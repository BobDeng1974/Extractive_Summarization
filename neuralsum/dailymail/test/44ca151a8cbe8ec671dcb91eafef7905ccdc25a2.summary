@entity0 made another appearance in @entity2 on thursday to cheer on her golfer boyfriend @entity3 while he goes after a fifth masters championship after back surgery temporarily put his career on ice last year			1
@entity9 ' children were n't around this time , though			0
and without them , ski champ @entity10 looked less like the beautiful stepmom and more like a girlfriend concerned for her struggling beau			2
@entity10 's sympathy should come as no surprise , not only because she is girlfriend			1
she 's also come roaring back from her own terrible injuries			2
and @entity3 is no doubt hoping he can pull off a feat like @entity10 's breathtaking return to alpine skiing , in which she most recently won her 67th @entity42 downhill skiiing championship , according to the @entity44			1
still , @entity10 appeared worried as she watched @entity9 flash his notorious temper on a couple of errant shots as he struggled to prove he 's still no. 1 worldwide -- and not no. 111 , where his rank plummeted following back surgery last year			1
@entity10 appeared to sweat it out along with @entity3 after he yanked his tee shot into the adjacent first fairway and let the club fall from his hands in disgust while he stood frozen , staring incredulously at the flight of his ball			1

the 39 - year - old @entity96 , who missed last year 's masters after surgery , three - putted the first hole for a bogey but balanced that with a birdie at the par - five second after a great approach shot to five feet			2
he then failed to cash in at the short par - four third after a booming tee shot left him just short of the green at the 340 - yard hole			0
choosing to chip rather than putt , @entity3 hit it strong and rolled some 15 feet by and two - putted for a disappointing par. not playing stepmom : on wednesday , @entity10 showed up in @entity2 alongside @entity3 's two children with ex-wife @entity112			1
on thursday , the kids were nowhere to be seen standing out : @entity10 watches play on at the 6th hole during round 1 of the 79th @entity33 at @entity93 woods then bogeyed the long par - three fourth after finding the front bunker			1
the 14 - times major winner blasted out strong and took two to get down for another bogey			0

playing stepmom : seen here thursday , @entity10 holds up her dress from the grass as she talks to @entity3 's children , @entity146 ( center ) and @entity145 ( right ) @entity10 's dress appeared to pool on the grass as she spoke to @entity3 , standing next to @entity96 golfer @entity159			1
