councillor @entity1 protest took her 30 miles across @entity2 by her own admission her feet were killing her by the end			1
but for @entity1 dragging a wheelie bin 30 miles across roads in @entity2 to make a point was entirely worth it			1
the councillor is so incensed at plans to force residents into waiting three weeks for their rubbish to be collected that she took to the streets in protest			1
yesterday she told bureaucrats that the majority of residents in @entity19 , which includes the popular seaside resorts of @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 , were against the proposals , as she presented a 5,000 name petition to a meeting of the full council			1
‘ the saying goes that you are never more than a few feet from a rat , but do we really want that to become a few inches ? ’ councillor @entity1 said			2
‘ i ’ve walked about 30 miles across the county in the past few days – my feet are killing me , but it is worth it because this is a very serious issue			1
‘ experts say there will be a huge increase in the rat population , their faeces and urine can produce very dangerous diseases			2
‘ going to three weekly collections poses a real threat to public health			1
’ the plan to move from fortnightly to three weekly bin collections was rubber stamped by the @entity54 dominated cabinet , of the @entity57 - run council in april			1
they will be the first local authority in @entity60 to move to three weekly collections when it comes into operation in october			1
the move follows @entity64 in @entity65 last month and @entity66 , in @entity67 , which voted to do the same on wednesday evening			0
@entity19 claims the move is in response to tough targets from the @entity72 - run @entity71 , which fines councils who dump too much waste in landfill sites , and will save them around £ 350,000 a year			0
but locals say they were n’t properly consulted and are ‘ disgusted ’ by the proposals , which they claim could see rotting rubbish left out on the streets for weeks on end			1
waiting three weeks between rubbish collections posed a ' real threat to public health ' , councillor @entity1 said they say the move will attract rats , see seagulls scavenging around their homes and lead to a rise in fly tipping			1
as many as 12 binmen could also be made redundant as a result of the changes			0
local businessman @entity97 , 49 , was among 20 locals who turned up outside @entity100 council chamber to add his support for councillor @entity1 ’ protest yesterday			2
waving a placard with the slogan ‘ @entity105 ’ or ‘ @entity106 ’ in @entity71 , he said : ‘ i ’m very worried about the health risks			0
‘ we live close to terraced houses , with multiple occupants , and bin bags are already left out on the street for rats and seagulls to get at , that ’s only going to get worse if we go to three weekly collections			1
‘ we ’re just not getting value for money from our council tax			0
’ another protestor , semi-retired nurse @entity120 , 59 , said : ‘ we recycle , but there are some things that just have to go in the bin			0
‘ on a day like today ( when it is hot ) and our bins are full we have flies buzzing around already , so to have rotting food around for three weeks will be disgusting			0
’ about 5,000 residents of the @entity130 ( pictured ) signed a petition opposing the new collection times her husband , @entity143 , 65 , a retired @entity145 captain , added : ‘ when i was a lad the binmen came around the back of my house , lifted the bins up onto their shoulders and carried them to be emptied			2
now we have to lug our own bin around the front , then the binmen have a machine to pick up the bin and put it into the lorry – it ’s all about health and safety is n’t it ? we ’re doing their job for them and then the council tax goes up			2
’ but leader of the council @entity153 denied the plans were simply about cost saving			0
‘ we are doing this to increase recycling , ’ councillor @entity153 said			2
‘ fifty per cent of the county ’s population do recycle , but that means fifty per cent do not			0
‘ we have to change things			0
’ last year @entity162 narrowly avoided being fined more than £ 120,000 by the @entity164 administration for the amount of rubbish sent to landfill			0
it has been told it must recycle at least 52 per cent of all refuse collected from homes , increasing to 58 per cent by 2016 .			0

@entity2 councillor so angry at *decision* to reduce rubbish collections to every three weeks she drags wheelie - bin 30 miles across @entity60 in protest
she then presented a 5,000 name petition to the council claiming the three - weekly collection was a ' real threat to public health '
locals say they were not properly consulted , are ' disgusted ' by the idea and warn there will be an increase in rats , seagulls and fly tipping
