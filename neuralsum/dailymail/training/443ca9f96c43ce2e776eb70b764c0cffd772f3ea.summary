by @entity0 ouch : the six inch pencil that became embedded in 13 - year - old @entity3 's hand , leaving him in agony a thirteen - year - old was left in agony after a hospital sent him home twice with a pencil embedded in his hand			1
@entity10 , of @entity11 , @entity12 , was larking about with his friends when the six - inch pencil wedged inside his skin , leaving him in severe pain			1
his mother @entity18 rushed him to @entity20 's accident and emergency department , where he was told to come back the following day for an operation			1
but when the pair returned the next morning , they were told @entity3 ’s name was not on the list , and the operation would have to be rescheduled for another time			0
desperate mrs @entity28 was then forced to take her son 20 miles from their home to @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity34			1
doctors there operated immediately and @entity3 stayed in hospital for two nights on an antibiotic drip to ensure the injury would not become infected			1
mrs @entity3 said : ' @entity3 was in agony and the pencil was protruding from his hand but the staff at @entity20 did n’t seem that concerned			1
' you would have thought it was something they could have done straight away but they just left the pencil where it was , put a bandage over it and said he would have to come back			2
' i was concerned because i thought if he knocked his hand the pencil could go even further inside and cause serious injury			1
' i was disgusted at their attitude because i feared he could lose his hand through infection			0
' i was told he would need an operation but they could n’t do it until the following morning so he was sent home with the pencil still embedded in his hand			1
' the staff did n’t even check the wound			0
it was only when i asked about infection that they gave us some antibiotics			0
stressed : @entity10 , 13 , and his mother @entity18 , after their ordeal at @entity20 ' i could n’t believe what i was hearing when we went back the following day and was sent home again			1
' he needed treatment quickly so i drove straight to @entity83			0
i told them the story and they could n’t believe that the pencil had been left in his hand for so long			2
the staff there were absolutely amazing			0
' a spokesman for the @entity20 said : ' @entity3 was seen by the a and e team who were concerned and asked an orthopaedic surgeon to assess him			2
' @entity3 was then listed for surgery the next morning and sent home with painkillers to rest and fast overnight in preparation			0
' unfortunately , due to a number of very urgent cases @entity3 ’s operation was postponed			0
we apologised and gave him further painkillers and antibiotics			0
' we apologise to @entity3 and his family for the fact we could not operate on him when planned			0
' anger : @entity3 went twice to @entity20 with his injury but was sent away on both occasions			2

@entity10 was playing around with friends when a six - inch pencil *speared* his hand
his mother was *furious* when @entity20 sent him home twice without removing it
she drove him 20 miles to another hospital , where staff operated immediately
