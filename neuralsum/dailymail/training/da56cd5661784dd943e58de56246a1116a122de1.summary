@entity0 did what any of us would do after a dismal few months at work - by jetting off and taking in the sun and beach in @entity6			1
and it looks to be doing the trick , as the @entity10 and @entity11 midfielder posed for photographs and went for a dip with his model wife @entity15			1
@entity11 crashed out of the @entity16 in dismal fashion , leading the 34 - year - old to ponder whether to continue playing internationally or retire			2
the midfielder , though , is mainly focusing on getting ready for the new season as @entity10 prepare for another @entity51 title race after falling at the final hurdle last year			0
@entity54 ' men will travel to @entity56 side @entity55 , tour the @entity57 , and host @entity58 in a friendly at @entity60 on august 10			0
it will be a welcome change for captain @entity0 after the @entity11 gave a less - than - impressive account of themselves in @entity32			0
touching down : @entity0 arrives back home after @entity11 's miserable @entity16 campaign in @entity32 in limbo : the 34 - year - old is yet to decide whether to continue playing international football			2

@entity0 and wife @entity15 relax in @entity6 after @entity16 exit
@entity11 could *n't* *escape* @entity72 , *losing* twice and drawing once
@entity0 has holiday ahead of @entity10 *pre-season* tour of @entity57
