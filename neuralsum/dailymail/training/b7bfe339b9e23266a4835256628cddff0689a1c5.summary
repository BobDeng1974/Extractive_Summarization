ministers are considering introducing lessons in ‘ mindfulness ’ – a growing movement based on ancient eastern traditions of meditation			2
schools minister @entity15 said evidence suggested the sessions could help boost pupils ’ attitudes and motivation			1
teaching children how to meditate and breathing techniques can help them cope with stress and pay attention , it is claimed he said the government was ‘ very interested ’ in promoting mindfulness , which teaches participants to relate directly to whatever is happening ‘ in the moment ’			1
the revelation follows calls from a leading public school headmaster for schools to set aside time for quiet reflection every day			1
@entity37 said a ‘ daily stillness period ’ would help improve children ’s concentration and reduce levels of anxiety and depression			1
he has championed the practice at his school , @entity45 , in @entity46			2
now ministers have disclosed they believe mindfulness techniques ‘ certainly merit consideration ’ and education minister @entity51 has been actively looking into the practice , it emerged			2
giving evidence at the @entity55 yesterday , @entity53 mr @entity15 was asked whether the @entity56 planned to promote mindfulness courses to boost children ’s wellbeing			1
in reply , he said : ‘ we are very interested in promoting this and we certainly think that it ’s an area that merits consideration based on the evidence we ’ve seen to date			0
my colleague @entity51 actually has been looking at this recently			0
’ asked to explain the concept of mindfulness , he said : ‘ it ’s about trying to impact on people ’s motivations , their attitudes to life			1
it ’s about trying to get at some of the things we do n’t always get at through our crude technical interventions			0
education minister @entity15 said said he thought in ' mindfulness ' should be taken seriously in helping to improve pupils ' ' attitudes to life ' ‘ it ’s an area that we should take seriously while making sure that there is proper evidence - based scrutiny of it			1
’ rooted in ancient @entity88 practices , the modern mindfulness movement has been gathering momentum over the last 30 years			1
advocating the practice , dr @entity37 said the decline of religious assemblies had reduced opportunities for pupils to ‘ reflect during the school day ’ , just as large numbers of children faced unprecedented levels of stress and anxiety			2
pupils ’ concentration had also been eroded by the ‘ incessant chatter ’ of modern life , he said , with children spending a large amount of time on social networks such as @entity108 and @entity109			1
@entity45 has a mindfulness programme that involves two - minute ‘ stillness ’ periods each day			0
pupils aged between 13 and 15 have a further 15 - minute session each week			0
dr @entity37 added : ‘ mindfulness or meditation has been shown to be an invaluable tool to help bolster young people ’s resilience to psychological stress			0
it also boosts concentration , depth of thought , happiness and achievement			0
‘ it is the most simple and natural technique to learn … it is all about being yourself , making the most of yourself , and making the most of the opportunities that life presents to you			1
it promotes trusting relationships , healthy living and psychological and emotional security			0
’ he said schools had a duty to give pupils time to think , free of daily work , mobile telephones and the internet			2
dr @entity37 has previously pioneered wellbeing lessons , because he had seen during his time as a teacher ‘ far too many tortured and unhappy pupils who have achieved four or five a grades at a-level ’			0
schools should teach such life skills , he added , ‘ while individuals are still having their characters and habits formed ’			1
inspired by ancient @entity88 meditation , mindfulness courses were developed in the late 1970s by @entity156 doctors to combat stress			1
the therapies aim to help people live more ‘ in the moment ’ and spend less time going over past stresses and worrying about future problems			0
techniques include moving the focus of attention around the body and observing sensations that arise – the so - called ‘ body scan ’			0
others involve concentrating on breathing or completing yoga - style movements and observing sensations in moments of movement and stillness			0
mindfulness is said to help people recognise and overcome negative thoughts while noticing small pleasures around them			0
although some regard it with scepticism , studies appear to show a clinical benefit for treating a range of mental health problems			2
thousands of mindfulness sessions are prescribed to @entity189 patients every year to help treat anxiety and depression			2
celebrity adherents of the now secular practice include @entity196 actresses @entity194 and @entity197 .			0
