one of @entity1 ’s highest paid executives prompted outrage last night by insisting that his £ 1million basic salary is ' very low ’			1
sir @entity5 , head of advertising giant @entity6 , rejected criticism of executive pay in the wake of a study showing it rose by almost 50 per cent in the past year			1
@entity11 described the huge increases commanded by bosses at a time when ordinary workers have had their incomes squeezed as ' disturbing ’			1
high flying : sir @entity5 , pictured with his wife @entity17 , said his pay as head of advertising giant @entity6 is very low and deputy prime minister @entity21 said it was a ' slap in the face ’ for employees , seizing on the astonishing rise as evidence that tax cuts for the low paid should take priority over scrapping the 50p top tax rate			1
but sir @entity5 , 66 , said his bumper income , which rose by 83 per cent to £ 4.2million last year , was fully justified and was mostly linked to the firm ’s performance			1
he added that he considered his basic salary , of just over £ 1million , to be ' very low ’			1
condemnation : @entity21 ( left ) and @entity11 have both said bumper pay rises for @entity1 's top bosses are unacceptable but his comments astonished @entity41 and infuriated union leaders			2
labour education spokesman @entity43 described the huge rise in executive pay as ' grotesque ’ , adding : ' what planet do these people live on ? ’ @entity49 , chair of the @entity50 which is looking into executives ’ remuneration , said the performance - related pay deals enjoyed by executives ' do n’t really work ’			2
commenting on the study by the research group @entity57 , she added : ' i think it is very hard to justify these sorts of pay increases when we have seen companies ’ share prices go down , profits down , companies laying off staff , and when average wages are going up 1 or 2 per cent , not even keeping up with price rises			2
’ but in an interview with the @entity71 , sir @entity5 angrily defended his bumper pay packet			1
he said : ' the only planet i am living on is looking at our company in terms of the competition – that ’s the planet			2
we need to maintain a competitive position			2
the @entity1 only accounts for 12 per cent of our business			2
we have more @entity80 , @entity81 , and @entity82 than we have @entity83 and @entity84			0
' in 2009 it was a tough year for us and compensation across the board fell			1
in 2010 we delivered record profit			0
' people are not distinguishing between fixed pay and incentive pay			0
i do n’t sell my stock			0
other people , including our competitors , do			0
the value of the business has grown from £ 1million to £ 8.5billion over its life			1
’ however , there was little sympathy for him among ordinary workers outside @entity6 ’s offices in @entity104 last night			1
one of the firm ’s delivery men , who declined to give his name , said : ' to say that his salary is not very much is really insensitive			0
i ’m not earning that much , no one is			0
’ @entity112 , a street cleaner working next to the building , said : ' i work here every day on minimum wage and i work weekends just to pay the bills			0
it ’s been really hard even finding work during the past few years			0
it just shows how out of touch he must be			0
’ yesterday ’s report by the @entity57 showed pay among directors of @entity1 ’s @entity126 companies had risen by 49 per cent last year			1
it now averages £ 3.8million			1
the prime minister said the increase was ' not okay ’ when millions were facing pay freezes and called for ' transparency , proper accountability and a sense of responsibility from boardrooms ’			0
and @entity138 , leader of the @entity140 workers ’ union , said : ' the same top bosses demanding wage restraint and attacks on workers ’ rights on the shop floor have been caught stuffing their own pockets in the boardroom			0

@entity6 boss sir @entity5 said his income , which rose by 83 *%* to £ 4.2million last year , is fully justified
