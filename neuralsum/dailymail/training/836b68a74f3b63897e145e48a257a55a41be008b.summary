a couple booking a two - week holiday to @entity2 were left £ 600 out of pocket after they paid extra for a holiday bungalow , only to be put in a hotel room on arrival			1
@entity8 , 68 , and his wife @entity9 , 58 , wanted to stay at the @entity10 on the @entity2 island of @entity12 , but were disappointed to be told by @entity13 that the rooms were fully booked			1
instead , the holiday company offered the couple , from @entity16 , @entity17 , a stay in a bungalow on the property for £ 578.86 more			1
@entity8 and @entity21 have received a full refund after they were overcharged by more than half of the overall booking for a bungalow they never even got to stay in however , when the couple arrived at the resort , they were told the bungalows were fully booked and they would instead be placed in a double room			1
the @entity33 complained when they got home and despite admitting the brochure was ' confusing ' , @entity13 initially refused to refund the full amount			1
mr @entity8 was contacted by @entity13 's customer relations department which admitted the brochure description was ' really confusing			2
' the pensioner was offered just £ 260 in vouchers or £ 209 in cash in a full and final settlement but neither amount covered what he had been overcharged			2
however , after local newspapers took up the battle , the couple have now been given an apology , refund , and compensation from @entity13			1
the couple have accepted £ 700 after the company blamed a ' technical fault ' for charging too much			2
the @entity33 have been given a full refund , plus compensation after the booking blunder mr @entity8 said : ' i went to the @entity13 shop to book a holiday with a twin / double room at the @entity60 at @entity61 , @entity12 , @entity2			1
' the sales assistant told me no twin / double rooms were available on our chosen dates			0
' there was , however , a family bungalow for three or four persons but i would have to pay extra for under occupancy			0
' having studied the brochure we decided the @entity10 was where we wanted to stay , so i agreed , and looked forward to having a bit more room to spread out			0
' on arrival , however , it was a completely different story			0
mr @entity8 , said : ' we were told that no bungalows were available and that we would have to stay in a double room			1
' this , of course , was what we had wanted all along but a holiday that should have cost £ 1,118 cost me , somehow , £ 1,696.86 , meaning i was overcharged by £ 578.86			0
' it seems @entity13 and the @entity10 were not using the same data and , therefore , there was wrong information in the brochure			2
' the company admitted in email correspondence that the brochure was ' confusing ' but refused to compensate to the amount mr @entity8 had been overcharged			0
the @entity33 , from @entity17 , arrived at the @entity60 at @entity61 , @entity12 , @entity2 to be told their booking for a bungalow was not possible a spokesman for the company said : ' at @entity13 we pride ourselves on offering the best value holidays in the market			1
we would like to express our apologies to mr @entity8 for the inconvenience of additional charges incurred while on holiday			0
' these were due to a pricing discrepancy caused by a technical fault at the time of booking			0
' @entity13 would like to reassure customers that such pricing errors are rare and a full investigation has been carried out to ensure that there are no further issues of this nature			2
' we can confirm that mr @entity8 has now accepted a full refund for the extra costs and has stated that he is looking forward to booking his next holiday with @entity13			1
' @entity13 said that that the difference between what mr @entity8 was charged and what he should have been charged had been fully refunded - despite the earlier refusal - and they had also offered a gesture of goodwill by way of apology			0
mr @entity8 said he was delighted with the result			0
' they have refunded what i wanted all along and rounded the amount up to £ 700 , ' he added .			0
