a shocked diver has found an incredible 10,000 - year - old pre-historic forest under the @entity2 and experts believe it could have once stretched as far as @entity5			1
diver @entity6 , 45 , discovered the remarkable ' lost forest ' when she was diving just 300 metres off the coast of @entity9 , @entity10			1
she found complete oak trees with branches measuring eight metres long under the sea and experts believe they have been hidden off the coast of @entity10 since the @entity16			1
the forest is believed to have become exposed following the stormy weather last winter			1
experts say the trees have been hidden in the @entity2 since the @entity16 the 45 - year - old , who has been diving in the @entity2 for about 16 years , said she was ' absolutely thrilled ' to find the ancient oak trees			1
she said : ' you certainly do n't expect to go out for a quick dive and find a forest ' ms @entity6 , who runs the @entity28 's survey project , @entity29 in @entity30 with partner @entity31 , said she was ' absolutely thrilled ' with the find			1
she said : ' i could n't believe what i was seeing at first			0
' the sea was quite rough by the shore so i decided to dive slightly further out and after swimming over 300 metres of sand i found a long blackened ridge			2
' when i looked more closely i realised it was wood and when i swam further along i started finding whole tree trunks with branches on top , which looked like they had been felled			0
' it was amazing to find and to think the trees had been lying there completely undiscovered for thousands of years			2
you certainly do n't expect to go out for a quick dive and find a forest			2
' ms @entity6 , who has been diving in the @entity2 for about 16 years , said the trees are thought to have formed part of a huge forest , measuring thousands of acres			1
but it is believed the forest was drowned when the ice caps melted and the sea level rose 120 metres			0
the fallen trees are now lying on the ground where they have formed a natural reef , which is teaming with colourful fish , plants and wildlife			0
the prehistoric forest was discovered off the coast of @entity9 next to the @entity2 in @entity10 , pictured , it is believed the forest was drowned when the ice caps melted and the sea level rose 120 metres			1
the trees are now lying on the ground , where they have formed a natural reef , which is teaming with fish and plants the incredible forest is believed to have become exposed following the stormy weather last winter ' at one time it would have been a full - blown @entity81 - style forest , stretching for hundreds of miles , ' added mr @entity31 , who has begun surveying the forest with his partner			1
' it would have grown and grown and in those days there would have been no one to fell it so the forest would have been massive			0
' it would have looked like a scene from the @entity92 or @entity93 , which is something we do n't get in this country anymore			0
geologists are very excited about it , it was a really miraculous find			0
' the pair now hope that radio carbon dating will be carried out on the trees to discover exactly how long the forest has been there			2
mr @entity31 said : ' we plan to do more dives so we can map the forest and get an idea of its size and scale			0
it is hoped radio carbon dating will now be carried out on the trees to discover how long they have been there ms @entity6 said the trees are thought to have formed part of a huge forest , measuring thousands of acres ' it is extremely exciting as it may be hiding lots of undiscovered fossils of mammoths and sea creatures			1
' the forest bed is at the start of the chalk reef which forms the proposed @entity128 just to the @entity129			0
it is also near the @entity133 's @entity132 reserve , which is famous for birdlife			0
the area became a popular dive spot for the wildlife on a nearby wreck , the @entity135 which sank in 1914			0
last year , ancient forests were exposed along the @entity143 coastline after the storms washed away peat and exposed gnarled tree trunks on the shore near the village of @entity149 , @entity150 in @entity151 .			2

diver @entity6 found incredible ancient forest under the @entity2
the 45 - year - old discovered oak trees with eight - metre branches off @entity10
10,000 - year - old trees appear to have been hidden *underwater* since @entity16
experts believe pre-historic forest uncovered during recent stormy weather
ms @entity6 said she was ' absolutely thrilled ' with find off @entity9 next the @entity164
