@entity0 should be wary of adopting trendy pupil - led teaching techniques from @entity2 because they may be making standards worse , a new report claims			1
progressive education experts in the @entity0 have long pushed for our system to emulate the group work and independent study that is popular in @entity11 , which has regularly topped international league tables			2
but a new analysis of @entity11 education suggests pupil aptitude has actually declined since the country embraced fashionable teaching methods			2
pupil - led techniques : a new analysis of @entity11 education suggests pupil aptitude has actually declined since the country embraced fashionable teaching methods ( file picture ) according to research by the @entity25 - leaning @entity24 , @entity11 only did so well before because of the influence of traditional teacher - led methods			1
but it has slipped down international rankings tables as the new liberal techniques became more widespread			0
the findings will add weight to arguments by @entity34 that a return to traditional teacher - led lessons are the way to raise standards in schools			1
the former education secretary made it his mission to fight the ‘ progressive ’ methodology of the education establishment , which he referred to as ‘ the @entity45 ’			0
report author @entity46 said : ‘ my research shows that the methods that we have been trying to push through in @entity50 and @entity51 for years are not good for test scores			1
‘ pupils who are n’t motivated are not necessarily interested in learning			0
if you give them too much freedom , it ’s difficult to know if they ’re learning anything			0
it ’s not very effective			0
former education secretary : the findings will add weight to arguments by @entity34 ( pictured ) that a return to traditional teacher - led lessons are the way to raise standards in schools ‘ here in the @entity0 , there is a tendency to abolish traditional methods because they ’re old , but we need to decrease this bias			1
’ @entity11 was proclaimed an ‘ education superpower ’ after appearing at the top of international rankings tables between 2001 and 2009			2
many in the education establishment have pushed for the @entity11 model of pupil - led learning to be used as an inspiration for the @entity0 system			1
instead of giving whole - class instruction from a blackboard , teachers have instead adopted small group work , independent learning and educational activities and games			2
but today ’s report , which examines education policy and performance in @entity11 over the last half century , found implementation of the new methods coincided with a recent slump in performance			2
between 2006 and 2012 , @entity11 ’s performance in @entity98 tests run by the @entity99 ( @entity99 ) declined			1
it sunk by 18 points in scientific literacy , 23 points in reading literacy , and 29 points in mathematical literacy			1
in 2006 , it was second in the world for maths , while in 2012 it was 12th			1
rankings for reading and science also slipped several places			0
report author : @entity46 ( above ) said the methods ' are not good for test scores ' teachers training in the 1990s learnt the new methods and only began to teach them in the 2000s , the report said			1
before this , education in @entity11 had been traditional , hierarchical and teacher - led , according to the author , and it was this that was responsible for its stellar performances in the league tables			1
mr @entity46 added : ‘ the reforms in @entity11 that people are crediting with its improvement actually only began in the early 2000s			2
‘ when @entity11 was improving , the education system was very authoritative and teacher - led			1
@entity11 was improving in the 1980s but rounded off in around 1995			0
in the early 2000s , it started to fall			0
’ the report , titled ‘ @entity137 ’ , said that @entity11 ’s education system had instead been buoyed by socio - economic factors until recently			2
these included a strong work ethic and cultural sense of responsibility , as well as the high status of teachers leading to talented individuals entering the profession			0
mr @entity34 prompted a fierce backlash from teachers two years ago after saying he wanted them to stop using innovative approaches which ‘ dumbed down ’ education			0
he gave an example of ‘ making @entity154 models to represent @entity156 ’s main aims as @entity157 ’ as a method which had ‘ nothing to do with passing on knowledge ’			0
he said part of the problem was a ‘ belief that education should not be an activity in which the teacher imparts knowledge to the child but a pursuit - by the child - of what it finds interesting ’			0
mr @entity46 is director of research at the @entity24 for the @entity173 think tank .			0

@entity11 methods include pupils working in small groups or independently
in 2006 @entity11 was second in world for maths , but down to 12th by 2012
during period its test scores dropped 29 points in maths and 23 in reading
@entity34 has argued for return to traditional teacher - led lessons
