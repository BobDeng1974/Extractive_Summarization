a @entity2 , @entity1 couple was horrified when the baby monitor in their young child ’s room was taken over by a hacker who verbally attacked them and even used their daughter ’s name			1
@entity12 says he was doing the dishes following his birthday celebration when he heard strange sounds coming from 2 - year - old @entity17 ’s bedroom			1
he discovered they were coming from the baby monitor as a stranger ’s voice called his sleeping daughter an ‘ effing moron ’ and ‘ little slut ’ before he quickly unplugged it			1
the hacker then yelled at @entity12 and his wife , using expletives in what they described as a ‘ @entity52 or @entity53 accent			1
’ ' he said , ' @entity55 , you little ( expletive ) , ' " @entity12 said			1
though she has a cochlear implant , it was turned off and she was never bothered by the shocking intrusion			0
then things became even creepier			0
helpless : @entity12 says he believes his internet router was hacked and fears the intrusion has happened before without his or wife @entity64 's knowledge ' i see the camera move on us , ' @entity12 said			1
‘ at that point i ran over and disconnected it and tried to figure out what happened , ’ @entity12 told @entity68			1
the father of two did his research and now believes his home internet router was hacked and the monitor was subsequently accessed			2
‘ [ @entity75 ] could n't see the guy			2
all you could do was hear his voice and he was controlling the camera , ’ he said			0
@entity12 said it was no different a violation than if the hacker had actually entered his home			1
' it felt like somebody broke into our house , ' @entity12 told @entity88			2
even worse , the @entity89 are forced to wonder if the hacking had occurred in the past			0
‘ it 's quite possible that this had been going on more than one day , ’ he said			0
’ making the creepy just plain scary : @entity12 said he took all the typical precautions to keep prying eyes out of his home			2
' the router was password protected and the firewall was enabled , ' @entity12 wrote in the comments section of the @entity88 report			2
' the ip camera was also password protected			0
' like his sister @entity17 , the couple 's 3 - year - old son @entity104 also managed not to hear the shameless intrusion			0
but the terrifying experience has the @entity89 rattled enough to stop using the monitor that @entity12 says they once ‘ could n’t live without			1
’ ' @entity55 you little slut ' : the hacker even spoke the sleeping girl 's name , which was written on the wall above her bed taking no chances : now @entity12 is forced to wonder if the hackers had ever struck before			1
the father of two has decided to permanently unplug the monitor , which he once said he and his wife could n't live without ‘ i do n't think it ever will be connected again , ’ he said			1
the disturbing crime is n't unique , unfortunately			0
the newly - crowned @entity126 recently revealed she was secretly photographed in her room after her computer 's webcam was hacked			0
@entity131 , who took the crown on saturday , said she was horrified to learn a stranger had hacked into her computer before trying to extort her on the promise the photos would not be leaked			0
the 19 - year - old from @entity139 , @entity137 now travels the country to tell her story and warn other teenagers about cyber-crime			0
for his part , @entity12 has plenty of reason to worry about the safety of his family , who have not appeared alongside him in reports of the camera hacking			2
he wanted to tell his story in order that other families know to be careful not to share the same terrible experience			0
' as a father , i 'm supposed to protect her against people like this			0
so it 's a little embarrassing to say the least but it 's not going to happen again , ' @entity12 said .			1

the hacker cursed at @entity12 and his wife and even used their sleeping daughter 's name
@entity12 *ripped* the monitor from the wall and says he wo n't be using it again soon
