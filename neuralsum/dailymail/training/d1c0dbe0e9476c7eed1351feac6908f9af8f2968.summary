by @entity0 published : 11:41 est , 12 september 2013 updated : 19:43 est , 12 september 2013 @entity1 yesterday backed a college ’s controversial decision to ban pupils wearing the full facial veil for security reasons			2
all students , staff and visitors to @entity10 were told they must have their faces visible at all times so they are ‘ easily identifiable ’			1
but the move has been criticised by some students , one describing the policy as disgusting			2
today a protest organised on @entity17 – supported by the local @entity19 mp – is being held at the campus in central @entity21			0
two @entity23 students at the @entity10 campus in @entity25 , @entity26			2
the college have banned @entity23 girls from wearing a veil			0
eyes , nose and mouth all have to be visible split : @entity1 backed schools and colleges to enforce uniform rules but @entity37 said he felt ' uneasy ' about telling people what they should wear more than 800 people claimed they planned to attend to stand up to what they said was an ‘ islamophobic ’ decision			1
mr @entity1 ’s spokesman said the prime minister defended the right of educational institutions to be able to ‘ set and enforce their own school uniform policies ’			1
but deputy prime minister @entity37 said he felt ‘ uneasy ’ about a veil ban in a schools , although he could understand why it was needed to identify people at airport checkouts			1
the college which has 44,000 students and is the third largest in the @entity57 , say headwear poses a security risk and their policy ‘ includes the removal of hoodies , hats , caps and veils so that faces are visible ’			0
this would stop female @entity23 pupils from wearing the niqab , the full facial veil where only the woman ’s eyes are visible , or the burqa where the eye area is covered in mesh			0
controversial policy : staff at @entity10 , pictured , have said the guidelines are in place for ' security reasons ' outrage : @entity81 , 17 , believes the ban on veils is a breach of her freedom - this veil is not allowed because it covers all , but @entity81 's eyes student @entity81 , 17 , who studies applied sciences said : ‘ we would happily show the men at security our faces so they could check them against our ids , but they wo n’t let us			1
it ’s a breach of my freedom and i feel discriminated against			0
’ another 17 - year - old student , who was not named , said : ‘ it ’s disgusting			1
’ the prime minister ’s spokesman said : ‘ we back schools being able to set and enforce their own school uniform policies			2
’ @entity37 , asked about the decision on his @entity106 phone - in , told a caller he ‘ set the bar very high to justify something like that ’ he added : ‘ i ’ve always defended people ’s right to wear what they want and that ’s very much what i would apply here			1
’ the @entity116 said it is up to the governing body of a school to decide whether there should be a school uniform or any other rules about appearance , and if so what they should be			2
but @entity125 , the @entity19 mp for @entity126 , said she was shocked by the policy , and has written an open letter to the college ’s principal calling for an urgent meeting			2
in the letter to @entity133 , she expressed ‘ deep concerns ’ that it would deter young women from her constituency from attending the college			0
in a statement the principal said the policy , developed after consultation with students , ‘ will mean everyone allowed on the premises can understand and know each other in a safe environment			0
’ the college provides a-level and vocational training for around 9,000 16 to 19 - year - olds and 35,000 mature students			1
case by case : schools can outlaw veils but only after a consultation headteachers have the power to order students to remove veils after a series of high profile legal cases			2
in a key 2007 case , a high court judge rejected a bid by a pupil to be allowed to wear the niqab in class			0
although the 12 - year - old ’s three older sisters had worn the headwear at the same school in @entity174 , teachers said it impeded their ability to communicate with her			1
they said they needed to be able to tell if a pupil was paying attention , engaged with her work or distressed			0
after the case , the government issued guidance that enabled headteachers to ban full - face veils on grounds of security , safety or learning			1
it said teachers were justified in enforcing uniform rules which mean they can see and make eye contact with pupils			0
schools need to be able to identify pupils to maintain order in classrooms and to spot any intruders , it added			0
but rather than a @entity203 - style blanket ban on face coverings in all public spaces , the @entity201 said institutions could outlaw the coverings as long as they carried out a proper consultation			1
updated government guidance released last year clearly continues to back heads who choose to ban face - coverings			1
it says it is ‘ still lawful ’ to restrict the freedom of pupils to express their religion on the grounds of ‘ health , safety and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others ’			0
and religious freedoms do not mean pupils can practise their beliefs ‘ at any time , in any place , or in any particular manner , ’ the guidance adds .			0

@entity10 forces *teenagers* to remove items
staff say it is for safety and ensures people are ' identifiable at all times '
guidelines have divided opinion , with one 17 - year - old calling it ' disgusting '
@entity243 *insists* educational institutions can set their own rules
but deputy *pm* @entity37 says the bar must be set ' very high ' for a ban
