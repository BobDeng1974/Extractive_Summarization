three - year - old @entity1 , a @entity16 , has distinctive black and white markings which are very similar to the coat of @entity3 - a miniature spotted stallion			1
they are said to be inseparable and get taken on walks together and since 15 - year - old @entity3 is just 34 inches tall , the two animals measure up at about the same height			1
owner ms @entity34 , 63 , often takes them for walks together , putting them both on dog leads and parading them through her village			1

on walks , @entity1 sidles up to @entity3 and the pair settle next to one another at ms @entity34 's stable when she goes to muck out			1

she said : ' it 's adorable to see them next to each other - they snuggle when they 're next to each other , and @entity1 goes in to kiss @entity3 on the nose			1
' but when they are out together they tend to get a lot of double takes			0
' we regularly get people pulling out their camera phones to snap the phenomena of a horse and pony the same size strolling through the village			0
