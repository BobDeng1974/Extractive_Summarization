modern sprawling metropolises with their high - rise buildings and bustling streets might at first glance appear very different from the cities that existed 2,500 years ago			1
new research , however , suggests that @entity6 and @entity7 may not be all that different from the ancient cities built by civilisations like the @entity10			1
scientists have found that regardless of their location and origins in history , cities tend to grow in similar and predictable ways			2
ruins of @entity18 ( pictured ) , the capital of the @entity10 empire , looks very different from modern cities but the new research suggest it grew according to the same basic formula that determines city growth today they claim this is because the social and economic drivers behind a city 's expansion have been the same though out history			1
urban areas are more likely to be hit by frequent thunderstorms than rural areas of the same size , according to a new study			0
researchers at @entity37 studied radar data to pinpoint where thunderstorm initiations occurred across the southeast @entity40 between 1997 and 2013			2
they found that urban areas such as @entity42 are five per cent more likely to be hit by thunderstorms , on a given day , than rural areas of the same size			0
storms were more likely to hit these urbanised areas during warmer months , in july and august , in the late afternoon and early evening			0
and the study found more ' births ' occurred during the week than at weekends			0
the scientists behind the work say that increased pollution in urban areas may be responsible to the increased frequency of storms			2
urban areas also create ' heat islands ' that can lead to storm formation			0
concentrations of buildings also increase temperatures causing low pressures to form above cities , compared to high pressures in rural areas			2
this causes a so - called ' low - level atmospheric convergence ' , which forces air up into thunderstorms			0
buildings may also change the flow and direction of winds , which in turn changes pressure levels and affects the upward movement of air			0
their research that much like modern cities , ancient settlements were also subject to the laws of ' urban scaling '			1
this is where a city 's population outpaces the development of infrastructure while its production of goods and services outpaces the population			0
dr @entity89 , an anthropologist at the @entity90 and @entity91 in @entity92 , said : ' it was shocking and unbelievable			1
' we were raised on a steady diet telling us that , thanks to capitalism , industrialization , and democracy , the modern world is radically different from worlds of the past			0
' what we found here is that the fundamental drivers of robust socioeconomic patterns in modern cities precede all that			1
' dr @entity89 and his colleagues , whose work is published in the journal @entity113 , examined archaeological data from 4,000 sites in the area around @entity117			1
in the 1960s - before @entity117 's population began rapidly growing - surveyors examined all of the ancient settlements			1
the data spanned more than 2000 years of history from @entity123 - covering the period from the @entity125 to the @entity10 empire before @entity128 settlers arrived in the shape of the @entity131 conquistadors			2
the researchers used this to analyse the dimensions of hundreds of ancient temples and thousands of ancient houses to estimate populations and densities			2
they were also able to estimate the size and construction rate of monuments and buildings , together with intensity of use , to predict the output of each city			0
they found that the bigger the ancient settlement the more productive it was			0
@entity150 ( left ) is seen as a classic example of how modern capitalism and industrialisation led to city growth , but the same drivers were also at work in ancient @entity158 cities that have been reclaimed by the jungle in the pre-hispanic settlements around @entity117 , denser populations used space more efficiently , produced goods more rapidly and were more productive per household			1
these results mirrored what the team have observed occurs in modern cities			1
the researchers say that by allowing people to sustain social interactions on a daily basis , cities make it easier for populations to solve complicated problems			1
innovations like currency and literacy also tend to flow from cities and so help to speed up this process			0
the skyline of @entity7 ( above ) may look different , but the way cities bring populations together plays a crucial part in the way they expand and evolve , something that has occurred since ancient times the findings could help to explain why ancient civilisations from different parts of the world ended up producing cities that were surprisingly similar in structure			2
indeed , when @entity198 saw the @entity10 capital of @entity200 in 1521 , he wrote to the @entity131 king that the city was as big as @entity203 with surprisingly familiar boulevards , markets , canals , temples and courthouses			0
professor @entity209 , a researcher in complex systems at the @entity91 in @entity92 who was also involved in the work , said : ' our results suggest that the general ingredients of productivity and population density in human societies run much deeper and have everything to do with the challenges and opportunities of organizing human social networks			1

scientists at the @entity91 in @entity92 studied building use and economic growth of ancient cities built by the @entity158 and @entity10 empires
the ancient settlements grew according to the same rules as modern cities
they examined buildings at 4,000 archaeological sites around @entity117
researchers say social and economic drivers are the main forces at work
