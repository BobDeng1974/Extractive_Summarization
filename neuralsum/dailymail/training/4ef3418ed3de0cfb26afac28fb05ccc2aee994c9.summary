@entity1 will miss next month ’s @entity2 as he continues his rehabilitation from back surgery , the @entity0 announced on wednesday			1
the 38 - year - old world number three last week gave the strongest indication yet that he would not be able to compete at @entity7 from june 12 - 15 , admitting his recovery from his march 31 operation was ' slow and tedious ' and saying he was still unable to hit full shots			1
@entity1 said on www.tigerwoods.com : ' unfortunately , i wo n’t be there because i ’m not yet physically able to play competitive golf			0
concerns : @entity1 feared his golf career was over after suffering a back injury ' i ’d like to convey my regrets to the @entity19 leadership , the volunteers and the fans that i wo n’t be at @entity7			2
' woods , who underwent microdiscectomy surgery for a pinched nerve in his back eight weeks ago , has not competed since the final round of the @entity28 on march 9			1
he continued to remain positive about his future , though , adding : ' the @entity2 is very important to me , and i know it ’s going to be a great week			1
despite missing the first two majors , and several other important tournaments , i remain very optimistic about this year and my future			0
' this marks the sixth major the player will have missed since winning his 14th in 2008 at the @entity2			1
knee surgery following that victory led to an eight - month lay - off and caused him to miss the @entity2 and @entity42 championships			1

question time : @entity1 released a statement on his website confirming his withdrawal from the @entity2 that cast further doubt on his ability to surpass @entity60 ’ record of 18 major titles , but @entity1 was bullish about his prospects			1
speaking on may 19 , he said : ' the only doubts i had were prior to the surgery			2
i could n’t function any more			0
' i ’ve had knee surgeries in the past and , yeah , i was hurting going into it , but i was functioning			0
right before this surgery i could n’t do much			2
forget about playing golf at the highest level - i could n’t get out of bed			0
' i was certainly doubtful at that point			0
am i going to be pain - free ? am i actually going to be able to do this again where i can get out of bed and play with my kids and play golf ? ' but after i had the procedure it was immediate relief and just a matter of getting through that pain part			0
but it was n’t the shocking or debilitating pain - it was just pain from the surgery , the incision			2
' back pain : woods recently revealed that before his operation he struggled to get out of bed			0
