divers off the the coast of @entity2 were recently approached by a massive manta ray , but what could have been a rattling encounter for the scuba divers suddenly became an humanitarian mission			1
amazingly , the massive winged fish -- which was entangled in painful - looking fishing line -- appeared to be pleading with the international dive team for help being set free			1
the shocked divers obliged , cutting the thick cords from the ray , whose species can weigh as much as 5,000 pounds and have a wingspan of 18 feet			2
needed a favor : a team of scuba divers off the @entity2 coast encountered this giant oceanic manta ray this month			1
but they did n't go looking for the massive fish , it came looking for them entangled : the massive fish , whose species can reach 5,000 pounds , was entangled in some thick fishing line and approached the divers as if ask for some help getting freed painful : the divers happily obliged and helped from the painfully entangled fish from the line once freed , the manta did a backflip of joy and the astounding encounter was all caught on video by one of the divers			1
the men also kept a memento of the experience they had off the @entity44			0
' we picked up the line			0
it 's our trophy now ! @entity50 , the diver who cut the line , gave a little piece for all divers there ! the giant oceanic manta ray is the largest species of ray and is a type of eagle ray			2
scientists believe the ray has the largest brain of all fish species			0
however , they 've yet to determine just how intelligent the majestic , winged fish actually is			0
like other massive ocean animals such as whale sharks and the largest of whales , mantas are filter feeders and eat only the ocean 's tiniest organisms			0
the giant oceanic manta is believed to be highly migratory , routinely crossing entire oceans			0
free ! the ray did a backflip in celebration and to kick off that last bit of fishing line unforgettable : free and clear from the cord , the manta went about its way a free fish and the astonished divers kept the line as a memento of the unforgettable day			1

the gentle giant was entangled off the @entity88 of @entity2
it swam *fearlessly* toward the divers , who set it free from the *burdensome* , painful fishing line
