by @entity0 follow @ @ oliver_todd @entity1 has assured @entity3 fans that @entity4 will be signing for the @entity6 club this summer			1
@entity7 centre forward @entity4 returns to @entity9 training on wednesday amid talk of another move away from @entity12			2
and @entity3 boss @entity1 has fueled the fire by telling fans asking if @entity3 could sign the 21 - year - old : ' of course we 'll get him			1
and @entity3 's head of recruitment @entity37 has further fueled rumours of a move back to @entity41 for @entity4 , saying that he believes the striker wants a @entity6 return			1
' @entity4 had a terrific season for @entity3 last year and i know everyone at the football club wants to see him back , ' @entity37 told @entity48			2
' hopefully things can be sorted out , i think he ’s quite settled in his mind that he wants to come to @entity3 , and hopefully he ’ll be pulling on our blue shirt again next term			0
' our loan signings all did brilliant for us last season			0
@entity55 has signed permanently now which is fantastic , and hopefully @entity4 will as well			0
' rival : @entity58 rival : @entity60 rival : @entity62 rival : @entity4 i want that one : @entity1 was impressed with the @entity7 striker 's loan spell and wants him back trendsetter : @entity37 wants @entity4 to follow @entity55 by making a permanent move to @entity41 the 21 - year - old , who spent time on loan at @entity72 in the 2012/13 campaign , has also been linked with @entity76 big spenders @entity74 and , in the @entity26 press , with @entity78			1
but @entity74 general manager @entity79 denied that his club had made an offer on saturday			0
@entity83 's decision to re-sign @entity60 leaves @entity4 as one of four senior strikers at @entity9 alongside @entity58 and @entity62 , and with @entity9 favouring a formation featuring just one striker it looks likely that one of @entity4 or @entity62 will leave			0
