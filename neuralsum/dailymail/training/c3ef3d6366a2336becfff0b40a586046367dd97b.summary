by @entity0 for the @entity1 impeccably - bred @entity2 has been handed quotes of 20 - 1 for both the 2015 2,000 guineas and @entity5 after justifying a tall reputation on his @entity8 debut on sunday			1
the @entity11 - trained 11 - 10 favourite , who cost his @entity13 owners 2.85million euros , is a son of the late 1999 @entity15 winner @entity14 , who sired 2008 @entity5 winner @entity16 , while his dam is @entity18 , winner of the 2007 @entity21 and @entity22 1,000 guineas when trained by @entity23			1
@entity2 beat aared three - quarters of a length in the one - mile @entity25 under @entity26			1
class act : @entity28 rides @entity2 away from his rivals to win in impressive style at @entity8 while the initial success was inevitably the catalyst to a confetti distribution of bookmaker quotes , @entity2 can be credited with travelling smoothly throughout in a manner that demands he will be tested in a higher level			1
how soon that will be is as yet unknown			0
the colt holds a clutch of @entity42 entries but @entity26 said he would be in no rush to get @entity2 back on the track			1
the trainer added : ‘ it looked a good solid race and he travelled very strongly			0
he had to get tired going that gallop first time , but he cruised into the lead			0
‘ we ’ll take our time with him and wo n’t be in any panic			0
we ’d rather go gentle and see what ’s going to happen			0
‘ the good thing about him is he ’s a strong traveller and seems to have plenty of pace			0
looking at today he would n’t mind going back to seven furlongs			0
’ family victory : @entity64 ( right ) says he wo n't rush the horse , ridden to victory by his son ( left ) inevitably , given the strength of stock in his @entity72 stable in @entity73 and his success in the last three runnings of the race , @entity26 - trained colts dominate the embryonic 2015 @entity5 market			1
coral have the @entity22 trainer @entity82 winner @entity80 and @entity8 maiden winner @entity83 sharing favouritism at 10 - 1 while @entity2 is bracketed with unraced sir @entity85 , a son of @entity86 which cost 3.6million guineas as a yearling when sold at @entity89 in october			1
meanwhile , it was also a significant day at the @entity8 for jockey @entity91 , who won the @entity92 on @entity94 - trained @entity93			2
it was a first win for @entity91 in the colours of @entity97 since it was revealed that he will be replacing the retiring @entity98 as no 1 jockey to the organisation of sheik @entity101 and his brothers in 2015			2
trainer @entity103 , who won the @entity104 at @entity105 with @entity107 - ridden @entity106 , plans to return his 2,000 @entity108 in the @entity109 at @entity110 on september 14			2
return : night of @entity111 ( r ) could be back for the @entity112 at @entity110 in his first race since july the colt , which has n’t run since failing to stay a mile and a quarter in the @entity109 @entity116 at @entity117 in july , will be joined by stablemate @entity118 in the mile race providing the ground does n’t get soft .			0

son of @entity14 and @entity18 looks impressive in win on @entity8 debut
trainer @entity64 *refuses* to rush @entity2
prices fall to 20 - 1 fr 2000 guineas and @entity5
