the word at @entity4 ’s state - of - the - art @entity2 training complex is that the club will make a concerted effort to sign @entity8 striker @entity7 in january			1
what is for sure is manager @entity10 needs to inject some life into his misfiring forward line sooner rather than later			0
wednesday night 's @entity13 clash against @entity14 merely underlined the @entity17 club ’s need for a new striker once the transfer window re-opens			0
@entity7 is currently out with a long - term cruciate ligament injury , but scored 15 goals last term @entity7 has one @entity24 cap , coming in the 2 - 0 defeat to @entity26 at @entity27 last november between them , @entity4 ’ strike trio of @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 have scored five domestic goals this season			1
@entity29 and @entity31 have two each ; @entity30 has one			2
in short : not good enough			0
certainly not good enough for a team with aspirations of breaking into the @entity38 qualification places			0
it was @entity30 and @entity31 ’s turn to improve upon that dismal record on wednesday night			2
but , once more , chance after chance was squandered before @entity31 tapped in late on to put the result beyond doubt			0
@entity10 may raid @entity8 , with the likes of @entity29 ( right ) underperforming @entity30 has been disappointing since his move to @entity24 last summer from @entity48 @entity10 , upon his arrival from @entity8 in the summer , insisted he wanted to give those at the club a chance to ink themselves into his blueprint			1
but the @entity56 knows now he ’ll have to buy a new striker in january			0
his interest in @entity7 , a player he worked with and helped nurture at @entity59 ’s , is no secret			2
there was a willingness , certainly from @entity10 , to strike a deal with the @entity8 for the @entity24 international , whose long - term knee injury meant that @entity4 ’s interest cooled			1
@entity4 striker @entity31 ( left ) stretches to beat @entity67 ( right ) to the ball to score for @entity4 yet @entity10 inherited this @entity4 forward line , and until he is able to stamp his mark on it via the transfer market , he can not truly call this his side			2
those in the corridors of power at @entity17 know that , too , and are prepared to fund his move for @entity7 at the turn of the year			0
the @entity4 boss feels @entity7 ’s pace and movement can help transform his forward line for the final months of the season			1
persuading @entity7 to leave upwardly - mobile @entity8 for @entity4 might be harder than it sounds , though , and @entity10 will hope his relationship with the striker will lure him to @entity86 .			1

@entity7 is currently out with a long - term cruciate ligament injury
but @entity4 need *firepower* with strikers @entity29 and @entity30 not performing in the @entity92
@entity4 's interest cooled in the @entity24 man after his injury
but a return in january could be on the cards for the @entity4 boss
