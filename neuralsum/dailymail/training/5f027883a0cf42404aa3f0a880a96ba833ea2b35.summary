although @entity2 remained a figure head for extremists , he had little involvement during his final years holed up in a compound in @entity20 , @entity21			2
fixated : @entity2 watches himself on tv at his compound in @entity20 , @entity21 information found at the hide - out , where the @entity9 chief was killed on may 2 by @entity28 troops , suggested that @entity2 also had advance knowledge of several plots that failed			1

@entity9 also attempted to target the @entity47 in 2009 and unspecified targets in @entity49 last year			1
last moments : the bedroom at the mansion in @entity21 where @entity2 was killed after ten years in hiding the quiet extremist : a @entity21 shepherd herds his goats past the hideout of @entity9 leader @entity2 , who was killed by @entity57 in may one official said : ' @entity2 was absolutely a detail guy			1
we have every reason to believe that he was aware of @entity9 's major plots during the planning phase , including the airline plot in 2006 and the @entity12 7/7 attacks			1
' although there is no ' smoking gun ' evidence to prove he masterminded the @entity12 bombings , there is strong evidence that he was in close contact with other @entity9 militants as they planned the attacks			1

destruction : it has been confirmed that @entity2 was involved in planning the 7/7 attacks on @entity12 in 2005 videos released after @entity2 's death showed him as a vain man , obsessed with his own image and how he was portrayed to the world - even from the confines of the @entity21 compound			2
one of the films released by @entity28 security forces , shows @entity2 , his unkempt beard streaked with grey , sitting on the floor , wrapped in a brown blanket and holding a remote control			0
