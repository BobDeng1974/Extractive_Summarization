@entity1 , 10 , from @entity2 , @entity0 underwent a circumcision in @entity4 during the summer holidays there were ' missed opportunities ' to save a 10 - year - old from an infection possibly caused by a circumcision carried out in @entity12 , an inquest heard today			1
@entity1 , 10 , from @entity2 , @entity0 underwent the procedure in @entity4 during the summer holidays			1
nearly two months later on october 13 , 2013 he went into septic shock and died in hospital			1
at the time it was thought the infection might have been caused by an injury to his knee , either from being hit with a hockey stick by another pupil or while playing football			2
however , a leading doctor said the two theories were ' very unlikely ' to be the case			0
today , a coroner delivered a narrative verdict of @entity1 's death , and said that the fatal infection had not diagnosed because of a combination of ' unfortunate events and circumstances '			1
@entity1 , a pupil at new @entity35 in @entity36 , @entity0 , went with his family to @entity4 during the summer holidays last year and was circumcised on august 23			1
however , he was absent during the first week of the new term and his step - father , @entity40 , told a member of school staff this was because he had developed an infection from the circumcision			0
on october 7 his mother , @entity46 , took @entity1 to the @entity47 in @entity36 , with her son complaining about a knee problem caused while playing football			1
the inquest heard the injury may have been caused by another pupil hitting @entity1 with a plastic hockey stick			1
the inquest heard ms @entity46 took @entity1 to a gp again the following day , but there appeared to be no reason for major concern			1
on october 11 his mother spoke to a doctor over the phone and told them @entity1 had developed a chesty cough , abdominal pains and was not eating			2
she also said he was suffering from vomiting and diarrhoea			0
@entity1 was prescribed antibiotics and the doctor said the information his mother had given did not suggest he needed to be seen in person			2
at around 4.40am on october 12 , 2013 , paramedics were called to the family 's home in @entity75 in @entity2 , after a call to say @entity1 was unable to walk because of his knee pain			2
discussing the possibility that the circumcision was the cause of @entity1 's death , the @entity78 said : ' that evidence is , i think , at best confusing			1
it is certainly not definitive			0
that is the less likely explanation ' the paramedics said he was able to walk but that his breathing and oxygen saturation level were unusual and that @entity1 also had a slight temperature			0
an appointment was arranged for the boy to see a doctor at 8am the next morning , but he did not attend			0
dr @entity95 said : ' this was a pivotal moment in @entity1 's case because had he been seen by a doctor that saturday morning and appropriate treatment and investigations taken place , he might have been saved			2
' when @entity1 did not attend his appointment , the @entity104 service would normally have contacted the family , but a systems failure that day and the fact they could not find a number for ms @entity46 , made this impossible			0
the next day a paramedic was scrambled to the family home at around 7.40pm after @entity1 started having breathing difficulties			0
his right calf was described as very firm and swollen and the paramedic found marks on his thigh , which his mother said were healing boils			1
on arrival at the @entity47 , doctors diagnosed @entity1 with septic shock and said his chances of survival were slim			1
his condition rapidly deteriorated and doctors twice performed cpr before @entity1 was declared dead at 11.35pm			2
dr @entity95 told the inquest it was not uncommon for children with sepsis to die very quickly			0
the inquest heard that the boils on @entity1 's thigh could have been caused by the circumcision infection and dr @entity136 , a microbiologist who helped with the post-mortem examination , said the infection could have spread from the skin and into @entity1 's leg			1
coroner @entity141 said when @entity1 's mother told an out - of - hours doctor over the phone that her son had developed vomiting , abdominal pain and diarrhoea , he should be been sent for a physical examination			1
however , mr @entity141 added that the nature of the infection would still have made diagnosis difficult			0
pathologist @entity153 told the inquest that the most likely source of the deadly infection was boils found on his upper thigh			1
the inquest was also told that there was no evidence of @entity1 being attacked , with police investigating the matter after suggestions he was hit with a hockey stick prior to his death			2
delivering a narrative verdict , mr @entity141 said that despite @entity1 being seen by various healthcare professionals , they had not diagnosed his ' serious and developing ' infection because of a combination of ' unfortunate events and circumstances '			1
mr @entity141 added : ' it is likely that the source of @entity1 's fatal infection was boil - type lesions that developed in skin tissue and caused cellulitis in the right leg and then spread through the venous system into the lung			1
' there were missed opportunities to admit @entity1 to hospital earlier than october 13			1
' however , the virulent nature of the fatal infection and the difficulty in diagnosis because of the gradual onset of symptoms makes it uncertain , in my view , that earlier diagnosis would have affected the outcome			0
' discussing the possibility that the circumcision was the cause of @entity1 's death , which is disputed by his mother , mr @entity141 said : ' that evidence is , i think , at best confusing			1
it is certainly not definitive			0
that is the less likely explanation			0
' dr @entity153 said there remained unanswered questions about exactly where the infection came from			0
' we believe that this particular organism spread from the boils and settled in this area in the knee , ' dr @entity153 told the inquest			0
' i have never seen that before			0
' speaking after the inquest , his family said they would wait until they had received the coroner 's report and spoken with their lawyer before deciding what further action to take			2
ms @entity46 said : ' he was a lovely boy , a very happy boy			0
' it is one year this month that @entity1 has been away from his mother			2
' mr @entity40 added : ' we will forever remember him , there is no way we can forget him			0
