' at 5pm yesterday ( 9pm gmt ) , @entity1 had top sustained winds of 105 miles per hour and was about 365 miles north - northeast of the northern @entity35			1
the centre said @entity1 could become a ' major ' hurricane on monday , with maximum sustained winds of at least 111 mph ( 178 kph )			1
the uncertainty over the storm 's definitive track came because of @entity6 's presence over the @entity8			1

@entity9 specialist @entity94 said the flash flood threat could be more severe as the rains moves from the flatter @entity97 north into the rugged @entity98			1
closer to the @entity8 , the water is ' just going to sit there a couple of days , ' he said			2
' up in the @entity98 you get more threat of flash floods - so that 's very similar to some of the stuff we saw in @entity48			1
' @entity48 is still cleaning up and digging out dozens of communities that were damaged and isolated by heavy rain from @entity4 last week that quickly overfilled mountain rivers			2
