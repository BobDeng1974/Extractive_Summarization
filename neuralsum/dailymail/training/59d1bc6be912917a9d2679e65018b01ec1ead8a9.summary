a mysterious ' pyramid ' has been spotted on the surface of a comet that scientists are hoping will unlock the secrets to how @entity5 formed			1
the strange structure was discovered by the @entity8 probe as it orbited comet @entity9 297 million miles ( 478 million km ) from @entity5			1
at around 82ft - tall ( 25 metres ) , the structure is one of the larger boulders seen on the comet and could help scientists better understand its history			1
@entity37 has now named the structure @entity18 , after the largest of those pyramids , the @entity34 , which was built as a tomb for the pharaoh cheops around 2550 bc. @entity8 has spent 10 years chasing down comet @entity9 and is now in orbit around the ' ice mountain ' , edging in closer to its surface each day			1
for a sense of scale , the comet is about three times the size of @entity48 and @entity8 is the size of a car with 105ft ( 32 metre ) wings			0
the ' pyramid ' stood out among a group of boulders on the lower side of @entity27 's larger lobe – an area that has reminded scientists of the famous pyramids at @entity31 near @entity32 in @entity33 a patchwork of images of comet @entity61 from a distance of 10.5 miles ( 16.9km ) from the centre of the comet the @entity8 probe will launch its @entity67 robot from a distance of about 6.2 miles ( 10km ) to @entity69			1
the 220lb ( 100kg ) lander will reach the surface on 11 november			0
it will take around seven hours to descend			0
during the descent , images will be taken and other observations of the comet 's environment will be made			2
@entity67 will make a gentle landing on the comet at walking pace , using screws and harpoons to lower and secure itself on the surface			2
once the lander touches down , it will make a 360 ° panoramic image of the landing site to help determine where and in what orientation it has landed			0
the lander will also drill and collect samples from beneath the surface , delivering them to the onboard laboratory for analysis			0
the interior structure of the comet will be explored by sending radio waves through the surface towards @entity8			2
cheops was seen for the first time in images obtained in early august upon @entity8 's arrival at the comet			2
but in the past few weeks , as @entity8 has navigated closer and closer to the comet , it imaged the unique structure again – but this time with a much higher resolution of 50 cm per pixel			2
the boulder - like structures that @entity8 has revealed in many places on the surface of @entity112 have been described as one of the comet 's ' most striking and mysterious ' features			1
principal investigator @entity116 , from the @entity117 ( @entity117 ) in @entity118 , describes the surface of @entity18 as ' very craggy and irregular			0
' interspersed between the lighter lumps on the boulder 's surface are intriguing small patches of darker material , similar in brightness and texture to the ground upon which the boulder lies			0
' it almost looks as if loose dust covering the surface of the comet has settled in the boulder 's cracks			0
but , of course , it is much too early to be sure , ' says dr @entity116			0
apart from their size distribution , which is being measured through careful analysis of the images , almost all other properties of @entity27 's boulders are still a mystery to researchers			0

the boulder - like structures that @entity8 has revealed in many places on the surface of @entity149 are one of the comet 's most striking and mysterious features @entity37 has now named the structure @entity18 , after the largest of those pyramids , the @entity34 , which was built as a tomb for the pharaoh cheops around 2550 bc @entity8 took an incredible selfie of its 131ft ( 40 metre ) solar wings gleaming against the darkness of space last week			1
in the background is the duck - shaped comet , @entity165 , with its distinct ' head ' and ' body ' clearly visible as @entity8 continues to survey and monitor the comet 's surface in the next months , the scientists will be looking for clues to better explain the formation of the comet			1
' for example , if the boulders are exposed by cometary activity or are displaced following the comet 's gravity field , we should be able to track this down in our images , ' says dr @entity116			2
last month a 2.4 mile - wide ( 4km ) region on the ' head ' of comet @entity9 was revealed as the spot for the daring landing of @entity8 's @entity67 probe			1
the high - risk manoeuvre on november 11 , if successful , will be the first time in history that a probe has been landed on a comet			1
scientists at mission control in @entity118 hope the spider - like probe will send back data that could answer questions on the origin of @entity5 's water and perhaps even life			1
but they 've warned that the landing should be seen as an ' exciting extra ' on the @entity8 as the mission carries a ' high risk '			0
the reconstructed - colour image , taken about 10 days ago , indicates how dark the comet appears			0
on the average , the comet 's surface reflects about four per cent of impinging visible light , making it as dark as coal last month a 2.4 mile - wide ( 4km ) region on the ' head ' of comet @entity9 was revealed as the spot for the daring landing of @entity8 's @entity67 probe ( illustration shown )			1
the high - risk manoeuvre on november 11 , if successful , will be the first time in history that a probe has been landed on a comet			2

structure is one of the comet 's larger boulders seen by @entity8
it could help scientists better understand how the comet formed
it is in a region that reminded scientists of the pyramids at @entity31
@entity37 has named the structure @entity18 , after the largest of those pyramids , the @entity34 , which was for the pharaoh @entity18 in 2550 bc
on november 11 , @entity8 will send @entity67 probe to comet 's surface
scientists hope the spider - like probe will send back data that could answer questions on the origin of @entity5 's water and perhaps even life
