by @entity0 published : 07:41 est , 30 march 2013 updated : 11:30 est , 30 march 2013 @entity2 workers have gone on strike today in a row over jobs , pay and closures - saying they received strong support from the public over their action			1
members of the @entity11 in around 260 so - called crown offices took industrial action in protest at plans to close or franchise 70 branches			1
the union said the walkout was ' solidly ' supported by thousands of its members , with picket lines set up outside post offices across the country			1
the @entity11 said mps and local politicians offered their backing to the strikers , adding that members of the public were also showing support			1
the union said hundreds of jobs will be affected by the proposals , which it warned would cause further problems for high streets already suffering from shop closures			0
the @entity11 added that staff had not received a pay rise for two years			1
the @entity2 said @entity52 branches were losing £ 40million a year and accused the union of ignoring the ' harsh realities ' the company faces			0
@entity56 , the @entity11 's deputy general secretary , said : ' our post office members are standing up against destructive plans which would slash 20 per cent of the crown network and are simply asking for fair treatment and job security			1
@entity63 protests with @entity2 workers outside @entity65 in @entity29 ' @entity67 's plans are short - sighted and would rob the network of the most productive offices while simultaneously putting hundreds of jobs at risk and potentially damaging local economies			1
' we 'd like to see a better vision for a successful network which maintains services in the heart of communities alongside quality jobs			0
we 're confident this could be achieved if @entity2 management would agree to negotiations			0
' @entity82 , @entity83 and sales director at the @entity2 said : ' we regret any inconvenience caused to customers by today ’s strike action			2
' however , over 100 of our crown branches are open today and the remainder of our 11,800 branches are unaffected			2
' the @entity11 is ignoring the harsh commercial realities being faced by the @entity2 and other retailers across the @entity93			2
' crown branches are currently losing £ 40m per year and this is being subsidised by public money			2
' @entity67 is transforming its network to improve customer experience and in turn bring in new business			0
' we are committed to the @entity2 remaining a key part of @entity93 high streets and our plans ensure this will happen			0
' this means for 70 of our crown branches – less than one per cent of our network – we will be looking to partner with a suitable retailer , whilst at the same time we will invest £ 70m in the remaining 300 crown branches to modernise and grow services to ensure their long term viability			0
' our pay offer remains unchanged			0
we want to make the first payment of up to £ 1400 as quickly as possible			0
any future strike action can only cause further inconvenience for customers and delay how quickly this money will be received into our people ’s pay packets			2
' the union pointed out that crown offices handle 20 per cent of all @entity2 business .			1
