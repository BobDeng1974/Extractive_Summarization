a pilot on @entity2 national airline @entity1 branded @entity4 ' filth ' in a cockpit message while flying over the country and is a racist homophobe who calls them ' scum ' and ' killers ' on his open social media websites			1
in a series of sickening posts , @entity13 , 30 , repeatedly uses offensive terms to describe the people of the @entity4 , jokes about the @entity19 tragedy and a helicopter being shot down			1
the posts have come to light as tension between the two countries remains high after @entity2 annexed the southern @entity25 peninsula in march and continues to back rebels in eastern @entity4			1
@entity2 @entity1 pilot @entity13 claims he was misquoted when he was accused of calling @entity4 filth during an august flight from @entity28 to @entity29 on his open social media websites @entity13 repeatedly refers to @entity4 as filth , nazis and scum			1
he also makes light of the @entity35 tragedy which killed 298 people when it was shot down over @entity4 @entity13 's ' filth ' outburst stunned passengers on a scheduled passenger flight from @entity28 to @entity29 in august , which was tweeted by @entity42 diplomat @entity41			1
@entity41 wrote : '' @entity43 by @entity1 to @entity44 , captain to passengers : ' we fly over remnants of @entity4 , where @entity50 and other filth lives			2
'' the pilot 's words referred to @entity53 , seen as a fascist by many @entity2 for colluding with @entity55 but a hero by many @entity4 for seeking an independent state not controlled by @entity28			1
@entity1 did not apologise for the outburst but five days after @entity41 's original complaint , they tweeted a reply			1
' we 've studied your message , ' they wrote			0
' the fact was confirmed			0
the pilot had no right to express his personal opinion while on duty ... in this case the pilot has violated our internal regulations			0
we have started the internal investigation			0
' supporting @entity2 separatists @entity13 wrote : ' @entity4 invaders , go away from @entity2 land ' with a delicately placed @entity55 swastika , @entity13 posted a cartoon alongside the caption : ' @entity79 is not @entity80 ' @entity13 expressed his support for @entity2 leader @entity82 in yet another @entity84 post on his social media site but they have repeatedly declined @entity88 requests to reveal the outcome or whether @entity13 was grounded or disciplined			1
using an online forum for flight crew @entity13 , who has been flying with @entity1 since 2007 , confessed that he was wrong to make the comments but claimed that he had been misquoted			1
' i am that very captain who allegedly abused the @entity4 people , ' he wrote ' my words were flipped 180 degrees			2
abuse was added to them and even words i do not know			0
he added : ' i have discussed it with the management			0
of course , i confess it that i was wrong			0
i violated @entity1 's standards by having added that we were flying over the remnants of @entity4			1
' but his seemingly contrite words do not match the vitriol on his own social media account on which he repeatedly uses the word ' filth ' to describe @entity4			1
next to a picture of an empty grave , @entity13 who is married to 27 - year - old @entity114 with whom he has a two - year - old daughter , wrote : ' the only way @entity53 filth can get the lands of the south east ( @entity4 )			2
' @entity13 wrote : ' nobody has ever put @entity121 on its knees and no one will do ' referencing @entity4 president @entity124 , who made his fortune in the confectionery business , @entity13 calls him a ' chocolate gay ' on another of his hate filled diatribes he declared : ' @entity131 you are not my brother ' , while next to a picture of a man with a noose he wrote : ' pray , @entity53 , bastard			1
' in another post the pilot declares " no place for @entity142 on our land " showing a map of @entity146 that imagines @entity4 as a rump landlocked state totally cut off from access to the @entity151 and @entity152 seas			2
he also branded @entity153 - the former @entity157 foreign affairs chief - as ' @entity155 ' while another image declared : ' @entity158 will not pass '			0
apparently alluding to @entity4 president @entity124 who made his fortune in chocolate , he wrote : ' @entity160 get off @entity121			2
' bugaev with his wife @entity114 , 27			0

' making light of the @entity174 tragedy which killed 298 people , including 10 @entity176 , he blames the @entity4 forces for the tragedy			1
' the tradition of the @entity4 army is to hit a plane once every 13 years , ' he stated flippantly			2
both pro-russian separatists and the @entity4 have blamed each other for the tragedy			2
alongside his tirades also posted pictures showing him on foreign trips in @entity55 , @entity188 , @entity189 , and @entity190 in @entity191			0
seeking to explain his anger towards @entity4 , on the flight crew forum he said was raised in ' beautiful ' @entity196 , a region now substantially separatist hands , less than 50 miles from the @entity2 border			1
' my house in @entity196 where i spent all my childhood with my parents was destroyed by @entity201 , ' he wrote			2
' at the end of july i took my relatives away from @entity196 - two women with a small child , they live with me now and are still recovering			0
their husbands stayed there in the ( separatist ) self - defence , to protect their land and houses			0
' he added : ' at the border with @entity146 , in @entity79 town of @entity217 , i met people who were on the run , and i have never seen so much human suffering			0
these people have lost all they had at once but still they were happy to get out of the hell and to be alive			0
' accepting he went too far in his flight deck remarks , he thanks other pilots ' for your support ' adding : ' i am so pleased to experience our @entity229 nation getting together '			0
he claimed : ' i was stupid to blurt out too much , but i abused nobody			0
