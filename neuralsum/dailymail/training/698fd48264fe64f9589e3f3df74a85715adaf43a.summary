by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:07 est , 19 march 2013 updated : 03:02 est , 20 march 2013 calls were growing last night for the embattled head of the @entity4 , sir @entity5 , to quit calls were growing last night for the embattled head of the @entity4 to quit after he admitted misleading mps over a whistleblower			1
sir @entity5 – described by critics as the @entity12 – received a letter from former trust boss @entity14 four years ago raising concerns about patient care			1
but on monday sir @entity5 told a @entity18 that mr @entity14 ‘ did n’t identify himself as a whistleblower ... nor did he raise with me any issues of patient safety ’			1
yesterday the @entity4 chief executive issued a humiliating correction after the original letter , which contradicted sir @entity5 ’s account , emerged			1
the admission is damning for sir @entity5 as it suggests mr @entity14 , who broke a £ 500,000 gagging clause to reveal poor standards of care and a ‘ culture of fear ’ , may not have been offered adequate protection as a whistleblower			1
sir @entity5 ’s climbdown came on the same day that a leaked letter emerged revealing he has asked senior managers awaiting ‘ substantial ’ redundancy payouts to wait six months before reapplying for @entity4 jobs			1
one of the aims , says sir @entity5 , is to avoid ‘ reputational damage ’ to the health service			2
the letter will be seen by his critics as further evidence that sir @entity5 is presiding over a culture of secrecy within the @entity4 as he effectively urges managers to keep quiet about their pay - offs			1
he is already facing calls to step down over his role in the @entity52 scandal where up to 1,200 patients are feared to have died needlessly			0
yesterday he wrote to @entity55 chairman @entity54 to ‘ correct one specific point of detail ’			0
he wrote : ‘ in response to a question from @entity60 mp about @entity14 , i said that when he initially wrote to me , i thought that he did not identify himself as a whistleblower			2
‘ i have now had the opportunity to review the correspondence and would like to confirm that when @entity14 wrote to me in july 2009 he did indeed ask to be considered as a whistleblower			1
’ he continued : ‘ however , i would reassure you that the action i took at the time in response to @entity14 ’s letter was appropriate			0
‘ as i explained yesterday , i immediately commissioned a comprehensive independent investigation into the allegations that had been made			0
’ mr @entity14 , former head of @entity73 , was sacked in 2010 , allegedly for swearing in a meeting			2
cure the @entity4 protestors campaigning for the resignation of sir @entity5			1
a leaked letter emerged revealing he has asked senior managers awaiting ' substantial ' redundancy payouts to wait six months before reapplying for @entity4 jobs he maintains the real reason was his refusal to prioritise waiting list targets over emergency care for patients			2
@entity87 mp @entity86 said it was now ‘ impossible ’ for sir @entity5 to remain in his post			2
she wrote a letter to the prime minister telling him sir @entity5 should go ‘ with all speed ’			1
insisting she had the support of 60 other mps , she wrote : ‘ i am deeply concerned that the man who currently leads the largest employer in the country has not only overseen a culture that has damaged our @entity4 , but has now given a false account to a @entity101 in this way			0
‘ therefore there are serious questions of integrity to be answered			0
‘ if , however , sir @entity5 was really aware of none of this , it draws such questions over his competence and memory that he can not be a man to oversee crucial reforms			2
’ yesterday mr @entity14 contradicted sir @entity5 ’s account when he gave evidence to mps			1
in his 2009 letter , he wrote : ‘ i assume the @entity118 has a policy on whistleblowing and would therefore like this letter to be considered in that context			0
’ he also mentions the ‘ significant risk to patients ’ he believes was raised by attempts to force him out , and warns : ‘ this is the sort of behaviour that gave the country a @entity52			0
’ the letter also described a ‘ culture of avoiding accountability and blaming and harassing others ’			0
@entity60 , who sits on the committee said : ‘ he misled a @entity18 after being specifically asked about this twice			0
on monday , sir @entity5 was criticised by mps over his @entity4 expenses			1
last year he racked up £ 50,000 in claims , the cost of employing two nurses for a year , on top of his £ 211,000 salary ‘ he may have been woefully unprepared – or not expecting written evidence to catch him out			0
’ in response to mr @entity14 ’s letter , sir @entity5 commissioned the @entity146 into ‘ allegations of bullying and harassment ’ at the hospital trust			1
all staff were cleared of the allegations and sir @entity5 said they ‘ acted appropriately throughout ’			2
last night mr @entity14 said : ‘ he lied when he said i was not a whistleblower , and that my concerns were investigated as i raised concerns about patient suffering and they were not investigated			1
’ earlier he told @entity136 : ‘ if people had put allegations like i misled a select committee and that i had lied ... i would expect to be suspended and investigated			2
’ anyone judged to have lied to a @entity18 committee could face jail after being charged with ‘ contempt of the @entity164 ’			0
sir @entity5 is backed by @entity165 and health secretary @entity166 but insiders believe he will resign within months			0
