thanks to bean farmer @entity7 from @entity8 , who pioneered the art of weaving and pruning trees together , we have the basket - shaped and arch - shaped trees from his collection of ' circus trees '			1
the rest occur naturally in a phenomenon known as inosculation , when one tree bonds to another			2
@entity7 sculpted this single tree into an arch design in a secret method that had not yet been replicated the @entity24 , one of @entity27 's rare circus trees , was woven together from six separate sycamore trees taking many years to gently shape , graft and prune the trees , @entity7 created the odd trees , starting with his ' @entity33 ' creation - four trees which he grew into a single truck creating a gazebo effect in the middle			1
the basket effect tree required 42 separate connections between six sycamore trees in a secret configuration that no one else has yet been able to replicate			2
@entity7 started off the sculptures as a way to entertain his family but by the time of his death , he had a collection of 74 of these circus trees			1
he was inspired by nature as he noticed the elegance of trees weaving together on his farm			0
some trees are capable of creating unintentional art without any help from horticulturalists of the planet 's 400 odd billion trees , these are some of the most unusual and exotic they may look surreal but these trees are living and natural the trees were bought by millionaire @entity65 , who transplanted them from the @entity68 mountains to his amusement park @entity70 in 1985 , where they are still on display			0
other quirky examples of tree sculpture occur naturally as trunks contort due to extreme weather conditions or to fit round obstacles			0
given time trees can grow around just about anything , as seen in ruins around the world such as @entity83 , where trees have pushed through the foundations of the buildings .			0
