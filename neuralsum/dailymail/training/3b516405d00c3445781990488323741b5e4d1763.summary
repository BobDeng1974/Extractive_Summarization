by @entity0 a @entity2 advert featuring @entity4 actor @entity3 has been banned for promoting speeding and unsafe driving			1
the video was published on @entity10 ’s @entity9 channel and was titled @entity11			2
it showed the actor - perhaps best known for his role of @entity15 in several @entity17 films - playing a villain while driving a @entity19 in an underground car park and through central @entity21			1
an investigation was launched and , despite the car maker claiming the car barely moved in the advert , it was banned by the watchdog			2
last month the @entity31 banned a set of four video adverts on @entity2 ’s website showing a car travelling at speed through a tunnel and crossing over the single white lines in the middle of a road , before driving across a mountain road at night			1
it said the overall impression of the adverts was a focus on the speed and acceleration of the cars			0
it added that the cars were being driven on what appeared to be public roads and in a manner that would be ' irresponsible and illegal ' in the @entity59			0
on hearing about the latest complaint , @entity10 said the advert was set almost entirely in an underground car park and that during this time the car barely moved			0
another still from the advert shows the actor accelerating along @entity68			0
the @entity31 said this scene ' encouraged irresponsible driving ' another scene from the advert showing two stationary cars outside a building			1
last month , four other @entity2 adverts were banned by the @entity31 - also for promoting speeding and unsafe driving the car maker added when the car leaves the car park towards the end of the footage , it was shown to be travelling at normal road speeds			1
the company claimed that , although the vehicle accelerated briefly along @entity87 , the speed limit was not exceeded			0
in its ruling , the @entity31 said that - although the car 's appearance was the main focus of the film - acceleration and speed did feature in the footage			0
it said : ' whilst we acknowledge the sequences were brief , we considered that the second part of the ad suggested that the car was being driven at excessive speeds and that the ad therefore encouraged irresponsible driving			2
' it ruled that the advert must not appear again in its current form , adding : ' we told @entity10 not to portray speed or driving behaviour that might encourage motorists to drive irresponsibly in future			0
' last month a series of four @entity2 adverts were banned - including this one showing who cars travelling down a dust road - for promoting unsafe driving			1

@entity2 released latest advert @entity11 on its @entity9 channel
features @entity3 driving @entity19 through central @entity21
@entity31 ( @entity121 ) have now banned the film
watchdog ruled the advert ' encouraged irresponsible driving '
last month @entity31 banned four other @entity2 adverts for the same reason
