scientists have discovered a gene variation that affects the human body clock so profoundly that it even predicts the time of day when an individual is most likely to die			2
researchers hope the findings could eventually be used to determine when heart or stroke patients should take medication to make it most effective , or when hospital patients should be monitored most closely			0
the @entity14 team discovered the gene variation by accident when they were investigating the development of @entity18 ’s and alzheimer ’s disease			1
new research : the findings could eventually be used to determine when heart or stroke patients should take medication to make it most effective , or when hospital patients should be monitored most closely ( file picture ) they looked at the sleeping patterns of 1,200 healthy 65 - year - olds who were also given annual neurological and psychiatric assessments			1
differences : those with the @entity35 genotype died just before 11am on average , but those with the @entity39 genotype tended to die at just before 6pm they found a single molecule near a gene called ‘ @entity43 ’ that had as its base either adenine ( a ) or guanine ( @entity47 )			1
type a is more common by a ratio of six to four , so because people have two sets of chromosomes , an individual has a 36 per cent chance of having two as , a 16 per cent chance of having two gs , and a 48 per cent chance of an a and a @entity60 the findings , published in the @entity62 , showed that those with a @entity35 genotype tend naturally to wake up about an hour earlier than those with @entity39 , and the @entity65 wake up almost exactly in the middle			1
they also showed that those with the @entity35 genotype died just before 11am on average , but those with the @entity39 genotype tended to die at just before 6pm			2
the study ’s lead author @entity71 , from the @entity73 at @entity74 in @entity75 , @entity76 , said : ‘ the internal “ biological clock ” regulates many aspects of human biology and behaviour			0
it also influences the timing of acute medical events like stroke and heart attack			0
’ @entity85 , chief of neurology at @entity74 , said : ‘ so there is really a gene that predicts the time of day that you ’ll die			0
not the date , fortunately , but the time of day			0
