long after the @entity1 had marched into town for a victory ale and the last few staff remained inside @entity5 , one player partied by himself in the home dressing - room			1
not so long ago , the same young man would have been clearing that very room of muddied tape and empty bottles			2
for @entity11 was king of the castle			1
first , at @entity37 in the @entity38 , he out - ran , out - passed and out - thought @entity39 in a shock 2 - 0 triumph			1
then , against @entity27 and @entity42 in front of a global television audience , he was named man - of - the - match on his @entity25 debut in a 1 - 0 win for @entity1			1
the 22 - year - old later posted two pictures on his @entity51 account – one of him hunting down @entity42 and the other of a graphic detailing his seven tackles , more than any other player			2
but there was no need for such reminders , millions had watched as the rookie ruled against the master and @entity63 ’s @entity62			2
the 23 - year - old muscles @entity65 out of the way during @entity1 's win against @entity27 clubs : 2003 - 11 : @entity69 ( youth team ) 2011 - : @entity1 2012 - 13 : @entity71 ( loan ) 2013 - 14 : @entity73 ( loan ) international : played for @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 played for @entity78 trophies won : @entity80 2014 there were 52,166 inside @entity5 ’			1
two years ago , in front of just 2,500 , @entity11 was turning out for @entity71 during a loan spell in the @entity84			1
last season , though , he spent the entirety of the campaign in the @entity88 with @entity73			1
club sources , however , say that he travelled more than the 2,000 miles to @entity90			0
rather , he made the journey from boy to man			0
@entity11 , who now has a young son , has himself been fathered by the senior @entity15 players on @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 - and previously @entity100 - taking particular care with a comrade who left the eastern suburbs of @entity104 for the @entity105 of @entity63 aged just 18			1
but the fledgling , it appears , is ready to take flight			0
‘ it has been unreal , ’ he says			0
‘ to play against big sides like @entity37 and @entity27 in one week is fantastic			1
i am getting more and more experience and learning what it is like to play against big players			0
@entity11 chases @entity27 captain @entity42 during their @entity25 clash at @entity5 the @entity14 @entity78 midfielder attempts to squeeze past @entity37 forward @entity117 ‘ but i have to keep my head down and work every day to prove that i can be a solution for the team and for the coach			1
‘ you do n’t know how pleased i am – but i am not finished			0
i need to work every day and i want to judge myself against the big players			0
‘ i know that some days will be good and some bad , but i have been passionate and worked hard for four years – which have been difficult – but that is the way i work and play my football			0
’ his @entity29 odyssey was more than a mere learning curve , just ask @entity73 fans			1
they were desperate to see his loan stay made permanent after a return of 10 goals in 38 games , helping them to a third - placed finish and victory in the @entity80 , their first in four years			2
@entity11 takes the ball past @entity139 during @entity1 's 2 - 0 win against the @entity25 champions but reports of @entity11 ’s impact had way their way across the continent and into the possession of a somewhat surprised @entity147 , for the @entity1 manager had suspected it was time to move on the former @entity69 trainee			1
‘ i felt i grew a lot in @entity29 , ’ says @entity11 , offering explanation for his career revival			1
‘ i played 40 games and got a lot of experience			0
i grew up as a player and as a man – i want to keep going in that way			0
‘ i feel i ’m a better player			0
i wanted to play football and that ’s what i got			0
now it ’s about the next level and taking my chance			0
‘ the @entity25 is the biggest in the world and to be part of it is great			2
it ’s nice to be back and involved			0
i had a great season ( at @entity73 ) but now i need to build on that and show it here			2
’ @entity11 poses with the @entity80 , which he won while on loan with @entity73 last season on the evidence of the past week , it seems that @entity11 boasts craft , graft , brains and bite – he was sent off at @entity182 in the @entity183 and in his final league game for @entity73 – and has an eye for goal to boot			1
@entity147 feels the @entity14 under - 23 international is a genuine all - rounder			2
‘ @entity11 has good strength , good discipline , is a good passer and has a good mentality , ’ says the @entity189 boss , whose side have now won four on the bounce			2
‘ he has earned the right to play			0
hopefully he could be one of the young players who can be a regular for us this season			0
’ @entity11 certainly intends to stick around in the @entity1 first - team , for not even @entity39 or @entity42 can spoil his party right now .			1
