by @entity0 heavy snorers – and their long - suffering partners – have been given hope by a titanium tulip - shaped implant for the nose			1
the metal mesh device is inserted at night and opens up like the petal of a flower to prop open the airway while the wearer is asleep			1
it is then removed each morning			2
@entity13 is also suitable for sufferers of obstructive sleep apnoea , a more extreme manifestation of the problem in which breathing stops for short periods			1
at night , the soft tissues of the back of the mouth , nose and throat relax and may narrow			1
snoring is caused by these tissues vibrating during breathing			1
it is estimated that a third of men and almost one in ten women are regular snorers			2
the noises can also be a sign of obstructive sleep apnoea or @entity37 , which is estimated to affect around four per cent of middle - aged men and women			1
in @entity37 the airways close completely , blocking the flow of air into the lungs during sleep for more than ten seconds and up to more than two minutes at a time			1
left untreated , @entity37 can increase the risk of high blood pressure , heart attack , stroke , and type 2 diabetes			2
risk factors for snoring and for @entity37 include being overweight , alcohol use , being over 40 , having a large neck , using some medications including sleeping pills , smoking , and being menopausal , where hormonal changes can lead to throat muscles relaxing			1
@entity37 is also three times more common in those with diabetes , and twice as likely in those who suffer with chronic nasal congestion			2
treatments range from lifestyle changes , such as losing weight and stopping smoking , to soft tissue implants and surgery			0
continuous positive airway pressure or @entity72 , which involves using a device to assist with breathing during sleep , is considered one of the most effective therapies for moderate to severe @entity37			1
it involves wearing a mask over the nose to deliver a continuous supply of compressed air during sleep to prevent the airway from closing			1
common issue : it is estimated that a third of men and almost one in ten women are regular snorers although effective , it has been estimated that between 25 and 50 per cent of patients are unable to use them long term			0
some find the mask difficult to get used to , while some have problems with the noise of the @entity72 pump			0
unlike @entity72 , the @entity13 does not require a pump or electrical supply , and the wearer can move around with it in place			1
the device consists of a 160mm piece of braid or mesh made from nitinol , an alloy of nickel and titanium that springs back into shape after being handled			1
the braid comes in a long , 4mm - wide flexible tube which the patient inserts into a nostril and pushes through the nasal cavity and into the throat while lying down			0
after the tube is pushed into the airway , the user retracts it , leaving just the mesh in place			1
once out of the tube , the mesh returns to its pre-formed size and shape , and the end in the throat expands like a tulip flower to become 17mm wide , thus preventing the surrounding soft tissue from collapsing			0
the end of the braid protruding from the nose is taped to the cheek of the user , and in the morning , the patient simply pulls the mesh out of the nose			1
the developers say the challenge of insertion is no greater than that of putting a contact lens into the eye			0
a study at the @entity144 of @entity145 , @entity146 , also found that the new method worked as well as @entity72 therapy			0
if nasal congestion is the reason for problem breathing , another shorter device – the @entity150 – is designed to keep open the nasal airways alone			1
it has also been shown that it increases air flow by 47 per cent in healthy volunteers , raising the possibility of other uses			0
testing of the technology during jogging , cross-country skiing and mountain hiking suggests that it could improve breathing through the nose and sports performance			1
according to researchers , breathing through the nose increases the blood oxygen content by 10 to 15 per cent compared with breathing through the mouth			1
both devices are approved for use with patients in the @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176			0
@entity177 , a snoring specialist and a consultant ent surgeon at the @entity179 in @entity180 and at @entity181 in @entity182 , @entity183 , has used the device on some of the first @entity186 patients			1
‘ it is approved for use in the @entity186 and we now have the results from a study involving our first ten cases , ’ he says			0
‘ we found it was very effective for some patients , especially those whose snoring involves vibration of the soft palate			2
it is less suitable for patients where snoring is due to the collapse of the tongue base or for very severe @entity37			1
‘ this device is a useful addition because while @entity72 is the gold - standard treatment , compliance is variable , and the results from surgery are not always predictable , so that any benefits are not necessarily sustained			0
’ @entity211 , a 40 - year old software engineer , who lives with his wife @entity212 in @entity213 , was one of the first people to have the stent in the @entity186			0
‘ having tried mouthguards and being prescribed @entity72 , i found that the stent is the best , quietest and most comfortable of all the options available , ’ he says			0
‘ @entity72 was very noisy and was worse to live with than the snoring , according to my wife , plus it is not portable			2
i enjoy camping and going to festivals but i could n’t take @entity72 with me to them			0
‘ it was also very uncomfortable and my wife hated it			0
the mouthguards i ’ve tried all tend to fall out during the night or move enough to cease being effective by the early hours of the morning , which is when @entity212 would most likely wake up			0
‘ initially it was a tough learning curve – inserting something through your nostril every night is not the most pleasant of experiences – but it is worth it			0
i can now insert it without a mirror			0
‘ the stent has provided both of us with more undisturbed nights of sleep than all the other methods combined			2
’ there are several surgical techniques to correct snoring , although these are not usually available on the @entity244			2
however , these are only effective on a specific cause of snoring – when the problem lies with the soft tissues at the back of the mouth			2
one option is for surgeons to use a blade or laser to trim away the uvula – the piece of tissue that hangs from the roof of the mouth			0
the laser option is thought to be less risky in terms of bleeding and post-operative infection , although there is evidence that it is less effective .			0
