scientists have announced that they might have found water clouds beyond the solar system for the first time			1
the discovery was made on a brown dwarf , a gas giant planet that failed to become a star , 7.3 light - years from @entity8			1
if true , the sighting would be an important step to finding habitable planets like our own in the future			0
the discovery was made on a ' failed star ' ( artist 's impression shown ) 7.3 light - years from @entity8			1
the object is a brown dwarf called @entity26 - 0714 that is up to 10 times the mass of @entity27 a brown dwarf is commonly regarded as the ‘ missing link ’ between stars and planets			1
they are too large to be classed as true planets , but too small to have ignited nuclear fusion at their cores and be classed as stars			0
when a celestial body first forms , its size will determine what sort of object it becomes			0
as a star forms from a cloud of gas , its core becomes so large that hydrogen fuses into helium conversely , a planet forms into a smaller sphere that is not large enough to have nuclear fusion at its core			0
brown dwarfs fall somewhere in between			0
they are the size between a gas giant like @entity27 and a small star			2
their mass , meanwhile , can be anything from 15 to 75 times the mass of @entity27			2
this is not enough to sustain fusion but , owing to their size , this has led astronomers to coin brown dwarfs ‘ failed stars ’			2
as they do not emit much light , it ’s thought there may be many rogue brown dwarfs drifting through the galaxy waiting to be discovered			2
the finding was announced by a team led by dr @entity79 of the @entity80 in @entity17 the object in question is the coldest brown dwarf ever found , @entity26 - 0714 , with a temperature between -48 and -13 ° @entity85 )			1
to make the discovery , dr @entity79 combined 151 near - infrared images of the world using the 6.5 - metre ( 21 feet ) @entity91 telescope in @entity92			2
this revealed that the colour of the gas giant matches the predicted models of a brown dwarf with clouds of water ice in its atmosphere			1
while water vapour has been spotted in exoplanets before , this is the first time water clouds have been spotted			2
it ’s thought that as much as half of the planet is obscured by clouds , making it a partly cloudy world like @entity8			1
even in our own solar system , the only water clouds known of are on @entity8 and @entity114 ; for the giant planets like @entity27 and @entity116 , they are too cold and ammonia ice clouds cover suspected water clouds below			1
and finding a partly cloudy world is important , as aside from @entity8 most other planets with clouds we know of such as @entity121 and @entity27 are blanketed in clouds , with no apparent break to the surface			1
@entity124 is one of the closest ' stars ' to @entity8 at just 7.3 light - years away			1
the year when each system was determined is listed in brackets under each object			0
@entity124 is also the coldest brown dwarf ever found , with a temperature between -48 and -13 ° c ( -55 and 8 ° f ) ‘ i 've been obsessed with this object since its discovery , ’ dr @entity79 said in @entity133			1
‘ i went to battle at the telescope to try and get this detection			0
‘ i wanted to put war paint under my eyes and wear a bandanna , because i knew this was not going to be an easy thing to do			0
‘ at the telescope , i 've never been so nervous			0
i 've never wanted clear conditions so badly			0
’ ultimately , after three nights of observations , dr @entity79 made the groundbreaking discovery			0
follow - up studies from observatories like the @entity149 , set to launch in 2018 , will be used to confirm the findings .			0

astronomers in @entity17 have found the first ever evidence for water clouds beyond the solar system
the discovery was made on a ' failed star ' 7.3 light - years from @entity8
the object is a brown dwarf called @entity26 - 0714 that is up to 10 times the mass of @entity27
it is also the first discovery of a ' partly cloudy ' world like @entity8
and it could help to find more @entity8 - like worlds in the future
