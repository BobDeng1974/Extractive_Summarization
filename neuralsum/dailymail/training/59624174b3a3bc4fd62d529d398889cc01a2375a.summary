@entity0 know they may never have a better chance of beating @entity2 on the @entity4 ' own turf as the old enemies prepare to lock horns in @entity7 on sunday			1
home coach @entity8 accepts all the pressure is on his injury - decimated @entity2 side after their first defeat in four years left them vulnerable to an early exit from the 2014 @entity15			1
that unexpected result against @entity17 in @entity18 has had the statisticians poring through the record books this week			1
@entity0 are confident they can cause an upset against an @entity2 side that lost to @entity17 it is 60 years since @entity2 last failed to reach the final of a major tournament - @entity25 beat @entity27 in the climax to the inaugural @entity29 in 1954			1
but @entity8 ' men will miss out on a trip to @entity32 on november 15 if the @entity33 avoid a shock defeat to outsiders @entity36 in @entity37 on saturday and 24 hours later the @entity38 suffer their first back - to - back losses at home since their last @entity42 defeat in 1970			2
both teams will be wearing special jerseys to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the famous @entity46 in @entity47 , which was won by an @entity0 team reduced to nine men at times because of injury , and survivors from the last @entity53 team to win in @entity7 have been queuing up to talk up the chances of @entity56 's team emulating their feat from 22 years ago			1
current scrum - half @entity58 , who made his test debut in @entity0 's opening 32 - 26 win over @entity36 last saturday , says the confidence of the class of 1992 is not misplaced			1
@entity58 ( left ) says @entity56 's side are ready to face the @entity65 with a win under their belt ' it 's a pretty young squad , ' @entity58 said			1
' there 's not much fear there			2
i think we 've all done really well with our clubs this year and we 've been picked on merit so we 're confident			0
we 've trained really well and we 're going into it with a win under our belts as well			0
' we 're looking forward to sunday			0
it 's looking really good			0
there 's no bigger opportunity to beat the @entity38 in their own backyard			2
it 's going to be a great day and hopefully we can perform and do everyone proud			0
' @entity0 are waiting on the fitness of newly - appointed captain @entity87 , who was in the @entity25 team that won in @entity47 in 2006 , while @entity2 , already shorn of a dozen established internationals , still have a question mark over half - back @entity91 , and @entity8 himself has been quarantined after coming down with flu - like symptoms			1
@entity2 are waiting on the fitness of @entity91 , and are already missing a dozen top players if @entity56 can restore the inspirational @entity87 to an already impressive - looking pack , it will significantly improve their chances of reaching a third @entity15 final , their first in the southern hemisphere			1
without a warm - up match , @entity0 were always going to improve from their opening fixture , regardless of the result , and @entity58 is confident there is much more to come , both from the team as a whole and from his new half - back partnership with @entity109 , who will be back on familiar territory after starting his professional career at @entity112			1
' @entity113 is a great player , ' @entity58 said			2
' i 've watched him for a few years now			0
he 's my roomy on tour and i think it was a great move by the coaching staff to put me in with him			0
@entity0 could be boosted by the return of new captain @entity87 , who may be fit enough for sunday ' you get to know each other a little bit and i 've been spending a lot of time with @entity113 , drinking a few coffees and hanging around with him			2
that all helps when you go into the games to get a good partnership going			0
' it 's pretty new for me obviously being in this environment			0
i 'm enjoying playing with him and hopefully we can have a good last couple of sessions and go into @entity2 really confident that we can do a job			2
' it was nerve - wracking for me putting on an @entity0 shirt for the first time but it was great to get off to a winning start			0
i thought as a team we probably could have played a bit better but we got the job done , we got the two points , and we 'll be better this week against a tough @entity38 side			0

@entity0 will reach first @entity15 final in @entity151 hemisphere with win
@entity58 says ' there 's not much fear ' against vulnerable @entity4
@entity0 beat @entity36 in first game while @entity2 lost to @entity17
