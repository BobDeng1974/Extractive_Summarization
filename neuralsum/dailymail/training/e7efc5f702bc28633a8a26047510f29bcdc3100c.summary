@entity0 , 56 , was horrified to find the metal iron @entity2 piece when she took a bit of coleslaw a grandmother - of - one was horrified to find a metal @entity2 piece in her @entity10 's coleslaw			1
@entity0 , 56 , from @entity11 in @entity12 , was tucking into her ' taste the @entity14 ' pot when she bit down on something hard and was astonished to find the mini iron			1
the mother - of - three called the supermarket and was told to throw away the coleslaw , wash out the pot and bring the container and iron back to the store so it could be analysed			1
mrs @entity0 opened the coleslaw at the weekend and was finishing it off on monday with salmon , a scotch egg and a tomato			1
@entity28 , the company which makes the board game , replaced the iron playing piece with a cat following a poll in 2013 and it is no longer produced			1
she said : ' i just could not believe it when i saw the iron			2
they do n't even sell @entity2 at the store i bought it in			0
' how on earth did it get there ? it makes me think that someone took it out of their pocket and just put it in there			0
' and if they did are they going through the whole set ? it 's really worrying			2
i think it has been done out of spite , i ca n't understand how it could have been a mistake			0
' the retired customer service worker , who is married to @entity57 , 60 , said she emailed @entity10 's but got no response so then phoned the head office			1
she added : ' i feel that no - one is taking me seriously , i have only spoken to someone because i had to chase them up			0
' i was n't really sure what to say when he said wash the pot out and bring it back with the iron , so i agreed , but i 'm not doing that at the moment			1
' i have also emailed @entity68 , but i have n't heard anything back yet			2
i 'm going to wait to speak to them before i decide what to do			0
she was advised by @entity10 's to wash out the pot and take it back to the store along with the mini iron ( right ) but she has so far decided to keep hold of it in fear that the supermarket is trying to get rid of evidence toy maker @entity28 replaced the iron token with a cat following a poll in 2013 and it is no longer produced ' it 's still wrapped in clingfilm and sat in my fridge at the moment			1
it feels like they 're asking me to get rid of the evidence			1
' they said they will analyse it , but what will there be to analyse if there 's no coleslaw in it ? ' i felt quite sick after biting into it , @entity98 knows where it has been , wrapped up in a snotty tissue in someone 's pocket ? i could have choked or it could have been a young child			1
' mrs @entity0 has a two - year - old granddaughter called @entity107 but insists she would not have put the toy in the food as she does n't even own a @entity2 set			1
she said : ' i am sure it came from the coleslaw			2
there was about two inches at the bottom and i used to a soup spoon so put it onto my plate			0
' it definitely came for the coleslaw			2
i do n't even own a @entity2 set , neither does my daughter			0
' @entity122 would n't have been messing around with it , none of us in the family have the game so she would have no way of even having the iron			1
' a @entity10 's spokesperson said : ' food safety is our top priority and we take very rare cases such as this extremely seriously			1
' we need the container to identify the exact product and supplier , so that we can conduct a proper investigation			0
' we 've asked @entity0 to return it to her nearest store so we can look into this properly , and we 'll keep her updated			1
' the local environmental health department has confirmed it is investigating the incident			0
the cat fended off competition from a robot , diamond ring , helicopter and guitar to become the new token in 2013 @entity150 maker @entity28 asked millions of @entity2 fans to vote on which of its eight tokens to get rid off and what it should be replaced by			2
the iron , which featured in the game since its creation in 1935 , secured just 8 per cent of a vote and was retired			1
