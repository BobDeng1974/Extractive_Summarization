by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 15:48 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 17:22 est , 18 september 2013 former secretary of state @entity2 has testified multiple times in congressional hearings about @entity5 , but as a presidential run looms , republicans are sharpening their knives for more @entity10 visits @entity11 are mulling whether to demand former secretary of state @entity2 's return to @entity10 to face more tough questions about her agency 's failure to protect diplomats and security staff in @entity5 , @entity18 a year ago			1
an aide to a high - ranking @entity21 member of the @entity22 committee told @entity23 that the committee 's chairman , @entity26 rep. @entity24 , ' is dead serious ' about raking the likely 2016 presidential candidate over the coals in the future			1
' look , it 's not like we 're getting great answers from the deputies and under secretaries , ' the staffer said on wednesday			2
' so eventually you have to climb the ladder and swear @entity2 in again			1
' ' i 'm not saying " the fish stinks from the head , " or anything like that , ' the aide cautioned			0
' just that the committee leaders on our side want answers and they 're not going to let up			0
' @entity24 told the @entity48 on wednesday morning that his committee wo n't hesitate to bring back any of the senior - level witnesses who have already testified about the september 11 , 2012 terror attack on @entity53 diplomatic facilities in the eastern @entity18 port city			1
' we can certainly have mrs. @entity2 back , ' @entity24 told @entity48			1
' we want to be respectful of her time , so getting to the facts – including people below her – first is critical			0
' an oversight committee spokesperson declined to comment on the record about how likely it was that @entity24 could actually call @entity2 as a witness again			1
but as the 2016 presidential election draws nearer , the knives may come out in earnest			1
embarrassing her as the presidential campaign season gets underway could be a devastating political chess move , but it 's unclear how long @entity11 will wait to pull the trigger if they decide to recall her as a witness			2
@entity21 sen. @entity91 , another likely presidential contender , has already said that mishandling of @entity5 under @entity2 's @entity94 leadership ' should preclude her from holding higher office			1
' @entity91 said in august that he was n't certain ' @entity2 [ was ] telling the truth ' about the nature of the @entity73 annex that also came under attack			1
he said he suspects it was involved with providing arms to @entity104 rebels fighting the dictator @entity105			0
' the @entity106 has also said the @entity73 has been involved with procuring arms to the @entity109 rebels in @entity104 for over a year			2
what was the @entity73 annex doing there ? ' he said in august , referring to the @entity5 complex			2
' i have asked specifically to have her brought back and i hope chairman @entity24 will bring her back			1
she needs to testify under oat			0
did she know about this and did it have anything to do with the misdirection campaign ? and did she have anything to do with not allowing the @entity122 to go aid their wounded brothers there in @entity5 ? ' if she were to come back to face more questions , a @entity10 staffer explained , @entity11 would likely steer clear of @entity104 links and focus instead on any involvement @entity2 had in approving the security arrangements for embassies and consulates in some of the world 's most dangerous places			1
protesters gathered outside the @entity135 on sept. 10 as @entity2 received the @entity136 , given annually to an individual who ' displays courage and conviction while striving to secure liberty for people worldwide ' republicans may relish the possibility of firing more tough questions at @entity2 as she readies for a @entity148 run , but such a strategy could backfire on the @entity21 and create powerful sound bites for democrats republicans would also likely grill her about precisely when she learned what the @entity53 intelligence community knew almost instantly – that terrorists , not @entity109 protesters , set fires and fired mortars into the @entity5 compound and a nearby @entity73 annex			1
lastly , @entity11 want to know whether @entity2 had a personal hand in rewriting a series of @entity73 talking points that her agency softened significantly in the early , foggy @entity164 days			1
republicans , including @entity24 , have been intensely critical of @entity2 , even before she began exploring a @entity148 run , for what they perceive as her role in a cover - up during the weeks between the @entity5 attack and @entity173 's 2012 presidential re-election			1
@entity53 ambassador to @entity18 @entity175 was killed during the @entity5 attack , along with three other @entity53 personnel the intelligence community initially rendered a frank assessment that @entity5 was attacked by jihadi groups including the militant , @entity70 - linked @entity18 organization @entity182			1
but after @entity94 - led massaging , it became a weaker series of statements that protected the @entity173 administration while the president was campaigning for re-election by claiming that ' @entity70 is on the run			0
' then - @entity192 ambassador @entity191 claimed days later in five broadcast interviews that the attack was the result of a spontaneous protest following the online publication of a crude @entity53 - made @entity199 video that mocked the @entity109 prophet @entity200			0
@entity173 later promoted @entity201 to the position of national security adviser			0
@entity2 famously appeared in a @entity205 hearing on january 23 , sparring with @entity207 @entity21 sen. @entity206 about the @entity94 's evolving storyline as the dust settled on the terror attack			1
' with all due respect , the fact is we had four dead @entity53 , ' @entity2 lectured			2
' was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night decided to go kill some @entity53 ? ' ' what difference at this point does it make ? ' she asked			0
' it is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again			0
' on wednesday the @entity148 foreign affairs @entity226 heard from @entity94 under secretary for management @entity228 , who approved a plan in december 2011 to outfit the @entity5 post with what turned out to be inadequate and substandard security protection			1
after the attack , a formal review determined that no senior @entity94 officials were responsible			0
' turmoil , ' not ' terror ' : news broadcasters followed @entity191 's lead on sept. 16 , 2012 as she said during five separate interviews that the @entity5 attack was the product of a protest gone bad -- despite intelligence that showed otherwise from the beginning under secretary @entity228 ( @entity81 ) faced aggressive questioning wednesday from rep. @entity248 ( r ) over the @entity94 's failure to fire anyone following the terror attack in @entity18 the final report , issued by an @entity253 , also found @entity228 blameless , despite his signature on the ' action plan ' that formalized the level of armed security details present in @entity5			1
@entity258 chair @entity248 , a @entity26 @entity21 , asked @entity228 during wednesday 's hearing to explain why no @entity94 employees had been terminated after terrorists killed @entity53 ambassador @entity175 and three other @entity53 personnel			2
' no @entity94 personnel have been fired or even disciplined , ' @entity248 barked			0
' no one has missed a paycheck			0
' @entity267 @entity21 rep. @entity266 later suggested that the @entity94 is engaging in a slow - roll cover - up by ' merely shuffl [ ing ] the deck chairs			0
' @entity94 spokeswoman @entity271 parried reporters ' challenges on tuesday , insisting that she would not address ' internal deliberations ' related to the @entity5 diplomatic station			0
@entity228 said that four @entity94 officials , none of them at senior levels , were placed on administrative leave three months after the attack , and were since moved into positions that do n't afford them ' worldwide decision - making authority for security			2
' ' accountability includes being relieved of your job and assigned to other positions , ' @entity228 insisted			0
' to me , that is serious accountability			0
' ' reassignment just does n’t cut it , ' @entity248 retorted			0
then - @entity2 and president @entity173 both said early on that a protest -- not a terror attack -- was the root cause of the deaths and destruction in @entity18 devastation : the mortar , small - arms and firebomb attack left @entity53 's diplomatic station in ruins secretary of state @entity305 made news in august when he reinstated all four of those employees , following an internal determination that ' no employee breached their duty or should be fired ' as a consequence of the @entity5 attack			1
@entity228 also said that one reason @entity53 law enforcement has yet to make arrests in the @entity5 case is that the @entity18 government has n't permitted it			2
' yes , they will let journalists in , but they are not letting @entity53 law enforcement in to arrest people there , ' @entity228 conceded , ' because the government of @entity18 is not in control to that degree			0
' the under secretary has testified previously that he was not involved with day - to - day decisions related to the @entity94 's @entity5 compound			1
while the @entity253 interviewed him at length , it allegedly never spoke with then - @entity2			0
before wednesday 's hearing , @entity21 oversight committee staff finalized a report alleging that the @entity253 specifically aimed to protect political appointees at @entity336 while assigning responsibility for the terror - attack debacle to lower - level career civil servants			1
secretary of state @entity305 determined in august that all four employees who were placed on probation after the @entity5 attack could return to full - time duties in different jobs on thursday , @entity253 co-chairs admiral @entity345 and @entity346 , a former diplomat , will testify before @entity347			2
@entity348 , a former @entity349 director , will also testify			0
he headed an independent security panel that the @entity253 asked to examine how some of @entity53 's most vulnerable overseas posts have been left with inadequate protection			0
the @entity355 panel will hear testimony later in the day covering the @entity53 military 's level of preparedness to respond if @entity5 - style terror attacks become the norm in the future .			2

a @entity21 aide says @entity148 investigators may ' have to climb the ladder and swear @entity2 in ' since *underlings* are n't providing answers
' we can certainly have mrs. @entity2 back , ' @entity148 oversight chairman @entity24 said wednesday
as 2016 presidential race draws closer , the @entity21 will look for ways to embarrass their likely @entity80 rival for the @entity148
sen. @entity91 , another possible presidential hopeful , has said @entity2 's @entity5 *performance* ' should preclude her from holding higher office '
@entity11 want to grill the former secretary of state on the editing of @entity73 talking points following the attack , and about who decided on the level of security the @entity18 facility should have
