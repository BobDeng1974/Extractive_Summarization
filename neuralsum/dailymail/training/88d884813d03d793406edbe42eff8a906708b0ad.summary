taking a painkiller can numb emotional pain , say experts paracetamol could be used to help treat emotional pain and anxiety , according to a new @entity7 study			1
it found that the common painkiller could help alleviate the symptoms of existential dread - the anxiety that arises from uncertainty surrounding the meaning of life and death			1
the researchers knew from previous research that both physical and social pain - such as bumping your head or falling out with friends - can be alleviated with paracetamol			1
lead researcher @entity24 from the @entity25 said : ‘ pain extends beyond tissue damage and hurt feelings , and includes the distress and existential angst we feel when we 're uncertain or have just experienced something surreal			2
' regardless of the kind of pain , taking [ paracetamol ] seems to inhibit the brain signal that says something is wrong			1
’ he and his colleagues speculated that the uneasiness we feel when faced with thoughts of death might involve similar brain processes			1
they wondered whether it would it be possible to numb that type of suffering with a simple pain medicine , too			0
the study involved 120 university students who were divided into two groups			0
one group was given a 1000mg pill of @entity53 , an @entity54 brand of paracetamol , and the other was given a placebo sugar pill			1
some from both groups were asked to write about dental pain while the rest were asked to write about what would happen to them after they died			0
all participants were then asked to read about the arrest of a prostitute			0
participants were asked to set an amount for bail , ranging from nothing to £ 325 , for the hypothetical prostitute			0
the humble paracetamol was shown to alleviate symptoms of anxiety as expected , the control group who wrote about dental pain - who felt no existential anxiety - gave relatively low bail amounts of around £ 195			1
however , those who wrote about their own death and took no paracetamol , gave the highest amounts , suggesting a fee of around £ 260			2
the second part of the study required watching a surrealist video by director @entity89 and then a video of rioters			0
researchers found that people who took paracetamol were less judgmental about the behaviour of the rioters			2
the study demonstrated that existentialist dread is not limited to thinking about death , but can be experienced in any situation which is unpredictable or surprising			0
' we ’re still taken aback that we ’ve found that a drug used primarily to alleviate headaches can also make people numb to the worry of thinking about their deaths , or to the uneasiness of watching a surrealist film , ' said @entity24			1
the researchers believe that these studies may have implications for new treatments in the future			0
' for people who suffer with chronic anxiety , or are overly sensitive to uncertainty , this work may shed some light on what is happening and how their symptoms could be reduced , ' concluded @entity24 .			2

@entity53 , an @entity54 brand of paracetamol , was found to reduce emotional pain of worry surrounding death
experts believe similar *therapies* could be used to help alleviate symptoms of anxiety in the future
