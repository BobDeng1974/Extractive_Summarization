they then called the police and allegedly claimed mr @entity0 was being ' physically threatening '			1
but it was only when police compared his photo from security cameras with the meat thief that they spotted the blunder			1
mr @entity0 today said : ' i feel appalled at how i was treated			1
i was just wandering through the shop - it 's very close to my house			2
a security guard came up to me and said could he have have a word with me			2
' he showed me a still of myself and said is this you ? he said to come to the back of the shop and we 'll talk about it			2
' they said i had stolen food from the shop			2
i said i had no idea what they were talking about			2
they had an array of stills with them but they only showed me two of myself taken on a different date			2
' they had these stills of the criminal with different coloured hair and at least fifteen years younger			0
the only similarity is that we 're both male , white and slim			0
what on earth were they doing putting photographs of me and mixing them up with photographs of a criminal ? ' he added : ' they did n't even have the decency to take me somewhere private			0
they said i would have time to look at the photographs later			0
they were very threatening and very rude			0
' the first thing the policeman said was " why did you tell me this is an emergency ? he is n't physically threatening "			0
' the police said i could have an interview there and then but i said i was n't prepared to say anything until a solicitor was there			2
' i was handcuffed and marched through the shop in front of everyone , in front of my neighbours			1
i was made to get into the police van on @entity113			1
' i was put into the back of the police van with the grille , all my belongings taken			1
and then they took a mug shot			0
' mr @entity0 says he shopped in the @entity34 branch of @entity1 for over 12 years and is also claiming back all of the money he claims he has spent at the store mr @entity0 's partner , who is a @entity125 lawyer then turned up at the police station where he was told he had been identified as a shoplifter			1
he explained : ' i was really shocked , i actually burst into tears when i spoke to the duty solicitor			0
' she said that the police told her they had incontrovertible evidence that i committed this crime			2
she was saying that it would be better to admit to the crime			0
i thought i was having some kind of memory lapse			0
i thought i was bonkers			0
' but he added he was only let go when officers re-examined the photos of him and the thief and realised they had the wrong man and said : ' the police did n't look carefully enough at the photographs			2
it clearly was n't me			0
' she apologised afterwards after it and said that she had never seen anything like this			0
' the writ is composed of three main parts , defamation , false imprisonment , and basically an abuse of trust			1
' i 'm an @entity21 graduate , i 'm in a very fortunate position			0
just imagine what could have happened to a person without these sorts of advantages			0
' i 'm just determined this does n't happen to someone else			0
i want @entity1 to change the way they operate			1
' a spokeswoman for @entity1 said : ' as this is part of ongoing legal proceedings , it would be inappropriate for @entity1 to provide any comment at this time			1
' a @entity171 spokesman confirmed they were called to the shop on may 19 after staff reported they had found believed responsible for thefts on may 2			0
