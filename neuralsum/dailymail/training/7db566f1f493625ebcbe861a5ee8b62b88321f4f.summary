one major trend emerged from monday 's transfer deadline day — the growing importance of the loan			1
nearly half of all deals in a final 24 hours of trading were loans rather than permanent transfers — @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 among them			1
over the weekend , @entity16 ’s £ 50million striker @entity15 completed an unprecedented two - year loan to @entity18			1
once the domain of lower league clubs from who could n’t rub two ha’pennies together , being involved in a loan deal is now the ultimate status symbol of the super-rich			1
nobody has embraced the fashion for loans more than @entity40 , who has allowed two entire teams of @entity16 players to be ‘ borrowed ’ by other clubs , usually with a fee involved			1
it ’s become an important new revenue stream for the @entity16 , who signed goalkeeper @entity48 at 19 and promptly let him go to @entity49 for three seasons while retaining his registration			1
that only tells half the story though			2
@entity55 financial fair play restrictions and escalating transfer fees mean even the biggest revenue earners like @entity30 have to keep a close eye on spending if they do n’t want to fall foul of the new rules			2
short - term fix : @entity15 gives the thumbs up as he joined @entity18 on a two - year loan video i needed a new adventure - @entity15 new boy : @entity15 watches @entity18 take on @entity68 after signing a two - year loan deal at the @entity70 hence on monday they became one of many big clubs to embrace the loan , agreeing to pay a £ 6m fee plus mega-wages to take @entity9 from @entity77 for a year			1
not to be outdone , @entity28 agreed to take @entity10 from @entity78 in similar circumstances			0
@entity30 ’s decision to sign @entity9 initially for just a year makes sense			0
having splashed out £ 200m in the last 12 months on @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 , another £ 50m on @entity9 was considered excessive at @entity78			0
yet @entity87 wanted the player and @entity77 knew the @entity89 was fed up playing in front of minuscule crowds in the south of @entity93			0
back again : @entity11 returned to the @entity94 with @entity95 from @entity96 on loan to all concerned , a loan was the perfect answer			2
@entity30 have got a world - class player for a relatively low fee and @entity77 ’s own @entity103 concerns are eased by getting the @entity89 ’s estimated £ 300,000 - a - week wages off their books			2
@entity103 was once derided as impossible to enforce			0
in fact , it ’s had a major impact			0
@entity108 and @entity109 will play with reduced squads in the @entity111 this season for breaking @entity103 rules			0
another offence and @entity55 may kick them out of next year ’s competition			0
other clubs have taken note			0
to avoid sanction for over-spending , clubs , agents and players have found their short - term fix			1
it ’s called a loan .			2

the growing importance of the loan was *evident* on monday
nearly half of the deadline day deals were short - term
nobody has embraced the fashion for loans more than @entity16
