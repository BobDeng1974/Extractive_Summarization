it 's that time of the season when @entity3 footballers cast their vote for the @entity5 ’ @entity6			1
last year ’s winner @entity7 now resides in @entity8 , so , too , does 2013 victor @entity9			1
it means we ’re almost certain to see a new name on the trophy come may			2
here , @entity14 runs you through the six leading contenders … name : @entity18 club : @entity20 age : 21 stats : apps 44 , goals 29 striker @entity18 has hit an astonishing 29 goals in 44 games for @entity20 so far this season @entity18 ( second right ) has twice been named @entity27 during his breakthrough campaign @entity18 ( left ) broke into the @entity30 squad and scored 79 seconds into his debut against @entity32 reasons he deserves it : very few would have predicted @entity18 would plunder an incredible 29 goals by early april in what is essentially his breakthrough season			1
his has been the name on everyone ’s lips since the turn of the year and last month ’s @entity30 call - up was thoroughly deserved			2
in an age where diving , spitting , lying and cheating too often dominate our news agenda , @entity18 ’s goal - laden arrival has been a joy to witness			1
reasons he does n’t : are there any ? you could argue it took him until november to score two @entity3 goals but that was as much to do with a lack of opportunities			1
previous ( individual ) @entity3 honours : @entity27 ( 2 ) name : @entity61 club : @entity63 age : 24 stats : apps 44 , goals 17 @entity61 has been @entity63 's outstanding performer , scoring 17 times in 44 games hazard ( left ) has been a menace to opponents all season with his trickery and high workrate hazard ( centre ) is the odds - on favourite to be named @entity80 reasons he deserves it : he ’s running back into form at just the right time and his goals look like they ’ll edge @entity63 towards the title			1
hazard , under the instruction of @entity89 , has married graft to his craft and has been his side ’s outstanding player this season			2
the fact he works so hard in addition to his creativity is sure to earn the respect of fellow pros and it ’s no surprise he is the odds - on favourite for the prize			2
reasons he does n’t : like @entity18 , it is hard to make an argument against a player who has performed at such a high level on a consistent basis			1
it did , however , take the @entity113 a little while to find his scoring stride and he netted just once in the opening nine matches of the campaign			2
previous honours : @entity120 2014 , @entity121 2013 & 2014 name : @entity123 club : @entity63 age : 26 stats : apps 30 , goals 18 reasons he deserves it : his immediate impact was sensational , smashing seven goals in his first four outings			0
his presence as the spearhead of @entity63 ’s attack has turned them into title winners and he is n’t afraid to put in a shift either			0
@entity123 has spearheaded @entity63 's attack this season , with 18 goals in 30 appearances @entity123 ( right ) fires in the winner for @entity63 in their 2 - 1 victory over @entity147 at @entity148 @entity123 's bid to become @entity6 could be hampered by the games he has missed through injury reasons he does n’t : he ’s missed too many games because of injury , as well as suspension , and is too often on our back pages for the wrong reasons			0
it is that edge which will probably dissuade fellow pros from voting for the @entity161			2
previous honours : @entity27 ( 1 ) name : @entity164 club : @entity166 age : 26 stats : apps 31 , goals 23 reasons he deserves it : without his goals @entity166 ’s title challenge would have faded long ago			1
it has been a poor season at the @entity177			0
@entity164 , though , has managed to mask those shortcomings with his brilliance			1
his four goals against @entity20 and match - winning treble versus @entity183 are among the best individual performances of the season			0
meanwhile , he was so devastating during his two - goal show at @entity187 that the home crowd rose to applaud the @entity189 when he made way late on			0
@entity164 has again been in prolific scoring form for @entity166 , blasting 23 goals in 31 matches @entity164 ( right ) has struggled with fitness and has only managed to score three times in the league in 2015 reasons he does n’t : if @entity164 managed to avoid what are all - too - frequent visits to the treatment room then @entity166 might be pushing @entity63 harder for the league title			1
he only has three league goals in 2015 and , while his numbers remain impressive , that lack of consistency will cost him votes			0
previous honours : @entity27 ( 2 ) name : @entity208 club : @entity210 age : 24 stats : apps 37 , clean sheets 13 @entity208 ( left ) has been outstanding for @entity210 with 13 clean sheets this season @entity216 shone for @entity210 in the early part of the @entity3 campaign when @entity210 struggled for form @entity216 's displays have been integral to @entity210 's top - four charge and he has been their best player reasons he deserves it : only @entity216 was spared criticism as @entity210 struggled to find their rhythm during the early part of the season			1
indeed , there was an argument that , without his points - saving heroics , @entity230 might have come under pressure far sooner			0
he has matured into the goalkeeper sir @entity235 thought he would and it is little wonder he is now being courted by the likes of @entity239			0
reasons he does n’t : only the goalkeeper in a title - winning side would land the @entity5 prize , you feel			2
for while @entity216 has been @entity210 ’s best player , he has not single - handedly done enough to turn them into challengers for the @entity3 crown			1
previous honours : @entity121 2013 name : @entity251 club : @entity253 age : 26 stats : apps 43 , goals 20 @entity251 hit the ground running at @entity253 following his @entity260 switch , with 20 goals in 43 games @entity251 hit 14 goals in 18 appearances during his most relentless scoring period this season @entity266 international @entity251 has added greater aggression to @entity253 's attacking line with his arrival reasons he deserves it : there was a suspicion it would take the @entity266 time to settle in the @entity3			1
well , he did n’t score in his first four matches but then embarked on a run which yielded 14 in 18			0
his energy , aggression and will to win – coupled with bags of quality – has made all to the difference to an @entity253 side previously lacking in such vigour			0
reasons he does n’t : his goals have dried up since january and his awesome autumn could well be forgotten by the time votes are cast			0
however , he is still a certainty for @entity253 ’s individual annual honours			0
previous honours : @entity27 ( 1 ) name : @entity292 club : @entity147 age : 24 stats : apps 45 , goals 7 reasons he deserves it : he has emerged as @entity147 ’s future captain having taken on responsibility in the centre of the park			0
@entity292 barely misses a minute and is now a certain starter for his country – not bad for a player who sir @entity235 said could not run properly			0
he ’s also added goals to his game and is a real pro ’s pro – it would be no surprise to see him land his fair share of the votes			0
@entity292 ( centre ) has continued his development into an essential player for @entity147 this season @entity292 emerged as @entity147 's future captain with @entity320 ( right ) leaving at the end of the season @entity292 has added more goals to his game and has been ever present throughout @entity147 's campaign reasons he does n’t : it has n’t been a vintage year for @entity147 and their bid for @entity329 football looks set to end in failure			2
as good as @entity292 has been , this will almost certainly cost him the top prize			2
previous honours : none verdict : if the bookies are to be believed then the award will be going to last season ’s @entity120 , @entity61			1
however , do n’t underestimate the amount of goodwill there is towards @entity18 within the game and he could well clean up with both the young and senior prizes			1
and that @entity344 tale would be a victory for everything we love about the game			0
@entity18 certainly gets my vote !			1
