most likely to return home to the @entity1 from bases in @entity3 by @entity4 last updated at 9:02 pm on 4th january 2012 the @entity1 is planning to drastically reduce the number of soldiers that it keeps based in @entity8			1
the move , to be announced tomorrow by defence secretary @entity10 , is part of a massive cost - cutting review			2
the number of brigade combat teams , each consisting of between 3,000 and 4,000 troops , will be slashed from three to two			2
the soldiers going home are likely to be from one of the two infantry brigades in @entity3			1
' deeply involved ' : @entity21 has instructed defence secretary @entity10 to cut military costs by reducing the number of troops in @entity8 the decision continues a @entity1 drawdown from the continent that has seen a force of 300,000 during the @entity29 fall to fewer than 80,000 today			1
mr @entity10 is also expected to say the @entity1 is abandoning its strategy of maintaining a force that can fight and win two wars at the same time			1
instead , @entity1 will aim to triumph in one war while being able to meet and ‘ spoil ’ any aggressive actions by a second adversary			1
the eight - month review was ordered by president @entity21 , who wants the @entity37 to slice up to $ 470 billion from the @entity37 budget over the next 12 years			0
mr @entity21 was said to have been ‘ deeply involved ’ in the review process			0
the pullout of @entity1 troops from @entity8 was first suggested by @entity44 ’s defence secretary @entity43 , but it was put on hold because of the demands placed on the military by the wars in @entity49 and @entity50			2
the spending reductions , while not yet set in stone , are expected to trim the number of military and civilian defense personnel , delay or cut back on some high - profile weapons systems like the radar - evading @entity57 and take steps to control spiraling health - care costs			0
a senior defense official said mr @entity10 would unveil some details affecting major weapons programs but added that he did not expect the kind of ‘ bloodbath ’ another former defence secretary @entity66 announced in april 2009 , when he killed or cut back on many weapons systems			0
major defense contractors like @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 have been anxiously awaiting news about any major programme cuts in the new budget			0
slowdowns are expected in several new weapons programs , including two - year delays in work on a replacement for the @entity80 and on a second new @entity82 - class aircraft carrier			0
in an effort to get control of the government 's huge deficits , @entity21 and @entity83 agreed last year on a budget deal that could cut projected defense spending by more than $ 937 billion over the next decade			0
heading home : the @entity1 military presence in @entity8 is shrinking and it is thought that soldiers may be brought back from bases like @entity94 in @entity3			1
