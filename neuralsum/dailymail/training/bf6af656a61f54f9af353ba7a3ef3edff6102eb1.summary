a cancer patient has been told the ' wonder drug ' that doctors claim extended his life is too expensive for the @entity4 to fund			1
@entity5 , of @entity6 , @entity7 , took part in clinical trials of @entity10 to treat his prostate cancer			1
but the 58 - year - old has been left devastated by a decision this week by the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) not to fund the drug for patients who , like him , have not undergone chemotherapy			1
mr @entity5 was given three years to live after being diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer last april			1
the drug is currently available on the @entity4 to men who have already gone through chemotherapy			1
but @entity14 has ruled that the ' wonder ' medication is too expensive to give to men before they have undergone the much more gruelling cancer treatment			1
mr @entity5 , of @entity6 , @entity7 , said : ' under normal circumstances they give people @entity10 when they are in the very advanced stages and everything else has failed			1
abiraterone , pictured , is currently available on the @entity4 to men who have already gone through chemotherapy ' @entity14 's decision is a very bad one			1
i can empirically show what the drug has done for me			0
' it 's just wonderful			0
before i got on it , people were calling it the wonder drug and i have to say it 's pretty special			2
' mr @entity5 was being treated with @entity49 hormone injections , which resulted in hot sweats and fatigue , and had radiotherapy before the start of the clinical trial			1
he said : ' i had no symptoms , so when i was diagnosed , let 's say it was n't my best day			0
' i walked around in a fog for a week and so did my wife			0
but you get over it , readjust and get on with it			0
' i was on the hormone therapy injections and the side effects were not great , but take it on the chin and get on with it			0
' before being chosen for the trial , a blood test to measure the prostate - specific antigen found mr @entity5 ' count had rocketed to 500			1
the normal range is between five and six			0
he said : ' it was coming down nicely on the @entity49 , but since being on @entity10 , it dropped completely			0
one year on my count is so low it is undetectable			0
' i would say my three - year prognosis has gone flying out of the window			1
' my doctors are more cautious , but agree i will probably go past the dates they first thought			0
' it 's a no - brainer , it just works and personally i have had no side effects from it			0
' it should be given to men before they even have to go through chemotherapy			0
' from april 2013 to march 2014 , @entity10 pre-chemotherapy was the second most requested drug on @entity89 's @entity88			0
on sunday , june 29 , former health minister @entity90 urged the @entity91 to intervene in the @entity14 process and call off the proposed restriction on use of @entity10 before chemotherapy			2
@entity10 , also known as @entity10 , was used pre-chemotherapy by thousands of men last year through the @entity88 , which picks up the bill for patients in @entity89			1
above , prostate cancer cells @entity100 , chief executive of @entity102 @entity101 , has criticised the @entity14 decision			1
he said : ' it 's a fiasco			0
this decision is a kick in the teeth for men with advanced prostate cancer			2
' for many , this presented a vital opportunity for extra time with loved ones and a chance to delay chemotherapy and the debilitating side effects which come with it			0
' in the case of @entity10 , @entity14 said the drug was too costly to use at an earlier stage in the disease			1
when the drug is used after chemotherapy , different rules apply that take into account the end - of - life plight of patients which make the drug cost - effective			2
although the drug is sold to the @entity4 at the same price at whatever stage in the disease it is used , the cost effectiveness formula becomes more expensive before chemotherapy			2
the official price of a month ’s treatment is £ 3,000 but the @entity4 pays less through a discount scheme from the manufacturer			2
@entity14 chief executive sir @entity141 said : ' we know how important it is for patients to have the option to delay chemotherapy and its associated side effects , so we are disappointed not to be able to recommend abiraterone for use in this way			2
' however , the manufacturer 's own economic model demonstrated that the drug does not offer enough benefit to justify its price			2

@entity5 told @entity157 prostate drug is too costly for @entity4 to fund
58 - year - old says the treatment , taken in pre-chemo trial , extended his life
drug is given to men after chemo when they are running out of options
thousands of people could benefit from taking pill earlier , doctors claim
but rationing *watchdog* @entity14 says it will not *approve* such use on @entity4
