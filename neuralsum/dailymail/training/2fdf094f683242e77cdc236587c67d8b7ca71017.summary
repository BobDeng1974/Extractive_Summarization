heartless : @entity1 , @entity2 has created a furious reaction from families of those killed in the @entity7 massacre by creating a video game in which the player can reenact the shooting and also made a @entity12 game in 2007 the @entity1 man who sparked international fury after he developed a game in which players can reenact the @entity7 massacre in which 20 children were slaughtered was also behind a sick @entity12 simulation in 2007			1
@entity2 , caused a similar level of disgust when he built the game , @entity19 , which allowed players to re-create the mass campus shooting carried out by @entity24 which killed 32 students			1
that game caused anger worldwide too , and in an outrageous interview given at the time clearly designed to shock , @entity2 described himself as a ' heartless b * * * * * d ' , who was ' perfectly content laughing at the ( sic ) hypocracy of everyone and taking my title as troll of the year '			1
in the interview , published on video - game website @entity38 , a remorseless @entity39 , then aged 21 , admitted that he meant the game to be offensive ' so me and my friends and people like me and my friends could have a laugh			1
' showing a shocking lack of awareness towards the feelings of the families who lost loved ones that day in @entity51 , @entity2 claimed he enjoyed laughing at those upset at @entity19 , even appearing proud of that fact			1
defending the appalling timing of the game so soon after the massacre , @entity2 said that he did n't care if the families were not ready to see it , saying that ' i do n't see that as my need to wait for them to build up a tolerance to pain			1
' appearing to only want to get a reaction from his interviewer , @entity2 makes the galling claim that his video simulation of a mass murder is in fact art - claiming that attacking people online , or trolling , ' is an art in itself			1
' @entity19 is a controversial amateur action computer game that re-creates the 2007 @entity73 on the campus of @entity12 in @entity75 , @entity51 , @entity76			1
the game was created by @entity78 asked finally if he has anything to say to those who hated his game , @entity2 simply tells them to ' do a barrel roll '			2
this past week , @entity2 has attempted to defend his @entity7 game , entitled ' the slaying of @entity86 ' , to the mother of one of the victims			1
@entity2 , 27 , told @entity90 , whose daughter @entity91 , 27 , died shielding her students from @entity94 's bullets that the game was to highlight the importance of gun control			1
asking @entity2 on @entity98 why he had created the game , @entity90 was gifted withering answers , including one sarcastic reply in which he told her he would ' crib note ' the point , which was ' gun control '			2
@entity2 's game has caused an eruption of rage from the families of those involved in the massacre , who have said the game has caused them ' deep anger and fury '			1
police officers gather in front of @entity117 on the campus of @entity12 after a shooting left at least 32 dead april 16 , 2007 in @entity75 , @entity51 the simulation allows players to re-enact the terrible day of the shooting on december 15 last year where 20 children and six teaching staff were killed by a gunman in @entity126 , @entity127			1
the game , which has already been taken down by one website where it was posted , allows users to ' shoot mother ' , collect ammunition and move through the school firing weapons			0
six years after his @entity12 game , the @entity1 posted a justification on his website for the @entity7 simulation , claiming that the game is designed to highlight the difference between @entity1 gun culture and @entity76 - which he says has spiraled out of control			1
' i grew up in @entity147 , @entity148 , where i remember guns and ammunition being available in unmanned sections of @entity152 and it being commonplace to hear gunshots in the distance as i tried to go to sleep , which is a stark contrast to @entity157 , @entity1 , where i moved to in 2001 , ' @entity2 says in an audio message in the credits to the game			2
a video game called ' the slaying of @entity7 ' has caused pain and outrage among families of victims and survivors ' @entity1 had sweeping gun control put into place after the 1996 @entity170 in which 35 people died , and the result of that sweeping regulation is that guns are no longer a noticeable part of @entity1 culture			1
guns are practically non-existent here			0
' back in @entity76 … all these massacres do n’t seem to have had any similar effect on regulation			0
instead , gun control and enforcement have steadily loosened , ' he said in his message			0
' and here we are , nearly a year after the @entity7 shootings … and absolutely nothing positive has come out of it			2
' this explanation has not been sufficient for the families of those who lost their lives in @entity7			2
@entity90 asked @entity2 on monday , ' how playing a game that recreates how @entity193 died would be beneficial ? please tell us , ' the family 's tweet read			1
withering : the official @entity98 account for the family of victim @entity193 got shirt thrift from @entity2 when they asked him to clarify why he had created such a controversial game @entity2 , who claims to be based in @entity157 , @entity1 , replied : ' sure , but you 'd learn more by ' playing it			1
' ' it ’s absolutely disgusting that somebody thinks this is funny , ' said @entity90 , whose late daughter , @entity91 , 27 , was awarded the @entity208 for shielding her students from the gunfire during the rampage			0
' we ’re all suffering			0
all the families are suffering			0
we ’re coming up on december			0
my daughter ’s birthday just passed			0
it just adds insult to the suffering that we ’re dealing with			0
it ’s just incomprehensible that someone would think this kind of thing is wanted			0
' but it is not just the families that @entity2 claims have attacked him			2
on his @entity98 page , the game designer said that he has faced the fury of almost everyone			2
gone but not forgotten : an aerial photo showing demolition work near completion at @entity7 in @entity126 , @entity127 last week			2
the decision was taken to raze the building after the shooting massacre last december ' the liberals do n't like me because i 've disrespected the dead			0
the conservatives do n't like me because of the gun - control message			0
the conspiracy theorists do n't like me because it risks informing people of what happened			0
and the trolls do n't like me because it was n't edgy enough , ' he wrote on @entity98			0
@entity2 also tweeted a screen grab of an email he claims to be from @entity251 assistant general counsel @entity250 which demands that he remove a link to the @entity251 site on the info page of his ' vile ' game			2
@entity2 responded by saying , ' i regret to inform the @entity251 , it ’s impossible to undo what ’s been done , ' along with a profane remark			0
@entity76 sen. @entity260 ( @entity261 ) told the @entity262 the game was ' absolutely sickening ' and called its creator ' very disturbed			0

@entity2 has caused fury with his @entity7 video game in which players can reenact the massacre in which 20 children and six teachers died
it *emerged* that @entity2 designed a similar game based on the @entity12 massacre of 2007
in an *unrepentant* interview given at the time @entity2 described himself as not *concerned* what *grieving* families thought
he attempted to justify the game as ' art '
