@entity0 , which recently survived a ‘ graze ’ with the @entity2 , has been captured on camera in spectacular fashion by the commander of the @entity6			1
@entity7 saw the comet from a magnificent vantage point – 240 miles above the @entity11 ’s horizon			2
he described seeing the comet as ‘ the most amazing thing i have ever seen in space ’ in an interview with @entity17 in @entity18			0
this was the comet that lived			0
@entity37 ’s @entity36 caught the great escape on camera			0
after the dramatic event it tweeted : ‘ @entity42 ! @entity43 lives ! @entity44 has survived its journey around the sun to reemerge on the other side			1
’ @entity43 was only discovered on november 27 this year and was named after the amateur @entity48 astronomer who spotted it , @entity43			1
@entity37 's @entity36 captured @entity0 diving past the sun just 87,000 miles from the surface - and surviving the ' graze ' @entity53 is on : @entity43 emerges from the clutches of the @entity2 and was spotted escaping by @entity37 's @entity36 it is classed as a ‘ @entity56 ’ , which is a class of comet whose orbit comes very close to the @entity2 they are named after the 19th - century @entity62 astronomer @entity61 , who figured out that they are actually the remains of one huge comet that broke apart			1
soon after @entity43 was found three separate space agencies excitedly began tracking its trajectory – @entity37 , the @entity68 and the @entity69			1
its fate was quickly marked as doomed because it would rush headlong into the @entity2 ’s hellish corona			2
writing on the @entity75 website , @entity73 scientist @entity72 said : ‘ we have here an exceptionally rare opportunity to observe the complete vaporization of a relatively large comet , and we have approximately 18 instruments on five different satellites that are trying to do just that			0
’ team effort : this map illustrates how countries from all over the world contribute to the running of the @entity6 however , @entity43 had other ideas and in a brief , but very clear , clip can be seen zooming away to safety from the @entity2 ’s fiery clutches			1
@entity93 , from the @entity94 , was stunned by @entity43 's close encounter			1
he told @entity96 : ‘ it was an extraordinary event			0
@entity43 was incredibly close to the @entity2 , closer to the @entity2 than the @entity11 is to the @entity98			1
‘ and it ’s certainly a pretty rare event			0
the @entity101 [ note : the video is from the @entity36 ] has seen many examples of comets being destroyed as they approached the @entity2 and there was a great deal of interest in this because there was an expectation of spectacular debris			2
‘ i suppose if something is big and tough enough it will survive			0
this event tells us that the comet was rather more robust than expected			0
doubtless it had a very rough ride though ! ’ mr @entity93 explained that comets have probably survived skirmishes with the @entity2 before , but we just have n’t been able to see them			2
‘ it just shows how good the technology is now , ’ he added .			0

last week @entity43 came within 87,000 miles of the @entity2 's @entity125
