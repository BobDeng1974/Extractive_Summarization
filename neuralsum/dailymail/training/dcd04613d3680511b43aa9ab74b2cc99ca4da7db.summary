@entity25 at @entity26 is selling nativity costumes for £ 8 - including @entity28 , shepherd and sheep - but parents have found sizes sell out fast as time - poor parents buy instead of make their child 's school nativity outfits traditional : children from @entity38 primary school in @entity39 show off their homemade outfits many of the outfits have been posted by savvy parents , who have snapped up bargains at supermarkets , such as @entity26 , @entity46 and @entity47 's , where the costumes cost around £ 8 each			1
a lot of the nativity clothes have now sold out in the supermarket stores or on their websites , so prices are rocketing on @entity7			2
' we 've only just been told that our son is a shepherd in the school play and most of the supermarkets have sold out of his size , so i 've had to buy on @entity7 , " said @entity54 , 37 , from @entity55			1
' it 's very annoying when i could have bought a similar costume for less a third of the price a few weeks ago			0
' hot property : an angel costume similar to those that sell for £ 8 in @entity26 recently sold for £ 24 on auction site @entity7 a spokesman for @entity7 said sales of nativity costumes had shot up by 102 per cent over the last fortnight on @entity7			1
he said sales of nativity wear were also up 57 per cent compared to this time last year and there were currently 3,000 outfits listed on the site			0

a spokesman for @entity26 said there has been a 40 per cent increase in sales of single tea towels and its multi-buy five pack tea towels , which the supermarket has attributed to mothers making homemade shepherd headdresses			1
@entity99 , 40 , from @entity100 , south west @entity101 , said : ‘ i spent days trawling the internet looking for a @entity28 or @entity104 costume for my son , @entity105 , who is six , to wear in his nativity play			0
' i looked on every site i could think of but everything had sold out in his size – all i could find was one costume that was £ 40 , which was far too much			0
' i was desperate , and my son was horrifed at the prospect of me cobbling something together with my rusty sewing skills , but eventually a friend found him a brilliant costume at @entity26			0
‘ next year i will start looking earlier , but the schools do n’t tend to tell you what part your child has until december anyway , so it ’s always a rush			0
' @entity128 , 37 , from @entity129 , north @entity101 , said : ' i was given just a few days to make my children 's costumes after the school left it until the week of the play to send a letter telling us which part our child had			1
' i was keen to make the costumes rather than buy them - ours were always homemade when we were young and i have such fond memories of our wonky outfits - but i did n't even have a weekend to get together fabric and have a go			1
' i ended up buying my daughter 's outfit , but my son was a shepherd so he got the bed sheet plus tea towel treatment			1
' his outfit looked very cute - and exactly the same as the school play shepherds 30 or more years ago when i was in the nativity			2

nevertheless , an overwhelming majority of fathers , 89 per cent , would want to go to their little one ’s nativity regardless of what role they were given , found a poll by @entity179			0

*festive* costumes usually sell for around £ 8 at @entity25 at @entity26 or @entity46
parents told too late which part their child has in school play *complain* they have no time to make outfits
sizes sell out as parents buy instead of make outfits and @entity7 prices soar
@entity26 say *soaring* tea towel sales prove some parents still make costumes
