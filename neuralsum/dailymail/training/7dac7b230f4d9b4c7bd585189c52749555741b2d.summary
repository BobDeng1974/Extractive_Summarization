by @entity1 reporter published : 00:02 est , 30 may 2013 updated : 01:15 est , 30 may 2013 there 's a new breed of airport dog			1
they are n't looking for drugs or bombs - they are looking for people who need a buddy , a belly to rub or a paw to shake			2
' his job is to be touched , ' volunteer @entity13 said about @entity15 , her 5 - year - old golden retriever that works a few hours a week at the @entity19 airport			1
' i am just standing there with him			2
they are talking to him			2
if i need to answer for him , i do			0
but i am at the end of his leash , he 's not at the end of mine			0
' @entity30 is widely credited with introducing the first airport therapy dog in the days after sept. 11 , 2001 , when flights were grounded , passengers were stranded and reaching friends and relatives in the @entity35 was nearly impossible			1
passengers were anxious and afraid			0

the @entity48 has 30 therapy dogs and is hoping to expand its program volunteers with @entity56 ( @entity39 ) walk past the spider legged @entity57 at the @entity48 enter @entity59 , owned by a volunter airport chaplain who got permission to bring the dog to work			1

you never know why people are flying , said @entity76 , director of volunteers at @entity48 , which launched @entity56 ( @entity39 ) in april			1
travelers might be in town for a vacation , a funeral , to visit a sick family member or to attend a business meeting			1
' you can literally feel the stress levels drop , people start smiling , strangers start talking to each other and everybody walks away feeling really , really good , ' @entity76 said			2
dogs have to be healthy , skilled , stable , well - mannered and able to work on a slack 4 - foot leash , said @entity92 , executive director of @entity94 - based @entity93 , which certifies the @entity48 animals			1
they have to be comfortable with crowds , sounds , smells — and they need to pass through security like all airport workers			2
the dogs are intended to take the stress out of travel : the crowds , long lines and terrorism concerns no exceptions : the dogs ahve to go through airport security , just like everyone else handlers are taught to watch for people who fear or dislike dogs or those who might have allergies			1
in most cases , people approach the dogs , identifiable by the vests or bandannas they wear			2
@entity48 ' dogs , which are featured on trading cards , are as varied as its airport passengers			1
there 's a long - haired @entity123 , a lab - pointer mix , a field spaniel , a poodle , three @entity128 @entity127 , a doberman and a 150 - pound @entity131 wolfhound named @entity42 who has two tricks			0
' he looks you in the eye and lays down on the job , ' said owner @entity38			0
' when i 'm around @entity42 , it makes me feel like things are ok			0
when @entity42 's around other people , they are ok			0
it 's almost instant , even if just for a moment , ' @entity38 said			0
@entity67 's sole dog , @entity143 , a 4 - year - old golden retriever , is a star			1

when @entity171 's family recently flew home from vacation in @entity174 she requested @entity143 meet the plane to greet her 5 - year - old daughter , @entity176 , who is autistic			2
she knew @entity176 would be low on energy and patience and they still had a 2.5 - hour drive home to @entity182			0
@entity143 and handler @entity183 were there with a gift basket and @entity176 fell in love with the dog			2
' thank you for visiting us at the airport so i would be happy , ' @entity176 said in a video the family made for @entity143			2

despite all the smiles , there are also hard moments			0
