by @entity0 they may not be the usual tourist sports but for one urban explorer these abandoned buildings are the ideal holiday destinations			1
photographer @entity6 has travelled around the world to take pictures of the beautiful buildings that have been largely forgotten			1
however , his hobby is a dangerous one and he has been arrested 20 times for trespass in just five years			1
the building , in @entity26 , was erected in 1872 as a reconstruction of a @entity28			0
it ceased being used in 2003 after failing to meet fire safety regulations and lay abandoned for seven years until a series of renovation plans were put forward			2
a private investor wants to turn the building into shops , a grand cafe , restaurants and a luxirous hotel			0
renovation work on the outside of the building has begun			0
hidden gems : the photographer often has to squeeze through windows and gaps in buildings or climb up walls to get in to abandoned rooms like this @entity22 theatre left in a hurry ? hundreds of books have been left on the shelves in this but abandoned @entity55 manor house but the wallpaper is ripped and the ceiling has partly collapsed industrial : the original @entity58 in @entity59 was built in 1868			1
now replaced by a modern sewage pumping station , @entity58 is used as a film location and represented @entity62 in @entity63 mr @entity6 has gained unique access to some of the rarest places in the world and uses any method he can to do so.the 33 - year - old photographer creeps , ducks , climbs , scrambles and squeezes his way into abandoned sites and buildings to get unparalleled holiday experiences - even having to sidestep security at times			1
but for all the times he ’s been arrested or given a stern telling off from police , he insists it ’s all worth it			1
mr @entity6 , of @entity59 , said : ' i ’ve seen sneaking around places i should n’t have been in since i was a teenager but have been more focussed in the past five years			1
place of worship : two religious statues - in almost perfect condition - still stand in this abandoned @entity22 monastery former glory : the @entity88 in @entity89 , known simply as @entity90 , was once an iconic site of @entity55 engineering but has been neglected since its closure in 2000			2
it is now scheduled for demolition but , in its heyday after the @entity97 , it was at the forefront of gas turbine and jet engine research eerie : mr @entity6 said despite the creepiness of buildings like the @entity106 , in the @entity55 ( left ) , and a city hall in @entity20 ( right ) , he is not interested in ' ghouls ' dangerous hobby : the photographer said he has previously been held at gunpoint by @entity113 police after trespassing to take pictures of abandoned buildings like this villa in @entity113 school 's out forever : this beautiful building was once filled with @entity55 schoolchildren but is now slowly decaying ' i enjoy seeing what most people do n’t get to see when they go abroad and the buzz of getting into the buildings			1
i used to work in the city so the peace and quiet of an abandoned building and the lack of people getting in my photos were also things i enjoyed about it			2
' i started to meet people who did the same thing and before you know it you ’re going most weekends			0
' the photographer jumps in his car with a basic idea of where he ’s heading and off he goes			2
he has travelled through @entity113 , @entity20 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 enjoying his passion for urban exploring			1
mysterious : @entity148 is known about the ornate @entity149 in @entity150 but it is regularly visited by urban explorers fascinated by its decaying splendour left behind : this vintage @entity156 sewing machine has been left in the chateau with a cotton reel still attached to the top @entity160 : objects like the stuffed pheasant at a @entity22 villa ( left ) and the shoes left in front of the burner at a hunting lodge ( right ) , give clues to the former owners @entity170 : the green bed screens are still pulled across in this abanonded ward in @entity173 in @entity174 , @entity175			2
built in 1923 , the hospital was slowly run down from the mid- 1990s and most of the buildings closed in 2003 untouched : @entity180 power station in @entity181 , @entity22 , was hugely popular with urban explorers wanting to capture on film the huge rusting machinery but it is now being pulled down by the authorities despite the unbeatable views , mr @entity6 insists the biggest adrenaline rush is avoiding getting caught			1
he said : ' i rarely get spooked when i visit rotting and neglected places - i ’m not really into the ghouls and ghost side of it - but you do get an increase in heart rate when hiding from security and they get within metres of you			0
' in the @entity55 there 's not a great deal police can do as long as you do n’t break in or steal anything as trespassing is a civil offence			2
once a home : the ornate twin beds at this @entity22 chateau are still intact but the wallpaper has peeled and the floor is covered in rubble beautiful : @entity212 , in @entity213 , @entity113 , ( left ) is one of the most spectacular captured by the photographer			1
it is commonly known as @entity217 - meaning ' nothing further beyond ' - because the words are decorated inside			0
built in 1605 , it is filled with dazzling @entity221 designs and mosaics			0
it 's ornate designs are in contrast to the stark , giant walls of this @entity22 cooling tower ( right ) creepy : this atmospheric picture of a derelict @entity22 hunting lodge looks like it could have come straight out of a horror film holy site : the stunning mural can be seen on the far wall of this @entity22 church but it seems to have been abandoned by its congregation ' but in the @entity145 it ’s illegal to trespass so the stakes are a little higher and if you do get caught it all depends on the country and the mood the police are in			0
' it ’s ranged from a chat and being allowed around the building to lying on the floor as a policeman holds a submachine gun and shouts angrily in @entity113			0
' generally always just ends in a bit of a telling off			0
' glorious : this dome sits on top of the former @entity257 - @entity256 sanitorium in @entity20 , where @entity258 recuperated after his @entity260 injury			0
from 1945 to 1995 it was used as a @entity263 hospital but attempts to privatise it after the @entity266 withdrawal were not wholly successful			0
while some buildings are still in use , the surgery , psychiatric ward and rife range were all abandoned glimpse into the past : lights and a table still covered with a white sheet remain at this @entity55 hospital ( left ) and candlesticks and glass vases and mirrors have just been left in this @entity22 chateau industrial beauty : no one has ever removed this blast furnace in @entity22 , which remains standing in almost the same condition as when it was used frozen in time : some abandoned buildings such as @entity287 in @entity150 has fallen foul of metal thieves and vandals			1
