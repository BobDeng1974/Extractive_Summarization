unwanted surprise : @entity4 ordered a sausage biscuit but what he received was an @entity17 muffin , buttered and covered in jelly — with several bites taken out of it ' i was driving , hurrying and nearly bit into it before i looked down and saw it , ' said mr @entity4 to the @entity34			1
' @entity35 ( his wife ) wanted me to take it back , but we were already several miles down the road by then and did n't want to miss kickoff			2
' mr @entity4 made a number of phone calls to the fast food giant and even went back to the same @entity2 's store to tell them about his unwelcome surprise , however so far he has not heard anything from the chain			1
' i still have n't gotten as much as a ' we 're sorry this happened ' or ' we 'll check the videotape and see how this happened			2
' they act like they do n't care that i received an order that somebody else — i 'm assuming one of their employees — had been eating			2

she was rude and never even offered an ' i 'm sorry			0
' ' i 'm not out to get @entity2 's , i 'm not out to sue them			1
but i would like an apology			0

and then call me and tell me what happened			0
