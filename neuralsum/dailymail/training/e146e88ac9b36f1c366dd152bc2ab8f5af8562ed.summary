sea ice cover in the @entity1 is now at its highest level since records began			1
satellite images show 7.7 million square miles ( 20 million sq km ) of ice surrounding the continent			1
but rather than disproving global warming , scientists claim that this growth may in fact be caused by it			0
satellite images taken recently show 7.7 million square miles ( 20 million square kilometres ) of sea around the @entity15 than disproving global warming , scientists claim that the growth in sea ice is caused by it the ice has broken records on about 150 days this year , showing that it is gaining much greater coverage than in previous years			1
the area of sea ice seen from space is roughly double the size of the @entity1 continent and about three times the size of @entity29			1
dr @entity30 , a sea ice specialist at @entity32 told @entity33 that the new records add to an ' exciting ' puzzle for climate scientists			0
each record - breaking year is different due to variations in seasonal weather â€” ' it 's those differences that will tell us something , ' he said			0
trends in sea ice duration , 1979 - 2010 , showing large regional variations			0
rather than disproving global warming , some scientists claim that the growth in sea ice may in fact be caused by it @entity52 winds , which flow around @entity1 , are speeding up and moving south			1
this is thought to be linked to an increase in greenhouse gases and an increase in sea ice the growth of sea ice is n't even , however			1
the region west of the @entity62 , for instance , shows a large decline in sea ice			0
conversely , in areas such as the @entity67 , sea ice is increasing			0
according to @entity69 at @entity33 , there are two main theories to explain the changes in @entity1 sea ice			2
the first is that westerly winds , which flow around @entity1 , are speeding up and moving south			1
this is thought to be linked to an increase in greenhouse gases and an increase in sea ice			1
the second theory is that sea ice forms easier due to the colder and fresher melt water from @entity1 's melting glaciers and ice sheets			1
despite sea ice increasing glaciers in the northern @entity62 are melting faster than ever before , warns new research			1
and small glaciers in that area could disappear within 200 years , according to the study			0
researchers warned that increased snowfall will not prevent the continued melting , and the ' unprecedented ' glacier recession will result in ' significant ' contributions to sea level rises			0
an international team of researchers , led by dr @entity98 , from @entity99 , has discovered that small glaciers that end on land around the @entity62 are highly vulnerable to slight changes in air temperature and may be at risk of disappearing within 200 years			0
the scientists said that temperatures are currently rising rapidly in the @entity62 , and because warmer air holds more moisture , the amount of snowfall has also increased			0
some researchers have suggested that this may offset the melting of the glaciers , however this study found that just a small rise in air temperature increased melting so much that even large amounts of extra snowfall could not prevent glacier recession			2
another theory for increasing sea ice in the @entity122 is that sea ice forms easier due to the colder and fresher melt water from @entity1 's melting glaciers and ice sheets ' this is an area covered by sea ice which we 've never seen from space before , ' @entity131 from the @entity132 and @entity133 told @entity134			2
' thirty - five years ago the first satellites went up which were reliably telling us what area , two dimensional area , of sea ice was covered and we 've never seen that before , that much area			0
' however , as the area covered in sea ice around @entity1 expands , scientists claim the ice on the continent is continuing to melt			2
researchers are now using autonomous underwater robots to measure the thickness of @entity1 sea ice with much greater accuracy over bigger areas .			2

images suggest there is 7.7 million square miles of sea around continent
this is double size of the @entity1 and three times the size of @entity29
fast westerly winds , which go around @entity1 , are now moving south
this is linked to an increase in greenhouse gases and increase in sea ice
separate study found region 's glaciers are melting faster than ever before
