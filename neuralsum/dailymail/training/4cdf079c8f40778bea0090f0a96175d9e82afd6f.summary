@entity0 has been ruled out for up to eight weeks with a neck injury , plunging @entity3 ’s preparations for the autumn tests at @entity5 into turmoil			1
the 23 - year - old @entity8 lock has been suffering from a persistent neck problem , caused by a nerve irritation , and @entity3 have reluctantly had to accept that he will miss the four - match series			1
uncapped @entity14 second row @entity12 has been called into the squad to replace @entity16 , while @entity18 ’s @entity17 is on course to start alongside @entity20 against @entity21 on saturday			0
@entity3 and @entity8 lock @entity0 has been ruled out of his country 's entire autumn series @entity16 , pictured in action for his club side @entity8 , has picked up a neck injury the loss of @entity16 was not the only setback ahead of @entity3 ’s showdown with the world champions			1
head coach @entity32 has also lost @entity35 pair @entity33 and @entity36 with hand and hamstring injuries respectively			1
while the impressive form of @entity17 is a consolation , the absence of @entity16 will be keenly felt			0
he has established himself as a stalwart of the pack while starting his country ’s last 20 tests			0
when @entity3 demolished the @entity21 38 - 21 at @entity5 two years ago , the rookie lock was at the vanguard of the breakdown onslaught which paved the way for a historic win			2
@entity32 attempted to strike a philosophical note , saying : ‘ it ’s obviously disappointing but it ’s important for @entity0 , @entity3 and @entity8 that he has the appropriate rest and recovery period , and we are confident that he will be back in the @entity57			1
’ @entity16 ( left ) in action catching the ball from a line - out in @entity3 's match against @entity62 in february the absence of @entity16 ( left ) is a big blow to @entity32 's autumn plans his injury has lengthened the casualty list among the front - five forwards			1
@entity3 must take on @entity21 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 in the coming weeks without @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and now @entity16			1
the other area of primary concern is midfield , where @entity32 was already without the heavy - duty threat posed by @entity81			0
now he will be denied the imposing presence of @entity33 , too			0
‘ @entity33 has seen the specialist and , while the news is positive that he could be available later in the series , he will stay with the @entity87 ’ medical team this week , ’ said the head coach			0
‘ we will look to bring him into camp further down the line			0
’ but @entity33 is unlikely to come into selection contention until @entity3 face @entity69 on november 22			2
@entity32 is preparing to go into the series opener with @entity95 of @entity96 restored to the starting xv , in the less - familiar no 13 shirt , and @entity18 ’s @entity99 at inside centre — as long as he can prove he has fully overcome a rib injury			0
out wide , another of @entity18 ’s turbo - charged back - line , @entity105 - born @entity104 , is poised to make his @entity3 test debut against the @entity21 .			2

@entity3 and @entity8 lock @entity0 has picked up a neck injury
he has been ruled out of @entity3 's entire @entity111
@entity3 are *due* to face @entity21 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70
coach @entity32 is *hopeful* he will be back in the new year
