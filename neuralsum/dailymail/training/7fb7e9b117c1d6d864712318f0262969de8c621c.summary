click here to read @entity2 's @entity1 on @entity4 's turbulent spell as a @entity6 player			2
@entity8 's shot was parried by @entity9 in @entity11 's goal and the ball fell invitingly to @entity4 with an open goal in front of him			1
the @entity17 striker was left with a simple tap - in , went to side - foot the ball into the net but it instead flew miles over the bar			1
that was n't the first open goal he has missed this season			0
blocked ) in these games			0
has now had 30 shots this season in the @entity43 ( incl			2
only two players ( @entity63 36 , @entity64 32 ) have had more			0
has attempted more shots ( 30 , incl			0
blocked ) without actually scoring than any other player in the top five @entity68 leagues this season			0
as if a flavour of things to come , in @entity4 's debut against @entity73 he did the same , albeit from further out			2
@entity74 rushed from his line but spooned his clearance straight to the @entity17 player , who took a touch , steadied himself , then , 25 yards from goal , horribly skewed an effort wide			2
@entity30 clapped on the @entity82 touchline with a huge grin on his face			2
@entity4 has no goals in six league games and just a single goal against @entity91 side @entity89 - the joke is beginning to wear thin			1
that £ 16million price - tag is increasing in weight with every missed chance			1
this is a player who in 2010 only rated @entity97 above him , then in 2013 was gracious enough to add @entity99 to that list			0
' when i score , i do n't celebrate because i 'm only doing my job			0
when a postman delivers letters , does he celebrate ? ' @entity4 asked in 2012			2
@entity106 - who eventually left @entity11 for @entity107 - was available at half the price @entity17 ended up paying for @entity4 @entity8 talks to the 24 - year - old on sunday ( left ) , but @entity4 cut a frustrated figure all afternoon for @entity30 ' side the striker was easily brushed aside by @entity11 defender @entity113 and failed to assert himself on proceedings throughout @entity4 likened himself to a postman back in 2012 , but @entity116 ( pictured above ) would fancy himself to deliver more regularly than @entity4 @entity4 's heat map from the win - click here for more amazing stats but postmen nearly always manage to get their deliveries through the letterbox			1
surely if @entity116 spent two months wildly throwing letters at doors , leaving the streets strewn with unopened envelopes , before finally getting one in , he would n't hold back with at least a slight fist - pump			0
no player in @entity132 's top five leagues has had more shots without scoring than @entity4 's 30 this season			2
he added another seven against @entity11 on sunday to reach that total and there is only one other @entity43 game this season where a player has had more shots on goal without putting the ball in the back of the net			1
and that player was @entity4			2
against @entity146 , where he had 10 without reward in the @entity149 derby			0
@entity106 was available for around £ 8m in the summer , mysteriously failing a medical at @entity17 which he then passed at @entity107			1
he is languishing on the @entity152 bench , while @entity4 is afforded plenty of minutes by @entity30 with little to show for it			1
with @entity155 ruled out for possibly another four weeks , @entity17 need a goal - scorer , a skill @entity106 has proved he has in the @entity43			1
@entity158 was also available for the same price as @entity4 , but moved to @entity160 instead			0
in fact , plenty of forwards were up for grabs in the summer			0
@entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 all switched clubs , while @entity169 was open to ending his difficult time at @entity171			0
@entity17 instead opted for @entity4 , but the transfer smacked of desperation			1
' i can categorically tell you @entity4 will not be at @entity17 , ' @entity30 said ahead of their pre-season friendly against @entity177 in @entity178 at the beginning of august			1
exactly three weeks later , with no replacement found for @entity182 , they had bought the player from @entity184			0
it was a ' no - brainer , ' @entity30 said			1
@entity4 got away with his misses against @entity11			1
@entity113 and @entity187 both scored in their own net for @entity17 to win 3 - 2			1
@entity30 defended him , yet again , afterwards : ' the guy is doing his best and working really hard and it is not dropping for him			0
i 'd say he would have finished that if @entity187 had not put it in			0
' unfortunately for @entity4 , @entity187 did put it in and along with @entity196 the @entity11 defenders have now scored more @entity43 goals for @entity17 than him so far this campaign			1
@entity17 legend @entity199 gave a more brutal assessment : ' @entity4 is a waste of space at the minute			1
' it is hard to disagree , at the minute			0

video we were n't at our best - @entity30			2

@entity4 has yet to find the net for @entity17 in six @entity43 games this season
the @entity40 striker blazed over the bar when just eight yards out during the win against @entity11
@entity30 *splurged* £ 16million on @entity4 in the summer , which many thought was a *bargain*
the @entity17 manager called the *signing* a ' no - brainer ' when he arrived from @entity184
