by @entity0 published : 12:39 est , 17 january 2014 updated : 12:40 est , 17 january 2014 pregnant women who use nicotine patches and gum increase their child 's risk of obesity mothers - to - be who use nicotine patches or chewing gum could be making their children more prone to obesity			1
children face an increased risk of obesity if their mother uses nicotine replacement therapy ( @entity20 ) such as nasal spray or lozenges , as well as the more common forms like nicotine gum			1
the dangers of smoking while pregnant are well established with years of advertisements reporting ‘ smoking while pregnant harms your baby ’			2
past studies have shown the chances of a baby being obese doubles if their mother smoked during pregnancy , but the effect of nicotine supplements was not known			2
the new research suggests that not only do pregnant women who use @entity20 have smaller babies , but that within six months the nicotine has affected their liver so it produces more triglyceride - a sign of obesity			2
dr @entity48 of the @entity49 at the @entity50 in @entity51 , @entity52 , said : ‘ we knew smoking was bad during pregnancy			0
‘ but the problem is one fifth of pregnant women in @entity52 continue to smoke , and 30 prospective studies have shown us that that babies born to smoking mothers have a 47 per cent increase in the odds of becoming overweight			0
‘ and here 's the interesting thing , that 's even after adjusting for mum 's diet and socio - economic status			0
‘ our studies were designed to find if there is a biological basis between nicotine exposure from either @entity20 or smoking , and obesity and metabolic syndrome later in the offspring 's life			1
’ scientists found that lab rats which were given the same amount of nicotine , adjusted for weight , that an average smoker takes in a day had smaller babies , but that was n't the most startling finding			0
six months after they were given the dose , when they reached adulthood , the rats had developed an increase in liver and circulating triglycerides , a sign of obesity			0
although @entity20 is still less harmful to the child than smoking , dr @entity48 said doctors may need to look more closely at the long - term safety and efficacy of nicotine in pregnancy on postnatal health and well - being			1
despite the increased risk of obesity , using @entity20 remains safer for an unborn baby than smoking is the scientists are now looking at whether folic acid could prevent or reverse the nicotine damage to the developing liver			1
previously acid has been shown to reduce circulating triglycerides , and smoking mothers have been found to have low levels of folate , so scientists believe acid could be the key			0
children and adults both require folic acid to produce healthy red blood cells and prevent anaemia			1
the research is published online in the journal @entity127 .			0

children face an increased risk of obesity in later life if their mother used nicotine replacement therapy ( @entity20 ) during their pregnancy
using @entity20 is not as harmful for an unborn baby as smoking is
the researchers are now trying to establish whether folic acid could undo the damage caused by nicotine
