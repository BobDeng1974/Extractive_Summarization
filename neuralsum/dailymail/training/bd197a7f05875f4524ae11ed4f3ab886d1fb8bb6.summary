@entity0 may be considered the romance capital of the world , but it turns out that @entity3 is the most amorous nation			1
@entity5 people sent more love - related messages on @entity7 than any other region last year , ahead of @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11			1
and this may be linked to the fact the language was recently found to be the happiest and most positive by mathematicians			2
@entity5 users of messaging app @entity7 sent the most love - related stickers during 2014 , and a separate study found that @entity5 is the most positive language			1
people in @entity3 use words such as ‘ love ’ and ‘ laughter ’ more than any other region			1
@entity5 couple @entity26 ( left ) and @entity27 pictured @entity7 said its @entity5 users sent the most love - related stickers on its messaging app during 2014 and the ‘ kissing couple ’ sticker topped the list globally			1
in a separate study , a team of researchers , led by dr @entity37 from the @entity38 , built a database of billions of individual words from 10 of the most popular languages using online sources			1
this included @entity44 , @entity45 , subtitles on films and tv shows , song lyrics and the @entity50 in @entity5 , @entity52 , @entity51 , @entity9 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58			1
in a separate study , a team of researchers studied 100,000 words across 10 languages ( a yellow box indicates the row language is more positive than the column language , and a blue background shows the reverse ) @entity5 was the happiest ( pictured ) and @entity52 was the most negatively skewed once all of these words were plotted , the researchers found that every language studied was inherently positive , and more words fell on the right of centre than left			1
three examples are shown in @entity5 , @entity51 and @entity52 ( top to bottom )			1
the centre line is the average , yellow is positive and blue is negative 1			0
@entity52 from this , the scientists compiled a list of 10,000 most commonly used words in each language and labelled each as either positive and negative			1
for example , the words ‘ lying ’ and ‘ cried ’ were plotted on the negative side , while ‘ love ’ and ‘ laughter ’ were positive words			1
once all of these words were plotted , the researchers found that every language studied was inherently positive , and more words fell on the right of centre than the left			1
‘ using human evaluation of 100,000 words spread across 10 languages diverse in origin and culture , we present evidence of a deep imprint of human sociality in language , ’ said the study			1
‘ the words of natural human language possess a universal positivity bias , the estimated emotional content of words is consistent between languages under translation , and this positivity bias is strongly independent of frequency of word use			2
' to test these findings , the team applied their analysis to books including @entity128 ’s @entity127 , ( top ) @entity132 ’s @entity131 ( middle ) , and @entity133 ’ @entity134 ( bottom )			2
they mapped the emotional content and plotted peaks and troughs throughout each and at the top of this list was @entity5 , which had the highest skew towards positive sentiment			2
@entity52 was at the opposite end of the scale			2
research from money transfer site @entity146 found that on @entity150 , people send £ 35 ( $ 54 ) to £ 60 ( $ 92 ) extra on average to loved ones			0
when it comes to the amount sent , @entity153 are the most generous , sending an average of £ 63 ( $ 97 ) more on @entity150 than on any other day of the month			0
people from @entity158 and @entity159 were in second and third place , spending an average of £ 54 ( $ 83 ) and £ 52 ( $ 80 ) extra respectively			0
@entity51 was in third place			0
to test these findings , the team later applied their analysis to books including @entity128 ’s @entity127 , @entity132 ’s @entity131 , and @entity133 ’ @entity134			0
they mapped the emotional content and plotted peaks and troughs throughout each			0
language used in @entity131 was predominantly positive but ended on a very low point			0
@entity134 had the lowest dip at around the third - way mark but ended very positively			0
@entity127 had the highest peak a quarter of the way , sentiment fell at the half - way mark and the book ended on a low			0
these peaks and troughs in positive and negative language related to high and low points in the narrative , going someway to prove mr @entity37 ' research			2
the findings were published in the journals @entity188			0
separate research from @entity45 found that @entity191 is the country most likely to tweet ' i love you			2
' the site has created an interactive ‘ @entity200 ’ map that reflects the volume of tweets mentioning this phrase in 100 different languages			0
this volume was then related to the total population of each country to establish the ranking			0
the @entity205 came in at 51 out of the 173 countries that @entity45 operates in , and the top five countries were @entity191 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 of @entity211 and @entity212			0
@entity7 said its @entity5 users sent the most love - related stickers on its messaging app during 2014 , ahead of @entity9 , @entity216 , @entity11 and @entity217 ( picutred )			1
the ‘ kissing couple ’ sticker topped the list globally separate research from @entity45 instead found that @entity191 is the country most likely to tweet ' i love you			1
' the site has created an interactive ‘ @entity200 ’ map ( pictured ) that reflects the volume of tweets mentioning this phrase in 100 different languages			0
the @entity205 came in at 51 out of the 173 countries that @entity45 operates in			0

@entity5 users send the most love - related stickers on @entity7
this was ahead of users in @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity217 and @entity58
a separate study found that @entity5 is the most positive language
@entity3 used words like ‘ love ’ and ‘ laughter ’ more than any region studied
@entity52 is the least positive , according to analysis of 100,000 words
