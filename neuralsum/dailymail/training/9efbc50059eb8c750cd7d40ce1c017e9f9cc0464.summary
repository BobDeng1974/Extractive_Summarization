@entity11 @entity10 are under pressure to make £ 7.5m in financial savings following cutbacks in government funding			1

mr @entity16 says people could get in touch with police instead via the free internet video service @entity7			2
a survey has now been sent out to homes across the county requesting families ' views on the proposal			0
mr @entity16 said : ' it 's just an idea but we would presumably have a @entity7 address for the force control room or there might be scope for having it more locally based			0
alternative : victims of crime will be encouraged to report incidents via services such as @entity7 ' we know we have got £ 7.5 million to save in the next two years and that police stations in total across the county cost us £ 3m a year			1
" it is possible some smaller ones would be the ones to go just because the front desk is quiet - some of them barely have three or four people come in a day			0
' the first thing i wanted to do was test the public mood and see how open people are to the idea and in what ways they access the police service			0
