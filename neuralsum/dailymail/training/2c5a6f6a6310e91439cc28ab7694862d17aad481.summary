by @entity0 locals in a quiet country town have paid homage to the humble pumpkin by holding their annual festival to celebrate the vegetable they credit for saving them from a devastating drought			1
residents of @entity10 in south - east @entity11 , population 450 , have taken part in a series of events involving the locally grown produce including pumpkin shotput , pumpkin bowls and the blue riband event of pumpkin rolling , which involves competitors hurling the orange food stuff down a steep hill in the centre of town			1
for the last weekend in may , the number of people in the normally sleepy truck stop swells to 14,000 as competitors flock from as far afield as @entity30 and other parts of @entity32 to join in the @entity33			1
roads are closed and spectators watch from behind barriers as the vegetable is tossed down @entity55			2
there is no one more dedicated to the roll than @entity10 resident @entity59 who was born on the street where the event is held			0
' it 's our eighteenth ( festival ) , i missed the first one but i 'm rolling my 17th time , ' the 83 - year - old said			1
the 450 - person population of @entity10 grows to 14,000 at the festival that started in 1997 - to help local businesses who were heavily impacted by the drought a casualty of the roll down @entity74			1
police close roads to cater for the competition ms @entity59 said she kept up the tradition because it was a lot of fun			0
the festival 's success has come as a surprise to its co-ordinator @entity83			0
her daughter , @entity84 - who is also on the organising committee - said her mum had eaten her words since the festival 's popularity			0
tens of thousands of spectators stand behind barriers to ensure no injuries or interference roads are closed off to make sure the pumpkins have a safe passage down the hill ' it started out because we were in a really bad drought and had a couple of think tank meetings as to how we could get people into @entity10 as businesses were n't doing well with the drought , ' @entity84 said			1
' there was a @entity108 lady here who was rolling pumpkins down the hill to feed her cattle and she suggested we should have a pumpkin festival and @entity114 actually said ' it wo n't work '			1
' in the first year we had about 30 stalls and 800 people turn up			2
now that has grown to our maximum of 250 stalls and 14,000 people			0
mum 's eating her words a bit			0
' the event 's popularity , in part , is due to the efforts of more than 120 volunteers			0
some helped slice and dice half a tonne of the vegetable for the well - guarded secret pumpkin soup recipe - only available on the day			0
one of the events at the festival include the @entity136 as its name suggests , pumpkins are the theme of the weekend held at @entity10 in south - east @entity11			2
