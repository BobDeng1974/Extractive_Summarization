it 's a saturday night in @entity1 , a small town in @entity4 's @entity3 province , and huge crowds have gathered around a makeshift boxing ring ahead of the big fight			1
but the two promising fighters about to take to the ring are n't your average boxers : instead , they 're an 11 - year - old boy named @entity13 and his opposition - a 12 - year - old called @entity15 @entity16 is one of the toughest martial arts in the world and children as young as seven are paid to compete in vicious bouts that attract bets which run into thousands of baht			1
@entity4 boxing allows strikes with the feet and elbows as well as fists professional : despite his lack of years , @entity13 , 11 , is a professional @entity4 boxer @entity4 has an estimated 30,000 child boxers but the impact of beginning a fighting career so young can be severe , with brain damage comparable to that seen in car accident victims and early onset dementia among the risks			1
despite the risks , it is not illegal for children to fight provided they have their parents permission			1
but although young fighters are supposed to wear padded clothing , in practice , they rarely do			1
even if it means the chance of serious injury to their children , in poverty - stricken regions such as @entity3 , the lure of prize money can prove too much to resist - with or without pads			2
one such fighter is @entity13 , a boy from a poor family whose main source of income is the pittance his mother , a nanny working in @entity65 , sends them each month			2
the money he makes is the difference between eating and starving and so , the little boy lives a life that involves four hours of training each day , a strict diet and little time for play			1
' i do it because i get money , ' he explains in his childish treble			2
asked what he 'd do should he manage to win one of the more lucrative fights staged in @entity65 , he replies : ' buy a motorbike ! ' tiny : despite risking brain damage , dementia and serious injury , children as young as seven compete fighter : @entity13 and his father @entity87 who says he worries about what might happen to his son his upcoming fight with @entity91 is an important one and has attracted huge bets , including a 50,000 baht ( £ 1,000 ) flutter raised by his village - a vast amount in @entity4 , where £ 1,000 is more than the average person earns in a year			1
but to win it , he needs to weigh 25kg and is currently 3kg overweight			0
as a result , his father @entity87 has cranked up his regime , which already involves push - ups , lifting oil cans and building up his neck muscles courtesy of a chunk of concrete attached to his hat			1
' this is the most important fight of his career , ' explains mr @entity13			0
' but he needs to lose three kilos before he can fight			0
' his solution is drastic			0
daily 8km runs in 30 degree heat , all while sporting a sweat suit in a bid to get rid of excess water and help him lose weight			1
the competition : @entity13 will face 12 - year - old @entity91 who won his first fight with a knock out aged seven working out : in a bid to lose weight , @entity13 does 8km runs in 30 degree heat while wearing a sweat suit despite the dangers , unemployed mr @entity13 says he has no choice			1
' sometimes we ca n't make ends meet , ' he explains			0
' we are broke and have to borrow money			0
' if he did n't fight , i would go to work in @entity65 with my wife and send money back to my kids , ' he continues			0
' sometimes @entity13 realises how much is riding on his boxing but sometimes he does n't because he 's too young			2
he wants to play - he misses his friends			0
' but not being able to play is the least of @entity13 's concerns			0
as researchers at @entity65 's @entity142 have revealed , the child risks far more than limited playtime			1
' their brains are still growing , ' explains professor @entity145			0
' when you do damage to a child , it 's much more severe than in an adult			1
education : children who show promise in @entity16 are sent to boxing camps with fees paid from winnings brutal : children taking part in @entity16 bouts can kick and elbow their way to victory as well as punch known as ' the art of eight limbs ' @entity16 involves using the arms , shins , fists and feet to overcome opponents			1
invented in @entity4 , the sport became widely popular after being incorporated into military training by @entity170 in 1560			1
until recently , bonds made from knotted rope were used to protect the knuckles and damage the opposing fighter but after several deaths , they were exchanged for padded gloves in the 1990s			2
' there might be some lower intelligence level compared to normal standard kids			0
some do n't think well , do n't feel well but they do n't know how to tell what 's different to them			0
' mr @entity13 is not unaware of the risks and says he does worry about the risk of brain injury			1
' i am worried about damage to his brain but my son loves boxing , ' he says			1
' he wants to fight			0
i told him to stop after the last fight			0
if he does n't fight , our money will go down and that 's a problem because the money is supporting our family			0
' the fact is , i do n't want him to fight			0
he 's still so young			2
' for his own part , @entity13 says he wants to carry on			0
' i will continue training , ' he insists			2
' it makes me strong and it will make my village famous			0
' it might also leave him with brain damage but for now , little @entity13 and thousands like him will continue to risk life and limb in the boxing ring			1
see the whole story in @entity209 , tonight at 7.30pm on @entity210 knock out : many fights end in a brain - bruising knock out with some left unconscious for up to a minute			2
