i did n't need anyone to tell me that but i did n't do anything about it			2
' i got bigger and bigger , and i was completely addicted to fatty foods			0
i could n't resist tucking into a @entity52 's or a full @entity29 , i really enjoyed eating them			2
i also enjoyed a few glasses of wine whenever i ate at the pub and would always have a pudding			0
' @entity4 's efforts saw her drop eight dress sizes			1
over the course of seven months she documented her progress on @entity62 and soon had people contacting her from around the world asking for advice she added : ' then i became really miserable			0
i could n't fit into any of my nice dresses and i had to start buying really unattractive clothes			1
' but the reality of her weight gain only hit @entity4 when her son , @entity71 , now 14 , could not fit his arms around her to give her a hug for his @entity75 presents			1
' @entity75 2011 was the turning point in my life			1
i could n't even get up a set of stairs without gasping for breath , ' she said			1

@entity75 is supposed to be a happy time and there i was bawling my eyes out			1
' @entity4 , who is also also mother to @entity84 , 20 , and @entity85 , 17 , said : ' my husband @entity86 and the kids were horrified that i was crying on @entity75 and were desperate to comfort me			1
i stared at myself in the mirror and could n't believe that i had let myself get this big			2
' but that shock was enough , it gave me the kick i needed and i vowed to change my life and lose weight			2
i did n't want the kids to end up like me			2
' @entity4 can now wear bikinis and fitted size 8 - 10 dresses - and can even fit into one of the legs of a pair of trousers that she used to wear before her weight loss @entity4 swapped takeaways and chocolate for porridge , salad , chicken and vegetables			1
she joined a local boot camp in the @entity111 and pushed herself so hard during workouts every week that she would be sick @entity4 , pictured at her heaviest , said the turning point came when her youngest son could n't fit his arms around her for a @entity75 hug but her hard work paid off and she soon dropped eight dress sizes			1
over the course of seven months she documented her progress on @entity62 and soon had people contacting her from around the world asking for advice			0
she said : ' losing weight was really hard work and it was difficult to stick at it			2
' my body would ache of the end of the sessions and i really missed eating chocolate , but it 's all been worth it			0
' a slimmer @entity4 can now wear bikinis and fitted size 8 - 10 dresses - and can even fit into one of the legs of a pair of trousers that she used to wear before her weight loss			1
but the determined mother did n't just stop there			0
she decided to quit her job and launch her own personal training company , @entity147 , in a bid to help others struggling to lose weight			1
speaking about her business venture , she said : ' i took a massive gamble , i quit my job and signed up to do a personal training course			1
but the risk paid off as i am now doing something that i absolutely love as well as running a successful business			0
' i 'm always at the gym now , and it is amazing to see other people progressing and watching the weight drop off them			0
' @entity4 , who trains and holds classes at @entity164 fitness club in @entity165 , is now focusing her efforts on body - building and plans to enter competitions later in the year			2
she said : ' now the next step for me is body building			0
' i want to tone up and build up muscle and eventually enter myself into competitions			0
i 've already made a start and i lift weights about three or four times a week , which is tough but i know i can do it			0
' she added : ' @entity86 and the boys are so proud of me and i feel incredible			0
i have so much confidence and want others to feel like that			0
it 's a struggle , me of all people should know that but i always tell my clients if i can do it , so can you			0
