by @entity0 @entity1 , former head of an infamous crime family , has lost a @entity4 battle after a judge has rejected his claims he was too poor to pay back debts from his days of crime the head of an infamous crime family has lost a @entity4 battle after a judge rejected his claims he was ' poncing off his wife ' and was too poor to pay back debts from his days of crime			1
@entity15 , the former boss of the north @entity17 gang , argued he was too poor to meet a £ 650,000 - plus debt			1
he told mrs justice @entity19 , sitting in @entity20 , that he was so poor that he felt ' like a ponce ' living off his actress wife @entity22			1
he also denied having hidden assets that were funding a luxury lifestyle			1
mrs @entity25 recently appeared in @entity26 n’t wot they used @entity28 at the @entity29 , @entity29			0
@entity15 applied to the judge for a ' certificate of inadequacy ' to show that he lacked funds to meet his crime - linked debts - a preliminary step to getting them reduced or written off			2
but the @entity37 ( @entity37 ) opposed his application and said there was ' a strong case ' that @entity15 possessed ' substantial undisclosed assets ' that continued to fund a luxury lifestyle			1
the @entity37 told the @entity4 that @entity44 and @entity25 ’ average ' identifiable ' spending in the three years from september 2010 - 2013 was £ 97,000 per annum - ' nearly four times the national average '			2
the @entity37 said the type of spending was ' inconsistent ' with her husband ’s claim of having no assets and of being reliant on friends and family loans for living expenses			2
the @entity37 gave as examples mrs @entity25 spending £ 12,044 on dental treatment and £ 2,500 on a dietary programme during three months in 2013			0
in june 2010 she bought a spa membership at a @entity20 country club for £ 3,850			0
the couple also spent nearly £ 15,000 on flights , hotels , restaurants and entertainment from august 2009 to september 2013			0
another £ 5,351 had gone on parking charges , fines , and the congestion charge			0
dismissing his application for a certificate , the judge said she was ' not satisfied that @entity15 has provided full and frank disclosure to the court ' of the assets ' which fund his life and that of his wife '			1
judge @entity78 refused @entity15 permission to appeal against her decision			2
@entity15 owes the balance of a confiscation order of £ 750,000 imposed after his conviction at @entity85 in 2007 for conspiring to conceal the proceeds of criminal conduct over a six - year period			1
the trial judge said he had accumulated a ' considerable fortune ' from his life as ' a highly successful career criminal ' over a ' significant ' period of time			0
he told mrs justice @entity19 , sitting in @entity20 , that he was so poor that he felt ' like a ponce ' living off his actress wife @entity94 ( pictured at an earlier hearing ) mrs @entity25 ( second left ) recently appeared in @entity96 at the @entity29 , @entity29 described in the courts as once heading one of the most feared organised criminal gangs in the @entity100 , he was also ordered to pay prosecution costs of £ 50,000 and the £ 4.6 million bill for his publicly funded defence			1
today the @entity4 rejected his claim that he was too poor to pay up on the confiscation order			1
the judge said that , when she heard his application at a three - day hearing in july , the amount outstanding on the order was £ 651,611 , and interest was accruing at the rate of £ 83 a day			2
dismissing his plea for a certificate of inadequacy , she said : ' i believe that there are financial matters known peculiarly to @entity119 which are not before the court			0
' upon the evidence presented to the court on behalf of the applicant , i am not satisfied that the current assets of @entity119 are worth less than the outstanding balance of the confiscation order			1
accordingly this application is refused			0
' barrister @entity128 said on @entity15 ’ behalf that he could not meet the confiscation order and added : ' he has committed crime and paid his price to society			1
' mr @entity128 said @entity15 became bitter after @entity133 bugged his former @entity20 home for almost two years , recording the most intimate moments of his private life , including the sounds of him making love with his wife			2
mr @entity128 told the judge : ' you may have felt that mr @entity15 is a somewhat bitter man			0
rightly or wrongly , to put up with , or learn that , everything you said to your family and friends has been pored over by the authorities must make a person bitter			0
dismissing his application for a certificate , the judge said she was ' not satisfied that @entity15 has provided full and frank disclosure to the court ' of the assets ' which fund his life and that of his wife ' ' this is a man who has been living in a goldfish bowl			1
there is no element of his life that has not been exposed to the authorities			0
' he rejected accusations that mrs @entity25 had been involved in the staging of sham loans			0
he suggested the @entity37 case was ' guesswork ' and @entity15 ’ claim of poverty was genuine			2
after today ’s ruling , the @entity37 said the order against @entity15 , with interest , was ' now worth £ 653,947.74 ' - and steps would be taken to ensure that he met the debt and to show ' crime does n’t pay '			1
the @entity37 said that , following the sale of his home in north @entity20 in 2009 , @entity15 paid the court £ 234,166.21 and another £ 130,323.43 following the sale of other assets			1
in seeking to have the confiscation order reduced , it was @entity15 ’s case that his current assets were worth less than the outstanding balance of the confiscation order			1
the @entity37 said : ' he claimed that he and his wife were living on expenses of £ 200 per week , paying rent of £ 250 and living on £ 23,000 - £ 24,000 per annum			1
' however , visits to the @entity191 and expensive meals out , spa memberships at luxurious hotels , high cost dental treatments and other treatments at private clinics all indicated a very different lifestyle			0
' @entity194 , head of the @entity195 of @entity196 , said : ' through a series of nefarious means , @entity15 has consistently sought to hide the proceeds of his crimes			0
' however , today ’s judgment is proof of our determination to see that crime does n’t pay and that those who seek to hide their wealth will be challenged and held to account			0
' mr @entity15 argued that he could n’t afford to pay what he owed and yet his lavish lifestyle showed this was not the case			2
' i ’m pleased that , presented with our carefully gathered evidence , the judge has decided that mr @entity15 does , in fact , have the ability to pay and has assets that he has not put before the court			2
' we will now work hard to ensure that mr @entity15 pays his confiscation order			1
' mr @entity194 said many criminals ' go to extraordinary lengths to avoid paying what is owed under confiscation orders , such as applying to the @entity4 to write off debt and hiding their assets			2
' depriving criminals of their ill - gotten gains disrupts organised crime and the new @entity232 is leading this fight across the country			0
' dedicated prosecutors will work tirelessly with investigators to claw back assets from those who seek to benefit from their crimes			0
' head of the @entity241 ’s @entity240 , @entity242 , said : ' today ’s judgment shows the real value of lifetime management and especially ancillary orders such as financial reporting orders ( @entity248 )			0
' @entity15 ’ @entity248 remains in force until 2017 and his confiscation order will continue to incur interest until it is settled			1
the @entity241 , in partnership with the @entity37 , will monitor both these orders very closely			0
