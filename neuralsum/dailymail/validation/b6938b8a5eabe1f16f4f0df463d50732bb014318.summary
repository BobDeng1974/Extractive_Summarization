' we wish now to draw a line under this tragedy			0
' we are extremely disappointed , the way the @entity3 have handled the events surrounding the death of @entity0			2
' the owners said they would have welcomed ' expert advice ' with how to deal with the situation and the ensuing press attention			0
they added : ' that would have been helpful , rather than the cold , impersonal emails and their own press comments regretting that @entity0 had died after the show			1
' @entity0 became ill when he returned to the @entity66 home in the city of @entity15 , in @entity16			2

@entity3 secretary @entity112 said : ' there has been a lot of concern about whether the poisoning happened at @entity1 and we are now able to reassure all dog - lovers who came to @entity1 that this could not have been possible			2
' it is highly likely that the poisons , thought to be on a piece of beef , were eaten in @entity16 , shortly before @entity0 's death			2
' they said the poisons - identified as carbofuran and aldicarb - were fast acting and severe symptoms would have set in two to three hours after them being eaten			2
@entity0 belonged to the @entity130 ' son @entity129 who was very close to the three - year - old @entity8 setter @entity133 is pictured with @entity0 as a puppy among a large litter of @entity8 setters owned by his parents aldicarb and carbofuran are insecticides which are used in agriculture - but are not approved for use in the @entity143			1
@entity144 , senior information scientist for @entity145 , said : ' we would expect the clinical effects , if ingested by a dog , to be rapid in onset ; normally between half an hour and three hours			0
' after this time a combination of clinical effects , if the toxins were taken in sufficient quantities , would likely be present , including weakness , collapse , diarrhoea , slow heart rate , difficulty in breathing and excessive salivation			0
' the comments from the @entity3 about the poison were made after fears were raised that six dogs had fallen ill after performing at the dog show			1
there is no evidence to suggest any were poisoned at @entity1 and the @entity3 said there had never been a confirmed case of poisoning in the show 's 124 - year history			1

' both we and the owners have expressed our desire to draw a line under this , so that the owners can grieve privately , ' she added			0
' the only way the truth about who poisoned @entity0 and whether or not it was intentional can possibly now come out is via a police investigation			0
' @entity0 was cremated last week at a special centre for family pets twenty miles from the family hom in @entity16			0
the @entity34 said they brought his ashes home and plan to spread them in the coming weeks in woods near their home where he liked to walk			0
