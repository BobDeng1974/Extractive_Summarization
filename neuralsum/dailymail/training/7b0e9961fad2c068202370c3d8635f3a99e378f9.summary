the internet lit up with buzz about @entity3 player @entity2 starting friday over claims the forward had been too forward with a female sideline reporter			1
at the close of a pregame sideline interview , @entity2 planted an impromptu kiss on @entity10 then quickly walked out of camera frame			1
@entity12 brushed it off and finished her segment , but some media outlets have since condemned @entity2 's behavior as unsportsmanlike and much worse			1
that could be a mortifying thing for this reporter			0
' @entity2 , who went on to help lead the @entity3 to a 108 - 103 victory against the @entity35 , started out the interview innocently enough			1
he grinned sheepishly several times before calling @entity12 by the wrong name as he answered one of her questions			2
' see ball , get ball			0
you know how i do it , @entity45 , ' he said			1
a little rattled : @entity12 finished up her segment with a red face , but managed to sign off with her dignity intact then came a wink and then the now - infamous smooch before @entity2 left the camera frame			1
@entity12 's face reddened noticeably as she signed off with a joke			0
' he also said he goes off the feel of the game , just like he does with interviews i guess , ' said the shocked reporter			0
but , just as soon as the backlash against @entity2 began , @entity12 herself put a stop it			2
she tweeted on monday about as much of an explanation for @entity2 's behavior as we 're likely to get any time soon : ' hey fans @ @entity74 thing was inside joke & not a big deal			2
we have a good working relationship			0
' inside joke ? @entity12 tweeted what will have to suffice to viewers as an explanation			0
