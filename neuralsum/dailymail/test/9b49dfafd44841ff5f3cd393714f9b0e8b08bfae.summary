there is an insufficient supply of whooping cough vaccine in @entity3 , according to @entity4			1
however , medical professionals insist the resource shortage will not affect the immunisation programs for babies , children and pregnant women			1
it comes less than a month after the death of 32 - day - old @entity13 who died after contracting whooping cough			1
his parents @entity18 and @entity19 are now leading a campaign , urging adults to vaccinate themselves and their children to prevent more infant deaths from the terrible disease			1
the adult whooping cough vaccine will not be available in @entity3 until july , according to @entity26			1
however , although whooping cough is less severe in adults , infected adults do pose a serious risk for infants and children who are not vaccinated			1
' we have sufficient stocks to vaccinate children as part of the school - based vaccination program			1
' on march 15 , two days before baby @entity13 died , his mother @entity18 posted a devastating photo of her son wrapped up in a blanket in his hospital bed urging people to get themselves and their children immunised against whooping cough			1
' if you have n't been immunised against whooping cough ( pertussis ) please consider getting it done			2
' heartbreaking to watch 4 week old @entity13 struggle with it at ( @entity76 's @entity75 )			0
please keep him in your thoughts ! , ' she wrote			0
' if you 're anti-immunisation / anti-logic / anti-duty of care to your society as a whole , then feel free to take a look at this picture of my son in hospital right now at 4 weeks old with whooping cough - and then come and tell me how you think immunisation is a bad thing , ' @entity13 's father @entity19 added			1
dr @entity94 could not confirm why the shortage has taken place but told @entity26 that it is not abnormal			0
his mother @entity40 posted a brave tribute to her baby boy and thanked @entity76 's @entity75 for doing ' everything they could to save his little life ' ' i do n't know whether it 's because of increased demand in the world or if it 's another issue , but there are vaccination shortages from time to time , ' he said			0
' there are other preparations on the market [ and ] they 're not all in short supply			0
' for people opting to be vaccinated against whooping cough , they may be deferred by their gp until more supplies are available			2
' these people can return when supplies are again available , ' dr @entity119 told @entity26			0
infectious diseases expert at @entity123 , @entity124 , told @entity125 : ' from my point of view immunisation is wonderful particularly for whooping cough			1
' he explained infants are ' at a high risk of dying if they get infected ' and that the death rate from whooping cough in infants under 6 months of age is about 1 per cent			2
' it 's important to listen to the experts , ' mr @entity124 said			0
' whooping cough is lethal in babies and in adults people can be absent from work for the persistent cough , it 's a nasty infection			1
' whooping cough ( also known as ' pertussis ' ) is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the lungs and airways			2
the government health website says the disease is ' highly infectious and most serious in babies under the age of 12 months '			1
babies are at greatest risk of infection until they can have at least two doses of the vaccine ( minimum 4 months old ) as the mother 's antibodies do not provide reliable protection			2
it 's very rare for children who have been immunised against whooping cough to get the disease â€“ and if they do , it 's usually not as serious			1
symptoms the condition usually begins with a persistent dry and irritating cough that progresses to intense bouts of coughing			0
these are followed by a distinctive ' whooping ' noise , which is how the condition gets its name			0
the early symptoms of whooping cough are often similar to those of a common cold and may include : these early symptoms of whooping cough can last for one to two weeks , before becoming more severe			2
the second stage of whooping cough is often called the paroxysmal stage and is characterised by intense bouts of coughing			2
each bout of coughing usually lasts between one and two minutes			0
infants younger than six months may not make the ' whoop ' sound after coughing , but they may start gagging or gasping , and may temporarily stop breathing			0
information supplied by @entity189 in 2013 , the @entity191 report said that despite a long - standing immunisation program , ' pertussis remains highly prevalent in @entity3 and the least well controlled of all vaccine - preventable diseases '			1
' epidemics occur every 3 to 4 years			0
in unvaccinated populations , these outbreaks can be very large			0
in vaccinated populations , outbreaks are smaller , with greatly reduced mortality and morbidity , and may continue to occur every 3 to 4 years or be more widely spaced , ' the report said			0
the devastated parents have set up a @entity45 page that already has over 25,000 likes			0
