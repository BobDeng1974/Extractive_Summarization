by @entity0 road trips always seem like a good idea at the time , but several hours of sitting in a hot , sticky car can be enough to dampen anyone ’s spirits			0
now , a new gadget could mean drivers have a way to freshen up ‘ @entity9 ’ - whether they ’re travelling through the desert or stuck on the motorway			0
the £ 125 ( $ 210 ) system , named the ' @entity13 ; provides a hot power shower using a 5ft ( 1.5m ) long pressurised tank fitted to the roof of a car			1
attached to the tank is 55in ( 139cm ) hose , which means users can also wash equipment such as bikes or surfboards			2
the man behind the idea is @entity38 - based @entity37 , who had what he describes as a ‘ eureka ’ moment while exploring the 120 mile ( 193km ) @entity42 in @entity44 's @entity43			0
mr @entity37 , 58 , said : ‘ we would ride into camp looking dusty , dirty and sweaty			0
attached to the tank is 55 inch ( 139cm ) hose , which means users can also wash equipment such as bikes or surfboards			2
the nozzle can be set to one of its seven settings which include shower , jet and mist the @entity13 uses the renewable energy from the sun which heats the black surface of the tank and warms the water inside			1
the tank can hold five gallons ( 19 litres ) of liquid			1
once it is filled , users can pressurise the tank by inflating air into it using a bike pump - allowing it to project water up to 60ft ( 18m )			1
the nozzle can be set to one of its seven settings which include shower , jet and mist			0
attached to the tank is 55in ( 139cm ) hose , which means users can also wash equipment such as bikes or surfboards ‘ we would try using solar shower bags but there was nowhere to hang them , the water would drip out and it was n't warm			1
‘ as a result , i 've spent the last seven years developing a shower that heats up while you drive - and came up with a rack mounted pressured solar shower			0
’ the @entity13 has no solar panels but uses the renewable energy from the sun which heats the black surface and warms the water inside			1
the tank can hold five gallons ( 19 litres ) of liquid			1

currently , the @entity117 is the only rack mounted portable solar shower on the market and for those seeking privacy , shower mr @entity37 said curtains can be sourced elsewhere			0
the tank can hold five gallons ( 19 litres ) of liquid			1
once it is filled , users can pressurise the water by inflating air using a pump through a valve - allowing it to project water up to 60ft ( 18m )			1
it even allows space for a bicycle rack to be attached he added that if the temperature is below 21 ° c , it wo n't be very effective at heating water			2
mr @entity37 , a retired computer science professor from @entity139 , said : ‘ people have given us some puzzled looks when they see others ' showering			0
‘ but a full tank should be able to do three showers if you turn it off while soaping			2
’ ‘ you can also clip the hose to the side of the shower and turn the nozzle on so you do n't have to hold the nozzle while showering			2
‘ considering my first model was made from @entity158 , acrylic glass and an aluminium bike tray , it 's come a long way			0

@entity166 can hold five gallons ( *19l* ) of water which is heated by the sun
users can pressurise the tank by inflating air into it using a bike pump , allowing it to project water up to 60ft ( 18m )
