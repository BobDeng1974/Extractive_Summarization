by @entity0 @entity1 voted in the first ' @entity3 ' election today , although polls suggest the allure of the ruling @entity6 as the conqueror of apartheid will prevail even among those with no memory of white - minority rule			1
an estimated one million @entity1 who were born after the end of apartheid will be voting in the elections , which are the first since the death of @entity16 in december			1
opinion polls suggest there is no doubt about the overall result , with @entity6 support estimated at around 65 per cent , only a shade lower than the 65.9 per cent it won in the 2009 election that brought president @entity25 to power			1
they close at 7pm bst and a firm idea of the outcome should be available by noon tomorrow			0
the resilience of @entity6 support has surprised analysts who a year ago were saying it could struggle at the polls as its glorious past recedes into history and voters focus instead on the sluggish economic growth and slew of scandals that have typified @entity25 's first term			1
@entity1 's most sophisticated economy has struggled to recover from a 2009 recession - its first since the 1994 demise of apartheid - and the @entity6 's efforts to stimulate growth and tackle 25 percent unemployment have been hampered by powerful unions			1
@entity1 's top anti-graft agency accused @entity25 this year of ' benefitting unduly ' from a $ 23million state - funded security upgrade to his private home at @entity80 in rural @entity81 that included a swimming pool and chicken run			1
his personal approval ratings have dipped since the findings by @entity86			0
patient : @entity1 voters queue at a polling station in @entity90 , north of @entity32			2
the outcome of the election is expected by noon on thursday early start : @entity1 stand in line against the sunrise to cast their vote at a polling station in @entity97 dark moment : @entity1 queue up to vote at a polling station that was burned down overnight , but a tent was erected in the morning in the politically - sensitive mining town of @entity103 but at a news conference this week to conclude the @entity6 election campaign , the 72 - year - old brushed aside suggestions the imbroglio was damaging the party			1
' i 'm not worried about @entity80 , ' @entity25 said			2
' the people are not worried about it			0
i think the people who are worried about it is you guys , the media , and the opposition			0
' besides being easy fodder for the cartoonists who have revelled in the freedom of speech enshrined in the post-apartheid constitution , @entity80 has exposed the gulf between current and former @entity6 leaders , in particular @entity16 , @entity1 's first black president , who died in december			1
it has also become the rallying cry for those who feel the dominance of the @entity6 as it enters its third decade in power has corrupted the soul of the 102 - year - old former liberation movement			1
bright start : @entity1 wrap up against the early morning chill while queuing to vote in the restive @entity103 township people form a long queue as they wait to cast their votes in an informal settlement in @entity136 in an election that is expected to keep president @entity25 in power braving the chill : people form a long queue to cast their ballot in the township of @entity144 on the outskirts of @entity146 choosing her party : a woman leaves a polling station after casting her ballot for the general election at the @entity153 ' it is not necessarily the huge sum paid by the public that is the most corrupt aspect of @entity25 's palatial rural estate , ' the @entity155 newspaper said in an editorial this week			1
' it is how voraciously this wretched business has sucked in so many others : ministers , bureaucrats , party officials and , as the election hots up , ordinary loyalists			0
' barring a major upset , the stock market and rand should take the vote in their stride and could even gain if @entity1 's reputation for stability relative to other emerging markets such as @entity177 , @entity178 or @entity179 is affirmed			2
' overall , the election is reassuringly boring , ' said @entity181 , an economist at @entity182 in @entity32			0
' we know who 's going to win and we know there are not going to be any radical policy changes			0
' @entity1 nobel peace laureate , archbishop emeritus @entity189 , and his wife @entity190 react after casting their ballot at a polling station in @entity194 , @entity146 edging ever closer : residents of @entity196 queue to vote for the general elections at the @entity153 secondary school front of the queue : voters make their way into a tent erected in @entity204			2
the resilience of @entity6 support has surprised analysts who a year ago were saying it could struggle at the polls a woman registers to vote for the general election in @entity204 as an armed guard stands nearby			2
@entity6 support is estimated at around 65 per cent the @entity6 's nearest rival , the @entity213 , polled 16.7 per cent nationwide in 2009 and , even though it has been gaining ground , is still seen too much as the political home of privileged whites to have mass appeal			2
instead , the most spirited challenge has come from the ultra-leftist @entity219 ( @entity219 ) led by expelled @entity222 leader @entity221 , who models himself on @entity226 's @entity225 , right down to the jaunty red beret			0
in his final rally at a @entity97 soccer stadium , @entity221 , who wants to nationalise banks and mines and seize white - owned farms without compensation , lambasted everything from the @entity80 issue to foreign investors and former colonial powers			1
set to retain power : @entity1 president and leader of the @entity6 , @entity25 , casts his vote in @entity244 , rural @entity81 province inspiration : the elections are the first since the death of anti-apartheid hero @entity16 ( pictured with his wife @entity249 , left , and ex - wife @entity250 at his 86th birthday in 2004 ) ' @entity252 must know that we 're not scared of the queen , ' he said to thunderous applause from the 30,000 - strong crowd			1
' therefore , we shall not report to @entity252			0
we will report to the people			0
the people of @entity1 will decide how business is conducted in @entity1			2
' however , even the @entity219 's noisy emergence is likely to have minimal overall impact , with polls putting its support at 4 - 5 per cent			0
but of 1.9 million ' @entity3 ' voters aged 18 - 19 - its key constituency - only one in three is registered			0
the silver - tongued @entity221 himself is also likely to barred from public office this month if a court confirms a provisional sequestration order imposed in february because of 16 million rand ( $ 1.4 million ) owed in unpaid taxes .			0
