@entity7 , 28 , overcame a crippling spinal condition , that left her in a wheelchair , to walk down the aisle the mother - of - three worked with a personal trainer and began lifting tiny weights but was soon pulling off squats , bench presses and bicep curls as her symptoms eased			1
in just six months she shed a staggering 10 dress sizes - as her growing strength combated her illness			1
and to the delight of her family she proudly walked down the aisle on the arm of her father , @entity37 , as she married her partner , @entity38 , 34 , in december last year			0
mrs @entity7 said : ‘ it was amazing to be able to walk down the aisle - i nearly ran it			1
‘ i had no pain whatsoever and felt so confident			0
my gp is completely amazed and ca n’t believe the difference in me			0
‘ my condition got so severe , it would hurt if i sneezed or moved my toes			0
i needed assistance for everything , even moving in bed			0

‘ i no longer have any pain and have come off my medication - and it ’s all down to pumping iron			2

the rare disease causes cysts to grow in the spinal cord - these can eventually damage it and leave the sufferer paralysed			1
the condition became so severe she was confined to a wheelchair and needed 24 - hour care			1
she piled on the pounds to become a size 22 because the condition left her unable to take any exercise when she got engaged , she decided to try and improve her health so she started going to the gym			1
starting with very small weights , she gradually built up her strength symptoms usually develop slowly over time and include muscle weakness , decreased sensitivity to pain , loss of reflexes , stiffness , pain and numbness			1
it is not known exactly what causes it but it can result from meningitis , spinal cord tumours and injuries			2
mrs @entity7 underwent two major spinal operations , including one to drain fluid from a cyst in her spine , but her body became frail and ballooned to a size 22 because of the lack of exercise			2
at the height of her illness she was forced to endure regular painkilling injections and was on a daily cocktail of tablets , patches and injections			0
mrs @entity7 says that as a result of her workouts she is no longer in pain and is able to walk again mrs @entity7 said : ' my condition got so severe , it would hurt if i sneezed or moved my toes			1
i needed assistance for everything , even moving in bed ' she decided to try the bodybuilding approach after agreeing to marry mr @entity38 - and now intends to keep up her training for life because it ’s the only thing keeping her condition at bay			2

‘ i feel like it ’s saved my life			0
i can do everything i want with my kids and am able to get the most out of life			0
before taking up bodybuilding , mrs @entity7 had to undergo two major spinal operations and she took a cocktail of drugs every day but these treatments failed to remove her pain or muscle weakness mrs @entity7 said : ' i 've gone from needing 24 - hour care and being pushed in a wheelchair to training twice a day six times a week ' ‘ i was determined not to let my children grow up watching me in pain and unable to move			1
’ mrs @entity7 sought help from top personal trainer @entity158 , who specialises in training bodybuilders on how to eat healthily and get into shape for contests			2
@entity158 , based in @entity163 , @entity164 , said : ‘ @entity7 is one of the most dedicated people i ’ve dealt with			0
