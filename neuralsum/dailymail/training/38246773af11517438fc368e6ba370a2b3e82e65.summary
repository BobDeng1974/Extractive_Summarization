by @entity0 published : 11:41 est , 6 march 2013 updated : 04:55 est , 7 march 2013 an advert that uses the ' @entity3 ' internet craze to raise awareness of @entity5 has sparked controversy because it features a sufferer staggering about as the music plays			1
the @entity10 @entity9 released the video , called ' @entity12 ' , that shows society chairman @entity13 , who did not take his medication in order to make the video , shaking out of control in an office kitchen while the song @entity3 by @entity21 plays			1
the video imitates the @entity3 internet meme , which are short videos typically beginning with one person gently bopping alone for the first 15 seconds while everyone else in the room ignores them			1
then the bass line drops and everyone goes wild , doing crazy dance moves around the room			2
@entity9 chairman @entity13 ( right ) starts shaking as the music plays in this version , when the bass drops , mr @entity13 collapses and people in the office rush to help him			1
the clip , created by advertising agency @entity42 , ends with slogan : ' shaking , fun for some â€¦ daily struggle for others			1
' a statement on the charity 's website said : ' with this the society and its chairman want to show that @entity5 's is much more than a shaking hand or foot			1
' the intention of the video is that it shocks the viewer , because a lot of people do n't know what the daily reality of @entity5 's is			1
' online observers were mixed about the video			1
some felt it was in poor taste , but many others felt it was a bold and effective way of spreading awareness of the condition			1
@entity71 user @entity69 , posted : ' this is horrible ' , while @entity72 said : ' so , i have @entity5 ( @entity5 ) and my father died from same a year ago last saturday			2
i ca n't even ... ' some say the publicity stunt is tasteless , but others defended it as a clever and memorable way of showing what the disease does to people collapse : the video ends with mr @entity13 falling to the floor , before his colleagues come rushing to his aid message : the society says it wants to challenge the misconception that @entity5 's is simply a shaking hand or foot however , miss @entity93 said : ' i do n't understand how people feel that this is making fun of people with @entity5 ( @entity5 ) when people with @entity5 obviously participated in making it			1
are they not allowed to do anything except be tragic all the time ? ' another , called @entity105 , said : ' wait			2
when did it become offensive for a disease advocacy group to demonstrate the effects of that disease ? ' the video has since been removed because of copyright issues with the music company that owns the rights to the song used			1
the @entity3 was created by a group of teenage boys on the @entity117 of @entity118			2
@entity5 is a chronic neurological disorder			2
people with the condition do n't have enough of a chemical called dopamine because some nerve cells in their brain have died			0
this affects the way the brain co-ordinates the movements of the muscles in different parts of the body			0
the disease mainly develops in the over 50s			0
about 5 in 1,000 people in their 60s , and about 40 in 1,000 people in their 80s have the condition			0
the main symptoms are slowness of movement , stiffness of muscles and shaking			1
these tend to slowly worsen with time although the rate varies from patient to patient			0
the condition is diagnosed from the symptoms shown by the patient			0
it also increases your risk of dementia			0
about half of people with @entity5 develop dementia at some stage			0
@entity160 is also common among sufferers			0
there is currently no cure			0
drugs and physiotherapy can treat symptoms			0
there have also been recent promising trials using deep brain stimulation			0
