@entity1 's viewers accused the @entity2 of ' new depths of dumbing down ' last night after it interviewed the @entity4 contestant forced off the show when his @entity7 collapsed			1
presenter @entity8 and baker @entity9 both wore aprons in the three minute segment as they discussed the scandal and ate some of the 31 - year - old 's best cakes			1
the bearded baker lost his cool when his ice cream filled pudding melted after rival contestant @entity20 took it out of the freezer - leading mr @entity9 to throw it in the bin			1
the controversy whipped up anger among viewers who accused mrs @entity20 , 69 , of sabotaging the pudding , and led to @entity9 ' his exit from the show			1
but furious @entity1 fans rushed to criticise the decision to feature the story on the @entity2 's flagship current affairs show and said standards have slipped since @entity34 left this summer			1
controversial : the melting of @entity36 enthralled millions of @entity37 off fans this week but @entity1 viewers turned on the show and said it should never have been featured critique : people took to @entity42 the highlight the ' dumbing down ' of the @entity2 's flagship news show yesterday the @entity2 's former editorial boss @entity45 said the programme ’s under - fire editor @entity46 is struggling to recover from the departure of its main presenter in june			1
@entity34 's own parting shot after 25 years at the helm was that the show was ' made by 13 - year - olds ' and its producers were ' idealists ' on a ' fool ’s errand '			0
@entity1 's has lost five per cent of its viewers in the past year			1
@entity59 tweeted : ' how many additional viewers has # @entity1 put on since it began dumbing down			1
last night featured ' interview ' with @entity37 off contestant ! @entity63 tweeted : ' so @entity64 's invading @entity65 , our own country could split within the month , and are interviewing the bloke from the @entity69			2
@entity70 said : ' @entity9 from @entity37 off on @entity1 , whilst over on @entity72 @entity71 is discussing the @entity65 invasion with the @entity64 foreign minister			1
@ @entity75 tweeted : ' @entity46 ( sic ) from @entity69 is on @entity1 tonight			1
how i wish @entity34 were still there			0
his contempt , harnessed , could power a small @entity80 village '			0
@entity81 said : newsnight doing a segment on a @entity4 controversy - i imagine @entity34 crying and laughing while stabbing a sponge cake			0
he added : ' @entity8 : " how many people died in @entity86 today ? ! blimey			1
anyway , have you edited that segment on the baked alaska yet ? " criticisms : viewers and experts have said that @entity1 has struggled @entity93 wrote : ' @entity1 , the gritty , hard hitting news show covering @entity97 controversies '			1
@entity4 said : ' # bingate is being featured in tonight 's @entity1 ? ! bake off is still about cake right ? did n't change to politics did it ? ' away from @entity1 the melting of @entity36 has enthralled fans			1
@entity4 contestant @entity20 has revealed she left the show but not because of the ice cream pudding controversy , because she lost her sense of smell and taste when she fainted			1
but mrs @entity20 , 69 , said she wept as she claimed the corporation had cast her as the villain , deliberately editing the show to make it look as if she had left the dessert out of the freezer for several minutes			0
the scandal is the biggest to hit @entity37 off since last year ’s @entity117 drama , when one contestant tearfully admitted taking another ’s custard to use in a trifle			2
getting to the soggy bottom of the baked @entity97 incident , however , was proving rather more difficult last night			0
popular : the @entity69 had more than eight million viewers on wednesday night - but the 590,000 who watch @entity1 were less interested massive scandal : @entity9 threw his soupy @entity7 ( pictured ) in the bin in a fit of frozen meringue pique the story starts on wednesday when 8million viewers watched bearded @entity9 , 31 , throw a wobbly when he found his dessert had been reduced to a splodge after mrs @entity20 took it out of the freezer			1
he was eliminated after he presented it in a bin to judges @entity136 and @entity138 , then stormed off set			0
that led to mrs @entity20 , from @entity141 , being pilloried as a cheat in cruel online comments			0
there were more than 550 complaints to the @entity2			0
she , however , insisted the recording had been edited to make it seem as if she had left the meringue and ice cream dessert out for minutes , rather than seconds			0
‘ they deliberately misled viewers and exploited me for the sake of entertainment , ’ she said			2
‘ the @entity2 should be ashamed			0
‘ the cake was out of the freezer for 40 seconds and i was asking who it belonged to			0
then @entity9 walked over and took it away			1
it happened as simply as that			0
‘ @entity9 did n’t blame me at all			1
i was very disappointed and upset by how they cleverly edited the show and as a result i have people saying all sorts of nasty things about me			0
’ a @entity2 spokesman said : ' the " @entity168 " saga was a much talked about episode , leading to a huge audience reaction and prominent coverage across national newspapers and online , including the @entity174			0
' @entity1 approached @entity9 directly to secure his first interview about what happened behind the scenes and subsequently since filming which gave our audiences an exclusive slice of the action			1
' @entity1 has been suffering falling viewing figures and increased criticism about its tone by viewers			1
last night it was its feature with a failed @entity69 contestant but last week it was a row about whether it had played into the hands of terrorists when it carried an interview with an @entity194 fanatic			2
the programme also got into hot water recently following its aborted investigation into @entity198 and false accusations it made against @entity200 , where he was wrongly accused of being a paedophile			0
it was also ridiculed when @entity8 did @entity204 's @entity203 routine on @entity205			2
argument : @entity46 said that @entity8 's @entity203 last year was not a signal of dumbing down former @entity2 boss @entity208 yesterday slammed the flagship current affairs show for trying to chase ratings rather than focus on ‘ intelligent viewers ’			1
he believes the show has n’t recovered from losing @entity34 ’s ‘ sense of theatre ’ , writing in the @entity215 , he said : ‘ it ’s possibly because of the grimness of the news agenda that i find myself ending the day with @entity220 ’s @entity1 less often than i used to			2
i admire the energy that @entity46 has brought to the role of editor , but there ’s a sense he could be flogging a dying horse			0
’ defence : under fire editor @entity46 says the show is more serious than at any time in its recent past before leaving @entity1 in june , @entity34 , 64 , admitted he sometimes felt like telling viewers to ‘ go to bed ’ because the programme had so little of value to say on slow news days			1
since @entity34 left , ratings have in fact risen by 17,000 , but still lag far behind the audiences it attracted ten years ago			2
the show has endured a torrid couple of years in the wake of the @entity198 scandal , after it emerged it had investigated the disgraced @entity245 ’s paedophilic past but failed to air its findings before his death			0
the following year , @entity1 came under further pressure when it wrongly identified former @entity249 treasurer @entity200 as a paedophile , prompting a £ 185,000 payout for damages			2
but mr @entity46 has persistently denied he has been dumbing down the show after he took over the @entity2 's flagship current affairs show			2
@entity1 has since hit the headlines thanks to @entity34 's interview with @entity257 , @entity8 dancing to @entity203 and @entity258 " interviewing " @entity259			1
but mr @entity46 told the @entity260 last year : ' any suggestion of dumbing down is painfully preposterous			0
@entity1 is more serious than at any time in its recent past			2
' the audience is improving from 605,000 in 2013 to routinely more than 700,000 and between 400,000 and 600,000 on thursday when we compete with @entity265			0
but we were knocking on a million when @entity34 interviewed @entity257			0
that 's a new and exciting way to do politics			0
' according to @entity268 : ' @entity1 has recorded an average consolidated audience of 590,100 ( 3.98 % ) from 2 september 2013 ( @entity46 ’s first episode ) to 30 april 2014 , compared with 623,300 ( 4.05 % ) over the same period in 2012/13 ' .			2
