motorists in @entity1 have been left bemused by ' @entity3 's most pointless lane ' - a bizarre road layout which is not even long enough for the buses it was built for			1
residents in @entity8 , @entity1 , say the ' pointless ' bus lane on @entity10 - which at 50ft long is not big enough for a double - decker - should never have been built			1
the quirk in the road means cars and vans are forced off a stretch of straight road and onto a narrow ' chicane - like ' bend in order to avoid breaking the law			2
residents in @entity8 , @entity1 , are asking why the ' pointless ' bus lane on @entity10 ( pictured ) which is just 50ft long and is not long enough for a double - decker bus , was built			1
they claim it is a ' hazard ' every week thousands of drivers have to make the awkward manoeuvre despite only a handful of buses being timetabled to come along the route each day			1
following a series of accidents , the lane has now been branded a ' hazard ' with motorists questioning what its purpose is			1
@entity38 , 24 , a hairdresser from nearby @entity39 , spotted the strange road layout when she was driving at the weekend			0
she said : ' it really is bizarre			0
i drove through it on the way to my mum 's house			0
' i found it so strange that i actually had to turn back and have another look to make sure i was not seeing things			0
the quirk in the road means cars are forced onto a narrow ' chicane - like ' bend in order to avoid the lane ' the bus lane is so short that it is pointless and i nearly bashed the alloys on my @entity59 when i went around the traffic islands			1
' people living near to road say there have been a series of accidents which they believe have been caused by cars struggling to get through the narrow layout as they avoid the bus lane			1
miss @entity38 added : ' i understand why we need bus lanes and i think they are a good idea normally but this has to be the most pointless one in the country			2
following a series of accidents the lane has been branded a ' hazard ' by motorists who use it every day ' i have shown pictures of it to my friends and they were all laughing and wondering what on earth its there for			1
' another driver , who asked not to be named , said : ' there is no obvious reason why it is here			0
' it 's very narrow so i assume the highways bosses think it is slowing cars down but it 's on a 30mph stretch of road here so it 's not as if motorists are driving fast along here			2
' i think it 's more likely to cause accidents rather than prevent them			0
' the bus drivers must find it very amusing as well			0
' a @entity107 spokesman said : ' at the time the bus lane was put in – in 2007 – the @entity8 village was suffering from @entity110 using @entity10 as a short cut to and from the nearby @entity112 and especially when the @entity113 and @entity115 southbound was jammed			1
' @entity10 had and still has safety speed restricting tables across the road width and it also has a number of aging houses close to the road , this lead to residents suffering noise , dirt and major vibration problems			0
' the installation of a bus gate of this type has effectively reduced hgv traffic while still allowing public transport access to and through the village			0
' the council has received no complaints from villagers about this bus gate in recent years			2
' thousands of drivers have to make the awkward manoeuvre despite only a handful of buses being timetabled			0
