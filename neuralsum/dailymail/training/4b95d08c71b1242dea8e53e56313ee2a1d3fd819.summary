by @entity0 football supporters do n't get managers sacked on their own but they can do their bit			0
@entity4 should be a little nervous to learn , therefore , that a minority of those on the @entity7 have this week discussed taking down the banner that hangs there in his honour			1
it wo n’t happen , of course			0
it would be a self - defeating , tasteless act and @entity16 ’s hard core support has more class than that			1
but as they funnel down sir @entity21 towards @entity22 before their team ’s @entity24 tie with @entity26 on wednesday night , a growing number already feel that ‘ @entity28 ’ has turned out to be ‘ the @entity27 ’			1
earlier on at the training ground , he smiled as @entity30 nutmegged him , even if the horseplay involving the @entity16 manager , @entity45 , @entity61 and @entity62 did look a little staged			1
' this club will rise again , ' said @entity4 , striking a rather dramatic tone			2
nevertheless , the mood on @entity67 ’s red half is dark			0
@entity16 supporters not old enough to remember that sir @entity69 was three years in to his tenure when supporters endeavoured to chase him out of town after a defeat to @entity74 in december 1989 are already convinced of @entity4 ’ unsuitability			1
for the first time in memory , journalists covering @entity16 have been criticised by supporters for being too ' soft ' on the manager			2
meanwhile , revelations in print on tuesday that the @entity16 board were encouraged by @entity22 ’s apparent support of @entity4 towards the end of sunday ’s humbling by @entity48 were quickly countered by many who claimed the spontaneous outbreak of singing was no more than an attempt to drown out the crowing coming from the away end			1
one in , one out : @entity93 ( left ) will hope to star for @entity16 but @entity94 ( right ) is ineligible for the tie main man : @entity16 will look for @entity62 to rediscover his shooting boots to keep their @entity99 dream alive under fire : @entity101 has struggled to cope with the step up in class since joining @entity16 eye on the ball : @entity105 has not scored at @entity22 since october all together now ? @entity16 put on a show of solidarity ahead of their clash with @entity26 in the mix : @entity4 was heavily involved in the training session as he forced the players to up the pace slim : @entity16 have a 7.1 per cent chance of overcoming @entity26 with a 3 - 0 win , says @entity116 this is a remarkable time in this great football town and as cocksure neighbours @entity119 prepare to come tearing round the corner for an @entity22 derby next tuesday , @entity4 can only hope that an unlikely @entity24 comeback gives him some unexpected breathing space tonight			1
' i think the support inside @entity22 has been phenomenal , ' said @entity4 on tuesday			2
' i ’ve told the players we need to give something back now , we need to start performing together			0
' we need to make sure that we work together to get a performance on the night to be remembered			0
' we ’ll leave nothing behind on the night hopefully and we ’ll try to make sure that we somehow get ourselves through to the next round			0
' asked the inevitable questions about his future , @entity4 did his best to talk of the long - term , mentioning once again fundamental concepts he feels need to be changed at a club , problems previously masked by @entity69 ’s individual and unique brilliance			1
can it get any worse ? @entity16 players trudge off after their defeat by @entity48 on sunday contrast : @entity144 celebrates during @entity48 's win as @entity16 's season lurches from one disaster to another nightmare : @entity4 faces a testing 10 days as he bids to salvage something from @entity16 's terrible season ' my future has n’t changed and we never discuss it , ' he said			1
' the biggest assurance is that the club let me get on with the job			0
' it is a familiar @entity4 theme and would deserve a more sympathetic audience if only his team ’s football showed some sign of improving			2
sadly , the manner of sunday ’s defeat to @entity48 has done nothing to inspire any kind of optimism as @entity16 try to overturn a 2 - 0 first leg deficit			1
@entity16 vice-captain @entity171 did his best to talk up his team - mates ’ chances tonight but even he was left without answers when asked exactly why a team of @entity177 champions have imploded almost overnight			1
' it ’s a difficult moment , ' said the @entity180 defender			1
focused : @entity16 defender @entity171 has described @entity16 's current plight as a ' difficult moment ' party time : @entity144 celebrates scoring at @entity22 as @entity48 thrash @entity16 spot on : @entity184 slots home the first of two penalties as @entity48 crushed their neighbours it ’s a new challenge for us because we have never been in this situation			1
but you have to show your character and personality			0
' when you put on the @entity16 shirt you know it ’s big story , a big pressure every year and this year is more difficult than a year ago			2
' we know we had a bad game in the first leg			0
i think even a three - year - old @entity16 fan has been hurting			2
' but in life you always have a second chance and we get it in this game			0
' i ’m still confident			0
we do n’t want to think about sunday , it ’s gone , the past is the past			0
' @entity16 will be without the cup - tied @entity94 against @entity26 a blessing given his recent moribund form			1
we can expect @entity52 to fill that hole and one of @entity211 and @entity212 to replace the tired - looking @entity93			0
from bad to worse : olympiacos take a 2 - 0 lead into the second leg at @entity22 on wednesday what can we do ? the @entity24 is @entity16 's last chance of a trophy this season certainly an early goal would help			1
on the fourteen occasions @entity16 have fallen behind in the @entity221 this season , they have come back to win only three times , a damning statistic given this team ’s erstwhile reputation for recovery			2
an early goal would give @entity22 something to cling to as well			0
@entity4 may have sounded confident about his future yesterday but if performances do n’t change soon then something else will			0
@entity16 ’s supporters will not stay classy forever			2
they may have more power than they think .			0
