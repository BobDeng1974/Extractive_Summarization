' if you want the job done , get an expert ' she is determined to lose her virginity and says of her mission : ' if you want the job done , get an expert			2
' @entity35 's chief creative officer , @entity67 , said of the documentary : ' it 's heart - warming			1
i 've never seen anything like it			0
' they talk in detail about what it 's like to have never had any sexual contact with anybody			0
' thanks to @entity17 , a real - life story about the late polio sufferer @entity82 and his sex surrogate , ms @entity12 , several other real - life ' sex surrogates ' have opened up about their controversial profession			1
shy virgin : paying $ 300 for a two - hour session , @entity9 engages in multiple sex acts with mrs @entity12 , before he has intercourse for the first time after a fortnight of her radical sex therapy sex therapy : the documentary , set to air on @entity10 's @entity35 on thursday , also follows 29 - year - old virgin @entity50 as she works with her sexual ' surrogate ' , @entity58 , 55 @entity98 , the founder of a private clinic close to @entity102 's @entity101 , is a sex therapist who provides treatment for psychosexual problems			1
her female staff of ' surrogate partners ' give clients , mostly 40 - something virgins , one - on - one coaching in ' caressing techniques , kissing , feeling relaxed with another person in the nude and , inevitably , the sex act itself , ' according to the @entity36			1
the film 40 - year - old @entity118 may have been a successful comedy of errors , however for these professionals , it is no laughing matter with overwhelming embarrassment and shyness crippling their self - esteem			1
ms @entity127 , who has a @entity128 from the @entity129 , explained : ' the focus is not sex , but familiarity and intimacy			1
we provide an environment , not for sexual pleasure , but for sexual learning			0
' people tend to be ill - informed about what a surrogate partner does			0
they think of it pejoratively , the same as a sex worker , but it ’s not , ' she added			1
' just as you have legitimate massage therapists and people who run massage parlors , there is a huge difference between them			0
' ms @entity127 charges clients between $ 3,000 and $ 5,000 for an average course of 12 to 15 sessions , some with herself , and some with the surrogate			1
today there are 30 sex surrogates registered in the @entity11 under the @entity158			1
surrogates must complete a two - week training program with the society to become registered , and they mus also work for a licensed sex therapist			1
not everyone is convinced of the practice 's legality , or ethics , however			0
@entity168 surrogates : since the release of @entity17 , real - life ' surrogates ' have opened up about their profession one - on - one coaching : sex surrogates help with caressing techniques , kissing , feeling relaxed with another person while naked with sex itself @entity179 , a defense attorney at the @entity102 law firm @entity180 and @entity181 , believes a sex surrogate is much the same as professional prostitution			1
he said : ' it does n’t matter if the client is disabled , it does n’t matter if he is suffering from some kind of emotional distress - that just makes it kind of sad			0
they have agreed to pay money for a sexual experience , and everyone understands that ’s the transaction			0
in my view , that ’s prostitution			0
' however ms @entity127 , who founded the @entity199 22 years ago , and is not a member of the @entity158 , insists it is purely a public service			0
ms @entity127 ’s staff have ' college degrees ' and are ' professionally trained clinicians ' who report to her after each session , with take place in the center 's offices , she says			0
based on a true story : the sessions , about late polio sufferer @entity213 and his sex surrogate , @entity12 , aims to shed light on the profession ' you would typically need a partner to resolve most sexual problems and for single men that is obviously an issue			1
most of the men who come to my center are sexually inexperienced , so the surrogate program allows them to progress with their treatment			0
' she continued : ' people have this perception of a sex surrogate as : " oh wow , i am going to have a sexual teacher and we ’re going to have hot sex ! " but it ’s not that way at all			1
' the sessions with the surrogate evolve gradually			2
it ’s a very gradual , sensual process of getting used to holding hands , caressing and kissing			0
[ the clients ] could come into treatment for several visits before they even take their clothes off			0
' mrs @entity12 agreed , saying : ' i look at our work like this : if you go to a prostitute , it ’s like going to a restaurant			1
you read the menu , you choose what you want , they prepare , they hope that you love it , and hopefully you want to come back			0
' with a surrogate , it ’s like going to cooking school			0
you get the ingredients , you learn to make a meal together - and then the point is to go out into the world and share that and not come back			0
' ms @entity127 ’s ' surrogate partners ' are required to be tested for @entity266 at least once every two months , as are the clients			0
@entity268 , one of the center 's surrogates whose background is in sexual psychology and social work , said : ' i usually begin sessions by working on eye contact and the way they hold their bodies			2
' we use massage and touch therapy , so the client can learn to be in the moment , be comfortable with their bodies and become aware of the sensations			2
' we take a mind - and - body approach and slowly remove anxiety out of the equation			0
' she would not comment on whether she had penetrative sex with her clients , however			2
