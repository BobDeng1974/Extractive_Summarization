@entity0 : @entity2 's @entity1 with @entity3 as his first black companion , @entity4 through all his incarnations , @entity1 has fought selflessly to ensure the survival of all manner of life forms across the @entity9			1
but now an international group of academics has branded the heroic @entity12 ‘ thunderingly racist ’			1
the doctor ’s new foes claim that his dismissive attitude towards black companions , his contempt for ‘ primitive ’ people , and even his passion for cricket are all proof of a reactionary ‘ whiteness ’ pervading his adventures			1
their concerns are published in a new book , @entity26 , which says the @entity28 programme is based in attitudes ‘ that continue to subjugate people of colour ’			1
but fans dismiss such criticisms as ‘ groundless ’ and ‘ ridiculous ’			1
one of the more bizarre theories is offered by @entity35 , an @entity36 professor , who argues that @entity39 ’s cricket - loving incarnation of the character in the @entity41 was thinly disguised nostalgia for the @entity43			1
he wrote : ‘ [ @entity44 ] portrayed the amateur @entity46 cricketer of the late 19th century when the game was characterised by both racial and class distinctions			1
‘ @entity50 also had a role in maintaining the status of @entity43 imperialism through the exercise of soft power as it was successfully inculcated by the colonial elites			0
@entity39 ’s cricketing doctor once again saw the @entity28 using who to promote a racial and class nostalgia that had already outlived its validity			1
’ several of the 23 contributors to the book lament the failure to cast a black or @entity66 actor as the doctor			1
and in earlier series , white actors were cast as other ethnicities			0
singled out for criticism is a 1977 storyline , @entity73 , set in @entity75 times and featuring the white actor @entity76 as a @entity78 villain			0
nostalgia for empire : @entity39 's cricket - loving @entity12 takes on the @entity81 there is also an attack on the ‘ second - class ’ treatment of black characters such as @entity4 in more recent episodes			1
a feminist contributor with the pen name @entity90 , says the doctor ’s relationship with @entity4 , who was played by @entity3 , is proof of the ‘ white perspective ’ of the series			2
she singles out a 2007 episode set in @entity98 when @entity4 voices her fears that she might be sold into slavery , only to be told by @entity2 ’s doctor that she should ‘ walk about like you own the place			0
it works for me ’			2
@entity90 wonders why the doctor will depose tyrannical alien regimes but will not challenge human slavery			0
and she claims the exchange ‘ betrays the ignorance of writers about historical racial violence and contemporary white privilege ’			1
there is further criticism of the introduction and @entity115 as a character last year , which was condemned as ‘ comic - book ’ and ‘ slapstick ’ , and did nothing to increase understanding of the @entity121			2
the doctor also dismisses as primitive any civilisation that does n’t share his belief in scientific progress – which the academic critics say is a very ‘ @entity128 ’ attitude			1
in the show ’s very first story , @entity130 ’s doctor compares the disbelief of his new companions when they first enter the @entity135 with the @entity136 ‘ whose savage mind disbelieved steam trains ’			2
and the introduction of the ‘ savage ’ – and scantily - clad – companion @entity142 in the 1970s is offered as further proof of the @entity12 ’s inherent racism since she was treated as being ‘ more primitive than us ’			1
runaway success : the latest @entity1 @entity147 , with sidekick @entity148 @entity150 academic @entity149 , who compiled the anthology , concluded : ‘ the biggest elephant in the room is the problem privately nursed by many fans of loving a tv show when it is thunderingly racist			0
’ but fans dismissed her criticisms			2
@entity159 , editor of @entity160 , said the show ‘ embraced rather than divided ’			2
he added : ‘ i think the suggestion the show is racist is ridiculous			0
doctor treated @entity4 no differently from the way he treated any other character			0
’ and the @entity28 said : ‘ @entity1 has a strong track record of diverse casting among both regular and guest cast			0
@entity3 became the first black companion and @entity171 starred in a major role for five years [ @entity173 ]			0
‘ reflecting the diversity of the @entity175 is a duty of the @entity28 , and casting on @entity1 is colour - blind			0
it is always about the best actors for the roles			0
’ @entity1 and raceedited by @entity149 , is published by @entity181 and is priced at £ 19.95			0
