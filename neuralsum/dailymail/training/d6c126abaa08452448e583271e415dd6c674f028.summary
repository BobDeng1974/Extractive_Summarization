by @entity0 published : 10:53 est , 9 july 2013 updated : 16:30 est , 9 july 2013 two food - loving students have come up with an ingenious way to tempt unadventurous peers into the kitchen with the creation of a naked cookbook			2
@entity7 and @entity8 decided to bare all in a brave bid to coax their fellow students away from the bar			1
the two , who are both 21 and childhood friends from @entity15 , came up with the quirky concept after realising traditional cookbooks were gathering dust in university accommodation across the country			2
budding chefs : @entity7 is a @entity22 student at the @entity23 and @entity8 is midway through a four - year course studying @entity25 and @entity26 at the @entity27 naked chefs : @entity7 ( @entity29 ) and @entity8 ( r ) decided to bare all for a naked cookbook in a brave bid to coax their fellow students away from the bar and to cook more the book , which also features a number of the girls ' student friends in the altogether , includes everything from nude skiers at the top of @entity41 , a giant peak in @entity43 , to stripped - down sportsmen pumping iron in a gym in @entity47 , all spicing up the pages of the cookbook , which otherwise offers fairly bog - standard recipes like bean casserole and @entity53			1
the girls , whose book has already stirred a lot of interest amongst fellow students , admitted it was not hard finding willing volunteers for their project			2
@entity7 said : ' everyone asks if it was tough to find students who were willing to strip , but that was the easy part - it was getting them to put their clothes back on that was the hard part			1
' we were at a party where we realised we had all been given a cookbook by our parents when we went away to university but out of 30 of us only two had even opened them			0
' it 's amazing how clueless students are when it comes to cooking - i had one friend who even asked me how to peel a carrot once			2
nice view : the book , which hopes to tempt lazy learners into cookery , includes everything from nude skiers at the top of @entity88 , a giant peak in @entity43 , to stripped - down sportsmen pumping iron in a gym in @entity47 ' @entity8 and i had picked up some kitchen skills during a summer catering job so that night we decided to come up with a way of making cooking fun and making a cookbook that appealed to students			1
' we thought we ’d try and emphasise the social aspect of cooking and bring back dinner parties as students love to watch @entity102			0
' hopefully the pictures are eye - catching enough to make sure the book is n’t just used as a coffee coaster for three years			1
' it ’s a cookbook put together by students , for students , so it ’s completely idiot proof			0
' both girls admit to having no previous experience in publishing before releasing the @entity114 this month			0
@entity7 is a @entity22 student at the @entity23 and @entity8 is midway through a four - year course studying @entity25 and @entity26 at the @entity27			1
@entity8 added : ' it ’s been a steep learning curve			1
fun way to learn : alongside the quirky pictures are simple recipes for student staples including spaghetti bolognese , curry , toad in the hole and even a step - by - step guide on how to boil an egg ' we ’ve had to learn to balance degree work and finishing the cookbook which has definitely been tough - especially during our exams			2
' we had a lot of late nights and a lot of help from friends and family but it ’s been fun throughout			0

@entity7 added : ' both our universities were very supportive and all our friends got involved			1
' one photoshoot involved the rugby team with cakes tactically placed to cover their modesty			0
' afterwards the whole team went outside and played a game of naked rugby out on the field despite it being a freezing day in february			0
' we had 60 of our friends strip off during a crazy two weeks of photoshoots - it was the most surreal fortnight of my life but the end result was definitely worth it			0
' the girls are donating £ 1 from every book sold to homeless charity crisis in recognition of the work they do in university cities across the country			1
so far 1,000 copies of the book have been printed for sale thanks to an entrepreneurial scholarship grant but the girls hope to soon attract a big name publisher so their cookbook can hit book shops @entity179			1
willing candidates : the girls , whose book has already stirred a lot of interest amongst fellow students , admitted it was not hard finding willing volunteers for their project			0
