a young father has hit the jackpot after digging up two giant gold nuggets worth nearly $ 200,000			1
the natural pieces of treasure were discovered on a private property in @entity6 , near @entity7 , north of @entity8 and have a combined weight of nearly 140 ounces			1
@entity10 , vice president of the @entity11 , said he had met the lucky prospector , who wished to remain anonymous for security reasons , and not surprisingly was ' overjoyed '			1
he makes a living from this stuff , so a find like that is very exciting , ' mr @entity10 said			1
‘ he did n't want to be named until he had sold them off			0
he ’s fairly young and it ’s obviously a fair bit of money we ’re talking about			2
‘ it was very unusual			2
most of the finds are smaller than a fingernail , so this one is pretty special			0
' mr @entity10 added that gold mining was more of a hobby for most people			1
‘ most of us do n’t do this for the money			0
@entity45 detecting is very expensive , ' he said			0
' the detector alone is about $ 7000			2
i suppose it ’s like fishing , in that it ’s usually cheaper to go and buy your fish than the costs of catching the fish			0
we mostly do this for the experience , so a find like that is the bonus of a lifetime			0
' selling the gold can also be difficult because a licence is needed to sell to overseas buyers			0
‘ i believe he has sold one of the nuggets and is preparing to sell the other			0
to sell gold overseas you need to get a licence which is very difficult to obtain , so it can take a while to sell them within @entity74 , as there are more affluent people overseas , ‘ mr @entity10 said			1
