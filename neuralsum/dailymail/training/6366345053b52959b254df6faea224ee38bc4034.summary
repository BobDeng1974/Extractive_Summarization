@entity0 will return - and this time it 's to be in a plot which his creator @entity3 dreamed up almost 60 years ago			1
the world 's most famous spy will feature in a new novel by @entity7 , in which he infiltrates the glamorous world of 1950s motorsport to foil an attack on a grand prix race			1
originally titled murder on wheels , the story was created by @entity3 before his death in 1964 for a 007 tv series which was never made			1
the plot was never used unlike most of the ideas for the series , assembled in the late 1950s , murder on wheels was never turned into a short story by @entity3 and did not become part of the blockbuster film series			1
it has now been handed to the best - selling novelist and screenwriter @entity7 , who said : ' how could i possibly refuse ? '			0
the book features original characters such as @entity39 and @entity40 , has the working title @entity42 and is due for release in september next year			1
mr @entity7 - who recently wrote a new adventure for @entity45 - said : ' it 's no secret that @entity3 's extraordinary character has had a profound influence on my life			2
' so when the estate approached me to write a new @entity0 novel , how could i possibly refuse ? big shoes to fill : @entity3 ( left ) created the idea in the 1950s and it will be written by @entity7 ( right ) ' it 's a huge challenge - more difficult even than @entity45 in some ways - but having original , unpublished material by @entity3 has been an inspiration			1
this is a book i had to write			0
' the prolific author 's screenwriting credits include @entity62 and @entity63 , and his @entity65 series about a teenage spy has sold more than 19 million books			0
he follows in the footsteps of authors including @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 who have written new @entity0 books since @entity3 's death			2
mr @entity71 's book , @entity76 , was published last year and featured @entity0 embroiled in a civil war in 1969 @entity78			2
the @entity0 books inspired one of the most successful film franchises in @entity24 history , beginning with dr no in 1962 , and have sold more than 100 million copies			0
kept under wraps : most of @entity3 's ideas were turned into books or films , but a few are kept by his estate yet a small number of plots created for 007 by @entity3 have still not been used , and they are kept tightly under wraps by his family			0
his great - niece @entity96 said : ' there are a few plot outlines which he never used and which , till now , have never been published , or aired			0
' given that @entity7 is as brilliant a screenwriter as he is a novelist , we thought it would be exciting to see what he would do with one of them			0

it featured in his work for *proposed* @entity0 tv series that was never made
