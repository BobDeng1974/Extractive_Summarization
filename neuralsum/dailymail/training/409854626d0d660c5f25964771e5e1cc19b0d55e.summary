the @entity1 solider who used his helmet camera filmed a shocking firefight with the @entity4 has finally been revealed - and he says he never meant for the footage to go public			1
private first class @entity6 , 37 , says he can no longer watch the video , which has been viewed on @entity8 23million times , because it is too painful to watch			1
it also got him in trouble with his commanders , who called the dramatic cries for help after he was wounded served as a propaganda victory for the @entity4 in @entity16			2
he is currently recovering from injuries at @entity21 , @entity22 courage under fire : the soldier 's helmet cam is running as he and his unit come under heavy fire in @entity16 too close for comfort : dust kicked up by a bullet can be seen on the video , right near the soldier 's feet as he descends the mountain @entity35 spoke to the @entity36 for the first time since the video went public in september and became an international sensation			1
the three and a half minute video captures @entity35 ' peril as gunshots can be seen and heard all around him			2
he fires several shots as he descends a mountain in an effort to draw fire away from his comrades			1
as he makes his way down , bullets can be seen ricocheting by his feet - some coming dangerously close as he scrambles behind a rock for safety			2
but as he crouches , the soldier drops his gun as a ricochet strikes his hand			1
' i 'm hit ! ' the soldier can be heard yelling repeatedly			1
' help me ! ' taking cover : the soldier can be seen trying to duck behind a rock as shots ring out close to him his cries are not answered as shots continue to be heard			1
in an interview with the @entity36 , @entity35 admitted that drawing himself into the open might not have been the smartest move			2
' it was n’t the most tactically brilliant thing to do , ' he said			2
eventually , even though he was struck by shrapnel four times , he was able to climb back to the cover of a nearby armored vehicle			1
@entity35 said he never intended to publish the video for millions to see - he was online hoping to archive in a private @entity8 account			2
when he set the video to upload , the video hosting service estimated it would take one hour to process the raw footage and put it online			0
so he left for five hours			0
in deep : as he screamed for help , shots continued to be fired in the direction of the injured soldier when he returned , he had a message from @entity8 user @entity83 waiting for him			1
the user , who has a channel that specializes in raw footage of combat , asked @entity35 if he could use the video			0
two days later , after the clip been seen by hundreds of thousands of people around the world and been broadcast on @entity93 and the other major networks , his sergeant called him and demanded the video be taken down			0
military brass feared the the video - with @entity35 ' cries for help - could be used as propaganda by the @entity4			0
he contacted @entity83 and asked him to remove the video			0
the user never got back to him			0
the @entity36 reports that a video like @entity35 ' and all the traffic and subscribers it drew - could be worth $ 150,000 in ad revenue sharing for @entity108 @entity35 said that he was part of a team on a reconnaissance and intelligence - gathering mission when they encountered the @entity4 fighters			0
he said : ‘ i got a hit a total of 4 times			1
my helmet cam died and i made it down the mountain on my own			0
i was also hit in the side of my helmet and my eye pro was shot off of my face			1
' desperate : at one point in the video , his gun was knocked out of his hands by the force of one of the shots down , but not out : the soldier survived the assault after he said he was shot four times , but was not seriously injured ' the rest of the squad was pinned down by machine gun fire			1
i did n't start the video until a few minutes into the firefight for obvious reasons			0
' i came out into the open to draw fire so my squad could get to safety			1
' he said that one of the shots ' struck the tube by my hand of the 203 grenade launcher which knocked it out of my hands			0
' ' when i picked the rifle back up it was still functional but the grenade launcher tube had a nice sized 7.62 cal bullet hole in it and was rendered useless			0
' the video was uploaded by @entity8 user @entity83 , which promises even more never - before - seen footage from the front lines of @entity16			0
this footage is part of an ongoing project documenting of the war in @entity16 .			0
