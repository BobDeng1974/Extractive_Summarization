@entity0 ’s will be treated or even prevented by replacing faulty genes , an expert in the disease has predicted			1
men and women could be given a nasal spray packed with healthy versions of the defective genes that cause the illness			1
professor @entity10 , of @entity11 , said the entire population could eventually be screened in middle - age to identify those at most risk of the memory - robbing disease			1
they could then be given cutting - edge gene therapy and other treatments to stop the disease ever developing			1
@entity22 : men and women could be given a nasal spray packed with healthy versions of the defective genes that cause @entity0 's @entity0 ’s and other forms of dementia affect more than 800,000 @entity27 , with the number expected to double in a generation as the population ages			1
existing drugs delay the progress of @entity0 ’s , but their failure to tackle the underlying cause in the brain means that the effect quickly wears off and the disease soon takes its devastating course			2
the professor , who was given a @entity40 in the queen ’s birthday honours last year for her work on @entity0 , made the prediction after jointly leading the biggest - ever study into the genetics of the disease			1
the landmark study , involving more than 180 researchers from 15 countries , pinpointed 11 genes that raise the risk of @entity0 ’s			1
the size of the collaboration allowed them to identify more genes in less than three years than have been found in the past two decades			0
by taking the total to 21 , it also more than doubles the number of known @entity0 ’s genes , the journal @entity56 reports			1
@entity0 ’s charities said the ‘ exciting ’ discovery of genes linked with the disease ‘ opens up new avenues to explore in the search for treatments for the condition ’			2
screening : professor @entity10 says the entire population could eventually be screened in middle - age to identify those at most risk of the disease the new genes were found by comparing the dna of more than 25,000 people suffering from @entity0 ’s with that of 48,000 people without the disease			1
professor @entity10 , who is chief scientific adviser to the @entity80 in addition to being a working researcher , said : ‘ what surprised us most about the findings was the very strong pattern that showed several genes implicating the body ’s immune system in causing dementia			2
‘ each individual gene will carry a relatively low risk but when you put all the information together , they are telling us an interesting and novel story and that takes us in a new direction			0
’ she added that the find needs to be followed up with ‘ great urgency ’ to determine just how the genes cause dementia			2
knowing this will speed the search for new drug treatments			0
medicine : existing drugs delay the progress of @entity0 's , but fail to tackle the underlying cause in the brain but another possibility is correcting the flawed dna , or the genetic variations that cause @entity0 ’s , by giving people a nasal spray packed with healthy genes			1
professor @entity10 said : ‘ i do think that in ten years ’ time we might be looking at a genetic therapy			0
that might be feasible but not quite yet			0
‘ if you have variation that you know is contributing to a disease , the most effective way of reducing the risk is to change the variation in a very precise way			0
genetic therapies will allow you to just change the elements that are contributing to the disease			0
‘ drugs may not be precise and can cause side - effects			0
’ she added that ‘ in the distant future ’ everyone in their 40s or 50s could be screened for dementia genes and given genetic therapy and other treatments in a bid to stop the disease ever developing			2
the study also suggested links between @entity0 ’s and multiple sclerosis and parkinson ’s disease			0
professor @entity148 of the @entity149 , which part - funded the study , as did @entity151 , said : ‘ understanding how our genetic code contributes to alzheimer ’s disease , other dementias and neurodegenerative diseases is a crucial part of the puzzle in learning how we can prevent their devastating effects			0
