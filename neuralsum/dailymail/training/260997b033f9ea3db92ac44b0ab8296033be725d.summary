by @entity0 published : 06:17 est , 22 february 2013 updated : 18:22 est , 22 february 2013 @entity1 bled to death after a routine back operation she may not actually have needed a fit and healthy woman bled to death after having routine surgery for a back pain			1
@entity1 , 42 , died just 14 hours after the operation at @entity9			1
her death came after staff in the hospital 's orthopaedic department warned managers about grave risks to patients ' extreme pressure and stress ' in the department			1
an inquest was halted and @entity22 coroner @entity21 asked police to investigate following the emergence of the letter outlining staff concerns			2
ms @entity1 had started suffering from back pain in august 2009			2
the pain was so bad that she was bedridden for two weeks despite being prescribed with painkillers by her gp on numerous occasions			0
she was referred to the orthopaedic clinic at @entity33 but by the time her appointment came round , her pain had subsided			0
the clinic diagnosed her as suffering from a prolapsed ( herniated ) disc			0
unbeknown to ms @entity1 , this condition quite often resolves itself over time without the need for further treatment			2
despite this , the hospital listed her for surgery and she was advised that the pain could return if the operation was not carried out			1
because she did not want the pain to return , she agreed to the procedure , which took place in march 2010			0
when her sister @entity48 visited her in hospital later that evening , she found her very pale and complaining of stomach pain			0
nurses discovered she had very low blood pressure and because she was in pain , administered medication to relieve it			2
at 2am the following morning , ms @entity1 's father received a telephone call from the hospital informing them that she was seriously ill. to their horror , by the time her family arrived at the hospital , she had died			1
mrs @entity48 , 56 , said : ' i just remember being in total and absolute shock			0
i never expected anything like this to happen			0
we have so many questions about what happened to @entity1 and believe if it was nâ€™t for the surgery , she would still be here today			1
' a report from the post mortem examination listed the cause of death as retroperitoneal haemorrhage ( internal bleeding )			1
staff at @entity9 had warned managers about grave risks to patients due to ' extreme pressure and stress ' in the orthopaedic department the report suggests that the wrong disc was operated on and that the internal bleed was created during the operation			1
her family later lodged a claim for medical negligence which has now been settled out of court for a six - figure sum			0
@entity94 , head of medical negligence at @entity97 's solicitors , which represented the family , said serious internal bleeding after the operation should have been spotted and treated by doctors			1
he said : ' they could have saved her for up to 30 minutes before she died			2
they had got all the information if someone cared to look			0
' the hospital was warned of ' extreme pressure and stress ' in the orthopaedic department a letter just weeks before @entity1 died in march , 2010			1
a letter was sent to former chief executive @entity113 and referred to a meeting between her and medical director dr @entity115 in which the orthopaedic team warned of danger to patients			2
the letter stated ' it was only a matter of time before the situation led to significant patient morbidity and mortality '			0
the doctor who performed the operation on @entity1 is still working at the hospital under supervision			1
a spokesman for @entity9 said : ' we are extremely sorry for the loss suffered by @entity1 's family			2
we treat the safety of our patients as an utmost priority			0
' after @entity1 's death we began a full internal investigation and also sought the views of external experts			1
' we have fully implemented all of the changes recommended by those investigations			0
' the letter and its contents are a matter for consideration at the inquest and it would therefore be inappropriate for us to comment further			0

@entity1 died hours after the operation at @entity148

it later emerged she may not have needed the surgery after all
