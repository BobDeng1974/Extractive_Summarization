@entity0 continued their perfect start to the season in @entity3 with a comprehensive win over bottom side @entity5			1
after being held out for 34 minutes the visitors finally got themselves ahead through @entity8 , who rounded the keeper and slotted home with ease , following a sumptuous ball over the top from @entity14 - his five assist of the season already			1
five minutes later @entity0 had the opportunity to extend their lead with that man @entity14 again the architect , closing in on goal before being hacked down by both @entity20 and @entity21 - however bizarrely only the former got the red card despite both of them involved in the altercation			1
to cap a remarkable few minutes @entity14 then smashed the penalty over the bar as the score remained 1 - 0 to the visitors			2
the floodgates opened after that though with goals from @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity14 completed the rout and kept the @entity39 giants top of @entity3			1
see how the action panned out below host commentator perhaps it was a harsh sending off , but @entity0 have torn @entity5 apart here			1
five different scorers and a continuation of their 100 per cent start to the season			2
@entity46 away next up for @entity48 's men on wednesday night			0
having been anonymous for 30 minutes , @entity14 has been superb since and deserved his sublime goal			1
he has harried every @entity5 man on the ball and not wasted a single pass			0
@entity54 is found at the far post by @entity56 , but his cut back goes just wide as @entity36 attempts to get there before the post			1
perhaps he could have scored there ... @entity0 just knocking the ball about now like it 's an exhibition game			2
real hit @entity63 for eight yesterday , and this has n't been a weekend to claim @entity3 is competitive			0
what a goal by @entity14 , who chips the goalkeeper and defender with his right foot			2
357 goals for @entity0 and this one looks like the other 356 others			0
@entity72 comes too far out of his area and made up the little man 's mind for him , but it 's still a great finish			2
a clean sheet is all @entity48 will want now to keep up their 100 per cent record this season for the team of @entity82 ... @entity83 , quietely effective tonight , comes off for @entity84 @entity54 , who in truth has been dodgy today , slices a clearance as the ball falls to @entity88			1
but the @entity5 man 's weak shot trickles wide			2
it 's quiet inside the ground as @entity14 piles into the area			2
he is brought down by @entity94 , but it was more of a shoulder barge as @entity98 waves play on			2
the floodgates are well and truly open , as predicted			0
great football on the left as @entity35 flicks the ball to @entity103			2
the left - back 's pace takes him away from the @entity5 defence and the cut back to @entity36 , who slots home from eight yards			1
and it will probably be more			0
two in two for young @entity112 @entity111 @entity14 gets through two on one with @entity35 to his left ... he slides the ball through to the youngster and he slides the ball past @entity72			1
very much like @entity118 's finish against @entity119 yesterday			0
@entity35 hit the winner against @entity121 in midweek having come on as a sub , too			0
@entity5 have had a bit of the ball since @entity8 went off , and they have a free - kick on the edge of the area			1
the referee does have spray on him this time ! but @entity132 's free - kick hits the wall			2
the ball goes out of play after @entity136 is hit by @entity94 's flailing arm			1
uh oh , the @entity138 is on a heap off the pitch but @entity0 have played on			0
when the ball eventually goes out of play , we see how @entity8 stretched to keep the ball in play and landed on his backside			2
it may be that back injury ... but the medical staff wo n't let him back on despite him being back on his feet			0
@entity35 comes on to replace him			0
neat footwork in the area from @entity103 and @entity14 ends with @entity83 , who curls over from the corner of the box			1
oh , and it 's pouring down in @entity157			0
@entity5 , their centre - back @entity20 sent off , have no defenders on the bench			0
it 's going to be a long 45 minutes			0
here 's the moment @entity14 was brought down in the area by both @entity164 and @entity21			1
and the floodgates have opened			0
what a goal from @entity34			0
his first for the club as the ball falls to him 25 yards out			0
he thumps it into the corner past @entity72 , who has absolutely no chance			0
the replay shows it may have slightly touched the defender , but nonetheless , that is a hit			0
in an attempt to clear things up ... here we go			0
both @entity164 and @entity21 tackled @entity14 in the area , but only one was given the red card			1
a mad decision but @entity183 has had a crazy evening already			0
with 10 men , surely @entity0 will open the floodgates will open			0
@entity14 misses the penalty ... he 's hit it high and wide ! unbelievable few minutes			1
@entity188 in @entity157 ... @entity20 is sent off despite it looking like @entity21 who pulled him down ! @entity83 finds @entity14 in the area , the @entity192 controls it , gets in between two defenders and is fouled			1
@entity14 's fifth assist of the season			1
he really is becoming the new king of the perfectly weighted through ball in @entity56 's absence			0
every goal @entity0 have scored this season has been made or scored by @entity14			1
@entity14 , who i was just about to say had done nothing in the game , plays a wonderful ball over the top for @entity8 , who gets in just before the keeper , rounds him and slots home			2
goalkeeper @entity72 did get a touch to @entity8 's initial touch around him , but could n't deflect the ball clear , and @entity0 finally have their opener			1
the @entity138 's third goal of the season			0
@entity83 rather disappointingly produces a ' hit and hope ' effort looking for a deflection , and the game has settled as @entity220 look to keep the ball			0
@entity0 will want a goal before half - time to hurt @entity5			1
you get the feeling one would open the floodgates ... last year 's top scorer for @entity5 , @entity228 , heads just wide after a fine cross into the area			1
@entity231 was rooted to the spot and the hosts could easily be 2 - 0 up			0
saying that , a very open game at both ends so far			0
at the other end , @entity236 floats a long ball over the defence and @entity8 bravely gets up ahead of the goalkeeper but heads wide			1
@entity8 gets charged in the back by @entity242 with the ball miles away , just like his injury at the @entity245			2
he 's down for 30 seconds but gets back up , and then with his next touch flicks the ball over a @entity5 defender 's head			2
back to the football ... the ball falls to @entity8 in the area at a slight angle and with not much space			2
the @entity138 tries to spash the ball past @entity72 , but the keeper saves well			0
a dink over the onrushing @entity72 would have done nicely there ... match official @entity183 has dropped his cannister of vanishing spray twice , and then , unbelievably , he throws it onto the sideline			0
he 's done with it			0
no more fun in the defensive wall			0
so good they named him twice			0
@entity136 is in acres of space inside the area on the left , and his cross-cum - shot evades @entity36 and goes out for a throw in			1
too powerful and erratic from @entity103			0
he 'll be disappointed with that			0
@entity54 dives in on @entity273 but misses the ball , he did n't need to go to ground ! @entity88 skips past him and looks for the far post , but @entity34 does so well to clear the ball before a @entity5 man got on the end of it			1
poor from @entity54 , brilliant from @entity281			0
0 - 0 after 10 minutes			0
when current @entity5 coach @entity283 faced @entity0 last season his @entity282 lost 7 - 0 so , so far so good			1
@entity54 gets himself into trouble as @entity88 picks up a loose ball in the centre circle ... he paces forward but @entity103 comes back to clear for a corner to @entity5			1
the corner finds its way to @entity88 , whose volley goes a few yards wide			2
corner for @entity0 after @entity103 's centre is cleared			1
@entity36 's header is awful , and goes straight back to corner taker @entity34			1
the ball goes up the other end and @entity231 has to rush off his line in @entity298 fashion to clear out for a throw in			2
@entity132 has a go from 18 yards , but it 's weak and into the arms of @entity231			1
@entity103 puts a disappointing ball into the box from the left in space , cleared by @entity21 inside the area			1
the @entity112 then puts another poor ball into the box , but @entity0 have plenty of time on the ball			2
early corner for @entity0 finds its way to @entity314 , who pulls back for @entity54 , but his effort with the outside of the foot is deflected wide for another corner			1
perhaps @entity54 could have stroked that one , rather than attempt a clever effort			0
the resulting corner comes to nothing before @entity8 is thwarted on a forward run			0
and they 're off ! everyone tipping @entity0 at 2 - 11 , @entity5 are at 14 - 1			2
we 'll see how that turns out ... the form guide suggests @entity0 will win this easily , with @entity5 struggling so far this season and @entity0 turning on the style			1
the teams are just about to come out , with @entity83 leading @entity0 in their fluorescent kit , looking more like 11 @entity82 than a football team			1
@entity5 , of course , play in @entity0 's famous red and blue			1
here 's a sneak preview of the dressing room from @entity0 earlier ... and welcome to @entity338 's live coverage of @entity0 's trips to @entity5			1
here are your teams : @entity5 : @entity72 , @entity21 , @entity342 , @entity164 , @entity228 , @entity88 , @entity343 , @entity344 , @entity132 , @entity94 and @entity345 @entity0 : @entity231 , @entity34 , @entity346 , @entity36 , @entity83 , @entity14 , @entity8 , @entity236 , @entity136 , @entity314 , @entity54			1

@entity8 puts @entity0 ahead thanks to @entity14 's superb assist
@entity14 is then brought down in the area , with @entity164 sent off
the @entity192 sent his penalty wide , before @entity34 scored a *screamer*
@entity35 , brought on because of a @entity8 injury , scores the third
pedro scores fourth after sublime team play involving @entity103 and @entity35
@entity14 scores fifth with fine chip over goalkeeper @entity72
@entity14 and @entity8 start together for the first time this season
@entity5 : @entity72 , @entity21 , @entity342 , @entity164 , @entity228 , @entity88 , @entity343 , @entity344 , @entity132 , @entity94 and @entity345
@entity0 : @entity231 , @entity34 , @entity346 , @entity36 , @entity83 , @entity14 , @entity8 , @entity236 , @entity136 , @entity314 , @entity54
a win will take them four points clear of @entity368 in the table
