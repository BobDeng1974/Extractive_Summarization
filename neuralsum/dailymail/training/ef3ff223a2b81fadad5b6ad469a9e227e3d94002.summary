course : @entity1 has been accepted to study for a maths degree - despite not going to school she spends her spare time in a similar way to many other ten - year - old girls - playing with @entity8 dolls and making loom bands			1
but the key difference between @entity1 and other children her age is that she has been accepted to study for a university maths degree - despite not going to school			1
@entity1 , from @entity15 , @entity16 , has enrolled on an @entity18 course months after she passed her a-levels - and wants to study for a phd before running her own bank			1
the girl , who gained a c grade in her maths gcse aged six , has joined the course which started this month			2
her younger brother @entity25 is already studying for his a-levels - also aged six			1
the siblings are both home - schooled by their mother @entity29 , who has converted the living room of their semi-detached , three - bedroom house into a makeshift classroom			1
@entity34 mrs @entity1 , 37 , said : ‘ @entity1 is doing so well			2
she took a test recently and scored 100 per cent			2
applying to the university was an interesting process because of her age			0
‘ we even had to talk to the vice-chancellor			0
after they interviewed her they realised that this has been her idea from the beginning			0
from the age of seven @entity1 has wanted to go to university			2
happy : @entity1 ( left ) is pictured last year with her mother @entity29 ( right ) after passing her a-level in maths following in her footsteps : the schoolgirl ( left and right ) is pictured at home in @entity15 with her brother @entity53 ‘ but i was afraid it was too soon			1
she would say , “ mum , when am i starting ? ” , and go on and on and on			0
finally , after three years she told me , “ @entity57 , i think it is about time i started university now ”			0
’ mrs @entity1 added that @entity1 - who will study for her degree at home - was ‘ flying ’ and ‘ so happy ’ when she was accepted by the university , and wants to be a millionaire			1
she said : ‘ for now we want her to enjoy her childhood as well as her maths			0
by the time she was four i had taught her the alphabet , her numbers , and how to add , subtract , multiply and division			0
‘ i saw that she loved patterns so developed a way of using that to teach her new things			0
i thought i would try her with algebra , and she loved it more than anything			0
’ another bright spark : in 1981 @entity80 ( above ) from @entity81 became the youngest person to pass the exam for @entity84 , as a ten - year - old - and graduated aged 13 with a first - class degree in maths @entity1 stunned her parents last year when she achieved a b grade in her pure maths a-level			1
she applied to the @entity18 last august - and after a phone interview , an essay and an exam , she was told in december that she had been accepted onto the course			1
her father @entity94 , 42 , a managing director , added : ‘ i can not tell you how happy and proud i am as a father			0
the desire of every parent is to see their children exceed them , and take the family name to great heights , and my children have done just that			0
