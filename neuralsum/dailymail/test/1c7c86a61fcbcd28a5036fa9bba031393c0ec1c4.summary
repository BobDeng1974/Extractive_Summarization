the family of a heavily pregnant @entity2 's witness who died along with her baby after she refused a blood transfusion , have defended the woman who they said had put her baby 's life above her own			1
@entity10 , 28 , was diagnosed with leukaemia seven months into her pregnancy , and although doctors at @entity15 's @entity14 in @entity16 told her she could give birth via a caesarean section and undergo chemotherapy , she refused both options as they required her to receive a blood transfusion			1
however her mother @entity22 has told @entity23 that her daughter believed the cancer treatment would harm her unborn child , named @entity27			1
' she knew chemo would kill @entity27 — she put the baby first each and every time and no matter what happened , she wanted that baby alive , ' @entity22 said			2
a pregnant @entity35 woman and her baby have died after she refused a blood transfusion ' we were told she would have six weeks to live — she fought to have the baby			1
that 's the decision she made — she gave up her life			0
' instead she blamed local doctors for her daughter 's unnecessary death , claiming they should have tested her for the cancer sooner , but instead only attributed her symptoms to the flu and her pregnancy			0
the @entity15 mother 's baby died in utero three days after she was offered a caesarean			1
she had a stillbirth and died 13 days after her diagnosis by suffering a stroke and multi-organ failure			1
@entity10 's elder daughter @entity57 , who was only 10 when her mother died in august 2009 , also defended her mother			1
however the 28 - year - old 's brother @entity60 blamed the religion for how his sister died , calling her a ' fool '			1
' it was not my sister who was sad and selfish , it is this religion and any other teaching this sort of nonsense , ' he said			0
@entity10 , 28 , had pregnancy complications due to her leukaemia but rejected treatment on religious grounds her treating haematologist at the @entity14 in @entity16 , dr @entity77 , said the mother understood the risks of her refusal to accept blood			1
' her refusal to receive a blood transfusion meant that we were unable to perform a caesarean section and to deliver the foetus , ' dr @entity77 told @entity87			2
' obviously it 's a very big ethical issue			0
legally in @entity90 the mother has the right to make decisions on her behalf and her foetus 's behalf			0
' most mothers would make decisions in favour of the unborn baby and this was a decision that was not in favour of the unborn baby			2
' dr @entity77 added : ' if we were to give chemotherapy without blood transfusion support she surely would have died			1
' she was being treated at the @entity106 and the prince of @entity108 in @entity16 hospital staff were ' distressed ' over what were perceived to be two avoidable deaths , as 83 percent of pregnant leukaemia sufferers go into remission with treatment			1
dr @entity77 said it was a challenge to respect a patient who refuses life - saving treatment			2
i think that i did my best to help her			0
but ultimately i could n't change the course of events , ' she said			0
in a recent article published in the @entity126 about the 2009 case , dr @entity77 and her colleague dr @entity124 wrote : ' not administering blood products in this case undoubtedly contributed to the death of mother and foetus			0
' refusal of a lifesaving intervention by an informed patient is generally well respected , but the rights of a mother to refuse such interventions on behalf of her foetus is more controversial			0
' @entity141 , an expert in ethics and law at the @entity144 said the current law allows the mother to make decisions that would directly affect her unborn baby , the @entity140 reported			2
she said @entity150 are often condemned for their beliefs , especially in relation to their stance against blood transfusions			0
' this woman has a long - held commitment to the @entity35 faith and that 's how she chose to die , ' she told the @entity140			2
' when your foetus is in utero , it is inextricably tied to your life			0
' jehovah 's witnesses refuse blood transfusions because they believe the @entity166 commands them to abstain from ingesting blood and that avoiding blood pays respect to @entity170 as the giver of life			0
