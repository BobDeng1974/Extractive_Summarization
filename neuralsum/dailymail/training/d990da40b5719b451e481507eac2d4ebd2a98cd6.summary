by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity3 got the better of @entity4			1
first , he admitted that he had next to nothing to do with the signing of @entity7 , @entity8 ’s unlikely hero on the opening day of the season			1
‘ the deal was already on the table , ’ said @entity4 , although he clearly did not try to veto the £ 4million transfer from @entity12 set up by chairman @entity13 and technical director @entity14			1
so , how about the serendipity which saw @entity18 sent off in the first half and @entity7 moved from centre half to right back at @entity21 on saturday , enabling him to later burst forward and win the game in stoppage time ? @entity7 delight : a last gasp winner from @entity7 ensured @entity8 won their opening @entity27 match there was only one game in the top flight in 2013 - 14 to see both sides reduced to 10 men ( @entity34 v @entity33 in january )			1
‘ no , no , i was not surprised to see him score , ’ said @entity4 , with a shake of his head , before his face cracked into a grin and he indicated with a finger that his nose was growing like @entity41 ’s			2
with his improving @entity44 , and his gift for mime , perhaps we will begin to understand more of @entity4 ’s character this season			2
the @entity49 can laugh after a win , but he is driven			0
when @entity7 ghosted behind @entity21 ’s defence to collect a pass from @entity53 and slide the ball into the net , he pummelled the air with both fists			1
a winning start as @entity13 ’s ninth @entity8 manager ( or head coach , as they prefer ) and proof that he might be the one to inject steel into a club too often seen as lacking resolve			1
on this point , he was happy to take some credit			0
‘ the team showed we are ambitious and we believe every time that we can win , ’ said @entity4			1
‘ it is important to build this mentality and spirit			0
this will give us confidence and trust in our style and more belief			0
’ pointing the way : @entity8 manager @entity4 joked he was not surprised to see @entity7 find the net at @entity83 , his high - pressing tactics produced intense , attractive football , but also clean sheets			1
saints conceded just once in their first seven @entity27 games last season			0
spurs rode their luck at @entity91 , but keeper @entity92 was magnificent and the new boss was rewarded for bold strategic decisions : not to remove a striker when @entity18 was dismissed and to start with 20 - year - old @entity7 ahead of captain @entity96			1
‘ we made our decisions based on information from training and pre-season			0
it was a good decision from the manager , ’ said @entity4			2
the versatile @entity7 , eased from central defence to full back after @entity18 ’s red card , defended solidly and offered greater adventure once @entity21 ’s @entity108 was sent off and the teams were reduced to 10 a side for the last 27 minutes			1
what a start : @entity7 is the opening day hero as he celebrates with @entity112 ( left ) and @entity113 ( right ) an @entity114 under 21 international , @entity7 is the grandson of former @entity116 secretary @entity115			2
born in @entity117 , he was raised in @entity118 from the age of 10 , when his mother ’s job took the family overseas			0
while @entity4 was having problems controlling the length of his nose , @entity124 ’s woes were also growing			0
the heat is already on the @entity21 boss after losing a derby which might have turned out differently had @entity131 scored a first - half penalty			2
‘ the start is a trigger to the whole season , ’ said @entity124			0
‘ the perfect example is our first two seasons back in the @entity27			0
we took 14 points in the first eight games in the first , and only eight in the first eight last season — which was a struggle			0

@entity4 got @entity8 reign off to winning start
new boy @entity7 scored winning goal to hand @entity8 win over @entity21
defender moved to @entity152 from @entity12 in £ 4m deal
