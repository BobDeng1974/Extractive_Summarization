it 's the snack that came back to bite one party leader – but @entity2 fearlessly tucked into a bacon buttie yesterday in front of photographers			0
the @entity7 chief was canvassing ahead of next week ’s by - election in @entity9 and @entity10 in @entity11 , when his deputy leader @entity12 ordered the @entity13 a bacon sandwich from a takeaway van			1
unlike @entity16 – who was subjected to widespread mockery – mr @entity2 passed the test , taking sizeable mouthfuls throughout			1
although the ladies said they ' did n’t really know ' if they would vote next week , they joyously gave the @entity7 leader a ' bacon buttie ' to gorge on			2
he seemed to enjoy the sandwich , laughing with the journalists and taking good - sized mouthfuls each time , though at times he was not able to make eating the sandwich look as sophisticated as he may have hoped			2
the verdict was that he did much better than @entity16			0
@entity16 , who was subjected to widespread mockery earlier this year when he ate a bacon sandwich but when asked whether @entity41 bacon would be an issue , mr @entity2 replies he would be “ very worried ”			1
it came as a @entity45 poll for @entity46 last night showed that @entity47 ( on 50 per cent support ) is expected to win the by - election comfortably			0
@entity7 is lying second with 31 per cent .			0

@entity7 leader was *campaigning* in @entity11 ahead of a by - election next week

passed the sandwich eating test by taking sizeable mouthfuls throughout
comes after @entity16 was subject to widespread mockery when he ate a bacon sandwich
