by @entity0 with their necks encircled with beads , their chins painted red with ochre and massed bracelets jangling on their wrists , the women of @entity5 's @entity3 and @entity4 tribes are a colourful sight			1
but while the beads might look pretty , as photographer @entity15 explains , the elaborate jewellery is more than mere decoration			2
for not only does it denote wealth , it also reveals subtle clues about status as well			2
' beads are worn mainly for their beauty , but they also tell you about relationships and special events , ' explains @entity15			2
' @entity28 bracelets are worn by everybody and are made of beads and bits of old tyres			2
most wear brass anklets too			0
' spectacular : both @entity3 and @entity4 women wear elaborate beaded collars , decorative headdresses and , once married , heavy brass earrings beginning : girls get their first necklaces from their father - crimson strings of beads that indicate the girl in question has had a husband chosen for her engaged : this girl 's crimson collar tells onlookers that a husband has been chosen for her but that she is yet to find a boyfriend			1
when she does , the collar will come off although separate tribes , the @entity3 and @entity4 are related and share several similarities , among them a passion for beads			1
both are semi-nomadic pastoralists living in northern @entity5 's @entity58 and both make their living from cows			1
rather gruesomely , their staple food is cow 's blood , drawn using a special arrow that pierces the vein without killing the animal , mixed with milk - a protein - heavy diet that helps them survive in one of the harshest environments on the planet			1
but a penchant for blood shakes and cattle herding notwithstanding , both @entity3 and @entity4 are famous for their bright beads with women in particular wearing them every day			1
' @entity3 girls are given strings of beads by their fathers from a very young age , ' explains @entity15			1
' the first layers of necklaces are usually red , as it means the girl is engaged which takes place at a very young age			0
striking : the biggest collars are worn by teenage girls , who are given them by their boyfriends			1
when they marry , they have to return the elaborate necklaces status symbol : collars are not merely decorative : they also reveal much about a woman 's status and whether she is married or not new addition : thanks to the cheap @entity108 goods that have flooded @entity110 markets , many @entity3 headdresses now also include plastic flowers beautiful : both of these women are from the @entity4 tribe , a group closely related to the @entity3 who inhabit the @entity117 in northern @entity5 modern : 16 - year - old @entity118 is one of the few @entity3 to go to school and as a result , she has ditched most items of traditional dress with the exception of her collar grisly : both tribes drink cow 's blood and milk ' smoothies '			1
blood is taken with the help of a specially made arrow that pierces the vein without killing the cow ' before getting married , teenagers enjoy a degree of sexual freedom and wear heavy beaded necklaces given to them by their boyfriends - a @entity140 ( warrior ) usually from her clan or even her family			1
' each girl is given a house by her parents where she can entertain her warrior openly , while the men spend up to $ 100 ( £ 58 ) - a huge amount of money for the @entity3 - on elaborate necklaces for their ' nekarai '			1
as a result , scraping together the cash to pay for a necklace can include some illegal business			0
' to show my love for my girlfriend , i need to buy her a huge necklace , ' says 18 - year - old warrior @entity160			0
' but the price is too high for me , so i have to conduct a raid with my friends on the neighbouring tribes to steal some cows			0
then i ’ll sell the cows to get some money '			0
' once i get married , i will have to remove the necklace offered to me by my boyfriend , ' adds 15 - year - old @entity171			0
' i will have to give it back to him , and i will need to forget him as my parents have already chosen another man for me , from another clan			0
' engaged : 15 - year - old @entity171 is engaged to a man who is n't her boyfriend and will have to return this elaborate collar to him when she gets married married : women who are married wear elaborate brass earrings and layer on necklaces , the colours of which have different meanings and reflect her status pastoralists : both @entity3 and @entity4 tribes are semi-nomadic pastoralists who rely on their livestock , including huge flocks of goats , to survive similarities : as well as being pastoralists , both @entity3 and @entity4 live mostly on cow blood and milk ' smoothies ' and adore colourful beads symbolic : women whose first born child is a son wear extra earrings as do those who have managed to add several boys to their clan spectacular : like the @entity3 , @entity4 women wear elaborate beaded collars , decorative headdresses and , once married , heavy brass earrings camps in @entity214 include @entity215 , which is situated on a rocky ridge above the banks of the @entity218 with remarkable views across the @entity220 toward @entity5			1

for more information on visiting @entity5 , see @entity232 when @entity171 does marry , she will trade her huge , elaborate necklace for a pair of brass earrings , which symbolise marriage in @entity3 culture			1
should she have sons , she will add another : the @entity241			0
married women also wear elaborate headdresses made from entai ( buttons ) , ntarangrang ( sequins ) and sayen ( beads ) to show off their status and their husband 's wealth			1
' @entity4 women also wear the @entity250 or wedding necklace for ceremonies , ' adds @entity15			2
' they used to make them from giraffe or elephant tail hair but because hunting is banned , they use fibre from doum palm fronds to make them instead			0
' @entity4 women are also famous for their elaborate doko hairstyles ; an ochre daubed crest that tells anyone looking at them that their first child was a son and which they wear until their son or his father dies			2
' the doko was made with the own hair of the woman so they could n't remove it , ' adds @entity15			0
' today , they wear an removable version made using palm fibre , red ochre and butter			0
' but it 's the beads that offer the most clues to a @entity4 or @entity3 woman 's lifestyle , with different colours revealing different aspects of her personality , status and health			1
@entity287 stands for purity and good health because it represents milk which comes from a cow , black is hardship , yellow and orange melded signify hospitality because they are the colours of animal skins laid out on guest beds			2
@entity299 signifies danger , bravery and unity			0
' necklaces can even have magic powers , ' notes @entity15			0
' if a woman is sterile , she must see a witch doctor who will give her a collar of pearls			0
she must go to the first born man in any house , tie him up with the necklace and then leave with it			0
' three months later , she ought to be pregnant , while the man that she tied up with the necklace will become crazy or sick as in @entity3 culture , the fortune of one will be the misfortune of the other			0
' meaningful : different colours have different meanings with white standing for purity and health because of its association with cow 's milk headdress : head decorations are made from entai ( buttons ) , ntarangrang ( sequins ) and sayen ( beads ) - all of which are expensive and denote wealth mothers : the @entity3 woman ( left ) and the @entity4 lady ( right ) both have sons - an earring denotes it for the @entity3 while the doko hairstyle is the @entity4 equivalent home : a group of @entity4 women in their village or ' gob '			1
villages are designed to be picked up and moved , with the tribe changing location five times a year colourful : the elaborate beads are worn with brightly coloured kikoy wraps that come in every hue imaginable from bright pink to saffron yellow elaborate : beaded jewellery is n't limited to women : men also wear elaborate headdresses and beautifully worked collars , as well as armfuls of bracelets warriors : the @entity3 tribe 's young men , or @entity140 as they are also known , don elaborate beaded collars and headdresses for ceremonies			1
