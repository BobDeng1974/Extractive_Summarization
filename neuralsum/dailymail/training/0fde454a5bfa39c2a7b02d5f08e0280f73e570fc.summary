as a 26 - year - old former circus chimp , he may not be able to understand the legal terminology			1
but @entity3 the chimpanzee certainly got his day in court yesterday – as part of a two - year bid to prove he is human			1
activists say the primate is a prisoner because he spends his retirement with his owners in a trailer park watching television			1
yesterday a lawyer representing the animal told an @entity19 court his client had been ‘ unlawfully imprisoned ’ in a cage and should be released			1
if activists win their case , @entity3 will be the first animal declared a person – with the same rights as humans – under @entity19 law			2
@entity3 , a 26 - year - old former circus chimp , is currently at the centre of a two - year legal battle in the @entity19 attorney @entity31 , of the @entity32 , said the chimp - a 26 - year - old former circus act - had been being ‘ unlawfully imprisoned ’ in a cage by his owners and should be released to be a primate sanctuary they are calling for the ageing chimp to be released to live out his days with others of his kind in a primate sanctuary in @entity42			1
@entity3 is kept alone by his owners , @entity44 and @entity45 , along with other exotic animals at a trailer park in @entity48			1
lawyer @entity49 argued that @entity3 was being kept in what he described as ‘ a cavernous dark shed ’			2
he said the chimpanzee was a ‘ legal person ’ , entitled to freedom from captivity , the @entity52 reported			1
in a hearing before the @entity59 appeals division , mr @entity31 called for the case to be considered under the category of ‘ unlawful imprisonment ’ – instead of animal welfare laws			0
mr @entity31 , who is fighting for the chimp ’s rights on behalf of activists with the @entity32 , said @entity3 should be treated as a ‘ habeas corpus ’ – a law which requires a prisoner or detainee to be brought before a judge			1
in an emotional plea mr @entity31 told the court : ‘ as a matter of both liberty and equality , @entity3 should be seen as a person			2
’ attorney @entity31 , of the @entity32 , argues on behalf of @entity3 the chimp before the @entity79			2
the court will decide whether the animal should be declared a ' person ' @entity3 was not in court and nor was his owner			0
but mr @entity84 has previously described the chimp as having ‘ a lot of enrichment ’			0
he told an @entity19 newspaper : ‘ he ’s got colour tv , cable and a stereo			0
he likes being by himself			0
’ the case was thrown out by a lower court in december , when a judge said mr @entity31 had made ‘ a very strong argument ’ but he did not agree that habeas corpus applies to chimpanzees			0
yesterday , five judges appeared sceptical , expressing doubt that ‘ personhood ’ could be conferred on a non-human			0
they will issue their ruling at a later date .			0
