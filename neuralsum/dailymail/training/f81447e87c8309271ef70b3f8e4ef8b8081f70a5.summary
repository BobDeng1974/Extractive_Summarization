when the final @entity1 is announced at the @entity3 award ceremony at the @entity4 in @entity5 on january 12 , it could end up reading a lot like one of @entity9 's team - sheets			1
@entity10 have one goalkeeper , five defenders , three midfielders and three strikers in the 55 - player shortlist			0
coach @entity9 could also pick up the manger 's gong and @entity18 , with a record breaking 17 goals in last season 's @entity22 campaign , is favourite to win the main prize – the @entity3			1
@entity10 forward @entity18 is favourite to retain his @entity3 crown in @entity5 next month @entity9 could claim @entity1 's coach of the year award after leading real to @entity22 glory @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 ; @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 ; @entity37 , @entity18 , @entity38 * @entity10 players in bold the current @entity41 champions are on a run of 17 straight wins that should extend to 20 with home games against @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 to come before they travel to @entity49 where they will play the @entity51			1
by the time the awards ceremony comes around they could be sat on top of the world , as well as favourites to become the first side ever to retain the @entity22			1
the manner in which they have won their last five @entity22 games has seen to that			0
their @entity63 form – brushing aside @entity64 when the two teams in met in october - has them on top and expected to take that crown , too			2
when @entity1 finally announce their team of teams @entity10 will have to cede some territory to other clubs			1
after a poor @entity51 , @entity71 maybe be back to his best in @entity63 but it will surely be too late to prevent @entity29 from being voted best goalkeeper			0
@entity73 's @entity31 should be picked in the defence and that will mean that @entity32 and @entity76 – both worthy of spots in the @entity1 – will have to contest the other centre - back position			2
as one of the @entity3 finalists @entity38 will make the team so @entity10 's @entity83 forward line of @entity37 , @entity84 and @entity18 will not be able to make a clean sweep of the front three			1
@entity87 @entity37 has been nominated for @entity88 's @entity1 after a fine first season in @entity10 summer signing @entity34 , pictured scoring against @entity92 , is one @entity1 's nominated midfielders @entity3 : @entity18 best goalkeeper : @entity71 best defenders : @entity30 , @entity32 , @entity76 , @entity95 , @entity96 best midfielders : @entity35 , @entity34 , @entity98 best forwards : @entity18 , @entity37 , @entity84 the midfield could well be made up of current @entity10 stars and players who were integral to @entity10 's success last season - @entity98 , @entity34 and @entity35 are in competition with @entity36 and @entity105			1
whatever shape the final team takes it could comfortably have five @entity10 players in it , plus those sold in the summer			2
and the powers that be at the @entity111 wo n't even mind if players let go in august make the cut			0
such has been the success of new faces @entity35 and @entity34 that the sales of @entity105 and @entity117 , that stung so much at the start of the season , now no longer trouble supporters			0
@entity34 already has nine goals – just two short of @entity117 's total of 11 for the last campaign			0
it now looks a masterstroke especially as the @entity128 star is on £ 1.5million - a - year less than the @entity129 would have cost under the terms of the new deal he felt – with some justification after his brilliant season – that he deserved			0
scooping the individual prizes in @entity5 in january will be no guarantee that come the end of the season @entity10 will have another cupboard full of trophies but there does seem to be a drive about the squad that is missing both from @entity64 and some of the teams they are likely to come up against in the @entity22 knockout stages			2
a clean sweep in the @entity1 team is unlikely but they look on course to go on dominating football for some time			0

@entity10 have 12 players nominated for @entity88 's @entity1
@entity18 is favourite to retain his @entity3 title
@entity10 are top of @entity63 and *flying* in the @entity22
@entity9 could also win @entity1 's coach of the year award
