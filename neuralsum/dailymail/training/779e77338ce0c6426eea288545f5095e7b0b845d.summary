blue light observations of a super-earth 40 light years from our planet suggest that it is a world with a thick , steamy water - rich atmosphere			1
@entity6 astronomers used the @entity8 telescope to observe planetary transits of the super-earth , which is located at the centre of the @entity12			1
astronomers had previously confirmed that this alien world has a thick atmosphere , but were unable to determine whether the atmosphere was primarily hydrogen or a steamy soup of water vapour			0
their findings confirm that the super-earth has an atmosphere rich in water rather than hydrogen			0

the blue sphere represents the host star @entity29 , and the black ball in front of it on the right is @entity29 b the water world , named @entity37 is one of the more well - known super-earths and was discovered by the ground - based @entity40 in 2009			1
this super-earth is about 2.6 times @entity43 ’s diameter and weighs almost seven times as much			1
it orbits a red - dwarf star every 38 hours at a distance of 2 million kilometres , giving it an estimated temperature of 230 degrees @entity50			0

super-earths are exoplanets orbiting a star outside of the solar system that are larger than @entity43 's but smaller than those of ice giants such as @entity64 or @entity65			1
their planetary transits enable scientists to find changes in the wavelength in the brightness of the star , which indicate the planet 's atmospheric composition			1
if scientists can determine the major atmospheric component of a super-earth , they can then find out the planet 's birthplace and formation history			1
the water world , named @entity37 is one of the more well - known super-earths and was discovered by the ground - based @entity40 in 2009			1
this super-earth is about 2.6 times @entity43 ’s diameter and weighs almost seven times as much			1
if the sky has a hydrogen - dominated atmosphere ( as shown in the top image ) @entity88 scattering disperses blue light from the atmosphere of the host			0
the middle image shows how @entity88 scattering is much weaker in water - rich atmospheres while the bottom image show what would happen if the sky had extensive clouds it orbits a red - dwarf star every 38 hours at a distance of 2 million kilometres , giving it an estimated temperature of 230 degrees @entity50			0
last year , the @entity107 space telescope examined gj 1214b when it crossed in front of its host star			0
during such a transit , the star ’s light is filtered through the planet ’s atmosphere , giving clues to the mix of gases			2
they found the spectrum of @entity37 to be featureless over a wide range of wavelengths , or colours , also suggesting the planet had a dense atmosphere of water vapour			2
the planet @entity37 , shown here in an artist 's conception with two hypothetical moons , orbits a star 40 light - years from @entity43			1
the super-earth is about 2.6 times @entity43 's diameter and weighs seven times as much @entity8 found weak @entity88 scattering in the optical wavelength which the team claim provided ‘ powerful evidence ’ for a water - dominated atmosphere			1
another possibility for the weak @entity142 scattering is that the planet has a hydrogen - dominated atmosphere with extensive clouds			2
@entity88 scattering occurs when light particles scatter in a medium without a change in wavelength			0
in a water - rich atmosphere , such as the one on @entity37 , the effect of the @entity88 scattering is much weaker than in a hydrogen - dominated atmosphere			2
up until now , more than 800 exoplanets have been discovered and around so far and 12 are thought to have the environments that could be habitable			0
more unusual discoveries include a planet that is as airy as @entity158 , and another that rains glass			0
researchers claim there could be as many as 100 billion @entity43 - like planets in the @entity12			2
astronomers , however , claim the temperature on @entity37 is probably far too high for life to exist there .			0

@entity37 is 2.6 times @entity43 ’s diameter and weighs seven times as much
it was first discovered as part of the ground - based @entity40 in 2009
the observations by the @entity8 telescope could help scientists find out more about the planet 's birthplace and formation history
