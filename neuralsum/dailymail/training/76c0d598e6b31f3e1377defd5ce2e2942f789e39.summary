while unemployment is falling , this includes many who have been out of work for only a few weeks or months while long - term unemployment remains worryingly high			1
the prime minister said long - term unemployment remains ‘ stubbornly high ’ , adding : ‘ it is still a problem			1
’ of the 2.51million unemployed , 904,000 – more than a third – have been out of work for more than 12 months			0
