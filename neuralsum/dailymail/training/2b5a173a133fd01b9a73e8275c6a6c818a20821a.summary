by @entity0 published : 21:01 est , 19 february 2013 @entity2 : 08:15 est , 20 february 2013 a microchip developed by scientists has restored the sight of nine blind people suffering from a degenerative disease after it was inserted into their eyes			2
once positioned at the rear of the eyeball , the implant restored functional vision to the patients born with the hereditary condition retinitis pigmentosa ( @entity15 )			1
the 3mm chip may provide the 15 million people left blinded by the disease a means of partially restoring their vision			1
x-ray : scientists at @entity24 's @entity23 placed the 3mm chip at the rear of the eyeball of patients suffering from retinitis pigmentosa ( @entity15 ) the tiny implant , developed by scientists at @entity24 's @entity23 , is placed below the surface of the retina where it electrically stimulates optical tissues			1
in the latest trials , described in the @entity35 's biological research journal @entity36 , most of the patients involved were able to recognise facial expressions			1
they could also distinguish objects such as fruit on a table and read road signs			2
sight sharpness for two of them also surpassed the visual resolution achieved in earlier human trials involving 27 patients			2
professor @entity51 , of @entity23 's @entity52 , said trials ' exceeded expectations ' he said : ' as physicians we are constantly seeking out the best treatment options for our most in - need patients which most definitely includes those suffering from advanced - stage retinitis pigmentosa			1
stimulant : the tiny implant was placed below the surface of the retina where it electrically stimulates optical tissues blind : @entity15 is a disease that mainly affects the retina , specifically , the photoreceptors in the macular layer , which slowly degrade until the patient goes blind ' this research provides additional evidence our sub-retinal implant technology can help some patients with retinal degeneration regain functional vision and does so in a way that does not require externally visible equipment			2
' @entity15 is a disease that mainly affects the retina - specifically , the photoreceptors in the macular layer , which slowly degrade until the patient goes blind			0
although the disease is incurable , the nerves of the retina remain functional in one bright spot			0
if these nerves can be stimulated then some form of vision might be recovered			0
the light - sensitive , externally powered microchip is surgically implanted beneath the retina and into the macular region			0
this is the area of the eye where clear images are formed in normal - sighted individuals			0
the chip is made up of 1,500 pixels each with its own amplifier and electrode for stimulating the retinal nerves			1
improvement : in the latest trials , described in @entity35 's biological research journal @entity36 , most of the patients involved were able to recognise facial expressions in addition there are 16 electrodes to stimulate the nerves directly - producing some degree of artificial vision in the form of lines and colours the patient learns to interpret			1
@entity120 , chief executive of @entity122 in @entity24 , which has manufactured the implant , said : ' the continuation of our trial is the next milestone in our quest to provide @entity15 patients living in darkness with a treatment option			0
' we are continually humbled by the 36 patients we 've implanted so far and their willingness to participate in this ground - breaking research			0
' @entity135 , chief executive of @entity136 , said : ' as a leading relevant patient organisation in the @entity138 we have been watching @entity122 's research with great interest			0
' the results published today show definite promise to one day restore functional vision to patients with advanced - stage retinitis pigmentosa			1

the implant partially restored vision in retinitis pigmentosa sufferers
the 3mm chip made up of 1,500 pixels was placed at the rear of the eyeball
patients were able to recognise facial expressions and distinguish objects
scientists at @entity23 said the trials ' exceeded expectations '
