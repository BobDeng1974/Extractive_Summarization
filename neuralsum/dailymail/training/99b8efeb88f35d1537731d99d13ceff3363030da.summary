a woman police chief has come under fire for seeming to defend a colleague who described a shooting victim ’s fiancee as ‘ some bit of skirt ’			1
@entity8 , @entity9 ’s chief constable , said the comment – made by an investigation during a fly - on - the - wall tv documentary about @entity14 – was ‘ forgivable ’			1
the first episode follows the arrest and questioning of a suspect in the shooting of accountant @entity19			2
in the @entity28 programme , detective constable @entity21 is shown referring to mr @entity19 ’s then fiancee as ‘ some bit of skirt ’			1
he is later filmed saying to colleagues : ‘ what ’s this girl like then ? is she a bit of a looker ? why would you want to do 15 years in prison ? ’ mrs @entity8 admitted ‘ wincing ’ when she watched the footage , but insisted : ‘ it ’s forgivable but not what i would want someone to say			2
‘ i made it clear when i was asked about some of the language used by officers and staff at the advanced press screening that there are things shown in the series which i do not enjoy seeing			0
swearing and off - hand comments about others in the office environment is not what i want to see from my staff			0
but i do accept that the round - the - clock filming over six weeks in a tough and tiring environment was always going to produce a few moments where officers would express their frustrations and it would make me wince – they are only human			0
' mr @entity19 , who needed surgery after being shot in the leg , told the @entity81 he felt ‘ sick ’ at the comments			1
he added : ‘ if this is true , then i do n’t accept it is banter			0
it is highly disrespectful from someone who is supposed to uphold the highest morals and ethics			0
’ detective constable @entity89 has been compared to the @entity91 's @entity90 for his cringeworthy role in the documentary series , including a moment where he shows a colleague pictures of cheese sauce on a burger that he ate mr @entity21 is also shown squeezing a squeaking rubber chicken when the suspect is charged , saying : ‘ it gets squeezed when we get a good result			1
’ mrs @entity8 confirmed that she had spoken to @entity103 about his insensitive remark			2
she said he had tole her there was no intention to cause offence to mr @entity19 or his fiancee , merely a desire to gather evidence			1
at the same press conference when mrs @entity8 made her comments , it emerged some officers had refused to appear in the programme because they were paying child maintenance and did not want ex-partners to know they had been promoted			2
the first episode also shows a female desk sergeant saying she needs to get home ‘ before i punch somebody ’ , while booking in a man who smashed a door at his mother ’s home because his games console was broken			0
another officer involved in mr @entity19 ’s case , detective constable @entity89 , has been compared to @entity91 ’s hapless @entity90 following his appearance on the documentary			1
he talks incessantly about a recent holiday to @entity133 and shows a bored - looking colleague pictures of some cheese sauce he had on a burger			0
the 20 - part series , 24 hours in @entity27 , starts at 9pm tonight			1
it was filmed in april and may by @entity139 , which was behind @entity28 ’s 24 hours in @entity140			1
future episodes will cover issues such as child sex abuse , domestic violence and drugs			0
the force waived any control over content except in two cases because of ‘ family and legal reasons ’			0
last week it emerged @entity9 ’s deputy police and crime commissioner , @entity154 , 32 , was forced to step down after she attempted to gag the court in mr @entity19 ’s case			2
she tried to prevent his ex-fiancee – a distant cousin of hers – being named in coverage .			0

detective constable @entity161 was caught on *camera* making the remark
he was being filmed as part of @entity28 's 24 hours in @entity27 series
officer was filmed asking if the fiancee of victim @entity19 was ' a bit of a looker '
but chief constable @entity8 dismisses the comments as office ' banter '
mr @entity19 told the @entity81 that the ' disrespectful ' comments made him feel ' sick '
