by @entity0 world indoor bronze medallist @entity1 saw his hopes of a 800m @entity5 medal ended by a disqualification after tangling with @entity8 ' @entity7 just before they crossed the line on tuesday			1
the pair exchanged cross words after finishing , @entity1 coming home in third and @entity7 , in fourth , but the @entity15 was bumped up a place after the officials took exception to his rival 's actions and qualified for the semi-finals			1
in the way : @entity22 's @entity1 ( second left ) tussles with @entity8 runner @entity7 flashpoint : @entity1 stumbles after the collision with @entity7 at the finish line @entity22 have appealed against the disqualification and @entity1 , who did appear to block @entity7 off down the inside , said he did nothing wrong			1
the @entity31 athlete said : ' there was a scuffle , there were people looking for gaps that were n't there			0
at that sort of pace , everyone comes into play			0
' i would say it was not his space , you can always go round people			0
if you do n't you will cause a collision			0
that happened to me at the trials and somebody clipped my hamstring , and that has affected me coming into these championships			0
' elsewhere , @entity55 , whose 800m @entity58 gold and world record in @entity59 provided one of the highlights of those games , treated @entity63 to a dominant qualifying run			2
the @entity65 , back after injury ruled him out of the 2013 @entity68 , produced a customary display of front - running to win his heat in one minute and 46.89 secs			2
@entity22 's @entity71 lay third and @entity73 fourth after seven events of the decathlon , while , in the absence of @entity78 and @entity79 , @entity76 lay third after two events of the heptathlon			2
