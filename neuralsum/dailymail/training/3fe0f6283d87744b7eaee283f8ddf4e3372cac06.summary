by @entity0 for @entity1 new smile : @entity3 , 68 , had £ 30,000 implants in 2012 @entity3 , 68 , a retired sales manager from @entity5 , had implants in october 2012 after separating from her husband of 15 years			1
she says : ‘ over the decades i have spent thousands on twice - yearly visits to the dentist			1
‘ because i have a small jaw , my teeth are overcrowded , causing constant infections			1
‘ i also had wisdom teeth problems , and two front teeth that came through the same socket			1
‘ during one visit seven years ago , i had nine teeth removed at once and four bridges , or fake teeth , fitted in their place			1
' it was a nightmare			0
i learned to deal with it by grinning , rather than smiling , but the state of my teeth was always on my mind			1
‘ in 2008 , my marriage broke down irreversibly			0
' for a long time i was tearful , before i realised that , as a single woman , i had to take control of myself			0
‘ in addition to sorting out my finances , and buying my very first car , i decided to sort out my teeth			2
' i wanted to feel pretty and proud of myself again			0
‘ i saw an advert for @entity35 in the summer of 2012			2
' i baulked at the £ 30,000 cost of implants , before remembering the thousands i ’d spent at the dentist throughout my life , and took the money from my savings			1
‘ a consultation revealed that my teeth were in such a bad state i ’d have to have all the remaining ones taken out , but thanks to the sedative i have no recollection of the operation			2
on the bright side , i was delighted to discover i ’d lost 9 lb ! ‘ my final set of teeth were fitted four months later			1
i ’m thrilled – nobody would ever guess they ’re not my own			0
' i brush them well and have them polished every six months			0
i ’m still single but love life			0
' last september i even went for a cruise around the @entity64 on my own , which i ’d never have had the confidence to do before			2
' best of all , i can smile at anyone and finally feel attractive again			0

@entity3 had constant infections *due* to an overcrowded mouth
she spent £ 30,000 on a full set of implants in 2012 after her *divorce*
she says new teeth gave her the confidence to smile - and travel
