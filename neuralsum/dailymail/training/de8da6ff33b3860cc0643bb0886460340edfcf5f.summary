by @entity1 reporter @entity2 was held in custody for two weeks after @entity4 , 26 , told police she had ' covered her ears as he killed ' @entity8 in her bedroom of the house she shared with her fellow student in @entity12			1
as a result of the false accusation , @entity2 was dragged from his home in front of his children and wife in a dawn raid and taken to jail only being released when a university professor provided him with a rock solid alibi			1
guilt : @entity24 has spoken of her regret at falsely accusing @entity27 barman @entity8 of the murder of @entity30 student @entity8 in @entity12 falsely accused : @entity2 was held in custody for two weeks because of @entity4 's claims - he later won damages for the ordeal @entity4 in 2007 with then boyfriend @entity35 , who was also reconvicted of @entity8 's murder last month now @entity4 , who was last month re-convicted along with ex-boyfriend @entity35 for @entity8 's killing in @entity38 in 2007 , has admitted her guilt at accusing @entity40 , which she has always claimed was as a result of pressure from police			1
in a wide - ranging interview with the @entity46 , she told how she has ' really struggled with what happened with @entity48 ' and , asked if she could understand why he hated her , replied : ' yes , @entity48 was greatly hurt by what happened and never got answers from me			0
' granted , i was in a position where i could n't give answers			0
but if you read what i said after my interrogations , i said i could not testify against him , and yet his lawyer continues to say i was going to let him languish in prison ... ' @entity4 said her false confession was as a result of threats from police and the mental strain caused by their interrogations			1
tragic : @entity4 says she still hopes to convince the @entity70 family of her innocence and said she was still ' traumatised ' by @entity8 's death recalling the moment she made her false accusation , she said : ' when i named @entity48 , i just started weeping			1
i thought , " @entity76 " , it must be true what they 're ( the police ) saying			0
i must have witnessed my friend 's murder somehow and now i 'm traumatised enough to not even remember it			2
' @entity4 was convicted of slandering @entity2 and ordered to pay him 22,000 euros in 2011 , and he was also later awarded 8,000 euros in damages by the @entity12 state but he rejected this to pursue a claim through the @entity87			2
@entity4 , who was this week given a lifeline when it emerged the judge who convicted her of the crime for a second time may have breached legal rules , also spoke of her determination to convince the @entity70 family of her innocence , although she admitted it was a ' really big rock to overturn '			1
the @entity100 native , who is back studying in her home city , said she felt stranded and trapped by the latest verdict and was uncomfortable that the decision of a judge had cemented her reputation as a criminal in the eyes of the public			2
she also said it was a struggle when meeting people at her college when new acquaintances realised her identity			0
@entity4 , who maintains police have not a shred of evidence that she committed any crime , added she was trying to stay positive about her future			0
@entity4 is trying to build a new life back in @entity121 with boyfriend @entity122 @entity4 and @entity35 were charged with murdering and sexually assaulting @entity8 in 2007 , after she was found semi-naked and with her throat cut in the bedroom of her house in @entity38			1
initially , both were convicted in 2009 and @entity4 was sentenced to 26 years and @entity35 to 25 years but then in 2011 the verdicts were sensationally overturned and both were allowed to go free			0
but last year , in a case that has been marked with numerous twists and turns , @entity12 's @entity130 ordered a fresh retrial of the appeal and she was re-convicted last month			0
she 's been warned she faces extradition to @entity12 if she leaves @entity121 .			0

@entity4 says she still ' struggles ' at *wrongly* accusing @entity8
*insists* lawyers were wrong to say she was happy to let him languish in jail
claims she remains ' traumatised ' over @entity8 's 2007 death
admits proving innocence to @entity70 family is ' big rock to overturn '
says she feels ' trapped ' , ' *desperate* ' and ' stranded ' in wake of re-conviction
