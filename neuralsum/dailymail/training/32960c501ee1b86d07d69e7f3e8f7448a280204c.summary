critics say the supposedly tough new crime of ‘ aggravated ’ knife possession is simply being ignored by the courts			1

two years ago , the prime minister announced that courts would be forced to put knife thugs in jail for between six months and four years if they threatened the public			1
mr @entity3 said : ‘ far too many people still think they can go out armed with a knife			2
we need to send the clearest possible message that this simply has to change			0
’ the move was an attempt to mollify campaigners furious at the ditching of a @entity38 manifesto pledge to jail anyone caught carrying a knife			0
that policy was ruled out as too costly because it would have meant jailing up to 8,000 people			0
the less stringent offence of aggravated knife possession – which applies to those carrying knives who behave threateningly – came into force on december 3 last year			1
but figures released by the @entity50 yesterday show that in the first six months of this year , 63 people were found guilty of the offence , of whom just 27 were sent to jail			0
