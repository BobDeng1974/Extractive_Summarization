by @entity0 published : 20:14 est , 22 march 2013 updated : 20:15 est , 22 march 2013 the cost of paying gold - plated pensions to @entity5 ’s public sector workers will balloon by nearly 60 per cent over the next five years , official forecasts revealed this week			1
experts warned it makes a mockery of the government ’s claim to have tackled the problem of the crippling cost of paying such generous pensions to the state workforce			2
under the deal , hammered out by ministers , public sector workers will have to work longer and pay more for their pensions and many will get less when they retire			1
contentious : last year ministers managed to force public sector workers to work longer and get less money for retirement , leading to a strike , but they remain some of the most generous pensions in the country but they remain among the most generous retirement payouts in the country , according to the forecast from the government ’s independent financial watchdog published this week			1
between april 2012 and april 2013 , the cost of paying the pensions of retired @entity34 workers , teachers , civil servants and the @entity37 is £ 8.9billion			0
but this figure is set to rocket to £ 14.1billion five years later in the year 2017/18 , according to the @entity40			0
this is an increase of 58 per cent			0
to make matters worse , this is not even the full cost to the taxpayer of paying the pensions of all retired public sector workers			1
it does not include the cost of paying the pensions of many other types of @entity52 workers , such as the police , firefighters , mps and local government workers			0
and the @entity40 ’s analysis , published in the @entity59 ’s so - called @entity58 , does not even include the full cost to the taxpayer of paying the pensions it does include			0
this is because it deducts the amount contributed by the employer into their workers ’ pensions - but the ‘ employer ’ is the @entity52 , paid for by taxpayers			2
@entity70 , a leading @entity71 lord and a former pensions spokesman , said : ‘ public sector pensions costs are due to rise by an eye - watering amount every year			1
‘ meanwhile private sector pensions are being squeezed and the @entity78 ’s quantitative easing programme is hammering annuity rates for private savers			2
‘ our coalition government has only half defused the ticking public sector pensions time bomb @entity85 left us			2
’ time bomb : lord @entity70 said that @entity85 had left behind ' eye - watering ' public sector rises while private sector pensions are being squeezed it comes as gold - plated pensions in the private sector are being shut down at the fastest rate on record , according to the @entity94 2005 , 43 per cent of defined benefit schemes allowed new recruits to a company to join			1
today the figure has collapsed to just 13 per cent following the biggest - ever drop last year.a defined benefit pension promises to pay a worker a certain pension when they retire , typically linked to their final salary or their average salary over their @entity112 , chief executive of the @entity114 , the campaign group , said : ‘ the growing burden of public sector pensions shows little sign of slowing despite government promises of reform			1
‘ unions have vociferously resisted even moderate reforms and it is taxpayers who are paying the price for that			0
‘ we ’re all living longer , and this bill is n’t getting any smaller			0
’ it comes as unions are plotting strike action over changes to their pensions as well as other @entity126 of the militant @entity127 walking out on @entity128 and teachers will walk out later this @entity130 says the government ’s reforms will save billions of pounds over the next few decades and have put public service pensions onto a sustainable footing .			0

public sector payouts will remain among the most generous in the country
@entity70 said they are due to rise by an ' eye - watering amount '
however private sector gold - plated pensions are ending at fastest ever rate
