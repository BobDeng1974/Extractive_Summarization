by @entity0 before her devastating descent into drug and alcohol abuse , @entity2 ’s abiding concern was to be a good mother to her four young children			1
in fact , the row that led up to the death of her partner , @entity10 , was about her kids			1
she wanted to take them to @entity15 to spend time as a family at @entity18			0
her estranged husband , @entity19 , was having none of it , rightly concerned about @entity10 ’s wild sex , drugs and rock ’ n ’ roll lifestyle			0
@entity10 hanged himself and , in despair , @entity2 spiralled out of control , dying from a heroin overdose three years later , when @entity29 was just 11			1
dedicated : before her devastating descent into drug and alcohol abuse , @entity2 's abiding concern was to be a good mother to her four young children			1
above , @entity2 is pictured with her daughter , @entity29 one can only imagine how terrible those years must have been for her children , as their mother battled her addictions and her grief , even clutching her dead lover ’s ashes in a pillow to her breast each night			1
as @entity29 would later recall : ‘ my mother , who was amazing , who wrote books on parenting , who gave us this idyllic childhood in @entity48			2
turned into this heartbroken shell of a woman who was just medicating to get through the day			1
’ small wonder that @entity29 said she could never get over her mother ’s death			2
even after the birth of her own two beautiful boys — @entity59 , almost two , and @entity60 , 11 months — the absence of her mother left a gaping hole in her life			1
fast forward 14 years and , with unbearable poignancy , her children will now inherit that same legacy of sorrow			1
for it is perhaps the greatest tragedy of @entity29 ’s sudden death that it has condemned her sons to grow up without a mother ’s love , just as she was obliged to herself			2
life of sorrow : even after @entity29 had her own two beautiful boys - @entity73 ( right ) , almost two , and @entity60 ( left ) , 11 months - the absence of her mother left a gaping hole in her life			1
she never got over her mother 's death whatever the cause of her death , that is surely the last thing @entity29 would have wanted			1
for while she had undoubtedly made many mistakes in her life , the former wild child had finally left her rock ’ n ’ roll lifestyle behind to concentrate on being the best mother she could be			1
she was happily married and had set up a country idyll for her children , posting pictures of them with the family dog , eating mashed potato , larking around , and doing all the things toddlers do			2
she had even started writing for @entity94 , just as @entity2 had written books about the joy of being a stay - at - home mum in the years before she met @entity10			1
happier times : fast forward 14 years and , with unbearable poignancy , @entity29 's children will now inherit that same legacy of sorrow			1
above , the model and journalist is pictured with her sons and husband , @entity107 one of the last images @entity29 posted on @entity109 was of her boys ’ @entity112 display , with homemade cards , daffodils , and chocolate eggs that now will never be eaten			0
yet , in a curious way , @entity29 ’s life mirrored her mother ’s in reverse			2
while @entity2 was the doting mother who only descended into drug abuse in later life , @entity29 was immersed in that world from a terrifyingly young age			1
in 2008 , aged 19 , she was filmed buying drugs from a dealer in a seedy @entity126 flat			0
later that year , @entity29 stopped breathing for several minutes after a suspected heroin overdose			2
she refused to go to hospital in case her father found out			0
former couple : @entity2 is pictured with her ex-partner , @entity10 , who later hanged himself happy family : @entity2 is seen here with her ex-husband sir @entity19 and three children at @entity136 in 1992 she dismissed it as ‘ a bad experience ’ and ‘ something people go through , especially growing up in @entity126 ’			1
she told one interviewer : ‘ you have to live on the edge as the edge is where you find out who you are			0
’ one of her lovers even blogged about their sex sessions , enhanced by injecting ‘ lemon heroin ’ and , in 2011 , there were pictures of her in a five - in - a - bed sex session			0
again , she collapsed , this time in her @entity154 home , in ‘ respiratory arrest ’			0
changed woman : after having a family and moving to the country , @entity29 grew up at last that all changed when she married @entity160 , had a family and moved to the country			0
@entity29 , by all accounts , had grown up at last , becoming a contented , considerate young woman			0
but who knows what deadly toll the years of abuse took on her young body			2
recently , she appeared painfully and dangerously thin , thanks to the juice - only diets that helped her lose weight			0
being a new mum can be draining for a young woman at the best of times — all the more so without her own mother on hand to lend advice and support — and @entity29 increasingly sought friendship from her 200,000 @entity109 followers , with whom she discussed exhaustion , her baby ’s teething troubles and her domestic struggles			2
ultimately , though , the platitudes and vacuities of the @entity187 are no substitute for true support in life any more than they are in death , as strangers and hangers - on now rush to tweet their personal devastation			2
@entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 — they were all at it on monday , in a predictable show of public mourning			0
how much more meaningful if they ’d sent a private letter to her father or husband , rather than a shallow , self - aggrandising tweet , wallowing in the wave of collective hysteria			0
it was n’t the approval of strangers that @entity29 needed , it was a mother ’s unconditional love			0
a love that she pledged she would give to her own children for ever			0
as she wrote for @entity219 a month ago : ‘ after years of struggling to know myself , lost at sea , rudderless and troubled			0
i felt finally anchored in place , with lives that literally depend on me , and i am not about to let them down , not for anyone or anything			0
’ one can only hope it will be some solace for those two baby boys as they grow up to know that , unlike their grandmother @entity2 , @entity29 seemed to have left her dark days behind her and was focused on giving them the love and stability of ‘ a mummy and daddy together for ever ’			1

before descent into drug abuse , @entity2 *aspired* to be good mother
she later turned into ' heartbroken shell of woman ' after partner 's death
peaches was left with gaping hole in life when mother died from overdose
fast forward 14 years , her children will now inherit same legacy of sorrow
