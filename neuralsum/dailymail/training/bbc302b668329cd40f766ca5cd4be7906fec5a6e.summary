by @entity0 published : 20:56 est , 5 january 2013 updated : 12:06 est , 6 january 2013 a skydiver who died after his parachute failed to open during a jump has been named as 56 - year - old @entity4			1
mr @entity4 , from @entity5 , @entity6 , was killed instantly when he hit the ground at @entity8 near the town of @entity10 in @entity11 yesterday			1
the highly experienced skydiver , who had carried out up to 100 previous jumps , got into trouble when his first parachute malfunctioned during the 3,000ft jump and he failed to deploy his reserve in time to prevent him plummeting to his death			1
skydiver @entity4 , 56 , from @entity5 , plummeted to his death when his parachute failed to open during a 3,000ft fall @entity22 manager @entity21 declined to comment today and all jumping at the centre was suspended pending the outcome of the ongoing investigation			1
mr @entity4 had travelled from the central belt to jump at the weekend , but was known to club members as a semi-regular visitor to the @entity31 operation			1
a source said : ' he had been to @entity31 plenty of times and was a fairly experienced guy			2
he would probably have already completed between 50 and 100 jumps			0
married mr @entity4 was a keen and experienced skydiver , having taken part in up to 100 previous falls ' it 's a terrible tragedy and everyone 's thoughts go out to his family			1
he had a wife and he had been at @entity31 with a couple of teenage sons in the past			0
' it 's not entirely clear what happened during the jump and the @entity50 make it clear that members should not talk about accidents , so there 's nothing more i can say			0
' the victim is understood to have been one of several skydivers who carried out solo jumps on saturday from a height of around 3 - 4,000 feet			2
mr @entity4 on a previous jump			1
an investigation is continuing into exactly what went wrong			0
it is believed poor weather which forced the dive to be undertaken from a lower height may have played a part sources at the skydiving club where mr @entity4 met his death have been left devastated by the incident cloudy weather meant it was unsafe for the launch plane to go on higher before letting the skydivers jump			2
the minimum safe height is around 2,500 feet , while ideal conditions can see parachutists jump from 15,000 feet			0
there have been a number of incidents involving skydivers at the airfield in recent years , some of them fatal			1
in february last year an 18 - year old man had to be airlifted to hospital after his parachute failed to deploy during a jump			0
in august 2011 a 29 - year old woman survived after her parachute failed to open and she suffered a broken ankle			0
a 39 - year old man died at the airfield in 2004 after becoming detached from his equipment during a group jump			0
investigators are looking at the possibility that the relatively low launch height may have played a key role in the tragedy			2
the low height meant the first parachute would have deployed immediately upon leaving the aircraft			2
it is understood that mr @entity4 believed he had a problem with his initial parachute shortly after it opened and he took steps to discard it during his descent			2
however , the reserve parachute had not been pulled and investigators are probing whether the victim was too close to the ground by that stage for it to open and slow his fall efficiently			0
a police spokesman said : ' @entity120 can confirm that the identity of the person who tragically died in a parachute incident at @entity8 on january 5 , 2012 , is @entity4 , 56 , from the @entity125 area of @entity5			1
' enquiries are continuing today with the assistance from representatives of the @entity50			0
as with all sudden deaths , a full report will be submitted to the @entity131			0
