@entity0 was sued tuesday by a @entity2 woman who claims the comedian molested her in a bedroom of the @entity5 around 1974 when she was 15 years old			1
@entity7 's sexual battery lawsuit does not specify how much she is seeking from @entity0 , who has in recent weeks faced renewed accusations that he drugged and sexually assaulted more than a dozen women for many years			1
@entity7 's lawsuit filed in @entity11 , however , is the first time that a woman has claimed she was underage when she was abused , and it is the first lawsuit @entity0 has faced claiming sexual abuse since 2005			1
the lawsuit says the three played billiards , with the girls having to drink a beer every time @entity0 won a game			1
the lawsuit then states that @entity0 took them to the @entity5 after several drinks , and told the teenagers to lie and say they were 19 years old if asked			1
her lawsuit states @entity0 forced her to perform a sex act on him with his hand after she returned from the bathroom , with the actor waiting for her on a bed			1
sued : @entity44 ( above ) claimed @entity0 drugged and molested her in 2004 , and her case was settled out of court by the actor she also says he tried to put his hand down her pants			1
an email message sent to @entity0 's attorney @entity49 was not immediately returned			0
@entity49 has denied previous accusations or said the women raising the claims in interviews had been discredited			0
@entity49 's statement does not apply to a lawsuit brought in 2005 by @entity44 , who claimed @entity0 drugged and molested her at his suburban @entity58 mansion in 2004			1
@entity44 , who worked for the women 's basketball team at @entity61 , and @entity0 settled the case before trial			1
@entity0 resigned from the university 's board of trustees on monday			0
he had been the school 's public face , appearing in advertisements , fundraising campaigns and delivering commencement speeches			0
@entity0 , 77 , has never been criminally charged stemming from any of the sex - abuse allegations , many of which date back to the 1970s and 1980s			2
@entity7 claims she suffered severe emotional distress and that she discovered its impact on her within the past three years , which allows her to file the lawsuit under @entity2 law			1
' this traumatic incident , at such a tender age , has caused psychological damage and mental anguish for ( @entity83 ) that has caused significant problems throughout her life , ' the lawsuit states			0
interestingly enough , while @entity88 â€™s biography of @entity0 made no mention of any of these allegations , it did talk about how @entity0 was a frequent guest at the @entity5			1
underage : the lawsuit claims that @entity0 ( above with @entity5 founder @entity92 ) told the girls to lie and say they were 19 if asked @entity0 's laywer , @entity49 , released a statement last month calling recent rape allegations ' increasingly ridiculous ' and ' completely illogical			1
' ' this situation is an unprecedented example of the media 's breakneck rush to run stories without any corroboration or adherence to traditional journalistic standards , ' says @entity49			0
' over and over again , we have refuted these new unsubstantiated stories with documentary evidence , only to have a new uncorroborated story crop up out of the woodwork			0
when will it end ? ' he then closed by saying , ' it is long past time for this media vilification of mr. @entity0 to stop			2
' more than ten women have come forward in the last month saying they were attacked by @entity0 , with @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 the latest additions			0
four of the women claim they were teenagers at the time			0
one of the accusers is supermodel @entity122 , who claims that during a dinner in 1982 the actor gave her a pill and when she woke up he was on top of her			0
another four ladies ; @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 have all shared remarkably similar stories in which they claim to have shared a drink or a pill with @entity0 and then woken up after or while they say he was sexually assaulting them			2
also coming forward recently is @entity136 , wife of @entity138 star @entity137 , who says @entity0 tried to sexually assault her during a gathering at his house in 1967			2
what 's more , @entity0 allegedly tried to use a friend to help court @entity137 , and allegedly made his move on the former @entity146 just moments after his own wife , @entity147 , left the room			2
when asked to speak about these claims in an @entity151 interview , @entity0 said he had ' no response ' and ' no comment			0
' these continued allegations are having a major impact on @entity0 's work , with @entity157 postponing the airing of his new comedy special , @entity0 77 , which was due to air the day after @entity160 , and @entity161 pulling the plug on a comedy project they were developing with the @entity166 star			2
@entity167 has also announced they will no longer air reruns of @entity166 on the network .			0

@entity7 says she was sexually assaulted by @entity0 in 1974 when she was just 15 years old at the @entity5
she has now filed a lawsuit against the actor , saying that she met him on a film set and that he gave her *alcohol* before taking her to the mansion
she then says she was told to lie and say she was 19 , and that @entity0 forced her to perform a sex act on him with his hand
this is the first lawsuit @entity0 has faced since he settled one out of court in 2005
@entity7 is *arguing* the statute of *limitations* should not apply as she suffered severe emotional distress and only discovered its impact on her within the past three years
