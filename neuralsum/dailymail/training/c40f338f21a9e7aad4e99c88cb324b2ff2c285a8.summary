@entity0 began their @entity2 campaign with a 4 - 0 rout of @entity5 ’s @entity4 on monday and immediately vowed to lift the trophy in honour of stricken @entity9 star @entity8			1
a @entity11 hat - trick lit up @entity13 ’s @entity12 as @entity4 were flattened by a brilliant @entity15 performance and the sending - off of defender @entity16			1
afterwards , @entity0 ’s players revealed they had been heartened by news that @entity8 had left hospital for the first time since a skiing accident left him in a coma in @entity24 at the end of last year			1
heartening : @entity0 's players were boosted by the news @entity8 has left hospital for the first time since falling into a coma following a skiing accident @entity32 striker @entity31 — a close friend of the driver — said : ‘ it is important to all of us to hear the news that he ’s come out of hospital			1
he ’s doing well and he ’s getting better and it ’s really good news			1
‘ of course it helped us			2
when you hear the news about a good friend it always helps and you get a little bit of a boost and i was very happy when i heard			1
‘ he ’s a good guy and he ’s also crazy about football			2
maybe he watched the game or he knew about the result			2
yeah if we win the title of course it would also be for a good friend as well as ourselves			2
’ @entity0 surged into a two - goal lead in the first half and were able to switch to cruise control once @entity16 had been dismissed for a headbutt on @entity11			1
it seemed the correct decision and the @entity60 star will now miss the rest of the group stages			1
happy : @entity0 's players come together to celebrate the hat - trick by @entity11 ( left ) @entity4 coach @entity64 appeared to suggest @entity66 referee @entity65 was biased against his team , not only for that but for the 12th minute penalty that allowed @entity0 to take the lead			1
‘ the first half of the game — apart from our mistakes — had some things on behalf of the referee that penalised us , ’ said @entity64			1
‘ the sending off seemed to be forced and the penalty was the same			2
they were two things that led to us chasing the game			2
‘ i never said it was only the referee ’s fault			1
we made mistakes in defence and we showed a lack of accuracy			2
‘ compare that to the accuracy of the @entity15 and you see the difference			0
‘ but there seemed to be some bias towards the @entity15			0
the first was the penalty and the second was the sending off			0
’ ' unusual ' : @entity11 says he has a vague recollection of this incident which led to @entity16 's sending off @entity11 was able to offer his own view of the red card incident after being presented with the man of the match award after the game			1
he said : ‘ as far as the sending off is concerned it ’s unusual			0
i did n’t see a replay			0
i have a vague recollection			0
‘ his hand struck me in the face			0
i fell on my back and he approached me with his head towards mine			0
i ca n’t really recollect			0
‘ i ca n’t say if it ’s a red as that ’s not up to me			0
but the entire action from @entity16 was unnecessary			1
‘ i have scored a hat trick and that does n’t happen every day			0
i have had a good run in @entity122 and i wanted to carry that on			0
’ accusation : @entity4 coach @entity64 said there seemed to be ' bias ' towards @entity0 from the officials @entity0 would already appear to have one foot in the last 16 while @entity4 must beat @entity127 and @entity128 in their remaining group games to progress			1
@entity15 coach @entity131 said : ‘ @entity11 has an instinct to create danger and he scores from situations that you do n’t expect			1
‘ he makes diagonal runs and it ’s hard for opponents to track him			0
you ca n’t predict them and as an opponent he is difficult to face			0
‘ he has one aim and that is to score a goal			0
he is an innate scorer			0
