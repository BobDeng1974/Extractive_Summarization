it 's her first official visit abroad since announcing her pregnancy			0
and a protective prince @entity3 made sure he was alongside @entity4 every step of the way as the royal couple arrived in a chilly @entity8 on their highly anticipated trip to the @entity11			1
never more than a foot away from her side , an attentive @entity12 kept an arm almost constantly on the small of @entity4 's back , guiding her through the crowds			2
she told @entity35 : ' impending fatherhood has a habit of making subtle changes to a guy 's body language , and with his second child on the way @entity3 is no exception			2
' there 's a strong whiff of protective alpha signaling here , with his chest pat and hand - rubbing suggesting he 's pretty pleased with himself right now , and he takes the role of the " advanced party " in these poses , climbing out of the car first and rushing off to meet and greet while @entity4 catches up in his wake			1
' when they connect though there is a raft of mutual signals that are new to the couple 's repertoire			0
@entity3 's arm is placed protectively around his wife 's waist but she mirrors the gesture , forming a bonded pose that is more @entity66 red carpet than rather more formal @entity68 royals			1
' he face - checks her to read her emotions and his suppressed smile suggests pride as well as affection			0
@entity4 looks anything but fragile with a confident smile and walk but @entity3 still seems keen to play the more traditional protective role , especially now they are on tour abroad			1
' they 've arrived ! @entity3 and @entity4 stepped out of their suv to screaming crowds at @entity8 's @entity23 ' it 's good to be here ' : @entity3 gushed to door staff as he walked into the hotel hand - in - hand with @entity4 start of a jam - packed few days : the smiling couple will fit in a number of care center visits and dinners invited : guests arrive to the lavish dinner hosted by @entity95 the prince @entity3 and @entity4 attended last night guests : the @entity12 and @entity4 arrived in @entity8 on sunday , their first official visit to the @entity11 since a 2011 trip to @entity98 hottest ticket in town : @entity3 and @entity4 , who are expecting their second child in april , have scheduled a full slate of events in @entity8 , including a visit to the @entity106 and a basketball game between the @entity108 and the @entity109 exclusive : their visit also will include some events with other high - profile guests			1
former secretary of state @entity115 and daughter @entity116 are accompanying @entity3 and @entity4 to a @entity8 reception highlighting conservation efforts exiting their blacked - out suv at the exclusive @entity23 on sunday , the 32 - year - old @entity4 showed little sign of the illness that blighted her first weeks of pregnancy			1
now at five months , and proudly displaying a small but noticeable bump , @entity4 looked glowing as she smiled warmly at the waiting fans			0
but despite her seeming good health , @entity3 clearly is still concerned over her wellbeing			0
as well as shadowing @entity4 into their hotel , where they will stay for their two day visit , @entity3 continued to remain close to @entity4 when they couple stepped out hours later to attend a private dinner			1
once again the prince kept his arm firmly round @entity4 's waist as they descended the steps of the hotel surrounded by their security			0
the ‘ private ’ event , which is expected to raise hundreds of thousands of pounds for the couple ’s charitable foundation , is being held at the cavernous @entity146 apartment of @entity68 media and marketing mogul sir @entity95 , whose personal fortune is estimated at £ 174million			0
but this whirlwind evening looks set to set the pace for the couple 's jam - packed two days in @entity8			1
and it may be the rather frenzied nature of the visit which has @entity3 concerned for his wife			2
@entity4 's reported desire to join him in a climb the @entity158 today has no doubt increased the @entity3 's worries , but @entity4 seems determined not to let her second pregnancy slow her down			2
taking care : the @entity12 put a loving arm around his wife who is due to give birth in april royal blue : @entity168 made quite the fashion statement among black suits in a deep blue number private : just thirty hedge fund managers and financiers were invited to dine , starting with cocktails at 6.30pm			0
