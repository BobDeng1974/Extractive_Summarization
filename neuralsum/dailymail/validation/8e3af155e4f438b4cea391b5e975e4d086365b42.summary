@entity0 will kick off saturday 's game knowing precisely what they need to do to win the @entity3 and take huge momentum into the @entity5			1
they had a similar chance a year ago — although they did n’t play last — but blew it badly in @entity7			1
the common language of coaches in this position is ‘ let ’s win the game first , ’ but that is nonsense			1
this is not about beating @entity15 , it is about winning the title			1
they need a clear game plan to maximise points difference			1
nobody remembers who comes second			2
@entity23 's @entity0 will know exactly what they have to do to win the @entity3 when they kick off @entity25 breaks with the ball during the @entity0 captain 's run at @entity29 it is tempting to think @entity0 must throw caution to the wind and play a wild , attacking game			1
but if they get ahead of themselves and try to run up a big score early they could come horribly unstuck			2
this is not a bad @entity38 team — in fact i have never really seen a bad @entity38 team as they do have so much talent available			0
they do n’t look comfortable on or off the field but the @entity38 have a habit of performing under pressure and they ’re capable of beating @entity0			1
throughout this week , i would have gone through match scenarios with my captain , the scrum - halves and the fly - halves , discussing what decision we ’d make depending on how many points we need in the match			0
that would then be presented to the whole team so everyone is on message			0
@entity0 's players gather as head coach @entity60 looks on during the captain 's run @entity63 passes the ball during the @entity0 captain 's run ahead of the game with @entity15 @entity60 must make it clear to his players exactly what they need to do to win the title if @entity0 need a big score , @entity23 and the half - backs will face big decisions from the first minute			1
i hope @entity60 has made it clear to the players this week exactly how the day will pan out in terms of timings			0
as soon as the early games finish , the results should be up on the changing - room wall			0
the amount of points they need to win by should be printed in big , bold type			1
this is the day for real detail and no surprises , and finding out which players can really perform under pressure			0
@entity0 should be very pleased with the situation they find themselves in , especially after the hiding they received in @entity94			1
with the games falling as they do , i would n’t set out any directives for the team about watching them or not — it should be every individual ’s decision			0
personally , i would like to watch as much as possible ; if nothing else , it takes your mind off our game for a few minutes			1
some of the players may want to watch the @entity110 v @entity109 game while others wo n’t			1
they ’ll be warming up while the @entity115 v @entity114 game is being played so there ’s no question of them watching that , but i ’d let the players know i would be putting the score from the @entity114 game up on the board in the changing room at 4.30pm so they know precisely what ’s required of them			1
that can be broken down into six very clear areas			0
1 build the score it sounds easy , but it ’s critical			0
@entity15 are more susceptible than any international side if they are put under pressure and they have lost on their last three visits to @entity29			1
the best way to create pressure is to lead throughout			0
so @entity0 must try to ensure they take the lead early and force @entity15 to chase the game			1
they must take every penalty that is offered — if the referee , say , gives an advantage , decline it and take the points			0
take three points from drop - goal opportunities — never leave their 22 without points			0
@entity63 scores @entity0 's first try against @entity115 and they must build a score against @entity15 this game is crying out for three drop goals in the first 20 minutes , even if you do n’t score tries until later in the game			1
if opportunities arise , we must take them , something we failed to do against @entity115			2
2 maintain discipline @entity0 must be squeaky clean and aim to concede no more than four penalties in each half			1
the contact area and scrum will be key and @entity0 can not afford to gift @entity15 easy points			1
scrum - half @entity165 needs to establish a running dialogue with referee @entity168 and @entity0 must not allow @entity15 to have the ball at the breakdown			1
yellow or red cards must be seen as a total disaster , and every player must take full responsibility to control himself in every aspect of the game			2
scrum half @entity165 needs to establish a running dialogue with referee @entity168 3 keep the ball in play the speed of the ball and the speed and variety of the restarts are absolutely critical			2
i want to see quick , pre-called line - outs and the ball in and out of the scrum quickly to avoid the risk of giving penalties away at the back of it			0
if the line - out is n’t secure , there ’s nothing wrong with taking the tap penalty			0
keep the tempo up because this massive @entity38 side will not want to be moved around			0
@entity199 passes the ball and @entity0 must keep the ball in play as much as possible also , to score maximum points , you need the ball in play for the maximum amount of time			1
every time the ball ’s out of play , it is not only time but points ticking away			2
@entity0 must also employ an exciting restart policy			1
every kick - off must be done with the aim of getting the ball back			2
we need variety so we can kick left , right or down the middle but we must get it back			0
4 kick well , chase hard this is a huge test of @entity0 ’s tactical kicking game , which i ’m not sure is as good as it needs to be yet			1
in the 2003 @entity5 semi-final , i picked @entity227 at @entity228 ahead of @entity229 because he had a superior kicking game			2
@entity15 will believe they can get at @entity199 so @entity231 needs to support his kicking game			1
@entity231 needs to support @entity234 's kicking game and limit the up - and - unders i ’d limit the up - and - unders and box kicks , too , as they are too much of a lottery			2
@entity199 , @entity165 and @entity231 need to look deep and hit the green stuff			0
field position gave @entity241 the opportunity to get three drop goals as @entity0 won that semi 24 - 7 against a @entity38 team who were favourites to beat us			1
5 half - time the message needs to be that this is now a game of 40 minutes			2
you ca n’t change what ’s happened in the first half but you can learn			0
they ’ll know exactly what is needed and the team and tactics can change if needs be			0
the bench can then be used to identify areas of @entity38 weakness and attack them			0
@entity0 must make sure the second half is played as a game of 40 minutes understand , @entity15 are currently the best defensive team in the tournament , having only conceded two tries			1
patience will be a key word , but tries will come as long as we are playing the game at real pace			2
6 keep your best men on matches are won in the last 30 minutes , not the first 30 , and i ’d always look to have my strongest side on the field at the end of the game			2
the key is not to bring any player on unless he is going to improve the team			0
i still believe @entity283 can be a trump card			0
will @entity60 dare opt for a @entity234 - @entity283 - @entity63 combination if the game calls for it ? you can score two tries in the last five minutes ; it only takes 20 seconds to score			2
@entity283 can be @entity0 's trump card coming off the bench i ’d expect @entity0 to win — then it becomes about by how much			1
i just feel this @entity38 side is better than everyone is giving them credit for , and i ’m very surprised @entity60 has not picked a specialist second - row on the bench			0
it ’s a massive gamble as @entity299 and @entity300 have a history of injuries , potentially leaving @entity303 to play the majority of the match out of position in the second row			1
this is a hugely exciting day of rugby			0
people have questioned the staggered kick - off times but for me it makes the day unbelievably exciting and is brilliant for fans watching at home			0
it is a massive day for @entity316 and his team			0
they need this championship more than the others			0
they ca n’t afford another bad day at the office .			0

@entity0 play @entity15 in the final game of the @entity3 and will know exactly what they have to do to win the tournament
@entity0 must aim to win the @entity3 title and not just beat @entity15
@entity0 were in a similar position last year and failed to win the title
