by @entity0 published : 16:10 est , 6 july 2013 updated : 16:32 est , 6 july 2013 under threat : a classical country scene with a large @entity3 in the @entity4 near @entity5 the government is spending £ 1.1 million on an emergency project to save ancient @entity9 oaks from a mysterious disease that is causing the trees to ‘ bleed to death ’			1
thousands across the @entity13 have already been infected , with the disease so serious that oaks are being felled and their bark stripped and burnt to prevent it spreading			1
one theory is that a beetle may be responsible for the threat to the historic trees			1
researchers are now involved in a race against time to develop a way to stop the disease that , once it takes hold , kills the oaks within four years			1
the government has ordered a huge survey of trees across @entity13 to try to understand and track the new threat			1
many of @entity13 ’s ash trees are already doomed by the rapid spread of a fungal infection			1
scientists are also trying to isolate and identify a bacteria found on the dying oaks that was previously unknown and might be behind the infection			2
the three - year project is an effort to stem the spread of so - called ‘ acute oak decline ’ , or @entity45 , which is identified by dark weeping patches on stems of older trees			0
oaks more than 50 years old are at the greatest threat			1
researchers believe the disease may be linked to the oak jewel beetle because the diseased trees ’ bark is often pitted with the insects ’ distinctive d - shaped exit holes			1
the beetle ’s larvae have also been found in or near the ‘ bleeding ’ patches on the trunk of dying trees			0
it is not known if beetles are attracted to the scent of the infected trees or if they are carriers of the disease that is killing them			2
attack : the oak jewel beetle that feeds on oak timber using advanced sequencing technology , scientists will analyse the dna of bacteria , fungus and insects found on healthy and infected trees to isolate the cause			0
the @entity80 and bioscience experts at @entity82 and @entity84 universities are leading the project , which will take samples from up to 200 woodlands			0
estates belonging to the @entity89 are among the hardest hit			0
at @entity94 in @entity95 , the majority of the oaks within its 950 acres of historic parkland are suffering from the disease			2
ancient trees at @entity98 in @entity99 are also affected			1
according to a @entity80 document , estate workers should ‘ strip the outer bark and sapwood of heavily infected and dying or dead trees after felling and burn on site ’			0
‘ rapid destruction of stripped bark is recommended to prevent the possibility the disease spreading , ’ it adds			0
mysterious disease : thousands of oaks have already been affected , which kills them within four years dr @entity115 , from @entity116 , is carrying out dna research using forensic science techniques pioneered in medical research to try to identify the bacteria			1
he said : ‘ it is affecting older trees , some hundreds of years old , and whatever is behind it is causing the decline of something that has been here for so long , is much loved , and is difficult , if not impossible , to replace			2
‘ it is a very complicated issue			0
it could involve new bacteria that have been isolated from the lesions on the stems or the oak jewel beetle			0
we are looking at their involvement but both could be passive bystanders in the process			0
’ dr @entity137 , head of the @entity80 ’s @entity139 , said : ‘ we are determined to do everything possible to protect our trees			0
@entity45 is a complex condition and this new funding will enable us to better understand it , and the number and distribution of trees affected			2

thousands of oaks have already been affected by a mysterious disease
it can kill the ancient trees within four years
government has ordered a huge survey across @entity13 to track the threat
