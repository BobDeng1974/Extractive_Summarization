sea levels along the north - east coast of @entity2 rose almost four inches in just two years , a report has revealed			1
the record increase north of @entity5 between 2009 and 2010 is being described by experts as an ‘ unprecedented ’ one in 850 - year event			1
and in @entity10 , @entity11 , sea levels rose by five inches ( 12.7 cm ) over the same two year period , researchers found			1
sea levels along the north - east coast of @entity2 rose almost four inches in just two years , a report has revealed			1
pictured is @entity15 , located north - east of @entity5 the report , published in the journal @entity18 , warned that coastal areas would need to prepare for ‘ extreme ’ sea - level events			1
experts at the @entity22 and @entity23 studied data from tidal records along the east coast of both the @entity27 and @entity28			0
professor @entity29 of the @entity22 told the @entity30 : ‘ the extreme sea level rise event during 2009 - 10 along the northeast coast of @entity2 is unprecedented during the past century			1
‘ when coastal storms occur , extreme sea levels can lead to elevated storm surge			1
the record increase north of @entity5 ( pictured ) between 2009 and 2010 is being described by experts as an ‘ unprecedented ’ one in 850 - year event a graph shows yearly sea level rise along the northeast @entity2 coast in millimeters per year			1
the red bar shows how extreme the spike was in 2009			2
this spike lasted into 2010 ‘ in addition to long - term and gradual sea level rise , coastal communities will need to prepare for short and extreme sea level rise events			1
’ the researcher told the @entity49 that the sea level had dropped following the spike but that it was still ' much higher ' than when the spike started in 2009			1
he added that global warming ' definitely contributed to this event			0
' the website points to the unusually high tides that were widely reported in 2009 and 2010 from @entity56 ’s @entity55 to @entity28			2
the study ’s authors wrote that in terms of beach erosion , the 2009 - 2010 sea rise was ‘ almost as significant as some of the hurricane events ’			1
the quickest jump in sea levels took place between april 2009 and march 2010 , it says			1
one of the researchers , @entity69 , added : ' the sea level rise of 2009 - 2010 sticks out like a sore thumb for the @entity72			1
' researchers believe it was caused by a 30 per cent slowdown in a key ocean current system called the @entity77 ( @entity77 ) , as well as changes in atmospheric pressure at sea level , the @entity73 reported			2
the study used information gathered from a series of tide gauges along the east coast with the four inch rise taken from the average of 14 gauges between @entity28 and @entity5			2
the @entity89 could be completely free of ice in just 40 years as a result of global warming , one of the world 's leading climate change experts has warned			0
this would cause sea levels to rise to nearly unmanageable levels			2
@entity100 winner professor @entity99 said there is evidence that temperatures are rising four times faster in the frozen region than the rest of the planet			0
this means that there will only be open water in the polar region by the 2050s , with nothing more than a few floating icebergs at the @entity114 , according to the @entity116 academic			0
professor @entity99 , from the @entity118 in @entity119 , gave his stark warning during a lecture in the @entity122 - the coldest part of @entity116			0
he forecasts that the region will see temperature rises of up to 7 ° c within a century			0
‘ for several reasons , the @entity89 climate change is more intense and faster than in other regions			0
there is a reduction in snow and ice cover , which has a protective function , ’ he said			0
‘ on average over the last year , the minimum area of sea ice has decreased from 5.4 to 5.3 million square kilometres [ two million square miles ]			2
over the past 10 years , the reduction of sea ice in the @entity89 was by 13.7 per cent			0
as well as rising sea waters , such climate change could threaten delicate ecosystems and marine life			0
according to environmentalists , as the snow and ice melts , the ability of the @entity89 region to reflect heat back into space is reduced and the rate of global warming is accelerated once more			0
this could spark increasing numbers of forest fires and unpredictable storms and , at worst , bring a halt to the @entity157 which warms @entity158			0
sea levels rose four inches from @entity5 to @entity160 ( red dots ) in 2009 and 2010			1
gauges from @entity5 south to @entity55 ( pink dots ) showed a smaller spike for the same time period			2
no sea level spike was recorded on the gauges ( white dots ) south of @entity55 @entity169 gathered further south found that the rise in sea - levels were more in keeping with average figures			1
the @entity174 's dr @entity173 , told the @entity30 that the data showed the importance of analysing links between ocean currents and surges in sea levels			0
he said : ' @entity182 change is a complex phenomenon , especially on the regional scale , where changes to the global ocean circulation can play a major role			0
' the east coast of @entity2 is quite close to an area of active , fast ocean currents , and so is quite sensitive to changing ocean circulation			0
' the findings come a month after researchers at @entity194 found that the world 's sea levels had risen faster than expected in the last 20 years as a result of global warming and other factors .			2

@entity202 north of @entity5 rose by record levels between 2009 and 2010
levels were up by five inches over the same period at @entity10 , @entity11
researchers are calling the rise an ' unprecedented ' one in 850 - year event
they warn that coastal areas need to prepare for ' extreme ' sea - level rises
