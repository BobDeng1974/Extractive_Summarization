are you ready for one of the least likely fashion hits of summer ? earlier this week , @entity5 fashion chain @entity3 announced that it has been selling 40,000 kimonos a week , beating other summer trends printed trousers and maxi dresses into second and third place			1
@entity11 wearing a kimono in the @entity13 the @entity15 - influenced cover - up took off earlier this year as festival fashion , worn with fringing , cut - off denims and cowboy boots for a look that ’s more boho than @entity21			1
@entity21 was the period in @entity15 from 1615 when the art of kimono - making was at its height and wives of wealthy merchants entered fashion contests to outdo each other with dazzling designs			1
now they ’re everywhere from @entity32 to @entity33 and @entity34			2
i have a nostalgic affection for the kimono , and had a beautiful black ankle - length one ( left ) with red and gold embroidery i wore as a dressing gown in the @entity13 until it started to unravel			1
then there was the simple cotton version that i wore for several summers over flared jeans			2
but when @entity46 adopted the kimono as his signature style in the @entity49 , i decided their time was up			2
the kimono , far from just being festival fashion for @entity55 wannabes , has a lot to offer			2
bingo wings and lumps and bumps are instantly concealed			1
as a beach cover - up you can slip it over a swimsuit far more discreetly than a kaftan that needs to be pulled indecorously over your head			1
a short kimono is the perfect summer cardigan replacement and rather less old ladyish			1
and if you feel swamped by too much bulk , you can cinch your kimono with a belt			0
to find out if i can still cut it in a kimono at 62 , i put seven @entity5 styles to the test			1
it would certainly be useful as a dressing gown			0
score : 4/5 @entity90 , £ 40 , oasis - @entity91 @entity93 top , £ 95 , reiss.com jeans , £ 40 , topshop.com shoes , £ 95 , lkbennett.com my favourite			1
despite being closest in style to a traditional kimono , teamed with jeans and the silky top it looks casual , modern and — dare i say it — trendy			0
score : 5/5 floral kimono , £ 35.99 , and leather skirt , £ 119 , zara.com @entity105 , £ 29.50 , marksandspencer.com @entity107 , £ 69 , @entity106 , £ 45 , clarks.co.uk i 'd want less fringing , but this might make a twist on smart office wear			1
@entity113 , it adds a more feminine shape but shows you mean business			0
i ’d prefer a more subtle print — it ’s too close to curtains			0
score : 2/5 black kimono with embroidery , £ 35 , @entity120 , £ 175 , @entity107 , £ 49 , reiss.com i ’d wear this to a cocktail party			0
the embroidery at the back is beautiful and i can barely believe it costs just £ 35 , it ’s so elegant			0
but you need to dress it up with high strappy sandals and a waist - cinching belt to show what your figure looks like			2
score : 4/5 @entity134 kimono , £ 69 , houseoffraser.co.uk dress , £ 149 , hobbs.co.uk shoes , £ 160 , lkbennett.com i love the cheery colour combinations , but i ’ve ended up looking like a frump			0
i ’m not sure that kimonos should be worn over dresses			1
the overall effect is far too boxy			0
it looks like an oversized cardie			0
score : 2/5 maroon tasselled kimono , £ 27.99 , newlook.co.uk @entity105 , £ 95 , and trousers , £ 120 , reiss.com shoes , £ 185 , lucychoilondon.com a good colour to take you from summer through to autumn , but it looks and feels a bit cheap			1
i like the tassels and pattern , but it ’s see - through , so a carefully considered top underneath is important			2
i ’d probably save this one for evenings			0
score : 3/5 black - and - yellow , £ 45 , @entity156 , £ 40 , @entity157 , £ 9.99 , @entity158 , £ 55 , marksandspencer.com i ’m taking this lightweight kimono on holiday in september			2
i can team it with whites while warding off the chill			0
it ’s understated and flattering			0
