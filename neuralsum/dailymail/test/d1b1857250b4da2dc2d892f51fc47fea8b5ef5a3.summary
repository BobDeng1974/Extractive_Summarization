@entity7 boss @entity8 wants to win one visit from an @entity3 club at @entity0 this season however , a 2 - 0 success at @entity25 12 days ago could have marked a turning point for @entity7 in their previously flagging push for promotion			1

@entity53 scores the opening goal as @entity15 beat @entity7 at @entity0 back in august ‘ this game is n’t how people thought it would be at the beginning of the season and if you look at the consistency they ’ve shown then it is full credit to them			1
‘ they will have had all the plaudits and rightly so , but it ’s all about us on sunday and we have a long way to go this season			0
‘ we want to keep the momentum going and keep the belief in each other			0
it ’s about looking around the dressing room now and knowing you can trust your team - mates , knowing that he is going to go to the end for you and get that ball for you			0
‘ there if one thing every successful side needs and it is togetherness and a good work ethic – hopefully we are getting that and added to that is confidence and good quality players			0
‘ we are n’t getting carried away and i am sure there will be one or two ups and downs towards the end of the season			0

’ @entity96 celebrates after scoring against @entity3 club @entity20 at @entity25 @entity8 views @entity15 ’ 2 - 0 win over @entity7 at @entity17 in november – when @entity98 was sent off during the first half – as a pivotal moment in the season			1

‘ they have been playing at such a high level all season - their consistency levels , the amount of goals they ’ve scored and their fitness levels			0
