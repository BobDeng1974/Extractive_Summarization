@entity2 prices could fall by more than £ 30,000 if @entity3 breaks away from the @entity4 , it was claimed today			1
property website @entity5 suggested that a @entity8 vote in thursday 's referendum could cause as bad a shock to the markets as the financial crisis - while one estate agent predicted that ' every area of the market ' would be damaged			1
uncertainty over @entity3 's economic future and the potential loss of skilled jobs as businesses relocate to @entity22 would reduce demand for housing and depress prices , the company said			1
the comments came as @entity26 flew in to @entity3 in a final attempt to shore up support for the @entity29 with just three days to go before the vote			0
the average home in @entity3 currently costs £ 177,599 , having risen by 8.3 per cent in the past two years , according to @entity5			2
however , a vote for independence would usher in a period of uncertainty over @entity3 's future currency and tax rates , which could reduce market confidence and make it harder to get a mortgage			1
the website points out that house prices are driven by demand , meaning that if top businesses move jobs out of @entity3 there would be fewer workers looking to buy and prices would fall			1
financial firms such as the @entity62 and @entity63 have pledged to move to @entity22 in the event of a @entity8 vote , although it is not yet known how this will affect @entity3 - based employees			1
@entity5 said : ' if the economic impact on @entity3 is as severe as some recent market commentary has suggested , a @entity8 vote could potentially create a market shock on a par with the recent financial crisis when house prices in @entity3 fell by 17.5 per cent , which would wipe over £ 31,000 off the value of the average @entity3 home and £ 85billion off the value of the total housing stock in @entity3			1
' uncertainty is never good for markets			0
it is possible that after all the efforts to create a sustainable recovery a @entity8 vote could reverse the recent gains and dampen future house price growth for @entity3 homeowners			0
a no vote would remove uncertainty from the market and likely allow the recovery to continue			0
' support : but the value of financial assets could be seriously affected by a @entity8 vote spokesman @entity95 added : ' while the impact of the referendum on the @entity3 and wider @entity4 economy long - term is hard to predict and there are opposing views , a @entity8 vote would almost certainly have a detrimental effect on @entity3 house prices in the short to medium - term			2
' the uncertainties on employment , tax , currency , @entity111 membership and interest rates will all play their part and if big business does head south with a @entity8 vote , @entity3 will lose a significant piece of their service economy with nothing to replace it , leading to a greater supply and reduced demand for housing , and a resultant drop in house prices			1
' @entity125 , an @entity126 - based estate agent , said that @entity3 independence would do ' a lot of damage ' due to the uncertainty caused by the negotiations which would have to follow a @entity8 vote			1
he told @entity133 : ' markets do n't like uncertainty - if you do n't know which government you 've got coming , if you do n't know what currency you 're using			0
' mr @entity125 - who is currently working on £ 5million of deals which will collapse in the event of a @entity8 vote - predicted that the upper end of the property market would be the worst affected , but added : ' every area of the market is going to suffer			1
' the disruption could last for longer than the 18 months which the @entity3 government has set out as a timetable for independence , he claimed			2
many estate agents have declined to comment on the market 's prospects , but mr @entity125 said he had ' a moral obligation to speak out '			0
opposition : supporters of the @entity29 have repeatedly pointed out the dangers of independence @entity158 , the chief secretary to the treasury , said that house prices had been rising thanks to the @entity4 's economic recovery and the policies of the @entity163			0
' homeowners in @entity3 will be deeply worried by this news , ' he said			0
' millions of @entity3 have worked hard to own their home , and many more aspire to do so			0
' this is yet another example of how @entity33 's reckless drive to a separate @entity3 would hit our pockets and household budgets			0
' in a separate report , @entity173 said today that @entity3 independence would jeopardise house prices across the @entity4 due to the uncertainty about how @entity4 's assets would be divided			2
' even the very debate around @entity3 independence and possible implications for the economic outlook for the rest of the @entity4 could cause uncertainty in the minds of potential home - movers contemplating a large long - term financial commitment , ' an analyst said			2
the house price predictions are the latest bad news for @entity33 to emanate from the financial world , after a think - tank warned that the government of an independent @entity3 would face a £ 14billion black hole in its public finances			2
last week , @entity196 compared the prospect of independence to the @entity199 , while the governor of the @entity201 predicted that @entity3 would have to build up huge capital reserves , which would to a period of swingeing austerity .			0
