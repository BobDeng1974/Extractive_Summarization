@entity0 took a swipe at @entity2 as @entity3 prepared for their trip to the @entity5 , claiming @entity6 must take points and titles from clubs who fail to comply with @entity11			1
the @entity3 boss said it would be a fairer punishment than the fines and squad restrictions which @entity2 have faced this year			1
‘ everybody knows there are fines and , if these fines exist , control exists , ’ said @entity0 , in an interview with @entity18 broadcasters @entity17			2
‘ but are fines fair ? i do n’t think so			0
in my opinion the first thing is to remove points and remove titles			0
@entity0 claims clubs who fail to comply with @entity11 should be thrown out of the @entity29 @entity31 and @entity32 tackle @entity30 during @entity2 's defeat at @entity34 @entity3 have been unashamedly bankrolled by @entity36 billionaire @entity35 ‘ if you have important capital which allows you to overcome the @entity11 ; if you win titles and then you are fined economically , you keep doing the same thing			1
’ @entity0 added with a shrug : ‘ they will take from you one or two players from the @entity29 list			2
then , instead of 24 , you go with 22			0
but if you ’re stating that you will start the next @entity29 with six points fewer , or you wo n’t play in the next edition of the @entity29 and go into the @entity48 instead , it ’s more serious			0
’ @entity6 punished @entity2 , @entity49 and @entity50 this year for breaking @entity11 rules			1
@entity2 were fined £ 50million — though this will be reduced if they comply in future — and they had their squad for this year ’s @entity29 campaign cut to 21 players			2
after years of huge cash losses , @entity3 worked hard to comply with @entity11 and this week , chief executive @entity57 admitted the club had changed its policy from the days when they were unashamedly bankrolled by @entity35			1
@entity57 says they now have to ‘ chase the penny ’			0
