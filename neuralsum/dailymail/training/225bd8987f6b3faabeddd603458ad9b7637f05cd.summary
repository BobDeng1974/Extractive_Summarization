@entity1 's new government has discovered 50,000 ' ghost soldiers ' who received army salaries without showing up for work - a practice which accelerated the military 's collapse in the face of @entity9 fighters six months ago			1
the names , equivalent to almost four full army divisions , were uncovered in an investigation launched by prime minister @entity13 , who took office in september			1
' ghost soldiers ' were men on the army payroll who paid their officers a portion of their salaries and in return did not show up for duty - enriching their commanders and hollowing out the military force			1
' local officials in @entity42 said the city should have been defended from an @entity9 attack in june by 25,000 soldiers and police - but in reality the number was at best 10,000			2
@entity9 militants took control of the city with barely a fight			0
the @entity53 spent billions of dollars trying to build up @entity1 's armed forces before it pulled out of the country in 2011			1
it has since sent military advisers back to @entity1 to train them to take on the @entity9 fighters who now control much of the north and west of the country			1
investigation : new @entity1 prime minister @entity63 launched the inquiry which discovered 50,000 ' ghost soldiers ' @entity1 troops confirmed the existence of ' ghost soldiers to @entity69			1
' there are two kinds of ' fadhaiyin ' , ' one experienced officer in the security forces said , using a word which , literally translated , means ' space men ' , and refers to the fictitious soldiers crowding the payroll			2
' the first kind : each officer is allowed , for example , five guards			0
he 'll keep two , send three home and pocket their salary or an agreed percentage			0
' then the second and bigger group is at the brigade level			0
a brigade commander usually has 30 , 40 or more soldiers who stay at home or do n't exist			0
' the problem is that he too , to keep his job as a brigade commander , has to bribe his own hierarchical superiors with huge amounts of money			0
' the officer explained that , for those reasons , the thousands of soldiers who defected or were killed this year across @entity1 were rarely declared as such			2
dozens of military officials appointed during previous pm @entity103 's ( above ) eight - year rule have been sacked in the new leader 's pledge to root out corruption blame : local officials in @entity42 ( above ) said the city should have been defended from an @entity9 attack in june by 25,000 soldiers and police , but in reality the number was at best 10,000 since taking over as premier from @entity116 , @entity63 has sacked dozens of military officials appointed during @entity116 's eight - year rule and pledged to root out corruption			1
on monday , @entity13 's office announced he had retired 24 senior @entity122 officials and replaced them with new officers under a reform plan to make the security forces ' more effective in confronting terrorism '			2
finance minister @entity127 told @entity128 last week there was a need for deep - rooted reform of the security forces to fight what he called corruption and mismanagement			0
' the military has to be cleaned of all these numbers , figures of ghost soldiers and other mismanagement , ' he said			0
@entity13 's spokesman @entity29 added : ' @entity13 is setting integrity , efficiency and courage as the criteria to appoint a new military leadership			2
' this weeding out process will extend beyond the military to all state institutions			0
' the practice of not showing up for work has been blamed for the military 's collapse in the face of @entity9 fighters six months ago ( file picture )			1

thousands on the payroll bribed officers with a portion of their salary
in return they would n't show up for duty , seriously *weakening* @entity1 's forces

names of *culprits* uncovered in new pm 's *anti-corruption* investigation
practice has been blamed for major military defeats *including* fall of @entity42
