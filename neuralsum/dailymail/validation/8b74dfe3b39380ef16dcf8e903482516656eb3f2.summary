four patients have been infected with an antibiotic - resistant ' superbug ' linked to a type of medical scope that is used on more than a half - million people in the @entity5 every year			1
the incident took place at @entity8 in @entity9 where the patients were confirmed with the bacteria known as @entity12			1
the revelation comes two weeks after a similar outbreak happened at @entity15 where two patients died and seven were left ill after becoming infected with the bacteria			1
the incident took place at @entity8 ( above ) in @entity9 where the patients were confirmed with bacteria known as @entity12 @entity8 said that it halted endoscopic procedures after learning about the @entity28 outbreak and launched its own investigation			1
however , the germ may have been transmitted through a duodenoscope during procedures performed between last august and january			1
the hospital said there is no evidence other patients are at risk , but as a precaution , it sent free home - test kits to 64 patients who had procedures to diagnose pancreatic and bile - duct problems			1
@entity8 said that it halted endoscopic procedures after learning about the @entity28 outbreak and launched its own investigation			1
the germ may have been transmitted through a duodenoscope during procedures performed between last august and january ( above illustration of how a duodenum is used during procedures ) in recent years , hospitals across the country have grappled with cases of @entity12 , or carbapenem - resistant @entity54 , with some linked to hard - to - clean medical scopes made by @entity56 and other companies			1
the bacteria can cause infections of the bladder or lungs and can contribute to death in up to half of seriously infected patients			1
last month , two people died and 16 were hospitalized in @entity65 after contracting @entity12 at an unnamed hospital			0
the latest cases come two weeks after a similar outbreak happened at @entity15 ( above ) where two patients died and seven were left ill after becoming infected with the bacteria the latest infections were reported to state and local health departments and the @entity74			1

@entity12 , or @entity12 , are bacteria that are unique in that they are resistant to most antibiotics			0
they typically live in the soil or water			0
patients infected with the bacteria are typically not symptomatic , but can develop pneumonia , kidney and bladder infections , and bloodstream infections			2
they began appearing in the @entity5 roughly twelve years ago , and have since spread to at least 41 states			0
there is no effective treatment yet available for the bacteria , which can linger in the body more than a year , and mortality rates hover at 40 to 50 per cent			0
both have since implemented more stringent disinfection procedures , and @entity8 said it removed the contaminated scope from use and will resume endoscopic procedures after consulting with other hospitals and government agencies			2
in the @entity28 outbreak , the hospital offered free testing to about 170 patients who were potentially exposed , and the hospital said wednesday it does not have an update on the results			0
the @entity114 has said it received reports of 135 patients in the @entity5 who may have been infected by contaminated scopes between january 2013 and december 2014			2
on february 19 , it alerted hospitals with a safety warning that even with thorough cleaning , the risk of infection may persist , according to @entity123			0
the agency has acknowledged that the design of the scopes can make them hard to clean , but it said pulling them off the market would deprive patients of ' this beneficial and often life - saving procedure			0
' @entity56 of the @entity129 declined to comment on the @entity8 infections			0
it previously said it is working with the @entity114 on the infection problem and providing guidance to hospitals .			0
