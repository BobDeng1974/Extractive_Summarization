the @entity0 enjoyed their finest night in their international history while @entity5 football fell to its knees on friday			2
a 1 - 0 win in @entity8 is comfortably their greatest victory on the world stage , but the success in @entity13 piles on the misery for the home nation			1
already down and under fire after losing at home to @entity18 , @entity20 's 61st - minute goal could not have arrived at a more inopportune time			1
@entity0 ' @entity20 celebrates after scoring against @entity22 coach @entity23 will do well to survive such a ghastly result , while deep problems in the domestic league will add to the gloom with the @entity28 on friday suspending all professional football after an alleged off - the - field attack on a referee			1
while a @entity5 inquest will now kick - off , the @entity0 can celebrate a truly memorable win			2
this was just their 20th win since joining the international stage in 1988 and their first competitive one since 2011			0
their last competitive away win came in 2001 against @entity40			0
victories have come against the likes of @entity43 and @entity44 , though , and never against an established , top - level nation			0
while @entity22 may be falling , they were @entity47 champions 10 years ago and this win - brought about by former @entity49 academy player @entity20 - is a seismic one			1
@entity0 celebrate @entity52 's strike against @entity22 on friday night it was clear something unusual was in the offing as @entity22 laboured in the first half , where other sides would usually be scoring goals			1
they did not help themselves with a tepid opening , but even when they got about their opponents , they struggled to make hay			0
@entity66 had their first chance , heading wide from a corner , and then @entity70 drove over from inside the box			0
@entity72 forced a first save of the game out of @entity74 , but from distance , while @entity76 and @entity77 were both off target			0
@entity5 impotency invited the @entity0 on and two minutes before the break they went closer than anyone as @entity82 had a header clawed away by @entity84			2
former @entity85 boss @entity23 has lost three of his four games in charge of @entity22 their surprising pressure continued and @entity22 were happy to get in level at the break as @entity20 also forced a fine save out of the home keeper			1
buoyed by their chances , the @entity0 started the second half impressively			2
@entity82 took aim from just inside the area and was set to celebrate until the ball hit the post			0
@entity22 continued to be slack and @entity20 made @entity84 work again , and eventually the pressure told			1
on the hour @entity20 connected with a ball from 12 yards out and the deadlock was broken			2
@entity22 knew they were facing a real embarrassment and @entity66 set about trying to make amends , but hit over when well set			0
@entity66 thudded the bar too , but the @entity0 had earned their luck and their moment			0
@entity111 's reign as @entity113 coach looked to have ended after @entity115 leaders @entity116 romped to a 4 - 0 victory in their @entity119 qualifier in @entity120			1
@entity111 - who had spells in @entity122 with @entity49 and @entity123 as well as playing for @entity125 club @entity124 - declared he would resign no matter what the final outcome at the @entity128 , after just one win in their opening matches left @entity113 with little hope of qualification			1
@entity116 , though , remain very much on course for booking a place for the finals in @entity138 , having defeated @entity141 winners @entity139 in their last outing			0
the visitors made the breakthrough at the start of the second half , when @entity148 headed in from a corner , before two goals in as many minutes from @entity151 and @entity152 ended any hopes of a comeback			0
@entity155 added a fourth in stopage time , which appeared to back up the post-match claim of @entity111 , appointed to the job in november 2009 , that ' @entity113 football is dead '			2
after soaking up some pressure from the hosts , @entity116 were denied by the woodwork twice in quick succession			0
@entity116 's @entity151 ( right ) scores past @entity113 goalkeeper @entity167 first , on 17 minutes , @entity168 shot from the edge of the penalty area came back off the post , with the follow - up from @entity173 also hitting the upright - much to the relief of @entity113 goalkeeper @entity167			1
@entity113 fashioned a good opening on 26 minutes when a clever backheel by @entity177 after a thrown - in helped set up @entity179 for a sight of goal from just inside the box , but the @entity184 midfielder blazed over			2
@entity116 coninued their dominance in the second half			0
@entity188 acrobative effort was tipped away by @entity167 , before the visitors took the lead on 51 minutes			0
a corner from the left was nodded back by @entity151 and @entity148 headed it past @entity113 midfielder @entity193 on the line , who was afterwards booked for an attempted handball			0
@entity188 drilled the ball over , before @entity113 started to get a foothold back into the match as @entity193 dragged a 22 - yard effort just wide past diving @entity116 goalkeeper @entity201			1
@entity113 's @entity203 , and @entity116 's @entity155 fight for the ball during @entity119 qualifier @entity116 , though , doubled their lead with 20 minutes left			1
a deep free - kick from @entity208 was flicked on by @entity148 towards the far post , where @entity151 arrived to squeeze the ball past @entity167			0
it was soon 3 - 0 when @entity212 midfielder @entity211 curled in a superb 25 - yard effort after a sublime touch from @entity188 had killed the ball out on the right touchline			1
@entity116 were denied by the woodwork once again on 83 minutes when @entity218 's header bounced back off @entity116 forward @entity155 and struck the crossbar			2
the @entity220 forward , though , got on the scoresheet in stoppage time , when he swept the ball home after @entity188 's angled shot was blocked @entity227 's @entity226 celebrates his goal against @entity229 with @entity230 ( left ) @entity227 recovered from a goal down to beat @entity229 3 - 1 away thanks to @entity230 's double and a goal from defender @entity226 in their @entity234 i qualifier in an empty stadium on friday			1
@entity230 equalised on the hour and struck again in the 85th minute , with @entity226 having put them in front in the 62nd , after @entity241 gave the hosts the lead four minutes into the match			0
the game was played behind closed doors after @entity229 got a two - game crowd ban for fan violence in their last home qualifier against @entity251 , which was abandoned after a drone stunt triggered a player brawl and a pitch invasion by @entity229 fans			2
the result left @entity227 top on seven points from four games while @entity229 , who were awarded a 3 - 0 walkover win over the @entity262 but were also docked three points and have appealed the latter part of the verdict , have one point from two games			1
the defeat has piled the pressure on @entity229 's @entity271 coach @entity270 , who said he was considering quitting .			1

@entity20 was the hero for the @entity0 in @entity8
@entity22 coach @entity23 faces the sack after *humiliating* loss
@entity113 boss @entity111 could be axed after 4 - 0 defeat by @entity116
@entity230 scored twice in @entity227 's 3 - 1 victory in @entity229
