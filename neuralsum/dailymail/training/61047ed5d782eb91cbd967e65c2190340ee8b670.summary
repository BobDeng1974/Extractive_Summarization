by @entity0 in scenes that would n’t look out of place on the @entity4 , these dizzying fly - throughs reveal the vast expanse beyond our solar system			0
it might not be @entity9 , but the computer simulations provide an incredible insight into what it would be like to journey through all the known galaxies in our universe			2
using the @entity19 and @entity20 ( @entity21 ) catalogue , this video accurately plots the universe as we know it today , increasing the sizes of galaxies slightly so they can be viewed			1
the visualisations released by @entity33 are part of new research showing that galaxies in ‘ vast empty regions ’ of the @entity38 are ‘ aligned into delicate strings ’			1
called ' tendrils ' , these strings of matter may link together in an intricate pattern , according to research by the @entity45			2
the universe is full of vast collections of galaxies that are arranged into an intricate web of clusters and nodes connected by long strings			1
these huge , empty regions are called voids , and for years , astronomers have been trying to understand the small population of galaxies that inhabit them			1
using data from the @entity21 survey , dr @entity59 found that the small number of galaxies inside these voids are arranged in a way never seen before			0
‘ we found small strings composed of just a few galaxies penetrating into the voids , a completely new type of structure that we 've called “ tendrils ” , ’ said dr @entity59			1
the simulations are perhaps the closet you will get to experiencing warp drive on @entity9 's @entity4 a sparkling arrangement : here , a simulation of the cosmic web is pictured , showing clusters of galaxies and a void in the middle of the image , where dr @entity59 and team discovered tendrils of galaxies the universe is full of vast collections of galaxies that are arranged into an intricate web of clusters and nodes connected by long strings			1
this remarkably organised structure is often called the ' cosmic web ' , with busy intersections of galaxies surrounding vast spaces , void of anything visible to us on @entity101			0
to discover tendrils , the @entity21 team created the largest ever galaxy census of the southern skies using observations from the @entity107 in @entity108 , @entity109			0
‘ our new catalogue has looked deeper into space and mapped each patch of sky up to ten times to make sure it 's as thorough as possible , ’ said dr @entity110 from the @entity45 node of @entity112			2
‘ we were n't sure what we 'd find when we looked at voids in detail , but it was amazing to find so many of these tendrils lurking in regions that have previously been classified as empty , ’ said dr @entity110			2
the @entity21 team plan to catalogue more tendrils for further study as their detailed map of the universe expands			0
computer simulations suggest that matter in the universe is distributed in a ' cosmic web ' of filaments , as seen in the image above from a large - scale dark - matter simulation			0
the inset is a zoomed - in , high - resolution image of a smaller part of the cosmic web , 10 million light - years across			0
