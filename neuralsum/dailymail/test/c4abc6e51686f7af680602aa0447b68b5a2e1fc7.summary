@entity0 has created a so - called ' green ' diesel fuel made using a combination of water and carbon dioxide			1
the car manufacturer described its breakthrough as the ' fuel of the future ' and claims it could provide a carbon neutral way of powering vehicles			1
experts used renewable energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into a form of crude oil known as ' blue crude ' , which was then refined into diesel			1
experts used renewable energy to convert the carbon dioxide and water into a form of crude oil known as ' blue crude ' , which was then refined into diesel tests have shown it can be mixed with diesel from fossil fuels , or used as a fuel in its own right			1
@entity0 has already begun using the new e-diesel to power the official car of @entity35 minister of education and research dr @entity36			1
@entity37 , head of sustainable product development at @entity0 , said : ' in developing @entity0 e-diesel we are promoting another fuel based on carbon dioxide that will allow long ‑ distance mobility with virtually no impact on the climate			1
@entity0 's fuel was developed with @entity47 , a @entity48 - based energy technology company			2
to make the fuel , water is first heated to form steam which is then broken down into its constituent hydrogen and oxygen using high - temperature electrolysis			0
by performing this process at temperatures above 800 ° @entity57 ) , the water breaks down with greater efficiency than at room temperature			0
the hydrogen is then pumped into a reactor with carbon dioxide at high pressure and high temperatures			2
this causes them to react to produce long - chained liquid hydrocarbons			0
hydrocarbons are the basic building block of all fossil fuels , but the compounds produced in the reactor are known as ' blue crude '			2
@entity0 claims the whole process can be powered using renewable energy and can be achieved with an efficiency of around 70 %			1
the blue crude can then be refined in a similar way to standard crude oil to produce e-diesel			1
' using carbon dioxide as a raw material represents an opportunity not just for the automotive industry in @entity35 , but also to transfer the principle to other sectors and countries			1
' the new fuel was developed by @entity0 along with @entity88 , a @entity48 - based energy technology company			0

@entity125 is pumped into a reactor with carbon dioxide at high pressure and high temperatures and causes them to react to produce liquid hydrocarbons , known as ' blue crude '			1
hydrocarbons form the base of fossil fuels @entity0 added that the synthetic fuel does not contain sulphur or hydrocarbon rings – known as aromatic hydrocarbons – which are found in crude oil and can create additional pollution			1
a breakthrough was recently made in the development of clean hydrogen power			0
currently , while hydrogen fuel is appealing , the production of hydrogen is incredible difficult - requiring huge amounts of energy			0
but the researchers say they have made a new material that can generate hydrogen from water , meaning it is less reliant on fossil fuels			0
researchers at the @entity155 and @entity156 have designed a molecular catalyst to split water in an electrolyser and create clean and storable hydrogen fuel			0
the approach increases the efficiency of electrolysis of water into its constituent parts by reducing the amount of energy needed to perform the oxidation half of the reaction			0
@entity168 , chief technology officer at @entity47 , said the fuel was highly combustible and produced less pollution than traditional diesel			0
he said : ' the engine runs quieter and fewer pollutants are being created			1
' a special processing plant has been built in @entity175 and is set to produce 3,000 litres of e-diesel in the coming months			0
the carbon dioxide is currently supplied by a biogas facility as a byproduct			2
@entity0 said it also extracts carbon dioxide from the ambient air using ' direct air capturing '			1
burning of fossil fuels is the main source of carbon dioxide emissions by humans into the atmosphere and is driving global warming			2
by capturing emissions from power plants and removing it from the air , @entity0 says its new fuel can be used without adding to the burden of gas in the atmosphere			1
the project is the latest attempt by @entity0 to produce more environmentally friendly fuels for its vehicles			0
@entity0 has already begun using the new e-diesel to power the official car of @entity35 minister of education and research dr @entity36			1
the minister is pictured testing the new fuel in her official car in 2009 it announced a project to produce e-gas - a form of synthetic methane – for use in its g - tron gas powered vehicles			0
at the launch of the new e-diesel , dr @entity36 put five litres of the fuel into her official @entity217			0
she said : ' this synthetic diesel , made using carbon dioxide , is a huge success for our sustainability research			2
' if we can make widespread use of carbon dioxide as a raw material , we will make a crucial contribution to climate protection and the efficient use of resources , and put the fundamentals of the " green economy " in place			2

@entity35 car manufacturer used renewable energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into ' blue crude ' oil which was then refined into diesel
the carbon dioxide can be removed from the air or from power plants
@entity0 claims its e-diesel is carbon neutral without adding to climate change
tests *suggest* it allows cars to run quieter and produce fewer pollutants
