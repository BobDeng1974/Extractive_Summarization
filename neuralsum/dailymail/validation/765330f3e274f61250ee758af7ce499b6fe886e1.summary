@entity0 may never have been here today			1
not the team harboring the awesome power of @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 up front			2
not the club who have won four @entity10 cups and so many domestic trophies they require a small cave rather than a mere cabinet to hold them			1
@entity16 @entity15 ' @entity14 is credited with rescuing @entity0 from extinction the awesome trio of @entity4 , @entity3 and @entity5 may not have been assembled if not for @entity14 not @entity20 's side who are aiming to knock @entity22 out of the last 16 of the @entity23			1
all of that is unlikely to have existed were it not for @entity16 @entity15 ' @entity14 , who as a player captained the red side of @entity28 during five years at @entity29 from 1914 but has inadvertently played a crucial role in setting up @entity22 's two - legged fixture with @entity0 a century later			1
@entity14 is credited with rescuing @entity0 from extinction during his time in charge between 1935 and 1940			1
@entity0 have enjoyed great success in recent years but it was @entity14 that saved the club in @entity38 , he became known as ' @entity39 ' - a title reserved for royalty or noblemen - for his successes after moving over aged 35 and first leading @entity44 to five regional titles before becoming one of the founding members of @entity48			1
he took charge at @entity50 and then won the @entity38 title at @entity52 , but his greatest legacy was shaped when @entity0 came calling			1
after just one season at the @entity57 club , the @entity54 broke out in july 1936 and the country was in chaos			1
@entity14 ( back row , far right ) pictured for @entity61 against @entity62 in 1914/1915 on the streets of @entity0 , anarchy was escalating			1
as the tanks rolled in , football was flattened in the country			2
@entity48 was suspended and , despite playing in and winning the @entity68 , cash was running out fast			1
the club were facing financial ruin			1
@entity14 orchestrated himself and the players taking a huge wage cut - reducing his salary by a third from $ 1,500 to $ 1,000 - but @entity0 were still heading out of business , until the wily @entity16 had a bright idea			1
@entity0 celebrate with the @entity23 trophy following victory over @entity29 in 2009 former @entity0 captain and defender @entity79 holds the @entity23 trophy in @entity82 he took the team on a tour of @entity85 and @entity86 , playing 14 games and raising $ 5,000 - the equivalent of $ 83,000 today			1
it was little , but enough to survive			2
by the time the war ended in april 1939 , @entity14 had dragged the team back from the brink of oblivion			2
why then would this @entity0 legend come to die alone and penniless in @entity94 20 years later ? while @entity14 is remembered so fondly in those sunnier climes , on our own shores an entirely different character is recalled by those he should have loved dearest			1
' he was the hero in one way but also the swine who left his family in poverty , ' his grandson @entity100 remembered			2
' there are two sides to it , a sad family story , but i 'm proud he was my grandfather			2
' @entity14 ( back row , one from the left ) as part of the @entity115 team in 1913 - 14 @entity14 was a gambler and a misogynist ; a chancer , swindler and trickster			0
he played for @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity115 before impressing @entity29 enough for them to pay Â£ 1,000 for his services in may 1914			0
the same year he captained @entity61 to the @entity124 , playing the final game against @entity126 with a broken arm			0
@entity14 was a brash , brazen , no - nonsense centre - back and was made captain of @entity29 straight away			0
however , the first season was a catastrophe and they avoided relegation from @entity134 by a single point			0
even worse - a victory against @entity137 in april was deemed fixed			0
@entity79 holds up the @entity139 trophy after victory against @entity141 at the tournament in @entity143 @entity145 and @entity144 photographed in ' cricketing ' pose at @entity147 in 1911 the @entity148 had broken out and no football was to be played the following season			0
a group of @entity29 and @entity137 players , fearing unemployment and what the future held , met in a pub the day before the game and agreed to the more unlikely 2 - 0 @entity29 win and bet on it at odds of seven - to - one			0
the scam was uncovered when the @entity162 investigated claims of a lack of effort from @entity137 players			0
@entity29 's @entity145 , @entity170 , @entity171 , and @entity137 's @entity172 , @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 were banned indefinitely by the @entity162			0
former @entity0 man @entity173 holds the @entity174 after beating @entity175 at @entity176 @entity168 was banned after rigging a game to win money when @entity137 faced @entity29 @entity137 's @entity169 was one of those players banned indefinitely by the @entity162 @entity137 's @entity172 was also banned for his part in the corrupt game between the rival teams @entity14 struck a penalty well wide with the score at 2 - 0 , but somehow avoided punishment			1
yet @entity14 's family admit that maverick streak ran through him			0
it was these scrapes and scraps which shaped an eventual legend			0
' he was an incredible success as a footballer but as a man he was probably a bit of loveable rogue , ' @entity100 's wife @entity192 explained			0
' as a father he was a non-starter			0
' he remained a @entity29 player through the war and after it ended had a year at @entity203 before moving to @entity204 in 1920			0
@entity205 is one of 40 players who have supported a fund to raise money for a fitting memorial @entity14 was determined to find success in football and would let nothing stand in his way			2
he left his wife @entity215 at @entity217 station in 1920 after she had travelled there to plead with him to return home			0
it was the last time @entity14 would see her and he married again in @entity38 , another @entity219 called @entity215			1
at @entity204 , he was made player - manager and had his first taste in running a club , before the sniff of adventure took him abroad			2
@entity226 has also supported the plea to get @entity14 a more fitting memorial following his death but for all his heroics in @entity38 , when @entity14 returned to @entity230 in 1958 he faded into destitution before he died in @entity94 a year later where he remains in an unmarked grave			1
last year , a fund was set up to raise money for a more fitting memorial			2
so far , more than 40 notable football names have supported it , including sir @entity239 , @entity226 , @entity240 , @entity241 and @entity205			0
there is a bust of @entity14 in the @entity244			0
there , he will always be remembered as the man who saved the club			1
@entity248 legend @entity241 is one of more than 40 players to support the memorial idea			0
