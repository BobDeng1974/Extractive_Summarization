their preparations for the @entity2 have been meticulously planned by a dedicated team of sports scientists , physiotherapists and nutritionists			1
it is therefore something of a surprise that @entity11 's footballers were allowed to enjoy a feast of burgers the night after they returned to @entity14 after losing their opening game			1
@entity17 sports presenter @entity16 revealed that @entity19 's men dined at a restaurant famous for serving some of @entity14 's best fast food , including a mammoth 10oz ' @entity22 '			1
@entity17 presenter @entity16 talks to former @entity11 player @entity23 before saturday 's match in @entity25 in the process they denied her the chance to sample the @entity30 beef patties for herself because they had booked out the whole place			1
the @entity33 said the @entity11 players ' nutritionists gave them special permission to have the treat at the @entity39 bar in the five - star @entity41 hotel , where they are staying in @entity14			1
perhaps of more concern is that a month ago a @entity45 consumer group said it had found food well past its expiry date in the hotel			2
restaurant reviews reveal that the burger restaurant has in the past been a favourite with players from @entity45 teams @entity53 and @entity54 , and stays open until 1am every day			1

@entity63 , 41 , who is also staying in the @entity41 , wrote on her blog of how the ' @entity66 ' scuppered her dinner plans on monday night			0
@entity11 players were given special permission to have the treat at the @entity39 bar in the five - star @entity41 hotel , where they are staying in @entity14 @entity11 's @entity72 and @entity73 leave the team hotel , the @entity41 at @entity75 , for training @entity63 , 41 , is staying in the @entity41 where @entity11 are based in @entity45 she said : ' with filming wrapped i suggested to my producer we should try the hotel burger bar , they looked amazing when i saw @entity84 eating them last week and we have n't succumbed yet			1
' you know when you have built up a food in your head all day and you want it so much you can taste it , it is the human equivalent to our @entity92 watching a @entity93 being carved			2
' but sadly for the salivating presenter , her hopes of tucking into one of the @entity41 's celebrated burgers were dashed			1
she wrote : ' as we approached the burger bar , i saw a sign saying ' private event – closed ”			2
my heart sank , my stomach flipped			0
then i peered in to see who was eating my burger , it was @entity11			2
' so as @entity108 , @entity109 and the rest devoured the best @entity30 beef , i had a bowl of chicken soup in the restaurant next door , not that i begrudge them at all			2
there 's always tomorrow …			0
' a source close to the @entity11 team told the @entity120 : ' @entity121 really missed a trick – yes , we were enjoying our burgers but she could have ordered one from the adjoining hotel restaurant			1
she should have read the menu			0
' an @entity33 spokesman added : ' the team were given a special treat which was cleared by the nutritionists			1
' they have been together for more than a month now and they have burnt off thousands of calories so having a burger was not deemed to be harmful in any way			0
' several of @entity11 's rivals have also been allowed a few comfort foods between their matches in @entity45			0
prior to the tournament it was revealed that the @entity144 @entity33 's chef had packed parmesan , lots of olive oil and prosciutto ham			1
@entity149 brought oatmeal , @entity151 , peanut butter and @entity153 to the @entity2 party , while the @entity156 squad naturally required a little more spice and travelled with chilli peppers , chipotle chillies and cacti			0
meanwhile , @entity11 's star striker @entity73 posted a candid selfie on @entity163 to vent his frustration when his hotel room tv stopped working			0
the 24 - year - old @entity167 forward was unwinding after training on monday night by watching an @entity169 basketball game			0
but when the tv set started playing up , he uploaded an angry photograph of himself lying on his bed wearing his white @entity11 t - shirt and a second picture of the blank screen			0
@entity73 , who scored @entity11 's only goal in the opening match against @entity178 , wrote : ' just when i start getting into the game and it 's going off my tv starts acting up ... i 'm fuming right now ! ! ! ' @entity45 2014 is the first true ' selfie @entity2 ' , with many players using @entity163 and other social networks to share their personal experiences of the tournament			1
more than 10,000 people have retweeted or favourited a picture posted by @entity73 of the @entity11 team travelling on their coach the day before the @entity191 game			0
it is not just the footballers who have succumbed to the current fad for sharing photographs of oneself online			0
@entity198 president @entity197 took a break from dealing with the jihadist onslaught in neighbouring @entity201 to watch his country 's 0 - 0 draw against @entity205 on monday night			1
to illustrate his support for @entity198 's players , he tweeted an incongruous picture of himself relaxing in front of his tv , having swapped his normal black clerical robe and white turban for an @entity198 football shirt and tracksuit trousers			2
in language far removed from the bombastic @entity217 rhetoric of some of his predecessors , mr @entity197 wrote : ' proud of our boys who secured our first point - hopefully the first of many more to come			0
' @entity224 chancellor @entity223 grinned in a selfie with @entity224 and @entity227 striker @entity226 while celebrating her country 's 4 - 0 victory over @entity230 on monday			2
