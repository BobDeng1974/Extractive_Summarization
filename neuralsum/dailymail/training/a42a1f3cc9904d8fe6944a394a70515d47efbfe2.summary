they are one of the most recognised symbols of the festive season , emulated in nativity plays all over the world and whose imagery adorns the front of millions of @entity8 cards			2
however the three wise men who presented the newborn baby @entity10 with gold , frankincense and myrrh could have been larger in numbers if a new interpretation of an ancient document is correct			2
an eighth - century script has been translated into @entity18 for the first time and throws an incredible new light on the @entity8 story			1
nativity scene : the imagery of the three wise men has been recreated on @entity8 cards all over the world the translation of the mysterious ' @entity26 ' describes how the three wise men actually numbered over a dozen and came from a faraway land , possibly @entity29			1
the @entity30 was the term , used from at least the fourth century @entity32 , for ancient stargazers who were able to read and manipulate the fate foretold in the skies			1
the script also reveals how it was @entity10 himself who was the famous star followed by the @entity30			1
@entity39 , a professor of @entity40 at the @entity41 , spent two years translating the eighth - century text from its original @entity43			1
the document has been held in the @entity45 for 250 years and the story is thought to have been first told in the late second , or early third , century			2
this takes it back to possibly just 100 years after @entity50 wrote his gospel - the only one to include the story of the @entity30			1
@entity50 never mentions how many the @entity30 numbered ; they are described as three wise men simply because there were three gifts			1
you might need a bigger cast : the latest revelation could change the face of nativity school plays across the world ( file photo ) there could have been several scores of them , according to the new translation			0
the authors of the document claim it was penned by the @entity30			1
however experts do not believe this to be the case and say it could have been written by their descendents , as it carries detailed accounts of their prayers and rituals			0
professor @entity39 thinks the sect that wrote it identified with the mystics			0
the story tells how the @entity30 were descended from @entity85 ’s third and righteous son , @entity84			1
it says they came from a semi-mythical place called @entity89 , which is on the eastern edge of the world - where modern - day @entity29 is			1
prof @entity39 said : ' the story says that @entity84 passed down a prophecy that at some point a star would appear that would signal the birth of @entity98 in human form			0
' @entity30 waited thousands of years , passing down the prophecy and then the star appeared where the @entity30 were			1
' it transformed into a small luminous human being who was @entity10 himself in a pre-existent , celestial form			0
new light : the document has been held in the @entity45 ( pictured ) for 250 years and the story is thought to have been first told in the late second or early third century ' it is saying that @entity10 and the @entity110 are the same thing and @entity10 can transform himself into anything			2
' @entity113 guides them to @entity115 and into a cave where it transforms into a human infant who tells them to go back and be preachers of the @entity50			0
' later the @entity121 turns up and baptises the @entity30 and tells them to go into the world			1
2nd/3rd century : original story written 8th century : current manuscript produced - for a millennium , it is unclear where the text was - 18th century : a collector finds the manuscript - written on a parchment made from animal skin - in a @entity133 monastery it was given it to the @entity45 library and archived away into obscurity 1927 : the @entity45 publishes the text into @entity43 ( a dialect of @entity140 used by @entity141 ) but it is again overlooked and forgotten 2000s : @entity142 scholar @entity39 finds the document and spends seven years translating the text from @entity43 to @entity18 ' the story does say that the @entity30 brought gifts to @entity10 , but interestingly the text never tells us if they are the familiar gold , frankincense , and myrrh			1
' prof @entity39 said it is unknown who wrote the text but added : ' somebody was really fascinated by the wise men to have created this big , long story and tell it from their perspective			0
' @entity159 is part of the @entity161 and was written in the syriac language that was spoken by @entity163 from @entity164 through @entity165 and @entity166			0
' there might have been a community who were using the @entity30 or its persona to get its religious perspective across			1
' there are many details of strange rituals , praying and silence			0
there is a description of a sacred mountain and purification at a sacred spring			0
' the detail is so great i wondered if it was the community ’s actual practices that were being described			0
' there is much in the @entity26 which is not self evident why it is there			0
' nobody knows where @entity50 got the story from so along with @entity50 this is as close as you can get to the @entity30			2
' in terms of the text itself , very little is known about its origins			0
it is unclear who wrote it or when , though academics think it is an 8th century manuscript written from a story from the second or third century			2
after , it is unsure where the text was for a millennium until a collector stumbled across it in a @entity133 monastery in the eighteenth century			2
the collector then transferred the document , written on @entity215 , a type of parchment made from animal skin , to the @entity45			0
it was then lost , archived away in @entity43 until a @entity142 student , @entity39 , spent almost a decade translating the text .			0

eighth - century script claims the ancient ' @entity30 ' stargazers came from ' as far away as @entity29 '
