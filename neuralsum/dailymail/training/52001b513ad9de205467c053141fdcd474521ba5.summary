yet it is nothing compared to @entity1 which weighed in at a astonishing 3lbs 11ozs in 1997 , making it a @entity3 world beater by @entity5 reporter a supermarket in @entity7 is selling a giant apple for £ 664 in @entity9 , capital of eastern @entity7 's @entity10			1
according to supermarket staff , the apple weighs 2.65lb and is from @entity13			2
the freak apple also has a @entity16 picture on the front			1
this was formed by wrapping the growing apple in a bag with a @entity16 picture on and over time sunlight caused the image to transfer onto the apple			1
yet it would appear that there are n't many takers for the whopper as this particular specimen has apparently been on sale for the past two months			2
@entity31 : the giant apple has a @entity34 picture imprinted on the front of it no takers : despite its enormous size and splendour there have been no takers for this beauty grown in @entity13 but according to expert @entity46 , head of fruit , vegetables and herbs at @entity50 , @entity51 , the apple 's size is insignificant compared to the biggest one ever recorded			1
the @entity52 weighed in at a astonishing 3lbs 11ozs in 1997 , making it a @entity3 world beater			1
it was grown by @entity56 farmer @entity55 who said he grew the apple on a 17 year old tree and that he first noticed it when it became the size of a ten pin bowling ball			2
@entity46 added that apples can be grown to these huge sizes naturally and that they are not necessarily genetically modified			0
big boy : compared to the other apples on the shelf it is far superior but coming in at a cost of £ 664 means nobody has taken it home with them overgrown : the apple looks more like a pumpkin or a marrow and has become a source of much amusement for the local shoppers and despite being worth £ 664 , the mammoth @entity13 grown apple also pales in comparison to some of the world 's other most expensive fruits			1
two years ago in @entity84 a pineapple was valued at a purse - busting £ 10,000 – making it the world ’s most expensive piece of fruit - and quite a price for something which has spent most of its life under several tons of horse manure			2
the pineapple was nurtured over two years using traditional @entity95 gardening techniques at the @entity96 of @entity97 , the botanical attraction in @entity84			0
horticulturalists created tropical conditions in small greenhouses heated using a chemical reaction between 30 tons of horse manure and urine , and piles of straw			0
a gardener who works at the @entity108 said the pineapple cost around £ 1,200 to grow			0
but even this was pipped in june 2013 when a @entity13 buyer spent £ 10,300 on two melons			0
the record - breaking @entity113 , or canteloupe , melons were sold during an auction at @entity117 in northern @entity13 where they are considered a status symbol			0
expensive : @entity121 , or @entity113 , melons like these ones are a status symbol in @entity13			0

the apple has caused quite a stir amongst @entity7 shoppers left amazed by its size and imprint of @entity16
but no one will buy it given it costs £ 664 and is more than two months old
coming in at a 2.65lb it is probably one of the largest apples in the world at the moment
yet it is nothing compared to @entity1 which weighed in at a astonishing 3lbs 11ozs in 1997 , making it a @entity3 world beater
