' they are now looking at delaying the training announced by @entity26			0
’ the @entity30 was unable to provide any timescale as to when the hundreds of soldiers would be deployed to the battlefield			1
it is understood a decision to consider delaying the plans came following a @entity60 report into deaths of serving personnel in @entity5			2
a source added : ‘ the conservative ’s concern about @entity5 and the potential for soldiers being killed has been reinforced by the @entity60 report which was raised at a recent meeting			2
’ original claim : @entity26 ( pictured ) , the defence secretary , announced in december that hundreds of @entity1 troops would be sent to @entity5 in january in a dramatic escalation of the war on terror the @entity60 @entity75 announced late last year that @entity77 corporal @entity76 had died while taking part in @entity79 – the codename given to the military campaign against @entity4			1

casualties : @entity76 corporal @entity76 ( left ) died while taking part in @entity79			0

soldiers were set to teach the @entity5 army vital skills , such as how to counter deadly roadside bombs , in a mission which was likely to lead to claims of ‘ mission creep ’			2
he announced : ‘ our role now , apart from the air strikes , is increasingly going to be on training			0
‘ particularly , a key skill we are going to be helping with its counter-ied , particularly vehicle explosive devices which the @entity5 army has n’t come across for some time , they do n’t know how to handle , they have n’t got the kit or the bomb disposal people to deal with it			0
‘ so the training we are going to be offering in january will be in infantry skills and some of the basics but particularly on how you deal with @entity146 , given all the lessons we have learnt from @entity148			0
’ a handful of @entity1 trainers have already been deployed to @entity5 to work with the @entity24 and @entity5 security forces			1
but the move signified @entity1 ’s commitment to a ‘ large - scale venture ’ in which @entity60 - led training programmes are set to be rolled out to soldiers fighting against militants taking over swathes of the country			0

it is understood they were to include soldiers from the 2nd battalion @entity170 , who would protect the training teams			0
@entity110 jihadists have started laying ieds to take out @entity5 forces as part of a change in tactics after @entity1 airstrikes blasted their vehicles and killed their fighters			1
@entity1 soldiers – who have learnt how to detect the deadly bombs after fighting against the @entity184 in @entity148 – were asked to help by the @entity5 government due to their specialist knowledge			1
the announcement by mr @entity26 came after the @entity1 and other allies agreed to support the initiative , which will be spearheaded by 3,500 @entity60 troops			2
the @entity60 - led @entity191 was set to include 1,500 troops from @entity1 , @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195 who would train @entity24 and @entity5 troops at the bases in @entity96 and @entity25			1
