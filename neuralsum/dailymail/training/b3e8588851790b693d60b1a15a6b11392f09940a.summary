by @entity0 published : 05:23 est , 5 november 2012 updated : 02:25 est , 8 november 2012 parents and pupils are furious after a religious studies gcse textbook was discovered to be littered with errors - including a caption that identifies a picture of a @entity7 as a jew			1
staff at @entity10 ( formerly known as @entity10 ) in @entity11 , @entity12 , have had to issue a four - page list of corrections to the 300 pupils using the book to prepare for their exam			1
the @entity18 : @entity19 , produced for the exam board by educational publishers @entity21 , has been branded ' offensive ' and ' laughably bad '			1
hard to study : the textbook , left , has been slammed for being ' confused ' and misleading ' for pupils			2
right , a picture from the textbook of a kneeling @entity7 labelled as a @entity8 it not only includes a picture of a @entity7 kneeling in prayer described as a @entity8 - who do not kneel to pray - but also shows a picture of a family ' celebrating @entity33 ' , when in fact they are having a @entity37 meal			1
@entity33 , or @entity33 , is a weekly day of rest and spiritual enrichment and the most important ritual observance in @entity19 , while the @entity37 is a @entity8 ritual feast that marks the beginning of the @entity8 holiday , conducted on one or two evenings in march or april , on the 14th and 15th day of @entity44 in the hebrew calendar			2
the blunders are especially embarrassing for @entity18 after it was accused of ' justifying ' anti-semitism in schools in may of this year , when one of its exam papers asked @entity54 pupils to explain ' why some people are prejudiced against @entity8 '			1
one pupil said : ' it was so bad , the teacher kept telling us , " do n't listen to this , ignore this , half of this is wrong "			2
' the mother of a @entity10 pupil told the @entity66 : ' the textbook contains countless errors and general , confused assertions about @entity19			0
the factual errors are laughably bad			0
@entity71 : the textbook says that this family is celebrating @entity33 , when in fact they are having their @entity37 meal ' a section headed " @entity19 " in fact talks about the practice of @entity80			0
a picture of a person kneeling in prayer , described as a jew , is in fact a @entity7			1
' other assertions in the text , including commentaries on women who wear wigs , and why @entity8 think they do what they do , are misleading and offensive '			0
@entity18 has become infamous for errors in its exam questions and marking			1
it is a concern for pupils battling to get the best grades possible in @entity98 and a-level exams : ( 2010 ) ( 2011 ) ( 2012 ) she claimed that @entity10 had to contact @entity18 to confirm that if students used the correct information about @entity19 it would not be marked incorrect by examiners because it did not tally with the information in the textbook			1
religious studies gcse is a compulsory exam at many schools and a new textbook is now in production			0
a spokesperson for @entity18 said : ' @entity18 does n't publish textbooks			0
we do liaise with publishers to try to ensure references to our syllabus are accurate ; however the publisher is responsible for the content of the book and , therefore , any errors			0
' @entity10 brought the errors to our attention and we raised them with the publisher			0
this book is being reprinted by the publisher and we have asked them to address these concerns			0
' the reprinted book will no longer carry the confirmation that it covers our syllabus , because of the serious level of concern we have flagged to the publishers about their errors			0
' the school 's headteacher , @entity133 , said he had worked closely with @entity18 over the past year and was pleased there would be a new draft of the textbook			1
@entity138 , the head of @entity8 studies at @entity142 's @entity141 , confirmed that he had co-written the textbook , but declined to comment further			2
this is not the first time @entity18 has come under fire for its association with mistakes that could affect pupils ' exam grades			1
in the summer of 2010 , 13 a-level students missed out on university places after marking errors by the exam board left them with lower grades than they should have received			1
the errors occurred when a failure with @entity18 's online system meant that not all of students ' material was marked , an inquiry found			0
the awarding body was criticised for not piloting its system properly , and for a delay in reporting the problem to exam regulators - meaning students were got given the university places they deserved			0
in june 2011 , thousands of pupils sat an @entity171 test in which two - thirds of the questions were identical to ones they had answered in a paper just three months earlier			2
this year , there were complaints over an ' unfair ' @entity98 , after pupils who took the exam in january found it easier to gain c grades than those who sat it in the summer .			2

exam board - *approved* textbook gets key facts about religion wrong
it shows a picture of a @entity7 praying - and claims it is actually a @entity8
teachers forced to tell pupils : ' ignore this book '
@entity18 was accused of ' justifying ' anti-semitism in may of this year , when one of its @entity54 exam papers asked why people are prejudiced against @entity8
it has also made previous blunders with exam questions and marking
