as the classic @entity3 invention of the cask wine turns 50 this year , the best goon bags on offer are revealed			1
many of us associate drinking from a shiny silver bladder as our cheap and nasty introduction to wine in our clueless youth - however casks have come a long way in the past half of a century			1
so much so that in 2015 , one in every three glasses of wine drunk in @entity3 actually comes out of a cask			1
a stark contrast to back in 1973 when the cask had n't taken off yet and drinking wine was only consumed on special occasions - hence each @entity3 only drank about 9.8 litres of wine per year			1
this figure jumped to 19.3 litres per capita consumption over the next decade as people really got into the boxed varietal			1
@entity28 , a member of the popular wine blog , taste - tested all casks that were taken out of their boxes , numbered and then pegged to the clothes line			1
@entity28 encourages wine lovers to check out the variety of cask wines that is now on offer			1
' if you have n’t ventured into the cask section of your local bottle shop lately , you ’re in for a treat			2
' cask producers have responded to the trend of consumers drinking less wine , but drinking better quality			1
' you ’ll now find real varieties and actual vintages , and even popular regions such as @entity64 and @entity65			0
' but enough about educational side of things - let 's find out what @entity28 's taste buds believe are the top of the line in the cask wine world			1
