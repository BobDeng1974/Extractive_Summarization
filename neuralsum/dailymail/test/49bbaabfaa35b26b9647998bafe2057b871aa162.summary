as the @entity1 draws closer , it is not just in the rugby heartlands that they are beginning to feel the excitement			1
@entity7 , as the home of rugby , may be gearing up to embrace the sport ’s biggest tournament , but on the other side of the capital , the @entity10 – built for athletics and destined to be a football ground - is also quietly preparing to get in the oval - ball act			2
in @entity18 , @entity16 , usually a footballing stronghold , is another ground about to host @entity21 ’s premier competition , and as former @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 prop @entity22 has been finding out , from the north east to east @entity27 , @entity25 is getting rugby - fever			1
@entity29 has been driving around the @entity1 venues preparing for the tournament @entity27 's @entity10 may not be a traditional rugby ground , but the buzz around the game is palpable ‘ going to all these places and seeing the buzz around the @entity1 already , is great , ’ says @entity35 on the drive between @entity37 and @entity7 , as he tours around the country visiting the stadiums that will host matches come this autumn as part of @entity43 's @entity42			1
‘ you kind of expect that kind of a buzz in rugby cities , like @entity50 and @entity51			1
but when you arrive in @entity18 and the guy who is fixing the cabinet comes over to you to talk about rugby , you realise there ’s a proper enthusiasm in places that are normally dominated by football			2
’ building that enthusiasm , with the prospect of high - calibre sport on the horizon , is one thing			0
but as everyone connected with the @entity10 knows , maintaining it after the competition is gone is another matter altogether			2
but @entity35 is confident that , long term , this @entity1 is going to have a lasting effect			1
‘ there are bound to be studies that come out , or bits of research , 15 minutes after the final whistle of the @entity1 final , and say there are only seven more children in @entity78 playing rugby than there were on tuesday , ’ he jokes			1
flats talks to @entity83 's @entity82 on arrival at @entity7 at the end of his ' @entity86 ' @entity25 came up short against @entity88 in the @entity89 , but their style of play earned plenty of plaudits ‘ but i think what it needs is a concerted effort to make as much noise , constructive noise , about the @entity1 as possible			1
’ at the heart of the ‘ legacy ’ debate , as it was with the @entity101 , is the discussion over grassroots sport , and it ’s something that @entity35 ’ tour has been focused on			1
‘ we went to a club in @entity110 , with @entity111 and @entity112 , and this is a club , with nothing , ’ he recounts			0
‘ they have absolutely nothing			0
part of the @entity1 legacy is they will receive upgrades to their facilities			2
now , at @entity121 or @entity122 , that means 5,000 extra seats			0
for them that means a shower			0
they do n’t have one			0
all this sort of stuff , that ’s the grassroots			0
’ of course , as well as investment and infrastructure , what this @entity1 will bring , @entity135 will hope , is an @entity25 team playing with confidence in front of their own fans			1
for the @entity1 to be the inspiration it has the potential to be , @entity25 ’s performances will matter			1
if @entity135 's side can repeat their flowing rugby at the @entity1 , they can win the sport fans @entity22 says picking the likes of @entity149 is key to @entity25 bringing in new fans during the tournament ‘ a lot of the buzz and the legacy around the @entity1 will be how @entity25 play , ’ admits @entity35			1
‘ how far they get is one side of it , another side is how they perform			0
‘ they did n’t do enough against @entity88 ( in last month ’s @entity89 ) because they did n’t win , but they were fantastic , and everyone loves it , and everyone forgives that			0
‘ so they want to win , first and foremost , but how they do so will have a big impact			0
’ playing attractive rugby is not just a question of attitude , it also depends on personnel , and that is why the former @entity25 prop is so glad to see the return of one of the country ’s most exciting players , @entity149			1
@entity149 may have a reputation as a ‘ pretty boy ’ but , for @entity35 , that ca n’t mask the fact that he is a top player			1
‘ he ’s not a prima donna			0
someone gets photographed at a fashion show , and has nice hair , and they say you ’re a prima donna			0
‘ @entity190 ’s got nice hair and big guns ; if he went to @entity50 fashion week he would n’t be a prima donna because he ’s a hard - nut flanker , and he ’s not a fly half			0
@entity149 was recalled for the @entity89 after impressing at club level over the past few seasons @entity35 says investment in the grass - roots will also be important if the @entity1 is to have a legacy ‘ you ca n’t have a prima donna in the forwards			1
why is @entity149 ? just because he ’s prettier and smaller			2
he ’s a good bloke and an amazing rugby player			2
‘ we talk about inspiring young people , who do you think the kids “ are ” in the playground now , playing rugby ? ‘ a lot of them will be saying , “ i ’m @entity149 ”			1
i thought he deserved to get back in the @entity25 squad and i ’m glad they picked him			2
’ so , if @entity25 play at their fluent best , and the grass roots get the funding they so badly need , could the rugby @entity1 produce a new generation of players and fans ? @entity35 thinks so , but only if the tournament is made accessible			1
‘ there ’s a big responsibility of commentators and pundits , without dumbing things down , to simplify things a bit , ’ he explains			0
‘ offer clarity , and make people who might be first time watchers , like they understand it more			0
‘ if that understand can join the enthusiasm that is clearly building , @entity25 could have a tournament with lasting legacy – and not just in south west @entity27			2
to follow @entity42 , tune into @entity240 on monday 13th and 20th april at 8pm live on @entity43 1			0

former @entity25 prop @entity29 says the ' buzz ' around @entity1 is growing
@entity35 says with the right ' constructive noise ' , competition can build rugby
@entity25 will need to play exciting rugby to capture *public* 's *imagination*
recalling the likes of @entity149 is a step in the right direction
