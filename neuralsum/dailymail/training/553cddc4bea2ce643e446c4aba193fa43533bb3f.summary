according to prison and court records , @entity9 slipped out of handcuffs while being transferred from a cell and punched a prison officer in the face			2
he bloodied the officer 's nose and finger , and threatened to kill the officer 's family			0

' @entity9 spent much of his time behind bars in solitary confinement and had a long record of disciplinary violations			2
records show he joined a white supremacist prison gang			0
