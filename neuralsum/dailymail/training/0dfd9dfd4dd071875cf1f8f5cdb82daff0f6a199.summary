they raise their rolled newspapers and chant to an image of @entity33 placed in a small recess in the wall in the @entity274			2
a steer lays on the ground during the running			0
many animals rights groups have denounced the event as cruel to the bulls several hundred runners or ' mozos ' are chased by bulls : the bull run begins with the runners chanting for protection as they stand just a few metres from the animals before running , runners or ' mozos ' raise their rolled newspapers and chant to an image of @entity33 asking for help panic : the early morning race saw thrill - seekers dashing alongside six fighting bulls and six bell - tinkling steers that try to keep the animals together against a backdrop of silence , they chant : ' a @entity33 pedimos , por ser nuestro patron , nos guie en @entity303 , ' translated as : ' we ask @entity33 , being our patron saint , to guide us in the bull run and give us his blessing '			1

although @entity5 is arguably the most famous of places for the running of the bulls , the tradition is carried out around @entity34			1
