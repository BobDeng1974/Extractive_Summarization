if you had to choose , who would you least want to travel with ? according to a new survey , @entity2 have selected their in - laws as the worst possible holiday companion ... with bosses and ex-partners not far behind			1
and when it comes to the type of holiday they 'd most like to avoid , many were quick to state that a cruise would be the absolute worst			0
according to @entity2 polled by sunshine.co.uk , a cruise with in - laws would be their least desirable holiday in the survey , conducted by sunshine.co.uk , camping and cottage or villa - style breaks were also listed as the worst type of holiday to go on if accompanied by their least favourite holidaymaker			1
the online travel agency also found that two - thirds of those who said their in - laws were the worst possible holiday companion had , perhaps unsurprisingly , been on holiday with them before			1
the poll was conducted as part of an ongoing study into the holiday habits of those around the @entity2			0
@entity39 polled 1,668 @entity2 , all of whom were aged 18 and over			2
is this you ? not likely ! 54 % of respondents replied that in - laws would make the worst holiday companions 1			1
in - laws - 54 % 2			1
bosses - 38 % 3			2
ex-partners - 37 % 4			2
parents - 25 % 5			0
children - 19 % initially , all respondents were asked to provide details of their worst possible companion to travel with and those polled could select all answers that they felt were applicable			1
those who selected in - laws were then asked to provide reasons for their choice			1
the majority ( 45 per cent ) said that they did not ' see eye - to - eye ' with them , while 31 per cent noted that their ' preferred holiday activities would differ			0
' coming in close behind , those polled agreed that taking an ex-partner on holiday would be terrible as well twenty one per cent confessed that they simply ' would not be able to relax ' if accompanied by their in - laws on holiday			1
the survey then asked exactly what type of holiday would the absolute worst to go on with such an undesirable companion			0
fifty six per cent of respondents stated that a cruise would be the worst , while 27 per cent admitted that they 'd least like to go camping			0
seventeen per cent agreed that a cottage or villa break together would be most unpleasant			0
another less than desirable travel partner ? your boss , according to 38 per cent of those surveyed @entity87 , managing director of sunshine.co.uk , said : ' we all know what it might be like to go on holiday with people who we think could be annoying ; after all , there is little opportunity to escape			0
' ' the results do make for tough reading for those with sons or daughters in - law , as it appears that the old - fashioned jokes about the in - laws still ring true today			2
' it 's not surprising that holidays spent in close confinement are the least favoured , so there is still hope for having a holiday with the in - laws and enjoying it , so long as you each have your own space			2
' as with anything , if you 're planning a holiday with others , make sure you take into account everyone 's tastes so no one feels they 've missed out on having a great holiday			0
