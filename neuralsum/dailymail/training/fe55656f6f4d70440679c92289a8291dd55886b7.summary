by @entity0 published : 21:11 est , 5 november 2012 updated : 08:08 est , 6 november 2012 @entity1 pictured with rock singer @entity2 at a rally in @entity4 , @entity5 yesterday @entity1 pledged to be the champion of @entity8 ’s embattled middle class in a desperate last - minute pitch for votes before the country goes to the polls today in one of the closest ever presidential elections			1
his chances of a second term were boosted last night after a final @entity18 poll gave him a three point lead , at 50 per cent of the national vote , ahead of his @entity22 challenger @entity21 on 47 per cent			1
earlier yesterday , however , polls by @entity24 and @entity25 both put mr @entity21 on 49 per cent and mr @entity1 on 48 per cent			1
the president used a rally in @entity4 , @entity5 , to deliver some of the soaring rhetoric which propelled him to power in 2008 , but which now rings hollow for many voters			2
he promised that he would use a second presidential term to fight for a more equitable @entity8 against opponents who sought only to help the rich elites			2
‘ i ’m not ready to give up the fight for the middle classes , ’ he said			0
‘ sometimes you have to fight , stand on principle			0
’ mr @entity1 was joined on stage by rock star @entity2 , one of nearly 200 celebrities who answered an 11th - hour @entity43 call to arms			1
with many @entity1 supporters feeling distinctly underwhelmed by his candidacy this time , the @entity44 have relied on stars and public figures to help drum up excitement and get people out to vote			1
they include pop stars such as @entity54 and @entity55 , and actors @entity56 , @entity58 and @entity59			0
while many confined their aid to talking to radio shows some , such as actor @entity63 in @entity5 , have been out canvassing , making phone calls and visiting local colleges			0
with the 17 - month , £ 1.9billion election campaign – the most expensive ever – boiling down to the outcome in a handful of swing states and one , @entity70 , in particular , both candidates pulled out all the stops in the final hours			0
the president also visited @entity70 and @entity105			2
@entity21 was in @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 as well as @entity70			1
mr @entity21 rubbished mr @entity1 ’s economic record and his claim to have helped the middle class , which he said was ‘ being squeezed ’ with high unemployment as well as rising prices for everything from insurance to petrol			1
‘ do you want four more years like the last four years ? ’ he asked a crowd in @entity118 , @entity106			0
ramming home his determination to create jobs and slash government spending , he said : ‘ my vision is to limit government rather than limit the dreams of our fellow @entity8			0
’ the election hangs on a knife edge			0
all predictions show there is barely any difference in support and this could be the closest contest since @entity133 took on @entity134 in 2000			0
however , the @entity1 camp has been buoyed by electoral number - crunching which gives him the edge in winning most of the crucial ‘ battleground ’ states			1
it is also becoming clear that mr @entity1 may have benefited in the polls from @entity142 which not only showed him handling the devastation but also kept mr @entity21 out of the public eye for three crucial days			1
what remains certain is that neither contender is going to receive a ringing endorsement from the electorate , as mr @entity1 did four years ago			1
both men will know that as many @entity8 will have voted against them as voted for them			0
the pair ’s choice of stops on their final day of campaigning emphasised where they believe they might clinch the election , with mr @entity1 concentrating on the @entity157 and mr @entity21 on the south			1
neither passed up on a chance to re-visit @entity70 – for mr @entity21 , his 44th visit during the campaign			2
the industrial @entity157 state has picked the winner of the past 12 elections and no @entity22 has clinched the @entity166 without winning @entity70			0
visiting @entity5 , @entity70 and @entity105 yesterday mr @entity1 concentrated on shoring up what he has called the ‘ firewall ’ of battleground @entity157 states which @entity44 believe will dash @entity22 hopes			2
after a final event in @entity174 , @entity105 , where he was introduced by first lady @entity175 , the couple flew to @entity176 where they will spend election day .			0
