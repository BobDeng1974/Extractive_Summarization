by @entity0 a @entity2 photographer was stunned to discover a mysterious flying vessel in the photos she took of a castle near @entity6			1
@entity8 photographer @entity7 and her mother visited medieval @entity11 castle last month and the 43 - year - old decided to take some photos of the picturesque landmark			1
she was using @entity15 , or @entity15 , images , where three or more pictures are taken at the same time and then overlapped for a rich image with the full spectrum of light			1
i want to believe : the high speed winged object snapped by @entity7 over @entity24 in @entity25 as she checked the pictures , she was amazed to find that one of the images , comprised of five overlapped images , featured a ' tubular - shaped object that had an s - shaped fin on it			1
' she told the @entity31 : ' we heard nothing , it was completely quiet out			0
the more i flipped through the frames , it was kind of creepy			0
' ' i 've been shooting for quite some time and i 've seen other stuff in the news , but i 've never seen anything [ like this ] with my own eye			0
' she added that the object was blurred at 1/250th of a second and was not in the frame before or after , so it had to be going incredibly fast			0
this is the same image , but after adjustments were made to the contrast to provide a clearer sense of the shape of the ' @entity51 ' through further tweaking of the photos she found that in the image following the appearance of the @entity51 on the right side , there was a portion of another object but on the left side of the exposure , giving the appearance that the ' craft ' had turned around at breathtaking speed			1
@entity65 , a former @entity66 special agent who has used his investigative skills to analyse thousands of videos and photographs of alleged @entity51 sightings said the images do not appear to have been manipulated			1
he said : ' the object 's appearance is internally consistent with the rest of the photo			0
for instance , look at the darker area of the underside of the object compared with the clouds			0
' having the sun in the frame is helpful because it indicates where shadows should appear			0
this further supports that the object was photographed ' in - camera ' and not added later			2
' however , he does not agree that the object appears to have doubled back on itself and speculates that it 's probably a insect as the ' fins ' could easily be wing protrusions			2
but while @entity95 is n't sure what she photographed over the @entity24 that day , she still looks up at the night sky and thinks there must be someone - or thing - out there .			2

@entity7 was taking pictures of the landmark last month
when she *reviewed* the pictures she was amazed to see mysterious ' craft '
@entity51 expert says photos are not faked - but are probably just an insect
