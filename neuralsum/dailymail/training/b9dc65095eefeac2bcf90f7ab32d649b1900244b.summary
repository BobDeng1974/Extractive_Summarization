would you fancy your chances in the ring against @entity3 , @entity4 of the world ? i foolishly thought i should give it a go last sunday at his @entity9 in @entity11 , @entity12			1
most fighters would have at least three months preparation for a fight , i had scarcely three hours sleep the night before and was looking a bit worse for wear			0
@entity19 eyed : @entity20 took on heavyweight champion @entity3 in the ring @entity20 ( left ) faced the champion after only three hours sleep with help of the gym 's trainers ( right ) it had been a heavy night			1
a couple of friends had come in from @entity29 and wanted to be shown @entity12 ’s night - life			0
we started off with drinks at the @entity33 and then on to hot new @entity35 club @entity34			0
at the club we bumped into an old friend @entity20 and the promises i ’d made to myself that i would have a quiet one prior to my sunday morning boxing session were evaporating fast			1
to make things worse i had broken my nose only the day before			0
a girl had accidentally elbowed me in the face ( she said it was an accident and i ’ll have to take her word for it ) , but she connected with such force that blood was streaming from the bridge of my nose and the bone was chipped			1
so picture if you will , the look on the former @entity53 ’s face as i ’m telling him to go easy on me because a girl broke my nose recently and i ’ve got a bit of a hangover			1
i asked if we could forego the boxing session and just do some photos together to publicise his new gym and boxing training sessions , he said no. the only thing i could do to make things better was to pop a @entity65 capsule to give me some extra energy and concentration before i went into the ring			1
i was given a quick lesson by @entity3 ’s trainers @entity70 and @entity72 on how to jab , hook and throw some combinations when in the ring with @entity3			2
the tuition came in handy but it did n't prepare me for @entity3 's imposing presence and intense stare , just holding a punch pad in one hand he looked menacing			2
@entity20 gears up to take on @entity3 @entity20 asked @entity3 if he could forego the boxing session as he had a bit of a hangover			1
@entity3 said no. @entity3 held up a hand for me and asked me to punch it as hard as i could			2
he moved his hand away long before my punch went anywhere close			0
i was nowhere near fast enough			0
following some supervision and guidance from @entity3 i started to improve and got into the swing of things and threw some good right hooks into the pad but after about ten minutes i started to realise that the fitness levels needed for boxing are off the hook			2
as i bent over out of breath @entity3 laughed and gave me a playful kick on the backside			2
i gained some confidence as the session went on and at one point in the video you can see me starting to get a bit cocky and i even faced off with @entity3 ( one minute six seconds in ) – like i would stand a chance if he launched a punch back			1
@entity20 advises having a nice early night before you contemplate going to the @entity9 this is a great work - out , and also a great lesson in self - defence for both men and women – and there were several women at the session that morning			1
the @entity9 training camp provides two hour elite training and conditioning sessions to the general public at affordable prices			0
it also gives members of the public the opportunity to train with , and use the same facilities as former @entity125 champion @entity3			1
my only advice is to have a nice early night before you contemplate going			0
the sessions are open to all from age 14 + regardless of fitness levels			0
