the eighth wonder of the world is nearing completion in the seventh tier of @entity5 football			1
in a park in the middle of a working - class suburb east of the city centre , builders are putting the finishing touches to @entity13 's @entity12			1
there are no pyramids , hanging gardens or light houses but there is a sweeping terrace , a series of football pitches and floodlight pylons			1
@entity13 of @entity24 's new 5,000 - capacity stadium @entity12 is nearing completion general manager @entity26 outside the new ground , which cost the democratic club a whopping £ 6.5m this a symbol that there is another way			1
another way a million miles away from billion - pound tv deals , fat - cat owners , sanitised stadia and all that many will tell you is wrong with modern football			1
set to host @entity45 for the official opening on may 29 , the 5,000 - capacity stadium will finally end a nomadic decade on the road for the breakaway outfit set up in may 2005 by @entity51 fans sick of being exploited by the club they loved , for whom the arrival of the @entity42 family was a step too far			1
@entity55 ( some mischievous souls voted for @entity57 in the naming poll ) , dismissed by many as an impossible dream , cost around £ 6.5m			1
of that colossal sum around half came from the pockets of the democratic club 's 4,000 members			1
the rest came from grants with around £ 500,000 loaned by the council			2
it is a ground for the fans , paid for by the fans			1
the function room at the new ground is part of a stadium that will also serve the local community @entity12 is a far cry from the glamour and glitz of @entity80 , seven miles away across the city but is it two fingers up at the debt - burdening @entity84 still in charge seven miles across the city ? ' that 's a daft question , ' says general manager @entity26			1
' establishing this football ground is a statement of what football supporters can achieve if they are given the opportunity , ' he adds			1
they are strong words from a man who believes in standing up for what he believes in			2
far from marching proudly into a new stadium , 25 years ago @entity26 , now 52 , was nervously stepping into a prison cell for non-payment of poll tax			1
it was those principles that saw him leave behind a steady job as a driving instructor ( with a wife and two kids to support ) to take his current role leading the rebels with a cause in 2006 and , with a heavy heart , vow never to set foot inside his beloved @entity80 again until the @entity113 were gone			2
@entity55 , with its view of the bright lights of @entity117 across the valley , is a far cry from today 's @entity80			0
it is also not your identikit , breeze - blocked modern stadium			2
behind one goal is a 2,500 - capacity terrace , salvaged from @entity126			0
the changing rooms at the new ground are simple , but @entity129 says the club are ambitious for progress on matchdays one of the stands will house a food market , with local businesses from @entity137 takeaways to vegan cafes offering fans their fayre			1
in the clubhouse supporters will not drink @entity142 , or @entity143 but cask ale from @entity24 brewers @entity145			2
the local brew of the day 's opposition will also be imported for each match while the club is planning to install a microbrewery			2
dozens of volunteers have helped to build it			0
one fan donated a lift			0
fruit trees will make it the first pollinator - friendly football ground in the country			1
discussions , however , are ongoing over the pies			0
' we have to get that one right , ' says @entity26 , but the provider will be a local firm in line with the club 's policy			1
the physio room will turn into a medical suite for the community on non-match days and there is a classroom for the club 's academy and for the use of those from the surrounding area			1
on the back of the main stand there is wooden cladding – a nod to the wooden sleepers of the @entity186 which spawned the first incarnation of @entity51 just down the road in @entity189 136 years ago			0
@entity129 explains the plans for the stadium to @entity193 's @entity192 ( right ) at the new ground ' we 're a mile away from @entity196 ( @entity189 's first ground ) , ' says @entity26			1
' we wanted to be within the @entity199 ring road			0
that we are so close to where it began is a happy coincidence			0
' @entity26 , born and raised a stone 's throw from the @entity205 , is expecting a 20 per cent rise on the club 's already impressive average attendances of 2,000 as they seek to end four years of play - off heartbreak and gain promotion to the @entity212			1
it sounds conservative , but he does admit to having one eye on the future and what feels like an inevitable progression to the @entity218			0
' we 've got an opportunity to use the revenue we generate to invest in our club , ' he says			2
' this is not just a ground that has been built for the level we are at			2
we want promotion this year and we will continue to press our way up the leagues as resources allow			0
' so will @entity26 , whose side need a maximum of five points from their remaining three matches to secure the title , be sat in the director 's box when the dream is finally realised and the teams run out ? ' no , ' he says			1
' i will be stood on the 18 - yard line of the end we are attacking			0
that 's my preferred spot			0
' the club 's badge features a ship , to showcase the city 's canal - building past , explains @entity129 the club was formed when @entity51 were bought by the @entity84 @entity42 in 2005 he , like the club , does things differently			2
fc fans call it @entity255			2
for @entity26 , however , it is an extension of a longstanding @entity259 tradition			1
' there 's a spirit in @entity24 of radicalism and creative thinking , ' he says			0
' of challenging the norm and looking at different ways of doing things			0
everything from electoral reform – the establishment of the suffragette movement to innovation in industry			0
' the first ever computer , the first ever public library and the first ever public park			0
our crest itself speaks of that			0
the ship is because we built the canal			0
we brought the sea into the centre of @entity24			0
it 's on our city crest , it 's on our club crest			2
' unfortunately , @entity26 has to leave to try and push the project over the line			1
the @entity13 team in 2005 , when they played as a nomadic club without a ground the club 's fans turned their back on the commercialism of @entity80 and started a democratic club time for one last question			1
sir @entity299 famously had little time for @entity13 and having the audacity to mention them at a press conference destroyed the relationship one local reporter enjoyed with the @entity306			0
the latest incumbent , however , is a son of @entity308 , where they know all about challenging authority and doing things a little differently			0
so will @entity312 find a ticket to a match at @entity12 on his doormat ? ' that 's a good question , ' @entity26 says			1
' we have no plans to invite anybody form @entity51 to a game			0
' after a long pause he adds : ' we would , however , have no objections if they wanted to attend			0
' if they do they will have to join the queue .			0

@entity12 will host @entity45 for opening on may 29
new stadium will serve community on non-match days
the £ 6.5m ground was *financed* *largely* by fans of the democratic club
general manager @entity26 describes new stadium as a ' statement of what football supporters can achieve '
