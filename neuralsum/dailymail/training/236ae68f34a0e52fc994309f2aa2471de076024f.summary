the husband of brain - dead woman whose right - to - die battle in @entity3 sparked national outrage has slammed then - governor @entity5 as ' vindictive ' , ' untrustworthy ' and ' a coward ' @entity7 lived in a vegetative state from 1990 to 2005 following a cardiac arrest as doctors kept her alive with feeding tubes			1
throughout the 15 - year battle , her husband @entity13 said , @entity5 fought with the courts to prevent her euthanasia			1
' i would n't trust him in any type of political office			0
' insisting that the ' thinking part ' of his wife 's brain no longer functioned , @entity13 - and numerous physicians - called on the state , and the federal government , to let her die			1
however , her @entity40 parents , and their privately hired physicians , disputed the diagnoses and adamantly opposed euthanasia			1
in april 2001 , a court ordered for the tube to be removed - but it was inserted days later following an appeal			1
in february 2005 , a @entity49 judge ordered for the tube to be removed - prompting president @entity51 to sign legislation designed to prevent the order			1
however , the court upheld its ruling			0
on march 18 the tube was finally removed			0
on march 31 , 2005 , @entity13 died			1
died : on march 18 the tube was finally removed			2
on march 31 , 2005 , @entity13 died it has since emerged that @entity5 , then governor of @entity3 , wrote to prosecutor @entity60 following @entity7 's death , to say : ' i urge you to take a fresh look at this case without any preconceptions as to the outcome			1
' he called on @entity60 to check how long it took @entity13 to call 911 after his wife 's initial fall			1
however , @entity60 found no evidence of criminality			2
ten years later , as @entity5 reveals plans to potentially succeed his father and brother in the @entity76 , @entity7 is livid			1
he lambasts the younger @entity51 for siding with his wife 's parents , pushing executive power to its limits , and never getting in touch following the debaucle			2
he told @entity28 : ' i 've had politicians come to my home and apologize to me for what they did to me ... but i never heard from @entity5			2
' he says he relishes the prospect of meeting @entity5 if he decides to attempt a rapprochement during his 2016 campaign			0
' bring it on , ' @entity7 said			0
almost 10 years later and i still have n't heard from you			0
' was he afraid to meet with me ? to see me ? why ? that 's what burns me			0
you got so much to say — but where are you ? you lost against this little ordinary man from @entity98			0
and then to continue on ? unspeakable			0
' why ? give me an answer			0
why ? why ? what was @entity13 to you ? why ? tell me why			0
why do you think you had the right to be involved ? why would you put me and my family through hell ? and what did you gain from that ? and after you lost , why did you pursue it ? what did you gain from that ? ' he made life , for a lot of people — the nursing home people , the local police , lawyers — he made everybody miserable			0
' ' it was appalling , ' @entity120 , one of @entity13 's attorneys and the author of @entity123 vs @entity124 , told @entity28			2
' and i think it 's important for people to understand what @entity5 is willing to do			2
it 's important for people to know who @entity5 is , and the @entity13 case tells us a great deal about who @entity5 is			1

@entity13 was left brain - dead for 15 years after cardiac arrest in 1990
@entity142 called for her to be allowed to die , her @entity40 parents opposed him - and @entity145 government supported the parents
physicians ' tests found ' thinking part ' of @entity7 's brain was dead but her parents ' private doctors opposed diagnoses , @entity5 supported them
in 2001 a court ruled to remove the tube , but was *overruled*
after she died in 2005 , @entity5 called on prosecutor to *investigate* @entity13 for criminality
now , as @entity5 runs for president , @entity7 brands him ' vindictive '
