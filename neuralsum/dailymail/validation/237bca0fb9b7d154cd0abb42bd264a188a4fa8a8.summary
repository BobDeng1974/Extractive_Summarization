the way is now clear for @entity2 chief executive @entity1 to be promoted to executive chairman following the removal of one potential source of embarrassment			1
his former temporary personal assistant @entity7 made a claim last june of sex discrimination and harassment after she caused a furore by leaking a sexist email exchange between @entity1 and tv rights lawyer @entity13			0
but @entity14 , 41 , now wants to move on , according to a friend , and a planned employment tribunal case will not go ahead			0
@entity1 is expected to have his elevation rubber - stamped at the @entity2 summit a week on thursday , especially as the clubs are flush with the proceeds of the £ 5billion domestic tv rights deal orchestrated by @entity1 and have more billions to come from the overseas market			1
the appointment of an executive chairman will need a statute change and to ensure there is some counterbalance to @entity1 getting everything his own way , it ’s likely the @entity2 will also appoint two new independent directors			1
@entity1 is set to be promoted to @entity2 's executive chairman @entity33 , president of world cycling ’s @entity34 , is taking the lead in testing men and women competing in the same race after @entity41 president @entity40 promoted the idea for future @entity43			1
the @entity34 are putting on a trial involving @entity46 under 23 riders at their @entity47 in @entity48 on friday , when they will experiment with sprints and other races			0
data from sports scientists show men are 10 to 15 per cent stronger and fitter than women cyclists			0
@entity40 has promoted the idea of men and women competing together in future olympics @entity60 chief executive @entity59 feels no need to apologise for his pro-england tweet that upset sensitive fans of pool rivals @entity64			1
after seeing @entity67 ’s cricketers fail to get out of their @entity69 group , the 55 - year - old @entity65 posted : ‘ @entity70 fail to exit pool in @entity69 ... not the words we want to hear during # @entity73			2
’ speaking at the @entity74 on tuesday , @entity59 said every event organiser wants the host nation to do well , but is confident of @entity70 hosting the most successful ever global rugby tournament whatever the fate of @entity80 ’s team			2
@entity60 chief executive @entity59 sparked controversy for his comments about @entity70 qualifying drawing pools for the @entity69 three years before the kick - off led to the farce of @entity64 , who had briefly slipped out of the world ’s top eight , being in the same group as @entity70 and @entity65 when the three are currently ranked fourth , fifth and sixth			1
that is going to change for @entity93 2019 , with the draw moving back by at least a year			0
@entity60 chief @entity59 would also like bidding contracts for the 2023 @entity69 to forbid the online secondary sale of tickets			2
@entity98 get a 2015 drive on @entity100 , whose serious upset over the way @entity70 rugby players behaved on an infamous sponsors day during the @entity106 resulted in them not renewing their @entity108 official vehicle sponsorship , are nevertheless still sufficiently engaged with the sport to be backing @entity98 ’s coverage of this year ’s tournament			1
seven players involved in driving @entity100 that day are either still in or on the fringes of @entity80 ’s squad			0
one player wrote in the leaked @entity108 @entity69 report : ‘ it was four hours of being stuck in a car driving slowly to satisfy following tv cameras — there were even tv cameras filming from helicopters			0
there was no fishing , no surfing , no bbq and more importantly no @entity127 ’ another player added : ‘ we were told we were n’t allowed to do any commercial stuff during the @entity69 but here they ( @entity100 ) were exploiting us on our day off to promote their brand			2
’ @entity100 will be sponsoring @entity98 's coverage of the @entity133 later this year @entity100 did not renew their deal with the @entity108 in the wake of @entity70 's @entity106 campaign the speedy turnover in the international cricket calendar that sees @entity70 ’s @entity140 squad named on wednesday after tuesday ’s debrief of the @entity69 shambles is very fortunate for head coach @entity143 and managing director @entity144			1
it allows them to move quickly on to the @entity148 tour when a more lengthy analysis of @entity70 ’s dismal failure to get out of their group at the @entity69 after six months of uninterrupted one - day cricket would surely have resulted in both men being axed			0
@entity70 coach @entity143 will switch attention back to the longer form with a test team announcement			0

@entity1 to be promoted to @entity2 executive chairman
@entity34 to test the idea of men competing *alongside* women
@entity59 feels no need to apologise for @entity167 tweet
@entity100 to sponsor @entity98 's coverage of the @entity69
@entity140 team to be announced on wednesday after @entity69 exit
