@entity0 could scarcely believe his eyes as @entity2 bizarrely hitched up his trousers before raising his finger and sending the @entity6 captain on his way			1
he had gone so far towards the test century that would mean more to him than any of his other 25 , but ultimately he had fallen just five runs short			0
the @entity11 umpire had quite rightly detected the thinnest of bottom edges through to @entity14 as @entity0 had shaped to pull the spin of @entity16 and cut short the innings that had done so much to salvage his career			0
it did not stop the @entity21 crowd giving @entity0 a rousing reception in keeping with the support he has received throughout his struggles , but it was a cruel moment for a captain who had battled so hard to keep his reign afloat			2
if @entity47 ’s felt like rock bottom for the ‘ new ’ @entity6 and their captain then the first day of the third test was perhaps the start of the climb back up , with @entity0 showing he is not going to give up on his leadership without one hell of a fight			1
a score of 247 for two , with @entity57 continuing the impressive start to his test career with another hundred , is not exactly a cause to crack open the champagne but , for an @entity6 side in desperate need of a boost , it is a start			1
at the centre of it was @entity0 who , after a run of 27 innings without a hundred and growing concerns about his captaincy ability , surely could not have survived another failure here whatever the rest of this test has in store for his team			2
@entity0 could have taken the easy way out after winning the toss on another greenish pitch and bowled first , particularly with a four - man seam attack freshened by the inclusion of @entity83 and @entity84 at his disposal			1
yet it was a measure of his mettle that he faced up to his moment of destiny and realised that if @entity6 could get through the first morning then there should be runs to be had on what looks an excellent @entity21 surface			1
he would have known that @entity6 ’s supporters are still with him as a roar greeted his march to the crease with @entity98 to face an @entity29 side without their lord ’s tormentor @entity100 , who pulled out with an ankle injury			2
yet those calls for @entity0 ’s head would reached a crescendo had he been caught by @entity16 , as he should have been , on 15			0
luck , for once , was on his side and what followed was an innings similar to the century against @entity109 four years ago at the @entity110 that saved him at a similarly low ebb			0
it was not exactly a flawless display , with @entity0 driving @entity114 loosely through gully on 33 and then almost running himself out on 68 , but it was full of the cussed character that lurks within such a mild - mannered exterior			0
loud : the @entity119 fielders appeal after @entity0 edged a @entity16 delivery behind colourful : fans in fancy dress enjoy themselves on the first day of the third test focus : @entity0 was given a couple of chances , but fought hard for his 95 runs @entity0 overtook @entity128 and @entity129 to become @entity6 ’s third - highest test run - scorer with his 95 on sunday			1
@entity131 8181 8 - @entity0 and @entity98 finally recorded their first half - century partnership , after eight innings opening together 2,000 - @entity0 became the ninth player to score 2,000 @entity45 runs as @entity6 captain			1
@entity137 has the most ( 3,815 )			0
when he reached 22 , @entity0 went past the test run - tally of @entity128 , whose sacking after the @entity140 horror show continues to cast such a giant shadow over @entity6 ’s attempts to move on without him			1
then , when he had scored 70 , @entity0 moved past @entity129 to leave only @entity143 and @entity131 ahead of him , a measure of the player he has been for @entity6 and still , at 29 , should be in the future			2
maybe now he will have regained the confidence to believe that he is back on course to overtake @entity131 and go on to become the first @entity6 batsman to score 10,000 @entity30 runs			0
that elusive 26th test century , one that has looked further and further away as failure has followed failure , looked assured on sunday until , understandably , he displayed some nerves in the 90s and missed two golden opportunities on his favourite cut shot to hurry towards three figures			0
heat : @entity159 ( left ) loses his shirt as the @entity162 commentary team feel the heat on the balcony relief : @entity0 won the toss and decided to bat first on a greenish looking pitch in @entity169 video a great day for @entity6 - @entity0 rare : the match at the @entity21 marked the first time in @entity174 cricket that a @entity45 began on a sunday @entity175 : @entity57 was unbeaten on 104 as he continued his strong international start moment : @entity6 's @entity178 punches the air after scoring his third century in six @entity45 @entity0 was denied a century when he edged a ball from @entity16 — a fact confirmed by @entity183 , though he was dropped on 15			1
@entity16 then ensured it was not to be but if @entity0 can get back to leading by example , as he did when @entity6 won in @entity29 , then perhaps everything else will fall into place			0
he will certainly take to the field when @entity29 bat in much more positive mind			0
a big total to defend would help and @entity192 , who is scoring prolifically for @entity6 without yet tasting victory , has taken them a long way towards the sort of score that would allow @entity0 and @entity6 to call the shots			0
@entity57 was tested to the full , with giant @entity119 debutant @entity199 impressing in @entity100 ’s place , in a nervy passage after @entity98 had again played at a ball he could have left outside off - stump and fallen to @entity203			2
but clearly @entity192 has the right temperament for @entity45 and came through to reach the century , his third in just six tests along with two other half centuries , that @entity0 would dearly have loved to record			0
troubles : @entity98 was caught by @entity16 in the slips for 26 in the morning session ovation : @entity6 's under - pressure captain received a warm reception from the crowd he too could have fell early and was grateful for another excellent umpiring decision , this time when @entity217 turned down appeals for a caught behind with @entity57 on 10 , but grew in assurance during a stand of 158 with @entity0			1
the one umpiring glitch came late on when @entity222 was highly fortunate to escape being lbw before he had scored , but he survived until the close and has the chance to follow @entity0 ’s example and fight his way out of trouble on monday			2
@entity6 ’s scoring rate means they are not yet in command but they have the potential to be by close on day two and that position and his own contribution would have made @entity0 sleep more soundly .			1

@entity0 caught behind for 95 on day one of third test at @entity21
@entity6 reach 247 - 2 at stumps after winning toss and batting first
@entity57 unbeaten on 104 at close with @entity222 on 16
@entity98 out for 26 in morning session after being caught in slips
@entity6 made three changes with @entity244 , @entity84 and @entity83 coming into team
