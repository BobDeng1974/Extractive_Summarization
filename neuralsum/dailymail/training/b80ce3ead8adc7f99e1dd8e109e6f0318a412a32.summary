@entity1 , 51 , was saved by medical student @entity4 after his heart stopped for 22 minutes ‘ to be dead for 22 minutes is a bit scary , it just puts everything into perspective of what i could have lost , i have finally now decided to hang up my boots and retire			1

‘ i walked over and they were putting him in the recovery position which i did n't feel was adequate so i asked if they were medical and they were n't so i decided to take charge			0
