each december , when the draw for the second round of the @entity2 takes place at @entity5 headquarters on the banks of @entity7 , the ties always look so appealing for the @entity10 sides			1
there are a few ‘ oohs ’ and ‘ ahhs ’ as @entity5 general secretary @entity17 presides over the draw , but generally we are cocksure about the @entity10 teams chances of reaching the quarter - finals			1
when @entity18 draw @entity19 again , we convince ourselves that the @entity20 are not the team who redefined the game when they won the @entity2 in 2006 , 2009 and again in 2011 at @entity24			1
@entity25 scored a terrific double to condemn @entity18 to defeat at the @entity28 on tuesday the former @entity30 man slots home his second as @entity19 cruised to victory over their rivals @entity34 was in top form despite missing a penalty as @entity19 produced a masterclass performance on tuesday night , @entity34 and @entity25 wiped the floor with @entity18 at the @entity28 and will wonder how on earth they only won that first leg won 2 - 1			1
so , 24 hours later we moved on to the @entity43 , brainwashed into believing that @entity44 were the weakest team left in the competition because they scored only one goal in the group stages			2
they kept five clean sheets in six group games , too , but again there was conviction in the air when @entity55 sent out a team with five hugely influential forwards in his side			0
@entity55 looks on during the shock @entity2 defeat at home to @entity62 - side @entity44 @entity44 ’s response was to rely on a classic @entity65 model of counter-attacking football , scoring three times to surely put this tie beyond the reach of @entity70 in the @entity71 on march 17			1
only the hippest hipster will pretend he knew too much about the way @entity44 would approach this game before they trained at the @entity43 on tuesday night			2
the rest of us were simply guessing			0
so was @entity55 and as tough as this may sound on a guy who has taken team to the 2006 @entity2 final against @entity19 , he was exposed tactically			1
it was brutal , and ruthless			0
for all his other qualities , too numerous to mention here , plotting the downfall of the an opponent at the highest level is an area of the game has never been the @entity70 manager ’s forte and it is not use pretending otherwise			2
in @entity65 , a sharp tactical mind , is gold			0
@entity98 ( right ) dominated the midfield and scored the opening goal for the visitors former @entity103 striker @entity102 came back to haunt his rivals to score the second goal @entity106 scored a late third to put @entity44 in control ahead of the second leg in @entity62 @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 and the three - time @entity2 winner @entity113 are among the great tacticians at this level			1
@entity55 does not belong in that category			0
@entity70 approached this first leg like they would a home game against @entity119 or @entity120 in the @entity121 , expecting to wallop them and send the fans home happy			2
what a mistake to make as goals from @entity98 , @entity102 and the substitute @entity106 deep into injury time piled on the misery			0
this is @entity65 football , where the sharpest and most astute tactical minds plot and plan the two legs weeks in advance			0
for all his faults @entity112 approaches these ties like a battleship commander , placing himself in every single scenario ahead of these mammoth @entity65 ties			2
it is the only way			0
@entity112 ( centre ) has become a tactical mastermind in the @entity2 and his results say that it is one of the reasons why the @entity145 manager , who won the @entity2 with @entity146 in 2004 and again with @entity147 in 2010 , has been so successful in this elite environment			1
predictably , wearily , it feels like it is time for another radical rethink of the @entity10 game after the gung - ho approach of @entity18 and @entity70 this week			1
we are going soft here , fellas , and going out			0
for @entity18 to progress they will have to score a minimum of two goals in @entity159 on march 18			2
@entity70 will need at least three			0
sure , it is not over yet , and there will be many who point to the success of the @entity10 teams in this competition over the past few seasons			0
@entity167 ( right ) has been critcised by some fans for getting his tactics and team selection wrong @entity172 beat @entity145 in @entity173 ( 2008 ) , they lost badly in the final to @entity19 ( 2009 and 2011 ) before @entity175 at last got his hands on the @entity2 in the @entity177 in 2012			1
there is a sense that the @entity10 game got a bit too giddy , but then how does that explain @entity112 ’s five successive semi-finals , from 2010 to 2014 with @entity147 ( when they won it ) , @entity185 and @entity145 ? the reason is because he plans for every eventuality , reasoning that the more information he can pass on his players the better the chance they have of getting through			1
as @entity55 has been reminded yet again , sending 11 men out with a ball just wo n’t wash at this level .			0

@entity10 sides were tactically outwitted in some @entity2 games
@entity19 and @entity25 *comfortably* *dispatched* of @entity18
@entity70 *underestimated* @entity44 and were brutally *punished*
@entity112 has an *impressive* *pedigree* in the @entity2
