hamsters can carry almost half their body weight in their cheeks , and now this impressive feat has been caught on camera in an unprecedented way			1
using x-rays , researchers from the @entity7 filmed a @entity10 hamster in cage storing nuts and pieces of fruit in its cheeks			2

the show explores the ‘ wide side of playful pets ’ , and also reveals why hamsters love to run on a wheel , how dogs pick up the rules of the pack , and how kittens learn to be solitary hunters			2
