by @entity0 for @entity1 it is the old dilemma : what do you do when there 's a big football match on but you 've been invited to a wedding at the same time ? sneak a radio into the service to keep up with the action , or behave with dignity and enjoy the couple 's big day ? were you invited to this @entity15 couple 's wedding , however , one suspects you would not have to make the tricky decision			1
the bride and groom decided to theme their wedding around @entity22 , with everything from their clothes to the wedding cake featuring @entity28 branding			1
while the bride is wearing a traditional white dress , she can also be seen with a red flower in her hair and so sports the club 's colours			1
just for good measure the groom has ' just married ' printed on the back of his kit			0
sponsors will be pleased : the @entity15 couple had their cake decorated with red icing and a @entity67 logo the cake is decorated with red icing plus several @entity67 logos in a nod to the club 's home kit for the 2013 - 14 season			1
the wedding car appears to be one part of the wedding that escapes the @entity22 treatment , but a closer look at the silver @entity81 shows that it is also decorated with red and white flowers			2
there is also a large @entity22 flag draped over the rear window			0
let 's hope the marriage is a match made in heaven , like when sir @entity90 joined the club , and does not end in a quick divorce , such as when @entity93 took over last season			0
like our @entity22 facebook page			0
driving pass : the wedding car looks like any other until you realise that the flowers are red and white rear window : the back of the car was also draped in a large flag featuring @entity22 's club badge			2
