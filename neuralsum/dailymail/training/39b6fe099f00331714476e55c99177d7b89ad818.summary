jams : friday afternoon is set to be the busiest time on the roads for the entire @entity3 period journey times on some major roads could more than treble as motorists start the great friday @entity3 getaway , experts have revealed			1
traffic specialists @entity10 said tomorrow afternoon from 4pm will be the busiest time over @entity3 , with up to 20million cars on the road			0
they are blaming a toxic combination of the usual friday peak with the start of the school holidays and early @entity3 break - ups for some workers			1
@entity10 said other busy days will include next tuesday and december 27			0
major motorways including the @entity21 , the @entity22 and the @entity23 are expected to be the worst affected			1
the @entity22 ’s anti-clockwise stretch between junction 23 and junction 10 is predicted to take around two hours and 20 minutes - compared to a normal 40 - minute journey time			1
the road with a 70mph limit will see speeds drop to just 18mph , said the @entity10 report			0
despite extra lanes now in play , it adds to the @entity22 ’s reputation as ‘ the biggest car park in @entity37 ’ drivers on a 60 - mile section of the @entity21 northbound between junction 21 and junction 32 will see an hour - long journey soar to 2 hours and 25 minutes , more than double the usual time			1
fifteen - minute journeys are set to almost quadruple to 55 minutes on the @entity44 eastbound at junction 9 and the @entity46 northbound at junction 3 , with average speeds falling to just 14mph			1
one of the busiest ‘ pinch - point ’ exit routes out of @entity50 will also suffer jams			1
the already busy 14.5 mile stretch of the @entity53 westbound from @entity55 corner to @entity56 will take more than twice as long as normal to drive , increasing from 35 minutes to 1 hour and 15 minutes , said the report			2
in northern @entity61 the 17 - mile @entity59 northbound stretch through @entity60 will see journey times more than double from 20 minutes to 45 minutes , with speeds reduced to 22mph			1
there is a normal quieter period over @entity3 and @entity66 , with traffic picking up again on saturday , december 27 as drivers head home after spending @entity3 away , return to work or go shopping			2
pinch points : the ten worst spots on the roads , according to the report today by traffic specialists @entity10 meanwhile rail passengers also face @entity3 chaos over the busy festive holiday period - and are even being advised not to use a key @entity50 to @entity80 main line			1
engineering works will cause closures , delays , disruption and bus replacements			2
much of the £ 200million upgrades by 11,000 engineers are being performed on @entity3 and @entity66 , but delays will hit commuters throughout the festive period			0
repair work on the @entity92 main line means it will be shut between @entity94 station in @entity50 and @entity95 in @entity96 after the last trains on christmas eve until monday , december 29			1
it will also be closed between @entity99 and @entity100 after the last trains on christmas eve until sunday 28 december			0
rail bosses say the now almost traditional @entity3 repair closures are vital as work continues on ‘ improvements ’ in the @entity106 area and between @entity99 and @entity100			1
to minimise disruption @entity107 and the @entity109 and @entity111 train companies are advising passengers to avoid the @entity92 main line and use alternative routes			0
but passenger groups say this is little comfort for those who have to endure the disruption en route to visiting friends and family			0
the @entity120 will be the worst affected , with 34 scheduled works , followed by motorways - @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity46 @entity56 will get off no more lightly , handling almost 700,000 passengers leaving from the west @entity50 airport between tomorrow and @entity3			1
of those , 116,700 will travel tomorrow			0
@entity126 will handle 800,000 departures between tomorrow and january 3 , with @entity128 in @entity129 handling 430,000			0
in addition around 380,000 will leave from @entity131 and 160,000 from @entity132			0
hundreds of thousands of people will also travel across the @entity134 by ferry or through the @entity136 , with 250,000 heading off on the high - speed trains of @entity138			2
@entity139 , lead scientist and traffic analyst at @entity10 , said : ‘ drivers would be well advised to steer clear of driving in the afternoon of friday december 19 as this will be the busiest period on the roads this @entity3			2
' there will be significant delays between 12pm and 6pm caused by a combination of the usual friday evening post-work peak , the start of @entity61 school holidays and people driving home for @entity3			2
‘ where possible , drivers should look for alternative routes to avoid the busiest roads , and travel outside of peak times			0
' it ’s worth bearing in mind that the shortest route is n’t necessarily the quickest and that drivers ’ normal routes may be worse hit by @entity3 traffic than other roads			0
' adverse weather can also have a significant impact on congestion , so check the forecast when planning a trip and try to avoid wet or especially cold periods			0

major motorways including @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 set to be worst affected
one 40 - mile trip on @entity50 *orbital* could take 2 hours and 20 minutes
experts blame friday peak combined with school and workers ' break - up
engineering work will also trigger string of closures on key rail lines
