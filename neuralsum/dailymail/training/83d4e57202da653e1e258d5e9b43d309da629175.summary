she accepts the risk that @entity4 ’s mobility may not improve following the skin removal operations - which are expected to cost around $ 16,000 - but says that is something she is prepared to support him in			1
initially the designer could not appreciate just how mr @entity4 had become so heavy			2
she told the recorder : ' i was never someone who made fun of heavy people but i am someone who ’s been very judgmental … i thought , how could he let this happen to himself ? ' but after seeing just how damaging and severe @entity4 's addiction was made her empathise with him , and she was inspired by his determination to lose weight			1
and when she learned of the cost that it would take to remove mr @entity4 's excess skin and the health problems it was causing , she resolved to help by setting up a web page to help him , and contacted him through @entity20			1

' i just felt compelled to reach out and just try to help and that 's all it was			0
' i have a lot of drive and just thought i could write letters and support			0
things i set my sights on , i just go and do			0
i just knew that i should try and help			0
' he 's incredible , a genuine person			0
incredibly honest and open about the difficulties he 's been through , which helped our relationship			0
' speaking about how their cyber relationship developed , @entity4 , of @entity88 , @entity89 , said : ' our first chat on @entity94 was over four hours and it just felt like we 'd been talking for years			1

she said : ' i got exhausted with dating			0
the people i would date … i did n't like myself as much when i was with them			0
' at the end of another four - hour @entity94 conversation with @entity4 , she announced : ' i really like you , ' and the two have been together ever since			1
as he was : as his weight soared to 70 stone , he was left unable to stand or walk before finally becoming bed - ridden and being looked after full time by council carers big appetite : at the height of his food addiction , he was eating an entire packet of bacon , four sausages and four eggs complete with bread and hash browns for breakfast after hours of @entity128 sessions and @entity20 chats , the couple met for the first time in real life this week			1

' the @entity7 wait until your weight plateaus , it 's a financial thing over here			2
' a doctor in @entity155 has offered her services to remove his excess skin for free			0
the only finances he has to find are the aftercare , the stay in hospital and the medication , which will cost around £ 12,000 , which @entity165 is now raising on a fundraising web page			0
speaking tearfully about the impact of the operation on his relationship , he said : ' it 's a question of whether she 's prepared to stay with me whether the next operation is successful or not and if i 'm in the wheelchair for the rest of my life			2
' miss @entity99 added : ' who is in there now is the person i love and whoever he is after the operation is irrelevant to me			2

as his weight soared he was left unable to stand or walk before finally becoming bed - ridden and being looked after full time by council carers			2
wheelchair bound : once he has the excess skin removed , he hopes he will be able to get out of bed more easily and be able to walk again firefighters had to demolish the front wall of his former home so they could drive a fork lift truck inside to lift him out and put him into an ambulance when he needed a hernia operation in 2002			1
