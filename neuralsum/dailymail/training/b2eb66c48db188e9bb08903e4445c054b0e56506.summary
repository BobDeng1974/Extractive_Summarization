by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 21:05 est , 16 november 2013 updated : 06:25 est , 17 november 2013 frightened passengers on board a @entity5 flight have told how they heard their pilot making a mayday distress call 36,000ft above the @entity8			1
the captain radioed for help when smoke filled the cockpit of the @entity5 plane - and accidentally turned on the public address system			1
the @entity15 was flying from @entity16 to @entity17 but had to make an emergency landing at @entity20 's @entity19			1
passengers on a @entity5 flight heard a pilot make a @entity25 distress call above the @entity8 ( file picture ) the @entity5 flight took off at 1.05pm last saturday with 220 people on board , the @entity27 reported			1
but just before 2pm the crew spotted smoke filling the cabin			2
after putting on oxygen masks they immediately contacted air traffic control			0
they switched on the cabin address system , and the start of their @entity25 call was heard by passengers			1
the flight had to land at @entity19 , with those on board told there had been an electrical fault			1
passengers then had to wait seven hours for a replacement jet to @entity50 in @entity17			1
some wrote about the incident on the @entity54 website , which logs emergency landings			0
one user , @entity56 , said : ‘ i will not fly @entity5 again			0
’ passengers had to wait seven hours at @entity19 for another jet to @entity50 in @entity17 ( file picture ) another , @entity61 , said : ‘ i was a passenger on board this flight with my new wife			1
‘ it was pretty frightening hearing the @entity25 call , but [ the ] flight crew said the @entity68 was accidentally turned on in the hubbub			1
the descent was controlled and landing heavy but again controlled			0
‘ staff at @entity72 could n't have been more accommodating and we were offered free refreshments whilst there courtesy of @entity5			0
’ it is believed the smoke was caused by a fan in the cockpit which overheated			2
the jet has already been returned to service			2
a @entity5 spokesman said : ' we flew engineers to @entity72 who inspected the aircraft and it was brought back to @entity16 where it was fixed in the following days , and returned to service			0
' we apologise to our customers who were diverted into @entity72			0
' the diversion was precautionary and we sent a replacement aircraft out to collect customers and get them to their destination as quickly as possible			2
' we understand any diversion is frustrating for our customers but we take safety very seriously and will always err on the side of caution			0
' another @entity15 - on the same route - made an emergency landing at @entity19 on thursday just an hour into crossing the @entity8			1
again the cause was a burning smell in the cabin - which is understood to have been caused by a faulty oven			0
readers of @entity54 warned electrical burning was what killed all 229 people on board a @entity109 flight over the @entity8 in 1998			0
in that case , a fire is thought to have begun in the cockpit and spread to equipment before it could be brought under control .			2
