ever since scientists have theorised that dark matter exists , concrete evidence of the elusive substance has continued to confound them			2
now , data from a number of gps satellites suggest that a halo of the strange matter may be surrounding @entity9 , causing our planet to be heavier than first believed			1
from his calculations , professor @entity12 from @entity13 claims this halo could affect the @entity9 's gravity and that the planet could be 0.005 and 0.008 per cent heavier than the mass established by the @entity19			1
a number of gps satellites have revealed that a halo of dark matter may be surrounding @entity9 , causing our planet to be heavier than first believed			1
dark matter is considered crucial to theories explaining how the universe is expanding and how galaxies interact this would be the equivalent of a disc of dark matter around the equator which is 191km ( 120 miles ) thick and 70,000 km ( 43,000 miles ) across			1
according to @entity19 , the current @entity9 mass is quoted as 5,972,000 , 000,000,000,000,000,000kg , or 5.972e24 kg. dark matter is considered crucial to theories explaining how the universe is expanding and how galaxies interact			1
it is thought to make up 27 per cent of the universe , but despite huge amounts of funding and research effort , experiments have so far failed to confirm its presence			0
in 2009 , researchers at the @entity48 in @entity49 , argued that changes in the speeds of space probes as they flew past the @entity9 could be explained by dark matter bound by @entity9 's gravity			1
using data on the satellites in the @entity64 gps , @entity57 glonass and @entity60 @entity59 groups , professor @entity12 measured @entity9 's mass as ' felt ' by each satellite			1
from his calculations , professor @entity12 claims the @entity9 is between 0.005 and 0.008 per cent heavier than the mass established by the @entity19 dark matter accounts for around 27 per cent of the universe			1
it surrounds galaxies across the universe , and is invisible because it does not reflect light			0
it can not be seen directly with telescopes , but astronomers know it to be out there because of the gravitational effects it has on the matter we can see			0
galaxies , for example , could not rotate the way they do and hold their shape without the presence of dark matter , researchers say			2
the @entity92 said : ' shine a torch in a completely dark room , and you will see only what the torch illuminates			0
' that does not mean that the room around you does not exist			0
' similarly we know dark matter exists but have never observed it directly			2
' scientists are fairly sure it exists and is crucial to the universe , but they do not know what it looks like or where to find it			0
the theory has now been put to the test by professor @entity12 at the @entity13 , according to a report by @entity114 in @entity115			2
using data on the satellites in the @entity64 gps , @entity57 glonass and @entity60 @entity59 groups , professor @entity12 measured @entity9 's mass as ‘ felt ’ by each satellite			1
as satellites orbit the @entity9 , their location in space is determined by the @entity9 's gravitational pull			1
by using the data and location of these satellites , professor @entity12 was able to estimate how strong this pull was , which in turn gave an indication to how heavy the @entity9 is			1
‘ the nice thing about gps satellites is that we know their orbits really , really well , ’ he told @entity115			0
professor @entity12 is now planning to factor in changes to the satellites ' orbits due to the gravitational pull of the sun and moon			1
if his calculations prove to be correct , satellites could help unlock some longstanding mysterious surrounding dark matter			2
scientists still have no concrete proof that dark matter exists , but the evidence for it is significant			0
galaxies , for example , could not rotate the way they do and hold their shape without the presence of dark matter , researchers say			0
the quest to find it is now gaining pace			0
last year one of the biggest quests in physics , the search for the enigmatic substance known as dark matter , failed to provide answers			0
the @entity167 ( @entity168 ) experiment , the world ’s most advanced test to find this elusive material , was unable to detect its presence after its first 90 - day run			0
a number of researchers are currently re-examining dark matter candidates once written off as unlikely , and considering unpopular ideas such as dark matter could be made out of something undetectable			0

@entity12 at @entity13 measured @entity9 's mass as ' felt ' by satellites
data from these satellites indicate the *strength* of @entity9 's gravitational pull
the gravitational pull is then directly *related* to the planet 's mass
he found our planet is 0.005 and 0.008 per cent heavier than first thought
that is the equivalent to a disc of dark matter around the equator which is 191km ( 120 miles ) thick and 70,000 km ( 43,000 miles ) across
