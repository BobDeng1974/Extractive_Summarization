by @entity0 published : 17:02 est , 19 december 2013 updated : 02:54 est , 20 december 2013 sir @entity1 beat his previous mark on @entity3 ? bagging the @entity4 £ 50,000 - but it could have been more had his knowledge of bricks been up to scratch			1
the former @entity4 manager appeared on the special live show , the last ever of the long - running series , with @entity10 , an avid @entity4 fan			1
@entity10 and @entity1 had previously appeared on the show together in 2004 , where they won £ 32,000			1
and @entity1 , who has a long habit of winning , was determined to beat his previous mark			2
then gained ' switch ' ) £ 75,000 - which of these creatures has three hearts ? @entity70 ( used ' switch ) - in which of these countries do residents pay half the usual amount of tax in december so they have more money for @entity36 ? @entity78 ( correct ) £ 150,000 - @entity80 name is given to the indentation on one side of a common brick ? @entity84 ( wrong , dropped back to £ 50,000 ) the @entity85 admitted to @entity86 before the questions started that he was still sore at only winning £ 32,000 last time			1
' i was devastated , ' he told @entity86			2
' we looked great at £ 64k , three lifelines , but we could n't do it			2
' he also admitted to being a quiz fan , with the @entity1 family regularly taking part in family quizzes at @entity36			1
' it 's very competitive			0
we get one of the grandson 's to do the questions			0
' @entity1 and @entity10 had a strong start rattling through the first few questions to get to £ 10,000 in no time			1
however , they did have to burn a lifeline on the fourth question , as they did n't know what the recent increase in minimum wage for over 21s had changed to			0
they asked the audience and went with the 83 per cent majority , who answered correctly , saying £ 6.31			2
the pair ran into a bit more trouble thereafter , however			0
they confidently answered that @entity54 had sold the record amount of cookbooks in the @entity49 , but on their next two questions they used a further two lifelines			0
the £ 20,000 question asked : ' @entity55 regularly had a ' @entity56 ' listed in her daily diary , indicating an appointment with her what ? ' they had to ring @entity129 , a journalist at the @entity130 , who said the answer was her hairdresser , although he ' was n't sure '			2
that was correct and so was the answer to the next question , which asked what was the most common surname in the @entity49 since records began			0
out of @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity54 and @entity142 , they beleived it was either @entity140 or @entity54 but decided to use their 50/50			0
easy : the first question raised a smile from @entity1 , and both answered it quickly secret fan ? @entity1 also knew the answer to question two , about the recent @entity151 show that 's not fair : the pair were even asked a football question slightly tougher : @entity1 and @entity10 did n't know that the minimum wage had been increased to ( @entity156 ) £ 6.31 @entity158 fan : the former @entity4 boss knew that @entity54 had sold a record number of books phone a friend : the duo had to ask a journalist to give them the answer to the question about @entity55 50/50 : answering this question correctly meant they were guaranteed to win at least £ 50,000 no answer : they had to use their switch lifeline to get out of answering this toughie this did n't help as it brought up the two names they had conferred over			1
however , they eventually went with @entity54 , which took them to the total of £ 50,000 , an amount that became their new minimum and added a lifeline , the switch , which allows for a change in question			1
they had to use it on their next go , not knowing that an @entity70 has three hearts			0
the next question seemed equally tough , asking about december tax laws in @entity196			0
delight : their guess of @entity78 took @entity1 and @entity10 up to £ 75,000 - @entity86 was also delighted walking away : sir @entity1 and @entity10 leave the stage after bagging £ 50,000 @entity1 and @entity10 took a guess that @entity78 reduce their tax in december so their citizens have more to spend at @entity36 , which was right , taking their total to £ 75,000			1
but they came unstuck on the next one with their big gamble			0
the question was worth £ 150,000 if answered correctly but would put them down to £ 50,000 if answered wrong			1
despite a long conference they believed a newt , rather than a frog , was on one side of a common brick			0
despite their gamble the pair were pleased with their earnings , knowing that they had beaten their total from 2004 and raised a huge amount for charity			0
backstage : @entity1 and @entity10 prepare for the show backstage at @entity17 studios return : sir @entity1 last appeared on @entity3 ? in 2004 partners : @entity1 was again teamed up with @entity10 all those years ago good cause : @entity1 and @entity10 eventually went on to win £ 32,000 in 2004			1

sir @entity1 appears on last *episode* of @entity3
former @entity236 manager takes part with tv *presenter* @entity10
@entity1 and @entity10 win £ 50,000 for the @entity4 foundation
