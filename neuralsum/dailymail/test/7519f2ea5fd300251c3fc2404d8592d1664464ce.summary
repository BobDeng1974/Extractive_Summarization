the @entity1 camp have scored a comprehensive win in the pr battle with the @entity4 without calling on any outside assistance			1
it has been assumed that the way @entity1 outplayed the @entity4 's army of media personnel at every turn was because his agents , @entity13 , had expert help guiding their strategy			1
but agent @entity16 , co-founder of the company with sir @entity18 , insists that everything has been done in - house since the brief involvement of former @entity23 editor @entity22 during @entity1 's supposed reintegration into the @entity4 team in 2012			1
@entity1 scored 170 for @entity26 in @entity27 as he bids to earn a recall to the @entity4 squad @entity16 said : ' we have just sat down together as a team with @entity1 and planned the best way forward			1
it does help on social media that @entity1 has a @entity36 following of nearly 2.5million			2
' and the @entity4 have totally misread the situation			2
you ca n't just keep briefing against someone			0
there are always two sides to a story and i think people now realise this			0
' @entity16 , once on the same @entity49 board as new @entity4 chairman @entity47 , added : ' @entity47 's words about @entity1 's future @entity4 chances have been interpreted in different ways but we believe there 's a clean slate			1
' @entity1 's agents have helped him outplay the @entity4 without any help from outside experts among the many issues that the @entity4 must sort out when writing a job description for their new director of cricket is what exactly @entity63 is doing to earn £ 300,000 - a - year as technical director of elite coaching — the same amount he pocketed when in supreme control of the @entity4 team			1
also , his current title does not differ a great deal from the ' director of cricket ' the @entity4 want to appoint and could easily lead to confusion over who is responsible for what			2
ridiculously , @entity63 was kept on by the @entity4 on huge money — basically as a thank you for services rendered — when there should have been a clean break after the @entity83 humiliation @entity84			2
@entity63 continues to earn £ 300,000 - a - year as the @entity4 's technical director despite his @entity83 humiliation @entity88 's @entity87 yesterday showed he no longer takes himself too seriously			1
he happily re-tweeted jibes that only four out of 100 members of the public recognised him in a poll for afternoon game show pointless			0
@entity87 was rather more annoyed a decade ago when @entity94 admitted he did n't realise @entity87 had played test cricket			0
the loud music played between overs in @entity98 has reinforced @entity101 chairman @entity100 's belief that banning musical instruments from @entity103 's is the right approach			0
@entity107 's @entity106 secret @entity108 , who acted as a @entity110 spokesman for the @entity112 family , has chosen the upcoming 10th anniversary of their @entity106 takeover to write a book about his six seasons as the @entity117			1
@entity108 , who remained a strange detached figure throughout his time involved with @entity106 eventually moving to @entity120 , has kept the book – more pr media study than revelationary and published on thursday by business in sport specialists @entity124 – a secret from @entity126			2
@entity108 said : ' i deliberately kept a lid on it because i did n't want it authorised in any way by @entity106			2
it 's a personal account and i have no idea what reception it will get			0
' not great , one suspects			0
former spokesman for the @entity112 family , @entity108 ( left ) , has written the ' the @entity137 ' it 's understood 40 - year - old @entity139 , who held up @entity4 with a dogged 46 , wants to continue in test cricket so he can play in the same @entity142 side as his promising 18 - year - old son @entity143			1
father and son have already represented @entity146 together			0
@entity139 wants to continue playing test cricket so that he can play with his son @entity143 @entity4 analyst @entity149 had to stay behind after play in @entity98 to use the wifi in the stadium press box because the connection was unreliable in the luxury team hotel at the @entity156 resort			1
@entity149 , who did a similar job for @entity159 cricket , says his previous employers were more keen on data despite @entity4 head coach @entity163 's perceived love of stats			1
@entity166 chairman @entity165 , the @entity4 representative in @entity98 , prefers to stay on a boat he has chartered rather than at the team hotel			0
guests on board include close friend sir @entity18			0
both @entity18 and @entity171 hope to build houses on plots at a new golf resort complex in @entity175 — where @entity18 is an ambassador — designed by the same architect who planned the @entity178 venue @entity179 in @entity180			0
