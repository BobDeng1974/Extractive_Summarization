star date 24102012 : we have detected evidence of a working tractor beam			1
two physicists working at @entity5 have developed a technique for using beams of light to draw a particle toward a source and claim to have demonstrated it experimentally			1
professor @entity12 and @entity13 , a graduate student , working at the @entity14 for @entity15 say they have realised the @entity18 - style technology - only on a miniscule scale			2
however , until now the technology has remained beyond the reach of real - world physicists , with the best they could manage being laser - based tweezers that can drag particles across microscopic distances in two dimensions			1
now in a paper published in the journal @entity46 - and available in full here - professor @entity12 and mr @entity13 describe a technology that goes one better , by actually pulling particles towards their beam 's source			2
it is well known that light can push objects - a property that forms the basis for the idea of using solar sails - but getting light to drag something has so far proved to be more difficult			2
the @entity5 tractor beam is based on @entity62 research published last year into a kind of laser called a @entity66 beam , which emits light in concentric rings			0
that study calculated that a such a beam could be designed to make a particle inside it emit photons on the side facing away from the beam 's source , forcing the particle to recoil towards that source			0
no - one has as yet been able to make such a beam , but the @entity5 researchers got around the problem by instead projecting two @entity66 beams side by side down a microscope and using a lens to angle them so they overlap			1
by varying the relative phase of the two beams , this technique traps the particle in a moving hologram they call an ' optical conveyor ' which allows ' bi-directional transport in three dimensions '			0
@entity96 explains how projecting the beams in this way creates a pattern of alternating bright and dark regions			0
by fine tuning the beam photons in the bright regions which flow past the chosen particle can be made to scatter backwards , hitting the particle and knocking it on towards the next bright region			0
however , the beam is not quite ready to snare a starship			0
professor @entity12 and mr @entity13 demonstrated their technology by moving microscopic spheres of silica suspended in water over distances of 30 micrometres			1
' this is still very much in its infancy , ' mr @entity13 told @entity96			0
nevertheless it opens the door to transforming science fiction into science fact - and @entity120 has already been in touch .			1

researchers have so far managed to move microscopic spheres of silica suspended in water over distances of 30 micrometres
but @entity120 have already been in touch *...*
