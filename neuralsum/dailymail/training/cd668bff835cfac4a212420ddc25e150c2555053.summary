the @entity0 was a tough battle			0
on one hand it was extremely exciting during the race – some of the best racing that i have been part of in a long , long time – but then afterwards , i was disappointed because i do n't like coming second , especially not to my team - mate ! however , there was a small part of me which remained proud because i started to understand what a great show we had put on , and that i had managed to contribute to that show , thus elevating my sport – the sport of @entity18 into people 's awareness , and boosting its popularity			1
that is important to me because i want @entity18 to be the most exciting sport in the world			2
the disappointment of coming second was the overriding factor , however			0
but it was n't a big issue , that ´ s racing and we have special emotions during a race			0
sometimes you shout in your helmet			0
but the important thing is that it has since been discussed			0
we went through everything as a team on thursday afternoon , here in @entity29 , and that 's what we do always ; it 's not just because of what happened in @entity35			1
we always discuss these sort of things as a team because it is important that we put it behind us and move forward as a team and that is exactly what we have done			0
so , the exciting @entity35 weekend is now behind us , and we move on full speed , keep racing and going flat out which is great , and it is fantastic and i am thankful to @entity79 that they let us race like that			1
it is great for the sport , great for us drivers , and great for everybody – even though @entity79 are taking a risk by doing that because it increases the chance that we have a collision			1
i think my rivalry with @entity26 is great			1
if we can keep it up and have battles like we did in @entity35 then it is exciting for us and exciting for the sport , so it is something i see in a positive light as long as i come out on top next time ! i was the quicker guy in @entity35 , so that was a real positive and i must keep the momentum going and the win will come , so it is all about making the most of the speed we have at the moment			1
second best : @entity33 admits he was ' disappointed ' to finish behind team - mate @entity26 at the @entity35 race coming to @entity106 , i have some great memories here , winning my first @entity18 race two years ago , and the first for the @entity110 in the new era – 57 years after @entity79 ' last victory as a works team			1
it was a special moment that day , and to win my first race was also great			2
i 've had some good races at the @entity117 – it is a track that i enjoy coming to			0
it is a unique track because where we normally destroy the rear tyres , here we destroy the front tyres instead , so you have to adapt completely with a different set - up and knowing what to expect , so it requires a lot of change which is unusual and provides us with a challenge			0
in saying that , i expect us to be the dominating force here because we are very quick at the moment and i do n't expect anybody to close the gap from @entity35 to here			2
i see it as a straight fight between myself and @entity26 for the win in @entity29 , but let 's take it step - by - step			1
this year will be a development race			0
@entity141 is still the benchmark in the sport and they can develop rapidly , but definitely at the moment we are dominating and i am expecting another straight fight with my team - mate this weekend			1
i 've done it : the @entity149 celebrates his first victory in @entity18 at the @entity152 in demand : @entity33 signs autographs for enthusiastic fans at the @entity117 on thursday all smiles : @entity158 's columnist poses for the cameras before being collared by yet more fans in the paddock the long straights come to our advantage in @entity29 ; the @entity79 power unit is the strongest in @entity18 at the moment and the most efficient – mercedes have done an awesome job with that , and our car , too			1
it is looking good aerodynamically and weight wise , we have got the weight under control , so when all of that comes together we have got a great package			0
i am looking forward to the weekend and to keep on maximising what i have and trying to make the most of it because i am here to win and i have a chance to win			0
that really is a big boost , and provides us with great momentum within the team			2
i am proud to be a part of this momentum			0
i have been here since day one – from 2010 – day one of the @entity79 project of the new era – and i have been through the tough times and the struggles , but now we are finally reaping the benefits of all the hard work over the years , the restructuring , all the improvements that we have made as a team – so i have to make the most of it and really enjoy the moment			1
@entity33 's fee for his column will be donated to the @entity203 , which is dedicated to providing help to former and current @entity18 mechanics and their families , putting @entity18 mechanics throughout the world in touch with each other and raising funds to help in times of need			2
you can follow @entity33 on @entity215 @ nico_rosberg and @entity79 @ @entity216 .			2

coming second in @entity35 was disappointing , especially to team - mate @entity26
@entity26 went over the limit at one point in our fight for the lead in @entity35
but that 's racing - it 's behind us and we *'ll* go flat out again in @entity29
it 's great for @entity18 that @entity79 let both its drivers go head - to - head
the winner of @entity29 will be either @entity26 or myself
the @entity79 power unit is the strongest and most efficient in @entity18 at the moment
