she 's often declared her intention to be seen as more than a political wife in a pretty dress but that has n't prevented @entity5 from upping her style game in recent years			1
indeed , mrs @entity5 's most recent appearance in @entity8 saw her cut a stylish figure as she took to the stage , resplendent in a trendy £ 59.99 cerise dress from high street favourite , @entity13			1
true to her independent style , the 44 - year - old 's new look is all her own work , with @entity18 sources keen to point out that she chooses all her own clothes and has resisted calls to get a stylist			0
but while they might look expensive , much of mrs @entity5 's wardrobe comes from carefully chosen high street brands , with @entity13 and @entity37 bulking out a smattering of designer names			2
yesterday saw her take to the stage to defend her ' principled ' husband in a chic emerald green silk shirt and the sort of flattering cropped trousers regularly spotted on @entity46			0
other highlights of her sartorial career so far include the chic £ 245 @entity50 dress and nude @entity53 ' @entity52 ' shoes worn to last year 's @entity18 conference in @entity55 and the stylish geometric - print cigarette pants worn to cast her vote at @entity58 in may			0
stylish : mrs @entity5 has become increasingly stylish since her husband was elected @entity18 leader good look : yesterday , mrs @entity5 opted for an emerald shirt teamed with a pair of flattering cropped trousers show - stoppers : mrs @entity5 in a @entity67 dress ( left ) and in £ 245 @entity50 last year polished : @entity5 's streamlined style also includes plenty of businesslike black and equal amounts of tailoring all business : justine in a pair of printed cropped trousers after casting her vote in the @entity78 elections in may equally well - received was the punchy crimson dress by @entity81 eco-designer @entity67 worn by @entity82 during @entity18 's 2012 @entity8 conference			1
arguably though , it was her stunning @entity86 wedding gown that truly propelled her onto the style scene after years of unflattering black			2
not that she 's immune to the odd slip - up , as the @entity91 style salwar kameez worn to the @entity92 in june made plain			2
but , like fellow political @entity96 ( and reluctant leader 's wife ) , @entity94 , mrs @entity95 has developed a punchy style that rarely looks dated and is always appropriate			0
she might want to be seen as ' more than just a dress ' but the environmental lawyer is doing an excellent job of ensuring her glamorous looks are as talked about as her husband 's speeches - and usually far more positively			0
seeing double : both @entity91 and @entity5 sported unflattering salwar kameez for an event in june not so pretty in print : @entity5 's rare slip - ups include embracing passe paisley and the odd salwar kameez could do better : this frumpy frock ( left ) did nothing for @entity5 's figure and neither did this gingham top ( right ) @entity116 : this nondescript navy shirt and flared jeans combination worn during a trip to @entity120 did her no favours			1

@entity5 , 44 , has become increasingly stylish since 2010
has *swapped* unflattering black for *colourful* dresses and lots of print
*labour* sources say mrs @entity5 's bold new look is all her own work
she has *previously* said she wants to be ' more than just a dress '
despite protests , she has *won* *plaudits* from style *critics* in recent years
still makes *occasional* slip up such as the odd @entity141 salwar kameez
