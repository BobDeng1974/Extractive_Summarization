@entity0 has slammed @entity3 's @entity2 campaign and fears the nation are on a continuous downward spiral			1
@entity7 's men picked up only one point during their three group games in @entity10 , arriving back in @entity3 on wednesday			1
@entity12 chairman @entity11 believes changes to the @entity15 system , allowing more homegrown players to make the step up to first - team football , could help @entity3 win the @entity2 in 2022			1
i fear @entity3 are going the way of the @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31			2
' @entity3 can take some positives			0
@entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 , even though he did n't start the first two games , are a sign of the future - fast , intelligent footballers			0
but otherwise i 'm struggling			0
' @entity0 believes the influx of foreign talent is at the root of the national team 's growing problems			1
' compared to @entity46 and the @entity47 , @entity45 players are not getting enough first - team time in the @entity15 , ' said the @entity50 legend in his @entity52 column			1
critical : former @entity50 midfielder @entity0 has spoken out in his latest @entity52 column bright spark : @entity3 can take some positives from @entity33 and @entity35 , claims @entity57 ' we 're going backwards from 1990 and the era of @entity60 and that conveyor belt of talent			1
simply , the @entity15 is riddled with average foreign players			0
' this is having a detrimental effect on the opportunities for young @entity45 talent and our international results			0
' players as talented as @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 only make the @entity15 stronger			0
but it seems the @entity15 is known as a market for average players ( or their agents ) to say : " i 'll go to @entity3 and they 'll pay me stupid money to play "			2
' @entity0 , meanwhile , has questioned @entity50 's willingness to pay a high price for @entity83 's @entity82			1
@entity0 says : ' the proposed £ 34m transfer for @entity82 to @entity50 is another example of something which has a bad long - term impact			2
clubs are priced out of this market which is why they go abroad for cheap options			0
for a left back to be worth £ 34m shows how silly the game has gone			0
