the unexpected result makes it appear as though the @entity1 is breathing it is an incredible view of our planet ‘ breathing ’ over the course of a year			1
created using images from @entity8 , the incredible animated images give the iconic ‘ blue marble ’ view of the @entity1 a dramatic new twist			1
they were created by @entity13 , a @entity14 programmer for @entity15			1
he stitched together images provided by @entity8 as part of its ‘ @entity21 ’ project , which took a picture of the @entity1 each month			1
‘ it took an afternoon to make , ’ @entity13 told @entity22			1
‘ and then a little bit more for me to describe why i felt the way i did about them - which , to be honest , caught me quite by surprise			0
‘ i of course had some expectation of what i would see as a result of animating these frames			0
‘ but i did n't expect to be so mesmerised by them			0
' the images are based on the original @entity35 , a composite of four months of satellite observations with a spatial resolution ( level of detail ) of 1 square kilometer per pixel created by @entity8			1
@entity13 thanked @entity8 for updating the project for his version			1
' this is made possible by the tremendous folks of the @entity1 team			2
' he also explained how the animations were made			0
he said the idea for the site came following a chat with a colleague about @entity8 ’s website			2
‘ the idea for these images came about rather randomly , as i was describing to a colleague various design options for presenting satellite data in a compelling way			2
an image from @entity8 's @entity60			1
there have been many images of the full disc of @entity1 from space - a view often referred to as ' the @entity35 ' - but few have looked quite like this			1
using natural - colour images from the @entity70 ( @entity70 ) , this shows a new view showing the @entity72 and high latitudes ‘ when went to @entity8 's @entity1 website to access some of their tremendous source data imagery , that they make freely available , i noted that there were images representing @entity1 at each month of the year			1
‘ i was curious if stitching them together in time into an animation would show and interesting seasonal pattern and so i went to work			0
‘ i downloaded the twelve cloud - free satellite imagery mosaics of @entity1 ( " @entity21 " ) at each month of the year			1
i wrapped them into some fun projections then stitched them together into a couple animated gifs			0
’ ‘ because much of the dramatic change throughout the year occurs in the northern latitudes , i chose a polar projection to focus on this area			0
@entity13 said he hoped the images would give people a new view of the planet			2
this image of @entity98 and @entity99 at night is a composite assembled from data acquired by the @entity103 satellite in april and october 2012			0
the new data was mapped over existing @entity35 imagery of @entity1 to provide a realistic view of the planet ‘ overall , to me it looks like breathing , ’ he said			2
‘ my pixel is right at an interesting intersection of life and ice , where the longest night of the year feels like forever , and the longest day of the year is a like a battery strapped to my back			0
‘ when i stitch together what can be an impersonal snapshot of an entire planet , all of the sudden i see a thing with a heartbeat			0
‘ i can track one location throughout a year to compare the annual push and pull of snow and plant life there , while in my periphery i see the oscillating wave of life advancing and retreating , advancing and retreating			0
‘ and i 'm reassured by it			0
’ @entity13 used the visible @entity1 website to access some of their tremendous source data imagery , that they make freely available			1
this ' blue marble ' image is is the most detailed true - colour image of the entire @entity1 to date the images , created by @entity8 , are part of a series called @entity35 : next generation , and give a years worth of monthly composites at a spatial resolution of 500 meters			1
‘ these monthly images reveal seasonal changes to the land surface : the green - up and dying - back of vegetation in temperate regions such as @entity151 and @entity152 , dry and wet seasons in the tropics , and advancing and retreating @entity156 snow cover , ’ said @entity8			2
‘ from a computer processing standpoint , the major improvement is the development of a new technique for allowing the computer to automatically recognise and remove cloud - contaminated or otherwise bad data — a process that was previously done manually			0
‘ the new version also improves image clarity , and gives highly reflective land surfaces , such as salt flats , a more realistic appearance			0

animation was created by @entity13 , a @entity171 programmer for @entity15 solutions
he stitched together @entity8 's satellite images of @entity1 in one afternoon
the unexpected result makes it appear as though the @entity1 is breathing
