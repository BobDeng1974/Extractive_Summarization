by @entity0 world number one @entity1 produced a bogey - free third round 66 to move two shots off the lead at the @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8			1
the @entity9 is in danger of losing his place at the top of the @entity14 after only a week , depending on how @entity15 finishes at the @entity16 at @entity17 , but four birdies helped him to five - under overall to give him a fighting chance going into the final round in @entity8			1
his performance on saturday showed a steady return to form after a disastrous four bogeys on the opening day put him way off the pace			0
not concerned : @entity1 said that he was n't focused on events elsewhere , only on his golf and his performances when asked if the possibility of @entity15 usurping him was a concern , @entity1 told the @entity33 website : ' i can only worry about my golf here			1
worrying about that is n't going to help me at all			0
' it 's all very tight			0
i 'm happy to have gotten to number one			2
i hope it 's not such a short stay			0
' four men are tied leading the way on seven - under overall going into the final @entity45 and @entity46 were the big movers at the top , hitting 64 and 65 respectively , while @entity49 and @entity50 also go into the final day sharing the lead			2
@entity52 heads the chasing pack one shot behind after falling short of being only the seventh player in @entity33 history to shoot 59			1
pressure : @entity15 is ready to benefit from any slip - ups from @entity1 form : after a terrible opening round @entity1 's performances suggested he was getting back to his best six birdies and an eagle after 11 holes made that a possibility at one point , also giving him the overall lead , but the @entity68 was unable to sustain the momentum and finished on 63 for the @entity70 refused to get too downbeat after missing out on the feat , suggesting his luck just ran out slightly on the back nine			1
' i used up a lot of luck today , ' @entity52 told the @entity33 website			1
' i had two chip - ins and made some long putts			0
fifty - nine would have been nice but i kind of lost the feel of the putter there on the back nine			0
all in all , a good day			0
' friday 's leader @entity84 slipped to three - under overall after a disappointing double bogey and two bogies saw him card 74 in the third round			2
close : @entity52 narrowly missed out on a record breaking 59 , eventually finishing with 63			2

@entity9 hits an *improved* round to give himself a chance in the final round
@entity96 number one *responds* to the threat posed by @entity15
@entity1 has only been top of the @entity33 rankings for a week
@entity52 misses out on being *youngest* to hit 59 on @entity33
