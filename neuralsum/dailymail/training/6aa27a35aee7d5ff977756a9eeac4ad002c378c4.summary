self sufficient : five turbines on @entity3 will have an output of 11.5 megawatts - enough power for the island 's 10,000 residents self - sufficiency is a dream for many environmentally - minded people who would like to generate their own electricity			1
and now a whole island is set to become the world ’s first land mass to be fully self - sufficient - by generating its own water and wind power			2
a wind farm will open at the end of june on @entity3 - the smallest of @entity20 ’s @entity19			1
with its steep cliffs and mountains , this location is perfectly positioned to harvest gusts of wind off the @entity27 coast of @entity28			1
its five turbines installed at the north eastern tip of @entity3 , near the capital @entity33 , will have a total output of 11.5 megawatts			1
this is enough power to meet the demand of the island 's 10,000 residents , as well as its water desalination plants			1
although other islands around the world are powered by solar or wind energy , experts say @entity3 is the first to secure a constant supply of electricity by combining wind and water power - and with no connection to any outside electricity network			1
surplus power from the wind turbines will be used to pump fresh water from a reservoir near the harbour to a larger one at volcanic crater located approximately 2,300ft ( 700m ) above sea level			2
when there is little or no wind , the water will be channelled down to the lower reservoir through turbines to generate electricity			1
‘ this system guarantees us a supply of electricity , ’ said the director of the @entity65 wind power plant , @entity66 , who is supervising final tests before the plant starts functioning in a few weeks			2
a world first : @entity3 is set to become the world 's first island to be be fully self - sufficient by generating its own water and wind power			1
a wind farm will open at the end of june , which will make use of the land mass ' geography , with steep cliffs and mountains ( pictured ) a wind farm with five turbines installed at the north eastern tip of @entity3 will open at the end of june			1

‘ this system guarantees us a supply of electricity , ’ said the director of the @entity65 wind power plant , @entity66			0
the plant will account for half of the island 's electricity demand when it is officially inaugurated at the end of june and that figure will rise to 100 per cent over the following months			2
the plant will meet half of the island 's electricity demand when it is officially inaugurated at the end of june - and that figure will rise to 100 per cent over the following months			1
the scheme will cut 18,700 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per year and eliminate the island 's annual consumption of 40,000 barrels of oil			0
however , @entity3 will maintain its fuel oil power station as a backup			0
the island is cited as a pioneering project by @entity131 , the international organisation for renewable energy			0
@entity133 , a climate historian at @entity135 science research institute told @entity136 : ‘ the true novelty of @entity3 is that technicians have managed , without being connected to any national network , to guarantee a stable production of electricity , that comes 100 per cent from renewable energy , overcoming the intermittent nature of the wind			0
’ @entity3 's wind power plant has sparked interest from other islands seeking to follow its example			2
officials from @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 in @entity153 , @entity154 in @entity155 , and @entity156 have all shown interest			0
@entity158 , the president of island 's local council , said : ‘ it is a project which is considered at the world level as a pioneer and it is one of the most important in the production of renewable energy ’			0
the island plans to boost its environmental credentials further by ensuring that by 2020 all of its 6,000 vehicles are run on electricity , based on an agreement with the @entity173			0
going it alone : although other islands around the world are powered by solar or wind energy , experts say @entity3 ( marked ) is the first to secure a constant supply of electricity by combining wind and water power and with no connection to any outside electricity network			1
the island is the smallest of the @entity19 the wind power plant cost € 80million euros ( £ 66million or $ 110million ) to build			2
the island authorities own 60 per cent of the plant , with 30 per cent held by @entity20 energy company @entity190 and 10 per cent by a local technology institute			0
@entity192 continued : ‘ we wanted to be the owners of the majority of the plant			0
that means that the profits as well as the possible losses , that is the destiny of @entity65 , is the responsibility of the residents of the island			0
’ he predicts that revenues from the plant will boost the island 's budget by about € 1million to € 3million per year			0
‘ these are revenues that can go to the local residents , to subsidise water prices , infrastructure , social policies			0
’ the island is already designated a @entity215 by @entity216 , as 60 per cent of the land - around 107 square miles ( 278 square kilometres ) is protected to preserve natural diversity .			0
