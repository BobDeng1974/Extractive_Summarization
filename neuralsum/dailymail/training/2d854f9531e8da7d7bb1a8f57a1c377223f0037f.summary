on any normal day you would be forgiven for raising a speculative eyebrow at scaremongers professing that the sky is caving in			1
but on saturday it really did fall , as many star - gazers were lucky enough to see			2
the first peak of the annual @entity8 meteor shower happened just after midnight , putting on an eye - catching display , visible across the world			1
@entity16 scientists tracked the shower with a network of cameras on earth , the @entity13 and a research balloon as they attempted to capture the display in @entity22 for the first time			1
@entity39 , @entity16 's @entity40 at the agency 's @entity41 in @entity43 , @entity44 , told @entity45 : ‘ the moon messes a lot of stuff			2
i like the moon … but it can keep us from getting work done			2
’ technology : a ' @entity53 ' @entity52 app was created to allow members of the public to join in , counting the number of meteors and sending the data to @entity16 at its fiercest there were between 15 and 20 meteors every hour			2
a ‘ @entity53 ’ @entity52 app was created to allow members of the public to join in , counting the number of meteors and sending the data to @entity16			0
in past years rate has reached heights of 100 - per - hour but @entity39 warned wannabe - astrologers not to set their hopes to high and expect to see just a handful each hour			0
in some areas the @entity8 were seen as well as heard			0
a loud explosion , likely caused by a meteor , was heard across @entity75 and @entity76 at around 8am on sunday morning , rattling windows and shaking houses			1
excited witnesses said they saw a fireball streak across the sky at the same time and experts said the reports indicated the meteor broke up somewhere over the @entity86 southwest of @entity87			1
for those plagued by local cloud cover , unable to see the show themselves			2
@entity39 hosted a ‘ @entity16 up all night ’ webchat to discuss the @entity8 in real - time and there is a second chance to see it			0
tonight the shower is set to happen again , with its best display running from 11pm to 5am			1
the lyrids occur every year as a result of the @entity99 passing through debris left by @entity101 , and the shower has been occurring for at least 2600 years			1
specks of @entity101 ’s dust hit the top of earth ’s atmosphere at 110,000 mph and disintegrate in a flurry of meteors , enjoyed by spectators worldwide			0
the actual comet is far from earth at the moment – orbiting the sun once every 415 years – but debris from it has spread out along its path , mostly pieces of dust or rock smaller than grains of sand			0
as the meteors push through the atmosphere they burn up 50 to 70 miles above the ground , producing a vivid display of light			1
meteors best seen in places away from light pollution			0
lyrids are typically about as bright as the stars of the @entity132 , making them relatively easy to spot for the novice gazer			0
giving advice to amateurs , @entity39 said : ' the last thing you want to do is look at @entity138 , which is the direction of the radiant , because the meteors in that direction have very short tails and will appear as a dot to you			0
' the best thing to do with any meteor shower is to go out there , lie on your back and look straight up			1

in @entity75 and @entity76 *astronomers* said an *exploding* meteor caused windows to rattle and houses to shake
every year the meteor shower puts on a vivid display
a darker sky thanks to a new moon made the show even more impressive
