as @entity3 fever has gripped the world over the past fortnight , here at @entity1 we have come up with our own set of accolades in the @entity3 spirit			1
including stellar performances from @entity13 on the touchline , @entity9 and his long - ball dossier and @entity11 trying to speak @entity15 , to name but a few , we have looked back over the season so far and come up with the best displays in football			1
and the winner is … @entity13 pushes @entity22 in the chest during @entity25 's 2 - 0 win against @entity26 last year best technical area tantrum : @entity13 the clash was more akin to outside a boozer after a heavy saturday night than on the touchline in one of the biggest fixtures of the calendar			1
a furious @entity13 stunned everyone when he stormed over and shoved @entity22 in the @entity36 technical area during the first half of @entity26 ’ s defeat against @entity25 earlier in the season			1
it was like years of pent - up rage had finally burst out of the usually serene @entity42			2
fourth official @entity43 acted as the bouncer and had to step in - between them as the pair squared up to each other			2
fourth official @entity43 acted as the bouncer and had to step in - between the pair best press conference rant : @entity9 you could barely have made it up if you tried			1
@entity53 manager @entity9 had his ego pricked by @entity56 boss @entity55 accusing his team of long - ball tactics and responded by arriving at his next press conference armed with a small dossier complete with pages of blue and red allows explaining why his team , in fact , did not simply lump the ball up the pitch now			1
it evoked memories of @entity71 ’s infamous ‘ facts ’ rant at then - @entity53 manager sir @entity73 in 2009			1
the reaction of the @entity53 press officer as she grimaced after handing out the sheets of paper was priceless			2
@entity9 brandishes his dossier as he attempts to prove that @entity53 are not a long ball side @entity9 produced a dossier full of stats in a lively press conference after @entity55 's ' long - ball ' jibe @entity9 looks unimpressed as the @entity85 tells a packed press conference about his tactics best foreign - language film : @entity11 this was fantastically cringeworthy			1
@entity11 , newly - appointed as @entity91 manager , was asked about his knowledge of their reserve team in a press conference			1
@entity11 had been in @entity96 for little less than a month and had clearly picked up a bit of the lingo			2
‘ i know the @entity99 , i know some of the players , ’ he replied			0
‘ they have been training with me … uno , dos , tres , cuatro … umm … times … but i ’ve not seen them play			0
’ it ’s hard not to watch the video over and over again once you have seen it for the first time			0
@entity11 was widely mocked for it , but hats off for giving the language a go			0
@entity11 attempted a bit of @entity15 during his @entity91 press conference the @entity91 boss said , ' they ( b team ) have been training with me uno , dos , tres , cuatro times ' best comment : @entity123 the chemistry between @entity1 ’s @entity125 and @entity123 on @entity126 was dynamite from the start			1
in their first show together , @entity123 was explaining how hard it is to mark @entity131 by comparing him to a burglar in your house who you ca n’t find			0
‘ that ’s the big problem for centre - backs , ’ @entity123 said			2
‘ he ’s a bit like a burglar in your house you do n’t know which room he ’s in			0
’ @entity125 hit back with : ‘ you ’d be under the bed			0
’ before @entity123 floors him by replying : ‘ you ’d probably be the burglar			0
’ @entity125 almost choked on his water			0
@entity125 ( left ) and @entity123 have provided several brilliant moments on @entity126 best swan dive : @entity150 ‘ it ’s like something out of @entity157 , ’ was opposition manager @entity152 ’s take on @entity150 ’s theatrical dive against @entity154			2
in @entity25 ’s 2 - 0 win back in december @entity150 , already on a yellow card , flicked the ball between @entity161 and @entity162 then followed it through , legs spreadeagled and arms flailing			1
there was clearly no contact from the @entity154 players			0
referee @entity168 did not give a penalty but also failed to book the player			0
@entity150 goes down theatrically in the box for @entity25 during a 2 - 0 win against @entity154 in december the @entity25 defender was also on a yellow card and risked getting sent off @entity168 ( second right ) points for a goal kick and wrongly failed to produce a second yellow for @entity150 best supporting actor : @entity180 as @entity25 have lead the way out - front at the top of the @entity184 table everyone ’s been talking about @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191			1
but it is @entity180 who has been lurking in the shadows , pulling the strings for the side			1
they ’ve only lost one game out of 37 with him in the side , and two out of three without			0
it is for this statistic alone that he deserves the best supporting actor award			1
@entity25 midfielder @entity180 has been one of the star players at @entity36 this season the @entity205 's tough - tackling in front of the @entity25 defence has been key for @entity22 this season achievement in make - up and hairstyling : @entity211 @entity212 voted @entity56 ’s @entity211 the 10th worst - dressed man of 2014			1
the midfielder has a sensational wardrobe			0
top hats , sunglasses , pink trainers , full yellow tracksuits , boots , ties , denim dungarees , long sleeves , short sleeves , no sleeves			0
he likes accessories and short hair and long hair and dyed hair			0
it really is hard to keep up with his changing fashions and unusual tastes on a daily basis			0
@entity235 enforcer @entity211 was the obvious choice for @entity1 's style award @entity211 's @entity239 account is awash with pictures of him dressed in some alternative outfits			2
