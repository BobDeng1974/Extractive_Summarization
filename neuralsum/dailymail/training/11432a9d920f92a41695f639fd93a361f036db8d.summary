@entity1 showers could become a thing of the past , if a new beauty trend called ' cleansing reduction ' takes off			1
instead of bathing every day , proponents whittle their washing habits down to once or twice a week on the grounds that too much cleansing can strip the skin and hair of essential natural oils			1
while it might sound disgusting , it would seem that cleansing reduction is catching on , after a poll for tissue manufacturer , @entity16 , found that 41 per cent of @entity18 men and 33 per cent of women no longer shower every day			1
shower optional ? 41 per cent of @entity18 men do n't wash every day according to a poll by tissue company , @entity16 the poll also revealed that a filthy 12 per cent said that they indulge in a ' proper wash ' just once a week			1
it is the younger generation who are leading the trend for joining the great unwashed , with 37 per cent of teenagers admitting to taking a ' shower in a can ' - that 's a quick spritz of deodorant to you and me - on a regular basis , according to market analysts , @entity39			0
an @entity41 blog on the subject also attracted some illuminating responses , including one committed soap dodger , who revealed that they washed only ' when dirty , sweaty or smelly , so if i 've been gardening or out for a vigorous bike ride , or if it 's just very hot weather			2
' disgusting as it might sound , going for long periods without bathing is nothing new , according to @entity54 sociologist , dr @entity53			0
according to @entity56 , daily showers are a relatively recent development and less than a century ago , a weekly bath would have been considered perfectly adequate			2
' now we think nothing of showering once , twice or even three times a day , before and after work or going out and after the gym , ' she said in an interview with the @entity66			2
' it has embedded itself in our routine and become an essential , not an optional , thing to do			0
' soap dodgers : both @entity71 and @entity72 are said to prefer using dry , rather than liquid , shampoo popular : @entity76 's dry shampoo , Â£ 1.49 , has become a festival season essential and is a life saver for travellers while dermatologists worry about the impact all the washing could have on your skin , green campaigners have long argued that reducing the amount of time we spend in the shower would benefit the environment			1
@entity91 , an @entity92 dedicated to reducing water consumption in the @entity18 , argues that having fewer or shorter showers ' will use less water and less energy ' and will also ' reduce your carbon footprint , which helps prevent global warming			1
' its long - running ' @entity102 ' campaign has attracted some celebrity supporters too , most notably the former children 's tv presenter , @entity104			0
but while preserving the environment is driving the soap - free trend for some , for many more , it 's simply because they 're too lazy to get up early for a wash			2
a survey by the @entity113 last year found that 58 per cent of @entity18 men regularly miss their morning shower because they are too idle or too rushed			2
likewise , sales of time - saving products such as dry shampoo have soared , with @entity119 reporting a 37 per cent rise in sales			0
what 's more , they add , one in five products are bought by men - possibly including @entity71 who once revealed that he had n't washed his hair for two years			1
clean ? prince @entity71 arrives at @entity128 for the coronation celebrations - hopefully after a shower with some hairdressers arguing that too much washing strips hair of sebum , resulting in a lank and greasy look , it would seem that he - and fellow dry shampoo addict , @entity72 - might be on to something			1
interestingly , a study conducted by the @entity140 found that too much washing can actually be bad for you , because it strips away beneficial bugs that the body uses to help ward off infections			0
' a vigorous daily shower would disturb the natural bug flora of the skin as well as skin oils , ' revealed @entity150 , professor of virology at @entity153 's @entity152 and @entity154			0
nevertheless , @entity155 told the @entity66 that he was concerned by a study released by the @entity113 that found nearly half of the population wash their hands less than five times a day , saying it means our hands carry ' as many germs as a toilet bowl '			1
but despite his dim view of sink - dodgers , @entity155 still does n't think we need to shower as much as we do			0
' as long as people wash their hands often enough and pay attention to the area of the body below the belt , showering or bathing every other day would do no harm			1
' even twice a week would not be a problem if people used a bidet daily as most infectious bugs hang around our lower halves			2
' we pay too much attention to the body beautiful and smelling good , with perfumes for men and women , ' he added			0
' we should wash to stop cross-infection , not for grooming reasons			0

' cleansing reduction ' means reducing showers to once or twice a week
benefits can include keeping good bugs which help fight *disease* intact
although showering less is fine , you need to regularly wash your hands
