investors have been treated to a @entity2 bonus after more than £ 105billion was added to the value of @entity5 ’s biggest companies in little over a week			2
the @entity6 gained another 21.44 points yesterday to close at 6598.18			2
but it was not all good news as the pound fell against the @entity12 dollar , making holidays stateside more expensive for @entity5 travellers			1
investors have been treated to a @entity2 bonus after more than £ 105billion was added to the value of @entity5 ’s biggest companies in little over a week ( file picture ) the @entity6 has now jumped more than 400 points , or 6.7 per cent , in the last six trading sessions , adding £ 105.6billion to the value of blue - chip firms since early last week			1
the so - called ‘ @entity30 ’ , when the stock prices surge in the festive period , is good news for investors and workers saving for a pension who have money tied up in the markets			1
however , the @entity6 is still below the 6743 it reached early this month before tumbling oil prices , the crisis in @entity34 , and fears over the eurozone sent it crashing to a year low			1
@entity38 fell below $ 1.55 against a resurgent @entity12 dollar for the first time since august last year – a development that will make @entity2 trips to @entity12 more expensive for @entity5 travellers			1
meanwhile stock markets in @entity12 soared to record highs last night as ‘ astounding ’ figures showed the @entity12 economy growing at its fastest pace for 11 years			1
on @entity50 , the @entity49 smashed through the 18,000 mark for the first time			0
in contrast , there were signs that the @entity5 economy is slowing as the year comes to an end			0
figures from the @entity59 showed gross domestic product – the total size of the economy – rose by a healthy 0.7 per cent between july and september			0
the surge is good news for investors and workers saving for a pension who have money tied up in the markets ( file picture ) but that was lower than the 0.8 per cent growth seen in the second quarter of the year			1
output was only 2.6 per cent higher than in the same period of last year , far less than the 3 per cent increase previously reported			0
the @entity59 report also showed the economy grew by less than expected in the previous five quarters meaning the recovery since early last year was weaker than thought			0
@entity80 , chief economist at the @entity81 , said : ‘ the stark revision in annual growth confirms that the pace of recovery is slowing			0
’ but analysts said the recent slump in the price of oil – a drop from $ 115 a barrel in june to below $ 60 last night – will breathe new life into the economy in 2015 as tumbling petrol prices leave households with more money to spend			1
former @entity98 economist @entity97 , now at @entity99 , said : ‘ the oil price rout is like a big tax cut for consumers , and @entity5 consumers tend to spend extra income			0
‘ in our view , now is the time to be optimistic about the @entity5			0
a tax cut funded by @entity34 and the @entity109 and falling mortgage rates should combine in a powerful cocktail that boosts @entity5 growth next year			2
’ @entity113 , senior economic adviser to the @entity114 , said : ‘ looking ahead to 2015 the @entity5 may experience some softening in growth			0
‘ however , the plunge in oil prices promises to provide the economy with renewed momentum , by improving household purchasing power and boosting global growth			1
‘ overall , the chance that growth in output in 2015 could outpace 2014 ’s expansion can not be ruled out			0
’ in the @entity12 , official figures showed the @entity12 economy grew at an annual rate of 5 per cent in the third quarter of the year – its best performance for 11 years .			2

surge is good for investors and pension savers with money in the markets
jumped 6.7 *%* in last six trading sessions , adding value to blue - chip firms
@entity6 still below the 6743 high prior to tumbling oil prices and @entity34 crisis
