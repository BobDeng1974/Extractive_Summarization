by @entity0 ah , the glorious hint of summer , the softness of the breeze , the winter grump giving way to lightness , but — ugh — the clothes ! few things can dull the mood of a older lady like a sweep around the shops as autumn / winter ’s woollens give way to pastel atrocities and , horror of horror , sleeveless shifts			1
at 54 , my arms pay no heed to twice - weekly @entity23 classes or 40 lengths of the pool			1
so stubborn are those pockets of fat that the number of surgical ‘ arm lifts ’ carried out in @entity30 increased by 97 per cent from 2009 to @entity31 i prefer to rely on the perfect summer sleeve , revealing just the right amount of skin			1
at last , the @entity35 is taking notice , and there are more spring dresses with sleeves than ever			1
i checked out what ’s available			1
denim shirt dress , £ 30 , next.co.uk , heels , £ 29 , dorothyperkins.com my initial reaction to this was ‘ @entity44 ’			1
i do wear denim quite a bit but this looked a lot younger than what i would usually attempt			1
however , i was quite pleasantly surprised that with a few tweaks — rolling up the long sleeves and tying the belt tightly around my waist — and a nude pair of heels , it actually looked nice			2
not an outfit for an expensive lunch , perhaps , but nice for a potter around the shops or a picnic			2
bright pumps are a must , though			2
score : 3/5 @entity66 lace sleeve dress , £ 295 , johnlewis.com			1
heels , £ 195 , lucychoilondon.com this flattering soft pink made my skin look tanned and felt really modern and fresh			1
the delicate , elbow - length lace gave a tantalising glimpse of flesh without being too revealing and made my arms appear slimmer			2
the dress skimmed over my hips and was comfortable both sitting and standing			2
i intend to wear this again as it ’s sexy without being overdone and incredibly comfortable to wear			2
score : 5/5 floral print dress , £ 95 , @entity80 - stores.com , @entity67 , £ 198 , lucychoilondon.com i am really not a floral person — i do n’t have a single floral item in my wardrobe — but this i really loved			1
it ’s perfectly cut , managing to simultaneously fit like a glove while also having plenty of give , so you do n’t feel like you ’re sewn in			0
the elbow - length sleeves make my arms looks slim and trim			0
in fact , i like it so much i ’m going to wear it to a swanky lunch party			0
score : 4/5 @entity97 maxi , £ 120 , @entity98 , heels , £ 60 , office.co.uk a lovely evening look with three - quarter - length lace sleeves which were neither heavy nor scratchy			1
although very fitted , the gentle gathering across the stomach cut a flattering shape , and navy was a nice change from funereal black			0
lace sleeves are the perfect answer to summer dressing , especially for over- 50s			0
@entity64 : 3.5/5 expensive but @entity109 it goat belted dress , £ 450 , @entity113 : 0207 629 9161 , heels , £ 195 , lucychoillondon.com i loved the pleating around the bust , while the belt nipped in at just the right point			1
the sleeves were a lovely length and the hem was cut for an elegant silhouette			0
i would n’t usually go for white in a dress as it can be very unflattering , but i was pleasantly surprised			0
yes , it is expensive but it looks — and feels — it too			0
would look even better with a light tan at a garden party			0
score : 4/5 embellished midi dress , £ 399 , @entity132 , heels , £ 69 , dune.co.uk oh gosh			1
not my cup of tea at all			0
the length made me feel dumpy and , as it was difficult to walk in , i felt incredibly inelegant			0
the sleeves were cut at an unflattering length and were too unfitted , while the chainmail overlay was far too heavy			0
even bare arms would be better			0
i do n’t see myself wearing this any time soon and certainly not at that cost			0

ranging from £ 30 to £ 450 , @entity0 looks at the @entity144 dresses that reveal just the right amount of skin
