after two triumphant trips to @entity4 in 2014 and promotion to the @entity6 after a nine - year exile , @entity1 chairman @entity0 had fixed his hopes for the @entity8 on something a little more mundane			1
he would settle for a solid season in @entity11 with perhaps a small sign of progress in the quest to build a new stadium			2
then they were drawn at home to @entity18 and @entity0 , like many fellow @entity1 fans , spent the day in a daze , snuggling into the warm embrace of the @entity21 , a competition which in its modern guise promises financial reassurances besides the traditional romance			1
@entity1 players celebrate @entity28 success at @entity4 last season @entity1 manager @entity30 ( left ) and @entity0 ( right ) celebrate the club 's promotion at @entity4 ' last year was incredible , ' said @entity0			1
' to be sat in the @entity33 at @entity4 twice last year , felt good			1
it 's only a couple of years since we were losing £ 25,000 - £ 30,000 a month , and we 've come through it all on a reasonably stable footing			1
' we thought 2015 might be a time for consolidation , nothing too spectacular			2
then , we 're drawn against one of the top club teams in the world			2
' @entity0 was in the @entity44 studios , on monday , along with manager @entity30 , previous chairman @entity46 and director @entity47 for the fourth - round draw			1
they were the third team out of the hat			0
' i do n't think we saw the rest of it , ' he admitted			0
three television crews descended on the @entity57 and the phones went wild with ticket enquiries			0
the tie is certain to be the @entity44 's first pick for live broadcast , which guarantees @entity63 a windfall from the @entity21 of £ 234,000 in prize money and television payments			1
it is an incredible boost for a club with a wage bill of £ 1.25m per year - roughly what @entity70 earns in five weeks - and which has teetered often on the brink of extinction during a decade of turmoil			1
the @entity57 - the home of @entity11 side @entity1 @entity70 looks on during @entity18 's third round @entity21 win at @entity77 on sunday @entity1 boss @entity78 will be the latest of a number of high - profile visitors to the @entity57 @entity82 's live third - round tie against @entity83 on monday drew a @entity44 audience of 6.5million , @entity18 , at @entity77 on sunday , drew 1.3m on @entity85			1
this tie will remind the world that @entity1 is alive and kicking – and that is largely thanks to its fans			1
the club has always led an up - and - down existence			2
elected to the @entity6 in 1970 , they went up to the second tier with help from @entity96 and back to the fourth before @entity97 took them to the brink of the @entity100 in its inaugural season			1
@entity63 reached the @entity21 quarter - finals twice , in 1990 and 1991 , and finished fifth in @entity103 in 1992			1
they were six points from automatic promotion and were beaten in the play - offs by @entity107			2
this proved to be the high watermark before a steady decline turned serious soon after the turn of the millennium			0
in 2005 , @entity63 were relegated from the @entity6 and forced to sell the @entity57 as they were plunged into administration			2
the view of the terrace at the @entity57 which will be packed to the rafters the tunnel where the @entity63 and @entity18 players will line up prior to the @entity21 fourth round the sale of the ground for £ 1.92m to director @entity123 and his business partner @entity124 saved the club in the short term but would haunt it for years			1
rent bills had a crippling impact on finances and a bitter struggle erupted inside the club until @entity123 sold the ground to the current landlords @entity133 for £ 3.5m			2
@entity47 was among those who made sacrifices to save the club			0
the 76 - year - old , a fan for more than 70 years , sold his entire collection of memorabilia – programmes , shirts and autographs dating back to 1947 and valued at more than £ 35,000 - for £ 10,000 to raise instant cash , and gave every penny to the club 's administrators			1
@entity147 is set for a reunion with his former side @entity18 in the @entity21 fourth round money holds aloft the @entity28 after @entity1 's win against @entity152 at @entity4 last march ' we were in a position where we needed £ 10,000 , just to get through the weekend , ' he said			1
' we 've been close to the edge many times			0
we 've suffered and without the loyal supporters who have stood shoulder to shoulder , this fantastic club would n't be here			0
there would be houses here instead			0
' @entity0 has put megabucks in			0
so did his predecessor @entity46			0
these people have put their hands in their pockets			0
' fans pitched in with volunteer work : manning tea bars , answering phones , selling tickets and tending the pitch to keep it going and the @entity173 have grown to play an influential role during the recovery years			0
@entity150 took over as manager in 2012 , replacing @entity177 , a former youth team coach , who had stepped up when the club could n't afford to appoint anyone else			0
he was in charge for nearly two years and is now the director of football			0
@entity1 clinched promotion to @entity11 via the play - offs and also won the @entity28 last year , but the visit of @entity18 will eclipse that , certainly in terms of exposure			1
' i feel like a 30 - year - old again , ' said @entity47			2
' i took a call at 3.30am from a friend in the @entity192 who forgot the time difference but had heard about the draw			0
i could n't get back to sleep and i 've spent the whole day at the club			0
it 's been full of people after tickets that do n't go on sale until monday			2
' first though , to @entity201 this saturday , for something a little more mundane .			0
