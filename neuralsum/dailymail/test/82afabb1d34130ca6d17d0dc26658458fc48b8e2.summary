the most popular cities in the world are often instantly recognisable thanks to their world - famous landmarks			1
but what would these cities look like if they did not have their prized attractions ? that 's what one studio asked its designers , and the images it received back were certainly illuminating			1
nearly 100 submissions have been created , with a number of them focusing on the 300m - high @entity15 in their creations the startling absence of the giant tower left the landscape feeling bare and flat , although it did allow for views from the @entity51 , through to the @entity21			1
more missing features in @entity16 included the impressive @entity24			1
instead of leading to the famous centrepiece , the multiple surrounding roads meet at a bare , round circle			2
without the @entity57 to draw boats of tourists , @entity56 looks forlorn and barren			2
all that remains of the island is the paved stone where the iconic colossal neoclassical sculpture stood			0
the @entity57 draws boats of tourists every day , but without the iconic lady , @entity56 looks nothing special @entity67 is a medieval church in @entity69 , @entity70 that has been around since 1215			0
its spires and towers peek over the city the @entity75 looks just like any other river with the elegant @entity77 stretching across the waterway the iconic @entity77 is featured in nearly every @entity80 tourist shop and often mistakenly referred to by visitors as @entity82 designers imaged what @entity80 would look like without its most photographed clocktower and @entity86 the @entity86 is more commonly known as the @entity86 , with both the @entity87 and @entity88 based in the @entity90 - style waterfront building @entity80 's attractions draw millions of tourists every year , but there would be a lot less photographs taken in the city if @entity97 was not a feature on the skyline			1
it is said to be the most photographed clock in the world , and would not be easy to remove , sitting at over 13 tons			0
the sunset skyline looks empty without the impressive architecture of the @entity86			0
the banks of @entity106 , in @entity107 , look desolate with the majestic presence of the @entity109 the @entity109 is a striking white marble mausoleum in @entity107 , and brings millions of tourists to the surrounding area a certain @entity114 presence is missing from the skyline of @entity116 , making the normally instantly - recognisable city a little more mysterious @entity119 the redeemer overlooks all the goings on in @entity116 , and makes the city instantly recognisable the @entity121 stands out due to its uniquely designed opera house , which resembles the sails of a ship , without it the skyline looks like any other cluster of skyscrapers the beautiful monastery carved out of red rock in @entity131 , @entity132 , was originally part of a @entity134 the rose - red @entity131 is @entity132 's most prized tourist attraction , and hopefully , being a @entity136 , will never disappear @entity137 was only rediscovered by western travellers in 1911 , leading to the site being excavated and becoming a tourist attraction the ruins at the @entity143 settlement of @entity137 in @entity144 have made the area a bucket list favourite @entity148 without the falls is a dry , barren hole , and would not attract the 12 million annual visitors it does today on the border of the @entity155 and @entity156 , @entity153 is actually made up of three separate waterfalls the designs also featured landmarks outside of typical city backdrops			1
without the tumbling 51 - metre - high @entity153 , the area left behind would not pull the 12 million annual visitors that it sees every year			2
while the @entity164 are an incredible sight by themselves , iconic pictures with the ruins at the @entity143 settlement of @entity137 , have made the area a bucket list favourite			0
standing at 68m , the @entity167 would be missed from the urban landscape behind if it were removed the @entity169 of late presidents on @entity171 have vanished , leaving behind just another normal rockface @entity171 would be unrecognisable without the presidential presence which has been in place since the carvings were completed between 1934 and 1939			0
