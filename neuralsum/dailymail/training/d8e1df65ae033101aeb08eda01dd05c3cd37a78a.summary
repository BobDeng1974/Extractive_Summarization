@entity0 has assured @entity2 supporters the goals will soon start to come for him at the @entity4 but admitted he needs to start acting on instinct in front of goal			1
in an interview with @entity11 the former @entity9 striker also tipped @entity12 to become a top manager after he retires , @entity14 to become the best player in the world , and opens up about telling his four - year - old daughter why he could not play football when he first joined the club			1
' we have got the best player in the world in @entity22 [ @entity23 ] and the player who is going to be the best player in the world in the future in @entity14 , ' said @entity0 who has so far been king of the assists in @entity2 's front three with five passes to goal but only one goal			1
@entity0 looks on with frustration after going close to scoring for @entity2 against @entity33 on sunday on the subject of scoring he said : ' i got annoyed with myself for the first miss [ against @entity33 ] there was a doubt in the finish , i changed my mind just as i was going to hit it			1
it was a good job we won because i would have felt even worse			1
then i scored a perfectly good goal that was wrongly ruled out for offside			1
' i have to get back to just going with my instinct			2
i had a chance in @entity48 in the @entity49 [ against @entity50 ] when @entity22 set me up and i had the far post to aim for but i wanted to make absolutely sure and tried to hit it hard			2
i have to forget myself a bit and just go with instinct			0
' @entity2 are currently two points behind @entity56 in the table having lost the @entity58 last month			1
' we know it is going to be difficult because @entity56 are very strong but they can slip at any time as we have slipped in the past , that happens in football			0
we have to keep getting better game by game and we know the obligation is to win , ' he said			0
@entity0 celebrates with his team - mates after their last victory over @entity33 in @entity70 on sunday evening and on the pressures of living up to the @entity73 reputation he joined from @entity9 with he added : ' i know i 've come here to score goals but all the time the team is doing well and i feel that i 'm helping the team then i 'm going to be very happy			1
' if the team starts doing badly and i 'm not scoring then i will have to face the criticism but while the team is winning and i 'm helping then it 's fine			0
i want to help with goals , of course i do , but we also have two other phenomenal strikers who score a lot of goals so it is not a drama			1
' despite hitting it off with @entity14 and @entity23 , it is @entity12 who @entity0 has spent the most time with since joining , having moved into the same @entity93 neighbourhood on the @entity94			1
and he has tipped the @entity95 to go on to become a top manager when he retires			0
he told @entity11 : ' he is going to be a wonderful coach			0
he is very intelligent and he sees the game so well			0
i love him as a player and he 'd be someone who i would always want to have on my side			2
he 's clever , he 's a leader but he also is great team - player			2
and you put him anywhere on the pitch and he will deliver			0
' the former @entity9 star has only scored one goal for @entity2 since his arrival in the summer @entity0 celebrates his first goal for @entity2 against @entity50 in the @entity49 last week asked about the disciplinary problems that have plagued his career he said : ' now i am trying to argue less with rival players			1
i 'm not going to stop fighting for the ball but i 'm trying not to fall into the trap of getting involved with defenders because i know i could come off worse because of things that have happened in the past			0
' the @entity115 also opened up on how he told his daughter why he was not initially playing at @entity2			1
' she is four - years - old but she takes everything in and it hurt me a lot when she started asking why i was n't playing , ' he said			0
' at first i would say that it was because of my knee injury			0
but when we played @entity124 and i was at home watching the game and she asked me why i was not playing			0
i said : '' @entity128 made a mistake and they have shown him a red card ''			0
and she said '' okay ! '' and that was it			0
there were still a couple more games to play but she never asked me about it again			2
' now she is happy that i 'm playing and she knows all the players ' names which surprises me a lot			0
i called her the morning after i scored my first goal in @entity48 against @entity50 and she said : '' you scored a goal @entity128 and @entity22 scored two ''			1
i said to her : '' no , @entity22 scored three '' and she said : '' i only saw two , i fell asleep after that ''			2
so she is keeping an eye on who is scoring the goals			2
' @entity0 has performed well for @entity2 thus far with five assists but promises the goals will come soon			1
