@entity1 justice : @entity2 instantly expelled two radical islamists from @entity4 two radical islamists were kicked out of @entity4 yesterday – prompting calls for @entity6 to take the same no - nonsense approach when it comes to removing extremists			1
@entity2 demanded the deportation of a convicted terrorist and a hate preacher			1
no sooner had the expulsion order been signed than the pair were put on flights out of the country			1
the swift departures led to comparisons with @entity20 ’s embarrassingly flawed efforts to remove hate preacher @entity21 who is wanted in @entity22 on terror charges			1
he is out on bail after the @entity26 blocked his deportation on the grounds that @entity29 would not face a fair trial if returned			0
home secretary mrs may has insisted she wants to secure an agreement with @entity22 which would satisfy the @entity35 court and allow @entity29 to be removed from @entity20			1
despite this however , officials insist any attempt to remove him in breach of the court ’s ruling would be met with a court injunction by his lawyers			1
@entity4 law allows swift removal of foreigners , with around 20,000 non-eu nationals being expelled every year			1
unlike in @entity20 , where cases can drag on for years , rights of appeal are strictly curtailed			1
in this country , ministers wait until a subject ’s legal options are exhausted before removing them from the country			0
this can include a lengthy appeal to the @entity26			0
but in @entity4 , @entity61 and other @entity63 countries , terror suspects have been removed even if legal proceedings are still going on , or even in breach of a @entity35 ruling			1
@entity4 security forces arrest @entity67 , the leader of the @entity70 @entity69 radical group , after searching his house in @entity72 , western @entity4 last week terrorist : the crackdown in @entity4 was prompted by the killings of seven people , including three children , by @entity78 inspired gunman @entity79 ( pictured ) last month mr @entity2 , who is behind in the polls going into this month ’s presidential election , said : ‘ those who make remarks contrary to the values of the @entity85 will be put outside the @entity4			1
there will be no exceptions			0
’ @entity88 , an imam , was sent back to @entity89 for ‘ preaching anti-semitism ’ and calling on women to wear the full veil , which is illegal in @entity4			1
@entity93 , an @entity94 convicted for his role in a 1994 terror attack in @entity97 that killed 14 people , was flown to @entity99 after the authorities discovered he had resumed contact with @entity69 activists			0
another man , @entity103 , a @entity104 imam , was barred from returning to @entity4			2
last night @entity106 mp for @entity107 said : ‘ it would be nice if we adopted the same approach in this country			0
‘ i ’m sure this is n’t disconnected to the forthcoming presidential elections in @entity4			2
this is what irritates the public about politicians – they take these actions before the election and once voting ends , normal service resumes			0
‘ i think the @entity20 public want to see these people deported			2
’ comparisons : the untouchable @entity21 ( left ) , who is wanted on @entity22 on terror charges , and @entity88 ( right ) , who was sent back to @entity89 the row comes ahead of a key ruling by the @entity35 court over the extradition of hook - handed extremist @entity130			1
he is wanted for terror offences in the @entity133 but has argued that sending him for trial would breach his human rights			2
a decision on his case and that of five other terror suspects will be delivered next tuesday			0
@entity140 , mp for @entity141 , added : ‘ the fact seems to be that we can throw out @entity21 and others like him if we want to			2
it ’s just a question of will in @entity148			0
’ on monday a senior judge expressed his astonishment that an @entity94 terrorist who was thrown out of @entity4 is now living in @entity20			1
the 49 - year - old was convicted of a 1992 airport bomb attack in his country			0
he lived in @entity4 where he was jailed for membership of a terrorist group and ordered to be deported			2
in 2001 he came to @entity20 and since then has been fighting to claim asylum in the @entity20			0
the @entity158 ruled in his favour			0
the crackdown in @entity4 follows the killings of seven people last month by @entity78 - inspired gunman @entity79			0
the victims included three @entity165 schoolchildren .			0

two radical islamists have already been put on flights out of @entity4 within hours of @entity2 *'s* expulsion order
@entity20 officials , meanwhile , continue with their battle to remove hate preacher @entity21 , who is wanted in @entity22 on terror charges
