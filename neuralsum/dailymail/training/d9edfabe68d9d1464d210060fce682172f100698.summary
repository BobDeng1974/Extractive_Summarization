by @entity0 passengers on board a @entity4 flight to @entity5 were encouraged to play a ' rowdy toilet roll throwing game ' to win free booze , according to a holidaymaker			1
cabin crew allegedly split rows of people into two teams and told to hurl the rolls as far as they could in order to claim alcohol - hitting other passengers in the face in the process			1
the 20 - minute game took place on board a flight from @entity23 to @entity5 , on which elderly holidaymakers were travelling			1
rows of passengers were divided into two teams by a male member of the cabin crew and played six or seven rounds in a desperate bid to win a ' free bar '			1
mr @entity37 said : ' i was sitting in my seat minding my own business when this blaring voice said whichever team managed to get a toilet roll to the back of a plane first won			1
free booze game : passengers were promised alcohol if they won the game on board a @entity4 flight to @entity23 ' the prize was a free bar which meant free alcoholic drinks to a flight full of lads and holidaymakers			1
' but there were elderly people on board who just wanted quiet			0
' there were all these hands in the air flailing wildly as this bundle , which was quite heavy , made its way to down the aisles to the back of the plane			0
' i was n't playing the game and the toilet roll hit me and a poor pensioner who was nodding off when the roll bashed into her face			1
' after the game finished , cabin crew admitted that there was no free alcohol on board flight 4332			1
on board brawl : last month , a hen party was involved in a fight on board a @entity4 flight to @entity99 mr @entity37 added : ' the clown who worked for @entity4 said he was just joking after all that nonsense			2
' he is planning to complain to @entity4 because of their ' unprofessionalism and disregard for the well - being of its passengers '			0
it comes after last month , bride - to - be @entity109 , 30 was involved in a mid-air hen party brawl with her bridesmaid @entity113 , 33 during a flight from @entity23 to @entity99			2
and in february , disturbing footage of furious passengers kept on a grounded @entity4 flight for 11 hours emerged on @entity118			0
police were eventually called because cabin crew would not allow the exasperated passengers to leave the plane			2
the airline later apologised for the fiasco			0
a spokesman for @entity4 denied the claims			0
' this ' free bar ' story is totally untrue , ' they said			0
' there was no offer of a " free bar " on this or any other @entity4 flight and no free drinks were dispensed			2
' @entity136 were interacting with our customers and arranged a pass the parcel competition , but this was in a spirit of good fun ( which @entity4 crews are encouraged to do )			0
' the vast majority of our customers on this flight enjoyed this light - hearted fun and complimented the crew who were professional and attentive to our customers at all times during this four - hour 25 - minute flight			2
' while we are both surprised and regret that mr @entity37 , a 29 - year - old dj , may not have enjoyed this brief bit of fun , his claims of a " free bar " , a " quite heavy bundle " and " unprofessionalism " are simply untrue			0
