a council has been slammed for advising children how to take pills , snort cocaine and smoke cannabis in a controversial booklet			1
the leaflet , which targets pupils as young as 13 , gives ' safety tips ' on how to take illegal substances and was produced by @entity11 council and the city 's @entity12			1
the booklet includes street names for drugs , the ' effects and risks ' of taking them and finally ' safety tips ' for those ' determined to use ' drugs			1
pupils are advised to ' sleep well ' before and after using cocaine , avoiding mixing with alcohol , to ' wash out your nose after each session ' and to ' avoid sharing rolled - up bank notes or straws '			1
when taking mdma or ecstasy , children are told to ' start with a half a pill and wait at least two hours before re-dosing ' and to ' sip water regularly ' but no more than ' one pint an hour '			1
they are also advised to ' take regular breaks from dancing to cool down			1
' in the advice pack , children are given ' safety tips ' on how to take cocaine , as well as its street names the booklet tells youngsters to ' take regular breaks from dancing ' when taking ecstasy elsewhere , they are advised to only take ' short puffs ' of cannabis if inhaling and to use ' low strength tobacco and unprinted roaches if smoking '			1
the ' @entity52 ' book is aimed at 13 to 25 - year - olds and was launched yesterday for @entity55 pupils , aged either 15 or 16 , at @entity56 , in @entity11 , with other schools expected to follow in the coming months			1
the controversial approach has been criticised by anti-drug campaigners			0
@entity60 , msp for the @entity62 and a former police officer , told @entity64 : ' i do n't believe that such publications are helpful			0
' the minds of young people are inexperienced and this sort of thing will only help to confirm in their view that taking drugs is an ok past time			1
' i would much prefer it if the authorities tried to get people away from drug abuse , as young people will use any excuse they can to justify their behaviour			2
' mr @entity60 , who is also director general of the @entity81 , added : ' the levels of drug abuse in @entity84 and the number of drug deaths is still at a very high level and this year it was at its second highest level recorded			0
' it would be better to give young people a future and a hope of employment than giving this sort of advice , which is misplaced			1
' the controversial booklet has been slammed by critics who say it will make youngsters think drugs are ok when taking ecstasy , children are told to ' start with a half a pill and wait at least two hours before re-dosing ' @entity106 of the @entity107 , an anti-drugs charity said : ' i do n't know why anybody would put out a leaflet telling teenagers the safe way of taking drugs			1
' there is no safe way to take drugs			2
drugs destroy people so why would you want to put together a leaflet ? ' i 've never come across anything like this			1
i know they are putting them in schools and that there is other educational information in there			0
' but a lot of kids who do not know anything about drugs might read it and get the impression that there is a safe way to take drugs			0
' it 's like saying " here are 10 easy ways to take drugs "			2
the only safe guidance against drugs is not to take them at all			0
' @entity146 , @entity11 conservative leader , said he understood there was a need to issue advice on drug abuse , but questioned the distribution of the leaflet to all youngsters			2
he said : ' i do understand the need to give important advice to people who are vulnerable to illegal behaviour , but for something to be distributed to all young people is perhaps not the right way			2
' there are a lot of complicated issues there , but it raises questions about legitimising inappropriate behaviour			0
' it seems inappropriate to be highlighting unwise behaviour			0
' but @entity170 , a development officer for the @entity171 which is leading the project , said it was the best way to keep teenagers safe			0
she said : ' some young people will look things up on the internet but many will not			0
without all the facts they are in a more dangerous situation			0
' we completely accept there are going to be young people who do n't take drugs or drinks or have sex , and we would support them in that			2
' but they are a small group , as are the ones who are taking lots of drugs			0
it 's the majority who are undecided			0
