a cancer patient who was forced to have a section of his upper jaw removed has been given an entirely new set of teeth built by a 3d printer			1
the 41 - year - old man , from @entity7 , @entity8 , was left unable to eat or speak properly after undergoing the operation when he was diagnosed with mouth cancer			1
it also left him with large gaps in his teeth that made him feel self - conscious about his appearance			2
a team of scientists were able to give him a new set of teeth , right , to fill in the top row realistic : a picture of the mould of the man 's mouth , built using a 3d printer , reveals how closely the scientists were able to match the shape and colour of the new set to the patient 's original teeth self - conscious : the man , from @entity7 , first sought help from dentists to try and fix the gap in the roof of his mouth , left , caused by the surgery			1
right : his smile shows the 3d - printed teeth built by scientists solution : as well as losing a number of teeth , the patient had a section of the roof of his mouth and part of his jaw removed			1
above , the areas that were rebuilt in the 3d printer are coloured to look like his natural mouth but he is now able to use his mouth with greater ease after a team of scientists used a 3d printer to model and build the section of his jaw that was removed			1
the patient had to undergo the surgery in order to remove the cancer in the roof of his mouth			2
he experienced further complications after developing radiation - induced lockjaw following six weeks of radiotherapy treatment			0
the condition , which limited his ability to open his mouth , affected his eating and his speech			0
the upper jaw surgery also had a severe impact on his appearance			2
dentists were reluctant to give him any sort of implant , as taking an impression and producing a mould proved problematic given his inability to open his mouth			0
but a local company that specialises in 3d printing for healthcare became involved in the patient 's case			0
digital solution : as the man was unable to fully open his mouth to allow doctors to take a conventional mould , a ct scan was used to create a 3d reconstruction of the patient 's face , pictured above next step : the model of his jaw , pictured above , was able to simulate the movements of his joint and mimicked the mouth opening fully			1
this allowed the scientists to make sure that he would have a full range of movement perfect fit : using the 3d - printed replica as a template , a wax model was produced and adjusted to make sure that it would fit the patient as comfortably as possible			0
above , part of the 3d - printed jaw is seen treatment : @entity123 , a @entity125 - based company that specialises in @entity89 for healthcare , became involved in the patient 's case after dentists said he could not be fitted with a dental implant using a ct scan to create a 3d reconstruction of the patient 's face , the company , @entity131 , printed a replica of the patient 's mouth , complete with lower and upper jaw , the defect and his teeth			1
the model was able to simulate the movements of his joint and mimicked the mouth opening fully - overcoming the issue of making a mould from the patient 's jaw			2
using the 3d - printed replica as a template , a wax model was produced and adjusted to make sure that the fit was correct			0
this was then hardened , fitted with teeth and given to the patient			0
he is now able to chew , swallow , speak and smile with greater ease .			0

the 41 - year - old man from @entity7 was diagnosed with mouth cancer
he was forced to have a section of his upper jaw removed in operation
left him with part of his mouth exposed and unable to eat or *sleep* properly
section of his jaw that was removed was modelled and built on 3d printer
