but the court heard the defendant accepted that once he realised the bottle contained alcohol , he continued to drink from it			2
sentencing @entity0 , judge @entity48 said : ' it 's tragic that someone of your standing and with such an impressive past career should have destroyed all of that in one day			1
' it was an appalling breach of your duty			1
you put yourself in a condition where you were unable to discharge your duty as pilot of a hovercraft and your responsibilities to your passengers , the crew and the other users of the @entity67			2
' your actions could have resulted in tragedy but fortunately they did not			2
' miss @entity25 described how @entity0 had driven the @entity71 craft @entity72 from @entity23 to @entity73 , @entity74 , with 95 passengers on board when it failed to reach the landing pad			1
he then piloted the same craft back across the @entity67 with 36 passengers on board when his assistant , handling agent @entity81 , realised @entity0 had slowed down in the path of a tanker heading towards @entity85			1
mr @entity86 said : ' what is normal procedure , if safe to do so , the hovercraft will cross in front of of the tanker and not reduce the speed			0
' at that point the defendant increased his speed and he averted a potential incident			0
' miss @entity25 then described how @entity0 started to lose control of the craft as it arrived at @entity23 , missing the landing pad and headed towards @entity110			1
she said that @entity0 collapsed at the controls and mr @entity81 had to take urgent action to take control of the craft			1

@entity0 was responsible for operating a @entity118 like this one on a five - mile journey from @entity120 to @entity23 @entity0 narrowly missed busy pier , seen in the background , and then failed to steer into the landing pad at @entity23 ' @entity110 is a traditional wooden pier , it carries a passenger train and vehicles and during summer it 's very , very busy			1
' as the landing was being made , mr @entity81 asked the defendant if he was ok , to which the defendant replied that he was			0
' the handling agent pointed out to the defendant he was n't in line with pad as he was supposed to be			0
the defendant slightly adjusted the control but as he went to take control of the throttle , it appeared his hand slipped , he missed the control and he went to reach for it again			0
' unfortunately the adjustment made was n't enough and the hovercraft was heading towards the pier rather than towards the pad			0
@entity71 provides the fastest way to cross the @entity67 with a journey of less than 10 minutes			2

the steering of the craft is controlled by rudders , which are located in the slipstream behind each propeller			0
the captain can also use the propellers to change the direction of the craft			0
' once again the defendant was asked if he was ok , at that point there was no positive response			0
' upon a further question being asked , it was noticed the defendant had drooped and he had gone limp in the chair			0
' as there was no response from the defendant , mr @entity81 took immediate action and taking control of the hovercraft he landed it safely			0
' the court was shown @entity188 footage showing the hovercraft weaving as it arrived at @entity23 and coming to a halt as it headed in the wrong direction away from the landing pad and towards @entity110			1
the court was told it was at this point that mr @entity81 took over the controls and brought it to safety before another pilot came on board to bring it to the landing pad			2
@entity0 was taken to hospital by paramedics who noticed his speech was slurred and he was having ' alcohol sweats ' and six hours after the crossing , he gave the positive breath test			1
judge @entity208 said : ' common sense says he did n't drink anything in the hospital and he must have been significantly more affected when he left the craft			2
' describing @entity0 's actions as a ' grave dereliction of duty ' , miss @entity25 added : ' it 's perhaps fortunate there was no serious injury or death from this incident			1
' @entity220 , defending , said that @entity0 , a married father of two teenage sons , was of impeccable character and with 14,000 hours in charge of a hovercraft , he was @entity71 's most experienced pilot			1

pictured , the @entity71 terminal at @entity23 , @entity11 he described how his client had been operating the hovercraft that day in hot conditions in the cabin and had felt unwell and dehydrated			1

he continued : ' the bottle is in the pilot 's mess , it 's not unusual for bottles and lost property to make its way into the pilots ' mess room			0
he took the bottle on board			0
' the @entity248 had only finished a week previously , how it found its way into the mess is not known			0
' he was consuming something he did n't know what it was , he should have been aware of what had been consumed			0
' mr @entity0 is as shocked and surprised as anyone that he was over the limit and secondly by so much			1
' he added : ' he had in the past sought help for dependency on alcohol when he was a much younger man in the @entity259 but i understand he had come to terms with that many years ago			1
' mr @entity220 continued : ' the effect of what happened that day has brought about a severe bout of depression			0
he is a man consumed with remorse for what happened			0
' after the hearing , miss @entity25 confirmed that the sentence did not prohibit him from getting behind the wheel of a car			2
a @entity71 spokesman said : ' throughout the court proceedings @entity71 has co-operated fully with the @entity276 's investigation			0
' following sentencing today , we can now conclude our own investigation			0
' @entity71 is fully committed to the health and safety of passengers and staff , with a comprehensive set of robust policies and a zero tolerance to alcohol and drugs all endorsed by the @entity276			2
' @entity288 , @entity289 , said : ' the master of any vessel has a duty of care to their crew and passengers , so to carry out this responsibility whilst under the influence of alcohol is totally irresponsible			1
' mr @entity0 was clearly not in any fit state to carry out his duties safely			2
it is incredibly fortunate that no - one was hurt in this case			2
' i would like to take this opportunity to praise the quick thinking of a crew member on board the @entity310 for safely bringing the craft to a stop in @entity23 and also to thank @entity71 for its cooperation and assistance throughout this investigation			2
