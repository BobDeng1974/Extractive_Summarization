since @entity1 disappeared from our screens in february in a flurry of betrayal , dead bodies and elaborate plot twists , it 's been a frustrating time for fans of @entity10			1
what was in the files that @entity14 detective @entity13 saw that related to the childhood of his blunt - speaking @entity16 colleague @entity1 ? is @entity13 himself guilty of murder ? @entity20 suspense : @entity21 stars as @entity1 in the brilliant cross-border drama @entity1 and does the temperature ever rise above freezing in this corner of @entity20 ? the good news is that we wo n't have to wait too much longer to find out			1
filming for a third series of the @entity30 hit is under way , so there was only one thing to do - head to the scene of the crime			1
the drama takes its name from the five - mile bridge across the @entity40 , linking @entity41 and @entity42			1
in the first series , a body is found at the point on the bridge where @entity14 and @entity16 meet , which is why detectives from both countries are brought together to solve the case			2
our base for the night is a 1960s motel , the @entity52 , just outside @entity42 - it 's where @entity13 stays when his wife kicks him out after discovering he has been unfaithful			1
in @entity1 , it 's a symphony of misery , augmented by depressing decor , despair and @entity13 's haunting visions in the subterranean swimming pool			1
in reality , it 's a clever , chic budget hotel , filled with thoughtful @entity10 furniture and views of the forest			1
in the morning , happy families tuck into a generous breakfast buffet before heading out into the sunshine			0
scene of the crime : the series is pinned to the finding of a body on the bridge that crosses the @entity40 strait by and large , there 's a lot of rain , snow and sleet in @entity1 , and the drama certainly does n't showcase the architecture of the two cities			1
this is mostly by design , according to scriptwriter @entity85 , when i track him down in @entity42			1
we meet in the @entity89 , a cafe at the end of a pier which is the site of a pivotal scene in the first series when @entity13 realises just who might be responsible for a series of murders			2
over coffee and cinnamon buns , i subject hans to a police - style interrogation			0
what 's happened to cuddly @entity13 ? will @entity105 , his glamorous but decidedly non-cuddly colleague , ever get a boyfriend , or even master the art of small talk ? will we be seeing more of @entity105 's vintage mustard - coloured @entity110 and leather trousers ? the next series will apparently be about responsibility and notions of family while also delving into @entity105 's childhood			2
i hoover up the dramatic crumbs as eagerly as i 've been devouring the tasty cinnamon buns			0
then it 's time for a tour designed for @entity1 obsessives			1
we start in @entity42 , a powerhouse during medieval times , when its wealth was built on the herring trade			1
the gorgeous city centre includes @entity129 , a square filled with half - timbered houses , bars and happy @entity16 celebrating the weekend in the early autumn sun. @entity42 is @entity16 's most multi-cultural city , a legacy of its ship - building days			2
a rather brighter side of @entity20 : @entity41 is famous for its colourful dock area @entity138 that industry may have dwindled away , but now it 's also a showcase of cutting - edge , sustainable architecture , especially the @entity144			2
it 's apparently where @entity105 lives ( alone )			0
our bus takes us past some of the buildings that feature in the second series , including the site of the @entity42 police station that is actually part of a hospital , and has a exterior that 's dark grey / blue			1
' the designer is very into this colour , ' says our guide , as we head off to a street in the same muted palette			0
then it 's time for the highlight - a trip across the bridge itself			0
there 's a slow incline as we head out from @entity42 , and before we reach the central area we pick up a key bit of information with which we can share with less informed devotees at home : the actual border is a few hundred yards further along , and a simple sign denotes we have now reached @entity14			1
once in @entity41 , we eschew such commonplace tourist sights as the @entity179 and colourful harbour of @entity138 in favour of the modernist architecture of the @entity41 police headquarters and the trendy harbourside building that serves as the home of it entrepreneur @entity186 in series two			1
most of @entity1 is actually filmed along the @entity16 coast in @entity190			2
this cute town - population around 20,000 - regularly sees some of the darkest fictional deeds unfold in its streets			0
the real police investigate one murder a year here on average , but thanks to @entity200 , the creator of local detective @entity201 , dozens of fictional ones have taken place in its cobbled streets			0
dusting down his weariest expression : @entity206 is filming a new series of @entity201 in @entity41 the tourist board has a handy map with blood splashes to denote the area			1
and the body count is set to rise alarmingly			0
from this month , @entity206 will be dusting down his weariest expression to film @entity201 in one studio , with @entity105 striding around in @entity1 in the next one , while both will make regular forays into the @entity190 and @entity42 and nearby countryside for location shoots			1
the locals are pretty blasé about these incursions - many of them have acted as extras and do n't bat an eye at one of the full - scale bollywood film productions that regularly turn up here either			0
the @entity201 industry is kept low - key , largely because @entity200 has refused to allow commercialism			2
a @entity190 cafe that features as the diabetic detective 's favourite tried to introduce a @entity201 cake			0
@entity200 refused , but you can find it today - a family called @entity201 gave the cafe permission to name it after them			0
a conspiracy of sugar , cream and @entity20 baking excellence , it would have been a crime not to experience it			0
double rooms at the @entity52 ( www.scandichotels.com ) start at £ 75 per night			0
the @entity245 costs around £ 33pp			0
for more information , go to www.visitskane.com/en			0
return flights to @entity41 from @entity248 with @entity249 ( www.flysas.co.uk ) start at £ 110pp .			2

hit crime series @entity1 splits its action between @entity42 and @entity41
filming of a third series of the @entity10 *thriller* is currently in progress
fans of the show can find key sights on both sides of the @entity40 strait
