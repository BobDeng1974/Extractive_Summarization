by @entity0 @entity1 is under pressure to allow billions of pounds in military spending to count toward his controversial commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aid			1
senior ministers are backing plans to overhaul the rules governing what can count as aid spending , arguing that @entity13 spending on things such as police training in @entity16 and support to stabilise @entity18 should be included			2
defence ministers and senior officers have privately been seething at the ring - fencing of the foreign aid budget while spending on the @entity24 is being squeezed			1
@entity1 ( left ) is under pressure to allow billions of pounds in military spending to count toward his commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aid and ( right ) @entity30 mp @entity30 mp , the prime minister ’s envoy to @entity33 , has now drawn up detailed proposals for @entity35 suggesting that there is an overwhelming case for military spending to count toward the 0.7 per cent target – set to cost £ 12billion this year			1
‘ it is immaterial who signs the cheques , but the nature of the work undertaken , ’ the mp writes in a paper seen by the @entity44			0
‘ the current system ( or lack thereof ) inhibits some departments , notably the @entity13 , from claiming against millions of pounds worth of stabilisation / post-conflict activity			0
’ mr @entity30 said ‘ billions ’ of the £ 29billion spent by the military in @entity54 and @entity16 should have counted toward official development assistance ( @entity52 ) commitments			0
critics of the existing international rules say it is absurd that they rule out most kinds of military expenditure			0
for example , ministers point out that when @entity62 was despatched to deliver supplies to the victims of @entity65 in the @entity66 last year , the @entity13 was allowed to class only the cost of the ship ’s fuel as foreign aid			1
when @entity62 was dispatched to deliver supplies to the victims of @entity65 , the @entity13 was allowed to class only the cost of the ship ¿ s fuel as foreign aid the @entity13 has already been pushing for the @entity79 to pay when @entity81 transport aircraft and helicopters are used for humanitarian work , disaster relief and peacekeeping operations			1
if more defence spending on such efforts was regarded as foreign aid , @entity86 would much more easily meet its target of spending 0.7 per cent of national income – criticised by many @entity93 mps at a time of domestic austerity			1
@entity33 ’s secretary general @entity96 has also said allies need to modernise their armed forces and spend more on defence as @entity100 tries to ‘ carve up ’ @entity101			2
the @entity102 ( @entity102 ) , which monitors nations ’ efforts to meet foreign aid targets , is due to meet this weekend in @entity106 to begin work on a potential overhaul of the system			2
@entity86 could back a move led by the @entity111 to allow more defence spending to count as aid , according to @entity115 sources			2
but @entity116 of the @entity118 charity , which works in 120 countries , said he was against changing the way aid spending is measured			0
‘ not every country arguing for reform is doing so because they want to maximise the impact on development spending on the poorest people , ’ he added			0
it is not clear whether mr @entity1 will back the call for a fundamental shake - up .			0
