passengers in cars and taxis are being exposed to air pollution up to 15 times greater than cyclists and pedestrians on busy city streets , a new study has found			1
travelling inside a vehicle could be much worse than cycling by the kerb or walking on the pavement because emissions are highest in the centre of the carriageway , where vehicles suck in dirty air from those in front , scientists say			1
their shocking findings were revealed following an experiment by a group of five mps who sit on the government ’s cross-party @entity24 ( @entity24 )			2
people in cars and taxis are being exposed to far more air pollution than those cycling and on foot each was provided with a gadget to measure airborne pollution levels , as well as a gps tracker device , by scientists from @entity35 , who analysed where pollution was at its highest during their travels across @entity39 and in their constituencies over a week in july			1
by far the highest levels of tiny particles of ‘ black carbon ’ or deadly soot breathed in by the @entity23 was during taxi journeys in cities			2
on average each inhaled around 50 million particles per breath while inside a cab in @entity39 , around seven times more than the six to seven million particles per breath inhaled while walking around @entity54 or @entity55 , and 15 times greater than levels recorded outside their eventual destination @entity58 where , on leaving the cab , levels fell to three million particles per breath			1
@entity39 mayor @entity63 ( right ) is expected to announce a new initiative to combat pollution next week in the wake of @entity67 ( left ) and the rest of the @entity24 's findings the findings are worrying because persistent inhalation of air pollution and traffic emissions have been linked to lower life expectancy and serious illnesses , including heart disease and cancer , as well as low birth weights and stunted lung development in children			1
@entity81 , a lecturer and air quality scientist at @entity35 , said that air pollutants , such as black carbon , nitrogen dioxide and the toxic leftovers of inefficiently burnt fuel , were highest in the middle of a carriageway and in the first two to three feet above the road , dropping off nearer to the kerb and pavement			0
‘ travelling in vehicles gave the greatest average exposure , ’ dr @entity81 said			0
five mps carried out the @entity24 study in @entity39 taxis ‘ when you are in a vehicle , nose to tail with those in front , you are right in the middle of the source of the pollution			1
‘ vehicles close together suck in each other ’s emissions			0
‘ the air intakes are in the engine compartment close to road level , so they pick up the fumes emitted by the vehicle in front of them			0
open windows are another route			0
’ dr @entity81 said often dirty air became trapped in cars and taxis , whereas cyclists and pedestrians had a constant ‘ flow of air ’ breezing in from all directions around them			1
the mps who took part in the research were chairwoman of the @entity24 @entity67 , fellow @entity23 @entity131 and @entity132 , and conservatives @entity133 and @entity130			0
they are investigating why diesel engines , which are now recognised as some of the worst pollutants , were mistakenly promoted by officials as environmentally friendly			0
on wednesday , @entity39 mayor @entity63 will appear before the @entity24 to explain why the capital persistently breaches @entity141 standards on pollution levels			1
mr @entity63 is expected to announce an new initiative – breathe @entity144 – where commuters will be asked to work from home or use bikes , trains and buses instead of cars and taxis when air pollution levels are highest			1
however , it is not just in @entity39 where pollution is a problem			0
mrs @entity67 ’s monitor saw her inhale more than 80 million particles per breath during a car journey in her @entity162 constituency , while mr @entity132 was exposed to 20 million particles per breath during a cab ride in @entity166			2
dense smog hangs over @entity39 , obscuring buildings like the shard earlier this year mrs @entity67 said : ‘ our monitoring equipment showed that people in vehicles were far more exposed to air pollution than they would be walking			2
‘ car makers test exhaust emissions but this raises a question about whether they should also be considering air quality inside vehicles			0
’ research suggests that up to 29,000 premature deaths are caused each year in @entity184 by pollution - 10 times the number of people killed in road accidents			2
those who live in big cities have a lower life expectancy , studies have found , because of poor air quality			1
@entity39 has by far the worst air pollution problem in the country - in 2010 , 3,389 people died and 41,404 years of life were lost as a result of air pollution in the capital , according to @entity200			1
the biggest concern is the tiny bits of carbon - around 30 times smaller than a human hair - which are so small they can get into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream , passing through major organs , such as the heart and brain			0
they can have immediate effects on people with existing health conditions , triggering asthma attacks , heart attacks and strokes			0
but , worryingly , pollution can also cause diseases in healthy individuals , such as heart disease , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( @entity223 ) and even cancer .			0

people in cars exposed to up to 15 times pollution of walkers and cyclists
emissions are highest in the centre of the carriageway , where the cars are
dirty air is sucked in through car air *filters* and breathed in by passengers
study run by @entity24 - cross-party group of five mps
mps inhaled average of 50 million soot particles per breath in @entity39 cab
those who live in big cities have lower life expectancies because of pollution
mayor @entity63 expected to announce new initiative later this week
