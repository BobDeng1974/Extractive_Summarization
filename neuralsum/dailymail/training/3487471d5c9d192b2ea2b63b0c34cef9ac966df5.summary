by @entity0 and @entity1 high demand : planning minister @entity3 warned 100,000 new homes will be built to accommodate the expanding @entity6 population a plan to build on two million acres of countryside to solve @entity6 ’s housing crisis has made planning minister @entity3 a @entity12 ‘ hate figure ’ , it was claimed today			1
the outspoken minister , promoted by @entity14 in this autumn ’s reshuffle , claimed ‘ another 2 to 3 per cent of land ’ needed to be developed to meet soaring demand for housing fuelled by immigration			1
but @entity12 mp @entity21 revealed voters in his @entity24 constituency are furious at the idea , insisting homes should be built on brownfield sites which have been developed before			1
last week mr @entity3 said migrants accounted for almost half of the housing demand , and his figures suggest 100,000 new homes a year will be needed to accommodate them			0
the minister added : ‘ we ca n’t go on like this			0
’ he alarmed conservationists by saying up to two million acres of green fields may have to be concreted over to deal with the housing shortage			0
now he is at risk of sparking a @entity12 revolt among mps with rural constituencies and voters who do not want to see more development			1
mr @entity21 told @entity45 : ‘ @entity46 is rapidly becoming a hate figure			1
‘ they would much prefer building on brownfield sites			1
’ mr @entity3 is the first government minister to draw a clear link between housing demand and the legacy of @entity55 ’s open - door immigration policy			1
he said : ‘ the fact is – and i am critical of the last government ’s immigration policies – we allowed the population of this country to expand dramatically			1
‘ the population of @entity64 has gone up by two million in the last ten years			0
these people now live here , these people are now @entity6 and they need homes just like other @entity6 people			0
‘ the fact is , 43 per cent of the new households which want a home , is accounted for by immigration			0
‘ we ca n’t go on like this			0
we need to have less immigration and more house - building and we might then have a civilised country			0
’ mr @entity3 warned the scale of demand meant large swathes of countryside would have to be sacrificed , because there were not enough empty homes or developed sites			1
but conservationist have accused him of advocating unnecessary development of irreplaceable beauty spots			0
@entity88 , chief executive of the @entity89 , said : ' mr @entity3 does not only ignore existing land availability , he fails to recognise that some aspects of nature are irreplaceable			2
' unlike new buildings , ancient woodland can not be recreated			0
we are told by the government that economic growth and environmental enhancement can go hand in hand but this kind of statement does little to promote confidence in its commitment to a balanced approach			2
' at risk : with a lack of both empty homes and developed sites where new homes could be built , @entity107 land may have to be sacrificed deputy prime minister @entity112 said last month that the number of households was forecast to expand at the rate of 230,000 a year			1
the figure supplied by mr @entity3 suggests that immigration will account for almost 100,000 of the total			0
mr @entity112 said total house building amounted to just 117,000 last year , adding : ‘ there ’s only one way out of this housing crisis : we have to build our way out			2
’ mr @entity3 angered conservationists by suggesting the total area of land under development should be increased by a third to ease the housing shortage			2
he said ministers would protect the @entity107 , but warned that large areas of ‘ open land ’ may have to be given over for housing			2
and he hit out at developers for building ‘ pig ugly ’ housing estates that deter communities from accepting any new development			0
‘ we ’re going to protect the @entity107 but if people want to have housing for their kids they have got to accept we need to build more on some open land , ’ mr @entity3 said			1
‘ in the @entity6 and @entity64 at the moment we ’ve got about 9 per cent of land developed			2
all we need to do is build on another 2 to 3 per cent of land and we ’ll have solved a housing problem			1
’ @entity149 accused mr @entity3 of making up figures ‘ on the back of a fag packet ’ , while the @entity64 said his proposals were a licence to developers to ‘ let rip ’ .			0

call to build on ' another 2 to 3 *%* of land ' sparks *backlash* from @entity160 voters
@entity12 mp @entity21 says the government should focus on developing brownfield sites
