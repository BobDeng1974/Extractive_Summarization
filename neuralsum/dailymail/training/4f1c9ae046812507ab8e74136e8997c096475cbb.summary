the neice of @entity1 alerted child protection authorities that her paedophile uncle was caring for a baby 10 weeks before news of the @entity8 surrogacy scandal made international headlines			1
the @entity10 of child protection was made aware of the fact on may 15 , but acted only after news of the baby @entity15 scandal broke to alert the @entity16 they were being investigated for taking @entity15 's healthy twin sister , @entity17 , under their wing			1
@entity21 premier @entity20 told parliament on wednesday that the niece had alerted the @entity10 , whose minister @entity24 claims she knew nothing about until august 4 - 10 weeks after			1
' ' anybody bringing information to the department does so probably with some concern for themselves in that circumstance , ' the @entity37 reported			2
she said the niece 's tip would have likely been caught up in one of 20,000 notifications handled by the department each year			2
@entity37 child protection minister @entity24 she also said the department would have made a judgement call not to prioiritise the matter based on ' incomplete information ' the neice provided			1
she said : ' they ( welfare officers ) made a priority that in hindsight was not a good priority call			0
' the news comes as ms @entity24 told media yesterday that mrs @entity27 had taken baby @entity17 to @entity29 to grieve the death of her mother and would be returning at the end of the month			1
she said the department was aware of her departure and ongoing contact was being made on a daily basis with mr @entity1			1
she made the admissions about knowing mr @entity1 had a child ' through an unknown arrangement ' during a sitting of @entity21 parliament on tuesday			1
the minister said she found out on august 4 and an investigation began two days later			0
on wednesday , she said the delay in investigating the @entity74 's circumstances was unacceptable and it came about because the @entity76 team was overstretched at the time and had not correctly assessed the case as being a high priority			0
the person who had provided the tip - off had spoken in a very guarded way , so the information was ' fairly scant and a bit sketchy , and hard for the department to follow through with ' , ms @entity24 said			1
@entity88 mother @entity87 has been given the responsibilityof caring for the nine month old since he was abandoned by @entity37 his parents ' no address , little information about the child and how it came to be in that place et cetera - there was a paucity of information			2
' ' this , i think , was a case of staff having too much to do at the same time			0
' she said the case was still being assessed by the department , but the process had been held up because mr @entity1 's partner , @entity107 , had gone to @entity29 after the death of her mother , and taken @entity17 with her			1
' in the meantime , we 've been having daily contact with mr @entity1 , ' ms @entity24 said			0
opposition spokesman @entity113 said the revelations were a disgrace and ' heads should roll ' at the department			0
' somebody has dropped the ball , ' he said			0
' it 's a terrible indictment on the state government and the department that this issue has been let go on for so long			2
' ' i think the department is still under pressure and i am not sure whether every case is getting the attention it deserves			0
' but ms @entity24 said a second @entity76 team had been added after a four - month review that ended in august			0
' i 'm assured that something like this wo n't happen again , ' she said .			0

@entity21 @entity131 knew @entity1 was caring for baby @entity17
however it said it didnt investigate sooner because of ' incomplete information ' provided by neice of @entity1
@entity21 department began investigation as the story broke across the world
the news comes as it is revealed @entity27 has travelled to @entity29 to grieve for her dead mother
she has taken twin of @entity15 , @entity147 , with her which could stall @entity21 government 's investigation
