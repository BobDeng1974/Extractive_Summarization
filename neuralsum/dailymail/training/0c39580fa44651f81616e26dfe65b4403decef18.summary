by @entity0 it might feel as if you are just one big bill away from bankruptcy , but a report published today shows that the average worker is actually ‘ a millionaire ’ - eventually			2
if you start work at the age of 18 , you will have earned a total of £ 1million by the age of 56 and a half as long as you do not take any career breaks , such as a period of unemployment			2
but it usually takes much longer for women - age 70 as opposed to 51 for men - to have earned one million pounds			0
' this time next year , we 'll be millionaires ' : @entity21 ( @entity22 , centre ) famously says to his brother @entity24 ( @entity25 , right ) in @entity27 comedy @entity28 that their luck will eventually turn the report , from the insurance giant @entity32 , says it is ‘ entirely possible ’ for most workers to hit the seven - figure landmark			1
you do not even have to be a high earner , running a @entity38 company or coming up with the next idea for a @entity41 , @entity42 or @entity40			0
the calculations are based on the average salary for each age group from the official earnings figures published by the @entity47			1
it assumes that you earn the average salary for your age group at all times			1
for example , you are earning £ 9,317 a year between the age of 18 and 21 , £ 20,439 between the age of 22 and 29 rising to a peak of £ 31,312 in your 40s			1
but today ’s report does highlight the huge gulf between the amount of money that men earn , compared to the amount that their female colleagues earn			0
in many cases , the two are doing exactly the same job – but the man is just paid more money to do it			0
gender split : it usually takes much longer for women - age 70 as opposed to 51 for men - to have earned one million pounds ( file picture ) on average , a man will have ‘ earned his first million ’ by the age of 51			2
but a woman does not reach the landmark until she is 70 because her earnings tend to be so much lower			0
the shocking 19 - year wait faced by women is entirely due to the fact that their salaries tend to be so much lower than men ’s salaries			2
' being a millionaire is a dream for most of us			0
but the reality is that the average @entity93 employee will easily earn £ 1million in a lifetime of work ' @entity96 , @entity32 in his 40s , a man ’s earnings usually peak , with an average salary of £ 40,246			1
by comparison , a woman in the same age group is earning only £ 22,275			1
even when a woman ’s earnings peak in her 30s , her salary is only £ 23,075			1
@entity96 , a retirement expert at the @entity32 , said : ‘ being a millionaire is a dream for most of us			0
but the reality is that the average @entity93 employee will easily earn £ 1million in a lifetime of work			1
’ while they might have earned £ 1million , they do not actually get to spend this amount of money			0
by the time the average worker has earned their first million , they will have paid approximately £ 123,300 in tax and £ 93,200 in @entity121 , a total of £ 216,500 .			0
