@entity0 has said that his biting is an ‘ impulse ’ which he is getting help to control			1
the @entity6 forward has bitten three opponents during his career , most recently @entity9 during the @entity10			1
‘ i believe i am on the right path now , dealing with the people who can help me , ’ he told the @entity11			2
‘ it is like an impulse , like a reaction			1
in my case , the pressure and tension came out that way			0
there are other players who react by breaking someone ’s leg , or smashing someone ’s nose			0
what happened with @entity9 is seen as worse			0
i understand why biting is seen so badly			2
’ and in extracts taken from his upcoming autobiography crossing the line : my story , @entity0 questions the double standards in @entity50 football following his second biting incident with @entity53 's @entity52			1
he said : ' after my 10 - match ban in 2013 for biting @entity52 , i had questioned the double standards and how the fact that no one actually gets hurt is never taken into consideration			2
the damage to the player is incomparable with that suffered by a horrendous challenge			0
@entity0 was banned for biting @entity53 defender @entity52 ' sometimes @entity50 football takes pride in having the lowest yellow - card count in @entity65 , but of course it will have if you can take someone ’s leg off and still not be booked			1
when they can say it is the league with the fewest career - threatening tackles , then it will be something to be proud of			0
' i know biting appalls a lot of people , but it ’s relatively harmless			2
or at least it was in the incidents i was involved in			0
when @entity52 rolled up his sleeve to show the referee the mark at @entity83 , there was virtually nothing there			0
none of the bites has been like @entity88 on @entity90 ’s ear			0
but none of this makes it right			0
' @entity0 ’s four - month man for biting the @entity28 defender has now ended , but @entity6 manager @entity96 is still undecided over whether to throw the @entity98 straight into the starting line - up against @entity18			1
' @entity0 will get minutes but i ca n't say how many , ' said @entity96			1
' this is a great chance for him to incorporate himself in the team			0
how many minutes he will get i ca n't say			0
' @entity6 manager @entity96 ( pictured , behind ) confirmed @entity0 is set to make his competitive debut @entity0 was allowed to train and play friendlies with his @entity6 team - mates during his four - month ban @entity0 has said biting is ' like an impulse ' and that ' everyone has different ways of defending themselves ' @entity9 became the third victim in @entity0 's career after the controversial striker served previous bans for biting @entity116 's @entity115 in 2010 and @entity53 defender @entity52 in 2013			1
@entity115 , @entity116 - november 2010 @entity52 , @entity53 - april 2013 @entity9 , @entity117 - june 2014 @entity0 moved to @entity6 from @entity118 for £ 75million during the summer , and was initially banned from all football - related activity by @entity121			1
an appeal to the @entity123 , however , ruled that last season 's @entity125 top goalscorer was allowed to train with his new team - mates and play in @entity6 friendlies			2
the game against @entity18 will be @entity0 's first competitive match since @entity132 's 1 - 0 defeat against @entity117 on june 24			1
meanwhile , @entity18 coach @entity133 has confirmed that @entity134 will miss the game with a buttock injury .			2
