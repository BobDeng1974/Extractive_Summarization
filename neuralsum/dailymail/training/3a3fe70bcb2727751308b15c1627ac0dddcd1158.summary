they might own vast chateaux , private jets galore and ocean - going super-yachts but all billionaires really want is to be normal			0
@entity6 , the man behind a new documentary , @entity5 , says the world 's wealthiest put everyday experiences such as a hassle - free walk along the street above amassing a wardrobe of @entity13 or lavish spending sprees			1
@entity6 , whose credits also include @entity16 , spent months with the world 's wealthiest in a bid to find out what makes them tick			1
@entity6 directed @entity5 , a look at the real lives of the world 's wealthiest people ' what 's really fascinating is that it 's such a closed off world to the rest of us , ' he explains			1
' the way the world is changing at the moment is moving things very much in their direction			0
' the super rich are no longer just of freak interest - they 'll be playing a real role in future			1
what 's interesting is because governments are essentially broke , the onus will fall more on the super rich and corporations to do more			1
the role is being pushed upon them			0
' in the documentary , which will be screened tonight on @entity44 , @entity6 meets some of the @entity46 's wealthiest residents , among them @entity47 and @entity49 boss , @entity48			1
according to @entity6 , mr @entity48 , who is thought to be worth around £ 650m , does n't consider himself particularly wealthy			1
' it 's kind of interesting that the wealthy never see themselves as wealthy , ' he explains			0
' not even billionaires see themselves as wealthy because they 're always looking to the next person			0
' @entity48 , who owns @entity55 football club as well as @entity47 , told me that he would n't call himself rich and that i should look at someone like @entity58 , the founder of @entity59			1
' @entity47 and @entity49 boss @entity48 might be worth £ 650m but he 'd rather eat baked beans wealthy @entity62 such as @entity63 place a high value on @entity66 's safety and tolerance @entity58 is worth an estimated $ 29.7bn making him wealthier than @entity48 but considerably poorer than @entity68 , the @entity69 telecoms magnate who , with his $ 79.6bn fortune , is the world 's wealthiest man			1
regardless of whether their wealth can be counted in the billions or hundreds of millions , @entity6 says the majority have surprisingly simple tastes			1
' billionaires are expected to own things like @entity78 , super-yachts and so on			0
but if you speak to very wealthy people , they see that as a bit tacky			2
' as @entity48 said to me , " why would i want to spend all my time sitting around on a boat in the ocean ? it would be boring ! " ' instead , says @entity6 , what the super rich really want are ' experiences '			1
' it 's about exclusivity and experiences , ' he explains			0
' they want things that no - one else can have , like flying to the moon			0
bentleys , rolexes and all that stuff is just blingy and tacky			0
it 's the sort of thing that a footballer would have			0
' they all have this impish sense of humour about how people view them , ' continues @entity6			2
' they can be quite eccentric about not doing the things people expect them to do			2
' @entity48 , for instance , likes to go home and have beans on toast			1
' the same attitude influences their choice of place to live , with many choosing @entity66 partly because the city 's tolerant attitude allows them to live a normal life			2
' a lot are attracted to @entity66 because it 's multicultural , ' explains @entity6			1
' one @entity62 tycoon told me that , " here , i can take my kids to school "			0
' that would n't be possible in @entity127 because the risk of being robbed or kidnapped or having your money taken away by the government is all too real			0
' for people like him , being normal is an impossible luxury			2
billionaires love the idea they can get on the bus if they want			0
' @entity59 's @entity58 has amassed a $ 29bn fortune but @entity6 says billionaires do n't think themselves rich according to @entity6 , the very wealthy value experiences over expensive toys such as super yachts @entity63 lives on this @entity144 street , where prices start at £ 5m for a simple terraced house while they might want to get on the bus like the rest of us , the presence of the super-rich has also had an unexpected consequence in the shape of what @entity6 calls ' vertical aspiration '			1
' in the 1950s , people would keep up with @entity158 , with their neighbours			2
now , with the super rich , aspirations have gone through the roof			1
' you feel that you have n't made it if you do n't own a super-yachts or spend winter in @entity165			0
because of that , credit card spending has gone through the roof			0
' nevertheless , the wealthy , says @entity6 , are n't entirely to blame			2
' it is not all bad , ' he says			0
' people paint the super rich as these evil people			1
they are n't , they 're just trying to live their lives			2
' as normally as possible , it would seem .			0
