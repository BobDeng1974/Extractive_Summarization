@entity1 's drink drive limits will change at one minute past midnight tonight with motorists banned from having consumed more than 30mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood the drink drive limit in @entity1 will be significantly lowered tonight while the law in @entity8 stays the same			1
from one minute past midnight tonight , motorists crossing the border must not have more than 50mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood , thirty milligrams less than the limit in @entity8			1
while the change has been welcomed by anti-drink driving campaigners , an overwhelming majority of drivers said having different limits across the @entity19 was a bad idea			1
eighty - one per cent of those polled said they would rather see the same laws apply across @entity19 , according to the motor services company @entity24 , with forty per cent calling for the limit in @entity8 to be reduced			1
almost a quarter of the 2,607 asked suggested a blanket ban on drink - driving as a whole , no matter how much alcohol drivers had consumed , while 92 per cent added having different limits in @entity8 and @entity1 will be confusing for motorists			1
electronic signs and posters have been put up at service stations and on roads across @entity8 in a bid to let drivers know about the change			1
@entity1 's justice secretary @entity39 welcomed the change today			1
' alcohol at any level will impair your ability to drive - even at the new limit you are three times more likely to die in a crash than with no alcohol in your system			2
' this will bring @entity1 into line with most of @entity51			2
the evidence from the @entity53 , which has brought in the same lower limit , suggests we will see convictions go down , reductions in drink - driving and lower blood alcohol counts			2
' we are leading the way across the @entity19 - the new limit has backing from experts , road safety campaigners and the majority of the public north and south of the border			1
' when it comes to drinking and driving our advice is simple - it ’s just not worth it			0
do n’t put lives at risk , the best approach is to have no alcohol at all			0
' figures released by @entity74 earlier this year revealed there had been 440 alcohol related roadside accidents in 2012			0
more than 500 casualties were a result of such incidents , with 10 people dying in drink - fuelled collisions			0
@entity82 's , @entity1 's largest brewer , is supporting the new laws in the run up to @entity86			2
from tonight motorists crossing the border will face tougher laws on drink drive limits ( file image ) ' @entity92 takes its position on alcohol responsibility very , very seriously			2
' we ’re completely aligned with the government ’s position in terms of drink - driving and the alcohol limits that are being introduced			0
' the industry as a whole takes the position with regard to alcohol responsibility very , very seriously			0
' in reality we ’ve been preparing for this measure over a couple of years			0
' you will have seen a growth in the no - and low - alcohol categories , not as a direct consequence of the drink - driving legislation but just in terms of brewers and alcohol producers producing new categories to broaden choice on behalf of consumers			0
' last week @entity120 and @entity121 announced they would reveal the details of drivers who failed the ' walk the line ' drink drive test on @entity126			0
those charged with alcohol related offences will be ' named and shamed ' by the forces in a joint campaign to raise awareness of the dangers of driving while under the influence			0
the majority of motorists welcomed the change in @entity1 but said having different laws across the @entity19 would be confusing for drivers ( file image )			1

the legal limit will be lowered to 50mg per 100ml of blood in @entity1
laws will not change in @entity8 where the limit is 80mg per 100ml of blood
eighty - one per cent of drivers said limits should be the same across @entity19
