a devoted pet owner has spent £ 300 on saving the life of his goldfish after it became constipated			1
the man , who has not been named , took the fish to a veterinary practice in @entity6 , @entity7 , after noticing it was struggling to eliminate waste			1
he had hoped it would be a simple procedure but was told by staff at the @entity13 that the delicate surgery required to save his pet would cost £ 300			1
the company boss initially turned down the treatment but changed his mind 10 minutes later and went back to give the go - ahead			0
the three - inch pet went on to make a full recovery after the 50 - minute operation @entity26 , 29 , was then tasked with carefully administering anaesthetic before using tiny instruments to remove a lump close to the fish 's backside			1
a second lump was removed from his dorsal fin before the fish was returned to water and handed back to his grateful owner			1
ms @entity47 said the three - inch fish made a full recovery after the 50 - minute operation and said it would have died if it was left untreated			1
she said : ' i have never done a procedure like that on a goldfish , although i have done it before on more valuable fish like a carp			1
@entity26 , 29 ( pictured ) , carried out the delicate £ 300 operation on the constipated goldfish ' the actual surgery is quite straightforward but administering the anaesthetic is quite complicated			1
' the issue was the fish could n't poo and it would have eventually become toxic and it would have died			0
' there was nothing special about the fish			0
he just liked it a lot			0
people love their pets - but that was an expensive little goldfish			1
' the delicate procedure involved introducing a carefully - measured anaesthetising agent into the fish 's water			0
it was then removed from its tank and placed on a waterproof drape before anaesthetic water was put into its mouth via a tube and bubbled over its gills			2
ms @entity47 then used a miniature heart - rate monitor to check that the fish was properly ' under ' before using a mini scalpel to remove the lumps			2
she then sewed each cut with three stitches before using a special ' glue ' to cover and waterproof the fish 's scales before it was gradually re-awakened			0
@entity92 can live up to 10 years and this ailing pet was two years and 10 months old at the time of its operation			2
the @entity13 practice opened a year ago and specialises in exotic animals as well as the more usual pets			2
ms @entity47 revealed that in the past year she has carried out a string of bizarre operations including the removal of a 12g skin tumour from a two - inch long hognose snake			2
she has also successfully taken out a stone from the 5mm - wide ureter of a guinea pig and last week castrated a skunk			0
