by @entity1 reporter published : 19:13 est , 11 january 2013 updated : 12:10 est , 12 january 2013 athletes of all levels have always needed to monitor the possible danger of concussion on the sports field			1
now , a new gadget aims to simplify the assessment of a blow to the head , before producing an immediate signal about the severity of the incident			1
@entity14 , a skull cap produced by @entity17 and electronics company mc10 , fits underneath a helmet and uses sensor technology to monitor impact			1
safety first : the new skull cap will instantly analyze and indicate impact on the head during contact sports the control module at the back of the cap will flash yellow for moderate impact and red for severe blows to the head as reported by @entity35 , the device then flashes a color - coded led on the strength of the blow for all to see			1
@entity40 claim on their website that this ' smart , sensing skullcap serves as an extra set of eyes on the playing field , giving players , parents , coaches and trainers a visual measurement of force of impact to put athletes on a pathway to assessment			2
' a strip of flexible plastic inside the cap is packed full of sensors , measuring multi-directional and rotational acceleration , as well as the location and duration of impact			2
according to @entity35 , all this technology is connected to a microcontroller module at the back of the cap with three indicator leds			0
the sophisticated sensors inside the cap measure multi-directional and rotational acceleration , as well as the location and duration of head impact the technological cap fits round the head , so measures impact extremely accurately and it can also be used with multiple helmets one light shows the status of the rechargeable battery on board , then a yellow led flashes after moderate blows to the head and the third light flashes red after severe impact			1
this ensures that immediately after a potentially dangerous collision , everyone on the field is immediately notified			0
@entity40 hope that this will remove one of the biggest problems with concussion injuries - the fact that sports players often do n't even report such incidents			2
as the new product provides immediate and simple information , the makers hope that sports teams will be able to look out for and police each other			1
the @entity14 fits round the users ' head , rather being a part of the helmet , ensuring that it accurately measures potential damage to the body rather than just impact to the protective equipment			1
as such , the skull cap can also be used with a number of different helmets			1
both @entity17 and mc10 hope the equipment will be used at all sporting levels , including youth athletics			1
when @entity35 asked @entity119 - mc10 's director of licensing and business development and @entity121 player - about the potential cost of the device , he said it would be ' affordable and comparable to the cost of other sporting equipment			2
' @entity14 will be available in the first half of 2013			2
the dangers of concussion have long been a concern for athletes playing contact sports , especially in @entity121			1
legendary @entity121 linebacker @entity133 was found to have a degenerative brain disease caused by repeated blows to the head when he committed suicide in may 2012 on thursday , analysis of the brain of @entity121 legend @entity133 revealed that when he committed suicide last year he was suffering from a degenerative brain disease often linked with repeated blows to the head			0
researchers from the @entity145 said that the former football star 's abnormalities were consistent with chronic traumatic encephalopathy , or @entity148			0
the hard - hitting linebacker played for 20 @entity121 seasons with @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 before retiring in 2009			0
he died at age 43 of a self - inflicted gunshot to his chest in may 2012 , and his family requested the analysis of his brain			0
' we saw changes in his behavior and things that did n't add up with him , ' his ex-wife , @entity160 , told @entity166			0
' but ( @entity148 ) was not something we considered or even were aware of			0
but pretty immediately ( after the suicide ) doctors were trying to get their hands on @entity133 's brain to examine it			0
' the family of @entity133 spotted ' changes in his behavior and things that did n't add up with him			0
' this was a result of degenerative brain disease caused by repeated concussions			0

@entity14 , the new technological skull cap , analyses impact to the head during contact sports , then signals the severity of the incident
makers @entity17 and mc10 hope it will be used at all sporting levels , including in youth athletics
