the endangered @entity9 tree kangaroo , from @entity10 , was quickly reassured by its mother as she leaned forward to lick it			1
the hairless joey is confined to the pouch where it will continue to develop for several months before venturing away from its mother			2
first meeting : this is the moment a mother saw her baby for the first time , as the tiny @entity9 tree kangaroo poked its bald head out from the pouch though it is only just getting its first view of the world , this joey is believed to have been born around five months ago			1
as with most marsupials , tree kangaroos are born in an almost embryonic state after a pregnancy of about 44 days			2
the newborn is only the size of a jelly bean and slowly crawls into the mother 's pouch where it locks onto a nipple and then the majority of development takes place			0
even once it is big and strong enough to venture out from its mother 's pouch , the little joey will continue to clamber back in to rest and sleep and will not be totally weaned until it is around a year old			0
home : the hairless joey is confined to the pouch where it will continue to develop for several months before venturing away from its mother - not be totally weaned until it is around a year old the rare baby tree kangaroo has been bred in captivity at @entity54			1
it is the first baby for the three - year - old mother the first - time mother is three - years old and is on loan from the @entity59 in @entity60 and the five year old father is on loan from the @entity63 in @entity64			0
as part of the breeding loan agreement , the female offspring belongs to the @entity59 and will eventually become part of an international captive breeding programme			0
@entity54 has been a long time contributor to @entity9 tree kangaroo conservation efforts in the wilds of @entity10			1
@entity9 tree kangaroos live at high elevations in the @entity75 of @entity76 where they spend most of their time up in trees feeding on a variety of leaves , ferns , moss , and bark			2
the mother is on loan from the @entity59 , in @entity60 , and the five - year - old father is on loan from the @entity63 in @entity64 they are believed to be solitary animals and the only strong social bond formed is between a mother and her offspring			0
this new mother and her joey will remain off exhibit for several weeks to allow for proper bonding and to help facilitate a smooth introduction for this wonderful new addition .			0
