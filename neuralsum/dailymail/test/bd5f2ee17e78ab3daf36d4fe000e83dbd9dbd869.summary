@entity1 boss @entity0 has delivered a sharp rebuke to @entity3 after the winger criticised the training - ground methods deployed by the manager 's predecessors , @entity8 and @entity9			1
former @entity10 star @entity3 claimed last week that @entity0 had introduced a brand of coaching and tactical preparation which had been lacking under the previous management			1
but @entity0 , who is busy transforming the club on the pitch after three successive wins in the @entity18 , was less than impressed by the player 's comments and hinted that they may have been motivated by the player 's lack of game time under @entity8 and @entity9			1
@entity1 winger @entity3 spoke out about his former managers @entity8 and @entity9 ' @entity3 made an error , ' said the @entity28 midfielder			1
' he was out of the frame a wee bit under @entity9 and @entity31			2
' but he knows we are not here to criticise what went on before , because the players were part of that			0
all we are concentrating on is the here and now			0
' @entity0 also had words of warning for skipper @entity40 , claiming his red card against @entity10 could cost him his place in the @entity44 line - up			1
the defender has been given a two - match ban - starting with @entity47 at @entity48 on thursday - after being sent off on sunday			2
the @entity50 captain put his elbow into the face of @entity10 striker @entity53 as the pair jumped for a high ball			1
@entity0 , whose team clung on for a vital 2 - 1 win after playing 50 minutes a man down , had been happy with @entity40 's displays until that point			1
but the interim @entity1 manager has now warned the former @entity63 cap he is not ' undroppable '			0
he said : ' @entity40 made a poor decision			1
i understand why he did it but it was a blatant red card			1
he led with his elbow and it was wrong - but he knows he was wrong			0
' he has got to take his punishment and move on now			0
he has got a two - game ban - whether he gets back in the team thereafter we will see			0
@entity40 has been warned he could lose his place in the starting xi after being sent off against @entity10 ' since i 've been at the club he has done fine			1
he 's been good in the dressing room and his performances have been good			2
' if whoever comes in over the next two games does really well , then he might not get back in			0
' he 's not undroppable , no , but at this moment in time with the games we have played he has done nothing to merit being dropped			2
' off the field , @entity84 now hopes to get the @entity87 's blessing to take over as chairman after judges at the @entity90 approved his boardroom bid			2
but with 12 first - team players out of contract at the end of this season , @entity0 has warned his squad they may have to wait for new deals			1
he said : ' i do n't think it will be too long before @entity84 becomes chairman of the club , so that is another positive move			0
' i 'm just concentrating on the football			0
i 've spoken to a couple of directors about things but we have five games in 14 days so i 'm just focusing on that			0
' as for contracts , that can only be sorted when the club knows what league it 's going to be playing in next season , so that is the key			2
' the weekend victory over @entity10 moved @entity1 back into the box seat for the promotion play - offs			1
@entity1 boss @entity0 has led his team to three consecutive victories in the @entity18 but that now leaves @entity122 boss @entity0 facing the ' nightmare ' scenario that he could come up against his former @entity126 troops			1
@entity129 's 5 - 0 victory over basement boys @entity127 has all but spared them from the automatic relegation spot but @entity133 's team could yet be made to scrap for their @entity135 place against @entity1 in the play - off final			1
' it 's not looking likely at all because @entity129 are not going to finish in the bottom two - i hope , ' said @entity0			1
' first and foremost we have to do our job and get in the play - offs			0
' but i said when @entity129 signed @entity142 that i believed - and i still do - that they would have enough to get out of trouble			0
' before that , though , @entity0 must continue to rack up the wins , starting with thursday 's trip to @entity147			1
@entity1 lost 2 - 0 on their last visit in december - just hours after it was revealed @entity8 was stepping down as boss			0
' i 'm still aghast because i 've just watched a video of the second half , ' said @entity0			2
' i have n't showed the players because i think they know they were not in a good place at that time			2
' the news about @entity31 broke on the afternoon of the game and it was just a down day			0
as much as @entity1 underperformed , all credit goes to @entity47			0
they are a good side , especially down there			0
we know how difficult it will be			0
