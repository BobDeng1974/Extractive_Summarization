when i was opening a box of blueberries the noise of the plastic as i opened the lid set him off			0

@entity62 - also known as startle disease - is a rare neurological disorder which causes sufferers to react in an exaggerated way when startled			1
they become rigid and unable to move , and sometimes stop breathing , which can prove fatal			1
the main symptoms of the condition include stiffness that can prevent the person from moving			0
it can cause them to fall , stiffly , like a log , without loss of consciousness			0
when a baby startles , it may be accompanied by non-epileptic seizures with increased stiffness and twitching			0
simple activities , such as having a bath , can trigger the condition			0
there is no cure for the illness but medication can help to ease the symptoms			0
mrs @entity17 , a teaching assistant , said the condition means she worries about her son constantly			0
she said : ‘ i ’d love to wrap him up in cotton wool but i try to treat him as i would any child , although it ’s difficult to cut the apron ties as i worry about him all the time			0
’ @entity3 was born naturally five days early , weighing a healthy 7lb 10lbs			2
but within 32 hours mrs @entity99 and her husband @entity100 , 56 , a nursing assistant , knew something was wrong with their son noticing he was ‘ twitchy and upset '			0
@entity3 had to be fed through a tube because every time the family tried breast or bottle feeding he would spasm as his nose touched a teat			2
it was not until he was eight - months - old that experts made an official diagnoses , following a number of tests and examinations			0
now the family try to avoid anything that might scare @entity3 - even water being splashed on him			2
mrs @entity17 has to watch her son constantly so he does n’t choke , and worries that as a child he is oblivious to the danger presented by his seizures and spasms			2
she said : ‘ when @entity3 was initially diagnosed i felt ok about it because we were told that the most difficult time would be the first year of his life and i felt it could be worse			2
‘ but it ’s a very difficult condition to manage and i have to watch him all the time as he can choke on anything			2
‘ it is sad that he has this hereditary condition and i do worry that he will get teased as he gets older			0
' we just have to take it one day at a time , but @entity3 has not got an awareness of danger and that makes it even worse			2
’ despite his rare condition , parents say @entity3 is a ' quick , bright and intelligent ' boy who has a great sense of humour and is loved by everyone although there is no cure for the illness , @entity3 takes medication to relax his muscles tomorrow @entity3 will start his first day at school in @entity11 , @entity12 , and he will get one - to - one support to make sure he ’s safe and well			1
mrs @entity17 said : ‘ @entity3 has a brilliant sense of humour and he ’s a fantastic , funny boy that everybody loves			2
' he attracts people wherever he goes and he ’s always smiling			0
he is a very quick , bright and intelligent boy			0
’ both @entity156 and mrs @entity17 carry the faulty gene that causes hyperekplexia , but fortunately their eldest son , @entity159 , seven , did not inherit the illness			0
@entity3 is monitored by consultants at the @entity163 , based at @entity165 ’s @entity164 , and takes medication to relax his muscles			1
children ’s charity @entity168 has funded studies looking at the genes that cause the condition and mrs @entity17 is keen to raise awareness to the rare disease			1
dr @entity175 , research evaluation manager at @entity168 said : ‘ although the symptoms of startle disease often fade by the time babies reach their first birthday , they can continue throughout childhood and into adulthood , with some children experiencing severe breathing problems and others having learning difficulties			1
' both @entity156 and mrs @entity17 carry the faulty gene that causes hyperekplexia , but fortunately their eldest son , @entity159 , seven ( pictured right ) did not inherit the illness ' startle disease ' is so rare that it is thought to affect just 70 families worldwide			1
@entity191 is looking into the genes which cause the condition she added that further research could lead to a new genetic test to identify babies with ‘ startle disease ’			1
she said : ‘ action has funded research looking at the genes which cause startle disease in the hope of giving more babies access to a full diagnosis			1
‘ the research could lead to a new genetic test for babies and children			1
if diagnosed correctly , babies can be treated with drugs that help reduce the unwanted startle reaction and also reduce muscle stiffness			2
