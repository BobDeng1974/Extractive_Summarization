@entity0 will look to their @entity2 contingent to lead the charge against @entity4 in @entity5 as they attempt to make amends for their @entity8 defeat at the @entity9 last month			1
@entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 all return to the scene of the 19 - 9 defeat by @entity17 which halted another @entity19 crusade , and their club ’s head coach feels that setback could prove beneficial in their @entity25 quarter - final			1
@entity12 will be among @entity0 's @entity2 contingent in @entity5 on saturday @entity0 centre @entity12 has a point to prove after @entity2 ’s @entity8 defeat in @entity5 ‘ @entity10 , @entity13 , @entity12 and @entity11 have been telling the rest of the squad what the @entity33 is going to be like , ’ said @entity0 head coach @entity30			1
‘ their experience of that is valuable for us			2
‘ in the long run , these players come back better experienced and the fact they ’ve done what they ’ve done with @entity2 this season means they are not going to have any fear of going back to the @entity33			1
’ the leading quartet have points to prove in the @entity48 capital … @entity11 the lock produced an energetic performance for @entity2 but the line - out he was running crucially malfunctioned twice and he needlessly conceded a penalty			1
he will be determined to deliver a dominant carrying , aerial and defensive performance			0
@entity10 as the national team ’s playmaker , he was pressured by the intensity of the @entity48 defence and kicking game — which he did n’t manage to match — in an otherwise superb championship campaign			0
he will crave the platform to run the show with typical authority			0
fly - half @entity10 will seek to run the show for @entity0 in @entity25 quarter - final @entity12 @entity0 ’s electric centre was a deadly presence in @entity2 ’s midfield in other games but in @entity5 he was not given the ammunition to fire			1
if he is presented with enough ball then he has the individual talent to shred the home defence			0
@entity4 have been studying him carefully			2
@entity13 on the wing for @entity2 , the outing at the @entity9 was not his finest , as he struggled to handle the barrage from the air			1
on saturday , he will be positioned at full back for his club so he must be much more assured under the high ball and use his license to counter-attack from deep to full effect			2
and here are four of the @entity17 players in @entity4 colours aiming to sink @entity89 hopes again … @entity90 the @entity92 prop had a limited impact on @entity17 ’s @entity8 title success as he was eased back into action after injury			1
however , he starts today for the @entity97 and will be fired up to demonstrate his clout as a strong carrier who can also more than hold his own in the scrum battle			0
@entity4 's @entity103 ( right ) is a real threat as a strike runner @entity106 the experienced no 8 missed the visit of @entity2 after suffering fractured vertebrae in his back caused by the knee of @entity112 lock @entity113			1
these are the days — the big occasions — when he raises his game : strutting , charging and hitting rucks			0
@entity103 the @entity17 full back is imperious under the high ball so the test encounter with @entity2 last month suited him perfectly			2
he will be keen to provide a reminder of his threat as a strike runner but he also provides a crucial kicking outlet if the hosts are pinned down			0
@entity125 he ’s known as the ‘ @entity126 ’ and it is easy to understand how he came by that nickname			0
the @entity92 flanker is an imposing force of nature at full throttle			0
he will blast holes in the best defences and commit body and soul to every collision with a madcap , reckless intensity .			0
