by @entity1 reporter published : 21:03 est , 26 august 2013 updated : 06:38 est , 27 august 2013 dubious @entity3 ' friends ' could stand in the way of you getting a loan thanks to new technology			2
savvy start up lenders have started measuring the creditworthiness of potential borrowers by determining whether their pals pay off their debts			1
the tech start ups , including @entity15 , trawl through an applicants online friends in a bid to determine whether anyone in your network has failed to pay back a loan			1
' it turns out humans are really good at knowing who is trustworthy and reliable in their community , ' @entity23 , a co-founder and ceo of lending start up , @entity15 , told @entity29			2
' what 's new is that we 're now able to measure through massive computing power			0
' new technique : savvy start up lenders have started measuring the creditworthiness of potential borrowers by determining whether their friends on @entity3 pay off their debts ( stock photo ) traditional lenders , such as banks , rely heavily on official credit scores based on payment history			1
but newer lenders believe social connections can also be a good indicator of a person 's creditworthiness			2
after a quick search , @entity15 can work out if any of your @entity3 friends have been late paying back a loan to @entity15			1
if so , they 're less likely to offer you a line of credit			0
the situation gets even worse if the delinquent friend is someone you interact with regularly			0
another company , @entity58 - based @entity57 told @entity60 it uses @entity61 or @entity63 accounts as well as @entity3 to check whether a potential borrower is high or low risk			1
@entity57 also gathers information from the manner in which a customer fills out the online application - if someone uses all capitals or no capitals they 'll lose a few points			2
the business can determines your location based on where your computer is , and therefore takes into account where you live or work - the posher area the better obviously			0
the range of information about a would - be borrow does n't mean much apart but when brought together it paints a pretty good picture of the applicant , @entity81 , a co-founder of @entity57 , told the news website			0
other ways : other non-traditional lenders use @entity61 or @entity63 accounts as well as @entity3 to check whether a potential borrower is high or low risk @entity92 , an online service that offers cash advances to small businesses , says it can get ' much better , faster data ' than a traditional credit score by checking @entity98 , @entity61 and other online payment accounts for real time proof of creditworthiness			1
the company told @entity60 it can determine whether someone is worth the risk and put money into their account in just seven minutes			0
most lending start ups currently attract niche borrowers , for example @entity92 wants to lend to small businesses who operate online , where as @entity15 and @entity57 target middle - class people in emerging markets where credit is hard to access			1
but using social data to assess credit risk is on the verge of going mainstream , according to the report			0
@entity57 has began selling its technology to national online lenders in @entity122 and the @entity123 and @entity92 sees itself taking similar steps			2
but the method has its critics			0
@entity127 , a credit expert at @entity129 , claims @entity3 friends are n't necessarily indicative of whether someone will pay back a loan on time			1
where as the more tradition @entity134 considers factors that are all ' incredibly predictive of risk , ' @entity127 said			0
it is also easier for individuals to control their credit score , by ditching dubious friends on @entity3 for example			1
' to me , using social media is a little bit dangerous , ' he said .			0
