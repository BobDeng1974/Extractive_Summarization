by @entity0 published : 03:09 est , 11 september 2012 updated : 03:09 est , 11 september 2012 common painkillers such as ibuprofen increase the risk of dying or having a second heart attack among heart attack survivors , researchers have warned			1
a study shows that taking the common painkillers can put those who have already had one heart attack at a heightened risk of having another for at least five years			1
the findings confirm the potential dangers of taking a group of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs known as @entity17			1
warning : common painkillers such as ibuprofen increase the risk of dying or having a second heart attack among heart attack survivors previous research found the painkillers are linked to a raised risk of heart attacks or stroke when taken in high doses for a long periods of time			1
study leader dr @entity31 - @entity30 , a fellow in the cardiology department at @entity33 in @entity34 , said the study involved prescription drugs , but the widespread availability of ibuprofen in pharmacies was a matter for concern			0
she said : ‘ it is important to get the message out to clinicians taking care of patients with cardiovascular disease that nsaids are harmful , even several years after a heart attack			1
‘ allowing a drug to be sold without prescription must be perceived by the general public as a strong signal of safety , and may be contrary in this case			0
' millions of @entity56 with arthritis are prescribed painkillers , including @entity17 , some of whom have survived heart attacks			2
the researchers used national hospital and pharmacy registries in @entity34 to identify almost 100,000 people 30 or older who had a first heart attack between 1997 and 2009 , and to see if they were prescribed nsaids afterwards			2
the drugs included ibuprofen , sold over the counter in the @entity56 with the brand name @entity73 , naproxen and @entity75			0
almost half of the patients collected at least one @entity17 prescription , says a report in @entity80 , an @entity82 journal			0
among those receiving an @entity17 , risk of death from any cause was 59 per cent higher one year after their heart attack , and 63 per cent higher after five years			1
the risk of having another heart attack or dying from coronary artery disease was 30 per cent higher one year later and 41 per cent higher after five years			1
the findings considered other illnesses and medication use in the @entity17 patients , as well as differences in age , sex , income and year of hospitalisation			0
the study did not look at aspirin , which is frequently recommended by doctors to heart attack survivors			2
dr @entity30 said : ‘ the results support previous findings suggesting that @entity17 have no apparent safe treatment window among heart attack patients , and show that coronary risk related to using the drugs remains high , regardless of the time that has passed since the heart attack			1
’ normally , patients who have a heart attack face higher risk of death or another heart attack within the first year			1
but the extra risk is gone within five to ten years			0
because the new study instead showed a persistently higher risk over at least five years for patients on the drugs , ‘ long - term caution with any use of @entity17 is advised in all patients after heart attack ’ said dr @entity30			1
previous research found two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , ( @entity17 ) ibuprofen and diclofenac , could cause heart attacks when taken in high doses			2
@entity133 is one of the most popular over-the - counter painkillers available from pharmacists and supermarkets - with 46 tons sold here each year			0
@entity137 , senior cardiac nurse at the @entity139 ( @entity139 ) , said : ‘ this study supports what we already know about these painkillers			0
the potential risks mean that this type of drug tends to be prescribed with caution and only taken for short periods			0
‘ it ’s always a good idea to make sure you understand what your medication is for and are aware of any possible side effects			0
if you ’ve had a heart attack , make sure you have a chat with your doctor before taking any extra tablets			2
‘ however , if you ’re a heart attack survivor who has been prescribed these painkillers , do n’t stop taking your medication			2
book an appointment with your gp to talk through any concerns you might have			0

taking anti-inflammatory drugs including @entity133 can put those who have already had one heart attack at a heightened risk of having another for at least five years
