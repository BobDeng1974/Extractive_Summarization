thousands of infertile couples could realise their dreams of becoming parents thanks to a new test that allows ivf treatment to be tailored to a woman 's individual fertility cycle			1
for the first time , scientists believe they are able to identify the point in a woman 's cycle when there is the greatest chance an embryo will successfully implant in the womb			1
repeated rounds of fertility treatment can prove emotionally and financially draining for couples desperate to become parents			2
there are more than 60,000 @entity22 cycles performed in the @entity23 each year			1
yet , just 24 per cent lead to live births			0
meanwhile in the @entity27 , 175,000 @entity22 cycles were performed in 2013 , according to the @entity28			1
there , success rates ranged from 16 to 47 per cent , depending on a woman 's age			1
experts at the @entity35 fertility clinic in @entity36 believe a new test , which identifies the point in a woman 's cycle when there is the greatest chance an embryo will successfully implant , will help thousands of infertile couples realise their dream of becoming parents while the @entity46 offers the treatment , strict guidelines mean many couples are forced to use private clinics , incurring bills that runs into thousands of pounds			1
the current treatment involves doctors performing an ultrasound to check the appearance of the lining of the womb , to assess its general health			0
it is known that for most women , there is a two to four day time period when the lining gives out the key chemical signals that allow the embryo to attach , leading to a pregnancy			2
but a team of scientists , led by professor @entity68 at the @entity35 fertility clinic in @entity36 , said they believe failed attempts often happen because an embryo is implanted at the wrong time , missing a woman 's crucial window of fertility			1
they hope their new study will improve success rates for couples undergoing @entity22 , after they identified a test which can predict each woman 's individual fertility window			1
professor @entity82 , told @entity83 : ' the trial we are currently undertaking is trying to answer if the @entity87 test may help all couples from the first day they attend a fertility clinic , to detect endometrial defects			1
' or , if it will benefit only those with repeated implantation failure as the test does now			0
' my hope is that this test will explain why some women do not get pregnant when good quality embryos are transferred , and thus , avoid repeated @entity22 failure			1
' if we are able to select a good embryo and place in the uterus at the right time , success rates should be significantly higher			2
' these tests are helping us doctors understand why @entity22 can be unsuccessful and ultimately reduce patients ' frustration of unanswered questions			2
' he estimates around 15 per cent of cases of implantation failure ' are simply due to bad timing '			0
he added : ' i think it will make a significant difference in the expectations of couples and how we can explain failures			0
' until now , the endometrium was kind of a black box			0
now we can say this was the problem and this is what we can do about it			0
' the test involves taking a biopsy of a woman 's womb lining			1
experts then analyse 238 genes , allowing them to determine when the woman 's endometrium - the womb lining - will be most receptive to an implanted embryo			1
the test involves taking a biopsy of the womb lining , pictured under a microscope			2
scientists are then able to analyse 238 genes to identify when the lining is at its most receptive and able to accept the embryo			2
a pilot study of 17 women , who had endured failed @entity22 attempts , saw nine become pregnant after the test a case report detailing one woman 's experience , followed by a pilot study involving 17 women , showed success rates were significantly improved after using the test			1
in the pilot study , none of the 17 women had become pregnant despite repeated ( between one and six ) rounds of @entity22 , when traditional techniques were used			1
but after the test was used to determine each woman 's window of implantation , nine of the 17 became pregnant and went on to have a baby			1
it has previously been assumed that the window of implantation was ' constant in all women , ' the researchers note			0
during @entity22 , an egg is surgically removed from a woman 's ovaries and fertilised with sperm in a laboratory			1
the fertilised egg , or embryo , is then returned and implanted back into the woman 's womb to grow and develop			1
embryo transfer is the final part of the treatment process , and as a result women will still have to go through a rigorous treatment programme to reach the point where they may benefit from the new test being trialled by professor @entity68			1
step one a woman is given a drug to suppress her natural menstrual cycle , often in the form of a daily injection or nasal spray , for around two weeks			2
step two a fertility hormone is given , again in the form of a daily injection for between 10 and 12 days			0
it increases the number of eggs a woman produces , to allow experts to collect and fertilise more eggs , to try and improve the success rate			0
step three doctors then monitor the woman and around 34 to 38 hours before her eggs are due to be collected she will be given a final hormone injection that helps your eggs to mature			0
step four for the egg collection a woman is sedated and her eggs are collected using ultrasound as a guide			0
a needle is inserted through the vagina and into each ovary			0
the eggs are then collected through the needle			0
step five the collected eggs are mixed with the woman 's partner 's sperm and after 16 to 20 hours they are checked to see if any have been fertilised			2
if the sperm are few or weak , each egg may need to be injected with individual sperm			0
the fertilised eggs , embryos then continue to grow in the laboratory for one to five days before they are transferred back into the womb			0
once the woman 's eggs have been collected she is given medication , including progesterone , to help prepare the lining of the womb to receive an embryo			1
step six the embryos are transferred back into the woman 's womb			2
it is at this point that the test being trialled by professor @entity68 could be used to determine a woman 's opportune fertility window			1
but their study has instead found that each woman has her own , individual window of implantation , when she can expect the best results from @entity22			2
' understanding the " molecular clock " at play , regardless of the presence or absence of an embryo during the window of implantation could help to identify biomarkers of endometrial receptivity useful to create an objective personalised diagnostic test for this function , ' the researchers said			0
their case report details how a 39 - year - old woman attended the clinic , reporting she had endured two failed attempts at @entity22			1
each round of @entity22 involved the transfer of two good quality embryos that failed to implant and a routine infertility assessment was normal			2
after counselling , the couple decided to pursue further rounds of @entity22			2
but two subsequent rounds proved unsuccessful			0
the next step saw experts giving the woman hormone replacement therapy ( @entity281 ) as well as progesterone replacement			0
three days after ovulation , triggered by the hormone therapy , another attempt failed			0
another attempt five days after hormone therapy also proved unsuccessful			0
despite the repeated failure , the couple remained determined to become pregnant			0
the researchers then attempted to diagnose the woman 's window of implantation , using the endometrial receptivity array test ( @entity87 )			1
the test is based on the expression of 238 genes that are related to how receptive the womb lining is , established after a biopsy			0
' the test identifies " personalised " window of implantation in women with recurrent implantation failure , ' the report said			0
the team took a biopsy of the woman 's womb lining five days after hormone therapy - the point at which the previous attempt had failed			1
it revealed her ' endometrium was pre-receptive ' , leading them to conclude they had been implanting the embryo too early			0
the report notes : ' a two - day displacement of her window of implantation was diagnosed , and this determined the need to repeat the @entity87 test in a further @entity281 cycle after seven days of progesterone replacement			0
' as a result , two embyros were implanted at the key seven - day point , after progesterone replacement , and the woman became pregnant with twins			2
the pregnancy was uneventful and twins boys were delivered by caesarean section at 36 weeks			0
a pilot study followed with 17 patients taking part			1
each had suffered between one and six implantation failures			0
the researchers diagnosed each woman 's window of implantation and instead of routine embryo transfer , each woman underwent implantation according to her cycle			1
of the women taking part nine became pregnant and gave birth			2
for one of the 17 women , six rounds of @entity22 had previously failed			1
yet after performing the test , the researchers discovered all previous implantation attempts had been two days premature			0
after two further rounds of @entity22 , based on her individual cycle , the woman became pregnant and gave birth to her baby			1
professor @entity82 is now leading a clinical trial of the test , with around 2,500 women who have suffered two or more failed attempts , in more than 10 countries taking part .			1

experts at the @entity35 fertility clinic believe a new test could transform @entity22
test *pinpoints* the point in a woman 's cycle when there is the best chance an embryo will successfully implant and she will become pregnant
in the @entity23 more than 60,000 ivf cycles are performed each year
but just 24 *%* are successful leading to emotional and financial stress
pilot study of 17 women , who suffered up to six failed rounds of @entity22 each , saw nine become pregnant and have babies after the test was performed
trial of 2,500 women in 10 countries is now taking place , scientists said
