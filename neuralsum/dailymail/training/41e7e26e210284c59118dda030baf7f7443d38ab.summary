by @entity0 , science reporter published : 06:28 est , 28 december 2012 updated : 05:00 est , 29 december 2012 healthy appetite : @entity4 actress january @entity3 came under fire for eating her own placenta in the form of dried pills when it comes to dishing out advise on health and wellbeing , maybe celebrities should just stick to their day jobs			2
from @entity15 carrying around inhalable bottles of oxygen to tackle tiredness and stress , to actress @entity20 rubbing coffee granules into her skin to prevent cellulite , stars are more prone than most to questionable fads			1
now scientists are hitting back and debunking the outlandish claims which are often lapped up by the public			2
in a report , the charity @entity28 has named and shamed actors , singers and sports personalities guilty of peddling ' dubious ' scientific theories			2
they also list five ' misleading ' terms celebrities should avoid in 2013 as they mean very little - immune boosting , detox , superfood , oxygenating and cleansing			2
and in an @entity40 year , one of 2012 's most popular fads was seen adorning the legs , backs and buttocks of athletes - coloured sports tape			2
footballer @entity46 , tennis players @entity48 and @entity50 , and @entity52 sprinter @entity51 all used the @entity54 strapping , which comes in a variety of shades , to help with injuries			2
developed by a @entity60 doctor more than 30 years ago , the adhesive tape is designed to provide muscle and joint support without restricting movement			2
but sports scientist professor @entity64 said : ' the manufacturers ... claim placement of the tape on the skin reduces pain and swelling in injured muscles			1
it 's unclear how this can positively affect inflammation deep within the muscle			2
' he added : ' that said			2
this tape could have added placebo effect '			0
in 2011 , @entity15 championed vitamin injections , but this year the media mogul has opted for pocket - sized oxygen shots to get his health fix			1
according to reports , @entity15 - also an aficionado of botox - is convinced inhaling the gas can reduce the signs of tiredness , stress and ageing			1
@entity92 , from the centre for @entity90 and @entity91 , warned ' breathing pure oxygen can cause collapse of lung air sacs - this could make you more susceptible to lung infections '			1
you can trust @entity15 to discover the @entity99 in showbusiness , but when it comes to reliable health advice perhaps one should look elsewhere			1
the @entity104 supremo , who last year championed vitamin injections , apparently carries small bottles of oxygen with him convinced that inhaling the gas can reduce the signs of tiredness , stress and ageing			1
actress @entity20 's home - made cure for cellulite involves rubbing coffee granules into her skin			1
but pharmaceutical scientist dr @entity115 is not convinced			0
he says that while ' caffeine may have an effect , the coffee granules wo n't ...			1
for any chance of seeing an effect from such a small amount of caffeine you would need to be rubbing coffee into your skin all day			1
' the @entity128 striker is one of many sportsmen to use @entity54 strapping , developed by a @entity60 doctor to provide muscle and joint support without restricting movement			0
the tape , which comes in a range of colours is supposed to help with injuries			0
scientists however remain unconvinced with a common view being that the tape might have , at best , a placebo effect			0
the @entity145 actress apparently believes that children would better understand where their emotions come from if they were taught about the functions of the @entity149 in a scathing put down , neuroscientist professor @entity143 said such an idea would work be no more effective than ' understanding the chemical components of a ball would help them to kick it better '			0
earlier this year , @entity145 star @entity155 claimed her mobile phone may have been to blame for a benign brain @entity159 singer said she used to spend hours chatting away on ' archaic old cell phones			1
' but dr @entity161 from @entity162 said : ' the evidence to date is clear that short term use of mobile phones is not linked to brain cancer '			1
@entity15 also featured in the report for announcing on @entity168 that he had ' someone heal me house			1
the healer brings in good energy '			0
actress @entity20 's home - made cure for cellulite includes coffee granules			1
but pharmaceutical scientist dr @entity115 says that while ' caffeine may have an effect , the coffee granules wo n't ...			1
for any chance of seeing an effect from such a small amount of caffeine you would need to be rubbing coffee into your skin all day			1
' @entity190 came under fire for eating her own placenta in the form of dried pills , following the birth of her son			0
@entity199 , principal dietician at @entity200 , said : ' nutritionally , there 's little to be gained from eating your placenta - raw , cooked or dried			0
' earlier this year , singer @entity155 claimed her mobile phone may have been to blame for a benign brain tumour , saying ' i do have a theory that it 's possible that it 's related to that , i used to spend hours on the archaic old cell phones			1
' but dr @entity161 from @entity162 said : ' the evidence to date is clear that short term use of mobile phones is not linked to brain cancer '			1
@entity28 also took exception to chancellor @entity215 saying the @entity216 was giving the economy ' 110 per cent ' of its attention			0
@entity219 , the former director of straight statists , said : ' you ca n't have 110 per cent of anything ...			0
it 's nonsense to anybody with any feeling for numbers			0
' helpful contribution : @entity229 @entity228 said he was a pragmatic cynic and believer in ' hardcore medicine and science ' the charity did congratulate a handful of celebrities for making a helpful contribution and ' talking sense ' on food fads , vitamin supplements and alternative therapies			0
@entity229 @entity228 was praised for his comments in the @entity242 last month debunking alternative medicine			0
the former @entity245 frontman said : ' i 've tried acupuncture ... but i 'm a pragmatic cynic and believe hardcore medicine and science should be your first port of call before you deviate to other things , otherwise your life could be at risk			0
' science writer @entity255 said it is ' right to highlight the value of " hardcore " medicine , which simply means that the treatment has been tested and shown to be effective			0
' cricketer @entity261 was also commended after telling the @entity242 that food supplements are mostly superfluous , saying ' you can get enough out of your diet '			0
@entity266 , the managing director of @entity28 said : ' we seem to be seeing a celebrity divide on science			0
the implausible and frankly dangerous claims about how to avoid cancer , improve skin or lose weight are becoming ever more ridiculous			2
on the other hand , this year we have had more examples than ever sent to us of people in the public eye who clearly do check their facts			0
