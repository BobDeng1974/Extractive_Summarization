they look innocent enough but these four , every - day items wreak havoc on the average couple ’s sex life			1
banish them from your bedroom and you ’re instantly in store for a year of better , more frequent sex ! your tv couples who have a tv in their bedroom have sex half as often as those who do n’t : that ’s a fact , supported by reputable research			1
why ? it stops you both talking , it robs you of sleep ( the better rested we are , the healthier and higher our libido ) and it keeps you grounded in reality			2
by keeping your laptop or @entity23 in your bedroom you destroy intimacy and distract from sex @entity27 help us all , but reality shows like the @entity34 's suck some people into the trap of thinking what we watch on telly is actually real			2
sex on telly is peppered with couples having more simultaneous orgasms than cups of tea			0
in real life , they ’re actually pretty rare			0
@entity44 says that in order to have the best sex possible it is wise to choose a firmer bed all of this leads to unrealistic expectations and constant disappointment with our sex lives			1
your ipads and phones ditching the telly wo n’t do a thing if you replace it with another device to distract you from sex and each other			0
slip into bed and pull out your ipad or phone and the effect on your relationship is even worse ! these gadgets are portable , so capable of destroying intimacy anywhere			1
foreplay should begin way before you take your clothes off and if your partner ’s spent all night on their phone , giving other people attention , why would you want to give them yours ? one recent study found it ’s especially harmful if one person uses technology more than the other - the second person feels ignored and insecure			0
neither are emotions likely to trigger a bit of rumpy - pumpy			0
a soft , @entity86 the best beds for good sex are firm with no hard edges			0
you need a firm foundation to master creative sex positions and to be able to sit or lean on the edges without hitting anything hard			0
clean , fresh linen is inviting ; scratchy , balled - up sheets , not so much ( though there is something undeniably sexy about a crumpled bed that you both have just had sex in ! )			2
a few firm pillows are perfect for lifting and supporting body bits to make sex super comfy and those more adventurous positions more ‘ doable ’			2
@entity104 well - worn , snuggly track pants and wooly socks might make us feel cosy when it ’s cold outside , but they do little to get your partner hot and bothered			1
i ’m not suggesting tottering to bed in high heels and sexy stay - up stockings on monday nights but aiming for a happy medium by choosing something that ’s at least a little flattering is n’t too much to ask , surely ? check out traceycox.com for more advice , @entity44 's books and product range .			1
