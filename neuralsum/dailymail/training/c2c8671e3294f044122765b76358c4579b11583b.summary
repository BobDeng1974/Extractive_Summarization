@entity0 could stay in charge of @entity2 until at least the end of the season should he impress over the coming two matches			1
the caretaker boss would love the chance to prove his worth at the helm of his hometown club and will communicate as much to owner @entity11 , with whom he has a good relationship			0
@entity0 fits the bill of ' head coach ' which the club are looking to appoint and he is popular within the dressing room			0
@entity0 could take over at @entity2 until at least the end of the season the caretaker boss - pictured here with @entity21 - has been involved with the club since the early nineties his future could well be determined by the outcome of matches against @entity27 on @entity28 and the @entity30 tie at @entity31 48 hours later			1
but with @entity2 in the relative comfort of mid-table , there is a feeling that @entity11 could take a chance on someone like @entity0 until the end of the campaign , especially if efforts to bring in an external candidate prove troublesome			2
the 49 - year - old has served on and off at the club in a coaching capacity since the early nineties having been a reserve - team player with the @entity46 before injury curtailed his career			2
@entity49 has said his goodbyes to the players and staff at @entity2 ahead of his @entity54 move @entity56 boss @entity55 has quashed any suggestions that he will be replacing @entity49 at @entity2 @entity55 , meanwhile , appears to have ruled himself out of the running for the position at @entity60 , although were an approach forthcoming that stance could well change			1
@entity64 boss @entity63 is thought to be another name the @entity2 hierarchy are considering			0
any appointment , however , is not expected until next week at the earliest .			0

@entity49 is *finalising* a move to take over as manager of @entity54
@entity0 is currently in caretaker charge of @entity2
he could be there until at least the end of the season if he impresses
@entity0 has been involved with @entity2 since the early nineties
