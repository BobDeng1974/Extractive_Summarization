twenty - six @entity1 women who claim to be having affairs with a priest have written to @entity4 begging him to lift the @entity7 clergy 's vow of celibacy			1
in an extraordinary letter addressed to his holiness , the unnamed women say they are just a ' small sample ' of believers being forced to ' live in silence ' because of their relationship			1
the letter starts : ' @entity19 , we are a group of women from all over @entity1 ( and further afield ) and are writing to you to break down the wall of silence and indifference that we are faced with every day			1
a group of women have called on @entity4 to life the church 's vow of celibacy			1
he is pictured here in @entity33 , @entity34 ' each of us is in , was or would like to start a relationship with a priest we are in love with			2
' the 26 women signed with just their name and the initial letter of their surname , plus the name of their hometown , but they did write their surnames and telephone numbers on the envelope			1
' as you are well aware , ' the letter reads , ' a lot has been said by those who are in favour of optional celibacy but very little is known about the devastating suffering of a woman who is deeply in love with a priest			2
' we humbly place our suffering at your feet in the hope that something may change , not just for us , but for the good of the entire @entity65			0
' ' we love these men , they love us , and in most cases , despite all efforts to renounce it , one can not manage to give up such a solid and beautiful bond			0
' unfortunately , this brings with it all the pain of not being able " to live it fully "			1
this continuous giving and then letting go is soul destroying			0
the unnamed women say they are just a ' small sample ' of believers being forced to ' live in silence ' because of their relationship ( file picture ) pope @entity4 arrives in @entity33 for his inaugural mass at the @entity84 ' when this enormous pain leads to a definitive separation , the consequences are no less devastating and both parties are often scarred for life			1
the only other alternatives are either for the priest to abandon the priesthood or for the relationship to carry on in secret			0
' in the first scenario , the dramatic situation the couple is faced causes enormous suffering to both parties : we would also like the men we love to live their priestly vocation fully , serving the community and continue the mission they have been passionately and devotedly engaged in for a great many years			2
' we wish to stand by their side and support them in their calling which is strengthened by the vital force of love they discovered with us			0
' ' the second scenario , that is , when the couple chooses to continue a relationship in secret , involves living one ’s life in a constant state of hiding , frustrated by an incomplete love , with no hope of childbearing ; a love that can not see the light of day			0
' it may sound like a hypocritical situation , remaining celibate but keeping one ’s companion secret			0
unfortunately , however , this is often the only and painful choice that has to be made because of the impossibility of giving up such a strong love that is rooted in the @entity134			0
' about 6,000 @entity1 men have left the priesthood to marry , compared with a total of 33,000 parish priests now in service			0
the @entity4 has previously supported the tradition of celibacy , but has suggested his position might waiver			1
' for now , i am in favour of maintaining celibacy , with all the pros and cons that come with it , because in 10 centuries there have been more positive experiences than errors , ' he was quoted saying in 2010 , before he became @entity4 , in the book , on @entity152			1
the @entity153 has disclosed he had a girlfriend in @entity155 as a young man before choosing to become a priest			0
he has argued that celibacy is more @entity65 tradition than hard and fast doctrine , pointing out that , up until the year 1100 , some priests choose it while others did not .			2
