by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 07:45 est , 2 may 2013 updated : 18:01 est , 2 may 2013 acknowledging the uncertainty that lies ahead , president @entity3 said thursday that the @entity5 will cooperate with @entity6 in fighting drug - trafficking and organized crime in any way @entity6 's government deems appropriate			1
he recommitted the @entity5 to fighting the demand for illegal drugs and the flow of illegal guns across the border with @entity6 even as the southern neighbor rethinks how much access it gives to @entity5 security agencies			2
' i agreed to continue our close cooperation on security , even as the nature of that cooperation will evolve , ' @entity3 said at a joint news conference with @entity6 president @entity26			1
' it is obviously up to the @entity6 people to determine their security structures and how it engages with other nations â€” including the @entity5			2
' arrival : president @entity3 waves as he arrives to @entity35 in @entity36 , thursday agenda : to sell his immigration overhaul back home , @entity3 ( center ) needs a growing economy in @entity6 and a @entity6 president willing to help him secure the border shaking hands : @entity5 president @entity3 ( right ) and his @entity6 counterpart @entity26 shake hands as the president arrives in @entity36 @entity3 's remarks come as @entity50 , in a dramatic shift from his predecessor , has moved to end the widespread access that @entity5 security agencies have had in @entity6 to help fight drug - trafficking and organized crime			1
the @entity57 has been cautious in its public response to the changes , with the president and his advisers saying they need to hear directly from the @entity6 leader before making a judgment about the new arrangement			2
@entity50 , speaking at the news conference in @entity67 , downplayed the notion that the new arrangement would mean less close cooperation with the @entity5			0
' there is no clash between these two goals , ' he said			0
he said @entity3 had said the @entity5 will ' cooperate on the basis of mutual respect ' to promote an efficient security strategy			2
the two leaders met thursday at @entity6 's @entity78 on the first day of @entity3 's three - day trip to @entity6 and @entity80			1
to sell his immigration overhaul back home , @entity3 needs a growing economy in @entity6 and a @entity6 president willing to help him secure the border			1
he arrived in @entity36 eager to promote @entity6 's economic success and the neighboring country 's place as the second largest export market for @entity5 goods and services			2
@entity6 will be hanging on the @entity5 president 's words , but @entity3 also has in mind an important audience back in the @entity5			1
though the role played by @entity101 voters in last year 's @entity5 presidential election gets much credit for the current momentum for potentially changing immigration laws and providing a path to citizenship for 11 million immigrants in the @entity5 illegally , another reason for the change in attitudes is that stronger border protections and the recession have been disincentives to cross into the @entity5 tour : president @entity3 ( @entity113 ) gets a tour of the @entity78 in @entity36 from @entity6 president @entity26 ( right ) meeting : @entity5 president @entity3 ( @entity113 ) and @entity6 president @entity26 make their way to their seats for a bilateral meeting cruising : the presidential limousine with president @entity3 inside drives past the @entity120 in @entity36 's main plaza , the @entity122 as a result , illegal immigration has declined			1
' with @entity6 , first and foremost , they are critical to our ability to secure the border , ' said @entity129 , an @entity3 deputy national security adviser			1
' all the immigration plans that have been contemplated put a focus on securing the border as an essential priority and starting point for immigration reform			0
' even better than a strong border is an economy that keeps people from fleeing			0
' if the @entity6 economy is growing , it forestalls the need for people to migrate to the @entity5 to find work , ' @entity129 added			1
eager to focus on the economy and immigration , the administration is downplaying @entity26 's recent steps to end the broad access @entity6 gave @entity5 security agencies to help fight drug trafficking and organized crime under his predecessor , @entity152			1
still , the changes are likely to be a subject during the two leaders ' private talks			0
@entity26 took office in december , and for @entity3 the trip is an opportunity to take his measure of the @entity6 leader early in his tenure			1
' it 's really important to go there while this new president is forming his own plans and judgments about what he 's going to do about the border , about where he 's going to be on immigration , about where he is on trade , ' @entity164 president / ceo @entity163 said in an interview			2
the chamber long has worked to improve @entity5 - @entity6 trade , noting that now about 6 million @entity5 jobs depend on commerce with @entity6			0
drugs : a @entity6 federal police officer stands next to packages , believed to be marijuana			0
the administration is downplaying @entity26 's recent steps to end the broad access @entity6 gave @entity5 security agencies to help fight drug trafficking striking the right note on border security is key , @entity163 said , because it is a central to winning support in @entity193 for the rest of the immigration legislation			1
' that 's what everybody wants to hear , and we have to do that in a way that makes these guys down there feel like we 're doing it in conjunction with them and for them , so we can do this thing on immigration well , so we can expand our trade , so we can deal with our political issues as they are trying to deal with theirs , ' @entity163 said			0
still , with 33 million @entity5 residents of @entity6 origin , @entity3 's message in @entity6 is also bound to resonate in the @entity5 , where @entity217 could increase pressure on @entity193 to act			2
' it helps keep these passions alive as far as an issue to promote for the administration , ' said @entity223 , a former senior @entity224 adviser on the @entity225			0
but @entity223 , now director of the @entity228 program at the @entity229 , cautioned that despite some bipartisan support to create a path to citizenship in the immigration bill , there is skepticism in @entity224			0
' they 've been brought to the altar so many times by different @entity5 administrations that there 's a little bit of a lack of trust , ' he said			0
for @entity26 , @entity3 's visit is a chance for him to showcase his country 's economic gains			0
after suffering along with the @entity5 during the recession , its economy is now growing at a better clip than that of the @entity5 per capita income has gone from an annual $ 7,900 two years ago to $ 10,146 .			0
