survivor : @entity0 , 70 , was staying in a @entity2 guest house when the tsunami wave swept in			1
above , he returns to the beach to remember as @entity0 walked along the baking sandy beach in the popular southern @entity2 resort of @entity7 his thoughts focused on a decade earlier and the day he feared he would die , swept away near the same spot by the power of the tsunami wave			1
‘ it was going to be the perfect day , ’ the 70 year - old psycho therapist recalled , ‘ the weather had been unusually good and it was a holiday for local people so we were expecting it to be just perfect			1
’ mr @entity0 and his wife @entity18 were staying in a room on the first floor of a guest house , set among palm trees and protected by a small hotel 50 - metres from the beach at @entity7 , a resort popular with @entity26 tourists close to the southern city of @entity28			1
‘ it was 9.20am and i was still in my room when i heard a noise just as i was getting up , ’ he said , ‘ i thought it was a bus but it was too loud ... maybe a helicopter			1
‘ i went out on to the balcony and my wife was there			1
we could see a dark line in the water and this loud , thunderous noise			0
we stood and watched as the water came in relentlessly , powerfully			0
’ people who were on the beach were screaming and running for their lives , others were desperately trying the cling on to palm trees or make it to the highest point in surrounding buildings			1
‘ the water came over the sand , picking up fishing boats and sun loungers , washing them across the road and sending them crashing into buildings and cars			0
the power was so great that one of the boats side - swiped a bungalow demolishing it			2
‘ i knew it was a tsunami and i thought “ @entity67 , this must be a big one ”			1
i was calculating mentally as the water was rising and we went to the back of the house to see if it was possible to go higher			2
‘ i remember thinking it was ironic that i was going to die here on holiday … if the water kept rising , i would die			2
it was a seven or eight metre wall and it just swept on			2
‘ we could hear buildings collapsing , objects crashing in to one another , the cries of desperate people and animals			0
‘ our building was made of reinforced concrete but walls around us were punched out by the water			0
‘ i began to take photographs , i thought that if i died there i wanted people to know how and why i died			2
it had reached the first floor and our room but then suddenly stopped rising			2
‘ the power of the water was just incredible			0
people were in quite a lot of distress – as the water was going down they were being towed out to sea together with all kind of debris			0
‘ a @entity104 couple sleeping on the ground floor after partying the night before were blown out of bed by the water and ended up stark naked hanging on to palm trees			0
devastation : schoolchildren walk among what is left of the school buildings that once stood in the southern @entity2 town of @entity7			1
mr @entity0 was staying in the popular resort when the tsunami swept in ‘ people were being pulled screaming out of the water , they were clinging for dear life to anything they could lay their hands on that was fixed to the ground			1
‘ we saw a young girl being swept away and shouted for her to hang on the gate post			2
‘ we stayed on the balcony for another house			2
there was a @entity132 woman going in to deep shock			0
her partner had gone for a walk and was missing			0
he turned up eventually covered in mud , cuts and debris			0
’ mr @entity0 , from @entity139 , @entity140 , continued : ‘ we went down stairs and it was almost unrecognisable			1
the road was full of water that was knee - height			2
‘ we picked our way through glass , dead dogs , filth			0
it looked like @entity151 after taking major mortar fire			0
there was so much devastation			0
the bay was full of rubbish , the coral had been trashed and was floating about , a fridge - freezer was floating by			0
’ they made their way to the @entity160 , one of the buildings that had survived with little damage and joined 200 others			0
‘ there was a lot of panic , a lot of anxiety , ’ mr @entity0 said			1
‘ there was a bit of aftershock and one much smaller wave			0
‘ on a beach nearby a @entity175 couple had lost their baby … almost everyone in the village had lost someone			0
’ days later , the @entity104 were evacuated by the @entity104 @entity182 but within three months mr @entity0 had returned to help local schools and village vendors			1
recovery : along @entity7 beach , pictured above , there are still some reminders of the day when the tsunami struck			1
mr @entity0 returned this year to take part in a memorial service held there on @entity193 he was back again for the first anniversary where tens of thousands of traditional clay oil lamps were lit on the beach in memory of those who died – a memorial repeated this @entity193			1
along @entity7 there are still some reminders of that dreadful day a decade ago from the waterlines marked on walls and three 25ft above sea level to the clock on a popular beachfront hotel and bar wall which stopped at 9.27am when it was washed from the wall			1
the clock has been hung again but the time remains untouched			0
in the room where mr @entity0 feared he would die as he watched the water rise and rise , there is a mark he made on the wall of his first floor room when it was at its highest			1
each year he returns to the same room and remembers .			1

@entity0 from @entity140 was in @entity2 on @entity193 in 2004
he was with his wife in a guest house near the beach at popular resort
when tsunami wave swept in the 70 - year - old thought he was going to die
each year he returns to the same room and remembers the tragic day
