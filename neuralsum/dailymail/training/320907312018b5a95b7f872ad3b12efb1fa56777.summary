by @entity0 published : 12:51 est , 23 august 2012 updated : 02:02 est , 24 august 2012 a controversial blood test for prostate cancer may have significantly improved the survival prospects of patients diagnosed with advanced disease , research has shown			1
scientists identified a reduced risk of dying of almost a third since the widespread introduction of the @entity10 ( prostate specific antigen ) test in the late 1980s and early 1990s			1
the @entity10 test identifies a protein in the blood that can signify the presence of prostate cancer			1
prostate cancer cells : researchers say the @entity10 test can cut deaths , even though it is not used routinely in the @entity20 or @entity21 critics say the test is too unreliable to be used for routine screening , which is why there is no automatic @entity10 testing in the @entity20			1
instead , it is used on a case by case basis with men who exhibit symptoms			0
but the new @entity33 study suggests that widespread @entity10 testing can save lives			2
the test is used more often in the @entity21 than the @entity20 , though the @entity37 no longer recommends it for routine screening			2
scientists studied survival data from prostate cancer trials conducted before and after @entity10 testing was introduced in 1987			1
in the two earlier trials , which enrolled patients between 1985 and 1994 , typical patient survival was 30 and 33 months			0
by the time the later trial was conducted , between 1995 and 2009 , survival had increased to 49 months			0
the risk of death had reduced by around 30 %			0
all the patients had newly diagnosed advanced cancer that had spread to the bones and were receiving hormone deprivation therapy			0
between the earlier and later trials the survival gap between @entity33 and @entity55 men with prostate cancer narrowed			1
@entity33 survival rose from 27 months to 48 months			0
men of @entity33 descent are more likely to be diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer than white men			1
study leader professor @entity63 , from the @entity64 at @entity65 , said : ' our analysis indicates an overall improvement in risk adjusted survival rates for @entity72 men			0
the @entity10 test uses a simple blood test to look for a key indicator of prostate cancer ' of note is the resolution of disparity in survival between the races found in earlier studies			1
' while not all of these welcome improvements can be attributed strictly to @entity10 testing , without a doubt it has played a role in extending many lives			2
' the research is published in the @entity90			0
previous studies have suggested that @entity10 testing saves few lives and in many cases can lead to risky and unnecessary treatments .			2

@entity10 test not used routinely in the @entity20 because of fears over *reliability*
can spot a protein in the blood that can signify the presence of prostate cancer
