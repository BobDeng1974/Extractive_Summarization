by @entity0 published : 04:58 est , 8 october 2012 updated : 06:03 est , 8 october 2012 @entity2 scientists have launched a tiny satellite that will twinkle like an artificial star to write messages across the sky that can be visible from @entity7			1
the 4in - square @entity9 - 1 - nicknamed @entity8 - was one of a group of unassuming cubesats recently put into orbit by astronauts aboard the @entity15			2
the tiny orbiter 's mission is to broadcast the message ' hi this is @entity19 ' in @entity20 , using bursts of intense light to draw the dots and dashes across the heavens			1
tiny : the 4in - square , 3lb @entity9 - 1 seen from the top , left , and bottom , right			1
it will broadcast the message ' hi this is @entity19 ' spelled out in @entity20 across the heavens using high - powered @entity31 message from the heavens : this artist 's impression shows the message that @entity8 will write across the night sky using high - power @entity31 driven by pulses of energy as high as @entity40 will produce flashes of light so bright its makers hope it will be observable with the naked eye or with small binoculars			1
@entity8 was one of three cubesats launched from the @entity15 last thursday and the team behind it say all initial indications show that it is working normally			2
it was originally planned to appear only over @entity19 , but a flurry of interest means that it will now be touring the entire globe			1
launch successful : @entity8 was launched along with two other cubesats from the @entity15 last thursday using high - power @entity31 driven by pulses of energy as high as @entity9 will produce flashes of light so bright its makers hope it will be observable with the naked eye or with small binoculars @entity8 had been originally expected to transmit over @entity19 , but thanks to a flurry of interest it will now be touring the globe the @entity15 is planning to change its orbit after narrowly avoiding two pieces of space junk last month			1
a broken @entity71 satellite and the remains of an @entity74 rocket passed within miles of the @entity15 , with the station primed to move and the astronauts having a tense few hours wondering if disaster was about to strike			2
now , the @entity71 space program 's @entity78 says it will move the @entity15 into a different orbit to lower the risk of possible collisions			0
there is ' no practical aim ' to the morse code beacons , according to its creator , professor @entity86 of the @entity87 , except to test the possibility of optical communication from space			0
the @entity9 - 1 team say it will try to fulfil all requests for appearances			0
however , despite the brightness of its leds it can not be seen through heavy cloud cover , so skywatchers should hope for a clear night if they hope to see it passing above their part of the world			2
the 3lb satellite 's main mission is to test a high - speed data transmitter which will beam vga images taken by an onboard camera back to @entity7			0
scientists believe their transmitter can send a 480x640 jpeg within 6 seconds			0
@entity9 - 1 will orbit the earth between 51.6 degrees south latitude and 51.6 degrees north latitude and it will carry a mounted neodymium magnet to force it to always point to magnetic north like a compass			0
more information on the @entity8 can be found on its information page on the @entity87 's website .			0

tiny orbiter will write ' hi this is @entity19 ' across the heavens
it will tour the globe to skywatchers worldwide can see its message
