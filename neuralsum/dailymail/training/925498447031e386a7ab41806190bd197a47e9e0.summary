by @entity0 in a series of images from @entity5 ’s @entity4 , a white dot appears to descend to the surface of the @entity7			1
the images are claimed by one @entity9 to be evidence of a @entity12 landing on the red planet			1
but , says @entity5 , the anomaly can be easily explained as a so - called ' hot pixel ' in one of the cameras			1
in reality , according to an imaging scientist at @entity5 , it is more than likely just a hot pixel , which is an anomaly in the camera that can happen during long exposure pictures claims of aliens on @entity7 are nothing new - many previous supposed sightings have been made			1
hot pixels appear in a photograph as bright spots that are out of place when compared to the rest of the image			0
they are caused by camera sensors getting hot during long exposure images			2
with regards to the @entity4 , they often appear in images taken on @entity7			1
they are also different from ' dead ' pixels , which are permanently damaged pixels that receive no power			0
this latest ‘ discovery ’ was taking by the two cameras on the mast of the rover , its head and neck , known as @entity54 and @entity21			0
the images were taken by the rover on 20 june , 665 @entity7 days since @entity4 first landed on @entity7 in august 2012			1
the white light appears to move downwards , suggesting it is moving towards the surface , in two images separated by 31 seconds			2
in the first image from @entity21 right the white light is above a mountain			0
but the next image from @entity54 shows it is closer to the ground			0
@entity68 boldly claims in a video that it is a sign of a @entity12 arriving on @entity7			2
in the images the light appears to be moving downards , but it 's likely just a hot pixel in one ' eye ' of the camera and a cosmic ray in the other			1
the first image ( left ) was taken by @entity21 and the second ( right ) was taken by @entity54 31 seconds later on 20 june , a few days before @entity4 celebrated its ' anniversary ' but speaking to the @entity84 , imaging scientist dr @entity83 from @entity5 explained what they thought the anomaly was			1
the rover 's top speed is 1.5 inches ( 3.8 centimetres ) per second			0
curiosity is the fourth rover to visit @entity7			2
it took around seven minutes to land on the @entity7			2
the rover is fitted with 17 cameras			0
it weighs about the same as a @entity96 at approximately 2,000lb ( 900kg )			0
scientists considered 60 possible landing sites before deciding on @entity99			0
‘ this is a hot pixel that has been around since we started using the @entity21 , ’ he said			2
a hot pixel can show up when sensors get hot during long exposures			1
the reason for a similar white dot in the other image is apparently a coincidence , @entity5 tells @entity111 , caused by a cosmic ray or another anomaly			1
other ‘ lights ’ in the past have been attributed to sunlight glinting off rocks or cosmic rays striking the surface			0
@entity5 also points out that these image artifacts , including hot pixels and cosmic rays , are relatively common and can be noticed in many other images taken by @entity4			1
curiosity has been operational on @entity7 since august 2012 and is now on its way to @entity126			0
this ' find ' came a few days before @entity4 celebrated a @entity7 year - 687 @entity128 days - on 24 june , having accomplished the mission 's main goal of determining whether @entity7 once could support life one infamous false claim of @entity12 in the past was the ‘ face on @entity7			1
’ on 25 july 1976 @entity5 ’s @entity135 orbiter released an image of a region called @entity138 that seemed to show a human face on the @entity7			1
in reality it was nothing more than a phenomenon known as pareidolia , where the human brain picks out faces in an object , in this instance a chance aligning of shifting sand			0
in 2006 , the @entity151 ( @entity151 ) imaged the region and again and showed that the sand had continued shifting , erasing the ‘ face ’ from the surface			0
in 1976 the @entity135 orbiter snapped an image of a region of @entity7 that looked like a human face ( left ) , leading some to claim it was a sign of intelligent life , but 30 years later it was proven to just be a sand dune ( right )			0

two images seem to show a white dot descending to the surface of @entity7
@entity5 , however , explains how they can be attributed to hot pixel anomaly
one @entity9 had claimed the images showed a @entity12 landing on the planet
the images were taken by cameras on @entity4 on 20 june
this was just a week before @entity4 celebrated its first @entity7 year
