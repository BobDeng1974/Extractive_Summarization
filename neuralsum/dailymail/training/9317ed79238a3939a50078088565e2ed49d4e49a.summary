@entity1 traffic supremo calls for ' graduated ' licences to curb motorway driving , reduce the number of passengers they can carry , and cut their insurance bills by @entity7 last updated at 10:56 pm on 3rd december 2011 shake - up : @entity9 newly qualified drivers would be barred from motorways and forbidden from driving at night under changes being demanded by the country ’s most senior traffic police officer			1
novices would also face limits on how many passengers they may carry , and would be forced to display the currently optional ‘ p ’ plate – which shows a driver has only recently passed the test			1
the changes are part of a ‘ graduated ’ licence scheme proposed by deputy chief constable @entity9 , which would effectively place new drivers on probation and subject them to extra rules for a period , after which they would receive a full licence free of the restrictions			1
miss @entity9 , who works for @entity31 , is in charge of roads policing at the @entity1 ( @entity1 ) and is the first woman to be appointed to the position			1
while young drivers may object to the new rules , they will welcome the cheaper insurance experts say will result from the measures			1
the move would bring @entity41 into line with other countries and could save hundreds of lives			2
miss @entity9 , 48 , who took up the @entity1 post six weeks ago , says she experienced ‘ the ruin and havoc ’ road accidents cause while working as a traffic officer			1
every day , an average of two people die and 16 others are injured in road crashes involving drivers under 25			0
one in four people killed or seriously maimed in crashes is a young driver or is a passenger driven by one			0
miss @entity9 told the @entity59 : ‘ at the moment , people learn to drive mainly in calm residential streets when it ’s light			0
they do n’t have much experience of driving on busy a-roads or in the dark			2
safety drive : new drivers will be forced to display ' p ' plates ' yet as soon as they get a licence they can drive on motorways at speed and carry as many passengers as they like			1
the vast majority are responsible but some – especially young people – take risks and drive too quickly			0
i am enthusiastic about graduated licences and i would like to put some constraints on new drivers			1
’ she is also calling for all drivers to be banned from drinking any alcohol at all and for drivers caught using mobiles , laptops or other electronic devices to be prosecuted			0
miss @entity9 has promised to raise the subject of graduated licences with ministers at the @entity90 next month			1
‘ the scheme needs further work on exactly how it would operate , but my view to @entity94 is that this needs exploring , ’ she said			0
safety risk : according to @entity97 , some young drivers take risks and drive too quickly ( posed by model ) but if the graduated licence is to be adopted , she will have to persuade roads minister @entity102 to change his mind			2
the @entity104 mp has claimed restrictions for new drivers unfairly penalise those who rely on driving to get to work or college			2
graduated licences already exist in @entity107 , @entity108 and parts of the @entity110			1
@entity112 researchers estimate a graduated driving licence for 17 to 19 - year - olds in @entity41 could cut road deaths by 200 a year and serious injuries by 1,700			1
the high number of accidents that involve newly qualified drivers has pushed up insurance costs for those aged 17 to 24			1
premiums are up to £ 6,000 a year , often more than the value of a vehicle			0
the high cost can tempt the young to drive uninsured			0
the @entity126 estimates there are 400,000 drivers aged under 30 on @entity41 ’s roads			0
the @entity130 ( @entity130 ) believes the graduated licence could result in cheaper premiums			2
a spokesman said : ‘ if young drivers had controls on their behaviour after the test , we believe that safety would improve , accidents come down , and premiums follow			0
’ at present , when someone passes their driving test they can choose to display a ‘ p ’ ( @entity150 ) sign on their car to alert other motorists to the fact they are an inexperienced driver , but there is no compulsion			2
miss @entity9 wants serious consideration given to a mandatory ‘ p ’ scheme			0
she also believes that new drivers should take extra lessons in motorway driving			1
she notched up six penalty points ten years ago when she was twice caught by speed cameras exceeding the 30 mph limit			0
miss @entity9 is a keen cyclist , and frequently pulls over drivers who fail to give consideration to cyclists			0
but she also has a reputation for stopping cyclists who are not wearing helmets , have poor lights or are dressed inappropriately .			0
