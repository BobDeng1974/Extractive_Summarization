by @entity0 @entity1 has hailed @entity4 's @entity3 squad selection and believes that @entity5 can make an impact in @entity7 this summer			1
@entity5 boss @entity4 has selected a youthful party for the tournament with the likes of @entity12 duo @entity11 and @entity13 , @entity15 's @entity14 and @entity17 's @entity16 complimenting old heads like skipper @entity19 and @entity21 stalwart @entity20			2
@entity5 kick off in @entity22 against @entity23 on june 14 with little expectation on their shoulders but @entity1 , who won 115 caps , believes @entity4 has got his blend right and is hopeful that his countrymen can cause some upsets			1
belief : @entity1 is confident @entity5 can impress during the @entity31 in @entity7 ' i think it 's a really good selection			2
i think @entity4 has done really well since he 's come in as the manager of @entity5 , ' he told @entity35			2
' it 's a great job to have but it 's a tough job			2
' you 've got players that are playing at the top of their game and i think what he 's done is pick players that are at the top of their game			0
' they 're young players , they 've had great seasons			1
people have been saying it for years about players coming in to a big competition like this - it 's not about that anymore			0
' these young players have been playing in the biggest league in the world this season and quite a few seasons so there 's no players that are going to go on to this stage and be affected by it because you 've got players that are playing , week in and week out , against some of the best players in the world and in the biggest league in the world and for some of the biggest clubs in the world			1
' you 've got a captain like @entity19 ( @entity19 ) that has has had one of the best seasons probably for him and that @entity17 have had for quite a while			0
' you 've got players like that that are well respected by the young players and that the young players will want to play for			0
' so i think that we can cause a few upsets and a few surprises but obviously we have a tough group but there is no reason why we ca n't go really far in this competition			0
bright future : @entity1 believes @entity4 was right to take @entity13 ( left ) and @entity11 to @entity7 getting ready : @entity5 's @entity93 ( left ) , @entity16 and @entity92 have all been selected ' you 're coming up against a great team , the @entity95 , they always perform well in @entity98			1
they 've got great players and a great history but that can be a good thing for us			0
' we always perform well against the big teams and it does n't get much bigger than this			0
' @entity5 's opener against @entity23 is to be contested in @entity108 and @entity4 has openly expressed his concern over playing at the amazon venue where humidity can reach upwards of 80 per cent			1
but @entity1 travelled to three @entity98 with @entity5 as a player , as well as being part of @entity116 's staff in 2010 , and has few concerns about preparation ' @entity4 and his staff , they 're going to have all the lads prepared as much as possible , ' he said			1
' the preparation for @entity98 for @entity5 teams is always top class , they 're always looked after on every level and that wo n't be any different for this @entity3			0
bold : @entity5 boss @entity4 has selected several young players for his @entity3 squad ' the humidity and the heat is obviously going to be a factor but you can only prepare enough for those first games and they 'll do well			1
' the last time @entity5 faced @entity23 was in the quarter finals at @entity138 when they lost on penalties with spot kicks also proving to be their downfall at the @entity3 in 1990 , 1998 and 2006 and the @entity142 in 1996 and 2004			0
@entity1 is sure , however , that the injection of players not scarred by past failure can help @entity4 's men			1
three @entity5 : @entity1 travelled to three @entity98 with @entity5 as a player experience : @entity4 has still gone with @entity5 stalwarts @entity19 ( left ) and @entity20 ' we have n't had success in big competitions but sometimes it can be over-thought , ' he said			1
' @entity19 has scored some great penalties before ' you 've got some young players who are going to step up and not even be worried about it ' they 're going to go there and they do n't even have to worry penalties for quite a few games so just enjoy the occasion			2
' there 's no bigger competition in the world than the @entity3 and for a player to be going there it makes them proud			0

@entity1 claims @entity4 was right to select young players for @entity5 's @entity3 squad
former @entity5 captain hails @entity4 for doing a ' great job '
@entity1 believes young players that have had brilliant seasons *deserve* the *chance*
