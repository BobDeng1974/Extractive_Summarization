chat and messaging apps could be the downfall of @entity5 , experts claimed today			1
the huge rise of apps such as @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 among teens could cause major problems for @entity5 , they say			1
the key is teenagers - who say apps are ' blowing up ' among their friends , rather than @entity18 's established networking giant			1
teenagers are increasingly turning to chat apps to share pictures , researchers say - and it could spell trouble for @entity5 combining elements of text messaging and social networking , the apps allow photos , music and video to be easily shared			1
@entity32 , @entity33 - based @entity9 has racked up 40 million users since launching in 2010			0
@entity36 entrants in the race include @entity8 , funded by @entity38 , and @entity39 , launched earlier this month by a group of viral game makers			0
@entity39 has received seed - stage funding from @entity43 and @entity44 , among others , and claimed 1 million downloads in its first week			0
meanwhile , @entity48 companies are producing some of the fastest - growing apps in history			2
@entity51 's @entity10 boasts 400 million users - far more than @entity53 , by way of comparison - while line and @entity56 claim 120 million and 80 million users , respectively			2
the apps even offer similar features , allowing users to create personal profiles , build networks of friends and share photos , videos and music			2
that might sound precisely like @entity5 , but hundreds of millions of tech - savvy young people have instead turned to a wave of smartphone - based messaging apps that are now sweeping across @entity71 , @entity48 and @entity72			1
the hot apps include @entity9 and @entity8 , both products of @entity71 startups , as well as @entity56 's @entity56 , @entity76 's @entity55 and @entity51 's @entity10 , which have blossomed in @entity48 markets			1
combining elements of text messaging and social networking , the apps provide a quick - fire way for smartphone users to trade everything from brief texts to flirtatious pictures to @entity88 clips — bypassing both the sms plans offered by wireless carriers and established social networks originally designed as websites			1
@entity5 , with 1 billion users , remains by far the world 's most popular website , and its stepped - up focus on mobile has made it the most - used smartphone app as well			1
still , across @entity36 , investors and industry insiders say there is a possibility that the messaging apps could threaten @entity5 's dominance over the next few years			1
the larger ones are even starting to emerge as full - blown ' platforms ' that can support third - party applications such as games			0
to be sure , many of those who are using the new messaging apps remain on @entity5 , indicating there is little immediate sign of the giant social media company losing its lock on the market			1
and at a press event this week , the company will unveil news relating to @entity121 , the world 's most popular smartphone operating system , which could include a new version of @entity121 with deeper integration of @entity5 messaging tools - or possibly even a @entity5 - branded phone			1
but the firms that can take over the messaging world should be able to make some big inroads , investors say			2
' true interactions are conversational in nature , ' says @entity134 , a partner at @entity135 who invested in @entity136 - based @entity39 , a new entrant in the messaging market			1
the @entity8 app , which bypasses traditional social networks and allows teens to chat directly with each other , even sharing pictures , music and video ' more people text and make phone calls than get on to social networks			0
if one company dominates the replacement of that traffic , then by definition that 's very big			2
' @entity5 spokespeople declined to comment for this article , citing this thursday 's planned announcement			1
@entity5 's big challenge is reeling back users like @entity158 , a 15 - year old high school student in @entity159 in the @entity160 , who said the @entity9 messaging app ' blew up ' among his friends about six months ago			1
it has remained the most - used app on his @entity121 phone because it is the easiest way for him to send different kinds of multimedia for free , which he estimated he does about 200 times a day			1
@entity158 said he trades snapshots of his homework with friends while they stay up late studying for their exams — or not			0
' we also stay up in bed with our phone all night , just on @entity88 searching for funny videos , then you quickly share it with your friends , ' he added			0
you can flip in and out of @entity9			0
' @entity5 ' has really started to lose its edge over here , ' said @entity158 , who found his interactions on @entity5 less interesting than his real - time chats			2
@entity32 , @entity33 - based @entity9 has racked up 40 million users since launching in 2010			0
@entity36 entrants in the race include @entity8 , funded by @entity38 , and @entity39 , launched earlier this month by a group of viral game makers			0
@entity39 has received seed - stage funding from @entity43 and @entity44 , among others , and claimed 1 million downloads in its first week			0
meanwhile , @entity48 companies are producing some of the fastest - growing apps in history			2
@entity51 's @entity10 boasts 400 million users - far more than @entity53 , by way of comparison - while line and @entity56 claim 120 million and 80 million users , respectively			2
both have laid the groundwork to expand into the @entity204 market			0
the growth in the messaging apps reflect the dramatic shift in internet usage in recent years , as web visits via desktop computers have stagnated while smartphone ownership and app downloads have skyrocketed			1
chief executive @entity18 has publicly called @entity5 a ' mobile company ' to emphasize the company 's priorities			1
@entity32 , @entity33 - based @entity9 has racked up 40 million users since launching in 2010 last year , he splashed $ 1 billion for photo - sharing app @entity216 , which has remained red hot , while @entity5 also launched its own messenger app , offering a suite of smartphone communication tools			2
still , @entity5 has also been forced to play defense			2
earlier this year , the company cut off its data integration with a young startup called @entity225 and then mimicked its feature with a new messaging tool called @entity228 , which sends messages that self - destruct			2
it has also shut off its integration with messaging apps like @entity39 and @entity233			1
at the same time , @entity5 has also hired graphic artists to draw emoticons and graphics for messenger that emulate features of the wildly popular @entity48 apps like @entity55 , according to people with knowledge of the matter			1
path limits the number of people you can friend @entity247 , an early @entity5 employee who left to found the ' private ' social network path in 2010 , said he recognized last summer the critical role of messaging functions in smartphone apps , and quickly began working to incorporate them			1
since @entity243 released a new version of its app earlier this month , the number of @entity243 's daily users has risen 15 percent , which @entity257 attributed to the new messaging features			1
' what 's the number one reason why people have this thing ? ' said @entity257 , holding up his iphone			0
' it 's to call , to text , to communicate			0
' messaging , @entity257 added , is ' the basis for the mobile social network			0
' launched in november of 2010 , @entity243 has grown to include over five million people sharing life with close friends and family all over the world			0
the company is headquartered in downtown @entity136			0
however , unlike @entity5 and @entity53 , @entity243 is billed as an intensely private experience aimed at your real friends			2
there ’s a 150 - friend limit on the service , although most never reach that.the upside is that it seems to be used a lot more — there is none of the worry of your boss seeing your terrible holiday photos , and the gorgeous - looking app is also simple to use			0
' people have this deep desire to remember things , to remember their lives			0
' it ’s a source of real happiness for people , ' founder @entity247 told the @entity298			0
' it ’s the participation of your friends and family in the story that ’s exciting			0
' while established social networks move to incorporate messaging features , the new - wave messaging apps are looking to grow into social networking platforms that support a variety of features and enable innovations from outside developers			1
' the tried and true approach for a social network is first you build a network , then you build apps on your own , then you open it up to third party developers , ' said @entity318 , a partner at early stage venture capital firm @entity319			0
the moves mirror @entity5 's younger days , when its user growth and revenues were boosted by game publishers like @entity324 , which made popular games like @entity326 for the @entity5 platform			1
in the @entity332 market , for instance , eight of the top ten highest grossing @entity121 apps are games built on top of @entity56			1
@entity51 announced in november that it would introduce a mobile wallet feature enabling payment for goods with @entity10			0
and @entity51 also makes money in @entity340 by using the app 's location data to displaying nearby merchants ' deals to potential customers			0
if the messaging apps reach a certain scale , they could form networks that rival @entity5 's ' social graph , ' the network of user connections and activities that enable highly targeted delivery of content and advertising			1
' the folks on your address book are very different from your @entity5 friends and your @entity361 contacts , and that 's a natural place for a very powerful graph to be created , ' said @entity364 , a partner at @entity38			1
teens are increasingly turning to apps rather than traditional social networks @entity368 , the 25 - year old chief executive of @entity9 , said he developed the capability for his service to support external features in november , and he plans to open the platform to outside developers in the near future			1
@entity368 said @entity9 and @entity8 were ' in a race to see who 's the first to build a platform			0
' @entity8 , which has been the most widely downloaded communication app for both @entity379 and @entity121 in recent months , according to analysis firm @entity380 , has been profitable by selling subscriptions to its service for $ 1 a year			2
although it has remained mum about its platform plans , the company has been rumored to be in talks with @entity48 game publishers about hosting games , according to news reports in @entity332			0
@entity364 declined to address the reports , saying only that because it relied on a subscription business model , @entity8 did not need to sell games or ads to make money			0
still , he said , the @entity397 ' spends a lot of time thinking about the developer community			0

experts say teenagers are increasingly turning to messaging apps instead of @entity5
comes as @entity5 expected to unveil its own version of @entity135 's @entity121 *software* and *handset* on thursday with *improved* messaging capabilities
