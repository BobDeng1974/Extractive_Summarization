three - month - old @entity1 pygmiy @entity0 , posing in a cup at owner @entity4 's home in @entity5 , @entity6 with her brown and white spikes , beady black eyes and small nose , @entity8 the hedgehog is certainly an unusual - looking pet			1
but her owner , 35 - year - old @entity13 , is besotted			1
‘ she has a wonderful personality , ’ enthuses the project manager from @entity15			1
‘ she recognises me and smiles when she ’s happy			1
she ’s a lovely creature			1
’ @entity13 , who bought @entity8 for £ 150 from a breeder in @entity19 two years ago , is n’t the only one to fall for the charms of a ‘ hedgie ’			1
it ’s thought there are now more than 10,000 being kept as pets in the @entity25			1
fans delight in posting photographs of their pets dressed in comical outfits online			1
some have even become celebrities			2
@entity32 , a three - year - old hedgehog from @entity34 in the @entity35 , has more than 400,000 followers on @entity37			2
another , @entity38 , has become an internet sensation after his owner posted photographs of the hedgehog skateboarding and taking a bath			2
he can be recognised by his single white tooth , which protrudes comically from his mouth			2
so how did the hedgehog become such a popular pet ? there ’s no doubt they are sweet looking			1
they rarely grow longer than 11 ins and weigh around 1 lb. the type most people buy as pets — the @entity57 — is a cross between the @entity60 - bellied hedgehog , native to central and eastern @entity1 , and the @entity62 hedgehog			1
some are pale , like the snowy @entity65 hedgehog ; others , like the @entity67 , are cappuccino - coloured			2
the @entity68 is dark brown			2
despite having up to 6,000 quills each — which protrude when they curl into a ball — they are surprisingly docile and easy to handle			2
‘ if they like you , the spines lie flat and they can be picked up and patted , ’ says @entity13			2
‘ they enjoy being cuddled — @entity8 often falls asleep on my lap in the evenings			2
when they ’re happy , they make little squeaks , which sound like purring			2
’ unlike some cats and dogs , they do not trigger allergies , nor do they give off the strong odour of hamsters or rats			2
this is n’t the first time pet hedgehogs have been popular			1
children ’s author @entity100 had one named mrs @entity101 which inspired her famous story of the same name in 1905			2
@entity106 families often kept hedgehogs in kitchens as a form of pest control , as they eat insects			1
today , @entity112 — the type found in the wild in the @entity25 — are protected and it is illegal to have them as pets			1
@entity118 , however , have been kept as pets since they were first brought into the @entity25 just over a decade ago , after becoming fashionable in the @entity35 in the late @entity120			1
it is only recently that they have become hugely popular			1
last week , it was reported that the @entity124 had seen a 5 per cent rise in membership in the past six months			1
@entity38 , pictured , has become an internet sensation after his owner posted photographs of the hedgehog skateboarding and taking a bath however , keeping a hedgehog is not something to be taken lightly			2
while they may suit those working long hours who can not meet the demands of a dog that needs walking , they are far from low maintenance			2
they must be kept in a warm environment — above 21 degrees celsius			2
metal cages are n’t recommended , as hedgehogs are accomplished climbers and tend to clamber up the metal bars			1
give them the run of a room , however , and they may get into difficulties			0
in 2011 , firemen in the @entity155 were called to rescue a hedgehog that had become stuck after climbing onto a high bathroom shelf			0
the @entity158 , which promotes responsible ownership of hedgehogs in the @entity25 , recommends keeping them in a large vivarium or glass tank			1
hedgies are also vulnerable to health problems			0
they can suffer from @entity166 , which may sound amusing , but actually has a devastating effect			0
this incurable neurological disease causes the animal to become gradually paralysed			1
it is thought that damage to the immune system through over-breeding could be to blame , since the disease has not affected wild @entity175 can be fatal			0
before she adopted @entity8 , @entity13 owned another hedgie , named @entity177 , who developed @entity166 and died aged two			0
@entity4 , 24 , with her pet pygmies @entity180 , left , who is is three months old and @entity181 , right , who is six months old their normal lifespan is between three and eight years			0
‘ it was terrible , ’ says @entity13			0
‘ she was like a family member and there was nothing we could do			0
’ hedgies have sensitive stomachs and are prone to obesity , which can cause complications , such as fatty liver disease and heart attacks			0
@entity196 , a 36 - year - old volunteer at @entity197 in @entity198 , adopted her pet hedgehog @entity199 from the @entity201 in november 2012			0
he had been abandoned by a family who claimed their children ‘ did n’t want him any more ’ and weighed nearly 2lb — far too much for his 6 in - long frame			0
‘ i had to put him on a low - fat diet and he was clearly unhappy — he ’d roll into a ball and hiss and push his spikes out			0
it took quite a bit of cuddling and attention before he came round and relaxed , ’ she says			0
owners are advised to feed their hedgehogs a mix of low - fat cat foods — mixing varieties ensures that should one brand be discontinued , the hedgehog ’s stomach wo n’t be too upset by a sudden change			1
for a treat , they enjoy live insects as well as certain cooked foods , such as chicken and boiled eggs			0
@entity13 says @entity8 is fond of mint , while @entity177 would lap up anything sprinkled with coriander			0
one way to stop hedgehogs putting on too much weight is to set up a hamster wheel			1
they are energetic when given the chance , and can run the equivalent of more than three miles a night			0
the type most people buy as pets , the @entity240 , is a cross between the @entity60 - bellied hedgehog , native to central and eastern @entity1 , and the @entity62 hedgehog the @entity158 , which promotes responsible ownership of hedgehogs in the @entity25 , recommends keeping them in a large vivarium or glass tank there is , of course , a danger that if hedgies become too popular , then unscrupulous breeders will attempt to cash in on the trend			1
dedicated societies such as the @entity124 and the @entity158 keep lists of approved breeders , but on websites such as @entity263 , hedgehogs are advertised for sale anonymously for up to £ 200			1
but many ‘ backyard ’ breeders do n’t understand — or do n’t care — that hedgehogs have delicate reproductive systems			1
mate a hedgehog younger than six months and it may be unable to care for its young			0
but if a mother hedgehog is more than a year old when she has her first litter , her pelvis may have fused , requiring a @entity276			0
@entity4 , a 24 - year - old breeder from @entity6 , and head of the @entity158 , says : ‘ there should be a licensing system in place			0
’ hedgehog conservationists warn fraudsters may attempt to catch wild @entity283 @entity112 to pass off as pets			1
@entity285 , hedgehog conservationist and author of a prickly affair : the @entity288 , fears such fraud is inevitable			0
last week , it was reported that the @entity124 had seen a five per cent rise in membership in the past six months he says this would be disastrous for our indigenous hedgehog population , which is already struggling — population figures have plummeted by 37 per cent in the past decade — and leave unsuspecting customers with animals they ca n’t handle			1
‘ wild hedgehogs are very different creatures and are totally inappropriate as pets , ’ he says			1
following the similar recent trend for ‘ micropigs ’ , several owners found that rather than buying specially bred miniature pigs , they had been sold baby farm animals			0
earlier this year , 46 - year - old @entity308 was threatened with eviction from her rented home in @entity311 after she bought what she believed to be a micropig — only for it to grow into a 21st hog			0
animal charities are warning that the sudden popularity of the pygmy hedgehog could lead to people buying them on impulse , then abandoning them			1
since the start of 2013 , the @entity201 has taken in 89 discarded pygmies			0
‘ we ’re seeing an increase of hogs coming in for various reasons , such as job losses and change of circumstances , ’ says @entity324 , who works for the @entity201			0
for devoted hedgie fans such as @entity4 , @entity13 and @entity196 , that prospect is heart - breaking			0
@entity196 says : ‘ people just think , “ oh , are n’t they cute ” , and get them on a whim but , in fact , they need a lot of care			1
’ nevertheless , she says that , for those prepared to look after their hedgies properly , @entity1 @entity118 are a joy : ‘ they are amazing creatures			0
@entity199 is quirky , funny and unique			0
he makes me smile every day			0
he ’s gone from being a ball of spikes to part of the family			0

@entity356 came to @entity25 a decade ago but have only recently became popular
