the remains of a baby woolly rhinoceros , which still has its fleece , has been discovered in the ice of @entity4			1
named @entity5 , the extinct creature - which must be at least 10,000 years old and is the first juvenile woolly rhino to be found - was well preserved by permafrost and experts are hopeful of extracting its dna			1
a local hunter found the infant woolly rhino in a ravine by a stream in @entity17 's largest and coldest region , the @entity18 , also known as @entity18 , in september			1
it is the first juvenile of the species to be found initially , he thought the carcass was a reindeer , until he saw the horn growths and realised he had made the historic discovery of the world 's first baby woolly rhino			1
‘ the age of the calf when it died has yet to be established , but scientists estimate it to be about 18 months old , ’ @entity34 reported			0
‘ @entity39 tests will be conducted to ascertain when @entity5 died , with the results likely in six months			2
‘ the creature 's wool is well preserved , and an ear , one eye , its nostrils , and mouth are clearly visible			1

the animal 's lower half is missing as it was sticking out of the permafrost and was eaten by wild animals a local hunter found the infant woolly rhino in a ravine by a stream in @entity17 's largest and coldest region , the @entity18 , also known as @entity18 , in september			1
the region and its capital city is shown ancient beast : based on skeletons and cave paintings , scientists believe that adult woolly rhinos ( illustrated ) were up to 13ft ( 4 metres ) long the woolly rhinoceros is an extinct species of rhinoceros that was common throughout @entity69 and northern @entity70 during the @entity72 epoch and survived the last glacial period			2
the last of the species is thought to have died out around 10,000 years ago			0
in the @entity72 , the woolly rhino roamed across @entity69 and @entity70 from @entity76 and @entity77 in the west , to @entity79 in the east			1
it was well adapted to its environment , with stocky limbs and a thick woolly fleece to suit the icy tundra			0
previous studies using @entity87 from the ancient creatures have found that its closest modern relative is the @entity92 rhino			2
based on skeletons and cave paintings , scientists believe that adult woolly rhinos were up to 13ft ( 4metres ) long and weighed as much as 4,400lbs ( 2,000kg )			2
the two horns on the skull were made of keratin - the longest being 24 inches ( 61cm ) - and the woolly rhinoceros used them for defensive purposes and to attract mates , but spent most of its time grazing on grasses			0
the reason for their extinction around 10,000 years ago is not fully understood , but like woolly mammoths , they may have been over-hunted by early man and affected by the receding @entity111 and the spread of disease			1
‘ the remnants of two horns were found on the carcass			0
’ @entity117 , head of the @entity118 , of the @entity119 , said : ‘ the find is absolutely unique			0
‘ we can count a number of adult woolly rhinos found around the world on fingers of one hand			2
a baby rhino was never found before			2
‘ there was only one case in the 21st century when we found a frozen carcass of a grown up woolly rhino in @entity18			1
it was in 2007 in @entity132			0
‘ in the 20th century there were carcasses of woolly mammoths found in @entity136 and @entity138 districts , but they were mummified and therefore not usable for studies			1

here , the baby rhino 's foot and leg is shown			1
scientists hope to extract @entity87 from the remains previous studies using @entity87 from the ancient creatures have found that its closest modern relative is the @entity92 rhino ( pictured ) he added : ‘ even to find a skull of a baby rhino is very lucky indeed			1
‘ the possible explanation to it is that rhinos bred very slowly			0
mothers protected baby rhinos really well , so that cases of successful attacks on them were extremely rare and the mortality rate was very low			1
’ @entity194 rhinos are less studied than mammoths			0
dr @entity117 said : ‘ we are hoping @entity5 the rhino will give us a lot of answers to questions of how they grew and developed , what conditions they lived in , and which of the modern day animals is the closest to them			1
‘ we know nothing about baby rhinos , while the morphology of adults is better known			0
’ ‘ so far we did n't have a chance to work even with a tooth of a baby rhino , and now we have the whole skull , the head , soft tissues , and well preserved teeth			2
’ scientists will first try to extract @entity87 from the remains , which was kept frozen to increase the chances of this being possible			0
they hope to get results in a ‘ week or two ’			0

mr @entity224 and his friend @entity236 were sailing past a ravine and noticed hair ‘ hanging on top of it ’			0
he explained : ‘ at first we thought it was a reindeer 's carcass , but after it thawed and fell down we saw a horn on its upper jaw and realised it must be a rhino			0
‘ the part of the carcass that stuck out of the ice was eaten by wild animals , but the rest of it was inside the permafrost and preserved well			2

baby woolly mammoth , named @entity5 , was found in @entity4 ice by hunters in the @entity18
first juvenile to be found , possibly because infant mortality rate was low and the animals bred slowly
@entity5 's wool , an ear , one eye , its nostrils , and mouth are well preserved and scientists will first try to extract dna
the reason for the woolly rhino 's extinction is not fully understood , but like woolly mammoths , they may have been over-hunted by early man and affected by the receding @entity111 and the spread of disease
