@entity1 agents rarely speak , but there ’s nothing wrong with their hearing			1
agents confessed to @entity6 , author of an upcoming blockbuster book about the hidden lives of presidents , that they have overheard @entity10 pushing her husband ‘ to be more aggressive in attacking @entity12 and to side with blacks in racial controversies			1
’ and @entity10 did as he was told , says @entity6 in @entity16			1
' that could have been me thirty - five years ago ' , @entity10 stated			1
@entity10 was also vocal about a @entity33 , @entity32 police officer who arrested a black @entity35 profession being noisy during a break - in investigation			1
he viewed it as an unnecessary and stupid arrest			0
a former agent listening to the first couple 's conversations in the presidential limo , believed @entity10 's agenda goes back to a statement she made when @entity20 was running for president			1
' for the first time in my adult lifetime , i am really proud of my country '			0
significant : new book , @entity16 , claims that @entity10 tried to push president @entity10 into being more vocal in support of the family of @entity25 following his death at the hands of @entity26 , ( right ) beer summit : vice president , @entity56 , ( left ) , @entity35 professor , @entity56 , sgt. @entity56 and president @entity10 at the so - called @entity57 at the @entity24 2009 is rude as @entity58 is to the @entity1 , the current first lady , code named @entity61 , is friendly , considerate and treats the agents with respect			1
she has twenty agents protecting her and she insists that they all call her by her first name			0
‘ @entity10 is friendly – she touches you ’ , an agent stated and her mother , @entity67 , in residence at the @entity24 to help care for their two daughters , goes out of her way to be gracious to the @entity1 as well			1
@entity10 even gave @entity74 cards to agents who were dads and working the shift on that day			1
the @entity77 invited agents to dinner two times at their @entity81 home in @entity82 while he was running for president , and he made sure the agents took time out to eat the chili			2
while @entity87 was chronically late , @entity10 usually runs on time but if he ’s dragging , @entity10 gets on his case and reminds him he is being disrespectful to the agents			1
gatecrashers : @entity92 and @entity93 attended a @entity24 function without invitation in 2009 and were introduced to president @entity10 in one of the @entity1 's most notorious security breaches @entity22 and @entity21 get high marks for being ‘ great kids ’ and ‘ very respectable young ladies ’			1
while both @entity20 and @entity10 are well liked and respected by the @entity1 , agents disclosed that laxness and undercutting of basic security protocols in this administration now threaten the life of the president as well as the @entity59			1
lax security has allowed guests into events without proper screening to detect firearms			2
current agency protocols are not up - to - date and using the latest firearms and they have cut back on the size of counterassault teams			2
agents are also filling out their own test scores on their physical fitness tests as well as not following proper rules for firearm re-qualification			0
this imposed cost cutting and lowering of standards first emerged when serial party crashers @entity93 and @entity124 and @entity125 were allowed into a @entity24 state dinner in november 2009 while not on the guest list			0
special treatment : according to @entity16 , @entity130 superstar @entity129 was allowed to drive his car into a function attended by the president and exempted by security checks the ‘ gatecrashers ’ were subpoenaed by the @entity135 @entity137 @entity136 to appear at a hearing to discuss the breach of security where they invoked the @entity142			2
allegations : @entity6 has claimed that the @entity1 has a huge underfunding problem in his new book @entity16 the lowered agency security standards surfaced again when agents were sent home in april 2012 and exposed as engaging prostitutes while traveling with @entity10 to @entity151 , @entity152			1
their sordid little affairs blew up when one belligerent agent refused to pay the prostitute her requisite fee			0
if agents blow the whistle on any breach of security , they know they will suffer retribution from management so they keep quiet			2
‘ the pressure not to rock the boat takes precedence over protecting the president from the jackal , the term agents use to refer to a potential assassin ’			2
another major breach of security occurred on the night of the @entity173 ’s dinner at the @entity174 in april 2013			0
while the advance security detail swept the hotel and grounds , agents received orders from a high - ranking agency official in @entity181 to allow movie star @entity129 ’s vehicle onto the grounds without screening			0
agents were shocked at the breach knowing that it could have been loaded with explosives , biological or chemical weapons			0
the canine team was not even allowed to inspect the vehicle			0
‘ agents were told not to sweep the car			0
just let it in and do n’t give @entity129 any problems ’			0
@entity129 was given a free pass – ‘ and this was two weeks after the terrorist attack on our soil in @entity199 ’			0
‘ that ’s just one example of the arrogance of senior managers in the @entity1			2
they think they ’re accountable to no one ’			0

new book claims that @entity10 asked president @entity10 to be vocal in support of @entity210
first lady *wanted* her husband to back family of @entity25
' @entity216 ' *delves* into the secret world of president 's *personal* guard
the @entity1 are underfunded and security lapses are more common
