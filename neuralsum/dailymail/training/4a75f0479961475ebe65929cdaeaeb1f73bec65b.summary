the @entity1 archdiocese of @entity2 and @entity3 in @entity4 has filed for bankruptcy protection in wake of huge sex abuse claims			1
up to 300 estimated claimants have lodged complaints against church employees in the area with the majority of cases dating from the 1950s to the 1980s			1
the total amount owed to victims tops $ 100 million according to the @entity16 , however the church has declared assets totaling ten to fifty million dollars			1
the lawsuits will be put on hold while the bankruptcy issues are resolved , giving religious leaders time to react accordingly			2
' by filing for [ bankruptcy ] , we are not avoiding our responsibilities , but recognizing them			1
' @entity2 attorney @entity45 suggested on friday that the bankruptcy process could take about two years			1
the @entity1 archdiocese of @entity2 and @entity3 connects 188 parishes , 91 schools and 825,000 members and a handful of charities			2
it is the 12th @entity54 diocese - out of around 200 nationwide - to seek such action in the face of sex abuse claims			0
an attorney for the @entity2 and @entity3 victims , @entity58 , said the bankruptcy filing wo n't stop scrutiny of the archdiocese			1
but church officials have ' promised to treat victims fairly during this process , ' said @entity58 , whose firm is working with the archdiocese as part of an october settlement on child protection issues			1
but @entity71 , another victims ' attorney , said he 's disappointed			2
@entity71 is handling a lawsuit scheduled for trial this month , and he said the bankruptcy filing robs him of the chance to reveal information that could help protect children in the future			1
' the process of bankruptcy is not going to make kids safer , ' he said			0
' i do n't think it 's any accident that they filed a week before this trial was going to start			0
' in a letter to parishioners , archbishop @entity27 said he ordered the bankruptcy as the fairest way to distribute the archdiocese 's finite resources to victims			1
' this is not an attempt to silence victims or deny them justice in court , ' @entity27 wrote			0
@entity4 lawmakers created a three - year window in 2013 for victims of past sexual abuse to file claims that otherwise would have been barred by the statute of limitations			0
since then , the archdiocese has been sued roughly two dozen times , and it has received more than 100 notices of potential claims , according to @entity112 , the archdiocese 's chancellor for civil affairs			2
the mission of the church and its day - to - day operations will continue through bankruptcy , archdiocese attorney @entity115 said			2
parishes and schools , which are incorporated separately from the archdiocese 's central office , should not be affected			0
' it 's a smart move on their part , ' @entity124 , an associate professor at @entity125 , said of the bankruptcy filing			1
' it ultimately can be useful for the victims taken as a whole , assuming that the diocese treats them fairly			0
' not all bankruptcy filings have gone smoothly			0
the @entity136 of @entity138 's bankruptcy has dragged on for four years as attorneys fight over who should get paid and how much			2
but in @entity143 , the @entity141 of @entity142 sought protection only after working out a deal with victims			0
the deal was approved by a judge earlier this week			0
the @entity2 and @entity3 archdiocese does not have a pre-packaged plan for reorganization , but the archdiocese will try to avoid prolonged fights seen in other dioceses , @entity115 said			0
the archdiocese has already addressed issues that have bogged down other bankruptcies , including implementing a new system to protect children and disclosing thousands of pages of church documents and the names of accused priests			0
as a result , @entity115 said , this bankruptcy could focus purely on financial restitution to victims			0
@entity58 , the victims ' attorney , said the process also will allow victims to look at the church 's finances , and allow the archdiocese and victims to pursue insurance companies			1
@entity176 said he hopes parishioners see the bankruptcy filing as a necessary step to close ' a horrendous and tragic chapter in the life of the church			1

up to 300 estimated claimants have lodged complaints against church employees in the @entity188 archdiocese

according to a bankruptcy filing made by the @entity188 diocese the total amount owed to victims tops $ 100 million
