by @entity0 it 's the kind of disastrous throw we all remember cringingly from school - but then , we 're not all $ 500,000 - a - year @entity6 stars			1
a @entity8 newcomer has been mocked after his gentle underarm toss to first base went wildly wrong and sailed over his teammate 's head			1
@entity13 was in @entity15 's @entity14 last night when he had an easy chance to get out @entity18 batter @entity17			1
pictured is @entity13 ( left ) preparing to throw the ball disastrous : as @entity13 ( left ) approaches infielder @entity25 , the ball flies out of his hand too fast ball in hand , the 25 - year - old pitcher jogged towards first base before releasing the ball over a distance of little more than a dozen feet			1
but instead of reaching the waiting arms of infielder @entity25 , it soared away over his head to the surprise of everyone on the field			0
live coverage showed @entity17 slowing down at first base before turning around confused , seeing the ball and promptly racing away to second base			0
luckily for @entity13 his error - which pundits said was one of three he made on the night - did not result in a run for the @entity18			2
but the @entity47 team still won 4 - 2 leading to widespread mockery of @entity13 , who had been making his first career start at the @entity14			1
oops ! within seconds it was clear to tv viewers - and @entity13 's teammate - that things had gone wildly wrong keep going ! @entity18 batter @entity17 ( second left ) saw the mistake and promptly raced to second base baseball fans pointed out it was the first time a @entity8 pitcher had made three errors in one game since 1988 , when @entity62 made three in just one play			1
others compared @entity13 's performance to that of a 5ft 105 - year - old widow who made a decisive first pitch the previous night - while leaning on a walking frame			2
@entity70 , the oldest resident at her retirement home in @entity72 , @entity73 , stunned onlookers at a @entity76 game by winding her arm several times before making a strong underhand toss			0
@entity80 users reacted instantly to @entity13 's foul - up last night , with many questioning whether it was the worst underarm throw ever			2
fan @ goth_dog wrote : ' @entity13 : the extra " e " stands for @entity85 ' , while @entity87 ' verdict was damning : ' this is about as badly as you can mess up a light underhanded toss '			0
rookie pitcher @entity13 joined the @entity8 ' 40 - man roster in november , and made his first start earlier this month after signing a contract worth a reputed $ 500,000 a year			0
' not winning a @entity94 anytime soon ' : how some users reacted to @entity13 's errors on @entity80 hot competition : some compared @entity13 's throw unfavourably to that of @entity70 , a 105 - year - old @entity76 fan who made an impressive ceremonial first pitch on sunday while leaning on a walking frame			0

@entity13 was making first career start at @entity14 in @entity15
