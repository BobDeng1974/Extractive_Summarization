by @entity0 desperate villagers who have been cut off from the rest of the country by floods for more than three weeks have received help from a floating bridge			1
the pontoon has been set up along a country road linking the village of @entity11 to the rest of @entity13			1
the bridge allows villagers to walk part of the journey to dry land , which must still be completed by boat			2
@entity11 has been inaccessible by land since 2 january , and some parts of the surrounding countryside are 5 feet underwater			0
@entity11 , which lies between @entity47 and @entity48 , was also devastated last year by the worst floods for decades			2
a vital boat service operated by @entity51 , which is ferrying people to work and school , as well as shipping in supplies , is continuing as the access roads are still flooded			2
images of the flooded road shows cars completely submerged , while villagers can be seen canoeing between their homes and the ' mainland '			1
the floods which have hit @entity11 have been described as the worst in a century , though the village - the name of which means ' @entity66 ' in @entity67 - is often cut off by high waters			1
the @entity69 does not have any severe flood warnings - meaning a risk to life - in force in @entity36 but there are several flood warnings in place			1
help : boat services such as these are the only means of bringing supplies to the village flooded : the country road , now a waterway , would usually be surrounding by tall vegetation supplies : parts of the roads are shallow enough to be traversed on foot , left , or by tractor , right , but the villagers of @entity11 are currently reliant on boat services damage : @entity11 villager @entity91 has seen his home ravaged by high waters over the past weeks dozens of pumps have been deployed in an attempt to ease the flooding , but an @entity69 spokesman said it could be weeks before the water is fully removed			1
the @entity101 has issued an amber warning of rain for @entity36 with 10mm to 20mm forecast			1
' with water levels already exceptionally high on the @entity107 , the public should be prepared for further flooding , ' a @entity101 spokesman said			0
@entity109 , chief executive of @entity110 , said : ' several @entity112 communities have been severely affected by the floodwaters for some weeks now			0
' with significant rainfall expected over the coming days we feel this situation needs to be escalated as a major incident			0
' @entity110 would like to extend its continued sympathy for the residents , business owners and farmers affected by flooding			0
' sunk : the waters surrounding the village are deep enough to cover cars no respite : the village often floods , and the @entity69 says it could be weeks before the water subsides coping : villager @entity129 assesses the damage to her home			2
the village has been inaccessible by land since 2 january help : @entity51 has extended a boat service to move people at supplies to and from @entity11 the council said it would continue to provide practical support to residents whose properties are flooded or are predicted to flood			1
this ranges from the supply of portable toilets where septic tanks are overwhelmed to sandbag collection points in villages and deliveries to the most vulnerable properties			0
the council said it had provided around 3,000 sandbags in the past few weeks and is also offering housing advice and is on standby to provide temporary accommodation			0
@entity51 is campaigning for the dredging of rivers on the @entity156 and has recently pledged a further Â £ 500,000 towards the cost - a move backed by @entity110 .			0

@entity11 in @entity36 has been cut off from the rest of the country by flood waters for more than three weeks
a floating bridge has now been built along the flooded road , which shortens the necessary journeys by water
villagers have been reliant on volunteer and council - run boat services to deliver fuel and food supplies for weeks
the floods could be set to worsen over the weekend as the @entity101 forecasts another 10 - 20mm of rain
