by @entity0 published : 17:14 est , 28 july 2013 updated : 07:50 est , 29 july 2013 with her painstakingly - applied make up and fashionable clothes , @entity1 is like any other teenager			1
but behind her stylish looks , the teenager is battling a devastating genetic condition that is slowly paralysing her			1
the 17 - year - old , from @entity8 , is suffering from fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva ( @entity9 ) , a disorder that is turning her muscle and tendon into bone			1
@entity1 , 17 , has a debilitating genetic condition that causes her to grow a ' second skeleton ' her arms are locked onto a bent position and she struggles to raise them above her waist			1
@entity1 with her 22 year old sister @entity22 ( right ) , who is helping to raise money to fight the condition already , her arms have become locked into a bent position at her waist , rendering them immobile like a statue			1
the teenager has grown extra bone over her shoulders so she can no longer reach above her waist and struggles to brush or wash her own hair or dress without assistance - and the condition could get even worse			1
the slightest knock or bump causes painful flare - ups that trigger the irreversible bone growth which locks her joints into place , and she can not have any injections or biopsies as this too may cause unwanted bone to form			1
@entity1 with her mother @entity46 ( left ) , 58 , and sister @entity22			2
miss @entity46 says she lives in constant fear her daughter will be in an accident that will exacerbate her condition bone growth caused by @entity53 is different to regular bones happier times : @entity1 as a baby			1
she was not diagnosed with the condition until she was 12			0
@entity59 , @entity1 and @entity22 as youngsters perversely , the condition makes it harder for her to avoid accidents as she finds it hard to steady herself on banisters when climbing the stairs and her locked arms affect her balance			1
she ca n't even out out her hands to break her fall , a situation she describes as ' scary '			0
but the debilitating condition has not hampered her hobbies or social life			0
a keen cook , she loves to shop and spend time with her friends			0
@entity78 love : @entity22 is climbing @entity79 in @entity80 to raise cash to combat @entity1 's condition ' my friends are brilliant , they do my hair for me sometimes and help me get my coat on and anything i ca n't do really , ' she said			1
@entity1 uses barbecue tongs to apply make up and a comb with an extended handle to do her hair			2
the teenager , who passed 10 gcses , including five a grades , told the @entity95 : ' i just crack on with things to be honest			0
there is no other option			0
' it 's taken me the last five years to get to the point where i 'm able to push it to the back of my mind and just carry on			0
' the condition is particularly frustrating for @entity1 because before she was diagnosed she was a keen sports fan , playing tag rugby and frequently visiting the gym			1
@entity108 , @entity1 's mother said : ' her friends are all great			2
they all look out for each other and just get on with being girls and enjoying themselves			0
' @entity1 was diagnosed with @entity9 in 2008 after she was admitted to hospital following a minor trampoline accident			1
' she had fallen on her back and it had caused a sore lump to form , ' said miss @entity46			0
' it was huge , hard red and hot to the touch , so i took her to the hospital to get it checked out			0
' unfamiliar with the symptoms , doctors at @entity125 told her not to worry , and sent her home - but when the lump did n't clear and @entity1 began complaining of severe pain , her mother rushed her to the @entity131 and @entity132			2
mri scans and further testing revealed the diagnosis			0
' it was a horrible shock , ' said mrs @entity46 , speaking in 2009			0
she added that she is always on the lookout when she 's out with @entity1 , living in fear that a skateboarder or someone on a scooter will crash into her			2
there is no cure for @entity9 and only about 600 people in the world have been diagnosed with it			1
@entity1 is forced to rely on over-the - counter pain killers to combat the condition			1
like many other girls her age , @entity1 is into make up and fashion			0
she has adopted more sedate pursuits because of her @entity9 , but used to be a keen sportswoman even a simple injection at the dentist is off - limits , so the teenager has to take good care of her teeth			2
the family is trying to raise Â£ 120,000 for the @entity9 research team , which gets no funding from the government , and her sister @entity22 is setting off on a charity trek up @entity79 in @entity80 to raise cash later this week			2
@entity1 is furious that the battle to cure the condition gets so little support			2
she said : ' if you get me started on that i will really have a right old rant , especially when i hear about girls getting boob jobs on the @entity177 or politicians and their spending sprees			0
' to support her sister 's fundraising trek visit her virgin money giving page to donate online .			0

@entity1 has *fop* - an *incredibly* rare genetic condition
her muscle and tendons are slowly turning to bone
the slightest knock can cause painful flare - ups and lock up her body
just 600 people in the world have @entity9 , which receives little funding
