police were yesterday accused of a catastrophic series of blunders over their handling of a dossier containing more than 2,000 suspected paedophiles			1
@entity7 details have emerged of how some forces and a top anti-child abuse unit failed to act after being given a ‘ customer list ’ of perverts who used a child porn website			1
despite being handed the information on a plate by @entity19 police who traced the @entity23 - based website ’s international network of clients , @entity15 suspects were left free to continue offending for up to two years and hundreds may now escape justice			1
@entity7 details have emerged of how some forces and a top anti-child abuse unit failed to act after being given a ‘ customer list ’ of perverts who used a child porn website			1
file image used investigators in @entity23 yesterday admitted their surprise at the inaction of @entity15 police – who in some cases refused to even answer calls or return messages			1
the true scale of how officers failed to act on the results of the huge @entity19 undercover operation can now be laid bare for the first time , including how : at the centre of scandal is @entity48 , a multi-million - pound website based in @entity23 that sold child porn films to customers worldwide			1
following a raid in 2011 , investigators uncovered a huge client database and found that @entity15 visitors were among the most frequent			1
the customer list was quietly shared with police forces around the world who rounded up and jailed suspects			2
a file containing the names of up to 2,345 suspects had been sent to the @entity64 ( @entity64 ) in 2012 , but was shelved after a superficial review found some of the material was ‘ low grade ’			2
it was not until november the following year when the huge success of the operation was made public in @entity19 that @entity15 police realised they had made a mistake			1
@entity64 ’s successor , the @entity74 ( @entity74 ) , ordered the details to be rushed out to forces across @entity77 and @entity78			1
but even then , some forces inexplicably failed to take action for many more months , leading to a total delay of about two years			2
it later became clear that many suspects were working in positions of responsibility and were actively abusing children			0
among them was teacher @entity88 and cancer specialist dr @entity89 , who manipulated the treatment of young patients to give him more chances to abuse them			0
the latest suspect to emerge is father @entity94 , 60 , a clergyman in @entity95 , @entity96 , who was not arrested until may last year when officers found indecent films on the computer at his @entity101 vicarage			1
he fell from cliffs in a suspected suicide near @entity104 shortly before he was due to answer bail in november			0
one of the names on the list of men suspected of buying child porn films from a @entity23 - based website was @entity77 vicar @entity94 ( pictured ) one of the names on the list of men suspected of buying child porn films from a @entity23 - based website was a @entity77 vicar			1
but after being tipped off by colleagues in @entity19 , it was almost two years before police and other officials raided the home of father @entity94 , 60			1
when officers finally searched his @entity101 vicarage in @entity95 , @entity96 , they found 31 indecent films on his computer			1
but days before he was due to answer police bail he appears to have killed himself by jumping off a cliff in @entity126 near @entity104			0
allegations about the vicar were passed to a @entity15 child abuse unit in 2012 following an operation by @entity19 investigators			1
but his name , along more than 2,000 others , was left in an in - tray until 2013 , when it was belatedly passed on to the metropolitan police			2
it was not until may last year that they raided his home by @entity141 ’s church			0
asked whether police should have acted faster to arrest @entity94 , in light of the access he had to hundreds of children , a @entity143 spokesman said : ‘ the films and images were examined and we are content that they had not been produced by the suspect			1
‘ we will make arrests where we have gathered sufficient evidence to do so			0
’ parishioners this week said they had been kept in the dark about @entity94 ’s arrest – and many attended a packed ‘ service of thanksgiving ’ on sunday unaware that he was facing child porn charges			1
it was only over the last fortnight that churchgoers and parents at the @entity77 primary school next door to the church were told ‘ safeguarding ’ issues had been raised about the vicar			2
churchgoers were also told that @entity94 had ‘ taken a step back ’ for ‘ personal reasons ’			0
the vicar , who had been promoted to canon , was a regular visitor to the popular @entity77 primary school next door to the church , and was also involved with his own choir and sunday school			2
however , churchgoers and parents have been told that his offending did not relate his activities at the school			0
a spokesman for the @entity77 ’s @entity189 diocese , said : ‘ the church and school were told he had stood back from ministry for personal reasons			0
they have now been told the reason for this			0
‘ the @entity196 has been assured that the reasons for @entity94 ’s arrest are not related to the church or the school			0
‘ we are all flawed human beings and it is helpful , no matter what the circumstances of a person ’s life or death , for those who knew them to be able to pray for them			0
’ an inquest is to be held in april			0
yesterday @entity23 police told of their frustration at the lack of communication with the @entity15			1
detective sgt @entity215 said : ‘ we were trying to connect but we were n’t getting any feedback			0
’ she said @entity217 and the @entity218 were ‘ fast to act ’ and officers spoke directly to colleagues in @entity221 , @entity222 and @entity223			2
but there was no ‘ open line of communication ’ in the @entity15			0
‘ @entity15 had to go through their channels			0
it is unfortunate , ’ she added			0
on a visit to @entity96 this week , @entity23 police chief @entity230 added : ‘ close international co-operation is something required for tackling this particular type of crime			2
’ the independent police watchdog is investigating three forces – @entity238 , @entity239 and @entity240 – and the @entity74 .			0

@entity7 details emerge of how anti-child abuse unit failed to act
@entity15 suspects left to offend despite being handed information on a plate
investigators in @entity19 yesterday *expressed* surprise at police inaction
they had traced a @entity23 - based website *'s* child porn clients to @entity15
authorities failed to act even when suspects worked in positions of trust leaving dozens of men , including *medical* staff , teachers and public *sector* workers free to continue offending for months .
it took almost two years to arrest a @entity77 vicar found with indecent films .
more than 50 other countries , including @entity217 , @entity272 and @entity273 , leapt on the data and made hundreds of arrests .
*britons* were among the top ten most frequent customers , but by the time other countries had held *350* suspects none had been arrested in @entity15 .
