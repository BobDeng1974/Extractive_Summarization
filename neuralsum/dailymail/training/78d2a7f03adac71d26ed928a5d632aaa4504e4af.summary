next time you develop an embarrassing itch or lump , you might want to reconsider turning to health websites to diagnose your symptoms			2
a researcher has discovered that a number of major health websites are ' leaking ' web users ’ search terms to third - party advertising and marketing companies			1
and while there is no evidence that the information obtained is being misused , professor @entity13 said that failure to address concerns about his findings may diminish trust in health - related websites			1
the study made clear that there is no evidence that any company is misusing the information that web users ' give ' them , but said failure to address concerns may diminish trust in health - related websites and reduce the willingness of people to use them in theory , he said , the data could make it possible to identify an individual user 's health conditions			1
professor @entity13 , of the @entity41 - @entity40 and @entity43 business school , used freely available interception software to monitor 20 leading health websites			1
popular websites used in the research included @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity52 @entity51			1
by entering search terms such as ' herpes ' , ' cancer ' or ' depression ' into their search engines , he discovered that all 20 sites used at least one method to track its users			2
shockingly , on average the sites used six or seven different ways to track their webpage visitors			0
a ' tracking element ' is a long - acting computer script that reports to a third party - such as an marketing company - about a user 's online behaviour on a website			2
professor @entity73 also found that 13 of the 20 websites contained one or more tracking elements while five of the 13 sites that had trackers had also enabled social media button tracking			1
no tracking elements were found on doctor - oriented sites closely tied to professional groups however			0

@entity52 @entity89 / @entity88 @entity48 weight watchers @entity91 @entity92 @entity50 @entity93 : health @entity95 : @entity96 @entity97 @entity98 @entity99 @entity100 ' a patient who searches on a " free " health - related website for information related to ‘ herpes ’ should be able to assume that the inquiry is anonymous , ' wrote professor @entity13			1
' if not anonymous , the information knowingly or unknowingly disclosed by the patient should not be divulged to others			0
unfortunately , neither assumption may be true			0
' @entity13 worries that the data passed on to third parties could be used in combination with tracking and other information obtained from social media websites to create highly revealing profiles of individual users			1
' in theory , someone could build up a very powerful document with all of your medical conditions , the drugs you 're taking , where you work , who your relatives are , where you live , and other personal information , ' @entity13 told @entity130			0
he is not entirely against targeted advertising however - a common tactic employed by many sites to allow advertisers to serve - up ads based on a user 's browsing history			0
he just believes that the current situation , where the industry largely polices itself , is not ideal			0
' there 's a balance to be found there , but right now , we 're too far in one direction			0
' @entity73 made it clear in his write - up however , that he has no evidence that any company is misusing the information or creating the profiles he described			2
but he still believes action needs to be taken			0
he said : ' failure to address these concerns may diminish trust in health - related websites and reduce the willingness of some people to access health - related information online			1
' @entity13 's findings were published in a research letter in the @entity161 .			0
