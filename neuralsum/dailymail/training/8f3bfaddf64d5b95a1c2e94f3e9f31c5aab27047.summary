' however , around £ 12.7million has already been paid in fees to the seven banks involved in the privatisation			1
but mps and unions said an extra ' discretionary ' sum of £ 4.2million , which is due to be paid within the next few months , should be blocked			1
banks , such as @entity30 and @entity34 , decided to price @entity4 shares at £ 3.30 each , but they instantly rocketed in value and have remained high ever since			1
last night , the shares closed at £ 5.50			1
the government raised £ 1.7billion from the sale , but would have raised £ 2.9billion if the shares had been sold at last night 's closing price			1
mr @entity41 said to the bankers : ' i 'm hearing an awful lot of sales speak			0
i 'm hearing an awful lot of stuff from you to tell us how wonderful you are ... and what great expertise you have			0
' you have all come together like you are a professional body to defend each other			0

@entity134 , a @entity135 mp on the committee , asked the bankers whether they thought an extra £ 4.2million would be appropriate given the poor deal for the taxpayers			0
