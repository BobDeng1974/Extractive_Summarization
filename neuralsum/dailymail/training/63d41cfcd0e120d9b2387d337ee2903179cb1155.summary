' the case is resolved , ' said @entity56 , a @entity25 lawyer representing @entity24 's estate			1
' i think it was a fair compromise on all sides			2
' @entity56 had argued that @entity24 's estate could n't be sued because @entity13 was an employee of @entity24 and any claims were a worker 's compensation matter			1
vacation : @entity19 , the deceased owner of @entity32 , spoke openly and honestly about the bizarre world she and her animal lived in before the horrific attack happy : miss @entity13 , pictured here with @entity32 , worked for mrs @entity19 performing odd jobs and caring for the animal messages were left today for @entity20 and his lawyer			1

@entity32 had previously bitten another woman 's hand and tried to drag her into a car in 1996 , bit a man 's thumb two years later and escaped from her home and roamed downtown @entity25 for hours before being captured in 2003 , according to the lawsuit			1
