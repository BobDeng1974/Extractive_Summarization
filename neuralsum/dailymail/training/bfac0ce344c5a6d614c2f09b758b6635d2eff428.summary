@entity0 , chairman of @entity1 and the country ’s leading anti-discrimination campaigner , has been given the ideal platform to discuss the @entity7 - @entity6 controversy at @entity8			1
lord @entity0 is one of the key - note speakers at the @entity11 ’s annual management conference on tuesday at the @entity12			1
the summit , at which sir @entity14 and @entity15 are also speaking , is being billed as how leadership , health and wellbeing contribute to elite performance			1
but @entity0 will not miss the chance to tell the star - studded audience that change has to happen after a number of recent anti- discriminatory issues which the football authorities have tried to brush under the carpet			1
@entity0 will be speaking at the @entity11 's annual management conference on tuesday not least the @entity11 , who invited @entity0 to their event after the storm of criticism that greeted managers ’ union chief executive @entity33 cluelessly describing @entity7 ’s exchange of racist , sexist and homophobic tweets as ‘ letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter ’			1
meanwhile , @entity8 chairman @entity6 , who says he will quit the club if the @entity40 even suggest he is guilty of racism , has until tomorrow to reply to them about his offensive comments about @entity45 and @entity46 people when defending his appointment of manager @entity7			1
@entity8 chairman @entity6 ( right ) recently appointed @entity7 as manager the blunder of printing a photo of the wrong @entity52 president in the 2008 @entity53 vs @entity55 programme caused meltdown among the @entity58 blazers			1
it was not great , therefore , that the programme welcome from current president @entity61 for saturday ’s @entity53 vs @entity64 game @entity62 expected a lively encounter ‘ this afternoon ’ when the match kicked off at 7pm			2
heads have rolled for less , especially as @entity69 ’s own rugby memorabilia collection includes programmes with the botched presidential picture of @entity72 and one of the few printed with the correct face , @entity76			2
@entity77 ( left ) has resigned from @entity40 ’s referee academy the @entity40 banned @entity79 after he told young referee @entity80 that a women ’s place is in the kitchen @entity83 referee @entity77 resigned from @entity40 ’s referee academy in protest at the county @entity40 not taking further action against dinosaur vice-president @entity79			2
the @entity40 banned @entity79 for four months after telling young referee @entity80 ( right ) , @entity77 ’s partner , that a women ’s place is in the kitchen			0
caught in the middle is @entity77 ’s father @entity91 , @entity92 ceo whose son ’s resignation is one of five			0
@entity98 chairman @entity97 ’s seven - year reign is expected to end next march			1
the current belief is that @entity97 will not stand for re-election , paving the way for @entity103 ’s ambitious @entity102 to take the helm , although @entity97 would remain on the @entity105			1
@entity102 , whose cheerleaders within the @entity98 include chief operating officer @entity107 and commercial director @entity108 , might face a candidate from outside the game but would be an overwhelming favourite			2
however , if @entity97 does a @entity112 – turn @entity102 would not oppose him			2
@entity98 chairman @entity97 's seven - year reign is expected to end in march ticket site making waves @entity116 , the official ticketing partners of @entity62 2015 , have bought @entity118 , who are one of the secondary ticket online operators @entity120 are desperate to curb with @entity123 legislation			1
@entity116 already have get me in under their umbrella but want to increase trade in the secondary market — despite the conflict of interest with their @entity131 partnership which one ticketing chief described as ‘ unbelievable in its hyprocrisy ’			0
@entity120 say @entity118 have removed all references to @entity131 tickets from their site			0
@entity139 personnel have made a habit of sending out joke tweets that could easily be misinterpreted despite the 24/7 scrutiny of the @entity143 — not least by their own tv station			0
so director ’s assistant @entity145 is the latest to find herself in hot water at @entity148 for posting a saucy @entity149 with the message ‘ would you like some p * * * * with your coffee ’			0
@entity139 said the post had been taken down and @entity155 reminded about social media perils			0
@entity157 are strapped for cash to the extent they have ditched their commentary of the @entity163 final because the organisers have asked for a rights fee			0
a @entity157 spokesperson said : ‘ our budget does not allow us			0
’ @entity157 have ditched their commentary of the @entity163 final			0
