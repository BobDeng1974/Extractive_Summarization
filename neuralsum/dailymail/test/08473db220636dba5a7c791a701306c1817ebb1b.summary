@entity1 midfielder @entity0 was left with mixed emotions after scoring the best goal of his career only to end up a loser at @entity6			1
@entity0 netted one of the most memorable goals in @entity10 history as he lobbed @entity12 goalkeeper @entity11 from 66 yards on the stroke of half - time			1
that levelled the scores up at 1 - 1 , but @entity0 's wonder strike would end up counting for nothing as @entity12 snatched a second - half winner to leave @entity1 nursing a third successive league loss			1
@entity0 ( centre ) lets fly from inside his own half as he scores one of the goals of his career at @entity12 @entity11 watches on as he is unable to stop @entity0 's shot from hitting the back of the net for 1 - 1 @entity1 ended up losing 2 - 1 at @entity6 as @entity29 ( left ) scored the winner for @entity12 and while @entity0 was understandably proud of his ' incredible ' goal , the @entity32 international admits the main thing for him is how the team get on and he was quick to turn his focus to next weekend 's clash with @entity39			1
asked if it was the greatest goal of his career , @entity0 said on @entity42 : ' of course			2
it 's an incredible strike , it 's a nice goal to score but the important thing for us is winning the game			0
' it 's three on the bounce we 've lost now , which is bad , but hopefully we can improve on that next week against @entity39			0
' on an individual level it 's great , but on a team performance it was ok and there 's a lot that we can improve on for next week			0
' @entity0 ( second left ) admitted he had mixed emotions after scoring the goal but losing the game @entity1 manager @entity59 has seen his side lose in their last three @entity10 encounters @entity39 are currently ninth in the standings , one spot ahead of @entity1 , but both teams have 42 points			2
@entity0 added : ' it 's going to be a tough game			2
they 're in and around us as well			0
if we can win that will keep us in the top 10 , a few points ahead of them and hopefully we can do that with two homes games to come			0
