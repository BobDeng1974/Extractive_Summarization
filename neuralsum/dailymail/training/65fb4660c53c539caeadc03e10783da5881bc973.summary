by @entity0 control : a new mobile service is promising parents total control over how their children use their phones , from the websites they visit to the times of day the handset is on parent will soon be able to read their children ’s text messages , control who they speak to and turn their phones on or off – no matter where they are			1
a new mobile service is promising mothers and fathers total control over how their children use their phones , from the websites they visit to the times of day the handset is on			1
mobile phone company @entity19 has created the service , which will run on the @entity22 network , to appeal to parents worried about text bullying , sexting and the disruptive use of phones in schools			1
campaigners say the phone deal , which is intended for children between eight and 16 , hands power back to parents			2
the move follows the @entity36 ’s campaign for internet service providers to protect children by automatically blocking access to pornographic content , with adults having to ‘ opt in ’ if they want to view sexual material			1
until now , any restrictions on children ’s mobile phone use have had to be made using the parental control options on the handset itself			1
these settings can be difficult and time - consuming to negotiate , and many parents do not know they exist			2
parents signed up to @entity53 ’s system , however , can set restrictions for their child ’s phone using a web page that only they can access			1
the site is linked directly to the phone ’s sim card , so if a child wants to add a friend as a contact they have to ask the parent , who can then use the website to decide whether or not to allow the change			1
pleased : @entity68 , chief executive of the @entity69 , said ' parents have been wanting something like this for a very long time ' all messages that are sent and received by the child can be viewed by the parents by logging on to the site , even if the child deletes them from the phone			1
parents can also set a timer so that the phone can not be switched on during lessons or late at night , for example			2
however , calls to the parents ’ phones can be made at all times			0
the pay - as - you - go sim cards are available from @entity89 ’s website from today and from @entity90 later this month , with the parental control service costing from £ 2.95 per month			2
campaigners are now calling on other phone networks to introduce similar services			2
‘ parents being able to read texts means if bullying is going on they will be alerted straight off and can deal with it straight away			0
' now we need a joined up effort across all networks and all industries			0
’ @entity19 founder @entity103 said : ‘ unlike an app , @entity53 ’s @entity104 will work on any mobile device or tablet , and most importantly can not be bypassed by the child			1
’ but @entity109 , director of privacy group @entity110 , warned : ‘ giving parents the tools to control what their kids can do with smartphones is a good thing , but this is a step too far			0
‘ if there are problems with what young people are using their phones for the way to fix them is not to have parents spying			0
’ @entity126 is considering lifting a ban on children using its site – despite fears it could put youngsters at risk of bullying or grooming by sexual predators			0
the site , which has 900million active members worldwide , does not allow under - 13s to join			0
but the company 's head of policy in @entity144 , @entity141 , said restrictions may be eased as many younger children already use the social network by lying about their ages			1
he said : ' some seem to be doing it with their parents ’ permission and help			0
' we have a strict under - 13 rule because of legal issues in @entity157			0
we apply the same rule all over the world			0
' but actually a lot of parents are not only happy that their kids are on it , but they are helping them be on it			0
