by @entity0 a terrified patient woke up in ' agony ' during an operation being performed by an hiv - positive dentist who was later struck off the register			1
@entity6 claims he could have contracted the virus after he was given a general anaesthetic by disgraced @entity10 dentist @entity9 - who was n’t even qualified to knock people out			1
@entity9 was struck off the dental register in july for lying about having @entity13			1
mr @entity6 , 52 , requested the anaesthetic for a 2007 root canal treatment and fillings because of his fear of needles and so paid £ 100 in advance for a specialist anaesthetist to visit and ensure he was not awake			1
patient @entity6 said he was ' frozen with fear ' when he woke up during the root canal procedure but after a 40 minute wait the anaesthetist failed to turn up and @entity9 took the situation into his own hands			1
half an hour in to the procedure , he woke up in intense pain before @entity9 rushed to give him more anaesthetic			1
he said : ' you can imagine my horror when i woke up to find him still working in my mouth			2
' he now faces an @entity13 test with his doctor with more needles and has complained to the @entity38			0
@entity9 refused to comment when confronted at his @entity40 home , despite some of his former patients remaining un-traced for @entity13 tests			2
mr @entity6 said : ' when i read about this doctor hiding his @entity13 from patients i was horrified			1
' he put my life at risk by doing the anaesthetic himself and i will pursue him legally as far as i can take it now			2
' not only will i have to go through a test for @entity13 where i ’ll have to face a needle but i now know that this man was n’t even qualified to perform a general anaesthetic on me which is more worrying			2
' this is a complicated procedure even for a qualified anaesthetist because if you do n’t get the levels right you can kill someone			2
' i sat in the waiting room for 40 minutes but he did n’t turn up			0
he took me into his room , sat me on the chair and administered it himself			0
' i had no idea what was going on and i was completely knocked out			0
' when i woke up half - way through he then got this massive needle and injected more anaesthetic into my gums			1
' i was frozen with fear and i ’ll never forget that day for the rest of my life			0
' on the way out he handed me the £ 100 back but it was such a terrible experience i never went back to him			0
@entity75 surgery in @entity10 where @entity9 worked before he was struck off the register ' this guy had obviously given me too little of the stuff and i woke up in the middle of it all			1
he could just as easily have given me too much and killed me			0
' to lie about having @entity13 is bad enough but to carry out life - threatening procedures without being properly qualified is out of order			2
' i ’m absolutely terrified of having an hiv test , not because i fear i may have @entity13 , but because i will have to face a needle			0
' a spokesperson for @entity40 and @entity86 said the vast majority of @entity9 's patients had been contacted to inform them of his hiv - status			1
' there were people who we could not trace because they had moved from the area and we conducted a public awareness campaign in the hope these people would present for testing			0
' ultimately , however , it was down to a personal decision by individuals on whether to respond to our appeal for testing			0
' some 10,000 people have been tested and not a single person was found to have caught @entity13 as a result of medical or dental treatment			0
