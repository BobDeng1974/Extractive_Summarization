orbiting earth at this very moment are thousands of chunks of space junk that pose a threat to satellites and spacecraft alike			1
to monitor this debris @entity7 is planning to launch a military space force by 2019 that will be tasked with protecting satellites			1
the initial goal of this new division will be to track the various pieces of junk and prevent satellites being damaged or destroyed by collisions in future			1
in five years @entity7 will assemble a space force to monitor junk in @entity22 orbit			1
the unit will use telescope and radar facilities in @entity7 's @entity27 region			1
it will be made up of personnel from the country 's @entity30 with their @entity33 aircraft picturing performing a flyover during an inspection parade in 2010 since the first object , @entity38 1 , was launched into space 53 years ago , mankind has created a swarm of hundreds of thousands of items of debris			2
the rubbish circling the planet comes from old rockets , abandoned satellites and missile shrapnel			0
there are around 22,000 objects in orbit that are big enough for officials on the ground to track and countless more smaller ones that could do damage to human - carrying spaceships and valuable satellites			0
one major source of debris in the past was a @entity61 anti-satellite missile test in 2007 that left an estimated 150,000 pieces of junk in the atmosphere			0
accidental events have also contributed to the problem			0
in 2009 for instance there was a major crash between a @entity71 communications satellite and a defunct @entity73 military probe over @entity74			2
space junk is a growing problem for travel into the cosmos			1
according to @entity81 more than 500,000 pieces of debris are orbiting @entity22 at speeds of more than 17,500 miles ( 28,000 kilometres ) per hour			1
at this speed a piece as small as a golf ball could smash a satellite to pieces			0
some have even suggested we may be heading towards a ‘ @entity90 ’ - type event			0
this was envisaged in the 2013 movie gravity , which portrayed a satellite collision that sparked a chain reaction where debris increasingly impacted other satellites , creating more debris in the process			0
this has led many companies and agencies to draw up plans to reduce the amount of space debris in @entity22 orbit , such as proposals to drag debris down with magnetic nets or lasers			1
the @entity111 - based @entity110 , meanwhile , could grab larger pieces of debris or defunct satellites with a ‘ claw ’ at its front before dragging it back down to burn up in the atmosphere			0
space junk ( illustration shown ) is a growing problem for travel into the cosmos			1
according to @entity81 more than 500,000 pieces of debris are orbiting @entity22 at speeds of over 17,500 miles ( 28,000 kilometres ) per hour			1
at this speed a piece as small as a golf ball could smash a satellite to pieces pictured is a hole caused by orbital debris that was found in @entity81 's @entity134 when it was serviced aboard @entity135 in 1984			2
the @entity22 - orbiting satellite launched on 14 february 1980 to observe the sun and re-entered the atmosphere in 1989 @entity7 ’s decision to dedicate part of its national defense to cleaning up @entity22 orbit will therefore be a welcome development for worried engineers			1
the move follows @entity7 ’s decision in 2008 to allow military activities in space			0
the space force will be part of a partnership with the @entity71 , as the two seek to cooperate in space , referred to as the ‘ fourth battlefield ’ by a source in the @entity156			1
the unit will use radar and telescope facilities jointly with the science ministry and the @entity161 ( @entity161 ) to run its observatory operations			2
these will likely be the radar and telescope facilities in @entity27 operated by @entity165 - based think - tank @entity164			2
and the space force may be composed of personnel from the @entity168 , the country ’s air force			2
if will also provide the @entity71 military with information gleaned from the operation			0
what the goals of the space force will be beyond monitoring space junk , however , is not yet known			1
some have suggested we may be heading towards a ‘ @entity90 ’ - type event			0
this was envisaged in the @entity181 ( poster shown ) , which portrayed a satellite collision that sparked a chain reaction where debris increasingly impacted other satellites , creating more debris in the process			0
there are around 22,000 objects in orbit ( illustration shown ) that are big enough for officials on the ground to track and countless more smaller ones that could do damage to human - carrying spaceships and valuable satellites			0

in five years @entity7 will assemble a space force to monitor junk in @entity22 orbit
the unit will use telescope and radar facilities in @entity7 's @entity27 region
initial goal of the force will be to track the *potentially* *dangerous* pieces of space junk in @entity22 orbit
this will be a cooperation with the @entity71 in what is called the ' fourth battlefield '
space junk is a growing problem for satellite operators with more than 500,000 pieces thought to be a threat
