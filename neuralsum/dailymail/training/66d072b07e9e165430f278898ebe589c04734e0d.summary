the term ‘ @entity1 ’ should be abandoned , say politicians who are calling for an extraordinary rebranding exercise			2
mps on the science and technology select committee has demanded a ‘ reframing of the public conversation ’ about genetically modified food			1
in an inflammatory report today , it says the @entity12 label has become a ‘ lightning rod ’ for fears about designer crops			1
@entity16 : mps on the science and technology select committee say @entity12 crops , like this field of @entity12 wheat , should be rebranded because the term has become a ‘ lightning rod ’ for fears about designer crops it says the term should be reserved for plants created using the most basic form of genetic engineering , with many newer methods excluded			1
anti-gm groups accused mps of trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the public			0
@entity34 , of the @entity35 , who gave evidence to the committee during its inquiry , said : ‘ this is probably the most ridiculous recommendation to come out of any select committee in this entire @entity41			0
it ’s insulting to the public to suggest they can be fooled that easily			1
’ some fear that ‘ frankenfoods ’ could alter ecosystems and have hidden effects on human health			1
no @entity12 food has ever been commercially grown in @entity51 , kept out by a labyrinthine @entity53 system that makes it difficult to get the required environmental licences			1
but @entity51 scientists and farmers have been campaigning for years to make the process easier			0
the latest report repeats their calls and urges the government to change its terminology			0
it says : ‘ @entity12			2
is now often used imprecisely to encompass a whole range of technologies			0
we recommend that the government initiate a reframing of the public conversation by moving away from the overly simple notion of “ @entity12 ” in its policies and communications			2
’ the authors say the term @entity12 should only be used to describe ‘ first - generation ’ techniques – in which genes are taken out of one plant and moved into another			1
biologists can now work on a much finer level , editing individual strands of a plant ’s dna			0
too perfect ? a farmer compares two corncobs of @entity87 's genetically engineered corn , right , with two normal corncobs on a field near the village of @entity91 north of @entity92 , in this 2007 file photo the report claims the label @entity12 ‘ fails to accurately portray ’ these more modern techniques			1
it adds : ‘ the term “ @entity12 ” has become a lightning rod for much broader public anxiety			2
there is a need to reframe and widen the public debate to encourage a more productive conversation			0
’ @entity105 mp @entity104 , who chairs the committee , accused anti-gm groups of propagating ‘ false claims ’ and ‘ misleading statements regarding safety ’			2
he said : ‘ the scientific evidence is clear that crops developed using genetic modification pose no more risk to humans , animals or the environment than equivalent crops developed using more “ conventional ” techniques			0
’ yesterday @entity120 , the @entity121 farming minister , told the @entity123 conference in @entity124 that there was a need to have a ‘ grown - up conversation ’ about @entity12 , adding : ‘ we should be growing these crops , and we should n’t allow non-scientific arguments to muddy the debate			1
’ but @entity132 , of the campaign group @entity133 , insisted the proposal was ludicrous			0
‘ arguing about the semantics is just a smokescreen , ’ she said			0
‘ all of the crops that are currently producing food and all the ones waiting in line within the @entity53 approvals process are first - generation @entity12 ‘ looking at what ’s coming out of the lab , it is vital to remember any attempt to artificially engineer @entity82 can cause unexpected and unpredictable effects			1

critic says its ' insulting to the public to suggest they can be fooled '
some fear ‘ frankenfoods ’ could alter ecosystems and affect health
@entity53 laws have stopped @entity12 food from being commercially grown in @entity51
but mps say new techniques have rendered old *definition* misleading
