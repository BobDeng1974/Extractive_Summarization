a five - year - old boy who became an internet sensation after repeatedly using the word ' apparently ' during a tv interview has now scored his own commercial			1
@entity5 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , who found fame following an interview with @entity11 last month , is the star of an advert for @entity13 , which makes refrigerated pet food			1
' apparently this is my first ever tv commercial , ' he says to the camera			1
the charming youngster plays with dogs and speaks confidently into the microphone as he extols the virtues of the pet food - with a little help from his favorite word			1
' he wants to eat it every night , every day			0
apparently now that 's good food ! ' at one point in the commercial , which appears to be largely unscripted , the little boy tells viewers to call him - before giving out his telephone number			2
' just call the apparently kid when you see this commercial , ' he says			2
' bye and apparently ! ' @entity5 became an internet sensation after giving a hilarious interview with @entity11 at the @entity45 in august and was later invited to appear on the @entity46			1
acting up : during the commercial , @entity5 pretends to be a dog - and uses his favorite word , of course adorable : the youngster giggles as he plays with two puppies during the advert for @entity13 in the @entity11 video , a newscaster is seen approaching him on the opening day of the fair in @entity60 and asking him what he thought of a new ride			1
' it was great and apparently i 've never been on live television but apparently sometimes i do n't watch the news because i 'm a kid and apparently every time @entity67 just gives me the remote i have to watch the @entity69 , ' he said loudly into the microphone			0
the news reporter pushes him further , asking him again for his view on the ride			0
' well , it was great because apparently you 're spinning around and apparently every time you get dizzy , that 's all you do is get dizzy , ' he said			0
' i 've never ever been on live television			0
' @entity78 - in - the - making : @entity5 was discovered at a fair in @entity7 last month when a news reporter asked him for his view on a new ride - and he used the word ' apparently ' eight times in 90 seconds fan : he appeared on the @entity86 show last week and revealed he now prefers the word ' seriously ' @entity5 used the word ' apparently ' no less than eight times during the one - and - a - half - minute interview , and repeated that he had never been on live television three times			1
later speaking with the today show , he admitted he did n't even know what the word meant			0
' no , i do n't know how to spell " apparently " , ' he said			0
' i do n't know what it means , but i use it in , " wow , this is apparently annoying "			0
' and last week , @entity5 appeared on the @entity46 , where he looked at ease as he chatted with the bemused host - and told her that he now has a new favorite word , ' seriously ' .			2
