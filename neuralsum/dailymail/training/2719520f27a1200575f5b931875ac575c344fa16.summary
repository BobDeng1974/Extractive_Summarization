@entity0 has described it as the ' toughest decision of my life ' after announcing he will leave @entity5			1
as the tributes for @entity0 poured in from his team - mates on friday morning , it was left to @entity9 to offer some words of warning to the @entity5 hierarchy			2
' @entity12 can do anything , he 's an amazing player , ' said the @entity15 striker			0
' it 's going to be very difficult for the team to find another player like him in the future			0
' @entity0 's level of performance may have dipped quite dramatically at times this season but @entity9 has a point			2
how does @entity25 go about replacing arguably the club 's most iconic figure when he departs @entity28 - most likely for @entity29 - this summer ? @entity0 and his potential successor as @entity5 captain , @entity31 , at @entity32 on friday @entity0 has announced that he will leave @entity5 when his contract expires at the end of the season @entity0 opens the scoring for @entity5 from the penalty spot during their 2 - 2 draw with @entity39 at @entity28 former @entity40 midfielder @entity0 stretches to knock the ball away from @entity39 's @entity42 ( left ) @entity43 : 494 appearances , 116 goals @entity46 : 39 appearances , 13 goals @entity49 : 28 appearances , 9 goals @entity52 : 87 appearances , 30 goals @entity55 / @entity55 : 42 appearances , 11 goals other : 5 appearances , 1 goal total : 695 appearances , 180 goals well , he might not have to			1
@entity31 , like many of @entity25 ' squad , has struggled for form since last season 's blistering campaign saw @entity5 come agonisingly close to their first @entity43 title			2
but the 24 - year - old has n't become a bad player overnight			1
in fact , with the energy levels of a young @entity0 , an eye for a pass and a tenacity to his game , @entity31 's potential could well prevent @entity5 splashing the cash on a new central midfielder			1
@entity25 clearly believes the former @entity81 midfielder has the leadership qualities required to inspire his team - mates in similar fashion , having named him as the club 's vice captain back in september			1
@entity31 is known to have a good rapport with the rest of the squad - particularly @entity90 and @entity91 - and is not afraid to offer guidance and advice to young players despite his own tender years			2
midfielder @entity31 ( right ) looks set to replace @entity0 ( left ) as @entity5 captain next season @entity31 hugs his captain after @entity0 's second successful penalty against @entity39 on @entity100 he gets on well with his manager and @entity25 will often call him over during games to explain instructions , trusting him to pass them on to the rest of the team			1
having already captained the @entity108 in the absence of @entity0 this season , it will be a natural progression for @entity31 to take over the role full - time at the start of next season			2
he is accustomed to the responsibility , having worn the armband for @entity40 's under 21 side before making the step up to the @entity40 ' senior squad			0
after being excused from a friendly against @entity119 in 2011 , @entity31 decided to stay behind and help organise a night of team bonding instead of travelling home			0
he understands the importance of togetherness , just like @entity0			0
and just like the @entity125 ' departing skipper , @entity31 is also a model professional			0
he turns up early for training , works hard and ensures he is in the best possible condition come matchday			0
@entity31 , who is @entity5 's vice captain , is expected to step up and take over from @entity0 next season @entity31 has an effort at goal against @entity39 but his shot is saved by goalkeeper @entity133 but it 's not just off the pitch that @entity31 shares similarities with his former @entity40 team - mate			1
after a difficult start to life at @entity28 , the @entity81 - born midfielder has blossomed into one of @entity25 ' star performers and an influential figure for both club and country			0
although shunted out wide too much this season , @entity31 showed last term that he has all the qualities needed to be an effective box - to - box player , just like @entity0 was at his best			1
he may not be as prolific in front of goal as his more senior colleague but , with more assists ( five ) , tackles made ( 47 ) and a greater crossing and corner accuracy than @entity0 this season , @entity31 is capable of cementing his place in @entity5 's midfield for the next decade			1
@entity0 ( right ) consoles @entity31 after @entity5 's 1 - 1 @entity52 draw with @entity158 in december @entity31 runs towards @entity0 to celebrate scoring against @entity160 in late november gerrard himself saw @entity31 's raw talent when @entity5 spent Â£ 20million to bring him to @entity28 three - and - a - half years ago			1
speaking to the @entity163 in june 2011 , @entity0 said : ' it 's a really positive signing			0
let 's hope he is the next @entity0			0
' @entity5 needs a new @entity0 and it will need a new @entity167			2
that 's what good football clubs do - they replace their best players			0
' after 695 games , 180 goals and 10 trophies so far , @entity0 will leave behind a pair of huge boots to fill when he calls time on @entity5 career at the end of this season			1
luckily for @entity25 and the @entity28 faithful , the man to step into them may already be in their ranks .			0

@entity0 will leave @entity5 at the end of this season
@entity31 shares similar leadership qualities to @entity0
he also has the energy and *ability* to take his place in central midfield
@entity0 hopes 24 - year - old @entity31 will be his long - term replacement
