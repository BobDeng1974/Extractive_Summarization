by @entity0 the running out of @entity2 at @entity3 was absolutely fine			1
i have no problem with it			2
there is no ‘ @entity9 ’ issue for me			2
@entity10 had clearly warned @entity2 about backing up too far - and according to the laws he does n’t have to do that - and it does n’t matter that he was n’t charging down the pitch			1
the @entity16 man was out of his ground			0
of course it was an unsavoury scene and everybody involved in the game would have wondered what they might have done			0
what you need is a strong captain who is able to step back and take the heat out of it			0
controversial : @entity10 appeals to the umpire for a run out of @entity2 at the non strikers end if it had been me in @entity33 ’ shoes , i might have gone up to the batsman and said , ‘ look , you ’ve been warned and you ’ve done it again			1
you have put me in a really difficult situation here because you are out			0
i might just give you one more chance but if you do it again i ’m sending you packing			0
’ i do n’t blame @entity33 for not doing that but he could have bought himself time by having a look round at his senior players , because there was a lot of experience out there in former captains @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52			1
but he decided to make the call himself and that ’s fine			2
things had been a bit tasty out there from the start , with the @entity59 questioning the umpires ’ calling of wides			0
they looked like a team who had a bit of an issue - and perhaps the reporting of @entity10 for a suspect action was the key to what happened on tuesday			1
not happy : @entity2 reacts after being run out by @entity71 's @entity10			1

@entity2 was ran out at @entity3 against @entity71
@entity10 had clearly warned @entity2 about backing up too far
@entity33 could have looked round at senior players but made the call himself
