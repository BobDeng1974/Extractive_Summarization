by @entity0 speaking out : @entity1 has told for the first time of the terrifying moment she was doused in acid by two strangers as @entity1 enjoyed an evening stroll through the streets of @entity8 with a friend , she did not give the moped which pulled up beside her a second thought			1
for the sight was not uncommon and she was full of happiness after what had so far been the best day of the @entity17 student 's month - long stint working with underprivileged children on the @entity20 island			2
but miss @entity1 and her friend @entity1 were suddenly , and without provocation , doused in battery acid by two strangers in a horrific attack which shocked the world			1
for the first time , the north @entity26 teenager has spoken of her ordeal and revealed that despite the mindless brutality of what happened to her last month , she plans to return next year to continue with her charity work			1
she also reveals how she is haunted by questions as to why she and @entity33 were attacked , saying : ' since my return to @entity17 i have asked myself the same questions every day : why us ? why were @entity1 and i targeted ? what motivated our attackers ? had they been following us our watching us for a while before they decided to carry out their unprovoked assault ? ' she admits that the clothes she took with her to zanzibar - shorts , strappy tops and mini-skirts - were wholly inappropriate for a trip to a @entity51 country during the holy month of @entity52			1
but the teenager insists that this was done in ignorance and she immediately rectified it by buying lots of modest attire , including baggy trousers that both she and @entity33 were wearing when they were attacked.in an article for the @entity62 , she said the friends did nothing to draw the wrong sort of attention to them and their behaviour was entirely respectable during their month - long stay			0
victims : @entity1 , pictured left , and @entity1 , both 18 , from @entity72 , north @entity26 , were walking to a restaurant in @entity8 when two men on a moped threw a jerry can full of battery acid at them ' we laughed , sang , and enjoyed every moment we had in @entity8 , all within the confines of what was religiously acceptable on the island , ' she added			1
' there we were , two 18 - year - old @entity86 girls from north @entity26 hoping to make some difference in the world while enjoying the life we 've been given			2
' painful : this photograph released by the teenagers ' families showed the injuries one of them suffered in the attack miss @entity1 , who is about to commence a history degree at @entity98 , said the first she knew something was amiss was when the moped driver stared at them intently , before nodding suggestively to the passenger sat behind			1
she said the man smiled and then violently threw a jerry can full of battery acid at them - dousing both girls in a clear liquid which they initially mistook for water			2
she said : ' within a second of the moped speeding off , with its tail - light still in sight , we began screaming			0
' our screams were not out of frustration that our clothes had been drenched			0
they were screams of agony			0
we felt our flesh being seared			0
' as locals rushed to help , a disinterested soldier stood nearby watching as the girls lay on the floor writhing in agony - tearing at their skin and clothes in a futile bid to abate the pain			0
' my entire upper body was burning , especially the right shoulder and torso , ' she added			0
' so were my feet , my face and my eyes			0
the skin on my right forearm looked as though it had had red paint thrown on it and i immediately noticed some discolouration on my torso and shoulder			0
' the pain , coupled with the taste of the fluid flung at us - as part of which had spattered into my mouth - made me quickly realise that it was not water			0
' mercifully , miss @entity1 was carried into the nearby @entity149 by three men			1
the teenagers ran to the @entity152 ( pictured ) after the attack by two men on mopeds @entity1 , looked drained and scared as she arrived at hospital after the attack in @entity8 @entity1 was comforted by a fellow traveller as she was driven to hospital in @entity160 the teenage volunteer appears to be in pain as she is taken to hospital alongside a male friend she said : ' i jumped in the water in my bra and briefs and began scrubbing my body with my hands			1
the pain was rapidly intensifying at a much faster pace than i could each burning area of my body			0
' i caught a glimpse of the holes that had burnt into my clothes , which the young man was still holding			0
' it became obvious to me that @entity1 and i had become the victims of a chemical attack			1
' the girls were then taken to woefully underequipped local hospital , before a hotel where their ' seared ' skin was treated by standing them under cold showers			0
' a few hours later they were airlifted to hospital in mainland @entity160 , before being flown back to the @entity17			2
stop off : @entity1 and @entity1 were flown to the @entity186 in @entity160 ( pictured ) before being flown back to the @entity17 @entity160 president @entity187 visited the two women in hospital and called the attack ' shameful ' she spent weeks at @entity191 and @entity192 undergoing skin grafts before being released			1
her friend @entity33 , whose burns were more severe , is still an in - patient			0
recalling her initial thoughts after the attack , she said : ' i thought about @entity200 , the former model and television presenter who had had sulphuric acid thrown in her face on the orders of her ex-boyfriend and the impact that had on her life			2
' i was terrified and still in pain , crying , wishing i was back home in @entity72 , north @entity26 , along with @entity210 and @entity211 , my two brothers and our two dogs			2
' miss @entity1 also reveals that @entity215 has written to her praising her efforts in trying to make a ' real difference to the lives of children '			1
she writes : ' with each day that passes i reflect on my time in @entity8 with @entity1 and the fun we had ... such happy memories have convinced me to return to the island next year to do more voluntary work			1
' care : the two teenagers were both taken to @entity191 and @entity192 after returning to the @entity17 ' @entity228 imagination ' : the teenage girls were covered by sheets as they were escorted out of an ambulance and into the hospital attack : two men on a moped hurled acid in the girls ' faces as they walked to meet friends for dinner in @entity241 , @entity8 ( seen in a file photo )			1
