@entity1 manager @entity0 believes filling your home ground is paramount to @entity5 clubs - with the @entity1 announcing their new season - ticket structure ahead of the move to the @entity8			1
@entity9 , vice-chairman of @entity1 , announced during the week that the club would be making significant cuts to their current pricing as the move is being offset against increased television revenue			2
the cheapest season ticket at @entity15 is £ 620 but there will be £ 289 seats on offer from the 2016 - 17 season - the club 's first in the 54,000 - seater @entity8			1
@entity1 's season tickets will cost as little as £ 289 when the club move to the @entity8 next year manager @entity0 says filling the stadium is the most important thing for any football club @entity1 's vice-chairman @entity9 visited the club 's future home in @entity27 on tuesday and @entity0 believes performing in front of a sold - out crowd is something that should not go unappreciated as the other 19 @entity5 clubs are now being pushed to follow @entity1 's lead			1
' the most important thing at a football club is to fill the stadium , ' he said			2
' i think filling the stadium is the ultimate for the success of the team			0
obviously it 's not from a revenue base like it used to be			0
' the revenue base for a football club used to be the sustainability of the football club in my years before the @entity5 and before @entity45 made it a worldwide brand			0
a view of the @entity8 on tuesday ahead of @entity1 's switch to the 54,000 - capacity arena ' it 's about creating the atmosphere in a stadium that thrills not only the fans there enjoying the atmosphere , but the players who respond to that ' to make sure everywhere you go in the @entity5 maintains a high level of attendance and selling out your stadium has to be the ultimate goal for any @entity5 football club , for me			1
an artist 's impression of what the @entity8 will look like during a @entity1 match ' what we 've announced has to be the best piece of business , for me , seen in the @entity5 for a long , long time			2
' hopefully everybody at @entity1 football club , particularly the fan , will come and enjoy , as @entity9 says , a fantastic facility for less			0
that will only encourage future young @entity1 supporters to be @entity1 supporters			0
