by @entity0 published : 11:48 est , 27 march 2013 updated : 12:55 est , 27 march 2013 @entity2 tourists who booked a weekend ' mini-cruise ' to @entity4 spent just six minutes in the @entity6 capital after their overnight ferry crossing turned into a 30 - hour journey from hell			1
more than 300 people booked the Â£ 48 - a - head break to the @entity6 , which should have entailed them arriving in @entity11 at 9am last saturday and spending all day in @entity4 before boarding an 11pm boat home			1
but after they boarded the @entity16 service from @entity17 on friday afternoon , their boat was lashed by such high winds and rough seas that their arrival at the @entity6 port of @entity22 was delayed by 13 hours			1
passengers on the @entity16 endured a nightmare journey to @entity11 as the ship was battered by high winds and rough seas instead of arriving at 9am on saturday , the weary - not to mention nauseous - passengers did not reach land til 10pm			1
they then had to board a coach to take them to the @entity31 so they could take an alternative @entity34 ferry route back to the @entity2			1
@entity35 , 25 , from @entity17 , went on the cruise with ten of his friends and said they spent a total of 45 hours travelling and just six minutes in @entity4			1
he said : ' there were about 350 round - trip passengers like us on the ferry			1
' when we set off on friday , it was blowing a gale , and then an hour into the journey , i think it was about gale force eight or nine			0
' we did n't get there until 11pm on saturday night			2
we spent about six minutes in the ferry terminal carpark in @entity4 before they took us onto coaches			1
' we thought we were going to see @entity11 , but they just drove us to the @entity31 and put us on a ferry to @entity56			2
the tourists had been looking forward to seeing the canals and shops of @entity4 , pictured ' we did n't even get a cabin			2
we just had to sit there			0
everything was out of control			0
' after arriving in @entity56 at 10pm on sunday , the passengers were taken by coach to @entity17 , arriving at 4.30am on monday morning			2
amusement arcade manager @entity35 said : ' i wish i 'd never bothered			0
i think i 've done more miles than @entity68			0
' the annoying thing is i do n't think they the ferry should have left - they would have known about the weather			2
@entity74 , 31 , paid to fly home rather than go endure another nightmare crossing father - of - one @entity74 , 31 , who runs an electroplating business in @entity79 , @entity80 , said : ' it was horrendous - i still feel like i 'm on a boat			2
we should never have set off , people were being sick all over the place			0
' i was on a stag do with a group of lads and ended up getting off on the sunday morning and paying to fly home as i had an important meeting to get to on monday			0
' they 've offered us another trip but i never want to get on a boat again			0
' @entity95 , @entity96 @entity2 passenger director , said : ' i would like to apologise to all passengers who were affected by our delayed mini cruise sailing on our @entity4 route on friday , march 22			1
' the delay was caused by unpredicted severe adverse weather conditions on the @entity103 , which resulted in the outbound crossing of @entity16 from @entity105 being delayed			0
' our primary focus at @entity96 is always on passenger safety			0
our crew and shore - based team worked hard to ensure our passengers were able to make their way home as quickly and safely as possible , whilst endeavouring to keep them informed of the situation throughout			1
' as a result , our passengers disembarked on sunday morning and were transported to the @entity31 to travel back to @entity56 via another ferry service			1
' they then continued by coach back to @entity105			0
we have offered all passengers affected by the delayed sailing the opportunity to take their mini cruise at another time convenient to them			0

@entity2 tourists hoped to spend all day on saturday in @entity6 capital
