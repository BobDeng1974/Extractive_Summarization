by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 03:58 est , 1 october 2013 updated : 03:58 est , 1 october 2013 a mother who lost her looks and was given an asbo after a five - month raucous drinking binge at her house has admitted that alcohol has ruined her life			1
@entity9 , 28 , who blames her transformation from fresh - faced young woman into haggard neighbour from hell on heavy drinking after her father died from a heart attack , says it has cost more than her looks			1
today the mother of one said she had lost her only son as well as her home in @entity22 , @entity23 , as a result of her two - bottles - a - night bingeing , and vowed to change her life for the better			1
@entity27 , a former factory worker who is now sleeping on friends ' sofas , said : ' i 've lost everything and it 's down to my drinking			2
' contrast : @entity9 went from a fresh - faced young mother , left , to a haggard drunk , right , in just five months after embarking on a non-stop binge @entity36 : the 28 - year - old held raucous parties at her home which lasted up to five days , according to neighbours she said she had sought help to tackle her drinking problem and told the @entity42 : ' i want to get my son back and get myself a part - time job			1
that is what hurts me the most because i love him so much			0
' drinks company @entity51 , manufacturers of @entity27 's favourite perry , said : ' there appear to be many issues and factors contributing to ms @entity9 's case			1
we always recommend that alcohol is consumed responsibly within the daily unit guidelines			0
the firm said @entity51 was not solely responsible for @entity27 's problems , saying that she consumed a wide range of alcoholic drinks , of which @entity51 was just one			0
@entity27 , who was given an antisocial behaviour order ( @entity65 ) last month and barred from her regular haunts including shopping centres , was evicted from her terraced house after neighbours complained that she held all - night parties			1
but today she insisted she had n't been partying but simply watching soap operas and drinking with her boyfriend and another friend			2
she also said the police mugshot which showed the shocking toll alcohol had taken on her previously youthful looks had actually been taken a year earlier when she was the victim of domestic violence			1
if @entity27 , a mother of one , returns to her old house and causes further distress to neighbours she could be jailed for up to five years			2
before : @entity27 , a mother of one son , looks happy and pretty in pictures taken by friends earlier this year after : she became addicted to drinking @entity51 and other types of alcohol during her binge sessions @entity95 @entity94 in @entity22 imposed the order after hearing that she was ' repeatedly responsible for causing noise nuisance and displaying drunk and disorderly behaviour '			1
@entity27 's former neighbours welcomed the decision to evict her from the area , describing how she would keep them awake with parties which went on for up to five days at a time			2
one said : ' it 's an absolute total relief to the neighbourhood that she 's gone , and it 's fair to say we 've had our first peaceful night 's sleep in ages			0
' @entity9 was nothing but a drunk and a terrible drunk at that			1
she may look as though butter would not melt in some of her pictures but the reality was she was nothing but trouble			0
' she would have three or four blokes around every weekend and they would be sat there drinking for @entity124 and taking drugs			2
' when she first moved in she was alright and i tried to help her			0
i even mended her child 's bike and helped her out with odd jobs			0
but then she lost it and her true colours shone through ever since			0
kicked out : @entity27 has been forced to leave her terraced house in @entity22 after being handed an @entity65 ' sadly it was the drink which took over her life and she 's been a constant source of problems round her			1
it was parties every weekend and we could n't sleep			2
it would just be noise from them shouting more than noise from music			0
' sometimes it was just a couple of them , and sometimes it was four or five people and they would be out here in front of our house and in the street drinking and taking drugs			2
' sometimes she would be downstairs with people having a party when her child was upstairs			0
it was nightmare living next door to her			0
' the 52 - year - old woman , who gave evidence at @entity27 's @entity65 hearing , added : ' sometimes parties would go on from thursday until monday			1
they would sleep in the day when we 're at work and in the night be all shouting and drinking			0
' i believe she is seeking treatment for her alcohol abuse and she says she has managed to curb her drinking - but only from two bottles of @entity51 a day to one and a half			1
' @entity179 from @entity180 said after the case : ' this asbo is an excellent result for local residents who were being kept up until all hours because of noise and excessive drinking by @entity9			1
' they had really had enough and i hope that this result will enable them to sleep without disruption			0
' i hope this sends out a clear message that police and other agencies will not tolerate this type of behaviour and will take firm action against those involved in anti-social behaviour			0
