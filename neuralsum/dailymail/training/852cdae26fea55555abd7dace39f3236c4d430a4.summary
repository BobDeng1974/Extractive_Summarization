by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor veteran labour mp @entity2 was elected mp for @entity3 in 1977 but will step down at the next election the growing number of female mps in the @entity7 is making it too ‘ gentle ’ to wield power after the next election , a veteran mp has said			1
@entity2 , the @entity7 mp for @entity3 , said he was worried about the falling number of experienced men in the party because the party will be full of ‘ amenable and leadable ’ women obsessed with feminism			1
mr @entity2 , 79 , who is stepping down at the next election , said @entity7 was becoming more ‘ family - friendly , gentler ’ but ‘ less prepared for all - night shenanigans of the parliamentary kind ’			1
he also hit out at @entity7 ’s so - called ‘ red princes ’ – who he dismissively referred to as ‘ the scions of our great dynasties , the @entity23 , the @entity24 , the @entity25 , the @entity26 ’			2
he said they were the only ones allowed to bypass all - women shortlists			0
@entity7 introduced all women shortlists in 1993 and has since seen a surge in the number of female @entity32 - 81 out of 257			2
the veteran mp said the party ’s new ‘ preoccupations ’ will be ‘ social , educational and family issues ’ which have all been ‘ brought to the fore by the feminisation of @entity7 through the obsession with @entity40 ’ , mr @entity2 said all - women shortlists were being imposed on regions such as @entity43 and the @entity44 as a form of punishment ‘ for their earlier male chauvinism ’			1
he said : ‘ it can not be denied that feminisation and youthification will make @entity52 brighter , smarter and nicer			1
‘ yet the @entity53 will also be more preoccupied with the local rather than the international ( not necessarily a bad thing ) and small problems rather than big ideas and issues ( a very bad thing as it will be less exciting and lead to sixth - form essays read out word for cut - and - pasted word , replacing oratory )			0
‘ @entity63 will be even smaller but the party more manageable and reasonable , for apart from obsessive feminism , women @entity65 are more amenable and leadable and less objectionable			0
but it might not make us tougher			0
‘ if @entity7 wins in 2015 , how a family - friendly , gentler party , less prepared for all - night shenanigans of the parliamentary kind , will face up to @entity75 hooligans who feel they ’ve been unjustly deprived of a power that ’s their due , is a more worrying matter			1
’ almost half of @entity7 's cabinet are women and @entity81 is understood to want to hit 50 per cent by the next election - up from 44 per cent today			2
@entity7 's leading women , pictured here , from left back row : @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91			0
front row : @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 mr @entity2 said the parliamentary party was undergoing ‘ the biggest process of feminisation and rejuvenation embarked on since fabulous pink @entity104 soap promised to make us look a little lovelier each day ’			2
but he added : ‘ whatever the state of @entity7 ’s policies for the next election , there is little doubt that it will be fought by a younger , more attractive body of candidates			0
the 79 - year - old also said ageism was ‘ rampant ’ in @entity52			1
he said the @entity115 was being used as a ‘ marvellous political retirement home ’			0
but he said : ‘ neither the @entity117 [ @entity117 ] nor the commons are good places for oldies with any ambition			0

@entity2 says number of female mps in the @entity7 is making it too ' gentle '
@entity2 said the party ’s new ' preoccupations ' will be ' family issues '
says feminisation will make @entity52 ' brighter , smarter and nicer '
the 79 - year - old @entity3 mp also said ageism was ' rampant ' in @entity52
