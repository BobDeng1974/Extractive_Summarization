it may be a la mode to create lighter versions of our favourite snacks but one company has taken the trend rather literally			0
the world 's first glow in the dark ice cream was handed out to a cinema audience who were surprised to find their snacks glowed a fluorescent yellow when the lights went out			1
the film fanatics were treated to the inventive ice cream at the @entity17 in @entity18 ahead of a screening of @entity21 's film @entity22			1
the sci - fi style snack appears to be nothing more than a normal mint cornetto however once under uv lighting the sweet treat lights up in luminous colours			2
according to @entity39 's this is a world first and means that cinema goers can avoid a sticky spillages as they are able to see what they 're eating even in the dark			0
out of this world : the ice cream was developed by @entity30 and @entity31 for @entity28 @entity39 's wanted to develop a frozen treat that customers would be able to see even in the dark in order to create the gleaming gelato the ice cream is mixed with riboflavin which gives out a glow when under certain uv lights			1
despite the fact that mobile phones are banned in cinema theatres as the light they give out provides a distraction , @entity30 and @entity31 insist that the ice creams wo n't create the same problem			0
' the team at @entity64 wanted to make a cinema - based snack that you can eat and still see in the cinema without disrupting the film so we worked on it , and have come up with this ice cream , which is something we have been experimenting with for a long time			2
' the ice cream is created by mixing it with riboflavin which immits a glow when under certain uv lights @entity77 and @entity31 say that despite their bright glow the ice creams should n't distract from the film the team at @entity30 have since been developing further glow in the dark desserts using luciferin enzymes from genetically modified bacteria			1
' this is something quite special , ' @entity77 told @entity88 magazine ' using the same enzyme that fireflies and jellyfish use to fluoresce - that we use to make a fancy sauce for the dessert			0
' although a fluorescent pudd may seem anything other than natural the team insist that it is a completely wholesome process ... sort of , saying : ' it 's totally organic and natural , if you 're okay with genetically modified organisms			0
