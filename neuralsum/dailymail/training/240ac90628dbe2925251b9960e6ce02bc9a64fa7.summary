by @entity0 published : 11:35 est , 12 july 2013 updated : 05:28 est , 13 july 2013 @entity1 is bracing itself for one of its most disappointing months in recent memory after a series of big budget productions have bombed at the box office			0
this summer has seen fierce competition at cinemas with over 20 films boasting budgets of $ 100 million ( £ 66million ) or more fighting to fill the seats			0
@entity13 of the flops appears to be @entity16 's $ 225 million ' @entity15 ' which despite starring roles for @entity18 and @entity19 , only brought in $ 29 million on it 's opening july 4 weekend			1
and there are serious concerns over @entity27 's $ 180 million sci - fi monster romp ' @entity28 ' which is expected to open at around $ 30 million this weekend			2
' @entity32 ' , the @entity30 and @entity31 thriler about a team of undead police officers is projected to pull in less than $ 15 million , despite a hefty $ 130 million production budget			0
@entity22 had a disappointing opening weekend and @entity32 is not projected to open with a boom there are concerns for @entity27 's $ 180 million sci - fi monster romp ' @entity28 ' which is expected to open at around $ 30 million and even the normally reliable @entity41 production house could be left with a stinker as ' @entity43 ' , a $ 135 million family film about a snail with dreams of speed , is also expected to do badly when it opens on the same weekend			1
it 's a far cry from july 2012 when the last in the @entity50 ' @entity51 ' puled in $ 168 million			2
@entity15 ( $ 225m ) $ 29m @entity22 ( $ 150m ) $ 25m @entity28 ( $ 180m ) $ 30m ( projected ) @entity32 ( $ 130m ) $ 15m ( projected ) ' turbo ' , ( $ 135m ) $ 30m ( projected ) but according to the report on thewrap.com there are some encouraging signs on the horizon			1
@entity23 ’s $ 80 million ' @entity56 starring @entity57 is expected to bring in between $ 40 million and $ 45 million and @entity60 's @entity59 spin - off ' wolverine ' , starring @entity61 is projected to draw a healthy $ 70 million when it opens on july 26			1
@entity63 will be hoping the dreadful @entity64 wil prove to be mearly a blip between record - breaking grosses in may and june from the likes of ' @entity68 ' and ' @entity69 '			0
august will begin with opening weekends for @entity71 and @entity73 's ' two guns ' , ' @entity75 ' , ' @entity74 , starring @entity76 and @entity77 , ' @entity78 , ' ' @entity79 : @entity80 ' and ' planes ' .			0

@entity18 's $ 225 million ' @entity15 ' pulls in just $ 29 million on opening
it follows disastrous opening for @entity23 ’s $ 150 million ' @entity22 '
august is looking encouraging with a raft of *potential* *blockbusters* to come
