by @entity0 we are in the car , en route to the airport for our summer holiday , when a piercing shriek from the back causes my husband @entity8 to slam on the brakes and pull over to the side of the road			1
turning round to deal with whatever emergency awaits , we are faced with the stricken faces of our two teenage daughters			1
' we forgot the hair straighteners , ' they wail			1
' you 'll have to go back			1
' returning home is n’t an option , but once through airport security , @entity21 and @entity22 rush off in a panic to search for the requisite irons in the shops - apparently , only @entity27 ( @entity27 ) ones will do			1
double - take : @entity31 's girls @entity22 , left , and @entity21 dress like many other teens when they fail , the pair board the plane as if they ’ve just been sentenced to ten years ' hard labour - not heading for fun in the @entity38 sunshine			1
while many mothers will join me in raising an eyebrow in amused exasperation , i ca n't help thinking my daughters ' behaviour reflects something far more disturbing about teenage girls - that they have become a generation of vapid clones for whom a preoccupation with looks and appearance takes precedence over everything else			1
from what i have observed of my oldest daughters - @entity21 is nearly 15 , @entity22 , almost 13 - it comes as absolutely no surprise that new research reveals teenage girls are under almost unbearable stress to aspire to a glossy , ideal image of beauty			1
mirror images : @entity65 's daughters aspire to look like their celeb heroines with straight blonde hair and skimpy clothes @entity69 : they look up to @entity72 stars such as @entity73 and @entity74 and tv presenter @entity75 , right this rarely exists outside the photo - shopped pages of celebrity magazines and the artificial world of scripted reality shows such as @entity72 and made in @entity82			1
this has been backed up by the views of several experts , including @entity87 lecturer and film - maker @entity88 , who , for decades , has been documenting how mass culture represents women			1
' in the past 40 years , culture has stepped beyond setting an ideal image of beauty for women to aspire to ; now it sets an impossible image , ' she says			1
' the girls consider it a crime worse than death to leave the house without mascara			2
neither will countenance wearing a skirt longer than the middle of their thighs ' as a result , a generation of copycats is emerging , all with long , straightened hair ( preferably blonde ) , stick thin figures , caramel tans and the heavy make - up that their role models are never seen without			1
when @entity21 and @entity22 wander along our local @entity117 on a saturday afternoon , it is impossible to spot them among the sea of identikit teens			1
for they and all their peers are equally desperate to ape this unachievable celebrity ideal			2
they gather in hordes , wearing identical @entity128 outfits , hairstyles and shoes			2
disturbingly , they are all so in synch it is not dissimilar to witnessing a @entity134 army on parade			2
this stepford - style mentality causes me constant angst			2
have i failed my teenage daughters by allowing them to become so shallow and vain ? they even talk the same and use all the same expressions			2
last term , @entity21 started at boarding school			1
i was expecting a rocky first few days - teary phone calls and homesickness - but i heard nothing for a fortnight			2
loss of individuality : @entity31 wishes her daughters could be more unique like they were when they were younger then , finally , my mobile rang			1
' at last , ' i thought , silently pleased			2
' she 's finally missing me			2
' but rather than the emotional conversation i was hoping for , what i got was this : ' mum , my waterproof mascara has run out and so has my bb cream			2
could you organise an overnight courier ? ' so , where , i wonder , has their originality and uniqueness gone ? @entity22 is not yet even an ' official ' teenager , yet her make - up bag is overflowing with more products than i possess			1
@entity21 and @entity22 have a uniform of outfits - tight black leggings , teeny shorts and cropped tops - that they swap between themselves , but otherwise refuse to deviate from			1
' it seems as if the shallow celebrity culture we live in is somehow sucking the very soul out of my lovely girls and turning them into something vacuous ' they have been blessed with beautiful long blonde hair , which , even though they do n't have a curl in sight , they still spend an hour each morning straightening as flat as a ruler			1
the girls consider it a crime worse than death to leave the house without mascara			2
neither will countenance wearing a skirt longer than the middle of their thighs			2
as sisters , they do , of course , look similar			2
you might think that because of this , they would want to inject some individuality into their appearance			2
but on the contrary , they are utterly determined to look like carbon copies of each other - and every other teenager within a five - mile radius			0
you might argue that teenagers have always been the same - materialistic and obsessed with themselves			0
yet as i look at my two girls , staring at their images in every mirror they pass , i ca n't help thinking they are a world away from my @entity216 ' self			0
back in 1985 , at the age of 14 , i remember being hell - bent on standing out from the crowd			0
for me , being a teenager was all about experimenting , revelling in my emerging personality and expressing myself to the world			0
narrow - minded : @entity21 and @entity22 have set ideas on their appearances and do n't like to deviate from what is ' cool ' i remember perming my hair , dying it ink black and using henna to turn it red , all in the same year			1
but it was n't just about my generation 's different attitude towards looks			0
the @entity216 were a fun - filled decade			0
despite being at a strict all - girls ' convent school , i felt that i could goof around and be myself			0
it did n’t matter that i wore braces , had no boobs to speak of and mousy hair			1
no two of my friends looked the same and , anyway , we would n’t have wanted to			0
our idols were @entity243 , @entity244 and @entity246 - three women who could n’t be more different			0
we were n't bombarded with the same homogenous images that my daughters are			0
there were no rules on what to look like and no one to sneer at us if we got it wrong			0
sadly , all that is in stark contrast to the modern world			0
' short of plonking them on a desert island away from the superficial rubbish they are bombarded with , i am at a loss over what to do ' @entity263 , an academic at @entity264 , who studies the grooming habits of women aged 18 to 25 , says girls report a great hostility to anyone who does n't look the same			0
' the spectrum of what is acceptable is very small , ' she says			0
' it is not , for example , enough that girls must all have straight hair			1
they must use @entity27 straighteners			0
' @entity21 and @entity22 will go even further			1
they can be ruthlessly critical of each other			0
i have watched @entity22 put together an outfit , having carefully studied her older sister , only for @entity21 to cast a single damning glance because the skirt she is wearing is a millimetre too long or it 's ' not cool ' with her shoes			1
then @entity21 will put on almost identical clothes and deem them acceptable because they have been bought from @entity128 not @entity286 , or some z - list celebrity she is following on @entity288 wore something similar a week ago			1
i watch these blossoming girls on the brink of womanhood and i ca n't help despairing			0
it ’s not just the fact that everything they want to wear is so tight , so revealing , dare i say it , slutty			1
it 's that they appear to have lost something of the wonderful uniqueness they once had			0
can it really be so long ago that @entity21 would dance down a pavement , oblivious to everyone around her ? or that @entity22 would walk to the local shop wearing a onesie and a silly hat just to see what people 's reactions would be ? i can remember feeling so proud of my girls and their robust sense of self			1
they have strong personalities and , up until recently , seemed to have refreshingly clear ideas of what they liked and did n't			0
now they are infuriatingly narrow - minded			0
if @entity322 thinks it 's ok , then it 's ok			0
if @entity324 has worn it ( or similar ) , then fine			0
of course , teenagers all succumb to peer pressure during the turbulent crossing from child to adult			0
it seems as if the shallow celebrity culture we live in is somehow sucking the very soul out of my lovely girls and turning them into something vacuous			0
i have no idea how to stop the rot from setting in			0
short of plonking them on a desert island away from the superficial rubbish they are bombarded with , i am at a loss over what to do			0
i simply have to cross my fingers and hope it ’s a passing phase that will see them emerging from their bedrooms looking like the two individuals i know they are			0
in the meantime , along with every other mother of a teenage girl , i can only pray that someone on @entity72 deems it cool to cut their hair , cover up and lose the mascara .			1

@entity21 , nearly 15 , and @entity22 , almost 13 , are identikit teens
they aspire to beauty seen in magazines and reality tv shows
this means having straight , blonde hair , a thin figure and tight clothes
@entity31 wishes they could be more unique
