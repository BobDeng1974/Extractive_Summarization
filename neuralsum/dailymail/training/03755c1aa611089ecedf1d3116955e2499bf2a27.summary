@entity26 ( far left ) was one of just two @entity32 soldiers recovered and buried before the plane sank into the murky water sgt @entity34 and flt sgt @entity35 are both still trapped in the wreckage in the tiny village of @entity38 now , the team of @entity32 archaeologists have been granted permission to recover the wreckage and bodies , prompting the brothers , sisters , and children of the @entity4 airmen to demand a proper burial for their loved ones from the government			1
the men were deployed for a night raid over @entity53 on august 23 , but never returned home			1
enemy soldiers pulled two bodies from the wreckage before the plane sank from view into a marsh near @entity38 , 35 miles north of the capital			1
while @entity64 air gunners flt sgt @entity28 , 27 , and sgt @entity26 , age unknown , were recovered and buried in the @entity10 1939 - 45 war cemetery , the others were deemed ' missing '			2
but this year , @entity32 aviation archaeologists announced a shock discovery as the marsh , which is now drying up , has pushed the wreckage back to the surface			1
aviation archaeologists have scoured the area for years but only as the marsh dried up have found the plane the @entity32 research team has now been granted permission to recover the wreckage and the bodies this map indicates the site ( circled ) is 300 metres west of @entity79 and just south of @entity38 delighted family members are desperate to see their loved ones finally honoured and buried			1
@entity82 , 93 , the sister of trapped navigator sgt @entity34 , said : ' it would be a nice thing for them to finally be laid to rest in a proper burial			2
' i think the government should do something - they went down protecting the country and doing their duty			2
' @entity34 really loved flying and the crew were great friends			2
' mrs @entity96 , from @entity97 , @entity98 , added : ' we just were n't told anything at the time - it was quite extraordinary			0
' one letter came and said the plane went down and roughly where it happened			0
that is all we ever heard			0
sgt @entity106 ( far left ) is one of the trapped servicemen that families would like to give a proper burial			0
@entity64 airmen sgt @entity26 ( centre ) and @entity113 lie in the @entity115 cemetery the family of flt sgt @entity27 was one of the five told their relative was ' missing ' after the @entity119 crashed ' i do n't know what happened to the letter - i expect my mother did away with it			0
' we never had any more details about what had happened to them after that			0
' the team of @entity32 archaeologists , who discovered the bomber crash site in 2002 , have been given permission by the @entity32 authorities to recover the wreckage			1
the families of the airmen are calling on the @entity139 government to help fund the £ 50,000 project			1
@entity141 , whose aunt was fiancée to air gunner flt sgt @entity28 , has worked with @entity32 archaeologists to rediscover the bomber crash site			1
he said : ' these airmen died a long way from home			0
they left to fight for a better world and died for it			0
action : the recovery project set to be undertaken by these archaeologists will cost £ 50,000 the team discovered the site in 2002 but have spent years rallying for permission to extract the craft a @entity158 spokesman said it is not custom to fund recovery projects but if bodies are found , measures will be taken to ensure they are buried properly			1
the plane will most likely be donated to a museum ' we owe them a debt we can never repay but it is important to give them a decent burial and for them to be with their fellow crew members			0
' a team has now been put together to recover the remains of the remaining trapped crewmen			0
' all we are waiting for is a decision from the @entity139 and @entity32 governments as to which one is responsible for the operation			2
' a spokesman for the @entity158 said : ' the @entity158 does not fund archaeological digs of historic aircraft			0
' however , if human remains are found , in co-operation with the @entity185 , the @entity158 will inform families , fund a burial in the local area where the remains are found , and support close family members attending a funeral service , if appropriate with a level of official ceremonial support			0
' @entity139 aircraft belong to @entity195 , however on conclusion of the formalities , we normally gift the remains of the aircraft if a local museum is willing to take them			0
