@entity8 was sentenced to a whole - life tariff after stabbing a bride ’s parents and brother to death on her wedding night and raping a teenage guest			1
but the 73 - year - old has become the first @entity17 to launch a bid for freedom after @entity21 judges last month decided that ‘ life - means - life ’ sentences are unlawful			2
challenge : @entity25 killer and rapist @entity8 , now 73 , is demanding the right to seek parole yesterday the decision was attacked by the family of @entity31 and @entity32 and their son @entity33 , who were murdered by @entity8 in 1983			1
they said in a statement : ‘ whenever even the name @entity8 rears its ugly head , it does nothing but create fear and distress to the victims of this heinous crime			2
' let the human rights judiciary members be thrust into our position for just a day and maybe they would understand this			0
‘ we are confident that justice will be done and more importantly , be seen to be done , so that this matter can finally be put to rest			0
