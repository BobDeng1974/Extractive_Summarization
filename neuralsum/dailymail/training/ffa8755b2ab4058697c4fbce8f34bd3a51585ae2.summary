@entity0 today urged @entity2 activists to ignore the doubters and take the fight to @entity5 and @entity6 with eight months until the election			1
in a barn - storming , joke - laden speech , the @entity9 mayor wielded a brick to promote housebuilding , mocked @entity15 's embarrassment for claiming the @entity16 ' purred ' and ridiculed @entity18 's ' conveyor belt tongue '			1
but he saved his most bombastic and outspoken attack for @entity5 , vowing to ' eat the kippers for breakfast ' , just hours after his former deputy mayor @entity22 announced he was defecting to @entity24 's party			1
but mr @entity0 vowed to ' eat the ' @entity38 for breakfast ' as he sought to unite @entity40 behind the battle with @entity6			2
in a move timed to embarrass the @entity9 mayor , ex-right - hand man @entity22 announced that he was joining @entity5 just hours before mr @entity0 's speech to the party conference in @entity31			1
mr @entity22 , who served as deputy mayor between 2008 and 2012 , accused mainstream parties of failing to ' speak the language of normal people '			1
but mr @entity0 hit back at ' quitters and splitters ' and told activists that victory in next year 's general election was ' within our grasp ' as long as the party remained united			1
mr @entity0 mocked @entity5 supporters , @entity18 and @entity58 throughout his speech to a packed hall it is the last time mr @entity0 will address the @entity2 conference before the general election , when he hopes to return to the @entity64 as an mp the brick mr @entity0 had with him came from @entity67 in @entity68 - under - @entity69 which he visited yesterday on @entity18 forgetting to mention the deficit ‘ the baggage handlers of his memory refused to load the word deficit on to the conveyor belt of his tongue			1
’ @entity76 ‘ bus crime is down by 40 per cent			2
which is absolutely not crime committed by buses , which is very rare indeed now			2
not crime committed on buses			2
’ @entity81 @entity80 's no vote ‘ @entity9 is not just the capital of @entity84 , but thanks to the wisdom of a majority of @entity88 , it is the capital of @entity90 and the capital of the @entity90 … you have permission to purr if you so choose			1
’ on new homes ‘ i want those homes to be marketed first and sold to people from this country and not sold to oligarchs from the planet @entity101			2
most of my ancestors come from @entity101			2
’ opening his speech , he asked the packed audience in the @entity107 of the @entity108 : ' whoa there			1
just before i begin can i check that we are all proud conservatives ? ' proud of the oldest and most successful party in all the @entity114 democracies ? do we intend to fight the next election under the @entity2 banner and no others ? ' are there any quitters or splitters ? anyone feeling a bit yellow around the edges - like a kipper ? ' if i can quote a great @entity126 author , ' he said in a direct message to other waverers culled from @entity130 's @entity129 : ' he which hath no stomach to this fight , let him depart			1
' because i genuinely think that this is a fantastic time to be a @entity2 and that just in the last few months we have seen @entity136 of the tapioca - like consensus that @entity18 could somehow osmotically infiltrate or inveigle himself into power by pandering to his core vote and relying on the gross unfairness of the electoral system			1
' the light is dawning , scales falling			2
across the country the chattering classes are waking up to the reality that victory is within our grasp in the next eight months			2
' only the @entity40 could deliver reform to the @entity90 's relationship with the @entity154 and an in / out referendum on membership , he said			2
and he mocked @entity18 for failing to mention the deficit in his @entity6 conference speech			1
‘ my friends , it can only be called a @entity162 slip			0
his subconscious rebelled , ' said @entity0			0
‘ the baggage handlers in his memory went on strike – as they would under a @entity6 government – and refused to load the word deficit on to the conveyor belt of his tongue			1
‘ because on this central question of politics he knows that it is we conservatives who are taking this country forward			0
‘ and @entity6 would take us back to the @entity179 regime that gave us the worst recession for 100 years			0
’ = comparing the successful fight against @entity88 independence with the imminent by - election battles to retain the seats given up by defecting mps @entity35 and @entity37 , he said : ' that 's our new fisheries policy , folks			1
' first chuck @entity191 overboard and then eat the ' @entity38 for breakfast			0
' we will fight them on the beaches of @entity194 and of @entity195 and @entity196 as well			1
' he went on : ' there ’s only leader in @entity200 which can deliver reform			0
one man who has the experience and respect in @entity200 to make the case and then take that case to the people of the country in an in - out referendum			0
' that man is not @entity191 or @entity58 or @entity18			1
’ mr @entity0 urged @entity40 to ignore the doubters and make the case for a majority government in 2015 sitting in the audience for @entity0 's speech today , @entity15 appeared to be mobbed by @entity40 wanting a selfie activists appeared from all directions wanting a photograph with the prime minister in the @entity107 @entity223 ( left ) was among those wanting to get snap on their phone with the @entity2 leader mr @entity15 was all smiles as he prepared to listen to the @entity9 mayor 's barnstorming speech @entity232 arrived in @entity31 tonight , ahead of husband @entity233 's speech to the @entity2 conference he issued a direct plea to conservatives to be more outspoken in their defence of the party 's work and achievements			1
' for 200 years our party has been a party which believes in social justice			0
we believe that the best answer to inequality is opportunity			0
‘ we believe in encouraging success not punishing			0
we believe in wealth creation not levelling down			0
' that ’s why all our polices are aimed at getting people into work			0
' he went on : ' let us unite now , let ’s get together			0
get the whole @entity2 family together			0
take the fight to the unrepentant , unreconstructed @entity259 and @entity260			2
lets be proud of our part and what we have done			0
‘ and when people doubt us and doubt our good intentions , explain again and again our fundamental @entity2 instincts that we live by			0
‘ let ’s leave @entity268 to his football practice , let ’s leave @entity18 to mast the art of the bacon sandwich			1
‘ let ’s leave the @entity274 , @entity58 , to get on with whatever it is that he does			0
‘ let us , let us the @entity2 , get on with our work of the harnessing talents of the people of this country			0
see you at the barricades ! ’ his jokey speech was well - received by @entity40 in the conference hall , including @entity15			1
but it stood in stark contrast to the heavyweight speech delivered immediately beforehand by home secretary @entity289 , who is widely seen as a future rival for the party leadership			2
@entity292 , veteran political commentator at the @entity293 , said the contrast was ‘ like bringing on @entity294 after the prophet @entity295 ’			0
the @entity2 have produced a range of memorabilia for their conference in @entity31 ( top ) , including mugs and travelcard holders carrying conservative slogans ( middle row ) and crisps beer mats and lager bottles mocking the @entity6 the brick mr @entity0 had with him came from @entity67 in @entity68 - under - @entity69 which he visited yesterday			1
he said the company was ‘ hiring people and firing bricks ’ to help ‘ build the homes that people need , and to help them on to the property ladder ’			0
with 400,000 new homes needed in @entity9 , huge resources and building materials will be required , he said			1
‘ we will need 1billion ... this brick will not be alone when it comes to @entity9			1
‘ i want those homes to be marketed first and sold to people from this country and not sold to oligarchs from the planet @entity101			0
most of my ancestors come from @entity101			0

@entity9 mayor addresses packed @entity107 in @entity31
he promises to fight @entity5 ' on the beaches ' of @entity194 and @entity195
gives @entity15 ' permission to purr ' after gaffe over @entity16 and @entity88
ridicules @entity18 for failing to mention ' deficit ' in his speech last week
