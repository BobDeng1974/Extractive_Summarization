by @entity0 a former cop - turned - disability schemer has been revealed to have been renting a $ 1.5million @entity3 mansion using the money he was given from @entity6			1
@entity7 , 48 , was held up by the @entity9 district attorney as one of the poster boys for the widespread scam when it was announced on tuesday and now details of how he spent the $ 175,000 he pocketed have been revealed			1
the former @entity9 police officer and his wife moved from @entity9 to the warmer climes of @entity18 , @entity3 and are currently renting a waterfront mansion that has a pool and access to a waterway where he parks his two jet skis			1
@entity7 was seen turning himself in to @entity26 authorities today at around 8.3am after being allowed to drive himself up to @entity9 , and could spend up to 15 years behind bars for his part in the scheme			1
scroll down for @entity30 sending a message : @entity7 is pictured on a jet ski , clearly not as incapacitated as he claimed to be in his benefit filing life of luxury : @entity7 's @entity18 home had an on - site pool and access to water where he docked his two jet skis the @entity8 introduced the public to @entity7 by showing a picture of the father - of - two on a jet ski sticking up both of his middle fingers while smiling at the camera			1
aside from painting an unflattering portrait of @entity7 , it also directly contradicts his claims that he suffered from ' depression and panic attacks ' after working at @entity53 following the terrorist attacks			1
a former colleague told the @entity56 that his illnesses were n't the only false part of his story - as they said he never even worked at the site			0
there were 102 people who were indicted as recipients in the fraudulent benefits scheme , and @entity7 is one of 82 of those people who used to work as a cop , fire fighter or corrections officer			1
some of the accused had been falsely claiming disability funds since the 1980s - with the help of four administrative ringleaders - while others only started after the september 11 terrorist attacks			0
many were coached about how they could appear depressed or in the throes of @entity77			0
it is not known what exactly @entity7 claimed to have , but he started collecting payments in 2009 and has since brought in a total of $ 175,000			1
' when he told me he was a retired police officer and i saw how he was living , i told my husband that something did nâ€™t add up , ' neighbor @entity85 told the @entity86			2
ms @entity85 said that she has not seen his jeep in the @entity7 's driveway but his wife @entity89 's car and their dog , @entity93 , are still in @entity18			1
not so afraid of crowds now : @entity95 , who said his post- 9/11 fear of crowds kept him from working , collected $ 108,930 in payments and is seen here selling cannolis at the packed @entity101 festival busted : @entity102 ( left ) collected $ 232,443 from the fund but also broke the rules by working as a helicopter pilot and @entity106 ( right ) worked as a martial arts instructor while collecting $ 470,395 from @entity6 active : @entity109 collected a total of $ 207639 since may 2008 @entity7 did work on the force for 19 years as part of the @entity114 officer , and it is not clear if he had picked up a secondary job since moving to @entity3			1
if he did , that would disqualify him from receiving disability payments			0
that is how a number of the other fraudsters were caught , and the @entity8 told how some were working as helicopter pilots and martial arts instructors - activities that blatantly went against their disability claims			2
the officers were not the only ones in on the scheme , as @entity130 reports that some of the accused ' siblings pulled the same move			1
@entity134 is one of the 102 indicted fraudsters , and his siblings @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139 all told officials that they had psychiatric ailments that made it impossible for them to hold down a job			2
all told , the @entity145 siblings collected $ 596,000 - with the largest portion - $ 287,000 - going to @entity139 as he began making disability claims in 2002			1
@entity134 , 43 , collected $ 148,000 and the remaining $ 161,000 was split between @entity138 , @entity147 and @entity137			0
many of the fraudsters left a virtual trail , including @entity134 who posted a motivational video online ( which has now been removed ) where he talked about ways to get rich quick			0
another such example was that of @entity95 , who told authorities that his work after the september 11th attacks left him with a debilitating fear of crowds			0
not hurting too badly : @entity160 , 58 , lives in @entity161 , @entity9 and his alleged disabilities - which have not been specifically disclosed - should have prevented him from motorcycling but he proudly posted this to @entity164 throwback : @entity160 had no qualms about posting this old picture of him in uniform online , and he was far from the only ' boy in blue ' that was involved in the scheme on @entity164 , he was pictured selling cannolis at the crowded @entity173 in @entity174			1
the suspicion is that there were a handful of ' crooked ' lawyers and doctors who worked with the responders in question and were fully aware of how to ' game the system '			0
the four alleged ' ringleaders ' were identified first , and it is clear that their positions within the @entity187 and background in legal work helped them evade capture for years			2
participants would start out by contacting @entity192 , 61 , a @entity194 consultant , or @entity195 , 64 , a retired member of the @entity187			2
@entity196 or @entity197 would then refer the fraudsters to one of two lawyers who were in on the scheme - @entity201 , 89 , and former @entity204 agent @entity203 , 83			2
all four are charged with first and second degree grand larceny			0
the 9/11 disability claims are not the first that the four men have had a hand in , as @entity211 reports that they are believed to have been running disability scams since 1988			1
the lawyers put the schemers in touch with two different doctors - but not after some coaching			0
the district attorney laid out a series of different trigger phrases that would help justify an anxiety condition prescription			0
tag team : @entity196 ( left ) , a @entity194 consultant , or @entity195 ( right ) , a retired member of the @entity187 , would refer the fraudsters to one of two lawyers who were in on the scheme law on their side : @entity203 , 83 , was one of those two lawyers who then helped process the legal papers which allowed the schemers to get on average between $ 30,000 and $ 50,000 per year - with a nice cut for each of the ringleaders they range from ' i nap on and off during the day ' to ' my ( family member ) is always after me about my grooming '			1
other possible additions included the lamentation that they were ' healthy , active , productive ' people but no longer			0
' they 're liable to say ... spell the word " world , " so you go " @entity247 - @entity246 " then they 're gon na say " spell it backwards			0
" you think about it , and you ca n't spell it backwards , " ' court papers report that @entity197 said in a recording			0
all told , the fraudulent claims cost $ 24.5million in taxpayer - funded benefits			2
' for years , federal taxpayers have unwittingly financed the lifestyles of the defendants charged today , ' district attorney @entity255 said in a statement which listed all of the 106 accused			0
' many participants cynically manufactured claims of mental illness as a result of september 11th , dishonoring the first responders who did serve their @entity266 at the expense of their own health and safety			0
this alleged scam further depleted the already limited resources available for battling the real and complex conditions of ptsd and depression			2

@entity7 , 48 , took home $ 175,000 since 2009 and was living in @entity18 at his rented $ 1.5million home
@entity7 turned himself in to @entity9 authorities *thursday* *morning* after driving up from @entity3
retired @entity187 officers , *firefighters* and corrections officers claimed they had ptsd and depression because of the @entity53 clean up
received thousands in annual disability *compensation* from 9/11 disability fund as a result , promising that they retired
the whole scheme cost taxpayers $ *21.4million* *dollars*
some kept it ' in the family ' and had *multiple* siblings in on the plot
lawyers coached fraudsters on how they should talk about leaving the tv on all day and constantly napping , having trouble grooming themselves
