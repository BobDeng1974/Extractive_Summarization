a 4,000 - year - old @entity1 statue which was sold by a council for nearly £ 16million to an overseas buyer has been banned from leaving @entity4			1
the statue of @entity6 , a limestone figure which is just 30in high , was controversially sold by @entity8 for £ 15.76m last year to a mystery buyer abroad			1
but the council was accused of committing ‘ a great act of folly ’ by @entity11 , who feared the ancient relic could disappear into private ownership overseas			1
sold : the statue of @entity6 ( pictured at @entity18 , @entity19 last year ) , a limestone figure which is just 30in high , was controversially sold by @entity8 for £ 15.76million to a mystery buyer abroad now the culture minister @entity22 has ordered a four - month export ban on the relic leaving the @entity25 after @entity26 ruled the sale breached standards for how museums manage their collections			1
that ban could even be extended to march 2016 if a ‘ serious intention to raise funds to purchase the statue is made ’ , @entity26 said			2
the statue , which dates from @entity36 , is a tomb model of a kilt - wearing high official surrounded by his wife , son and seven offering bearings			2
mr @entity22 praised the figure as a work of ‘ outstanding aesthetic importance ’ , and ‘ the finest example of its kind anywhere in the world			0

above , the artifact picture in @entity18 's last year but in july last year the council sold off the piece , which they have owned for more than 100 years , insisting it was n’t the centrepiece of their collection			0
the @entity1 government called on the statue to be returned to @entity1 if @entity8 did not want it , and said the sale ran counter to the values and role of museums worldwide			1
a @entity8 council spokesman said the export ban had ‘ no impact ’ on the council ’s sale of the statue – and insisted it was a matter for the government and @entity26 to resolve between them			1
tomb model : the statue of @entity6 , on display at @entity18 , @entity19 , ahead of its sale last year the statue of @entity6 was found during a 19th century archaeological dig near @entity82			1
the tomb model shows a seated man wearing a kilt and wig , with his wife , son and offering - bearers			0
@entity6 was a high level scribe who lived in the @entity92 sometime between @entity93 and @entity94 - the period of @entity1 history when the pyramids of @entity98 were built			2
in a country that was mainly illiterate , his ability to read and write means he would have been a person of high status with access to high offices			0
at first , tomb statues - a sign of wealth - were reserved for the royal family			0
but as the economy improved , officials like @entity6 who held high - ranking positions could afford to pay craftsmen to create likenessess of themselves for their tomb			2
they served two purposes : to act as a record of the way the person looked , and to ensure that the offerings he desired for his survival in the afterlife - listed on the papyrus carried in the statue 's hands - were made after his death			0
it is unkown exactly when the statue arrived at @entity130 , but records indicate it was on display before the end of the 1890s			0
it has been on display at various @entity139 museums until two years ago			0
the statue , which stands just 30in high , has been praised as a work of ' outstanding aesthetic importance ' by culture minister @entity22			1
he added it was ' the finest example of any kind in the world '			0
