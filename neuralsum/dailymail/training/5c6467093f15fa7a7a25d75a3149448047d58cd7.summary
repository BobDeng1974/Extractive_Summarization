@entity1 head coach @entity0 is keeping his fingers crossed that the club can do the business he wants as he awaits the opening of the january transfer window			1
the 47 - year - old @entity7 has made no secret of the fact he is desperate to further strengthen his squad next month with goals a priority , but he knows too how difficult the winter market can be			1
sporting director @entity15 is the man charged with the task of fulfilling @entity0 's wishes , and the latter knows he will have to remain patient			1
@entity1 manager @entity0 is keen to bring in new players in the january transfer window @entity21 is sent off during @entity1 's 0 - 0 draw with @entity23 have drawn more games than any other team in the @entity26 this season ( 11 ) he said with a smile : ' yes , we want the best player in the world very cheap , nice - looking , he can score goals , he can run , sprint			1
' but it 's difficult , very difficult			2
we are working , i can tell you we are working very hard			2
are we going to bring in someone ? are we going to buy him , loan him ? we will see , it depends on so many things			2
' certain kinds of players are only available on loan ; certain kinds of players , you need to buy them and it costs a lot ; certain players , they cost less because they are a nightmare or they have got some issues and you think you are the genius who can bring them to you and calm them down			2
' if you see what happens in @entity56 and @entity58 - @entity57 goes one way and then @entity60 go maybe the other way , and that starts making things happen			2
' we are working very hard , very hard			0
it 's not easy , but we will see			0
' @entity1 need a goal scorer to supplement @entity66 and @entity67 ( right ) @entity1 's three strikers , including @entity69 ( right ) have only scored six goals between them @entity0 's main focus is not difficult to identify with his team having scored only 16 goals in their first 19 @entity26 games of the season , and the fact that forwards @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity69 have contributed just six between them is an added concern			1
but asked about the chances of boosting his strike force , he replied : ' the easiest way to sort out a few problems in front of goal is to go and buy			0
' now the right price , the right player who scores goals coming here and doing it straight away - everybody is looking for the same , so it 's a competition			1
there are not many , but we will try			0
' if he faces an anxious wait on the transfer front , @entity0 has at least received better news on injuries with three players due to return to training			1
@entity99 , who damaged an ankle in sunday 's 0 - 0 draw at @entity102 , is expected to train on wednesday and could yet be available for thursday 's trip to @entity104 , although fellow midfielder @entity105 will play no part at the @entity107			1
@entity0 said : ' @entity99 is going to train tomorrow			1
the injury is the kind of injury we can all react to differently			0
it 's going to be painful for a while because he twisted his ankle badly , but the damage to the ligament is not that big			0
@entity105 ( 3rd left ) has been ruled out for the game against @entity104 on @entity119 ' it looks bad because it 's swollen , so it depends how you cope with the pain			1
from what i have seen , @entity99 is quite confident that he is going to train tomorrow			0
he knows it 's going to hurt , but he is willing to go ahead , so he is looking good			0
' @entity105 , protocol , we are going to go with the rules			0
there are certain rules - he looks perfect today and is desperate to get out and desperate to play because he loves the chance to play			2
' but we have been talking a lot about these concussions and we are going to go with the rules , so until , i think it 's friday , he can not even train , so we are going to keep him safe			0
' meanwhile , full - backs @entity138 and @entity140 are expected to resume training next monday after recovering from a dislocated shoulder and a calf problem respectively with the @entity144 a week ahead of schedule .			0
