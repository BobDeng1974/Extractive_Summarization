sunbathing has been blamed for a massive surge in cancer rates over the past ten years			1
cancers caused by unhealthy lifestyles , such as drinking and smoking , have seen a rise of up to two - thirds in the last decade , official figures show			1
cases of malignant melanoma – the deadliest form of skin cancer , which affects many young people – rose more than any other type in the past decade			1
sunbathing has been blamed for a massive surge in cancer rates over the past ten years the surge is in part due to people ’s ‘ choice of clothing ’ and failure to cover up in the sun , leaving them exposed to harmful uv rays , according to the @entity27			1
lung cancer and other forms linked to smoking have also gone up , along with oral and kidney cancers , which can be triggered by alcohol			1
overall , two out of five cases of cancer are blamed on poor lifestyle , with about a quarter of breast cancers attributed to lifestyle and environmental factors			1
the @entity27 report shows the number of cases of malignant melanoma soared by 66 per cent between 2002 and 2011			1
cases of malignant melanoma rose more than any other type in the past decade in 2002 there were around 6,700 cases diagnosed in @entity45 , but by 2011 there were 11,100			2
nearly 85,000 non-melanoma skin cancers – also driven by sun exposure – were diagnosed in @entity45 in 2011			2
‘ these increases are considered to be due to altered patterns of behaviour in recent decades , such as a choice of clothing and recreational sunbathing , ’ says the @entity27			1
lung cancer and other forms linked to smoking have also gone up , along with oral and kidney cancers , which can be triggered by alcohol there were 7,000 cases of kidney cancer – which is linked to drinking – in 2011 , compared with 5,000 cases in 2002 , and about 6,000 oral cancers			1
the report found that 27 per cent of cases of breast cancer in women are linked to lifestyle and environmental factors – such as alcohol consumption , obesity , lack of physical activity , and hormonal and reproductive factors			0
in 2011 , 41,523 @entity45 women were diagnosed with the disease and it is the most common cancer in women accounting for 30 per cent of cases			0
prostate cancer was the most common type in men , with 35,567 cases in 2011 accounting for a quarter			0
the rate of lung cancer in women is fast catching up with men as older women who started smoking since the 1970s develop the disease			2
the number of men diagnosed was 19,173 in 2011 – a fall of 11 per cent since 2002			0
in women , cases rose by 15 per cent over the period , to 15,675			0
‘ while men remain more likely to smoke than women , the gap has narrowed , ’ said the @entity27 report			1
women tended to be diagnosed with cancer at younger ages than men , with breast cancer responsible for 44 per cent of all cancers among women aged 25 - 59 years			1
in older age groups men were more likely to be diagnosed and overall , cancer was more prevalent among men than women			0
@entity108 , of @entity109 , said : ‘ every year , around 275,000 people are diagnosed with cancer in @entity45			2
the biggest risk factor is simply getting older			0
‘ but 40 per cent of cancers can be attributed to lifestyle factors			2
cutting down on alcohol , keeping a healthy weight , avoiding sunburn and being more active can help reduce the risk			0
’ @entity118 , chief executive of @entity119 , said : ‘ it is startling that the number of new cases of cancer diagnosed has soared by nearly a fifth in the last ten years			2
‘ however it is important to note this overall figure disguises a wide variation across the cancer types			0
‘ the figures also reveal a worrying gender gap			0
@entity109 affects women more in younger age groups , but men are significantly worse affected over the age of 60			0
the reasons for this are only partially understood			0
