he ’s always smiling , but today he has a greater reason than already emerging as the virtuoso performer from this @entity4 season , to be happy			2
@entity0 , the only driver outside of @entity7 and @entity8 , to win a grand prix this season , has reached the grand old age of 25			1
so , does he have anything planned to celebrate hitting a quarter of a century ? ‘ no. not really , ’ the @entity11 says			1
‘ perhaps , i ’ll get a haircut			2
’ it ’s an answer which may have @entity15 , the 1976 @entity16 , whose notoriety for his frivolous conduct away from the track was arguably greater than his displays in a race car , turning in his grave			0
birthday boy : @entity24 star @entity0 celebrated his 25th birthday on monday but @entity0 , who moved to @entity26 to pursue his motor racing career six years ago , insists his partying days are all but a distant memory			1
‘ i guess when i first came here i was probably 19 - years - old , and there was a pretty big group of young kids here who we used to boogie with , ’ he says			0
‘ but my boogie days are over			2
’ on track , and @entity0 has played the role of party - pooper at @entity24 this season ; expected to be second fiddle to four - times world champion @entity40 , following his promotion from the team ’s junior outfit @entity42 , the @entity11 has upset the odds			1
not only is he ahead of his more established team - mate in the drivers ’ championship by 23 points , he has also qualified in front of the @entity51 six times from the opening eight races			0
indeed , of the four grands prix they have both finished in @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , and @entity59 - where @entity0 claimed his maiden grand prix win after passing @entity8 in the most dramatic of finales - he has finished ahead of @entity40 on each occasion			1
all smiles : @entity64 shares a laugh with @entity66 ( right ) at @entity67 in @entity68 ‘ coming into a @entity16 - winning team you try not to be like that kid on the first day at school , you ease into it , ’ @entity0 explains			2
‘ but now i feel like i can be who i am and i do n’t have to be someone different			0
‘ obviously you want to win as soon as you can and to have already done it in the first part of the year was good			2
i ’ve had a lot of great results already this year which has done a lot for me confidence wise , and that just topped it off			0
’ unlike his predecessor @entity84 , who endured a tulmutuous four - year partnership alongside @entity40 at @entity24 , @entity0 enjoys a healthy relationship with the reigning @entity16			1
‘ we do get along outside the car and i think we ’ve really handled the year well , ’ @entity0 said			2
‘ although in the car it is different			0
no - one is even close to being a friend when they get in the car			0
’ upon his switch to @entity24 , @entity0 made a deliberate attempt to raise his professionalism , admitting he could n’t have joined the team and acted ‘ like a clown ’			1
posers : @entity11 @entity0 poses next to current @entity102 touring car champion @entity101 but the @entity11 , eight races into his @entity24 career , admits he still enjoys playing practical jokes away from the cockpit , despite the last laugh usually falling on him			1
‘ they play jokes on me , ’ he says , referring to his team of mechanics			0
‘ on sunday mornings , i get in the car and i do a few things in the cockpit			0
i have to take my shoes off to get in the car			0
but they glued my shoes together on the floor			0
i put my feet in the shoes , went to walk off , and nearly face planted			0
but i ’ll get them back , i ’m just being patient			0
’ ahead of this weekend ’s @entity102 @entity121 , @entity0 is a whopping 83 points adrift of championship leader @entity8			1
but does he expect the @entity51 , who holds the equivalent of a race victory over @entity7 to win the title ? ‘ it will all come down to who has got the clearest mind , and who is thinking the straightest on a sunday , ’ he says			1
‘ both @entity8 and @entity7 are very evenly paced			1
@entity8 has had more luck in terms of reliability , but i think that will all even itself out over the course of the year and if it does it will be the smartest driver who wins			1
who that is i do n’t know			0
@entity8 is a bit more stable and consistent but @entity7 , on his day , can be very strong , and if he has more of those days than @entity8 , then i think that might be enough			1

@entity0 insists his partying days are all behind him
