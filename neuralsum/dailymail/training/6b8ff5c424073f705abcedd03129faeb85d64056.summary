people in @entity1 are undergoing risky surgery in order to make their voice more masculine or feminine people in @entity1 are undergoing risky surgery in order to make their voices more masculine or feminine			1
voice operations are the latest in a booming cosmetic surgery market , with doctors offering the procedures reporting that demand for the surgery has risen steadily in recent years			1
several clinics now offer people the surgery - which was traditionally carried out on patients undergoing a sex change			1
this is despite the known risk that surgery can cause loss of voice altogether , as well as pneumonia			1
academics say the rising popularity of these procedures shows the pressure @entity1 people are under to conform to gender stereotypes			1
one person who has had the surgery is @entity32 , 23 , who endured years of being mocked for his ' girly ' high pitched voice			1
' for many years , my classmates and colleagues made fun of me because of my voice , calling me a sissy , ' @entity32 told @entity41 journalists			1
' i could n't get a girlfriend either			0
' women did n't see me as a real man , and instead treated me like one of their female friends because of my girly voice			1
' @entity32 's voice did not drop during puberty and in his job as a call centre operator , he was frequently mistaken for a woman			2
people also assumed he was gay because of the way he spoke			2
so despite the potential risks of the surgery , he decided to go ahead and have an operation which would make his voice lower			1
it involved cutting a segment of cartilage from his larynx and injecting @entity65 into his vocal cords			0
mr @entity67 , an @entity68 surgeon at @entity69 in @entity70 , told @entity71 that @entity65 causes the vocal chords to become shorter and more loose , deepening the voice			2
mr @entity67 carries out around two ‘ voice surgeries ’ a month , usually on patients undergoing a sex change , or patients with a defect in their voice through birth or injury			1
he said @entity32 's case is unusual because normally females transitioning to becoming male who are hoping for a deeper voice would be given testosterone therapy which works well to deepen their voice 's pitch			2

here , he explains to @entity71 how a procedure to lower the pitch of the voice would work ... mr @entity67 said : ‘ the pitch of the voice is determined by length , the thickness , and the tension of the vocal chords			2
‘ you can stretch the vocal chords - the thinner they become , the higher the voice will go			2
‘ the thicker and the more lax the vocal chords , the deeper you ’ll go			0
‘ @entity65 makes the chords shorter , flatter and more floppy , deepening the voice			2
‘ the chords are also attached to a bit of horse - shoe shaped cartilage called thyroid cartilage			0
‘ if you cut a little bit of cartilage out and drop it back , this shortens , stiffens the chords and the voice will become deeper			2
’ he added that the @entity65 injection is usually temporary			0
‘ it ’s a vacuous aim if you inject it into the vocal chords because it ’ll wear off			0
so they keep having to come back			0
' he added that the procedure carries well - known risks			0
he said : ‘ if you have too much you weaken the chords so they can no longer come together and you ’ll lose your voice			2
‘ the reason we have vocal cords is originally to protect the lungs from things going down the wrong way			0
‘ there ’s a risk of causing pneumonia by paralysing them			2
' people having the procedure would have to know about the risks : losing the voice , the chest infections			1
’ @entity32 underwent a surgical procedure presumably because he was already male and so testosterone therapy would not be appropriate			0
. he explained how the procedure works : ‘ the vocal chords are attached to a bit of horse - shoe shaped cartilage called thyroid cartilage			0
‘ if you cut a little bit of cartilage out and drop it back , this shortens , stiffens the chords and the voice will become deeper			2
’ ‘ injecting @entity65 makes the chords shorter , flatter and more floppy , deepening the voice			2
however , he added that the @entity65 injection is usually temporary			0
you use it for wrinkles ; it only works for three to six months			0
which is why people have to keep going back for more			0
' it ’s a vacuous aim if you inject it into the vocal cords because it ’ll wear off			0
so they keep having to come back for more injections			0
' patients risk losing their voice temporarily , and catching chest infections , he added			1
he said : ‘ if you have too much you weaken the chords so they can no longer come together and you ’ll lose your voice			0
‘ the reason we have vocal cords originally is to protect the lungs from things going down the wrong way			0
even animals who do n't speak have vocal chords for this purpose			0
‘ there ’s a risk of causing pneumonia by paralysing them			0
people having the procedure would have to know about the risks : losing the voice , the chest infections			1
’ one @entity1 doctor says he has performed more than 200 vocal surgeries over the last four years			1
@entity189 , a doctor from the @entity190 , said most people who came to him for surgery were men like @entity32 with a high - pitched voice but wanted to sound more ' manly '			1
women with low - pitched voices who wanted to sound more ' girly ' also opted for the procedure			0
one manager at a centre that carries out the operations said demand for the surgery from @entity1 has risen in recent years			1
@entity203 , a manager of the @entity204 in @entity205 , said four years ago about 20 @entity1 clients came to the clinic each year			1
last year , around 100 @entity1 patients visited , she said			1
he wanted to sound deeper after years of his ' girly ' voice being mocked many were seeking to improve their competitiveness in the job market			1
different procedures exist , but one option is to place titanium plates between the throat muscles , causing the vocal chord to stretch , raising the pitch , the @entity222 reports			0
an incision can be made in the vocal chord , or part of it can be burnt away with a laser			0
this causes scarring which stiffens the chord , making the pitch higher			0
many might dismiss such cosmetic surgery as a symptom of vanity , but some academics blame rigid @entity1 gender roles			1
' gender is performed , in the sense that men are expected to behave in ways that conform to preconceived ideas of masculinity , and women are expected to behave in ways that conform to preconceived ideas of femininity , ' @entity241 , of @entity242 , told the @entity41			1
people who already have normal voices , but still seek vocal surgery are doing so out of pressure to conform more fully to gender stereotypes , she said			1
she added : ' our society needs to be more inclusive of differences within genders , so that people with unconventional voices or other characteristics that do n't conform to their gender stereotype wo n't be pressured into the pain of surgery			1
