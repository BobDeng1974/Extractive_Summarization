by @entity0 published : 12:14 est , 6 march 2014 updated : 13:17 est , 6 march 2014 the number of patients in @entity4 carrying antibiotic - resistant bacteria has soared soaring numbers of patients in @entity9 are carrying bacteria that is resistant to antibiotics , hospitals are reporting			1
the number of laboratory - confirmed cases of a strain of gut bacteria that can destroy antibiotics has risen from just five in 2006 , to more than 600 in 2013			1
health officials have said that the increase in cases has shown the ‘ urgent need ’ for hospitals to implement plans and procedures to stem the spread of antibiotic resistance			2
@entity4 ( @entity25 ) has launched a new toolkit for hospitals to help them control antibiotic - resistant bacterial infections caused by carbapenemase - producing @entity29 ( @entity30 )			1
this is the name given to some strains of gut bacteria that can be resistant to carbapenem antibiotics			1
carbapenems are considered to be ‘ last resort ’ antibiotics which medics use to treat difficult infections when other antibiotics would or have failed , @entity25 said			0
while infections caused by @entity30 can still be treated with other antibiotics , treatment may be more difficult , a spokesman said			0
he added that in the last decade there has been a ‘ sustained ’ increase in the number of @entity30 cases			2
about two thirds of trusts in @entity4 have had between one and 20 patients identified with @entity30 carriage or infection over the past five years			2
this includes two trusts in @entity55 that have had more than 100 patients identified with @entity30			0
@entity25 ’s medical director dr @entity57 said : ‘ in order to minimise the wide spread of these multi-drug resistant infections across @entity4 it is essential that all trusts are aware of this toolkit			1
' they must also develop plans for detecting and managing patients with infections caused by @entity30 and other antibiotic - resistant bacteria			0
‘ these infections are already causing national concern due to the observed increasing trends in the number of infections , outbreaks and clusters across @entity4			2
‘ we now have a window of opportunity , if we act quickly and decisively , to address this very real public health threat and prevent widespread problems by minimising the negative impact of these organisms			0
’ in @entity4 in 2006 there were five cases of a gut bacteria that is resistant to antibiotics			1
last year there were more than 600 cases of the same bacterial infection @entity4 ’s chief medical officer professor dame @entity89 said : ‘ antibiotic resistance poses a real threat to our ability to treat diseases			1
‘ although there has been an increase in this strain of bacteria , the new toolkit will ensure that hospitals are well placed to detect , manage and control any cases			1
systems of monitoring for resistant bacteria are essential in safeguarding the effect of our antibiotics			0
’ health experts have previously warned of the ‘ catastrophic threat ’ of people becoming resistant to antibiotics , saying that in just 20 years ’ time routine operations could become deadly if we lose the ability to fight infection			0
last year , @entity114 said that resistance to antibiotics is one of the greatest threats to modern health			0
she said many of the drugs are being used unnecessarily for mild infections or illnesses which should not be treated with antibiotics - helping to create resistance .			0

number of cases of a gut bacteria that can destroy antibiotics has soared
in 2006 there were five cases , last year there were more than 600
@entity4 launched ' toolkit ' for hospitals to control spread
