' @entity10 had never met his attacker before and there were no words spoken prior to the sudden and unprovoked stabbing the graduate said : ' to make himself appear like the @entity17 , as far as i ’m concerned , is something that he failed in doing because he has n’t frightened me			1

@entity10 fled to the gym reception area pipe waited for an hour before choosing @entity10 to attack at @entity115 ( pictured ) ' i got stabbed in the face , which i did n’t realise till i got to hospital			1
' @entity10 said he believes @entity6 would have gone on to kill others that day had gym workers not stepped in to help			1

he could n’t get out of my grip and other people would have got involved at some point			0
