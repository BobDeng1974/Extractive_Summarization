by @entity0 despite the sun being 93 million miles away , one amateur astronomer has n't let that stop him capturing incredible close ups - from his back garden			2
@entity7 stargazer @entity6 used off the shelf equipment to capture a series of stunning images			1
they include bursts of flames , known as prominences , flickering from the sun 's surface that are only visible when the sun is most active			1
@entity7 amateur astronomer @entity6 has captured incredible images of the sun ( pictured ) from his own back garden using off the shelf equipment			1
the images include bursts of flames - known as prominences - flickering from the suns surface ' the pictures are captured in my own backyard , ' said @entity6			1
' my backyard lays north so i can see pretty good to the east where the sun rises in the morning - the best time to capture these types of images			1
' a solar prominence is a large , bright feature extending outward from the @entity38 's surface			2
a prominence forms over timescales of about a day , and the red - glowing looped material is plasma , a hot gas comprised of electrically charged hydrogen and helium			0
an erupting prominence occurs when such a structure becomes unstable and bursts outward , releasing the plasma			0
he admitted that the images are difficult to capture , so he used specialist techniques to produce the final versions			0
using what he terms an astrocamera , set to capture thousands of pictures in less than 30 seconds , and h - alpha filters , @entity6 is able to select the frames that are sharp			1
he then stacks and overlays them using specialist software , producing one clear image			0
@entity6 said he has got the technique down to a fine art after three years of work			0
' it takes a lot of practice to capture these pictures , ' he said			0
seen here is a prominence extending from the sun 's surface in one of @entity6 's pictures			1
a solar prominence is a large , bright feature extending outward from the @entity38 's surface			2
a prominence forms over timescales of about a day , and the red - glowing looped material is plasma this close - up of the sun shows how its surface is a constantly churning and changing place			2
' my backyard lays north so i can see pretty good to the east where the sun rises in the morning - the best time to capture these types of images , ' said @entity6 ' there are lots of challenges such as the warmth of a summers day can ruin the capture by causing " vibrations " across the image			1
' even with the most expensive equipment it is still a challenge to take a decent picture			0
' i see lots of people with the most expensive equipment , but they are still unable to capture a proper picture			0
' you need lots of patience , and one has got to learn what there is to see on the sun itself , too			0
' it has taken me a lot of practice , but to make a full image i now only need five minutes of clear sky			0
' i shoot four images in total , two of which are of the sun 's surface and two more of the prominence , before stacking these together to create on sharp image			2
' but @entity6 warns wannabe astronomers against staring at the sun without proper protection			2
he said : ' you should only attempt these types of pictures when using proper solar scopes purchased from a specialist			0
' this incredible animation taken on 6 june 2012 shows the moment a bird flew in front of @entity6 's view of the last transit of @entity139 visible form @entity137 until december 2117			1
@entity6 used an astrocamera , capturing thousands of images at once , before stacking the images together using specialist software to make the final photos is it the sun , or bacteria ? @entity6 's specialist techniques allow him to get differing views of the sun. this picture shows , in detail , features on the sun including prominences into its atmosphere and features on its surface as it continues to churn and blast out heat and light			1

a @entity7 astronomer has capture *remarkable* images of the sun
@entity6 used off - the - shelf equipment to capture the stunning photos
his images include solar prominences , bursts of flames from the surface
and he also took *photography* of the transit of @entity139 on 6 june 2012
the pictures were captured from @entity6 's backyard with an astrocamera
