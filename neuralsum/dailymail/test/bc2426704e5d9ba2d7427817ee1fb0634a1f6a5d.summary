it 's hard to know quite what motivated the @entity2 to rescue teenage sex slaves in @entity4 at the same time he faced damning allegations that he had slept with one in @entity7			1
but one thing is for certain : it definitely took guts			2
with a remarkable initiative combining the unlikely bedfellows of fashion and compassion , it can be revealed that prince @entity2 has personally changed the fate of more than 100 vulnerable young women in @entity17			1
rescued from brothels and domestic servitude , child labour and human trafficking , the girls have been taught tailoring and silk printing through a charity called @entity25 to @entity26			1
moved : prince @entity2 during his visit to an @entity4 refuge in 2012 , which inspired him to form the charity their kimonos , duster coats , pyjamas , scarves and make - up bags are sold online and on the @entity38 @entity37 by @entity39 , with the proceeds paid back to the women as a salary			1
what makes this new mission all the more compelling is it has emerged just months after @entity2 was mired in allegations that he had enjoyed an improper relationship with @entity7 ‘ sex slave ’ @entity48 , who had been working for his former friend @entity49 , an @entity7 billionaire			1
the claims , furiously denied by the @entity2 , have now been struck out of @entity7 court records , effectively clearing his name			1
he was inspired to launch @entity25 to @entity26 after visiting a girls ’ refuge on an official trip to @entity4			1
he came up with the idea less than an hour after leaving a home run by the women ’s @entity59 and swiftly donated £ 10,000 seed capital to fund the first bales of silk			2
speaking exclusively to @entity63 yesterday , the @entity2 said : ‘ i was incredibly impressed with the work of the women ’s @entity59 during my @entity66 visit to @entity4 in may 2012			1
‘ i could see that it would be possible to complement [ founder and chairman ] @entity71 ’s important work in supporting vulnerable young women to develop a skill to become economically active by helping find a route to market for their products			1
it is incredible to see what the team has achieved			2
@entity48 had been working for @entity2 's former friend @entity49 , an @entity7 billionaire ( pictured together above ) ‘ i am proud to have helped their products find a market and be sold in the @entity38			1
‘ most importantly , this has helped the women ’s @entity59 support more young people to develop skills , which is an important area of focus for my work			2
’ one of the young women who moved him so deeply was @entity92 , now 19			2
she was chosen to show the @entity2 how to block - print silk when he visited the refuge			1
in return , he left two copies of @entity100 ’s @entity99 , a book written by his former wife @entity102			0
the child of two tea garden labourers from northern bengal , @entity92 was abducted aged 12 when she went to a travelling fair with friends			2
lured to @entity108 with the promise of a job to help her support her family , she escaped only to find herself living as a ‘ railway child ’ at the city ’s station			2
illiterate and destitute , she had no way home until she was taken in by the @entity117 where she met the @entity2 on his trip			1
she was among the first girls to sign up to @entity25 to @entity26 and has so far earned almost 40,000 rupees – approximately £ 430 – supplying silk goods to @entity39			1
she has also been reunited with her family near @entity123			0
‘ we traced her parents but they were resistant to her coming home because they believed she had been prostituted , ’ revealed @entity71			0
‘ once we had told them her real story and that she ’d learned @entity129 and @entity130 and maths , and that she had a craft and was earning a living , they changed their mind			2
’ @entity92 said : ‘ i am doing well now and so is my mother			0
she was sick and i have been able to pay for medical treatment for her			0
‘ i have earned almost 40,000 rupees through @entity25 to @entity26 and i have a skill which will help my future			1
i hope i keep getting orders for my work			0
i hope it wo n’t stop			0
’ prince @entity2 ’s 25 - year - old daughter , @entity144 , and his former wife @entity145 , have both paid private visits to help support the charity , and it is understood they continue to play an active role in promoting the initiative			1
the @entity2 ’s eldest daughter @entity151 , 26 , was recently criticised for taking as many as nine holidays in the space of just a few months , although she is understood to have recently accepted a job at a private equity firm in @entity156			1
@entity144 also works in the city for an online auction house			0
other workers with @entity25 to @entity26 include @entity160 , 25 , who was taken prisoner in a red light area after running away from home			1
‘ she was locked up in a brothel and beaten , and then starved for days for refusing to have sex , ’ said @entity71			2
profits : about £ 20,000 from @entity39 sales has gone to the charity since it was set up with products sold in their @entity38 stores ‘ finally she escaped and found refuge in a youth club whose leaders called the police			2
she was , and still remains , mentally disturbed by her ordeal but she ’s making excellent progress			0
she is happy and confident working as a tailor			0
’ another key to @entity26 success story is @entity181 , 21 , an epilepsy sufferer who is so traumatised by her past that she has never been able to explain how she came to be on the streets of @entity17			1
@entity71 said : ‘ she now has a bank account like any other working woman			0
it has totally changed her life			2
‘ poverty makes these women victims			2
they suffer ills because they have little or no capacity to earn			0
they live with abuse – mental , physical and sexual – just to be certain of food and shelter			0
‘ the @entity2 understood that and wanted to make a difference – as the father of two daughters i think the plight of the girls here resonated with him			1
‘ he wanted to given them their independence			0
handmade : a silk @entity39 kimono ‘ there was no talk about a project or a donation at the time of his visit			0
the only thing he asked me was , “ what do you think it will take to rehabilitate these girls ? ” ‘ i spoke to him about alternative income earning , a regular outlet to sell their work , and skills development to make their craft more marketable			0
his aides called less than an hour after he ’d left and set up a meeting the same night			0
‘ he had already spoken to the @entity145 about us and she expressed her wish to help out in whatever way she could			0
the name key to @entity26 was her idea			1
’ @entity71 added : ‘ while i understood that their heart was in the right place , i also wondered whether busy people like them would find time to give it more thought			0
‘ not only did they find the time , they were incredibly enthusiastic and remain so today			0
‘ it was prince @entity2 ’s skills at connecting businesses that linked us to @entity39			1
it ’s nothing short of a miracle for us to have a market in the @entity38			0
’ @entity71 came to @entity256 for talks with the @entity2 ’s team at @entity259 just three months after their initial meeting , and by summer 2013 @entity25 to @entity26 was up and running			1
it fulfilled its first order to @entity39 , every piece individually signed by the woman who made it , in july 2013			2
since then approximately 4,300 items have been sold			0
yesterday , the @entity37 giant , which sent designer @entity268 to @entity4 to assist with colours , patterns and quality control , confirmed the original deal for four collections had been extended to include at least one more later this year			1
@entity39 declined to discuss sales figures , but it is understood around £ 20,000 has so far been paid by the company , which makes no profit from the scheme , to the @entity278			0
this then sends the money back to @entity25 to @entity26 in @entity17			1
in addition , the charity supplied 750 goodie bags for one of prince @entity2 ’s @entity286 events for entrepreneurs last month , where 200 of its scarves were also on sale			1
the scheme is another of his business - to - business initiatives uniting start - ups and entrepreneurs with angel investors , venture capitalists and mentors			0
a @entity259 source said that the @entity2 remained very supportive of the project and used every opportunity – such as @entity300 – to promote it			1
‘ it ’s been completely empowering for the girls here , ’ said @entity71			0
‘ it ’s about honour and dignity , and having control over their own future			0
‘ it means they can look ahead and put their past behind them			0
