det con @entity98 , said : ‘ while the victim has suffered serious injuries , it is not an understatement to say he could have died as a result of this violent and seemingly unprovoked assault			2

we also need to speak to the women he was with and i am again appealing for information as to her identity			0
‘ i would encourage these two , if they see this appeal to come forward as it will only be a matter of time before we come for you			0
the incident is similar to the death or @entity119 , a 19 - year - old @entity120 who died from his head injuries after he was punched in the face by 20 - year - old @entity124 , now serving four years for manslaughter ‘ with the festive party season in full swing i also want to remind people that just a single punch can prove fatal , as was demonstrated with the tragic death of @entity119 in @entity10 in june this year			1
