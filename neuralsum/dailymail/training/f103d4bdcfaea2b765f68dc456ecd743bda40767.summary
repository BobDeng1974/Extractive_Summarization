@entity0 made his first outing in a @entity3 shirt as late goals from @entity5 and @entity6 saw the @entity3 win their latest pre-season friendly			1
with the game goalless and seemingly staying that way , @entity5 broke the deadlock with a typical poacher 's goal with 11 minutes remaining			1
latching on to a loose ball in the box , the @entity15 international made no mistake from close range			0

@entity6 's magnificent strike doubled the lead soon after to give the scoreline a fair reflection of the home side 's dominance			1
it was a stunning effort from the 21 - year - old , firing home from 25 yards to give keeper @entity45 no chance			0
elsewhere , @entity79 continued to impress for @entity3 , with new signing @entity39 also making his first appearance for the club			2
but an injury to @entity37 , who hobbled off just before half - time , will give boss @entity85 something to think about			2
hobbling off : @entity87 leaves the pitch after sustaining an injury in the pre-season friendly no contest : @entity6 and @entity24 ' @entity48 compete for a high ball at @entity93 @entity3 conclude their pre-season on saturday with a tie against @entity97 outfit @entity96			1
they open their @entity99 campaign with a trip to @entity101			0
