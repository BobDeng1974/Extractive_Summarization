by @entity0 @entity1 , codenamed @entity2 , was one of the @entity4 's most prized spies she ended her days in a cosy , third - floor rented flat in a sheltered housing complex			1
untroubled by the problems of the world , and with the added comfort of her married daughter @entity10 living nearby , @entity1 enjoyed the tranquillity of the small development ringed with flowering trees , and got on with her jam - making until her death , aged 93			1
in many other countries , the grey - haired great - grandmother would have ended her days in prison , or even been shot			1
for mrs @entity19 was no ordinary granny			1
over a period of 35 years , she had been a spy for the @entity4 , passing on @entity24 ’s nuclear secrets that enabled the @entity25 to catch up in building the atomic bomb			1
two weeks ago , nine years after her death , @entity1 ’s barely - known name unexpectedly re-emerged when the @entity29 , a file of top secret @entity25 documents , was made available to the public for the first time			1
the file arrived in @entity24 in 1992 when kgb major @entity34 defected to @entity24 , bringing with him , in six trunks , an archive of 30 years of @entity25 secrets			1
intriguingly , it included profiles of 200 @entity24 @entity4 collaborators written by their @entity43 handlers			1
mentioned only by codenames , @entity45 and @entity46 , of the infamous ‘ @entity47 ’ , got critical mention : burgess for not dressing tidily and being ‘ constantly under the influence of alcohol ’ , and @entity46 for his ‘ drunk spells ’ and being ‘ not very good at keeping secrets ’			1
@entity1 , on the other hand — codenamed @entity2 — was a model of reliability			1
her handler described her as ‘ a loyal , trustworthy , disciplined agent ’ who passed to the @entity4 a large amount of vital data			1
unlike those @entity64 - style seductresses whose treachery is based in the boudoir , mrs @entity1 was a very different kind of agent			1
she was , in many ways , the perfect spy , living during most of her long years of treason in a pebble - dash semi in @entity72 , @entity74 - @entity73 , with her maths and chemistry teacher husband @entity76 , growing fresh vegetables in her back garden allotment and bringing up their daughter @entity10			1
no life could have looked more ordinary			2
except for one thing — she worked at the @entity24 @entity84 offices in @entity85 , central @entity73			1
behind this dull company name was an important firm involved in vital research			2
towards the end of the war , it was carrying out highly classified government research into the properties of uranium , as part of @entity24 ’s atomic bomb project			1
@entity1 ( everyone called her ‘ @entity99 ’ ) had joined the company as a clerk in 1937			1
as a member of the @entity103 , and later the @entity104 , she had already been recruited as an agent at a meeting of the @entity107			2
her bookbinder father was a @entity111 immigrant and left - wing activist whose slogan was ‘ down with everything that ’s up , and up with everything that ’s down ’			2
he founded the @entity115 in @entity116			2
her mother , too , was a suffragette with far - left sympathies			2
prized : mrs @entity1 , pictured at her home in @entity72 , @entity73 , in 1999 , was a member of the advisory committee on the atom bomb project - a significant help for the @entity25 although her father died when she was six , the family still held left - wing views which the bright child absorbed from an early age			1
but as she became head girl of @entity130 and captained the hockey team , few could have predicted the extraordinary outcome of such an early communist indoctrination			2
the girl who had become bored with university life at @entity116 after only a year was soon being promoted from clerk to secretary			2
at the height of the war in 1943 , she took time off to have a child , @entity10			2
when she returned to the firm in 1944 , she went to work for the director , dr @entity142 , who wanted @entity143 because he knew she could cope with the technical jargon			2
for the @entity4 , this was an unbelievable piece of good fortune , because @entity142 happened to be a member of the advisory committee on the atom bomb project			2
working so close to highly classified research , @entity143 had to go through a security vetting			2
incredibly , despite doubts about her extreme left - wing sympathies and links , she was cleared			2
indeed , so trusted was @entity143 that she had access to @entity142 ’s two safes			2
one was in his office and the other at his @entity73 home			0
he kept sensitive documents in both , sometimes holding evening meetings at home at which @entity143 was expected to be on hand			0
these usually ended so late that she stayed overnight			0
her consequent contribution of atomic intelligence to the @entity25 was incalculable , certainly big enough for the @entity168 to declare that she had made ‘ a valuable contribution to the development of work in this field ’			0
@entity143 ’s work for the @entity25 continued right up until her retirement from the company in 1972 , when she was 60			0
through all those years , her husband , a fellow @entity104 member who died in 1985 , knew she was spying for the @entity4			1
but to the neighbours in @entity179 , @entity72 , a pleasant street of semis and discreet net curtains , @entity143 was viewed as a charming old lady who just happened to be a bit eccentric and very openly left - wing			1
for example , she used @entity187 tea mugs and habitually posted copies of the communist @entity189 through the letterboxes of 32 of her neighbours			0
no sniff of suspicion : to her neighbours she was a charming old lady who was a little bit eccentric everyone liked her			1
one resident , @entity196 , 78 , a former bomb disposal unit @entity199 corporal , recalls @entity143 doing the shopping at the co-op for other elderly neighbours , visiting anyone she thought might be lonely or unwell			0
‘ we all knew where her politics lay			0
i remember her talking to me once about @entity206 , ’ he says			0
‘ she thought he was the best			0
‘ and she had her gardening : flowers at the front , vegetables at the back			0
who would have thought she was a spy ? i certainly did n’t			1
’ even after she was publicly exposed in 1999 as having worked for the @entity4 , neighbours found it very hard to condemn the nice old girl who ’d been such a good neighbour for decades			0
‘ she was lovely , a pure lady , ’ says @entity216 , who was a neighbour for more than 20 years			1
@entity217 worked out who ‘ @entity220 ’ was in 1992 , soon after @entity25 defector @entity34 arrived in @entity24 with his @entity4 file			1
but a decision not to put her on trial was quickly taken so that the collapsing @entity25 would remain in ignorance about just how much we knew			0
when she was unmasked publicly as ‘ @entity220 ’ seven years later , no action was taken against her because by then she was 87 , and @entity226 , then @entity227 home secretary , decided that at her age , nothing was to be gained from sending her to prison			1
some believe , however , the real reason she was not put on trial was to avoid embarrassing details emerging about @entity217 ’s mistake in allowing her to work as a personal secretary at the very heart of @entity24 ’s secret atomic research , even though she was known to have @entity240 sympathies			1
for her part , @entity19 did n’t allow exposure of her treachery to ruin her @entity245 delivery routine , which continued uninterrupted			0
had she seen for herself her @entity4 handler ’s description of her as ‘ loyal ’ and ‘ trustworthy ’ , it would have come as no surprise , for this is precisely how she saw herself in doing her bit to ‘ prevent the defeat ’ of the communist creed			0
‘ i did not want money			0
it was not that side i was interested in			0
i just wanted @entity168 to be on equal footing with the @entity260 , ’ she told the media crowding at her front door in 1999 after being publicly exposed , before politely closing it			0
in @entity263 , @entity264 , 120 miles away , her daughter @entity10 , a school laboratory technician , was astonished at the revelations about her elderly mother , and described herself as being ‘ in a state of disbelief ’			0
when her identity was revealed , the then home secretary ‘ whatever she may have done , i love her , ’ said the mother of two			0
‘ she ’s a very good person , very strong and totally unmaterialistic			0
’ three years after being exposed , @entity143 sold the semi in @entity72 and moved to be near her daughter , renting a flat in the sheltered housing complex			1
‘ it was a complete shock at the time , ’ says @entity10 , now 71			0
‘ i talked to her about the spying , but she told me very little of what she had done , though she did say my father did n’t approve			0
but she always felt she did the right thing			0
she told me she would have been prepared to be tried as a war criminal and would have accepted a prison sentence			0
’ right up to her death in 2005 , mrs @entity1 never wavered from the conviction that what she did was right			1
the @entity4 awarded her the prestigious military honour the @entity290			0
it also offered her a pension of £ 20 a month			0
she declined it — her spying was , after all , a matter of principle .			0

@entity1 , codenamed @entity2 , was a prized spy in @entity296
passed on @entity24 's top nuclear secrets over a period of 35 years
her name emerged in the @entity29 nine years after she died
@entity304 believed she was a charming eccentric old lady
