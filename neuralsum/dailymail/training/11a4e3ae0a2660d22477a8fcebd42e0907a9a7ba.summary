@entity3 @entity2 hostage @entity0 has appeared in another video released by the extremist group in their latest piece of propaganda against the @entity8			1
the photojournalist , who went missing last year while working in @entity10 , sits at a table dressed in an orange jumpsuit in the video titled : ' @entity14 from the @entity3 detainee @entity0 , episode five '			1
staring solemnly at the camera , mr @entity0 describes himself as ' the @entity3 citizen abandoned by my government and a prisoner of the @entity22 for nearly two years '			1
' now unless we tried something stupid like escaping or doing something we should n't , we were treated well by the @entity22			2
' some of us who tried to escape were water - boarded by our captain as @entity50 prisoners are water - boarded by their @entity33 captors			1
' we read books , played recreational games and gave lectures on our specialist subjects			1
it was n't a bad life			1
' unlike other videos , a small stack of papers and a pen lie in front of him on the table			2
they are , he claims , emails between the families of @entity33 hostages and the @entity33 government			2
reciting the alleged words of relatives of journalists taken hostage by @entity74 , mr @entity0 says that no help was given to families communicating with @entity2 by @entity33 representatives			1
@entity78 , he describes how other @entity80 hostages were released after negotiations were successfully carried out by @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 governments			2
@entity86 from pieces of paper mr @entity0 alleges that @entity33 governments did nothing to secure the safe return of hostages the video is the fifth in a series , described by the hostage as ' programmes ' in which he describes life under @entity2 rule ' but it was clear something was different with the @entity3 and @entity33 , ' he says			1
' while there was dialogue for everyone else , the @entity3 and the @entity33 were stone - walled - it was completely silent			1
' as the footage continues , mr @entity0 talks of how the hostages did not give up hope of being saved by @entity8 intervention			1
and in a potential nod to his unimaginable bravery , or , a cruel taunt by jihadis written into his script , he says : ' the human mind has an incredibly tough capacity for self - defence in difficult situations			2
' the fifth video comes after his sister said earlier this week she thinks he believes ' two - thirds ' of what he says on camera			1
in september , @entity33 journalist @entity126 ( right ) was killed by @entity2 in a gruesome video that depicted his beheading			1
his murder came just weeks after another @entity33 reporter , @entity130 ( left ) , was killed @entity131 made an emotional appeal for her brother 's return , pleading with the terrorists to reopen lines of contact to secure his safe journey home			0
just two days ago , mr @entity0 's father died following a public appeal from his hospital bed			1
@entity143 , 80 , spoke directly to @entity2 extremists in a heartfelt video , pleading for his son 's return			1
his grieving family revealed they did not know whether mr @entity0 's captors had received the messages , or whether he had even been informed of his father 's death			1
in september , @entity33 journalist @entity126 was killed by @entity2 in a gruesome video that depicted his beheading			1
his murder came just weeks after another @entity33 reporter , @entity130 , was killed			0
@entity3 aid workers @entity158 and @entity159 have also been beheaded by the terror group			1
' hello , i 'm @entity0 , the @entity3 citizen abandoned by my own government and a prisoner of the @entity22 for nearly two years			1
' in this programme i 'm going to reveal to you some uncomfortable truths that have so far resulted in the executions of my former cellmates			0
' only the @entity3 and @entity33 prisoners were left behind after months of negotiations saw 16 other citizens from six @entity80 countries go home			1
' how was this allowed to happen ? ' we have to go back to 2013 when the @entity22 launched a long term operation to capture westerners entering @entity10 and they began the next phase of the operation - negotiating for our release with our governments through family and friends			1
' now unless we tried something stupid like escaping or doing something we should n't , we were treated well by the @entity22			2
some of us who tried to escape were water - boarded by our captors as @entity50 prisoners are water - boarded by their @entity33 captors			1
' our strange little community of prisoners had its share of problems but apart from the odd fight we lived together in relative harmony through uncertain times			0
' we read books , played recreational games and gave lectures on our specialist subjects			1
it was n't a bad life			1
' the first to leave was my friend , @entity206 journalist @entity204 ( sic ) in feb 2014			0
the @entity207 then made their first strong move by shooting one of our number - a @entity212 with no clear origin or story behind him			2
' the message was clear : do n't mess around when it comes to negotiations			2
' the @entity80 fell into line , two more @entity206 journalists left , then four @entity83 , their representatives having fulfilled the conditions for their release ' but it was clear something was different for the @entity3 and @entity33			1
while there was dialogue for everyone else the @entity3 and @entity33 were stone walled - it was completely silent			1
' ' now we knew our countries claimed to be non-negotiating when it came to situations like this but also knew examples when they had negotiated either under the table or through a third party			0
' due to the size and complexity of the situation , and the number of other countries involved ' we believed our governments would get us out in the end			0
so we waited patiently while everyone else went home to their loved ones			0
' finally we had movement in may			0
we made a video , wrote letters and made a voice recording			2
for us the @entity22 were asking for the release of @entity50 prisoners and their transfer to the @entity258			0
' it sounded very complicated but we were the biggest group from the biggest countries ( so ) there had to be a negotiation going on			0
' but by the time the other two @entity80 left , my friend @entity262 from @entity85 , another non-negotiating country , and @entity265 from @entity84 , it was clear to us we were in very big trouble			0
' now i have here a selection of emails between the @entity22 and families back home			0
' i do n't have much on the @entity3 so i assume there was even less discussion going on for them			1
so this is really all about the @entity33 and you 'll see that really the government was doing nothing , absolutely noting , to help the families involved			0
' i have a message here from one of the @entity33 prisoners on 11 june : " i would secure your sister 's release , if i could			0
it sounds like you care about her freedom			0
" you have surely seen the news , our government is a mess , they will not help			0
" another here , from the family of one of the @entity33 prisoners on july 17 2014 : ' our government is not being helpful			0
we have begged them so many times already			0
everyone has buried their heads in the sand , we feel we are caught in the middle between you and the @entity33 government and we are being punished			0
' we have reached out to our government but they have been non-responsive for some time now			0
' we do n't expect to get any help from our government at all and we feel foolish for believing them			2
" another on the 24 july says : " we are contacting people every day , you have given us a huge mountain to climb and we feel like a pawn in this political battle that we have been forced into			0
" i am taking everything you have said seriously , and am working as fast as i can			2
" ' now , the recurring element in these emails is the government , the @entity33 government was simply doing absolutely nothing , to help the families involved in this negotiation			0
' the @entity207 told us our government did n't care about us and we did n't believe them			2
they told us we were worthless and we did n't believe them			2
' we were told we 'd start to die and we did n't believe that either			2
the human mind has an incredibly tough capacity for self - defence in difficult situations			0
' but it was all true			0
our governments had chosen not to negotiate with the @entity22 through our families and friends			0
and while everyone else had fulfilled conditions for release , for us there was no deal			0
' join me in the next programme as we learn about a failed rescue to try to get us out , and you 'll hear about how one soldier was worth five prisoners and we were worth none			0
' mr @entity0 was among a collection of western journalists taken hostage in @entity10 by @entity2 jihadis last year			1
