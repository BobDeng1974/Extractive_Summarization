by @entity0 published : 03:26 est , 18 february 2013 updated : 04:21 est , 18 february 2013 one in three patients is putting their health at risk because they do not take their medication properly , costing the @entity5 an estimated £ 500 million every year			0
fears about potential side - effects and poor understanding of doctors ' instructions are partly responsible for the issue , according to a study			1
researchers analysing one million prescriptions found that the absence of symptoms and a lack of trust in pharmacists also played a part in people deciding to stop taking their medication			1
understanding : the @entity22 analysed one million prescriptions and found that a number of factors , such as side effects and poor instructions from doctors , were responsible for people not taking medication properly the @entity22 , is thought to be the first research project looking at adherence to medication in the @entity31			1
it found that certain ethnic groups are more likely to experience difficulties in understanding how to take medication			0
people whose primary language is @entity37 or @entity38 are particularly susceptible , as are those living in poorer inner - city areas			1
they found that people aged over 60 struggled with adherence to medication patterns			2
the study , carried out by researchers at @entity46 ’s @entity45 , was centred on the @entity47 , looking at those suffering from type 2 diabetes , hypothyroidism and high cholesterol			0
health bodies are facing increasing pressure to manage treatable , long - term conditions in an attempt to reduce hospital admissions			0
findings : the study , carried out by researchers at @entity59 , looked at those suffering from type 2 diabetes , hypothyroidism and high cholesterol the report recommended that healthcare systems should take account of a patient 's first language and offer more advice to those taking medication for long - term conditions			0
professor @entity72 , principal investigator for the @entity22 said : ' what is important about the @entity22 is that it identifies adherence patterns within an ethnically diverse inner city area with high levels of deprivation ; this is currently unchartered territory			2
' the results from this study have provided an intriguing insight into adherence behaviour within an inner - city population , whilst the focus group data provided context and understanding of the barriers to adherence from the patients ’ perspective			2
' dr @entity91 , investigator for the @entity22 added : ' we identified numerous groups in which adherence levels were lower than in the general population , but it is not possible at this time to identify why adherence is lower in these groups			1
' whilst the focus groups suggested possible reasons for non-adherence , we hope to explore these issues further and identify the primary reasons for non-adherence in these patient groups in future research			0

@entity22 analysed one million prescriptions
people often put off by side - effects and not understanding instructions
certain groups more susceptible to a lack of adherence to *guidelines*
those whose primary language is @entity37 and @entity38 struggled as did over- 60s
