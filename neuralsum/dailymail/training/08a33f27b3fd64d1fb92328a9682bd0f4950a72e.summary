' @entity7 was first admitted to a hospital in @entity32 , then moved to @entity33 , @entity34			1
doctors then decided that @entity7 would be better suited to psychiatric support , so she was transferred to secure psychiatric unit at the @entity38 in @entity39 , where violent patients were also being treated			1

she was sectioned in october for her anorexia but her weight has continued to fall in the last eight months she was then transferred to a hospital in @entity45 , but returned to @entity39 due to lack of funding			2
on tuesday she was transferred back to the @entity38 in @entity45 - a move which her family says saved her life			2
he mother said : ' it 's no joke to say that i would be planning her funeral now if she had n't finally made it to the centre in @entity45			1
it 's shocking , and i 'm absolutely appalled			1
' the @entity4 has got a lot to answer for			1
this is somebody 's life			1
everyone seems to blame someone else			2
' someone has to be responsible for what has happened			2
when i visited her in the psychiatric unit in @entity39 , it would take all my strength to fight back the tears			0
' she felt like she is being punished , that no one is listening to her			0
' @entity7 's struggle with weight loss began when she was 15 years old			1
she was bullied at college and stopped eating			0
a year later she received treatment at a hospital in @entity77 and made a good recovery			1
but @entity7 's problems resurfaced and by october she had lost half her body weight			1
she has now made a desperate plea for better services to treat mental health patients as she battles to stay alive			0
speaking from her hospital bed , she said : ' i am still a human being and i should be allowed to have a say in what is best for me			0
this is putting a huge strain on me and my family - financially and emotionally			0
' people need to start listening to patients with mental health problems			0
nurses are supposed to be helping people but they are becoming so clogged up with paper work - there is no care			2
' mrs @entity7 said @entity7 was awas a ' lovely and bubbly girl ' growing up but started to lose weight after getting bullied at school			1
' she would skip meals , or eat very little and throw the rest away			0
' i did n't know it at the time , but she was sneakily doing exercises in the middle of the night in her bedroom			0
' eventually someone at school realised that something was very wrong , and she was referred for help			0
' family : @entity7 ( right ) with her mother @entity13 , who has blasted the level of care her daughter has received she said she has felt helpless trying to get the appropriate care for @entity7 , especially while she was in @entity39			1
travelling to and from the different health units has also placed a financial strain on the family			0
' all the staff at @entity39 were lovely to @entity7 , but they did n't have the facilities to cope with her anorexia , ' she said			2
' all they could do there was keep her safe , but she was n't getting the treatment she needed			2
' she would be given meals and be left to get on with it			0
the ward did n't have to resources or skills to help her			0
' she was on a secure ward with very unwell patients who would be very loud and often violent			0
' there were panic alarms going off all night and she could barely sleep			0
because she was so small and petite , the other patients seemed to target her and she ended up with a few bruises			0
' it was quite terrifying for her , and there was no way she could begin her recovery in that environment			0
' it 's appalling how @entity7 has been treated			1
she should be on the road to recovery by now			0
' she would phone me screaming in fear , and she had a few run - ins with other patients			0
' it 's a big relief that she is finally in somewhere that can help her			2
' @entity154 , director of commissioning at the @entity32 , @entity9 and @entity156 ( @entity157 ) who are responsible for providing care for @entity7 , said they worked hard to ensure the best decisions were made			1
' in exceptional cases where a condition becomes complicated by additional diagnoses , a different type of service may be appropriate for the patient			0
' we work hard to ensure that this process is undertaken in a timely manner , however a careful balance has to be found to ensure that elements such as patient choice and clinical needs are taken into account			0
