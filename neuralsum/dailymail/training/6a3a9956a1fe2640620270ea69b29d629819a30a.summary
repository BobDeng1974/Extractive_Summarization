by @entity1 reporter last updated at 9:19 pm on 5th december 2011 it appeared to be business as usual for @entity4 today after he was spotted sharing a joke with fellow @entity7 presenter @entity6 in @entity8			1
despite the apparent banter , @entity4 , 51 , showed signs of strain as he shot the new series of @entity7 in @entity13			1
the controversial host - already under fire for suggesting public sector strikers ' be shot in front of their families ' last week - hit the headlines again over the weekend amid growing concerns about his ' vulnerable state of mind ' and the precarious state of his 18 - year marriage			1
he also provoked a fresh storm of protest after describing people who kill themselves by jumping under trains as ' selfish '			0
something funny ? it seemed to be business as usual for @entity4 , left , as he shared a joke with fellow @entity7 presenter @entity6 , right , during filming in @entity8 one senior @entity33 insider , who asked not to be named , said @entity4 was n’t in ‘ the best possible place at the moment ’ in his personal life			1
he added : ‘ there is a feeling that he ’s in a more vulnerable state than he should be and that ’s why his judgment is n’t a-grade at the moment			1
’ but there is some good news for @entity4 - despite sparking fury with his outburst , his dvd sales have soared , according to @entity49			2
the dvd titled powered up , which sees @entity4 and the @entity51 in the south of @entity53 while searching for his ' favourite car of the year ' , is set to become a @entity56 favourite			2
an @entity49 spokesperson told the @entity58 : ' we 've found in the past that controversy involving artists , with all the media coverage this generates , can boost sales of their products			0
' industry experts have suggested that the incident would boost sales up as much as 50 per cent across online and high street sales			0
strained : despite the apparent banter @entity4 , left , did show signs of strain as he waited to film the new series of @entity7 in @entity13 action : @entity4 last week jetted off to @entity8 amid a public outcry over his comments about striking public sector workers on @entity79 nine months ago , allegations surfaced that the presenter had been having a 14 - month affair with events organiser @entity83 , who works for a company which helped produce the @entity7 live show			1
two months later , the millionaire presenter was forced to deny reports he had been thrown out of the marital home in @entity89 , @entity90 , by his wife after he wrote about the delights of living in an unfurnished flat in @entity95			0
the next day , @entity4 said that he had simply been using the flat as a bolt - hole while he was filming in @entity95			2
@entity4 , who is reportedly paid £ 1million a year by the @entity33 , used his weekly column in @entity99 newspaper to expand on comments he had made about suicide , which were aired during the same edition of @entity79 last wednesday			1
at the time these were overshadowed by his joke about the strikers , which has so far attracted 31,000 complaints to the @entity33			1
but in his newspaper column @entity4 wrote that ‘ foxy woxy and the birds ’ should be left to ‘ nibble ’ at the ‘ gooey parts ’ of people who die by jumping in front of trains			1
three of the country ’s leading mental health charities said they would complain to the @entity118 about the remarks , which they said intruded on private grief and breached @entity118 guidelines which restrict what newspapers can report about suicides for fear of encouraging copycat incidents			0
@entity79 immediately issued an on - air apology for the star ’s remarks about suicide but did not address his comments about strikers			1
further outcry : however the presenter caused yet more outrage after writing about suicide in his newspaper column on saturday it was widely assumed that @entity4 had also apologised for the remarks			1
but he denied having done so in his column on saturday			2
corporation bosses had hoped the apologies would draw a line under the storm but @entity4 ’s decision to return to the subject of what he called ‘ @entity146 ’ in his newspaper column has only plunged him deeper into controversy			1
@entity148 , chief executive of mental health charity mind , said : ‘ @entity4 ’s article in @entity99 is extraordinarily tasteless and shows an utter lack of understanding of the tragedy of any suicide			2
‘ many people who have contemplated suicide seriously or lost loved ones will be shocked by his insensitive tone and needless graphic detail			0
’ under the heading ‘ think of the poor driver before your leap in front of @entity165 ’ , @entity4 said he had every sympathy with those who felt the need to take their own lives			0
controversial : @entity4 makes his headline - hitting comment on @entity33 's @entity79 but he went on to argue that suicide victims who ‘ hurled ’ themselves in front of trains were selfish and disruptive because they inconvenienced other members of the public			1
he wrote : ‘ it is a very selfish way to go because the disruption it causes is immense			0
and think of what it ’s like for the poor train driver who sees you lying on the line and can do absolutely nothing to avoid a collision			0
’ @entity4 then bemoans the fact that trains which are involved in a collision with a person must stop until the full aftermath of the incident has been dealt with and all remains have been recovered from the vicinity			0
he wrote : ‘ the train can not be moved nor the line re-opened until all of the victim ’s body has been recovered			0
marriage problems : @entity4 with his second wife , @entity201 ‘ this is the part i do n’t understand			2
it ’s not like the poor soul is going to get any better			0
‘ change the driver , pick up the big bits of what ’s left of the victim , get the train moving as soon as possible and let foxy woxy and the birds nibble away at the smaller , gooey parts that are far away or hard to find			1
’ @entity4 advises potential suicide victims to kill themselves quietly and privately			1
@entity4 's first wife : @entity215 married him in 1989 but the couple separated a year later @entity217 , the chief executive of the @entity218 , which is campaigning to reduce the number of suicides on the railway network , said the comments in the column went beyond what he had said about suicide on @entity79 and were far worse than anything he had ever said about striking public sector workers			1
she said : ‘ his notion that suicide is a selfish act shows how little he knows about the subject because , if he did , he would know that when a person attempts suicide they are so distressed that they genuinely believe their families will be better off without them			0
' the fact that he has chosen to add fuel to the flames of the comments he made on @entity79 again beggars belief			2
‘ it ’s one thing to joke about people on strike , it ’s in an entirely different realm of poor taste to joke about suicide			0
’ @entity4 ’s column also sparked an avalanche of complaints on @entity248 and other social networking sites			2
one fan tweeted : ‘ please stop			0
shooting the strikers is one thing , but this is pretty indefensible			0
’ another added : ‘ really shocked by the “ train suicide ” comments			0
’ but there were some signs of support on @entity248 and elsewhere			0
rabbi dr @entity259 , of @entity260 , said : ‘ i am totally sympathetic to the black depression that overtakes those who commit suicide , and certainly want to prevent any future ones , but @entity4 has done us a favour by saying out aloud that while people have the right to end their lives , they should not do so in a way that scars others			2
’ the @entity33 declined to comment on @entity4 ’s column in the @entity273 a @entity33 spokesman was unable to comment on anything relating to the presenter ’s private life and was unable to reach @entity4 because he was in @entity8 .			1
