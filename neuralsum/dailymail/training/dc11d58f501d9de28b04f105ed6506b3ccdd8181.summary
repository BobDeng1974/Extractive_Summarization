worried about those @entity0 presents not reaching relatives on time ? look away now			0
this is the moment a couple driving through @entity5 spotted a @entity7 van tearing down the highway with its back door open - and packages tumbling out			1
look out ! the @entity11 were forced to swerve around at least four packages falling out a @entity7 van let 's hope it 's not fragile ... boxes and letters tumbled onto the @entity5 highway just days before @entity0 concerns : the footage will no doubt alarm the millions of families who use @entity7 to deliver festive gifts the pair skirted around four presents before the driver eventually realized they were trying to flag him down			1
thankfully , he looks shocked and appears to start turning the van around to go back			0
let 's just hope there was nothing fragile among there			0
the footage will no doubt shock millions of @entity7 users , who treat the mail service as a sure - fire way to get last - minute gifts across the country - and across the globe - on time			1
there goes another : as the driver flashed his lights repeatedly , this letter flew in their direction teetering : they could see a number of packages perilously balancing on the edge of the open truck and another : this smaller package also flew out the door as the driver swung round a bend in the road flashing his lights , the driver tells viewers he has already run over four parcels when a large brown box , a smaller brown box , and a letter come flying out onto the tarmac			1
it takes more than 60 seconds for their signals to finally get recognized			0
and as they pull up beside the van , viewers get a close up view of even more packages perilously teetering on the edge			2
could have been more : as they pulled up , @entity73 viewers got a view of even more packages hanging out alarmed : the driver looked shocked and thanked the passers - by when they explained the situation			2

couple driving on @entity5 highway run over at least 3 packages
they can be seen falling from @entity7 truck in front with its door open
after more than 1 minute of flashing their lights , they confront the driver
