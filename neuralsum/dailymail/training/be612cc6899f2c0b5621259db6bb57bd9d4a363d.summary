even by the @entity3 's barbaric standards , the terror group 's latest execution video has reached a truly depraved new low			2
the footage shows @entity8 pilot @entity6 being burnt alive in scenes that are far too shocking to even consider publishing			1
as with previous beheading videos featuring @entity13 executioner @entity12 , the 20 - minute - long clip is characterised by its slick production values and graphics			1
but unlike the others , it contains an added cinematic dimension designed to achieve unparalleled impact on the viewer - as if the horror of watching someone torched to death was n't enough			1
@entity25 blames the @entity27 fighter pilot for burning houses - and killing babies - with airstrikes before he was captured in december			1
the manner of his death is a symbolic show of strength to strike terror into ' non-believers ' and encourage recruits or doubters within their ranks in equal measure			0
' the global public got more or less used to it			0
@entity25 shows innovation in finding new means of psychological warfare or terrorism			2
' considering the @entity8 public 's emotional involvement in this case , this is not just a cruel execution , but an act of terror that is going to hit right into the hearts and minds of the @entity8 people			0
' the helplessness of the victim , the viciousness and thought with which the fire was arranged make the video unwatchable			0
' it is similar to the first time the world saw beheadings			0
it is psychological shock and awe delivered through the power of imagery			0
' it 's like a sickening game show			0
everything is so pre-arranged and planned - just the contestant has no chance to escape			0
it is a new level of terror			0
' the title of the video - healing the @entity98 - is also revealing			1
it is thought to refer to ' giving them pleasure ' - an obvious statement of revenge			2
barbaric : an @entity25 extremist lights a trail of petrol leading to the cage in which the 26 - year - old stands depraved : the flames reach the cage holding the helpless pilot			1
it is later flattened by a bulldozer whereas the @entity12 videos were often static - showing the executioner standing behind his victims - this video features a slick combination of aerial shots , panoramic views and changing camera angles that would have taken far longer to edit			1
reports coming out from @entity8 suggest @entity123 may have died as long ago as january 3 , suggesting the finished video has been a month in the planning			0
the new video also contains far more of the landscape than has previously been shown that intelligence experts will be frantically analysing for clues to the whereabouts of the jihadists			0
the video , which is @entity25 ' most sickening yet , begins with a lengthy montage showing @entity8 's @entity134 declaring his support for the @entity137 coalition in the style of a tv news report			1
militants fighting for the @entity3 in @entity141 and @entity142 have released a video they claim shows @entity8 pilot @entity6 being burned alive while locked in a cage brutal : the footage , which is titled ' healing the @entity147 ' appears to show the captured airman wearing an orange jumpsuit as a trail of petrol leading up to the cage is seen being set alight captured : @entity152 ( centre in white ) was captured by the @entity3 after after crashing near its hq in the @entity141 city of @entity157 in december			1
@entity25 is now believed to brutally murdered him it then cuts to beaten and bruised - looking @entity44 sitting in a darkened room wearing an orange jump suit and giving details of his training as a pilot , the @entity137 airstrikes he took part in , and details of the crash in which his f - 16 jet came down in jihadi - held territory			1
his commentary is preceded and interspersed by slick graphics including one showing an f - 16 fight jet being smashed into tiny pieces			2
another segue features a crying baby over images of infants @entity25 claims were injured and killed in airstrikes by @entity8			1
@entity44 is then paraded in front of heavily armed men wearing combat fatigues and yellow masks			0
the pilot 's face looks swollen , heavily bruised and bloody in places - no doubt from repeat beatings by the terrorists from the moment of his capture			2
@entity195 is later seen walking towards the cage in which he would be burnt alive			1
whereas the @entity12 videos were often static - showing the executioner standing behind his victims - the latest video features a slick combination of aerial shots , panoramic views and changing camera angles it then switches to an aerial shot showing the captured airman wearing an orange jumpsuit as a trail of petrol leading up to the cage is seen being set alight			1
the enormous flames quickly engulf the pilot , who is seen battling them for more than a minute before falling to his knees and putting up no further resistance			2
he remains alive for at least another 30 seconds , however , before falling backwards on to the floor of the cage			0
the images are far too distressing to publish			0
the @entity221 extremist group had threatened to kill @entity44 unless @entity8 handed over a jailed @entity142 female suicide bomber , but the deal collapsed			0
the release of the video of the pilot 's purported murder came days after @entity25 beheaded a second @entity229 hostage within a week			1
@entity25 had vowed to kill the second @entity229 man , @entity231 , and @entity44 by sunset on january 29 unless @entity233 handed over @entity142 jihadist and would - be suicide bomber @entity235 , who is on death row in @entity8 .			2

20 - minute clip contains cinematic dimension never before seen from @entity25
video features @entity243 - style graphics , sound editing and camera angles
titled healing the @entity247 - said to mean ' giving them pleasure '
@entity25 considers pilot *responsible* for burning babies in airstrikes in @entity141
now they have burnt him alive in scenes that are too shocking to show
