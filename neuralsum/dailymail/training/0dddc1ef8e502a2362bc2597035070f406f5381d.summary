by @entity0 published : 16:30 est , 26 june 2012 updated : 05:22 est , 27 june 2012 @entity1 has found himself at the centre of yet another race row after a leading @entity5 newspaper published a deeply offensive cartoon of him as @entity7			1
@entity8 likened the star striker to the mythical monster with an image of him swatting away footballs in the same way @entity7 did aircrafts atop @entity16 's @entity15			1
the @entity1 camp was understood to be outraged by the cartoon and @entity8 have issued an apology			1
unfunny : @entity1 was personified as @entity7 in the offensive @entity8 cartoon force : @entity5 striker @entity1 controlling the ball against @entity23 ( left ) and receiving a yellow card against @entity26 and @entity25 ( right ) ‘ it was n’t our cartoonist ’s best product			1
in these times we need a bit more moderation , caution and good taste			1
' but we have always fought against racism and condemned booing against @entity1 as unacceptable , ’ said the @entity38 - based newspaper			1
a spokesman for the anti-racism organisation @entity39 said : ‘ @entity1 is such an important person in @entity5 football			1
' aspiring players in @entity5 who want to follow in his footsteps could wonder what support they will have when they get to his level when they see cartoons like that			1
‘ it is not the first time we have seen this sort of depiction of @entity1 and we think the media have a responsibility			1
how do they think they can portray him like that ? ’ journalists in @entity5 were horrified with @entity60 saying : ‘ it 's an unfortunate cartoon			1
it 's hard to defend the right of satire against censorship in this case			1
i would never have allowed it			1
' disgusting : an @entity5 councillor mocked up this picture of @entity1 and posted it on his @entity71 page anger : @entity73 , 51 , of the right wing @entity74 , mocked up the photograph which showed @entity1 , 21 , wearing his @entity5 shirt and bent over collecting cabbages in a field last week an @entity5 regional councillor sparked outrage after he posted on his @entity71 page a picture of @entity1 working in fields as an immigrant worker			1
@entity73 , 51 , of the right wing @entity74 , mocked up the photograph which showed @entity1 wearing his @entity5 shirt and bent over collecting cabbages in a field			1
the caption underneath referred to @entity1 's elbow against @entity92 's @entity91 in his side 's 2 - 0 win which went unseen by the match referee , the player 's goal and then his foul mouthed outburst			1
@entity73 wrote : ' he comes commits a foul worthy of a red card , scores then unleashes a verbal onslaught against the bench forcing them to shut him up			2
' this clown should go and work in the fields			2
' in @entity5 it is not uncommon to see immigrants from @entity110 or @entity111 working in fields collecting vegetables in searing heat			2
there have been numerous complaints over conditions they have to endure			2
@entity73 's comments immediately provoked controversy with many accusing him of blatant racism			2
and it came after @entity123 launched an investigation against @entity126 fans after they threw bananas at @entity1 and aimed monkey chants at him			1
time to focus : @entity1 and @entity5 will take on @entity129 in the @entity131 semi-final verbal : @entity5 's @entity1 is hushed up by team - mates @entity132 , @entity134 and @entity135 after he scored his goal against @entity23 before the tournament started @entity139 striker @entity1 , who was born in @entity5 to @entity141 immigrant parents , had vowed to walk off if he was racially abused			1
so far he has stayed on the pitch			2
@entity73 , based in @entity143 in north east @entity5 , an area well known for its nationalism , immediately hit back at claims he was being racist and at those who had attacked him via @entity71			2
he posted a picture of himself at a council meeting with a black resident adding : ' how can they accuse me of racism			2
i work with non @entity154 nationals			2
' this is the best response to this presumed racism			2
' married @entity73 added : ' what i was doing was making a footballing comment , i was highlighting how @entity1 had committed a bad foul which could have got him sent off			1
@entity1 is now preparing for tomorrow 's semi-final against @entity129 in @entity161			1
different approach : @entity1 ( left ) relaxes as his teammates go through a punishing training session on tuesday @entity123 also opened disciplinary proceedings against the @entity166 and the @entity167 for alleged racist behaviour and chanting by fans			1
@entity26 football ’s governing body fined the @entity172 € 30,000 after supporters threw fireworks and displayed ‘ inappropriate and racist banners ’ during a match against @entity176			0
it was @entity172 ’s second racism - related sanction of the tournament			0
in @entity183 the focus for the @entity5 remained on trying to do to @entity129 what they did to @entity186 on sunday night in @entity187			0
@entity188 , the architect of @entity186 ’s destruction , appeared before the media and had few words of encouragement for @entity194 ’s beaten quarter - finalists			0
‘ our approach to the game against @entity129 will be the same as against @entity186 , ’ he said			0
‘ this is because it is the only way we can play			0
we have to take advantage of our quality , our technique			0
charged : meanwhile , @entity123 have opened disciplinary proceedings against @entity207 @entity206 @entity205 's over the behaviour of their fans ' but , unlike @entity186 , @entity129 can create many threats to our defence			0
‘ @entity186 played a very prudent and careful way			0
they were sitting back all match , like @entity214 did in the @entity216 final			0
they tried to keep that same shape			0
' for them , going to the penalty shootout was already a good result			0
’ @entity188 said his stunning chip penalty was a key moment in the game because it was a huge psychological blow to @entity186			0
‘ i did n’t celebrate the penalty because at that point there was nothing to celebrate , ’ he said			0
‘ but it was really relevant to the match and our win			0
this changed the course of the match			0
' for me , @entity235 seemed to be very confident in himself and it seemed to be a psychological blow			0
i needed to do something to beat him			0
penalties are a very personal thing			0
‘ when you have to shoot a penalty you have to be confident in yourself			0
