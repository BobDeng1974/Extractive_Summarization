by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 after the soaring temperatures of @entity6 some @entity4 fans are sure to return home with red faces but @entity9 was on hand to ensure that at least there was no embarrassment to accompany the sunburn			1
spurs were within 16 minutes of being the first @entity15 team to lose to @entity6 opponents in competition and the locals inside the @entity19 were giddy at the prospect of making history in the first leg of this @entity24 play - off			1
the game changed , however , within minutes of @entity9 ’s introduction , as he opened spaces and supplied the passes for @entity30 and @entity31 to score the goals to send @entity34 ’s team home with a 2 - 1 lead			1
for @entity30 , his ferocious strike must have been like a shot of pain relief			1

man of the match : @entity9			0
until then , it had been another miserable experience for him as he missed an early sitter and collected a booking for a desperate lunging foul committed after an inexcusably poor touch			0
for @entity31 , the winner was just reward for his bustling performance , when for long periods he seemed like the only player with the desire to haul @entity4 out of trouble after @entity47 had put @entity43 ahead in the first half			1
but much credit goes to @entity9 , a 72nd - minute substitute , who is showing signs that under the guidance of fellow @entity108 , @entity4 may begin see what all the fuss and money was about			1
‘ it is never easy in the first season for a player from another country , ’ said @entity34			0
‘ it ’s true it was difficult for him			0
he was injured , too			0
he was very disappointed about last season but the past is the past			0
‘ we are confident that with time and hard work , like he has done in pre-season , he can go far			2
we need him to look forward , believe in his skill and work very hard			2
’ until @entity9 ’s arrival , @entity4 had been hugely underwhelming			2
they were sluggish and sloppy in the stifling heat and on a terrible pitch , which was slow , spongy and cut up quickly			0
@entity43 were having no such problems and were playing fluently by the time @entity47 put them ahead in the 14th minute			2
the goal was a simple affair , the result of an awful sequence from @entity4 , when @entity137 and @entity76 were both careless in possession , deep in defence			1
@entity47 seized the ball , drove towards goal and beat @entity70 as he careered out			1
@entity34 looked unimpressed and accused his team of being complacent and failing to heed his pre-match warnings			0
‘ we knew they had a good team but i think it ’s true that we believed it would be an easy game , ’ said the @entity4 boss			2
‘ we struggled in the first half			2
we started well but then made some mistakes and they came into the game			2
‘ it was a very tough game in difficult conditions			0
we started to play in the second half			0
in general , i am happy and in the end it is an important result for us			0
’ enduring the heat : @entity4 fans watch on as their side struggles in the first half , but they will return to @entity161 happy after a second - half turnaround shut down : @entity30 struggled in the first half as @entity43 denied him time on the ball , but the @entity65 striker responded with a goal with 15 minutes to play advantage : @entity78 battles with @entity167 as @entity4 battle to turn the tie around delight : @entity9 , who came on as a substitute moments before @entity4 began their comeback , celebrates the first goal with scorer @entity30 perhaps it would have all been a little easier had @entity30 scored in the fifth minute , when @entity175 spilled a shot from @entity31 at his feet			1
@entity30 could not adjust his feet in time and the ball squirted wide from his left boot			2
most of @entity4 ’s best moments in the first - half revolved around @entity31 who displayed energy and positive intent , even if his final delivery was inconsistent			1
twice the young striker was denied from distance by @entity43 ’s @entity191 goalkeeper			0
@entity34 ’s three second - half substitutions lifted the team and his strikers combined well when @entity30 nodded a cross from @entity196 to @entity31 , who caught it crisply on the half - volley			1
@entity50 beat the effort down into the ground only for it to spring up behind the keeper , hit the bar and fly out			0
@entity31 held his head , fearing it was one of those days , but @entity43 were wilting and @entity30 soon levelled			1
@entity9 slid a pass into his feet , although it was not an easy chance			0
but the £ 28million record signing gathered the ball from the £ 30m record signing and lashed it in from an angle			0
six minutes later , @entity9 came alive again , this time producing a smart reverse pass to release @entity31 , who took a touch , wriggled clear of a defender and drove the ball high into the top corner			1
@entity9 almost added a wonderful third with an intricate dribble from the left and a low shot which flashed narrowly wide			0
despite the scare , @entity4 had seized control and will surely confirm their place in the group stages next week			2
pointing the way : @entity4 goalscorers @entity30 and @entity31 celebrate the first of their two goals in @entity228 as @entity4 make @entity24 qualification likely taking the lead : @entity15 striker @entity31 celebrates putting his side ahead ten minutes from time			1

@entity4 fall behind to @entity47 goal on 14 minutes
@entity30 and @entity31 respond with goals in six second - half minutes to turn the tie around
spurs made to work hard but now in a strong position to qualify for @entity24
