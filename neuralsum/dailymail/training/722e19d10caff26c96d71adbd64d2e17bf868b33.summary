retailer @entity0 has refused to help a campaign to save orphaned penguins , despite their successful @entity5 advert being based on the animals			1
earlier this month , @entity8 launched an appeal to raise £ 20,000 for their centre in @entity12 to help care for the chicks , which had been abandoned by their parents			1
the centre had come under increasing financial pressure due to the number of young penguins having to be cared for and the rise in fish prices			0
it tells the story of a young boy who realises his lonely @entity48 penguin , @entity33 , is longing for a penguin companion			1
and so on christmas morning , the boy surprises @entity33 with the gift of a new penguin friend named @entity52			0
but despite @entity0 wishing them luck , they said they were unable to help with their campaign as they had already partnered with wildlife conservation charity @entity60 to support and help protect the habitat of the @entity48 penguin			1
a spokeswoman for the zoo said : ' as a wildlife conservation charity , we decided to launch a public appeal for starving penguin chicks in @entity12			1
' in view of the enormous impact of their @entity5 penguin advert , we approached @entity0 to ask them to support our project in the wild ; either through helping us to spread the word via their online channels or through financial support			1
' we were disappointed to learn that they felt they could n't contribute neither to help save these endangered creatures			0
the charity had asked @entity0 if they would help out with their appeal but the retailer said they were unable to help two of the orphaned penguins , who were abandoned and then rescued by a project led by @entity8			1
the charity is hoping to raise £ 20,000 to help care for them @entity8 say they were disappointed that @entity0 felt they could n't help their appeal for the penguins ' however , we are delighted that many members of the public are supporting this appeal , and remain hopeful that the generosity of the human spirit ensures that the chicks do n't go hungry this @entity5			1
' a spokeswoman for @entity0 explained that they receive many enquiries asking them to support charitable causes and it is unfortunate they can not fulfil every request			2
she said : ' we receive a high number of charitable requests throughout the year and we are unfortunately unable to support all of these			0
' this year for our @entity5 advertising campaign we have partnered with @entity60 and all profit from the cd sales of the @entity5 advert single , @entity110 , is going towards their adopt a @entity117 programme			1
' since the campaign launched on november 6 , along with @entity60 ’s own penguin adoption @entity5 activity , @entity60 has sent out over 2,000 adoptions for @entity48 penguins , an increase of over 600 per cent from this time last year			1
' we passed our apologies to @entity125 that we are unable to help on this occasion and wish them the best of luck with their campaign			2
' @entity8 set up and runs the charity @entity131 , which takes in @entity12 penguin chicks , which have been abandoned by the parents			2
more than 430 @entity12 penguins are being cared for by the charity after being abandoned by their parents one of the @entity12 penguins is weighed by the staff at the centre in @entity12			2
there are now fewer than 18,000 breeding pairs left in the wild off the coast of @entity12 and @entity145 the bird 's population fell by 70 per cent between 2001 and 2013 and there are fewer than 18,000 breeding pairs left in the wild off the @entity12 and @entity145 coast			0
the charity says that this year , the chicks are coming in early and in their hundreds from the colonies and that they are already helping to care for more than 430 birds			0
staff at the society said the price of fish has sky - rocketed this season and an extra £ 20,000 is needed before @entity5 or they will have to stop taking in animals			2
dr @entity164 , director of conservation at @entity8 said : ' unless conservation organisations intervene , these chicks will starve to death			0
' as african penguin populations are currently facing a crisis due to a diminished food supply near their nesting colonies , there is a substantial risk that this species could eventually become extinct without action			0
' numerous penguin chicks are abandoned around this time of year , just before their parents start their moulting cycle , when they develop a new set of waterproof feathers			0
adult @entity12 penguins still need to make foraging trips during this time and leave their chicks behind .			0

@entity125 has launched a campaign to help save abandoned penguins
started appeal to raise £ 20,000 for 430 penguins in centre in @entity12
zoo decided to approach @entity0 to ask for their help with the project
comes after the retailer features a lonely penguin in its @entity5 advert
but firm said they were unable to help as they already support the @entity60
say profit from cds of advert 's *music* are going to help the @entity48 penguin
