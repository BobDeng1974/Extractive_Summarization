by @entity0 published : 16:12 est , 4 november 2013 updated : 09:23 est , 5 november 2013 zoos around the @entity2 soon find out whether a beagle named @entity4 can let them know when their polar bears are pregnant			1
the two - year - old dog has been specially trained for a year by a @entity8 handler who has taught canines to sniff out everything from explosives to bed bugs			1
a @entity14 animal conservation scientist had the idea after reading about studies on using dogs to detect cancer			0
they separate them from males , get them into dens with extra bedding , step up video - camera monitoring , and line up staff and volunteers for 24 - hour ' cub watches ' later			0
' it 's always nice to know in advance , ' said @entity44 of the @entity45 , who coordinates polar bear species survival planning for the @entity48			0
she praised the beagle project as ' thinking outside the box ' to provide a potentially important new tool			0
diagram showing how the process was discovered and how @entity4 was trained in the job it 's non-invasive and simple for zookeepers , who pick up fecal samples for @entity4 to check out			2
' we did n't even know if this was possible , ' said @entity60 , a former police officer who runs @entity61 in @entity22 , @entity8 he was intrigued when @entity62 , a post-doctoral fellow at the @entity14 's @entity63 , reached out for someone willing to test the idea after the center identified proteins present only in pregnant bears ' samples			2
@entity60 started with samples of bears that had already delivered babies , and from some known not to be pregnant because they had n't mated			0
he also tried training a border collie for the bear pregnancy test but soon determined that @entity4 , a former @entity76 rabbit hunter , was more adept			2
polar bear protein samples await testing by @entity4 , a beagle at @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity8 ' he was very methodical , ' @entity60 said			1
' you could tell he was really running it through the think tank			0
' rewarded with food and getting to play with his favorite squeaky duck toy , @entity4 trained for months and was alerting to samples of previously pregnant bears with near - perfect accuracy before @entity62 drove out a cooler full of current samples last week			1
she watched as @entity4 reacted to a control sample of a bear that had already delivered			2
' he sat right down			0
i thought , ' whew , this works ! '' @entity62 said			0
@entity4 has been checking out samples of 22 female bears from 14 zoos , while @entity95 logs his reactions			1
when @entity4 is done , which could be in a matter of days , @entity62 will inform the other zoos whether @entity4 predicts they 'll be hearing the pitter - patter of little paws later this year			1
@entity4 enjoys a moment with @entity62 at @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity8 - @entity62 reached out for someone willing to test the idea of dogs sniffing out the pregnant bear samples @entity44 , whose @entity45 produced two of the only three cubs that were born in @entity2 zoos last year , recommends that zoos continue monitoring and have female bears go into dens if they have mated , even if @entity4 ' new sniff test indicates they are n't pregnant			1
polar bears have complicated reproductive cycles , and zoos have found that false pregnancies are common			1
better results from captive breeding of polar bears can help zoo scientists learn more about their reproduction and also help public awareness			1
with the long - term survival of polar bears believed to be under threat by climate change impacts on icy habitats , species advocates such as @entity125 say zoo bears can play important roles			2
' they serve as ambassadors for their species , and there are studies that can be done in zoos that would be impossible in the wild , ' spokeswoman @entity132 said			0
baby polar bear cubs @entity141 and @entity142 , born in november , 2012 , are seen at the zoo in @entity45 , @entity144			0

beagle named @entity4 will soon visit zoos around the @entity2 to test their polar bears
