by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 07:33 est , 31 october 2013 updated : 09:09 est , 31 october 2013 if you have ever missed the perfect moment to take a picture , then @entity3 researchers could have the answer - a camera that automatically captures whatever you find interesting			1
the prototype headset , called a @entity9 , combines a brainwave scanner with an @entity12 dock			2
this allows it to see what the wearer sees , while a brainwave quantifying algorithm developed by @entity18 , @entity3 , monitors the user 's level of interest through a special headband the phone is attached to			1
here , the user seems be be moderately interested in a road , but her interest score is not high enough to record a video clip of the location it can constantly judge whether they are interested in what they are looking at on a scale of one to 100			1
if the individual scores over 60 , the device records a five - second film on their @entity12 in a special ‘ liveblogging ’ app , which can then be used to remember what they have seen and liked during the day			0
the prototype headset , called a @entity9 , combines a brainwave scanner with an @entity12 dock the @entity9 wearable camera system claims to detect a wearer 's emotions			1
it automatically records moments of interest based on an analysis of the user 's brainwaves			1
the system uses an analytics algorithm based on the sensitivity values of ' interest ' and ' like '			1
a user 's interests are quantified on a range of 0 to 100			2
the smartphone camera is triggered to automatically record and save 5 second @entity70 clips of scenes when the interest value exceeds 60			1
the scene is saved together with time stamp and location so it can be replayed			0
' this is an extraordinary experiment that challenges the way future cameras can evolve and how humans may interact with such devices , ' the firm behind the camera claims			0
' the @entity9 allows humans emotions to become integrated with devices , and we see this as a totally new experience			0
' we believe that in the future , home electronics , facilities , services will seamlessly merge " thought " and " emotions " with the human body as an emotional interface , such as what the @entity9 sets out to achieve			0
' the firm , @entity25 , admits the current prototype , which straps an iphone to a user ’s head , is a little bulky and says it is hopeful it can develop a smaller , more fashionable version			0
it is also considering the addition of a manual mode to enable emotion tagging to scenes , just like gps information or time stamps that are tagged to photos			0
an extra ' effect function ' would also automatically overlay filters and visual effects on clips based on emotions , if the prototype is developed			2
' we also see potential usage cases for city planning , store development and are exploring other possibilities , ' the company said			0
the device uses a brainwave quantifying algorithm to monitor the wearer 's level of interest through a special headband the phone is attached to			1
it judges what the person if interested in on a scale of 1 - 100 and records a 5 - second video clip if the user scores over 60 ( pictured ) @entity25 is thinking of adding an extra ' effect function ' to its device ( pictured ) , which would automatically overlay filters and visual effects on video clips based on emotions			2

the @entity9 claims to rate a user 's level of interest in what they are looking at and measures it on a scale of one to 100
it uses an analytics algorithm that looks at what a wearer ' likes ' , which was developed by @entity152 of @entity18 , @entity3
the smartphone camera is triggered to automatically record and save five second @entity70 clips of scenes that are shown to be of interest to the wearer
