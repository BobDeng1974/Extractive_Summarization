the 26 - year - old was warned she would never compete again but she has stunned doctors with her enthusiastic return to sport			1
@entity5 suffered a broken back , broken leg and head injury in a car crash which was caused by car thieves involved in a police chase ms @entity5 said : ‘ doctors told me i should never race again because of knee ligament damage sustained in the crash but i did n't want to let two people driving like idiots ruin my life			1
‘ i am the kind of person who , as soon as someone tells me i ca n't do something , i am determined that i will do it			0
‘ i proved a point to myself , i would hope that it shows other people that sometimes really bad things happen but it should never change your aims , ambitions and dreams			0
’ ms @entity5 , of @entity45 , @entity46 , who accepts that doctors would not encourage her involvement in triathlons , admitted the past year had been an emotional rollercoaster			1
she said : ‘ i ca n't believe it has been a year - i spent six months lying on a sofa and six months trying to live the life i missed out on , i suppose			1
‘ when i returned for my first triathlon , my only aim was to compete so when i won , it was an amazing feeling			2
‘ it made all the hard work and determination worth it			0
’ ms @entity5 was nearly killed when she became the innocent victim of a high - speed police chase which had started in @entity62			1
before the crash , she took part in triathlons and other adventure races			1
she was told she would n't be able to compete again as a result of her injuries after the crash , ms @entity5 set herself the goal of returning to competitive sport before her 26th birthday - an aim which she achieved with just days to spare			1
she is pictured running just before the crash @entity72 , 20 , from @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 , 21 , from @entity76 , @entity74 , lost control of their @entity78 on the @entity80 in @entity81 , @entity46 , after the 100mph pursuit			2
the chase had crossed two counties before the pair 's vehicle collided with a blue beetle which then smashed into ms @entity5 ’s tiny hatchback sending her head - on into a pursuing police car			1
however , she was determined to return to competition before her 26th birthday - and she managed the feat with two days to spare			2
she took part in a ‘ tri-adventure ’ which saw her endure two hours of running , cycling and orienteering in @entity96			2
recovering : ms @entity5 's tiny hatchback car was sent head - on into a police car during the car chase			1
she was left fighting for her life she went on to win the first triathlon she took part in after returning to competitive sport her next challenge is competing in a gruelling ironman event in @entity107 in june to raise funds for the @entity109 who airlifted her to hospital following the accident			1
the gruelling @entity113 to @entity115 event involves a 2.4 - mile swim in @entity117 , a 112 - mile bike ride and then 26.2 - mile off - road marathon to the summit of @entity121			2
she said : ‘ i booked myself on to that race when i was lying in a back brace on my sofa			2
‘ it was my ambition - i knew i was going to get better if i kept my focus on doing that race - i had something to strive for			2
‘ to have come through something so horrific just showed me that i am quite strong and capable of a lot , more than i thought i was			0
’ as a result of her injuries , for months ms @entity5 could only stand with the help of a back brace judge @entity135 made headlines in august last year as he bemoaned sentencing guidelines which only allowed him to sentence the pair to 18 months and 16 months imprisonment , respectively , for aggravated vehicle taking			1
he stunned onlookers at @entity142 saying : ‘ you will get out of prison and will get your life back but @entity5 will never get over this , physically or mentally			1
‘ it is absurd - if i just pass sentence and allow credit for your guilty pleas , because i have to - it will not be enough			0
i am stuck with it because of what the law says and i ca n't abide it			0
’ however , ms @entity5 has not let the justice system soften her resolve despite the pair being released earlier this year after serving just half of their sentence			1
the @entity165 ’s product manager said : ‘ that 's the criminal justice system for you			0
' having regained her fitness , she now plans to raise money for the @entity109 which airlifted her to hospital after the crash she admitted crying every day following the accident after being told she may never compete in competitive sport again			1
at first she could not feed herself and could stand up for less than a minute at a time without the help of a back brace			0
but now she has moved into her own flat and she continues to rebuild her life			0
she said : ‘ the last 12 months has been a real emotional journey			0
my lowest point was when my leg cast came off and i could n't bend my knee at all			0
‘ there were a lot of points where i thought i would be like this forever			0
it was horrendous but i just kept pushing myself a little further every day			0
‘ i have been pretty much working , training at the gym and racing			0
‘ they [ the thieves ] have got over it , but i want to show them that what they did could not destroy my life			0
‘ it was really upsetting to see that they were both released , but fingers crossed they have both learned their lesson and they wo n't hurt anyone else			0
‘ i would n't wish what happened to me on my worst enemy			0
