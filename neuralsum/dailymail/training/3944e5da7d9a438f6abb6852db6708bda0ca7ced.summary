@entity0 , one of hundreds of @entity1 who have been among the toughest jihadi fighters in @entity4 , has emerged as the face of the @entity6 , appearing frequently in its online videos			1
his appearances in the videos are in contrast to the group 's @entity21 leader , @entity20 , who remains deep in hiding and has hardly ever been photographed			1
@entity23 has been the group 's military commander in @entity4 , leading it on an offensive to take over a broad stretch of territory leading to the @entity21 border			1
but he may have risen to become the group 's overall military chief , a post that has been vacant after the @entity21 militant who once held it - known as @entity34 - was killed in the @entity21 city of @entity36 in early june			1
in a video released by the group over the weekend , @entity0 is shown standing next to the group 's spokesman among a group of fighters as they declare the elimination of the border between @entity21 and @entity4			1

' our aim is clear and everyone knows why we are fighting			0
our path is toward the caliphate , ' the 28 - year - old @entity0 declares			0
' we will bring back the caliphate , and if @entity54 does not make it our fate to restore the caliphate , then we ask him to grant us martyrdom			0
' the video is consistent with other @entity59 reporting on @entity0			0
the video identified @entity0 as ' the military commander ' without specifying its @entity4 branch , suggesting he had been elevated to overall commander			1
the group however has not formally announced such a promotion			2
in a video released by the group over the weekend , @entity0 is shown standing next to the group 's spokesman among a group of fighters as they declare the elimination of the border between @entity21 and @entity4 @entity23 , whose real name is @entity75 , is an ethnic @entity1 from the @entity77 nation of @entity78 @entity80 , visiting fellow with the @entity82 , told @entity59 that as the militant group 's operations in @entity21 and @entity4 grow ' more and more inter-dependent by the day , it is more than possible that someone like ( @entity0 ) could assume overall military leadership			1

in the audio , posted yesterday on militant websites which have been used by the group before , the leader makes a special call to those with practical skills - such as scholars , judges , doctors , engineers and people with military and administrative expertise - to come ' answer the dire need of the @entity94 for them '			2
he also calls on jihadi fighters to increase fighting in the holy month of @entity114 , which began on sunday			0
he said : ' in this virtuous month or in any other month , there is no deed better than jihad in the path of @entity119 , so take advantage of this opportunity and walk the path of you righteous predecessors			0
' so to arms , to arms , soldiers of the @entity6 , fight , fight			2
' the extremist group began as @entity130 's branch in @entity21 , and many of its top leaders are @entity21			1

the two branches are now swapping fighters , equipment and weapons to an even greater extent than before , becoming a more integrated organization			0
its declaration of the caliphate - aspiring to be a state for all @entity94 - could mean an even greater internationalization of its ranks			0
@entity154 , an expert with the @entity157 's @entity156 office , said ethnicity is not a major factor in jihadi movements , only dedication to jihad			2
@entity23 ' is a fanatic of @entity94 with war experience , and he obviously has had a strong track record ( among fellow fighters ) , ' he said			0

the @entity6 entered the @entity4 conflict in 2013 , and initially it was welcomed by other rebels			1
but rebel groups - including other @entity6 militant factions - turned against it , alienated by its brutal methods and kidnappings and killings of rivals , and accusing it of trying to take over the opposition movement for its own ambitions of creating a transnational @entity6 enclave			2
