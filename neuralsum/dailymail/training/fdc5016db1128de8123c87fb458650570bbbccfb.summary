but he now has to pay 50,000 euros ( £ 40,740 ) bail to get back to the @entity1 before a @entity4 court hearing on may 15 in @entity51			1
the @entity52 was deployed to protect @entity1 fishermen during the @entity54 with @entity55 in the 1970s			0
in 1972 , @entity55 had declared an @entity56 beyond its own territorial waters while announcing plans to reduce over-fishing			1
this led to the @entity61 cutting the nets of @entity1 trawlers that fished in the area			0
the @entity1 retaliated by deploying @entity52 warships to protect @entity1 fishing crews			0
there followed a number of stand - offs between @entity1 and @entity55 vessels , which included them ramming each other			0

the @entity1 insisted they had been fishing legally in international waters , while the @entity4 say they were encroaching into their own waters , while also ruining efforts to preserve stocks			1
mr @entity29 and his crew then vowed not to be ‘ intimated ’ by threats of a 250 - boat @entity4 armada blocking their passage through the @entity119			1
today @entity120 , head of the @entity12 fisherman ’s organisation , @entity121 , appealed for calm			0
mr @entity120 said : ‘ if this boat was stopped then perhaps it had entered the 12 - mile zone where the numbers of scallops are perhaps higher			0
