children who are obese are up to six times more at risk of high blood pressure – an adult condition commonly linked to heart disease , warn specialists			1
young obese girls have the biggest problem , with a 5.9-fold chance of developing it compared with those of healthy weight , while the risk is four times greater for obese boys			1
the study from @entity16 also shows that children and teenagers who are overweight are more likely to have high blood pressure readings			0
the study from @entity16 also shows that children and teenagers who are overweight are more likely to have high blood pressure readings ( file photos ) experts say the findings are ‘ alarming ’ , given that one in three children is overweight and obese by the time they leave primary school in the @entity29			1
they come as doctors called for the creation of an emergency taskforce to tackle ‘ the rising epidemic ’ of childhood obesity , similar to the government ’s @entity36 panel which deals with terrorism and national disasters			2
the professional body representing @entity41 has warned that an entire generation will be ‘ destroyed ’ by a diet of junk food and sugary drinks unless urgent action is taken			1
in an open letter to the chief medical officer for @entity50 , professor dame @entity51 , the @entity52 ( @entity52 ) and 11 linked organisations said a national @entity53 ( @entity53 ) should be formed as ‘ a matter of urgency ’			2
doctors , nurses , midwives , dieticians , dentists and schools would collaborate to try to prevent obesity and improve treatment services to stop children developing health problems in later life			0
dr @entity67 , @entity52 clinical lead for cancer , said : ‘ for the first time , we have a generation of patients who may predecease their parents			1
only three per cent of the public associate weight with cancer , yet , after smoking , obesity is the biggest reversible factor in cancers			0
’ @entity80 evidence of the link between body fat and ill - health , even in young children , was released yesterday ( sun ) by researchers running a @entity87 in @entity88 , @entity16			1
it included 22,051 children and adolescents aged three to 18 years from ‘ health - conscious ’ families whose blood pressure , body mass index ( @entity94 ) , waist circumference and body fat percentage was measured			1
they found that compared with normal weight children and adolescents , the risk of prehypertension ( which precedes a condition needing medical treatment ) was significantly higher in youngsters with high @entity94 scores			0
the prevalence of high blood pressure increased in boys and girls as body weight went up , based on averages among the groups at the age of seven years and again at 14 years			2
hypertension in normal weight boys was 5.7 per cent , rising to 10.4 per cent for the overweight and 18.6 per cent in obese boys			0
the researchers found the prevalence of hypertension was highest in obese girls at 24.4 per cent , and 9 per cent in the overweight compared with five per cent in those of normal weight			1
prof @entity123 said ‘ the risk of having hypertension is 5.9 time higher for an obese girls and 4.3 times higher for an obese boy than for normal - weight young people			1
’ he released the data yesterday ( sun ) at the @entity132 ( @entity132 ) meeting in @entity134			0
hypertension was a blood pressure reading over the 95th percentile of the blood pressure curve for children and adolescents			0
the diagnosis was based on several measurements on separate days and on repeated estimations with the child sitting quietly for five minutes			0
professor @entity145 , professor of paediatrics at the @entity147 , @entity148 , told the meeting : ‘ blood pressure in children increases with age and body size			1
‘ this makes it impossible to use a single blood pressure level to define hypertension , as we do in adults			0
’ professor @entity123 said ‘ our study clearly shows that the fatter young people are , the greater their risk of prehypertension and hypertension			1
any weight loss they can achieve will help reduce their risk			0
‘ this is of great importance because of the ongoing rise in the prevalence of hypertension and overweight / obesity in young people and the tracking of childhood overweight into adulthood			2
’ @entity177 , from the @entity29 ’s @entity178 , said ‘ it ’s alarming			1
this demonstrates that obesity is no longer a timebomb ; it is a crisis which is escalating every day			0
‘ we need to stop children getting fat in the first place , because fat children become fat adults and as this study shows , even before then they are suffering from major health risks			0
‘ when it comes to high blood pressure , which vastly increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes , it is likely that the foods being eaten by obese children are not helping ; crisps piled high in salt , and so forth			1
‘ this has to be wake - up call			0
we are looking at a situation in which children are buried before their parents , the obesity crisis in @entity29 is horrifying			2
’ professor @entity206 , head of the @entity132 ’s preventive health group , said doctors were ‘ definitely not ’ advocating that blood pressure drugs be given to children			2
he said there was evidence that losing weight could reverse high blood pressure and it was vital that parents and schools worked together to combat the problem .			0
