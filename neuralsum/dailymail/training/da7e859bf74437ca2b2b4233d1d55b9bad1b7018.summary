she stated that @entity1 was ' controlling , dominating and , at times , abusive ' of ms @entity14			1
she found he lied ' with telling ease ' and distorted the truth when he took the stand			2
' at many times in his evidence the accused struck me as being a person playing a role , telling a story which fit with the objective evidence but which did no more than that , ' @entity38 reported @entity57			0
' his account of what happened appeared to exist on borrowed detail			0
' @entity73 had told the court that @entity1 was domineering and had tried to control everything his fiancee did , even the way she wore her hair and what clothes she chose to go out in			2
@entity1 had admitted during the trial that he was a ‘ jealous partner			2
’ ‘ she would wear revealing clothes , sometime with no bra			0
i would tell her she should continue to look beautiful but just to tone down how much she was revealing of her body so she did n’t attract the wrong attention and give out the wrong signals , ’ he told the court			0
but his defence team claimed that miss @entity14 ’s struggle with an eating disorder may have been the reason she jumped to her death			2
the judge began her summing up by examining the relationship between @entity1 and his fiancee , saying she had sought to avoid being influenced by the ‘ shocking and tragic ’ nature of miss @entity14 ’s death			1
there was no doubt , she said , that the couple loved each other			0
but the judge said that ‘ by the time of her death , @entity14 had no friends except a personal trainer and a counsellor			1
struggle : the prosecutor asked @entity1 if he had used his ' superior strength as a male to commit a serious act of aggression ' when he dragged miss @entity14 back into their unit before her death ( above ) @entity1 , she said , had used @entity114 cameras to monitor miss @entity14 ’s movements in their 15th storey apartment and the scrutiny she was subjected to was ‘ intrusive and overbearing			1
’ judge @entity23 said the relationship reached the point when miss @entity14 changed her @entity121 status to ‘ single ’ and had signed a contract to store her belongings in @entity124 as she prepared to leave her controlling fiancé			1
on the day that @entity1 found miss @entity14 had packed her bags , said the judge , he reacted ‘ with nothing short of rage ’ and she did not accept his denial that he had made enraged threats			1
‘ i have no hesitation accepting evidence of … rage , ’ said the judge			2
his denials were ‘ manifestly implausible … he was controlling and abusive … out of control , ’ she added			0
@entity1 sat in the dock clutching a small cup of water as the verdict was being delivered , his new girlfriend , brunette @entity31 sitting in the public gallery			1
evidence : @entity114 footage shows @entity1 holding his hands on his head as he rides a lift moments after he threw his fiancee to her death off the 15th - floor balcony of their @entity12 apartment gesticulating : @entity1 throws his hands up in the air as he heads to the ground floor where the body of his girlfriend is lying in the street by the end of july @entity1 ’s relationship with miss @entity14 had reached crisis point , the judge noted			1
‘ i do not think there can be any doubt the accused was controlling , dominating and at time abusive			0
’ the night before her death , the couple had watched @entity169 in bed before he got up to watch porn on the morning of his girlfriend ’s death			0
‘ i find it difficult to believe he was watching porn ’ on the morning of the death , ’ said the judge , adding she assumed he had instead got up to monitor her emails and text messages			0
' by 6am on the morning of her death , @entity14 was in a state of absolute fear and despair , ’ said the judge			1
she referred to a witness , @entity184 ’ who had told the court of seeing @entity1 throwing something from the balcony , evidence , she said , that was ‘ compelling ’			2
the judge did not believe @entity1 ’s account of how miss @entity14 fell to her death - he had told the court he had tried to grab her when she climbed onto the balcony but had failed to stop her falling			1
‘ it ’s difficult to articulate my impression of that evidence except that i found him unconvincing , ’ said the judge			2
' by 6am on the morning of her death , @entity14 was in a state of absolute fear and despair , ’ said the judge ' at many times in his evidence , the accused struck me as being a person playing a role , telling a story which fitted with the objective evidence but which did no more than that			1
‘ his account of what happened appeared to exist on borrowed detail			0
’ as justice @entity23 ’s verdict details entered their fourth hour , @entity1 ’s girlfriend began to sob , while he stared straight ahead at the judge			1
the judge had up to that point said little that gave him any hope of walking away from the court a free man			0
she said @entity220 could not have behaved in the way @entity1 said she had - clambering onto the balcony - without leaving fingerprints			2
she said it was likely that @entity220 was rendered unconscious before she plunged to her death			0
speaking outside court , an emotional @entity226 told reporters ' there are no winners in this case '			0
' two families have had their lives dramatically changed forever , ' she said reported @entity235			0
' we will always mourn the loss of our beautiful @entity238 and are working towards making her legacy a powerful wake - up call to young women			0
' my daughter used to say people can ask for help but children and animals can not			0
' and now young women who are caught up in situations like my daughter found herself in need a voice as well			0
