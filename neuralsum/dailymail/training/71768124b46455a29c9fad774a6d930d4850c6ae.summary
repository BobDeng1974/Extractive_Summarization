when it comes down to football brass tacks , @entity0 is conclusive , unambiguous and to the point			1
off the pitch as much as on it , the towering @entity6 and @entity7 captain 's calculated demeanor demands respect			1
and the 6ft 4in defender 's mind is made up when it comes to his future , too			2
in the wake of the release of @entity19 's @entity18 presidential campaign manifesto , the 28 - year - old appeared informed in his response regarding the prospect of a future role at the international association football federation			1
@entity0 gave a frank interview outlining his thoughts on the @entity18 presidential election the commanding @entity6 captain ( right ) spoke out about the running of football 's governing body talking with the @entity32 and @entity33 , @entity0 opened up about the idea of working his way onto the ladder of football 's governing body			1
' i do n't want to enter that world of old crocodiles			0
if you see all the things that are going wrong at @entity18 it really makes me wonder			1
' we 're talking about the largest sports association in the world and yet nobody buries its head deeper in the sand than @entity18			1
there is simply no transparency			0
i do n't know why the football world continues to accept it			0
' ' whenever there 's a vote or there 's a decision it 's not transparent			2
it 's a very powerful , wealthy organisation but from my point of view so much of it seems to be about protecting this very old bureaucracy that keeps it within its own little world			2
' damning as they may be , @entity0 's assertions were followed by a hint of apprehension for former @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 star @entity19 , who will be challenging @entity73 for his seat at the head of the @entity18 boardroom table			1
the @entity7 skipper said he would not choose to get involved with the ' world of old crocodiles ' at @entity18 ' my only concern is how much legs this [ @entity19 's candidacy ] has			1
it 's one thing to present yourself , but my concern is about the system			2
how do you actually get the votes ? ' i have my doubts about how an outsider can change [ @entity18 ]			1
you know the people who vote ? @entity93 is threatening to them			0
they can pretend as much as they want that they 're going to implement change because that 's what people outside @entity18 want to hear			1
but real change ? i 'm not convinced the people who vote want that			0
former footballer @entity19 launched his @entity18 presidential manifesto at @entity104 earlier this week despite his doubts about the @entity18 hierarchy , @entity0 was on board with the concept of a @entity109 in @entity110			1
' it 's the world game so it 's right the @entity109 should be held around the world			2
if it 's summer or winter that 's less important			0
i just want to see @entity18 show things happened in the correct manner			2
' asked his opinion on footballers ' wages , the @entity118 raised a valid point for debate : ' of course it 's absurd but it 's a nuanced discussion			1
@entity6 's matches are seen worldwide by millions of people			1
football is an enormous economy			0
millions of kids are inspired by people like [ @entity133 ] @entity132 or [ @entity135 ] @entity134			0
millions of people make money because @entity132 is @entity132			0
' also , one thing i 've noticed is what a giving culture there is among footballers			0
if you look around footballers they are very giving to friends , to family , to charities even though they only have a short career			0
@entity6 could be without @entity152 ( centre ) for their @entity155 clash with @entity70 ' if you compare that with someone who works in the @entity159 , earning a similar amount for a longer period of their life , are all of them so giving ? ' at the business end of things , @entity6 face a tough week of fixtures heading towards march with a @entity155 last 16 first leg showdown with @entity70 separating @entity170 clashes with @entity171 and @entity172			2
the @entity173 sit seven points adrift of league leaders @entity176 before hosting @entity178 's men on saturday and their skipper knows his side 's work is cut out for them			0
' i would love to be able to win the league by ten or 15 points , just for the sake of having a smooth end of the season , but we always have to do it the hard way - every single time			0
' ' it 's going to have to be the same again , but that 's what shows we 're still a club that needs to make so much more progress			0

@entity0 said that he would avoid working within with @entity18
the @entity6 captain spoke about the governing body 's *heirarchy*
@entity0 defended his wages , calling the debate a ' nuanced discussion '
