a mother jailed for allowing her children to ‘ pick and choose ’ when they went to school because she thought they would learn ‘ more on a beach than in a hot stuffy classroom ’ now admits she was wrong			1
@entity6 , 42 , said prison was the wake - up call she needed and that her children all now had 100 per cent attendance records			1
miss @entity6 said she initially wanted her six children to have ‘ an amount of choice themselves ’			1
she admitted that if her two older children were up late and ‘ did n’t fancy ’ going to school she would let them stay off			2
but their schools and her local education authority disagreed with her flexible approach and she was prosecuted five times before being jailed for five months			1
miss @entity6 admitted : ‘ when i spent my first night in the cell , the enormity of what i had done hit home			2
' i felt so guilty ; my stubbornness had meant i was on a prison wing in @entity37 , miles away from my young and vulnerable children			2
great outdoors : miss @entity6 let her children play truant because she thought they would learn more on day trips			1
pictured above are two of her six children - @entity19 ( left ) and @entity20 ( right ) ‘ i accepted that my views on education were not correct and everyone must adhere to the same rules , or there would be anarchy			1
it was the wake - up call i needed			2
’ miss @entity6 , who is single , has six children : @entity51 , 24 , @entity52 , 21 , @entity53 17 , @entity54 , 16 , @entity20 , nine , and @entity19 , six			1

she was prosecuted in 2008 and then again in 2011 and 2012			0
but the court heard her children ’s ‘ attendance issues ’ dated back to 2002			2
‘ if it was a sunny day and i thought one of my children would have been bored and sat staring out the window of the classroom wishing they were at the beach – i could not see the merit of them not being on the beach looking at rock pools , ’ said @entity61 , a freelance creative writer from @entity62 , @entity63			1
‘ i thought they would gain far more from that			2
i thought they would be far better actually there experiencing it rather than sat in a stuffy classroom			1
@entity19 and @entity20 : the children were looked after by other family members while miss @entity6 was in prison ‘ my ideas for education were always more outside the box and free - thinking , ’ she added			1
‘ i was all about the children having an amount of choice themselves			0
' this did n’t tally well with the national curriculum			0
it got to the point where there was no room for dialogue with the school and it was conflict all the way			0
’ reflected in her cell : miss @entity6 was jailed for five months in 2013 at @entity103 ’ court during the 2012 court hearing – which miss @entity6 failed to attend – magistrates were told that three of the children ’s education was suffering through their absences and one had missed a gcse exam			1

but the truanting continued and she was jailed for 20 weeks in february 2013			0
@entity122 said it has been working with her for a decade at a cost of about £ 15,000 and prosecution was a ‘ last resort ’			0
education welfare officer @entity126 told the court : ‘ @entity6 is a capable woman but has a very odd outlook as far as education is concerned			1
’ the court heard that three of the children ; @entity54 , @entity20 and @entity19 , missed more than a third of sessions between september and december 2012 – equalling 73 whole days			0
