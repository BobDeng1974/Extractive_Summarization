by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 03:07 est , 2 may 2013 updated : 14:04 est , 7 may 2013 @entity3 leader sheik @entity2 has hinted that they are ready to support president @entity5 in the @entity7 war the leader of @entity3 has hinted he is ready support the @entity5 regime in the @entity7 war			1
@entity2 , the leader of the powerful @entity15 @entity14 militia , warned on tuesday during a rare interview that @entity7 had ' real friends ' who would not allow it ' to fall into the hands ' of @entity20 , @entity21 and even @entity23 extremists			2
his comments came after @entity20 president @entity25 that he was ready to up the game in @entity7 , following reports of chemical weapons allegedly used by @entity7 president @entity5 fighters			1
@entity3 has previously only sent small groups of fighters for battles with other @entity15 groups fighting in @entity7 but seems to have been provoked by @entity25 's comments into a stronger stance			1
the @entity37 on tuesday reported senior officials describing @entity25 as ready to move on what one described as the ' left - hand side ' of a broad spectrum that ranged from ' arming the opposition to boots on the ground			0
' consequently , the @entity7 regime has got the support that it needs from @entity3 , an impressive @entity15 military group which proved its capability when it defeated highly equipped @entity21 army soldiers who invaded @entity15 briefly in the summer of 2006			1
on tuesday the @entity3 leader openly acknowledged for the first time that its fighters were battling rebels in neighbouring @entity7 , an intervention that is already threatening to drag @entity15 deeper into that conflict			2
@entity2 appeared to be referring to @entity55 , a patron of both @entity3 and the @entity7 government , as well as @entity3 itself , which has relied entirely in the past on @entity55 and @entity7 to supply its arms			1
' you wo n’t be able to bring down @entity62 and you can not bring down the regime , militarily , ' @entity2 said			0
' the battle will be long			0
' yet it ’s more @entity3 ’s link with @entity55 which is believed to be a decisive move to up the stakes with @entity69			0
his comments came after president @entity25 strongly suggested he would consider military action against @entity7 if it can be confirmed that president @entity5 's government used chemical weapons images emerged last week from @entity7 of people who had apparently been injured by chemical weapons @entity55 has nuclear weapons as well as the ability to produce chemical weapons			1
also , if the @entity7 regime needs to move some of its chemical weapons quickly , the only destination can be @entity3 held areas of @entity15			1
alternatively , those same weapons could be moved within @entity7 and guarded by @entity3 fighters , considered to be highly disciplined and far superior to their @entity87 comrades			2
this week president @entity25 is reported to be trying to rally support from international supporters of his plans to oust @entity5 with a much more decisive role in arming the rebels with much heavier and lethal firepower			1
@entity96 foreign secretary @entity95 is also currently battling with @entity98 foreign ministers in @entity99 to try and lift the current @entity98 arms embargo on the @entity7 rebels			0
@entity20 media reported that president @entity25 is preparing to send lethal weaponry to the @entity7 opposition and has taken steps to ' assert more aggressive @entity20 leadership among allies and partners ' in seeking to oust @entity5			1
until now , @entity3 has only made subdued public statements on the @entity7 situation to avoid further inflaming tensions within @entity15			0
but after the @entity3 - led government was dissolved last month , @entity2 is reported by many pundits to have calculated that an all - out push to save @entity3 ’s ally , mr. @entity5 , is worth the political trade - off in the long run			1
@entity7 president @entity118 , centre , has denied that his regime has used chemical weapons in the war a wounded @entity7 man holding his injured son after an air raid in the northwestern of @entity7			1
there is growing pressure on international community to help resolve the conflict it would not be the first time that @entity3 has used a war to increase its political support ahead of key elections			2
in 2006 , it virtually got a 100 per cent backing from the entire @entity14 community in @entity15 after giving the @entity21 a bloody nose on the battlefields of southern @entity15			0
@entity15 leaders are struggling to form a new government , deeply divided by the @entity7 conflict , despite the country ’s official policy of ' disassociation ' from it			0
however , momentum is building in the country and this week @entity15 media reported that ' hundreds ' of @entity148 hard - core @entity23 were lining up to join @entity7 rebel fighters , after a rallying speech of a @entity152 leader			2
@entity3 , meanwhile , seems to have gone back to basics and given up on the conventional rules of political horse - trading and opted for the @entity5 ticket			2
@entity157 is after all , a more familiar ground than the awkward setting of parliament and diplomatic foibles			0
but it ’s also about the new @entity15 prime minister fighting his own battle to have the crucial ‘ one third ’ voting veto removed from the parliament so that a new government will not be hampered by pushing crucial reforms through , by @entity3 blocking it			0
@entity168 of the list for reforms is addressing the issue of the arms that @entity3 has			0
@entity15 ’s ‘ neutrality ’ though is more important than many think			0
if @entity15 is dragged into the war and itself becomes a battlefield , then the @entity7 war becomes a regional war , something that @entity25 is fighting the bitter end to prevent as he knows this will play into @entity5 ’s hands .			1

@entity2 warned the battle in @entity7 ' will be long '
comments seen as hint @entity3 will increase support for @entity5 regime
comes after president @entity25 said it may consider backing rebels
images emerged from war - torn country last week of people who had apparently been hit by chemical weapons
