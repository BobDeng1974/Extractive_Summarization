by @entity0 - parkinson updated : 05:28 est , 17 may 2012 @entity1 has abandoned plans to build a giant fish tank in a house he wants knock down and re-develop because it does n't suit the needs of his family			1
the @entity8 striker was given the green light to demolish his £ 6million mansion in @entity11 , @entity12 , and build another but there was a last minute change to the application			1
documents submitted to @entity18 a day before it was due to go before a planning committee are pretty much the same but with an omission - the three - storey aquarium			1
footballer @entity1 's new house plan has angered his neighbours but now the plan for an aquarium ( bottom left ) will not go ahead the original plans showed a 40ft high fish tank stretching 15ft across and going from from the basement up to the roof of the second floor			1
the four separate tanks on top of one another would have been worth around £ 250,000 and would have held 5,500 gallons of water			1
it would have housed 300 fish and cost £ 12,000 a year to run , making the super-size aquariums owned by the likes of @entity41 , the @entity42 and @entity44 footballer @entity43 look like tiddlers			1
one local , who asked not to be named , said : ' @entity1 obviously had his heart set on the aquarium			1
' but in the end everyone around here was saying he was only demolishing the old house so he could get the fish tank specially made to his liking			1
' knocking down a perfectly good 13 - year - old house worth in the region of £ 10m is not something that is looked upon kindly if it is just to put a fish tank in , so a lot of us think he got round the council simply by saying he would get rid of the aquarium			1
' @entity65 home : @entity66 , whose garden backs on to @entity1 's home , and seven others have urged planning officials halt the proposal saying ' if someone wants a larger house why do they not just buy one somewhere else ? ' celebrity battle : @entity1 , left was urged by neighbour @entity66 , right , to move out of his £ 6 million @entity12 home rather than demolish it for a larger house to accommodate a monster 40ft fish tank actor @entity66 , who is a neighbour of @entity1 's in @entity11 , north @entity12 , led an attack against the plans , but the councillors gave their consent for the building to be knocked down and re-built			1
@entity86 ’s record goalscorer who now plays for the @entity87 - did not attend the meeting			0
@entity90 councillor @entity89 described the designs as ‘ fantastic ’ , adding : ‘ it is an outstanding contribution to the borough			0
’ @entity66 , the 70 - year - old actor best known for his portrayal of @entity97 taverna owner @entity96 in the film @entity98 , claimed the building of the house would cause massive disruption and was not suited to the area			1
@entity1 argues that his house , built in 1999 , has aged badly and is not fit for purpose as a family home			1
plans : @entity1 intends to rebuild his @entity11 home , although the original architect sir @entity108 is opposed to the demolition ‘ its interior spaces are cramped , deteriorated and commercial in feel , with low ceilings , narrow rooms and poor daylight , ’ according to papers submitted to the council by @entity119 , the agents acting on his behalf			2
the row in leafy @entity11 has been brewing since february , when @entity123 footballer @entity1 applied for planning permission			2
the @entity123 footballer – who fronted the ‘ va - va - voom ’ tv adverts for car firm @entity127 – is the latest in a long line of celebrities to take an interest in flashy fish tanks			2
@entity41 , the @entity42 , @entity134 and @entity44 footballers @entity43 , @entity135 and @entity136 , have all splashed out on opulent fish tanks			0
@entity43 has reportedly spent more than £ 100,000 on his 13ft aquarium , and is now believed to be planning a shark tank under his kitchen floor			1
it has been suggested that the celebrity obsession with aquariums may not be just about a fondness for fish			0
one tank designer , who asked not to be named , said : ‘ our client list tends to be male - dominated and they are looking for status symbols and showpieces			2
’ @entity1 bought his house in 2001 when he was married to model @entity153			2
the couple divorced in 2007			0
but he is understood to be keen to maintain his @entity12 base to be close to their young daughter , tea			0
his new home will also include a swimming pool and gym			0

@entity1 ’s new home is expected to take about six months to complete			2
before news of the successful planning application mr @entity66 said : ‘ they ’ll be drilling into the basement and it ’ll go on for months and months			1
' there are a lot of retired people round here or people like me who work from home – i write – and it ’s a terrible disturbance			0
‘ why do they have to knock it down ? i ’ve never met @entity1 and i ’ve got nothing against the man at all			2
i ’m sure he ’s a very nice man and he ’s welcome to build whatever he likes			0
but please not here , not next to me , with all the noise			0
’ @entity66 added : ‘ this used to be a wonderful place to live , but in the last ten years there ’s been endless , endless building			0

the house ’s original architect , sir @entity108 , a former chairman of the @entity204 , opposed @entity1 ’s application			1
he said the house has ‘ good daylighting and is in good condition but appears not to have been well maintained ’			0
