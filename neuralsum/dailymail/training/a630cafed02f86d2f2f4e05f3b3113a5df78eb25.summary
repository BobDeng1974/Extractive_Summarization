@entity1 events which inevitably involve a glass of wine or a gin and tonic can be a nightmare for those avoiding alcohol			1
but new research shows tee - totallers have come up with various ways of getting out of drinking without arousing suspicion from their colleagues			0
. from volunteering to be the designated driver to pretending they are trying to lose weight , a study found workers use such excuses as they do n't want to be seen as a ' holier - than - thou ' non-drinker			2
' in our study , we interviewed successful professionals who do n't drink , ' dr @entity43 said			1
' we found they felt being a non-drinker was a form of deviance			0
' however workers reported they did n't want to miss out on the career opportunities that come from networking and socialising			2
sometimes , attending functions was a requirement of their job			0
' non-drinkers developed a variety of strategies to attend social events without making themselves , their co-workers , or their clients feel uncomfortable , ' dr @entity43 added			1
the researchers found most non-drinkers did n't announce the fact that they were not drinking because they did n't want to draw attention to themselves			1
while some would answer honestly if asked , many declined a drink in ways that made their non-drinking ambiguous			2
using health - related excused like ' alcohol gives me migraines '			0
buying a drink but then not drinking it			0
buying a round of drinks for colleagues			0
saying ' i 've got an early morning ' or ' i 'm not drinking tonight instead of ' i do n't drink ' pretending you are trying to lose weight			1
volunteering to be the designated driver			0
for example , instead of saying ' i do n't drink , ' they said things like ' i 'm not drinking tonight ' or ' i 've got an early morning '			1
not wanting to be seen as judgemental or ' holier - than - thou ' , some would buy an alcoholic drink but not drink it , in order to fit in with their colleagues			1
if colleagues twigged that they were n't drinking , some non-drinkers would find ways to show they did n't have a problem with drinking by buying a round of drinks , or volunteering to be the designated driver			2
others tried to use humour to defuse any social tension			0
other non-drinkers would use socially acceptable ' excuses ' for not drinking to avoid being seen as judgemental			1
for example , one professional who did n't drink because he wanted to set a good example for his children told co-workers that he did n't drink because he was trying to lose weight			1
similarly , another professional , who did n't drink because she was taking prescription drugs to deal with a mental - health issue , told co-workers that alcohol gave her migraines			1
the research shows there is perceived pressure to conform to social norms in the workplace , the researchers argued			2
some workers would buy a drink and then not drink it , while others said they had to get up early the next day			0
another known trick is to order a clear drink which can imitate an alcoholic drink like gin and tonic ' this work highlights a challenge facing many non-drinking adults , ' dr @entity43 said			2
' it 's something that organisations and @entity136 departments may want to take into consideration			1
@entity136 departments who have historically been worried about problem drinkers , should also consider the needs of non-drinkers , she added			1
they should make sure non-alcoholic beverages are available at happy hours or host social activities that do n't centre around drinking , she said			0
she concluded : ' if employers want their employees to achieve their full potential , they need to foster an environment that encourages their employees to be themselves			0
' the research was published online the @entity154 .			0

non-drinkers use an array of methods to avoid alcohol at work events
some do n't announce they do n't drink for fear of *appearing* judgemental
researchers say @entity136 departments should be aware of the pressure to drink
