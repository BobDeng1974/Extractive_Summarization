doorknobs have been banned in @entity1 , @entity2 and many residents are up in arms over the new nanny - state rule			0
starting next march , the city will be requiring the installation of lever handles on all new building doors instead of round doorknobs			2
the @entity11 passed the new code in september in an attempt to make the city more accessible to the disabled and elderly			1
out with the old , in with the new : the @entity16 amended its building code to ban doorknobs ( left ) in favor of lever handles ( right ) to make housing more elderly - friendly the change was part of the council 's ' age - friendly action plan '			1
in addition to the door handle requirement , the city has passed similar building requirements such as wider door frames , faucet levers and minimum height standards for electrical outlets to create ' a more safe , inclusive and engaging city for all seniors '			2
with @entity37 and @entity2 living longer , age - related issues are coming to the forefront especially as the @entity40 generation enters retirement			0
according to the @entity43 , 67 million adult americans will have arthritis by 2030			0
we live with that , ' @entity47 , the city 's former chief building inspector , told the @entity51 ' when i look at what we are proposing , it is simply good design			1
it allows for homes to be built that can be used more easily for everybody			0
' the new code is n't retroactive and does n't apply to current buildings , but it has still angered many who do n't like the idea of their government dictating such a minor detail in their homes			1
' i can understand if you have a public building where everybody wants to have free access and that is a problem , ' said @entity71 , president of the antique door knob collectors of @entity37			0
' but to say that when i build my private home and nobody is disabled that i have to put levers on , strikes me as overreach			0
' foreshadowing : leading up to the vote , all of the @entity79 doorknobs in @entity80 were swapped out for gold levers @entity1 councilman @entity83 admits that the measure ' went through very quietly ' but is n't sorry it 's now a part of the building code			1
' this is all about [ enhancing ] accessibility , and it 's something we 're going to keep doing			2
i 'm not going to apologize for that , ' mr @entity83 told the @entity94			0

while the rule applies only to single - family homes and townhouses in city limits , the @entity51 hypothesized that the change would effect all of @entity2			2
since @entity1 is the only @entity2 city with its own building code , it is used as an example for other towns and cities in the country .			1
