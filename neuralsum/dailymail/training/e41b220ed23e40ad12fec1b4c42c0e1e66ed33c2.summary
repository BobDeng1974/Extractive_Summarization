support for a huge , $ 1.1 trillion spending bill funding every corner of government , faded wednesday as liberal lawmakers erupted over a provision that weakens the regulation of risky financial instruments and another that allows more money to flood into political parties			1
at the same time , conservatives remain unhappy that the bill fails to bar president @entity14 's immigration actions , and a key conservative grassroots organization lobbied its allies on @entity17 on wednesday to vote against the legislation			1
the measure also took a blow when @entity22 minority leader @entity21 issued a statement demanding that the changes to 2010 @entity26 regulation of complex financial instruments known as derivatives and a provision sharply hiking limits on donations to political parties be taken out of the bill			1
her support , and the votes of her @entity37 colleagues , is crucial to passing the measure , as are the votes of @entity40 republicans who feel their being shafted by @entity39 leadership in the @entity22			1
the 1,603 - page measure was unveiled late tuesday and its provisions will be scrutinized in advance of a @entity22 vote thursday			1
the @entity22 plans to vote first on a three - day extension of the current continuing resolution the government is operating on to give the @entity62 and the president time to act on the broader legislation			1
the government will otherwise shut down tomorrow at the stroke of @entity66 , less than 24 hours before @entity67 plans to recess until next year			0
the @entity22 said on wednesday morning that it had n't read the entire omnibus bill , but it was generally ' pleased ' with the provisions it had reviewed			1
still , the spokesman for @entity22 would not commit the president to approving the legislation if it arrives on his desk			1
' i 'm confident there are gon na be some things in here ... that we 're not gon na like , and we 'll have to sort of consider the whole package before we make a decision about whether or not to sign it , ' @entity22 press secretary @entity75 said			2
it 's unclear how shaky the bipartisan coalition backing the omnibus bill is , but the alternative is to keep the government running on autopilot until @entity39 seize full control of @entity67 next year or allow it to undergo it second shutdown in 14 months			1
nonetheless , top @entity37 were lining up to vote against the measure on wednesday			2
' i 'm not going to support it			0
i 've already found lots of provisions that are against the public interest , ' @entity96 rep. @entity95 said			0
' i find it surprising that some people are threatening to shut down the government in order to extract big benefits for big banks at the expense of consumers and taxpayers , ' he said			0
conservatives were angry , too , and @entity110 , the grassroots arm of leading conservative think tank the @entity113 , came out against the measure today			0
' why in the world would we want to lock in federal spending through next september that reflects the priorities of the @entity37 @entity62 that voters just thoroughly repudiated last month ? ' @entity116 rep. @entity115 said			0
' why in the world would we want to so greatly weaken our position to insist on the complete defunding of the president 's unconstitutional act [ on immigration ] in the next session of @entity67 ? ' democrats , including @entity22 minority leader @entity21 , pictured above at a press conference on @entity17 today , and conservatives defected on voting for the spending bill today , putting a government shutdown back in play if @entity67 does n't at least pass an extension to the current continuing resolution the government is operating off of by the stroke of midnight tomorrow the compromise spending bill would permit virtually the entire government to operate normally through the sept. 30 , 2015 , the end of the fiscal year , with the exception of the @entity145			1
funds for that one agency will run out again on feb. 27 , when republicans are expected to try to use the expiration as leverage to force @entity14 to roll back a decision suspending the threat of deportation for an estimated 5 million immigrants living in the country illegally , while providing work permits and eventually making them eligible for benefit programs such as @entity157 and @entity158			2
@entity44 told fellow republicans at a wednesday morning party meeting that the immigration ' fight will be done at the end of february when the troops , when the cavalry comes , ' a reference to the upcoming @entity39 takeover of the @entity62			1
the @entity22 said today that even then it does n't believe that @entity39 leaders will follow through on their promise to conservatives to stick it to @entity14 by adding language to a @entity145 funding bill that would block @entity14 's actions			1
' i would be surprised if @entity39 take the position that they are going to withhold funding from border security , from people conducting criminal background checks , from other elements of our federal government that are critical to @entity145 just in protest over the president taking an executive action , ' @entity14 's spokesman told reporters today			1
a @entity39 staffer familiar with the conservative strategy told @entity191 last month , however , that border patrol and other critical enforcement agencies in @entity145 would be deemed essential if it underwent a partial shutdown and would therefore remain open			0
that understanding has fueled conservatives lawmakers ' willingness to hold funds for the department hostage until @entity14 relents and signs legislation barring his own executive actions on immigration			1
they would prefer , however , if the entire federal government were funded for only the first two months of the new year so that @entity67 has more leverage over the president when it comes time to renegotiate an appropriations package			2
their irritation with the current package was further exacerbated when they learned that it contained $ 948 million for the @entity214 - an $ 80 million increase from the fiscal year before			2
that money will go toward making sure the @entity218 has enough money in the upcoming year to feed and house illegal immigrant children who travel to the @entity222 from @entity223 , as they are required do by law , until they are turned over to the proper authorities			0
conservatives are unhappy about the increased allocation for @entity228 because a bill the @entity22 passed over the summer hinged additional resources on the inclusion of language tying @entity14 's ' hands on immigration			1
now , they say , the @entity14 administration will get the money it requested and it will have no incentive to act in ways that decrease the stream of unaccompanied minors showing up at the @entity222 border with @entity243 seeking amnesty			2
the omnibus bill directs significantly less money to @entity228 overall than the earlier legislation , @entity22 leadership has pointed out , and substantially fewer dollars were allotted to the effort than the the president asked for			1
the compromise legislation adheres to tight budget caps negotiated previously between the @entity22 and @entity39 , freezing agency budgets , on average			2
it also includes several provisions to fulfill @entity39 policy objectives , including significantly weakening new regulations that require banks to set up separate affiliates to deal in the more exotic and riskier forms of complex financial instruments called swaps			1
but some top @entity37 , including @entity267 member @entity266 of @entity268 , supported the provision , and party leaders did n't appear to try too hard to knock it out			0
the measure is laced with trade - offs			0
@entity37 won budget increases for the @entity275 and the @entity276 ; republicans won a big cut to the @entity280 budget and a smaller cut to the @entity282			0
@entity37 blocked the most ambitious attempts by @entity39 to thwart @entity14 administration regulations on greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming , and on clean water ; republicans won a new concession exempting many agricultural projects from clean water rules and an old one boosting exports of coal mine equipment			2
@entity39 leaders distributed a lengthy roster claiming wins on spending cuts and policy and claimed significant support among the rank and file			0
' i think we won on policy , the budget numbers are lower than i ever thought it would be , ' rep. @entity302 said			0
the overall spending measure touches every part of government , from a provision to ease standards on school meals that were supposed to go into effect in 2017 to funds to restore the iconic @entity316			0
proponents of campaign finance reforms decried a provision slipped in at the last minute that would sharply increase limits on the amount that an individual may contribute to various national political party accounts each year			0
those limits would rise from $ 32,400 to $ 324,000 for donations to finance parties ' national conventions , election recounts and headquarters buildings			2
that means individuals could give $ 648,000 in a two - year campaign cycle , with a married couple capped at almost $ 1.3 million for an election cycle			0
' it is only millionaires and billionaires who can give these huge , corrupting contributions , ' said campaign finance activist @entity338 , president of @entity339			0
another provision drawing fire would allow pensions to be cut for current retirees covered by some economically - distressed multiemployer plans , part of a package agreed to unexpectedly tuesday after secretive talks .			0

liberals erupted over provisions that weaken the regulation of financial instruments and raise the cap on donations to political parties
conservatives remain unhappy that the bill fails to bar president @entity14 's immigration actions
the @entity22 will vote on the omnibus bill and a three - day extension of the current continuing resolution on thursday
