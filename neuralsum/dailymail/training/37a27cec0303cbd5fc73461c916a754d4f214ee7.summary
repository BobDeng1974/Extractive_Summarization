@entity1 boss @entity0 has accused @entity2 of underestimating his side in the teams ' previous meeting and says his players have nothing to fear in their return @entity10 fixture on tuesday			1
the @entity12 side looked on course for a memorable victory over the @entity15 two weeks ago as they led 1 - 0 with one minute of normal time remaining in @entity17 , but goals from @entity19 and @entity20 sealed a remarkable 2 - 1 win for @entity2			1
the result means @entity1 have only one point - five fewer than @entity2 - in @entity23 , but @entity0 has challenged his team to deliver a repeat of their excellent performance at the @entity28			1
' if you want to beat the top teams in the @entity10 , you need to be at your top level and hope they are not at theirs			2
' from our game two weeks ago , @entity2 get a mental boost after ( what happened in the ) the last three minutes			0
' they have had a boost in confidence - you can see a few of their players are now playing much better			0
' they want to win the game			0
if they win they can go through with nine points			0
' @entity0 has challenged his team to play without fear as he takes a training drill on the @entity28 pitch @entity20 is mobbed by team - mate @entity59 after scoring the winning goal in stoppage time for @entity2 in their @entity10 clash at @entity1 last time out @entity2 can guarantee their spot in the knock - out stages if they beat @entity1 and @entity65 also win at home to @entity67			1
the @entity15 will be desperate to finish top of the group to avoid a difficult draw in the last 16 , but manager @entity71 said on monday that @entity1 can be an even more dangerous opponent on their travels than at home			1
' i understand what @entity71 is saying , ' @entity0 said			2
' if you are a little team maybe you need to play counter-attacking football , but i do n't think we have the qualities to play on the counter-attack			0
' we have qualities to play football and i want my young team to really go for it against @entity2 - i want them to play their game and play without fear			2
' if @entity2 are better than us , we will congratulate them , but in the first game i do n't think we got what we deserved			0
' @entity2 train ahead of their @entity90 encounter with @entity1 , with @entity91 ( top left ) set to start @entity2 will progress to the last 16 if they beat @entity1 and @entity65 defeat @entity67 the @entity15 will be forced to field another makeshift defence with @entity93 ( achilles ) and @entity95 ( ankle ) still out			1
that means @entity91 is likely to take his place at the heart of @entity2 's back four again , but @entity0 believes the @entity15 have more than enough quality to cope			1
' if you look at our competition compared with the @entity109 , i think they have all internationals , players at a higher level , ' the @entity1 boss said			0
' i know @entity112 's normal position is left - back , but he did a very good job in central defence			0
he is fast , he is strong - maybe against teams in the @entity109 they have problems , but i do n't think so in this group against us and against @entity67			2
' you could say it is a handicap for them , but they have a lot of quality all over the pitch			0
' @entity1 have a number of injury problems of their own with influential midfielder @entity128 , forward @entity129 , left - back @entity130 and centre - back @entity132 all struggling with injuries			2
video we 'll go for it against @entity2 - @entity0			1

@entity2 could book last 16 @entity10 spot with @entity1 victory
@entity71 's team won 2 - 1 in reverse meeting thanks to two late goals
@entity0 challenges his @entity12 side to attack @entity15 in @entity34
@entity93 ( achilles ) and @entity95 ( ankle ) out for @entity2
three points at @entity28 and @entity65 win over @entity67 would prove enough to see @entity15 progress from group stage
