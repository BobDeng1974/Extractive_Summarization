by @entity1 reporter published : 17:02 est , 2 march 2013 updated : 17:06 est , 2 march 2013 @entity2 , two , suffered a severe gash to the head when he tripped in one of the @entity7 's new @entity6 but incredibly was refused treatment because it ' did n't deal with things like this ' a two - year - old bleeding heavily from a severe head wound was refused emergency first aid at an @entity7 urgent care centre – even though he suffered the injury in the waiting room			1
@entity2 tripped and banged his head on a chair , leaving a gash on his forehead that exposed his skull			1
his mother @entity22 pleaded for help but a nurse and a gp told her to go to the nearest @entity27 unit instead because they did n’t deal with ‘ things like this ’			1
mrs @entity29 , 27 , said : ‘ @entity2 was covered in blood			1
when i saw his skull i was hysterical			1
i begged staff to help but they would n’t			1
there was no comfort , no care and no compassion			2
’ mrs @entity29 had taken @entity2 to the doctor @entity37 in @entity39 with her husband , also called @entity41 , in may 2012 to ask about a skin complaint			1
the boy ’s wound was later stitched up at @entity45			2
a @entity47 spokesman said it could not comment on the case			0
the incident was revealed after a probe into @entity52 , which are earmarked to replace @entity27 units , found they are inadequately staffed , with some personnel not qualified to prescribe drugs			1
health officials are keen to roll out the clinics in order to free up space in over-crowded casualty units			0
in many hospitals , a @entity6 acts as the first port of call for patients , who are then referred to the @entity27 next door if necessary			0
but there are serious concerns the units are not up to the job - and could actually increase strain on the @entity7			1
in @entity73 , five major a&es have been downgraded to become @entity52 staffed by gps and nurses but with no emergency care consultants			0
the downgraded departments will be prevented from treating a huge array of life - threatening illnesses , such as shock , internal bleeding , most broken bones , breathing problems , heart attacks and strokes			2
@entity29 and her husband @entity2 were left furious when the @entity37 in @entity39 would n't treat little @entity2 there has been huge opposition from doctors and patients during a public consultation period , and campaigners argue that residents in some of the most deprived areas of the capital will be put at risk			1
the @entity98 report , written by @entity74 , @entity7 managers and consultants , examined 15 undisclosed @entity52 across @entity101			0
it said : ‘ the availability of particular types of service often varied by time of day			0
sometimes , this was planned ( so x-ray facilities might be available for only part of the opening hours , or @entity74 might be available for part of the time only )			0
‘ this variability increases the risk that a patient may attend for a condition that can not be treated by the service , increasing delay and clinical risk			0
’ some @entity52 offered a full range of services and skilled staff that was nearly the same as a fully functioning @entity27			2
but others were little more than walk - in centres that could treat only the simplest cases seen in @entity25 surgeries			2
some centres offered ‘ nurse only ’ services with no doctors on duty , which meant that the type of patient who could be seen and treated depended on the qualifications of the nurse on duty			0
the report concluded @entity52 should be able to treat or refer all patients who attended and that there should be no unnecessary delay			0
it has called on @entity7 chiefs to ‘ make sure that the advertised services are available consistently over time and not subject to variation depending on who is on duty ’ in order to protect patients .			0

@entity2 , two , suffered injury in clinic while waiting to be seen by doctor
mother @entity22 , 27 left ' hysterical ' after staff said : ' we do n't deal with things like this '
uccs set to replace @entity161 - but probe finds them *woefully* *understaffed*
