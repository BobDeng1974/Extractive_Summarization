police in @entity1 faced fresh outrage last night after it emerged officers undermined investigations into rape and sexual assault against vulnerable girls			1
a damning report revealed a unit which deals with serious sex crimes spent a great deal of time trying to ' disprove the word ' of some of the victims			1
officers in @entity0 's child abuse unit were also ' pressured ' by senior colleagues not to record rapes as crimes , it was revealed			1
chief inspector of @entity23 savaged the ' unacceptable ' culture within @entity0 's public protection unit in a scathing attack on practices within the force at the height of the scandal , @entity23 ( @entity23 ) savaged the ' unacceptable ' culture within its public protection unit			1
@entity32 , the official police watchdog 's chief inspector , said : ' this culture of dealing with reports of crime shows a disregard for victims and is unacceptable			1
' it also emerged last night that only three part - time police officers were responsible for catching rapists who abused hundreds of vulnerable children at the height of the @entity1 exploitation scandal			1
a confidential report by @entity0 reveals that up to 300 children were being sexually exploited in the county in 2010 , with the total number of offences ' in the thousands			2
' but during that period there were ' only three officers across the whole force with a permanent responsibility for @entity55 [ child sexual exploitation ] '			2
one of these officers worked part time and the other two had ' additional portfolios that take up at least half their time '			1
at least 1,400 vulnerable children were horrifically abused by rapists – mainly of @entity65 origin – who escaped justice for 16 years in @entity1 the report added : ' force provision for the policing of child sexual exploitation is not equivalent to the scale and seriousness of the problem			2
' it echoes this week 's damning dossier into the @entity1 scandal by professor @entity78 , in which she described how ' senior and middle managers were more focused on dealing with offences such as burglary and vehicle crime '			0
the revelations heap new shame on @entity0 just days after the catastrophic scale of child sex abuse in @entity1 was exposed			1
at least 1,400 vulnerable children were horrifically abused by rapists – mainly of @entity65 origin – who escaped justice for 16 years			0
police , council chiefs and social services repeatedly turned a blind eye to evidence that the defenceless girls had fallen into the clutches of a group of paedophiles between 1997 and last year			0
the officer who was head of @entity0 between 2004 and 2011 was best known for leading an ultimately embarrassing crusade against speeding motorists			2
chief constable @entity104 showed little sympathy for those clocked by speed cameras			0
he also demanded tougher sentences for hit - and - run motorists and those causing death by dangerous driving			0
this was going on a time when scores of young girls were being subjected to sexual exploitation including gang rapes , grooming and trafficking			2
his campaign reached a humiliating conclusion when he was caught driving at 90mph in a 60mph zone in 2007			0
mr @entity124 was disqualified from driving for 42 days and fined £ 350 , and was left with little option but to step down from his role as chairman of roads policing at the @entity129 , which he had held for two years			0
he retired from @entity0 in 2011 , before making a failed bid to be elected as the area ’s first police and crime commissioner			1
he has however been awarded a cbe for his services to policing			0
but now campaigners and politicians will want to know whether the focus on speeding motorists was to the detriment of child sex abuse victims in the area his force covered			2
mr @entity124 could not be reached for comment last night			0
@entity23 yesterday published a report criticising @entity0 for under - recording crime following a 12 - month probe from november 2012			1
inspectors highlighted the impact this practice had on vulnerable children who had been victims of sexual assault			0
out of 152 incident records , inspectors found that 117 crimes should have been recorded – but 24 per cent of them were not			0
@entity0 was found to have a culture of ' investigate - to - record ' , where officers do not record incidents as possible crimes until they have been investigated – in contravention of @entity163 rules			1
@entity23 examined 66 violent offences , including rape , that @entity0 had written off as ' no - crime ' but found 11 of these – just under 20 per cent – were wrongly classified and should have been pursued			1
the report said : ' this level of under - recorded crime is a significant cause of concern and is a matter of material and urgent importance , particularly as some of these relate to violence and sexual assault against vulnerable children			0
' failure to record crimes properly was ' particularly evident in the public protection unit , with a great deal of time spent trying to disprove the word of the victim from the outset '			1
it said : ' we found that where a victim is vulnerable , either through age or mental health issues , and it appears that there is any doubt regarding the authenticity of the report , a no - crime [ report ] is often submitted			0
' separately , the revelations over the tiny number of officers devoted to grooming came in a confidential 2010 report commissioned by detective superintendent @entity202 , the @entity204 force 's director of intelligence and public protection			1
by 2013 , the child sexual exploitation team at the force had increased to 11 police officers			1
but in that year they still had to deal with 294 complex abuse cases			0
@entity211 , the @entity212 mp responsible for exposing the paedophile past of @entity215 politician @entity214 , said : ' vulnerable children are being fobbed off and not treated seriously			0
' last night it also emerged around a quarter of violent and sexual offences were wrongly written off by the three biggest police forces in @entity220 and @entity221			0
@entity23 found 23 per cent of rape , robbery and violence allegations were incorrectly shelved by the @entity225 , 24 per cent by @entity226 and almost 29 per cent by @entity227			2
the @entity228 warned it may investigate @entity0 over its failure to properly investigate allegations of major crimes			2
but a spokesman for the force defended its record , saying : ' the public protection unit is victim - led and officers take great care to ensure all victims of this type of crime are fully supported throughout an investigation , from the moment a report is received			1
