@entity0 faces a wave of crime and disorder because of large - scale immigration from @entity5 and @entity6 , according to a leaked government document			1
in what could serve as a warning to @entity11 , the report describes overcrowded slum conditions , public health threats and disruption on the streets as a result of the influx from the two countries			2
the @entity0 statistics office estimates that 437,000 @entity5 and @entity6 have travelled to the country over the past three years alone , with numbers rising to 176,000 last year			1
a leaked report in @entity0 has warned that mass immigration threatens ' social peace '			1
pictured : an estate in @entity26 where up to 400 @entity5 and @entity6 immigrants live in squalor the leaked report from @entity0 ’s interior ministry – the equivalent of the @entity11 ’s @entity32 – says that migration from @entity5 and @entity6 poses a risk to ‘ social peace ’ in major cities			1
it says schools are under pressure because of the arrival of high numbers of non-german speaking pupils who hold back progress for local children			0
it follows a series of alarms from @entity0 local government organisations which have detailed the spread of prostitution and robbery , organised gangs of child criminals and poor living conditions that have come with immigrants			2
@entity56 said chaos was caused in schools where @entity5 and @entity6 children ' speak no @entity0 ' a young girl drops litter on the estate in @entity26 where hundreds of immigrants have moved the new assessment from @entity64 comes as @entity11 prepares to open its labour market to @entity5 and @entity6 citizens			1
limits imposed on the rights of people from the two countries to take jobs in @entity11 are lifted at the end of the year , seven years after they joined the @entity74			1
but the respected think tank @entity75 believes the opening of the jobs market may add 50,000 a year to @entity11 immigration			2
@entity0 labour laws allows @entity5 and @entity6 citizens to remain in the country longer than three months if they have a trade and a job , and the welfare system allows families to claim child benefits – which in some cases can bring in up to £ 500 a week			1
but wider limitations on the right to work are still in force until january , as in @entity11 and the rest of the @entity74			1
surveys in @entity5 and @entity6 have suggested that many people already want to leave – even ahead of the easing of @entity74 restrictions – and @entity0 is the nearest major country they can go @entity95 can , therefore , supply a model of what other nations such as @entity11 and @entity98 may expect from january			1
the interior ministry document says that crime – particularly prostitution – is on the increase in the areas where the newcomers have settled			0
the report describes ‘ extreme occupancy of dilapidated , uninhabitable properties with illegal dormitories ’ , adding that overcrowding could mean 20 people sleeping in one room			0
it speaks of ‘ dirty patios , overfilled rubbish bins ’ and ‘ noisy crowds into the small hours ’			0
it names the cities that have been worst affected by the impact of immigration , among them @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity64 , @entity130 and @entity26			0
the newspaper that acquired the leaked report , @entity133 , said : ‘ the document explicitly warns of the consequences for the social peace			2
’ earlier this year , local leaders in @entity26 demanded help to meet growing problems brought by @entity5 and @entity6 immigration			1
they said the city had seen an increase in prostitution and robberies and high piles of rubbish strewn over its streets since the migrants began to arrive last year			0
@entity149 , its left - wing mayor , said it was costing almost £ 15million a year to house , feed and police the new arrivals			0
‘ we are massively affected , ’ said mr link			0
‘ it is costing us millions and will cost us more by next year			0
’ he said anyone who thought the problem was going to go away was ‘ misty - eyed ’ , adding : ‘ we did n’t ask for this problem and we ca n’t handle it alone			0
’ in february a report by the @entity0 @entity163 said taxpayers now face ‘ significant costs as a result of this poverty migration ’ .			2

report warns of possible civil disturbance unless immigration is checked
