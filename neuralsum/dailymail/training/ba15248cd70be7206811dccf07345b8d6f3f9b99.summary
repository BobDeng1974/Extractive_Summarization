by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent anonymity : @entity2 , chairwoman of the @entity3 , believes people accused of sex crimes , including rape , should have their identities protected the identities of men accused of rape and other sex crimes should be kept secret unless they are found guilty in court , a leading lawyer said yesterday			1
@entity2 , a deputy high court judge and chief of the professional body for barristers , said the law should protect the identity of those charged with sex offences because the crimes ‘ carry such a stigma ’			1
‘ until they have been proven to have done something as awful as this – i think there is a strong argument in cases of this sort , because they carry such stigma with them , to maintain the defendant ’s anonymity , until he is convicted , ’ she said			1
‘ but once the defendant is convicted then of course everything should be open to scrutiny and to the public			1
’ miss @entity2 , who is chairman of the @entity3 , acknowledged that there were arguments in favour of allowing suspects to be named			1
‘ there is obviously a public interest in open justice , ’ she said			2
‘ people would say that they are entitled to know not simply who has been convicted but who has been accused			1
’ she added that if @entity51 had been accused of sex crimes when he was alive he should have been named			1
‘ in a case like that , people would say , if one complainant comes forward against a person it might give other people who do n’t know her , but who went through the same experience , the courage to come forward as well			1
’ the idea of anonymity for rape defendants was a surprise inclusion in the list of promises made by @entity69 and @entity70 when the @entity71 was formed in 2010			1
ms @entity2 says the law should be changed because rape allegations ' carry such a stigma ' ( file picture ) backing : @entity76 , who was falsely accused of rape five years ago , has backed ms @entity79 's stance but the plan was dropped by the end of that year in the face of criticism and fears that protection for some defendants would mean secrecy could be extended in future to others			1
@entity89 , a human rights barrister , said : ‘ anonymity for sex crime victims is unworkable			1
‘ why should somebody who is accused of a sex crime receive anonymity ? ‘ why do n’t we broaden that out to include people who are accused of beating children or murdering children ? there ’s no distinguishing case for sex crimes to be singled out , it has to be anonymity for all or anonymity for none			1
’ alleged victims of certain sexual offences , including rape , have been entitled to lifelong anonymity after making their complaint , since 1976			1
anonymity can be lifted if the complainant chooses to reveal their identity of if the court orders it to encourage witnesses to come forward			1
the @entity117 , which brought in anonymity for complainants , also provided for anonymity for defendants			1
this was done to provide equality between complainants and defendants , and to protect potentially innocent defendants from stigma			2
this provision was repealed in 1988 , meaning those accused of sexual offences no longer have any particular entitlement to anonymity			1
source : @entity133 victims and alleged victims of rape have been granted anonymity since 1976 to spare women from humiliation and encourage more victims to report attacks			1
the law originally gave the same protection to those charged with rape			1
but anonymity for defendants was withdrawn in 1988 after judges protested that it prevented police from appealing for witnesses			2
judges also said that the acquittal of a man charged with rape was enough to clear his name and reputation			2
but @entity76 , who was falsely accused of rape in 2007 , told the @entity155 : ‘ if the person has done a crime as heinous as that , then they should be named and shamed , i agree , but not until they ’ve actually been done for it			2
‘ innocent until proven guilty is a load of rubbish			2
i was guilty until i was proven innocent , and even when i was proven innocent i ’m still getting judged			2
‘ i ended up going to jail for something i did n’t do			2
‘ i was in the paedophile wing , the rapists ’ wing , the grass wing			0
i was there for three months before the dna results finally came back negative			0
’ the woman who falsely accused mr @entity76 , 42 - year - old @entity175 , was jailed for three months in 2008 for perverting the course of justice			2
in september , @entity178 reported how @entity179 ( right ) , 36 , was jailed for 15 months after she tried to frame her ex-lover for rape after he refused to rekindle their affair			0
@entity179 got drunk and dialled 999 at 2am falsely claiming she had been stalked and then raped in the street after being followed home			0
@entity188 @entity187 heard how @entity179 of @entity189 , @entity190 , then identified her ex as the culprit , wrongly claiming he had fled in a car after the incident even though he was at home all the time			0
@entity179 ’s unnamed former boyfriend was later arrested in a 4am raid in front of his current girlfriend and held for 11 hours			0
he was eventually freed without charge after @entity179 broke down and confessed she had fabricated her story after detectives uncovered inconsistencies in her evidence			0
jailing her for 15 months the judge , recorder @entity206 told her : ' this offence was malicious			0
' earlier the court heard how @entity179 , who was described as ' lonely and isolated ' , had had a fling with the victim in 2007			0
they had split , but on 2011 @entity179 had sent him a series of text messages in a bid to rekindle the relationship			0
when he did not respond to her advances , @entity179 began sending him abusive text messages , the court heard			0
shortly afterwards she called 999 and claimed in a rambling 20 - minute phone call that he had raped her in the @entity226 area of @entity188			0
police went to the scene after the false report was made at 2.30am on november 26			0
they found @entity179 staggering in the street and took her to a station so she could receive specialist help and support			0
when she was examined by a doctor , it was claimed she had injuries which supported her claim			0
@entity179 was interviewed by officers and told them how she had seen her ' attacker ' in @entity188 and he had followed her and raped her on the street			0
she said he then drove off in a car and provided the registration number for it			0
but @entity247 said the investigation highlighted a number of serious inconsistencies and when asked about these @entity179 later admitted she had lied about the rape and it had n’t happened .			0

@entity2 believes law should change to give anonymity to accused
chairwoman of @entity3 says identity should be protected until convicted
but concedes there are arguments on both sides for and against anonymity
