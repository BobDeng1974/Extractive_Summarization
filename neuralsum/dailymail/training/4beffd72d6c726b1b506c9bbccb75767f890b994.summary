a magnetic gadget is having remarkable success in alleviating @entity2 , also known as @entity3 it sounds faintly ridiculous – but restless leg syndrome , characterised by uncomfortable twitches in the muscles of the legs , brings misery to millions of @entity10			1
some experts suggest that up to 15 per cent of the population could be affected , and although many simply put up with the condition , some are prescribed sleeping pills , anti-epileptic drugs and benzodiazepine , all of which can have serious side effects			1
now , a magnetic gadget is having remarkable success in alleviating @entity2 , also known as @entity3			1
nine in ten patients who used the device – a @entity27 - adjustable leg - wrap – found it eased symptoms , according to a study by dr @entity30 , who specialises in alternative and complementary medicine at @entity32 in @entity33			1
the @entity35 wrap is fitted below the knee and above the calf muscle			0
during the study , patients wore their wrap 24 hours a day for one month			0
after five months , the majority said pain , twitching and tingling was reduced by 50 per cent			2
by comparison , just 20 per cent of users said drugs offered relief , and one in ten found natural therapies helped			1
@entity2 is thought to be due to problems in the parts of the brain that control movement – in particular the neurotransmitter dopamine – but doctors do not know the precise cause			1

yet numerous studies have shown magnets work no better than sham treatments in a host of illnesses they have been claimed to treat			0
sufferers of @entity2 are mainly female			2
pregnancy has been reported to offer temporary respite from the twitching			0
others say it worsens after the menopause			0
natural remedies found to be effective include supplements containing magnesium and iron tablets , although the latter should be used only in individuals with proven iron deficiency			0
