by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 08:45 est , 26 november 2012 updated : 08:45 est , 26 november 2012 more working people are living in poverty than families where no one has a job , a new study shows			1
work and pensions secretary @entity8 has repeatedly claimed he wants to ‘ make work pay ’ but a new report from the @entity10 shows how a million more working families are in poverty than households where everyone is on the dole			1
around 6.1million people are classed as being in poverty despite someone going out to work			1
by comparison 5.1 million people live in poverty where everyone is unemployed			1
the report said 6.1million people are in poverty despite someone going out to work compared to 5.1 million people who live in poverty in homes where everyone is unemployed the government ’s welfare bill has continued to balloon , after benefits rose by 5 per cent while earnings for those in work have on average gone up by just 1.8 per cent			1
@entity39 , chief executive of @entity10 , said : ‘ the most distinctive characteristic of poverty today is the very high number of working people who are also poor			1
‘ many more people have experienced poverty since the downturn , cycling in and out of insecure , short - term and poorly paid jobs			2
‘ tackling poverty requires a comprehensive strategy , but overcoming the frail jobs market must be the starting point			0
’ the amount of money spent by the government on welfare soared by 7.7 per cent last year			0
despite the @entity57 ’s efforts to crack down on the huge bill , it has risen by far more than the 1.8 per cent rise in average pay for those in work			0
the @entity63 think tank said the spiralling welfare costs do not fit in with the government ’s stated objective of making work pay			0
the number of people who are working part - time but looking for full - time employment is now 1.4 million , up by 500,000 since 2009			0
the number of working families who get working tax credits from the state to top up wages is up by 50 per cent since 2003 , to 3.3 million			0
work and pensions secretary @entity8 has insisted his welfare reforms will make sure work always pays millions of people are moving in and out of work every year , with the jobs market more insecure than ever			2
@entity83 , research director of @entity84 which wrote the @entity10 report , said : ‘ low wages are a drag on economic recovery and cause families to struggle with the costs they face , trapping them below the breadline			2
‘ changes across five decades demonstrate poverty is not inevitable - reductions in child and pensioner poverty show that			0
‘ but it is in - work poverty that is becoming the modern face of hardship , and at the same time support for working people is being cut			1
the high level of in - work poverty undermines any idea that better incentives to enter work , the centrepiece of @entity109 , is some kind of cure - all			2
’ the @entity114 insisted welfare reforms will improve the lives of some of the poorest families			0
the new @entity109 , to be introduce from next year , with simplify the complex myriad of means - tested benefits			0
a spokesman added : ‘ it will make work pay - by allowing people to keep more of their hard - earned money as they move into work - and directly lift hundreds of thousands out of poverty altogether			1
‘ furthermore , for people who have been dependent on benefits for years moving into work can seem a big risk , @entity109 will reward people who choose to go back to work by ensuring that you are better off in work than on benefits for taking that risk			2

@entity10 says 6.1million people live in poverty despite someone in their family going out to work
by comparison only *5.1million* of those living entirely off benefits are in poverty
