@entity1 manager @entity0 was more satisfied by his side 's performance against @entity4 than their annihilation of @entity6 last week			1
saints continue to make a mockery of the doom merchants , with this 1 - 0 win moving them back up to second in the @entity12			1
@entity14 's first - half strike proved the difference as they secured a fourth successive victory at @entity18 's , although @entity4 made them work for it			1
@entity0 congratulates @entity20 after his match winning goal against @entity4 the @entity1 moved up to second in the @entity12 table to silence their pre-season doubters it was a far cry from last weekend 's 8 - 0 humbling of @entity6 , but manager @entity0 was actually more impressed by this display			1
' it was difficult because we did n't kill the game , ' the @entity29 said			2
' we created eight good chances and you know if you do n't score the second one it 's difficult			0
' @entity4 put everything in , changed the system after an hour and with the physical strength that they have it was difficult			1
' football is strange because the first half was much better than last week			0
i think it was one of the best first halves of the season			0
' in the second half we lost sometimes too easy our position			0
' they did n't create a lot , we deserved our win but it was a difficult one , more difficult than last week and maybe more nicer to win like this than last week because the lads showed great character and great ambition again			0
' we had a great support of our fans and a great win			0
' @entity14 repaid his manager 's faith in recalling him by scoring the winner in the first half @entity64 is tackled by @entity65 on the edge of the area as @entity4 chase an equaliser while the scoreline was not as sweet as last week 's , it offered match - winner @entity14 the chance to make up for last week 's disappointment			1
the @entity75 summer signing thought he had scored the eighth against @entity6 , only for his first goal for @entity1 to be harshly stripped off him by the @entity12 's dubious goals panel			1
' i heard it yesterday and i explained to @entity14 and his reaction was okay , ' @entity0 said			1
' maybe that was the reason he came to the bench and to say this one they will not take it away again			0
' he had a great performance - he 's fast , he 's a good player but his defending attitude is important for the team			2
' @entity14 thought he had scored the final goal in @entity1 ' 8 - 0 drubbing of @entity6 before it was chalked off @entity14 gave @entity4 a torrid time in the first half but , like his team - mates , was unable to make the same impact after half - time			1
city boss @entity97 was pleased by the way his side responded to a one - sided opening period , but knows that 45 minutes cost them			2
' from our point of view , we 're a little bit disappointed with the first half , really , ' he said			0
' we did n't really ask enough questions of @entity1 , made it a little bit too easy , showed them a little too much respect , i would suggest , which is understandable to a certain extent given their exploits last time out here			1
@entity97 was disappointed with how his players reacted to a dominant first half from @entity1 ' i think that was the case in the first half			2
they caused us a few problems at set plays and obviously from one of the ones we did n't deal with it dropped handily for them and they 've been able to dispatch the winning goal			0
' second half , i thought we were a lot better			0
we made a change very early on , got @entity64 on , and that gave us a threat in behind and that stretched the game			0
' it allowed us to control of the game and in the second half i thought we were the better side , but we never really created those clear - cut chances we need to get back on level terms			2

@entity1 defeated @entity4 1 - 0 in their @entity12 clash
the @entity1 moved above @entity142 to second in the table
@entity0 more satisfied than after 8 - 0 drubbing of @entity6
