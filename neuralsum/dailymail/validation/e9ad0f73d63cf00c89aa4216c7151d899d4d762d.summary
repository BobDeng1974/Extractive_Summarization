on the offensive : mr @entity9 said : ' as far as i can see , @entity3 has taken the entire @entity33 hostage and today we have got the ransom note ' not amused : mr @entity3 's latest interview also appeared to irritate the @entity2 's new leader @entity51 ( left ) , who declared ' i 'm the leader of the @entity2 ' in a bid to reassert her authority mr @entity3 , who also revealed that he ' identifies ' with @entity86 , said the @entity2 would join forces with @entity13 to vote down any @entity88 put forward by a minority conservative government			1
