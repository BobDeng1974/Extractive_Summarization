researchers found that basic methods to maintain good hygiene could add half a centimetre to a five - year - old as poor personal care can increase the risk of infection in the gut , thereby reducing the amount of nutrients absorbed			2
it could also reduce the prevalence of stunted growth , which irreversibly affects physical and mental development of an estimated 165million children worldwide , by up to 15 per cent			1
simple measures : improving the quality of water and washing hands could make children grow taller , according to the first study of its kind ( file picture ) the study 's authors say the findings are key to tackling the ' burden of undernutrition ' which causes 3.1million deaths annually and accounts for nearly half of all deaths of under - fives			2

it examined 14 studies conducted in low - and middle - income countries including @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 using data on 9,000 children			1

' lead author , dr @entity90 , who is also a senior research fellow at the @entity79 , added : ' providing clean water , sanitation and hygiene is an effective way to reduce the incidence and associated deaths from diseases such as diarrhoea â€“ which remains the third biggest killer of under - fives worldwide			0
' for the first time our analysis suggests that better access to these services may also have a small but important impact on the growth of young children			0
