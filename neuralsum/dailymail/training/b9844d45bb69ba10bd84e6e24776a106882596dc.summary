@entity12 's first goal in nine months handed @entity5 their first win in 10 games in an edgy 1 - 0 victory at @entity16 on tuesday night			1
@entity5 assistant manager @entity3 left his role at the @entity19 club last week @entity0 ( far left ) has refuted claims suggesting @entity3 left on bad terms after denying any rift with @entity3 , @entity0 hailed @entity12 's resolve in notching his 30th goal in 60 @entity19 games , his first since knee surgery in march			1
' if anyone wants to know about @entity3 , i 'll put it on your plate so you know : there 's absolutely no problem whatsoever , ' said @entity0			1
former @entity37 lynchpin @entity3 's party line for quitting his @entity5 post was to focus on his role with the @entity40			1
@entity0 added : ' he 's got a lot of commitments with @entity43 , he 's never had a break from going away with @entity43 , and never had a break from @entity5			1
so i totally respect his decision			2
' contrary to reports , there was absolutely nothing , absolutely no bust - up , no arguing , nothing like that			1
' i thank him for his time coming to work for me			2
' i spoke to him before the @entity55 game , after the @entity55 game , and we still have the same relationship			0
so i just want to put that to bed , alright ? ' back to your point , it 's a massive four points in the last two away games , and we 're four games unbeaten			0
' two young centre halves having played well , @entity12 back in with a goal and i thought @entity69 was fantastic			0
' @entity12 wheels away in celebration after scoring against @entity16 at @entity72 @entity12 scored his first goal since march against @entity75 's side during the first half @entity5 crept up to 12th courtesy of just their fourth league win in 14 games this term , with @entity16 left frustrated due to toothless final - third play			1
@entity0 hailed @entity12 's return to goal - scoring form after a poor red card against @entity86 last month cost him a three - match ban			1
' he 's missed half the year , so that 's the magnitude of it ( his 30th goal in 60 league games ) , i 'm delighted for him , ' said @entity0			1
' it was a great goal from @entity94 today			0

@entity75 labelled @entity103 's outstanding player this term , but conceded the centre back suffered ' cruel punishment ' for his error			0
@entity16 goalkeeper @entity108 dives to his left but is unable to stop @entity12 's strike from going into his net @entity75 was disappointed with @entity98 's ' unfortunate ' mistake which led to @entity12 's winner ' i think he should have kicked it over the stand , and not be ashamed to do it , ' said @entity75 of @entity98 's costly error			2
' @entity118 ( @entity119 ) could have come out as well , but these decisions they make , they stand or fall			0
' it 's unfortunate for @entity124 because he 's probably been our best player			0
it 's a cruel punishment , but hopefully he 'll learn by that : you ca n't score in row z can you ? ' i ca n't fault the effort , i thought we started really well , played some good stuff and created some good chances			2
' you 've got to make your own lucky really , and we just lacked that little bit of quality			0
' i thought @entity12 just held them together , it 's nice to have that type of player			0
' we are disappointed the way the goal was given away and they did n't have to work hard for their goal			0
' it just was n't to be , just the gambling in the box , predators who latch onto knock - downs : they are the ones that count , and you 've got to take advantage of opportunities like that			2
