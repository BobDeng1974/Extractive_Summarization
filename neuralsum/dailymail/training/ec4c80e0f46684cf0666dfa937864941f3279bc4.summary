by @entity0 published : 14:53 est , 20 june 2013 updated : 17:18 est , 20 june 2013 a jury of six women , five of them white and the other a minority , was picked today to decide the second - degree murder trial of @entity7 , a neighborhood watch volunteer who says he shot an unarmed black teenager , @entity8 , in self - defense			1
prosecutors have said @entity7 , 29 , racially profiled the 17 - year - old @entity8 as he walked back from a convenience store on feb. 26 , 2012 , in the rain , wearing a dark hooded shirt			1
@entity7 identifies himself as @entity14 , but the race and ethnicity of the minority chosen for the jury was not immediately available			1
in @entity28 , 12 jurors are required only for criminal trials involving capital cases , when the death penalty is being considered			1
@entity8 's shooting death and the initial decision not to charge @entity7 led to public outrage and demonstrations around the nation , with some accusing @entity27 police of failing to thoroughly investigate the shooting			1
the six jurors were culled from a pool of 40 jury candidates who made it into a second round of jury questioning			2
before selecting the jurors thursday , defense attorney @entity55 explored potential jurors ' views on whether they thought sympathy should play a role in deciding a case			0
juror @entity62 , a young @entity14 man , said he was n't affected by sympathetic people because he 's never had many close relationships			0
@entity67 , left , sister of @entity7 , his father , @entity69 , second from left , his mother , @entity71 , second from right , and wife @entity72 , right , sit in @entity32 circuit court during @entity7 's trial @entity74 , left , and @entity75 , the parents of slain teen @entity8 , sit with their attorney @entity77 , right ' so when a person might seem sympathetic , to me it 's indifferent , ' he said			1
@entity55 also asked the jurors about when they thought self - defense could be used			2
juror @entity83 , a white man in his 30s , said he thought deadly force could be warranted if a person feels danger			2
' i feel that if you 're somewhere you 're supposed to be and allowed to be , you should have the right to defend yourself , ' he said			0
@entity55 met resistance from the judge when he tried to characterize the definition for justifiable use of deadly force			0
prosecutor @entity97 objected multiple times during @entity55 's line of questioning , eventually leading to judge @entity30 to twice read what will be the jury instruction once the final jury is selection			0
' i do n't want either side to give an interpretation on the law , ' @entity105 said			0
@entity55 said screening the prospective jurors for any biases or prejudices ' is probably as critical if not more critical than the evidence			0
' ' if you bring that into the courtroom , then what we ca n't get is a fair verdict , ' he said			0
@entity7 's father , @entity69 , @entity119 , listens to answers from prospective jurors			1

five of the women chosen are white and the sixth is an *undisclosed* ethnic minority
five of the six women are mothers
