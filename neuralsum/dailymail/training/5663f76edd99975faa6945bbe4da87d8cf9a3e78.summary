a clue ? a tuft of blonde hair was found about a mile from where 10 - year - old @entity6 's body was discovered prompting local station @entity28 31 to link the evidence to the case but @entity32 police investigating her murder are dismissing claims that the hair is a definite clue in the case			1
after @entity41 's @entity28 news team made the so - called potential evidence public in an ' exclusive ' report yesterday , investigator @entity39 ruled ' 60 percent ' of the new station 's reporting ' erroneous and bad information			0
' misleading : an investigator on the case called @entity28 31 's reporting ' erroneous ' and said that the police still do not even know if the hair was human let alone @entity6 's he told the @entity52 that so far there is nothing to suggest the hair has anything to do with @entity6 or is even human			1
' we do n't even know if this is dog hair yet , ' he said			0
' like everything else , every tip we 've gotten , it was taken and we 'll take a look at it to see if it 's connected			2
' the most recent clue in the tragic investigation that police are examining carefully , appeared in the form of a wooden cross last week			1
pictures of the cross , which is 1.5 inches tall by 1 inch wide with a hole at the top so it can be worn as a necklace , were released by @entity74 on friday			2
from missing to murdered : the @entity16 schoolgirl 's gruesomely dismembered body was discovered in a park 10 miles from her home on october 11 , six days after she vanished on her way to school ' authorities are looking for someone who may carry or wear this type of cross , may have recently purchased one of these , or is known to have some association with one , ' @entity74 mr @entity39 said in a statement			1
police are also looking for local businesses that may sell these types of crosses			0
the solid wood pendant has three vertical markings etched into the horizontal bar of the cross and a zig - zag pattern carved into the opposite side			0
recent clue : pictures of the cross , which is 1.5 inch tall by 1 inch wide with a hole at the top so it can be worn as a necklace , were released by @entity74 today ' the cross appears to be a solid piece of wood and the upper post portion is offset from the lower post below the short horizontal section , ' mr @entity39 said			2
he added that the item ' could become a pivotal piece of evidence that helps authorities identify and locate @entity6 's killer			1
' last thursday , police revealed that they suspect @entity6 's killer may have attempted to abduct a woman in the same area months earlier			1
in the previous abduction attempt , a 22 - year - old woman jogging around a lake about a half - mile from the @entity6 home was grabbed from behind by a man who placed a rag with a chemical odor to it over her mouth			2

' police believe there may be a connection between the @entity6 murder and the attempted abduction at @entity144 , and urge the public to specifically look for someone with a cross like this that matches the suspect 's description from @entity144 , ' mr @entity39 said			1
