by @entity0 published : 06:17 est , 18 march 2013 updated : 20:07 est , 18 march 2013 town hall officials have quizzed residents about their sexuality – in a survey on wheelie bins			1
the questionnaire , sent by @entity8 council to thousands of homes , posed a number of mundane questions relating to recycling reward schemes , the sizes of bins and whether respective properties had adequate space to store them			1
but it had a bizarre sting in the tail			0
one of the questions in the ‘ about you ’ section asked : ‘ which of the following most accurately describes your sexual orientation ? ’ ' mind your own business ' : residents were asked about their sexuality in a questionnaire on rubbish disposal @entity31 : the question appeared in @entity34 's survey on its wheelie bin scheme the options available were ‘ bisexual , gay man , gay woman / lesbian , heterosexual / straight , other , or prefer not to say ’			1
the question has not gone down well with the citizens of @entity8			2
one of them , @entity43 , 34 , who was emailed the questionnaire , said : ‘ it does not ask if residents want such bins but is very interested in their sexual orientation			1
are we going to have different coloured bins dependent on one ’s orientation ? ’ @entity53 , 40 , added : ‘ what the hell has sexual orientation or religion got to do with wheelie bins ? mind your own business			0
’ the council responded by claiming that the question is one of the standard monitoring exercises to ensure the responses represent a cross-section of the city ’s population			1
wheelie bins : homeowners questioned what their sexual orientation had to do with their views on recycling communities secretary @entity74 today accused the council of ignoring repeated reminders from his department , as well as statutory guidance , by asking residents to fill out ' intrusive ' questionnaires			1
the question appeared in an ' about you ' section at the end of the form e-mailed out to residents , and said : ' which of the following most accurately describes your sexual orientation ? ' respondents were invited to select from ' bisexual , gay man , gay woman / lesbian , heterosexual / straight , other , or prefer not to say '			1
former @entity93 councillor @entity92 said : ' the survey does n't ask whether you want one [ a wheelie bin ] , but does ask about sexual orientation			2
' it 's typical pointless lefty nonsense , ' he said			0
resident @entity100 asked : ' why do i need to answer questions about sexual orientation / ethnicity / religion when responding to a survey about wheelie bins ? '			2
gaffe : @entity34 said the question was included in the survey to ensure responses reflected a cross-section of the city 's population a spokesman said : ' although we do ask those questions , as part of the effort to make the feedback as informed as possible , you will have also noticed that ' prefer not to say ' is an option to every question in that part of the survey			1
' communities secretary @entity74 said today : ' we 've repeatedly written to councils to remind them that local residents should n’t be asked to fill out intrusive questionnaires about their sexuality , religion and other personal details just because they ’ve enquired about getting their bins emptied or joining a local library			1
' @entity34 have repeatedly ignored this advice despite statutory guidance from @entity136 which states that this is simply not necessary			1
' at a time when taxpayers are watching their pennies this is just one indication of how @entity142 run councils like @entity8 are showing a complete disregard for taxpayers ' money			0
clamping down on sending out these unnecessary documents will not only save taxpayers ’ money but protect the privacy of residents of all backgrounds			2
' @entity152 , chief executive of the @entity153 , said : ' this is yet another example of how bureaucracy and box - ticking have become all too commonplace in town halls			0
' councils must focus on providing the best value for taxpayers ’ money instead of wasting their time and local residents asking irrelevant questions			2
' it is not the first time the city council has been made into a laughing stock			0
in 2008 the council famously printed the skyline of @entity8 , @entity170 , on more than 360,000 leaflets promoting the city			0
and last summer the authority spent thousands of pounds on a wicker statue of @entity176 olympian @entity175 doing his famous victory pose - before fans pointed out they had got it the wrong way around			0
and in 2010 thousands of voting cards had to be pulped after the wrong date was printed on them			0
it was later realised that the word ' @entity8 ' was spelled incorrectly on the cards .			0
