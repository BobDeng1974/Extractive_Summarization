we 've all been there			2
faced with @entity2 or the gym , we reach for the remote while promising to work out tomorrow			0
but what if we could see what the impact of our actions today would have on the future ? that 's what one @entity12 - based company is hoping to find out with its concept @entity15 face , @entity17 , which counts down the minutes to your death			1

@entity21 's design , which has been created with the @entity22 in mind , adds time to your life for healthful activity and subtracts time when you give in to bad habits			1
the idea came to @entity21 owner @entity55 following the announcement for the @entity22			1
' we saw an opportunity , ' @entity55 told @entity59			0
' we thought , ' ok , if time is really a human construct , how can we play with it ? '' while @entity22 says there will be nine official faces available when the watch launches next month , none are unusual in the way their approach time			1
@entity55 started thinking about a concept called temporal discounting which is the idea that you can discount the future in favour of the present			2
' tomorrow , i 'm the guy that goes to the gym , quits smoking , and stops eating fatty foods			0
but today i 'm going to have one last cigarette , ' @entity55 says			0
the app works by linking up with a user ’s @entity30 data , which then converts the user ’s activities into time			2

this is n't the first time that someone has come up with the concept of a watch that counts down to your death			1
last year , a @entity125 inventor unveiled a watch that apparently calculates a person 's life expectancy - and even counts down to the time they will die			1
dubbed the ' death watch ' , @entity130 was created by @entity132			1
but far from being morbid , mr @entity132 calls it ' @entity134 ' and claims it has been designed to help people make the most of their life and cherish the time they have left			2
to set up @entity130 , the wearer fills out a questionnaire by entering information about their medical history , including allergies or illnesses			0
they are also asked whether they drink or smoke and if there are any instances of cancer , diabetes and other diseases in their family			0
wearers are additionally asked about how much exercise they do , as well as how much they weigh before receiving a score			0
their age is deducted from the results to predict a death date and the @entity130 - which also works as a regular watch - begins the countdown			2
rowdfunding campaign , the gadget is available to buy online £ 49.99 ( $ 70 )			0

the watch is also integrated with @entity180 's mobile wallet , and can be used to view pictures and monitor news , and also connect to social media			0
it can use other apps ranging from @entity187 ride - sharing to music to home automation			2

in the meantime , @entity21 plans to continue working on the project and may create a version for @entity101 .			2
