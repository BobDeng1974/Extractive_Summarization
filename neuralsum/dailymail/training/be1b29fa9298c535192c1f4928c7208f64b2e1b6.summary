' i 've never heard of this happening before			0
the chance of finding it at that exact point - where our greenkeeper cut the branch - must be a million to one really so it 's quite a find			0
' we counted the rings on the tree to see how long it had been there and counted about 14 or 15 so it 's been there a good while			1
' mr @entity32 added that the ball was likely to have been lost after a wayward tee shot as the tree is just a few yards from the edge of the second fairway			1
