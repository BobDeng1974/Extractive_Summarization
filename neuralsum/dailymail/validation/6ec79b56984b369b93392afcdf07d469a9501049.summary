a woman who created a popular app promoting an alternative lifestyle after she was diagnosed with cancer has not donated the funds raised through sales of the app to charity as promised , it has been revealed			1
@entity9 , 26 , is the entrepreneur behind the @entity11 recipe and health app , which she created after she was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer			1
she shunned traditional treatments to combat her cancer and instead opted for a wholefood and holistic approach after trialing chemotherapy and other modern medical procedures			0
however despite publicising that large amounts of the profits from her app were going to charity , the money was never handed over according to @entity26			1
the app , which has been downloaded over 300,000 times , proved so popular she was flown out to @entity52 last year where she was told her app was to be included on the @entity55			0
the 26 - year - old has publicly claimed that 25 per cent of the business ' profits were being donated to charity , last year claiming that $ 300,000 had been donated			2
however ms @entity9 told @entity26 this week that those donations had never been made , citing disappointing app sales and miscalculated profit margins			1
neither @entity63 â€™s @entity62 and one girl - who were donated $ 1000 after questions were raised - received any money from ms @entity9 and the former were not even aware money was being raised in their name			1
ms @entity9 , pictured with her son @entity71 , created the app after she was diagnosed with brain cancer she has also released a cookbook version of the creations following the success of the app there have been revelations that the @entity11 business nor ms @entity9 were lawfully registered as fundraising enterprises apparently only $ 7000 had reached charities so far , after campaigns flopped and profit margins were miscalculated			1
there were also revelations that the business nor ms @entity9 were lawfully registered as fundraising enterprises , which could draw huge fines and potential jail time			1
@entity93 has contacted the @entity11 for comment and while they could not be reached at the time of publishing , they had earlier posted a lengthy response on social media addressing claims made in the original article			2
in the post to their @entity104 page the company clarified they were a ' for - profit ' company to the surprise of many of their followers , and claimed the discrepancy in funds was due to their inexperience in the industry			1
' we have , like all start ups , struggled with managing all facets of a new business , biting off more than we could chew , juggling internal and external priorities with little staff			0
' we have since passed our overdue business records and accounts over to an external business manager and accounts team , an issue we are reassured arises often with overwhelmed new businesses			0
ms @entity9 has appeared across a number of networks ( pictured on @entity126 ) speaking about her approach to healing last year it was revealed the app would feature on the new @entity131 watch apparently only $ 7000 of a projected $ 300,000 has reached charities so far , after campaigns flopped and profit margins were miscalculated ' they have been working over our finances for the last five months , and are still proceeding with a resolution in close sight			1
we were advised by this team to follow their process and allow them to finalise the donations once all business keepings were accounted first and brought forward , ' the post read in part			0
' our books are taking longer to bring up to date than anticipated			0
@entity148 forecasted income in october 2014 which was not fulfilled , creating cash - flow issues and unforeseen delays on finalising three discussed charitable donations , ' another section of the post read			0
also citing ' cash flow issues ' as ms @entity9 did when explaining the business model and why charities had received no donations , the lengthy response garnered harsh criticism from commenters			1
' appalling - your organisation not the media			0
money for charity does n't go into " cash flow " - that is beyond unethical , surely it 's illegal ? ' , one angry subscriber posted			2
' you have skipped the entire point in your very long and wordy response			0
you took money from people who gave you the money believing it would go to said charities , you failed to forward on the money , ' another poster wrote			2
' ... that my friends is dishonesty / theft in the highest degree and takes advantage of peoples good natures			0
shame on you , ' the comment continued			0
@entity93 has contacted the @entity11 , and a number of charities who were to receive donations , for comment .			2

the @entity11 is a health and recipe app created by @entity9
ms @entity9 started it when she was diagnosed with brain cancer
the app was *advertised* as donating profits to charities
but @entity26 revealed none of the money has been donated
subscribers were ' misled ' and shocked the app was ' for - profit '
