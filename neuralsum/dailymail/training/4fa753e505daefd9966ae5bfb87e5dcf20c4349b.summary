@entity1 bass player @entity0 has hit back at ' hurtful ' claims made by his 22 - year - old daughter @entity3 that he abandoned his first family to chase a rock'n'roll lifestyle			1
@entity3 and those who have published similar stories have chosen to misrepresent the truth about me and my wife , @entity26			1
@entity3 makes a series of hurtful allegations against me , each of which is untrue			0
she claims that i slept with a backup singer while my pregnant wife was at home with a brand new @entity34 she had bought for me			1

@entity1 at a hotel room in @entity54 circa 1988 - from left @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity0 and @entity59			1
i am not perfect and i am the first to admit it			0
yes , i had an affair during the 1997 tour			0
this was the only affair i ever had , and i told my then - wife straight away			2
@entity3 claims that i have been a neglectful father , and that i have been in contact with her ' less than a dozen ' times a year			1
i have always tried to maintain a relationship with @entity3 and @entity69 , but this was difficult in the years 2006 â€“ 2009 when their mother 's legal suit against me was on foot			2
during that period , meetings with the girls were often cancelled at the last minute and on more than one occasion i was met by a court process server instead			0
up until 2013 , i have been back and forth to @entity21 on average every 3 months during the year and i have always tried to make contact with my daughters			1
in 2011 @entity3 and @entity69 attended an @entity1 concert in @entity84 and i spent a day with each of them over the next few days			1
in happier days : @entity0 has hit back at claims @entity88 made , describing how her father ( pictured with her as a child ) did not accept it when @entity1 's fame ' fell to the wayside ' @entity0 says @entity17 's claims that she is only in contact with him via email is untrue @entity3 's claim that she was ' lucky to get an email on her birthday ' is both untrue and extremely hurtful			1
in january this year i sent the girls 8 hours of video footage from their childhood on a hard drive that i painstakingly put together			0
@entity3 and i were sending each other long and detailed emails up until june this year			0
she was the one who mentioned that the @entity1 mini-series was to feature @entity108 and that she was excited as he was one of her favourite actors			1
she claims that i sent ' a lovely egotistical email ' to her asking ' what did you think of @entity108 playing myself ? '			1
this is an extract from the email she sent to me : ' we have been keeping updated with the news on the @entity1 mini-series and have heard that @entity108 is playing you ! he is on a great @entity12 tv drama called ' packed to the @entity120 ' and is a sensational actor ( he 's huge here ) and we love him ! so that 's amazing			1
' my email to her when the mini-series aired was : to @entity88 feb 15 hey @entity3 , did you watch the miniseries			1
. ? ? he refutes @entity3 's claims that he is ' now married to the woman who used to wait for him outside of gigs while his family were inside ' writing that he did n't meet his wife , @entity26 , until five years after he and his first wife were divorced @entity3 also claims that ' he told us he was packing up and moving to the @entity138 to marry one of his conquests on the day we were moving house '			1
my divorce with my first wife had been finalized in 2001			2
in 2004 i sold the @entity146 property , where i had lived for 20 years and where my two recording studios were located			0
i did not meet my wife @entity26 until october 2005			1
i did not move to the @entity138 until november 2006			2
@entity3 claims that i ' thrived off a diet of sex , drugs and rock'n'roll '			1
anyone who has met me will know that i am a decent guy and a good father			2
it is sad that my relationship with @entity3 and @entity69 has soured			0
i will take my share of the blame for that , but i will not take it all			0
@entity3 also claims , sadly , that i have ' @entity162 syndrome '			0
i can only assume that she means that i am immature , child - like and divorced from reality			0
@entity88 ( left ) , with her sister , @entity69 , told how her father is a ' stranger ' to her			1
@entity0 said he wishes @entity3 had just picked up the phone instead of publishing the scathing article			2
@entity3 's mother and i divorced 13 years ago			0
the @entity1 miniseries aired in february this year			2
i am saddened that my daughter has chosen now , as she seeks to embark on a career in journalism , to publish this story			0
if she really does believe all of these untruths about me , i wish she had just picked up the phone			0
@entity26 and i married in 2007			2
she has supported me through the lawsuit and in my attempts to stay in touch with @entity3 and @entity69			0
she is a hard working , independent woman and the love of my life			0
she is a wonderful mother to our twins , @entity184 and august who were born in 2011			0
to have such cruel , blatant lies written about @entity26 and published around the world is devastating to us both			2
it is especially cruel for her as she lost her father suddenly a month ago			0
i find it inexcusable that the media has published these exaggerations and falsehoods without even attempting to contact me for comment			0
the fact that it has been reprinted around the world by many publications and websites , and still no one has had the decency to contact me , forces me and @entity26 to pursue my legal rights against the media outlets who have published these stories			1
@entity0 this is entirely untrue and will keep going around in circles			2
he is a master strategist , narcissist and bully and i stand by my piece .			0
