by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 15:22 est , 15 october 2013 updated : 16:03 est , 15 october 2013 an @entity4 town that once saw one of the early 20th century ’s bloodiest labor disputes has okayed a request to excavate a local cemetery where remains of victims are believed to be buried			1
a test dig last month revealed a small @entity12 , @entity4 cemetery could be the final resting place of some of the 18 strike breakers from @entity17 who were slaughtered during the 24 hour rampage by striking union miners in 1922			1
the @entity21 agreed monday to let historians , anthropologists and geologists continue their after searchers reported they ’ve uncovered five sets of unmarked remains in burial plots long since sold to other families			2
battlefield ? it looks peaceful now , but this cemetery in @entity12 , @entity4 was once the site of one of labor history 's bloodiest battles ‘ i think this is important for the city and to the families of the people already buried and those that may be buried there , ’ said @entity37 attorney @entity36			1
researchers say they have discovered evidence of five burials , but no actual remains of victims as of yet			2
‘ at this time we are not sure we went deep enough , ’ @entity50 geologist @entity49 told the @entity51			1
the excavation began last month after nearly a century had passed since those tragic hours in late june 1922 at @entity54 's @entity53 near @entity12			1
perished : this historic photograph shows @entity56 where some of the people killed in the 1922 massacre were buried in a common grave			1
historians will now excavate the site in search of their remains the @entity64 saw rapid growth in the early 1920s			1
beloved by mining communities , hated by mine owners , and mistrusted by much of @entity69 , the union sought safer working conditions and fair pay			0
this often came at the cost of the physical safety of scab workers and communities where mine owners sought to wrench power from the powerful union			1
a union - wide @entity64 strike , one of many at the time , was in effect prior to the @entity85 and even helped lead up to the tragedy			1
the @entity64 backed the @entity12 miners both because they were members and because they feared that if their mine was successfully run with scabs , then other mines would follow suit			1
one thing that has fueled the renewed interest is historian @entity95 ’s book @entity85			1
in his book , @entity95 contends that part of the @entity12 cemetery contains two burial layers			0
the lower one , he says , contains remains from massacre victims			1
the most recent dig at @entity56 was the third and came after two less successful ones that had some members of the community up in arms over fears that modern gravesites will be disturbed			0
a judge issued an injunction on any further disturbances in the cemetery			0
the city was later given the say in the matter and council members reversed the injunction monday			0
mayor @entity119 had said he believed there 'd been enough work done at the cemetery by searchers from @entity50 and @entity124			0
but those behind the excavation say they 've allayed some of @entity130 's concerns by using a less - invasive technique of checking soil samples instead of frequently using a backhoe			0
‘ they ’re trying to be as gentle as possible , ’ @entity134 , chairman of the city ’s public works committee , told the @entity137			2
rampage : this 1922 photo shows the ruins of a powder house which was attacked by striking miners during the 1922 @entity85 , which left bodies strewn across the southern @entity4 town after a rampage by fire union miners tragic moments : an airplane view of the @entity12 mine district just days after union miners on strike killed 18 scab workers and left hundreds of others injured during a national coal strike by @entity64 in 1922 , hundreds of miners at the @entity157 mine near @entity12 , @entity4 were among those who put down their tools and called for better treatment , better wages , and shorter hours			1
during the strike , the lack of workers across the coal fields of @entity166 and down into the strip mines of the @entity168 caused a shortage of coal			1
consequently , coal prices shot up with the increased scarcity			0
in an effort to capitalize on spiking prices , @entity174 owner @entity173 fired his unionized employee at the @entity12 mine and brought in professional strike breakers from @entity17 according to an account from the thesouthern.com			2
a hundred or so of the disenfranchised union workers met on june 21 in the @entity12 cemetery			1
back in town , hundreds of others stole guns and ammunition in preparation for what was going to be a bloody fight			0
they surrounded the mine and a shootout ensued , with both sides armed and firing at one another			0
after the @entity199 asked for a truce and @entity173 agreed to shut down the mine , the gunfire ceased			0
however , armed union men still surrounded the scab miners who remained standing			2
eventually , the standoff ended with the strike breakers surrendering			2
as the union men led them away from the mine at gunpoint , more shots were fired			0
some men were told to run for their lives only to be shot in the back			0
a group of six scabs had their shoes taken and were forced to crawl to @entity12 cemetery			0
one there , they were strung up together with rope and shot			0
@entity220 survived the shots and the union men slit their throats			0
all told , 18 strike breakers were killed , while just two union workers perished			1
while they do n't agree on exactly where , scholars generally believe the victims were tossed , without fanfare or a single visitor , into a mass grave at @entity12			2
two trials followed 214 murder indictments			2
out of 9 accused , neither trial ended in a single conviction .			0

the @entity85 in southern @entity4 saw the slaying of 18 strike breaking miners at the hands of several hundred striking workers over the course of less than 24 hours
two trials followed , but no convictions were ever made in the mass *homicide* case
the tragic massacre came at a time of rapid growth for the @entity64 and also helped *solidify* growing *anti-union* public sentiment
