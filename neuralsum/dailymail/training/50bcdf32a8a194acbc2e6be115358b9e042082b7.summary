they arrived at court together sporting broad grins			2
but for once the @entity3 had to be separated so they could give evidence independently in support of @entity6			1

the comedy duo also denied the suggestion that there was a policy of keeping @entity6 , 68 , away from female cast and crew members because of his reputation with women			1
yesterday they told @entity28 they could not remember the alleged attack and said they would have been informed if it had taken place			1
in the panto the @entity3 played the @entity51 policemen while @entity6 was evil wizard @entity52			1
in the witness box @entity9 , 69 , called @entity6 ‘ just a jolly nice chap to work with ’			1
he said : ‘ he was very nice			2
we did two pantos with him			2
i mean everybody seemed to get on			2
he was just like everybody else – we used to play cards together sometimes			2
’ asked if he remembered @entity6 ever ‘ struggling ’ with a young woman in his dressing room , @entity9 said : ‘ i do n’t remember that			1
‘ if it was something serious we probably would , but i do n’t remember anything like that at all			2
’ his brother @entity66 , 66 , was asked by defence barrister @entity67 if he recalled any inappropriate behaviour by the former @entity70 star			1
dressing room allegations : a stagehand said @entity6 , who was playing evil uncle @entity52 in a production of @entity45 ( pictured ) , groped her from ' head to toe ' until a @entity76 walked in on him he replied : ‘ no sorry , i do n’t			1
it is a complete surprise to me			0
he seemed to go home straight away after the show every night and that was it			0

‘ i think i would remember , ’ he told the court			0
‘ nobody told us about it if there was			0

yesterday morning a female @entity95 told the jury claims @entity6 groped a carnival princess at the opening of a hospital radio station are ' fantasy '			1
evidence : the @entity3 told the court that @entity6 was a ' fine man ' and did not require a chaperone around women the woman , who worked as a presenter at the station in @entity117 , said she watched @entity6 closely when he appeared as a guest at the launch in the early 1970s at the time of the alleged incident			1
she told jurors at @entity28 in @entity123 it was ' utter nonsense ' to suggest @entity6 became separated from a group of eight people meeting patients on the hospital 's wards			1
addressing the witness , @entity67 , defending @entity6 , said : ' the jury has heard from a complainant to suggest he and her separated from this group while inside the hospital ? ' the woman replied : ' he was with his wife the whole time			1
i was watching what he was doing the whole time because he was an idol to me			0
' it 's utter nonsense or fantasy that anything like that happened			2
' the woman , appearing as a defence witness , told the court that members of the press at the event wanted @entity6 to ' pick up ' two carnival princesses at the launch for a photograph			1
' i think i was a little miffed because the press were more interested in the carnival princesses than myself , ' she said			2
the woman , who was 17 at the time , told the court @entity6 was ' a lovely man ' and ' very professional ' during his guest appearance			1
' he was , he is , a great dj , an amazing person , ' she said			2
' it was just really , really exciting to have him come and open the radio station			0
' the alleged incident is not part of the charges against @entity6 as he stands trial accused of a series of indecent assaults			1

asked if he ever saw @entity6 acting untoward towards women , he told @entity28 : ‘ absolutely not			1
i did n't see anything of that nature at all , whether it was untoward or inappropriate			0
‘ i would say that @entity6 is a very warm , open , friendly person in my experience			1
‘ he would come to see us at the @entity183 once a week and he might come up to me and give me a hug around the shoulder			0
‘ that might be inappropriate nowadays but i took that to mean he is not just a colleague but also a friend			0
’ mr @entity91 , who joined the @entity11 in the 1960s and worked on @entity6 's teatime show on @entity70 , insisted the @entity206 would not have ignored women if they had come forward with allegations at the time			1
he said : ‘ i strongly believe they would be taken seriously , because in that era the @entity11 was like a civil service environment			0
‘ it was very strict , some of the attitudes were very old fashioned and there were different ways in which things happened at that organisation			0
‘ certainly there were avenues by which if a sexual complaint had been made it would have been acted upon			0
‘ the @entity11 , in my experience , would not shy away from its responsibilities in respect of where it was required to face up to the responsibilities of taking action			0
’ he said comic @entity230 was taken off - air after making inappropriate comments and he believed the @entity11 would have disciplined other stars if complaints were made			0
he said : ‘ i honestly think , as an organisation , they would have faced up if an official complaint had been made			0
’ asked by @entity67 , defending , if there were ‘ big stars ’ at the @entity11 who would have ‘ got away with ’ groping women , he said : ‘ i honestly do n't think so			0
fame : the former @entity70 presenter is currently on trial for sex offences			0

‘ when you work in the environment we were working with all those people at the time and they were very famous			0
‘ some were nice , some were n't			0
to us they were n't that special			0
if inappropriate behaviour had been spotted i think it would have been acted upon			0
’ he said in the 30 years he has known @entity256 he ‘ never once came across inappropriate behaviour or heard of any behaviour from @entity6 ’			1
earlier jurors had heard from @entity259 , who toured as @entity6 ' warm - up dj for 25 years			1
