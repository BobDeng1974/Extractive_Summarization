by @entity0 published : 06:24 est , 28 march 2013 updated : 10:10 est , 21 may 2013 everybody loves a good cuddle , and one woman is capitalising on people 's need for regular hugs as the @entity8 's first professional snuggler			2
@entity9 , from @entity10 , @entity11 , opens her arms to people who ' crave intimacy ' and want to cuddle up on the sofa , or even in her bed , and is earning up to £ 360 a day doing it			1
the 45 - year - old is happy to get cosy in front of a film or while listening to music depending on what her customers want			1
' it 's a theraputic service for people who want to be snuggled , ' @entity38 said			1
' people can just come and talk , or they can snuggle wherever they want for as long as they want			0
' people want to feel a connection			0
it 's something we have lost out on , touching has become a taboo			0
' so much love to give : @entity9 opens her arms to people who crave intimacy and want to cuddle up on the sofa , or even in her bed dressed in her pyjamas and slippers , @entity38 charges £ 45 an hour for her ' @entity57 ' business just by wrapping her arms around her clients at her seaside home			1
she even invites her clients to bring along their favourite pillow , blanket or teddy bear			1
@entity38 said : ' from the moment we 're born we want to be held , it 's just natural			0
' i think certain people are better at snuggling than others , but as i like to be close to people , i think i do have a skill			0
' do n't cross the line : @entity38 draws a line at full intimacy and cuddlers have to wear underwear at all times the service , which is the first of it 's kind in the @entity8 and just one of two in the world , is completely non-sexual			1
@entity38 's rules clearly state that ' any innapropriate requests or behaviour will result in your immediate exit ' and areas normally covered by underwear are off - limits			2
she insists that underwear must be worn at all times , and shorts and tank tops are prohibited - clients should wear pyjamas or a t - shirt and tracksuit bottoms			1
@entity38 launched the business after working as a holistic therapist for ten years , using the power of touch to soothe and heal			1
entrepreneur : @entity38 launched her business , be snuggled , after 10 years working as a holistic therapist but while her holistic massage has helped her clients deal with their aches and pains , she always felt that a part of the jigsaw was still missing			1
after heavily researching the benefits of ' snuggling ' , she opened be snuggled			2
she said : ' people love to be cuddled because it feels good and offers simple contact			0
' however , not everyone has a suitable cuddling partner , somewhere out there someone is in serious need of human contact , yet he or she has no - one to turn to			0
' at be snuggled , you will discover a safe , warm and non-judgemental oasis where you can step out of your everyday life , rediscover the pleasure of non-sexual snuggling and enjoy the many psychological and physiological benefits of cuddling			1
' @entity38 has also written a ' @entity128 ' for her clients , which is filled with detailed descriptions and illustrations , before deciding exactly how they 'd like to be snuggled			1
cuddle sutra : @entity38 even has a list of different types of cuddles that her clients can choose from			2
here she poses with ' snugglee ' @entity136 @entity38 's research has taught her there is a lot more to being snuggled than merely getting close to someone			2
' one proven health benefit of cuddling is the release of oxytocin , ' she said			0
' known as the feel - good hormone , oxytocin creates a sense of well - being and happiness			0
' in addition , physical contact with others can lower blood pressure and reduce stress			0
' but @entity38 , who is separated , is aware that many will fail to understand the basics behind her be snuggled service			1
she said : ' people think it 's weird for people to just want to be cuddled if it 's not sexual			0
' people have become so standoffish and political correctness has taken over			0
' i think i will get some criticism because it 's not a standard type of service i 'm offering			2
' but the way i see it , hostility is just a symptom of fear			0
