however , the same amount of unhealthy food was just £ 2.50 in 2012 , compared to £ 1.77 a decade earlier			1
researchers found that 1,000 calories of unhealthy food was £ 2.50 compared to £ 7.49 for healthy food the ‘ cost per calorie ’ of 94 key foods and drinks was tracked by a team from @entity14 , who used government criteria to define what was ‘ healthy ’			1
they suggested that more could be done to take into account the cost of living well when making decisions about public health			0

*scientists* compared the price of healthy and unhealthy foods for 10 years
healthy food costs increased from £ 5.65 for 1,000 calories to £ 7.49 in 2012
