@entity10 , an executive committee member of the @entity11 , @entity12 , told @entity14 radio in @entity15 that @entity18 co-founders @entity16 and @entity19 bragged to him about how they recorded a february meeting of @entity22 campaign staffers			1
that conversation featured a discussion of how actress @entity27 , then a potential challenger for @entity22 's @entity6 seat , could be targeted for her past battles with mental illness that left her ' emotionally unbalanced ' and stricken with ' suicidal tendencies			1
' @entity27 announced on march 27 that she would not run			0
he and a small group of his campaign staffers were secretly recorded during a feb. 4 strategy session in their @entity38 campaign headquarters on the tape , which swiftly made the rounds april 9 , @entity22 is heard suggesting a ' @entity50 ' strategy against @entity27			0
' when anybody sticks their head up , ' he said , ' do them out			0
' @entity16 and @entity19 were reportedly at @entity22 's @entity38 campaign headquarters for its feb. 2 grand opening , and remained in the building long enough to overhear the campaign team 's strategy session from outside a closed door , and to decide to record it			2
the @entity62 reported that @entity16 was a delegate to the @entity9 in @entity63 , @entity64			0
it cited a @entity67 story which noted that before he co-founded @entity18 , @entity16 ' was a member of the executive committee of the state @entity12			1
' ' although @entity16 appears to be a member of the @entity12 establishment , ' the @entity62 reported , ' media outlets are now propagating a version of the illegal bugging story in which @entity12 officials claim to have been blindsided by a scandal foisted on them by an unaccountable outside group			1
' @entity19 ( r ) is one of two @entity18 co-founders accused of making the unauthorized recording and giving it to @entity84 reporter @entity83			1
the other man , @entity16 , claims he was a ' witness			1
' his lawyer blames @entity19 for any alleged illegal activity @entity10 , the county - level @entity12 executive who blew the whistle on @entity18 's recording exploit , told the @entity90 that @entity16 and @entity19 bragged to him about what they had done			1
' they mentioned that they were there			0
... i do n't know why they were at the grand opening of his campaign office , but they were there after the event had ended , and were in the hallway			0
and they overheard the conversation going on , ' @entity10 told anchor @entity107			0
' it was a very tasteless thing that the @entity22 campaign did , ' he added , ' but it was a private conversation nonetheless			0
' they decided the record it , ' he added , and they told me about this			0
' @entity18 's main purpose seems to be to oust @entity22 from his perch at the top of the @entity6 's @entity121 pecking order			1
@entity122 reported in january that the group was approaching tea party - affiliated republicans in an effort to persuade someone to challenge the five - term 71 - year - old politician			2
a @entity130 video published in december shows the group organizing a ' fiscal cliff caroling ' event on the sidewalk in front of @entity22 's home			1
@entity10 , a committee member of the @entity11 , @entity12 , said during a radio interview that @entity16 and @entity19 bragged about making the tape the group describes itself as ' a different kind of @entity141 : a grassroots movement that will use traditional media , new media , and direct action to hold senator @entity5 accountable for his failed record			1
' @entity16 has taken the position that he was an innocent bystander , placing the blame squarely on @entity19			0
' @entity16 is completely innocent of any criminal wrongdoing , ' @entity16 attorney @entity149 told @entity151			0
' he is a witness , not a suspect			2
he has fully cooperated with the @entity154 's office for the @entity156 district of @entity38 since the recording became public , ' and has provided ' material assistance to the investigators			2
' that appears consistent with what @entity10 told @entity14 he learned from the men he says made the tape			0
' one of them held the elevator , the other one did the recording and they left , ' @entity10 said			2
@entity22 played jiu - jitsu with his liberal antagonists , turning negative publicity from the damaging recording into a positive fundraising windfall for his campaign @entity22 campaign manager @entity175 said in a statement that ' @entity14 â€™s reports that left - wing activists illegally recorded a private meeting inside our campaign headquarters are very disturbing			2
' sen. @entity22 himself called the apparent wiretapping incident ' nixonian ' in a successful rapid - response fundraising campaign , is ' very disturbing			0
' ' at this point , we understand that the @entity188 is immersed in an intensive criminal investigation , ' he said			0
the @entity188 's @entity15 office declined to make a comment			1
@entity84 magazine , the non-profit liberal magazine that published the recording , may be in legal jeopardy - or in danger of losing its tax - exempt status - if it 's determined that the tape was made illegally			1
it 's a crime in @entity38 to record or publish the contents of a private conversation unless all its participants consent			0
and crossing state lines with such a recording , an @entity188 source told @entity206 on condition of anonymity , is a ' slam - dunk federal case			2
' @entity27 read the vote totals for @entity40 - not @entity18 - during the presidential nomination roll call vote for the @entity12 presidential nomination in 2012 @entity84 is headquartered in @entity213			1
@entity83 , the reporter who broke the story , is based in @entity216 on thursday , @entity18 treasurer @entity217 confirmed to @entity218 that he resigned from the group after the audio recording was made , but before his organization was named publicly in connection with it			1
' i have resigned my position as treasurer and did not and do not condone any allegations of illegal activity that might have taken place , ' he said .			0

one @entity18 founder *fingers* another , claims he was a ' witness '
@entity11 @entity12 officer *fingered* the pair in a @entity15 radio interview
potential suspect was *longtime* @entity12 insider , despite party 's claim it was blindsided by investigation
@entity243 magazine that published recording may have received the *product* of a federal wiretapping *felony*
