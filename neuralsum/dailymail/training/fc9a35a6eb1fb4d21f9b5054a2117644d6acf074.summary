@entity1 gymnast @entity0 has revealed the music for her gold medal - winning floor routine at the @entity4 was a tribute to the victims of the @entity8 terror attack			1
the 18 - year - old said choosing @entity10 - a traditional score used for wedding dances and bat mitzvah - was a response to the @entity14 's failure to mark the 40th anniversary of the tragedy			1
and for @entity0 , from @entity17 , @entity18 , she said it made her gold even more special			1
' i can only imagine how painful it must be for the families and close personal friends of the victims , ' she said			1
' i wanted something the crowd could clap to , especially being here in @entity39			1
' it makes it even much more if the audience is going through everything with you			1
that was really cool and fun to hear the audience clapping			1
' eleven @entity48 athletes were killed during the @entity8 in the now infamous @entity50 terrorist attack			1
only recently it has been revealed @entity52 neo-nazis helped them			2
a campaign was launched by @entity48 officials and the widow of one of the victims for a minute 's silence during the opening ceremony but @entity14 president @entity61 ruled that out			2
president @entity63 also threw his support behind the call for a commemoration of the massacre at the @entity4			2
@entity69 's @entity68 also blasted the decision , saying it was ' insensitive ' and held his own moment of silence when @entity48 athletes marched into the @entity75			2
fitting : @entity0 said : ' that was the best floor performance i 've ever done , and to do it for the @entity4 is like a dream			1
' @entity0 hugs coach @entity80 after winning the gold medal for her floor exercise ( from left ) @entity87 medalist @entity86 's gymnast @entity85 , gold medalist @entity1 gymnast @entity0 and silver medalist @entity91 's gymnast @entity90 after the event @entity0 was shocked when the judges announced her winning score of 15.600 points that made her the first @entity1 woman to strike gold in the @entity99 floor exercise			1
' that was the best floor performance i 've ever done , and to do it for the @entity4 is like a dream , ' @entity0 said			1
rabbi @entity104 , spiritual leader of @entity105 in @entity106 , @entity18 , where the @entity0 family are members , said : ' she is a focused person			1
remember : during the @entity8 , a group of @entity50 terrorist kidnapped and killed much of the @entity48 team in a highly - publicized ordeal @entity113 : @entity114 were killed by the @entity50 black september group it began on the morning of september 5 , 1972 , with six days left in the @entity117 , when eight terrorists stormed the @entity99 village and raided the @entity48 contingent â€™s apartment			2
two @entity48 athletes were killed and nine more were seized as hostages			2
they demanded the release of over 200 @entity50 serving time in @entity48 jails , along with two renowned @entity52 terrorists			2
after a day of unsuccessful negotiations , the terrorists collected the hostages and headed for the military airport in @entity28 for a flight back to the @entity132			2
at the airport , @entity52 sharpshooters opened fire , killing three of the @entity50			2
a horrifying gun battle ensued , claiming the lives of all nine of the hostages and two terrorists on board a helicopter			0
the three surviving assassins were captured , but later released by @entity144 following the hijacking a @entity147 airliner by the @entity148			0
' she 's very proud and upfront about being @entity32			1
neither she nor her family explicitly sought to send a message			0
but it shows how very integrated her @entity32 heritage is in everything that she does			1
' rabbi @entity104 told the @entity35 that he was also stunned by the @entity14 's refusal to hold a moment of silence during the event			0
' i 'm happy to hear any other explanation , ' he said			0
' but short of some racist grudge somebody is holding , i ca n't figure out why it would be a terrible thing to do			0
' the @entity155 said he watched the routine and was blown away			0
' i have to say , the statement just warmed me to the very depths of my being , ' he said			0
he compared it to the iconic black - power , raised - fist protest made by track stars @entity172 and @entity173 on the medal stand at the 1968 @entity117			1
' they 're not going to forget that , ' the rabbi said			0
' i certainly wo n't			0
' eventually , a low - key tribute in front of 100 people was paid at the signing of the @entity182 in @entity39 's @entity183 after the @entity117 opened , the first time it has happened inside an athletes village			0
this was not the first time the @entity14 passed over a moment of silence			0
in the @entity188 held in @entity189 - and largely organised by @entity191 presidential candidate @entity190 - organisers marked the 30th anniversary but did not hold a moment of silence			0
there was also a separate commemoration for the victims of september 11th			0
golden girls : @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity0 and @entity201 of women 's gymnastics show off their medals during coverage of this @entity4 , @entity1 broadcaster @entity69 has sparked anger in the host country after cutting away from the @entity209 when a tribute to the victims of the @entity39 7/7 bombings was shown			1
the station said the tribute to the devastating attack - which killed 52 people and left many with life - changing injuries - ' was n't tailored to a @entity1 audience '			0
