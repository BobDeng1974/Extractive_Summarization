by @entity0 published : 13:28 est , 18 november 2012 updated : 13:37 est , 18 november 2012 it takes a high level of fitness as well as a great deal of focus and dedication to achieve a black belt in taekwondo			1
so you would think that doing it while pregnant would be out of the question			0
but one single mother proved that she had what it took to become one of the few women to gain a fourth degree taekwondo black belt when she was eight months pregnant with her first child			1
girl power : @entity20 trained for her fourth degree taekwondo black belt up until she was eight months pregnant @entity20 , 29 , put herself through a gruelling four - year schedule before gaining the qualification on october 25 this year			1
she said : ‘ it 's such a long training period			0
‘ when i fell pregnant i just thought i will do what i can and keep going until the time comes when i have to stop			2
‘ i styled my training back as it got nearer because sparring would have been silly			0
‘ but you can lower the intensity and still get a lot out of it			0
and exercise during pregnancy is always very important anyway			0
' gruelling : miss @entity20 , 29 , underwent a four - year schedule before she gained the qualification in october this year can you kick it ? miss @entity20 lowered the intensity of her training when she was heavily pregnant but said that exercise during pregnancy is important dedication : the single mother only stopped training when she ' was wobbling up and down ' but continued teaching up until she went into labour the former carnival queen fell pregnant with first son @entity48 , now two - years - old , midway through the training but remarkably , continued with her programme			1
and she only stopped fighting in december 2010 when she was eight months pregnant , one month before she gave birth by emergency caesarean a month later			1
she said : ‘ i got together with my instructor for a @entity55 meal and i decided i had to throw in the towel until i gave birth			2
back to it : the single mother started training again just months after her first child @entity48 was born by caesarian ‘ i was wobbling up and down then			1
but i continued teaching my classes until i went into labour , only calling to cancel the class from the hospital bed			0
the single mother revealed she started training again just months after her first child @entity48 was born and was back to her best within a year			1
miss @entity20 , from @entity67 in @entity68 , added : ‘ after giving birth i had to slowly ease myself into it			2
it was difficult because the whole mentality of taekwondo is to push yourself harder and harder			0
@entity20 , pictured five months pregnant , with lord @entity75 and her instructor @entity76 at a sports promotional event achievement : miss @entity20 pictured with a certificate for her fourth degree taekwondo black belt ‘ i was back teaching after six weeks and it was a couple of months before i was training again			1
‘ i even did n't wear my black belt for a while because i did n't feel i was at that standard			2
' it took me a year to get back and it was a difficult challenge but it was worth it			0
’ miss @entity20 , who teaches taekwondo across the @entity93 , gained the fourth degree , or dan , at an assessment day in @entity97 with 640 other black belt holders this october			1
despite giving birth midway through her training , she recorded the fifth highest score at the event			1
and the single mother , who is also a personal trainer and fitness instructor , revealed that slowing her training before she gave birth might have helped her			2
@entity20 , who started taekwondo aged just 12 and gained her first black belt when she was a student ten years ago , added : ‘ i think lowering the intensity helped enable me to perfect the positions			1
‘ i think it 's done me a lot of good in terms of my skills			0
‘ there 's not many females above fourth degree and one of the reasons for that is child birth			0
‘ a lot of women feel they are not the same after that so stop			0
‘ i meet a lot of mums who lose themselves a bit after having children and i would like them to know that the body is still capable of amazing things			0
‘ i 've got five years until my next degree but i have n't got any plans to have another child at the moment			0
’ in taekwondo , a black belt is not the highest qualification , as further degrees can be given , depending on the amount of time spent training			1
a ninth degree of black belt is the highest achievement but there is no known @entity145 resident with that qualification .			2

@entity20 fell pregnant halfway through four - year training schedule
she stopped her gruelling programme one month before she gave birth
started training again just months after having an emergency caesarian
