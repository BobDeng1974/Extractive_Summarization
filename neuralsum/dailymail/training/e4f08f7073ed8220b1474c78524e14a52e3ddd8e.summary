ocean - going robots are being used in a pioneering science project off the coast of @entity3			1
three innovative machines are tracking tagged fish and monitoring the sea			0
the robo scouts can remain at sea for months using wind , solar and wave power			1
using acoustic ' pingers ' , plaice , sole , brill , and rays are being tracked at sea by the drone boats using acoustic ' pingers ' , plaice , sole , brill , and rays are being tracked at sea by the ocean robots programmed to patrol a large area of the @entity23 are a number of seabed listening stations which work in concert with the ocean robots			1
the three autonomous vehicles – @entity30 , @entity31 and the @entity32 – are all carrying a range of sensors to collect additional data on the physical properties of the ocean , such as water temperature and salinity			0
on - board cameras will also capture valuable photographs and video footage of seabirds and other marine life			0
the three robot boats will spend about two weeks tracking 85 plaice , sole , brill , and rays caught and tagged by the @entity49 and released yesterday			1
the project is the biggest of its kind ever in @entity3 and could herald a new era in ocean exploration as the vehicles are designed to operate remotely across the oceans for months using wind , solar and wave power			1
scientists from the @entity49 ( @entity49 ) in @entity59 , @entity60 , also hope the experiment will shed light on the private lives of some fish species and show whether new protected areas are effective in conserving stocks			1
' this is a pioneering project , ' said @entity68			2
' we have not been able to follow fish in real time at day and night before			0
' remote sensing cuts the cost of marine science at sea by freeing up research vessels manned by scientists , he said			0
the wave - power technology behind @entity80 could also lead to a revolution in marine transport , believes the man who developed the robot			2
although the drone ship is just 3.5 metres long , the technology could be scaled up for a ship , said @entity88 , a director of @entity89 )			2
that would save on fuel costs for ocean transport , he added			0
@entity80 , @entity31 , also @entity3 - built , and @entity94 vessel @entity32 were launched yesterday from @entity96 @entity95 in @entity59 in what is the second phase of the @entity99 project			1
last month five marine robots , including the wave - powered @entity60 craft , proved they could survive gales of up to 70mph as they travelled hundreds of miles gathering data in the @entity106 off the @entity107			0
@entity80 , @entity31 , also @entity3 - built , and @entity94 vessel @entity32 were launched yesterday from @entity96 @entity95 in @entity59 the three autonomous vehicles – @entity30 , @entity31 and the @entity32 – are all carrying a range of sensors to collect additional data on the physical properties of the ocean , such as water temperature and salinity scientists from the mba and technologists from the @entity119 , which has twin sites in @entity121 and @entity122 , are involved			2
the three robot boats will spend about two weeks tracking 85 plaice , sole , brill , and rays caught and tagged by the @entity49 and released yesterday			1
dr @entity129 , of the @entity49 , is leading the project			0
' this technology will give us a new dimension in our understanding of fish movements , residency and migrations in and around the marine protected areas off @entity59			0
the second phase of the project is expected to last until mid-november and follows the highly successful first phase , which saw five marine robots travelling for hundreds of kilometres off the @entity107 to collect ocean and meteorological data			0
the two - phase project is the largest deployment of marine autonomous systems ever seen in the @entity3 and will provide valuable information about the shelf seas , marine life and the scope for autonomous vehicles in future research projects .			1

will help protected species and *spread* new light on *breeding* patterns
biggest project of its in ever carried out the @entity3
plaice , sole , brill , and rays are being tracked
wind , solar and wave power system could be scaled up for ships
