by @entity0 @entity1 will announce that , if elected , he would sharply increase jobless handouts for those who lose their job after working for five years or more older jobless people would get higher unemployment benefits worth as much as £ 100 a week under new @entity8 proposals			1
but the benefit would be scrapped altogether for young adults from middle class families			1
@entity1 will announce today that if elected , he would sharply increase jobless handouts for those who lose their job after working and paying their taxes for five years or more			1
he will argue it is wrong that people who have been in work for just two years before they become jobless get the same rate - £ 71 a week - as someone who has been in work for five , ten or 30 years			1
so a @entity8 government plans to give an extra £ 20 or £ 30 a week more to those who have been in work for longer periods			1
the reform would be paid for by extending the period of time people have to be in work to become eligible for unemployment benefit – from two to perhaps five years			2
at the same time , @entity8 will end entitlement to adult out - of - work benefits for young people aged 18 to 21 and replace them with means - tested support for training			1
those who already have the qualifications they need to secure decent jobs will be excluded			0
around 100,000 young people claiming jobseeker ’s allowance lack basic skills , but are prevented by benefit rules from training while looking for jobs , @entity8 says			1
mr @entity1 wants to make receipt of a new youth allowance – to be means - tested based on parental income – conditional on them entering a training course			1
the means test means 18 - to 21 - year - olds with parents earning above a fixed sum - likely to be around £ 42,000 a year in total household income - will be disqualified from help			2
mr @entity1 will also encourage local authorities to negotiate cheaper rents with landlords by using bulk contracts			1
and under proposals drawn up by the @entity60 think tank , councils would also be able to borrow against housing assets to boost local investment in affordable homes			2
they could set housing benefit levels in their local private rented sectors , would get control over central @entity69 capital housing budget and would be able to set higher rent levels for richer tenants			2
mr @entity1 , speaking at the launch of a report by @entity60 in @entity74 , will say he wants to adopt ‘ @entity76 welfare reforms ’ which rewards those who had worked hardest or were ready to improve their skills without increasing government spending			1
@entity1 will argue it is wrong people who have been in work for just two years before they become jobless get the same rate - £ 71 a week - as someone who has been in work for five , ten or 30 years ( library image ) ‘ we face an economy where inequality is rising , year after year , and where so many people feel locked out of the chances that previous generations enjoyed			1
turning that round is the mission of the next @entity8 government , ’ the @entity8 leader will say			1
‘ and we must do so at a time when our country continues to confront a fiscal situation the like of which we have not seen for generations , the result of a financial crash the like of which none of us have ever seen			0
‘ so we ca n’t just hope to make do and mend and we ca n’t just borrow and spend money to paper over the cracks			0
‘ we must reshape our social security system so that it does everything it can to get people into decent jobs and the world of work not a life on benefits			0
‘ the perversity of the system means that the one thing we most discourage young people from doing is getting the skills they need for a decent career			0
the system is telling them that they should sign on for benefits not sign up for proper training but at the same time , it is saying to those who go to university that they are entitled to financial support			0
@entity129 chairman @entity128 , pictured , said @entity8 had opposed every single welfare reform introduced by the government , including the new £ 26,000 welfare cap ‘ there can be no better example of a divided country which seems to value the 50 per cent of young people who go to university more than the untapped talents of the 50 per cent of young people who do n’t			1
‘ business wo n’t succeed unless we equip them with the skills they need to succeed			0
young people wo n’t succeed unless with the skills they need to succeed			0
and @entity142 wo n’t succeed because it costs the taxpayer billions of pounds in extra welfare spending and lower productivity			0
we need to be @entity76 , not two			0
he will say that , as a first step , @entity8 would introduce a higher rate of @entity149 to those who have contributed over years			1
this , he will say , would be funded by extending the length of time people need to have worked to qualify			0
raising the point of eligibility from two to five years would pay for an increase in the level of contributory @entity149 by £ 20 to £ 30 a week , @entity8 officials said			1
this would mean older people who become unemployed and need to sustain their homes while they seek to return to work			0
‘ it is a principle deeply felt by the @entity142 people that people should get something back for all they have put in and not get something for nothing			0
that ’s why people have such commitment to the idea of a proper basic state pension , so that there can be dignity for working people in retirement			0
’ mr @entity1 will add			2
‘ we will pay for it not by spending more money in social security system overall , but by extending the length of time people need to have worked to qualify			0
’ @entity129 chairman @entity128 said @entity8 had opposed every single welfare reform introduced by the government , including the new £ 26,000 welfare cap			1
‘ this is just a recipe for more spending on welfare , more borrowing – and more taxes to pay for it			0
that ’s exactly how @entity8 got us into a mess in the first place , ’ he added			2
‘ @entity1 has no economic plan			2
all he offers is more of the same old @entity8 , and @entity142 would have a less secure future as a result			2

older jobless to get benefits worth up to £ 100 a week in @entity8 proposals
@entity1 to give extra £ 20 or £ 30 a week to those who *'ve* worked for longer
young adults in middle class families would have benefit scrapped
