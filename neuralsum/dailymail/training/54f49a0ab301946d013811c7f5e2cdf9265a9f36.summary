by @entity0 published : 12:45 est , 21 october 2013 updated : 13:10 est , 21 october 2013 @entity1 - the dolphin who has been taught how to paint			1
@entity4 , 40 , trained the animal to jump out of the water and grasp a paint brush in her mouth			1
also known as ' @entity11 ' , the animal then takes the brush and moves it against a canvas to create her colourful abstract masterpieces			2
she was one of seven animals that mr @entity4 was training - and , according to the man , was the smartest of the bunch			2
mr @entity4 has now moved to work on the @entity29 , while @entity1 remains in @entity24			1
the trainer has also worked with sea lions , penguins , flamingos , and even taught a killer whale to jump and take a fish from his mouth during his long career			1
mr @entity4 said : ' it took a lot of time and effort to teach @entity1 to paint			1
' she was cleverer than the six other dolphins i worked with at the time so i wanted to see if she could learn to hold the paint brush and make her own strokes			1
masterpiece : the animal then uses the brush to create her colourful pieces of art remarkable : mr @entity4 , pictured , says @entity1 often pauses while painting to admire her work ' i was so impressed with the results			1
and she must enjoy it or she would n't have done it			0
' like with humans , there are smart dolphins and stupid dolphins			0
i knew @entity1 was the only one capable of learning what i wanted her to do			0
' i 've seen a lot of others teaching dolphins to paint , but i wanted to push it further and try something different			0
' i wanted to see if she would hold the paintbrush and go to the canvas herself and the result is incredible			0
voila ! @entity1 's final version of the painting is displayed on poolside hobby : mr @entity4 , who has now moved to @entity74 , says he hopes the dolphin will continue to paint regularily ' you can see her stopping between strokes to look at the canvas to see what she 's done			1
' @entity1 even started painting without me rewarding her with fish			2
' the dolphin will now be relocated to @entity86			0
mr @entity4 said : ' chicky the painting dolphin will soon be relocated to one of the marine mammal facilities in @entity86			2
' i do hope to be able to work with her again one day though			0
i am sure she will still enjoy painting again too			0

@entity4 , 40 , taught the animal to jump out of the water and grasp a paint brush in her mouth
@entity1 , who currently lives in @entity24 , then paints on canvas
mr @entity4 , who has also taught a killer whale to jump and take a fish from his mouth , says the process took a long time to *perfect*
' you can see her stopping between strokes to look at the canvas to see what she 's done , ' he says
