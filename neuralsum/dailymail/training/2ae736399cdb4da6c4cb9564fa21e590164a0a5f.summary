campaigners are calling for a ban on a colouring linked to cancer which has been found in @entity4 sold in @entity5			1
a chemical in the caramel colouring that gives the drink its distinctive colour has been at the centre of a health alert in the @entity12			2
@entity4 has recently switched to a new manufacturing process in @entity14 to bring down the level of the suspect chemical , 4 - methylimidazole ( 4 - mi )			2
concern : a chemical found in all @entity4 drinks in the @entity5 is at the centre of a health alert in the @entity12 but this precaution has not yet been taken in other countries such as @entity5 , where its products are the nation ’s biggest selling soft drinks with sales of £ 1.1billion a year			1
the amount of 4 - @entity30 found in regular @entity4 cans sold in @entity5 was 135 micrograms – some 34 times higher than the 4mcg level in the @entity12 , according to research by the @entity12 group @entity34 in partnership with @entity5 ’s @entity36			1
health authorities in @entity38 are so concerned that they have passed a law that requires any can of drink containing a 4 - @entity30 reading of 30mcg or more to carry a health warning			0
if this safety assessment was applied in @entity5 , all cans of @entity4 would have to carry a warning			1
the contaminant results from the industrial process , involving ammonia , that creates the caramel colouring			0
chemical reactions between sugar and the ammonia result in the formation of @entity56 , which has been found to cause cancers in laboratory tests with mice and rats			0
the results of the campaigners ’ research are to be published in the @entity64 , and today they will write to @entity5 health ministers calling for an outright ban on the colouring			1
@entity68 , campaign co-ordinator at the lobby group , said : ‘ @entity4 seems to be treating its @entity5 consumers with disdain			1
the company should respect the health of all of its customers around the world , by using caramel colouring that is free of known cancer - causing chemicals			2
‘ the @entity5 @entity79 must regulate to protect public health from companies that aggressively market sugar - laden drinks that lead to obesity , diabetes and tooth decay			1
’ manufacturers say it is possible to provide a caramel colour that is totally free of @entity56 , however it is four times more expensive			0
the @entity34 examined regular @entity4 from around the world			2
in the @entity12 the 4 - @entity30 level was 4mcg per 355ml			0
the figure was higher in every other country , from 56 in @entity95 to 267 in @entity96			0
@entity97 and @entity98 were not included , but earlier tests suggest they tend to have one third less of the contaminant than the standard drink			0
the @entity103 in @entity38 , which made the warning labels law , said : ‘ studies published in 2007 by the federal government ’s @entity107 showed that long - term exposure to 4 - @entity30 resulted in increases in lung cancer in male and female mice			0
’ recipes : the level of @entity56 in @entity4 in the @entity5 was found to be significantly higher than the version sold in the @entity12 , according to a study @entity38 ’s experts suggest that regular consumption of 4 - mi at its warning label level of 30mcg would cause cancer in one in 100,000 people over their lifetimes			1
@entity4 strenuously denies there is any human health risk from @entity56			1
it said the decision to change the manufacturing process in the @entity12 , made public in march , was to avoid the need to apply ‘ scientifically unfounded ’ health warnings to cans and bottles			0
the @entity5 arm of the company said it will change the caramel colouring used in its drinks in this country , but was unable to put a timescale on @entity139 said : ‘ we intend to expand the use of the reduced 4 - @entity30 caramel globally as this will allow us to streamline and simplify our supply chain , manufacturing , and distribution systems			2
’ the @entity5 @entity146 said there was no need to ban caramel colours containing 4 - @entity30			2
a spokesman said : ‘ the 4 - @entity30 levels found in food and drink products pose no health or safety risks			0
outside the state of @entity38 , no regulatory agency in the world considers the exposure of the public to 4 - @entity30 as present in caramels as an issue			0
’ the spokesman and @entity4 said food safety watchdogs in @entity5 and @entity166 have both decided the presence of 4 - @entity30 in caramel colouring is not a health concern .			1
