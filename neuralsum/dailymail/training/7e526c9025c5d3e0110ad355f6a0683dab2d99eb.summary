living a healthy lifestyle could delay dementia by up to 12 years , according to a landmark @entity3 study			1
heart disease could also be staved off by around six years compared with those who neglect their diet and exercise , said the health specialists			1
the project tracking the lives of 2,500 men for 35 years pinpointed five steps in leading a long and disease - free life which mirror growing evidence about the benefits of healthy living			1
they are : taking regular exercise , not smoking , having a healthy bodyweight , eating a good diet and having a low alcohol intake			1
the study in @entity23 is the longest of its kind to examine the influence of environmental factors in chronic disease			1
from 1979 to the present day , researchers from @entity30 followed the lifestyle habits of men aged 45 - 59 living in the @entity34 area			2
a landmark study carried out in @entity23 over 35 years found living a healthy lifestyle could delay dementia by up to 12 years , while heart disease could be staved off by six years			1
file picture they found that those who followed four or five of the specified healthy steps were 60 per cent less likely to develop dementia			2
there was a similar reduction in the risk of heart attacks and strokes , along with 40 per cent fewer cancers			0
there was also a 70 per cent cut in the risk of diabetes , according to evidence presented yesterday at a @entity53 run by the university			0
professor @entity55 , who has led the @entity57 study since its inception , said the findings were a ‘ wake - up ’ call			0
‘ thirty years ago , only 30 men in our study followed all five of our recommended healthy steps , ’ he said			2
‘ although following these steps does not give them complete protection against disease , the men who , despite living healthily , developed a disease did so at a much older age than the men neglectful of their lifestyle			0
‘ thus the development of heart disease was delayed by up to six years and it was up to around an additional 12 years before dementia took its grip			1
‘ on the less rosy end of the spectrum , 40 men in every 100 lived a life so neglectful that by any definition their lifestyle was unhealthy			0
they experienced none of the reductions in disease			0
’ he added : ‘ the appalling fact is that recent surveys across the whole of @entity92 yield almost identical proportions of men and women following the healthy and unhealthy lifestyles found in @entity34 35 years ago			1
' and the picture is n’t much better in @entity98 : 53 per cent of men drink more than the recommended amount and only half of men meet the government - recommended scores for well - being			0
’ researchers examined a group of 2,500 men , starting in 1979			1
they encourage the participants to take regular exercise , maintain a healthy body weight and refrain from smoking			1
file picture the men taking part were also asked to eat a healthy diet and keep their alcohol intake to a minimum the advice given by the project has become familiar from other research showing that staying slim , eating lots of fruit and vegetables , exercising regularly , drinking in moderation and never smoking boosts longevity			1
the @entity34 participants come from a community where consumption of fruit and vegetables was low , so three or more portions a day was accepted as ‘ healthy ’			0
fat making up less than 30 per cent of calories was classed as a good diet			2
those regarded as physically active were walking two or more miles or cycling ten or more to work each day , or taking ‘ vigorous ’ exercise regularly			0
low alcohol consumption was defined as three or fewer units per day , with abstinence not treated as healthy behaviour			2
@entity140 , of the @entity141 which part - funded the project , said : ‘ these studies are expensive and complicated but essential to understand how dementia can be prevented			0
’ the @entity34 research was a pilot for the much larger @entity148 study involving more than 500,000 @entity3			0
this is led by professor @entity150 , who also works at @entity151 .			0

landmark @entity3 study tracked the lives of 2,500 men for 35 years
researchers asked men to follow a five - step healthy living plan
they were urged to take regular exercise , not smoke , maintain a healthy weight , eat a good diet and have a low alcohol intake
study , which started in @entity23 in 1979 , is longest of its kind to examine the influence of environmental factors in chronic disease
found dementia could be delayed by 12 years and heart disease by six
