waiting for @entity0 @entity1 will understandably be anticipating new signing @entity3 ’s return from the @entity5 next month			1
however it will be interesting to see how manager @entity7 accommodates him in to the team			0
the @entity10 seems happier to build his team around one central striker and – as fearsome as it will be – the @entity3 / @entity14 partnership will perhaps require some tweaking elsewhere in the line - up to make it work			2
@entity3 is currently away in @entity16 with the @entity17 at the @entity5 a city man goes missing @entity20 are a club that still welcome supporters ’ flags and banners but they may wish to consider where they put them			1
two homemade efforts draped over the top tier on sunday were so unfortunately placed that one of @entity20 ’s own slogans read ‘ ... chester thanks you @entity34 ’ and another was reduced to ‘ the only football team to come from …			1
time to strip things back whatever happened to the days when teams played in their most recognisable colours ? @entity41 , we should remind ourselves , are a team that play in red and white			1
on sunday they played a team wearing all blue			2
so what justification for wearing a ‘ change ’ strip that actually constituted more a colour clash than their usual one ? none at all , clearly			0
@entity53 's all blue kit would n't have clashed with @entity41 's red ... so why do they have to wear yellow ? support at all levels @entity20 ’s new @entity57 has had more openings than an envelope but on sunday afternoon was one of which they really should be proud			1
the £ 200m facility was opened to spectators for the first time as @entity67 ’s @entity66 squad took on @entity68 from @entity69			0
it was freezing cold , foggy and then it started snowing			0
but @entity20 got more than 5,000 through the gate			0
@entity73 ... @entity74 ? @entity76 commentator @entity75 suffered a case of mistaken identity yesterday , crediting @entity79 with a header instead of @entity53 team - mate @entity81			2
last week @entity76 pundit @entity82 was forced into making an on - air apology after mixing up @entity79 witwh his colleague @entity84			0
thankfully @entity76 did n’t feel the need this time			0
@entity67 was in the stands at the @entity87 , but earlier had steered the @entity88 to victory hello to old friends the tunnel at the @entity93 is always a cosmopolitan place when these two clubs meet but yesterday there were so many hugs , handshakes and high fives going on in the moments before kick - off that it did n’t do much for the occasion ’ s competitive edge			1
further support , perhaps , for @entity106 ’s pre-match theory on @entity76 that too many of @entity41 ’s players would make ‘ nice son - in - laws ’			0
@entity41 substitute goalkeeper @entity109 and @entity20 keeper @entity110 greet each other in the tunnel			1

@entity3 is away at the @entity5 but @entity53 will be glad to see him arrive in @entity114 after the *tournament*
there were banner *problems* in the home end at the @entity120 are the ' only team to come from ... @entity122 ' apparently
@entity53 played in blue , so why could n't @entity41 wear their home red ?
@entity67 led @entity20 's *development* squad to a win on sunday afternoon
there was a *battle* on the pitch , but hugs all round in the @entity87 tunnel
