four others are now on trial at the @entity42 for either laundering the proceeds or directly assisting with the scam			1

‘ it was a fraud factory , ’ said prosecutor @entity60			2
‘ there were printers , faxes , telephones , bank cards , chequebooks , mobile phones , shredders			0

@entity24 , 26 , was brought into the scam by mastermind @entity9			1
the court heard that @entity24 and his co-defendants must have ' at very least suspected ' that what they were being asked to do was criminal miss @entity60 said : ‘ the case involves a ghost broking website fraud - a website created for the purposes of fraud			1
‘ it is not in dispute that this was a sophisticated fraud and it was masterminded by @entity9			1
‘ he used the four ghost broking websites to carry out car insurance fraud			1
he was responsible for setting up the websites , each of them purporting to offer genuine motor insurance at around a 15 per cent discount below the average price offered by genuine companies			2
‘ unsuspecting members of the public were duped into buying this non-existent car insurance and paying money for it			0
‘ what he identified was he could target innocent members of the public , in particular young first time drivers for whom insurance premiums are extremely high , often inhibitively so			0
’ it is claimed @entity9 recruited @entity110 , 47 , to run the @entity59 fraud from the flat by answering phones and dealing with customer enquiries			1
@entity110 was with @entity9 when police arrived at the flat and acted as a witness to the tenancy agreement , the court heard			1
detectives found a whiteboard featuring the names of nine invented employees next to their roles in claims , admin and compliance , it is claimed			2

detective chief inspector @entity130 is in fact head of the @entity139			2
’ police also found an @entity33 connected to sound system with only one track uploaded titled ‘ @entity32			0
’ ‘ officers listened to the track through the speaker system and what they heard being played was a busy working office , the sound of ringing phones , a call centre effect			0
’ jurors heard @entity110 is likely to claim he was an innocent dupe and was led to believe this was a genuine business			0
‘ @entity155 can not have failed to be aware that something was amiss , ’ said @entity154			0
' using a name that was n’t his has to have alerted him to the fact this was a fraudulent enterprise			0

‘ once these were opened @entity9 would take over control of the accounts to enable him to access the money , ’ said @entity154			1
‘ these three men may not have known it was a car insurance fraud specifically but what the @entity175 say is that at the time they opened bank accounts they did so in circumstances such that it can safely have been inferred they must have known or at the very least suspected they were doing it for criminal purposes			0
’ @entity23 is said to have received proceeds from the @entity51 and @entity52 between may and august 2011			0
@entity26 and @entity24 are said to have received the proceeds from the @entity187 insurance fraud between august 2011 and january 2012			2
