@entity1 whistleblower @entity0 has defended his disclosure of top - secret @entity4 spying programs in an online chat as he attacks president @entity6 over his broken promises			1
as he answered readers ' questions online , @entity0 lambasted @entity4 officials for calling him a traitor and said the government wo n't silence him by ' jailing or murdering ' him			1
' the @entity15 is not going to be able to cover this up by jailing or murdering me , ' he said in the live chat , which was launched on monday			1
' truth is coming , and it can not be stopped			2
' the @entity21 hosted the online chat with @entity0 , who has been in hiding in @entity23 since fleeing the @entity4 , as reporter @entity24 received and posted @entity0 's answers			1
speaking out : @entity0 is taking part in a live web chat , where he is defending leaking information among his responses , he said he waited until after the election to release the information as he had been hopeful that @entity6 would make good on his promises about civil liberties			1
in fact , @entity0 said , privacy and civil liberties have actually worsened since the re-election			1
' shortly after assuming power , [ @entity6 ] closed the door on investigating systemic violations of law , deepened and expanded several abusive programs , and refused to spend the political capital to end the kind of human rights violations like we see in @entity47 , where men still sit without charge , ' he said			1
he said he saw no option but the flee the country as the administration would never have given him a fair trial			2
' the @entity15 , just as they did with other whistleblowers , immediately and predictably destroyed any possibility of a fair trial at home , openly declaring me guilty of treason , ' he said			2
' that 's not justice			2
' but @entity0 added that he did not think it was too late - that the leaks gave the president a chance ' for a return to sanity , constitutional policy , and the rule of law rather than men '			1
connection : @entity0 is responding via @entity24 , the @entity21 reporter who broke the story on his escape to @entity23 : ' the @entity15 immediately and predictably destroyed any possibility of a fair trial at home ... that 's not justice			1
it would be foolish to volunteer yourself to it if you can do more good outside of prison than in it			2
' on leaking information about the @entity4 tracking foreign countries : ' @entity87 has n't declared war on the countries but without asking for public permission , @entity1 is running network operations against them that affect millions of innocent people			2
and for what ? so we can have secret access to a computer in a country we 're not even fighting ? ' on being silenced : ' the @entity4 government is not going to be able to cover this up by jailing or murdering me			1
' on why he leaked the information : ' @entity6 's campaign promises gave me faith that he would lead us toward fixing problems			1
unfortunately , he closed the door on investigating systemic violations of law , deepened and expanded several abusive programs , and refused ... to end human rights violations			2
' on beating @entity1 surveillance : ' encryption works			2
properly implemented strong crypto systems are one of the few things that you can rely on			0
unfortunately , endpoint security is so terrifically weak that @entity1 can frequently find ways around it			0
' on spying for @entity123 : ' ask yourself : if i were a @entity123 spy , why would n't i have flown directly into @entity126 ? i could be living in a palace petting a phoenix by now			2
' on when he decided to act : ' there was no single moment			0
it was seeing a continuing litany of lies from senior officials to @entity87			0
' he called for @entity6 to set up a special committee to review the surveillance programs and set up a special investigator to review presidents ' policies for wrongdoing			1
he added that he did not reveal any @entity4 operations against what he called legitimate military targets , but instead showed that the @entity1 is hacking civilian infrastructure like universities and businesses			0
@entity4 officials say the data - gathering programs were legal and operated under court supervision			0
@entity0 explained his claim that from his desk , he could ' wiretap ' any phone call or email - a claim top intelligence officials have denied			1
' if an @entity1 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , etc. analyst has access to query raw @entity163 ( signals intelligence ) databases , they can enter and get results for anything they want , ' he said			0
' phone number , email , user id , cell phone handset id ( @entity174 ) , and so on - it 's all the same			0
' director of national intelligence @entity175 has said that the kind of data that can be accessed and who can access it is severely limited			0
his online chat comes after @entity123 denied that @entity0 is working for them after former @entity4 vice-president @entity182 branded the leaker a ' traitor and possible @entity123 spy '			1
@entity187 spokeswoman @entity186 said at a daily briefing today , ' this is sheer nonsense , ' when asked if @entity0 worked for @entity123			1
@entity0 himself added in the web chat : ' ask yourself : if i were a @entity123 spy , why would n't i have flown directly into @entity126 ? i could be living in a palace petting a phoenix by now			1
' several nations , including @entity4 allies , have reacted angrily to revelations by the @entity200 employee that @entity4 authorities had tapped the servers of internet companies for personal data			0
national defense : former vice president @entity182 spoke on @entity206 sunday in @entity207 about the need for surveillance ' we believe the @entity4 should pay attention to the international community 's concerns and demands and give the international community the necessary explanation , ' @entity186 said			0
the @entity123 government has previously not commented directly on the case , simply repeating the government 's standard line that @entity123 is one of the world 's biggest victims of hacking attacks			2
a senior source with ties to the @entity228 leadership said @entity126 was reluctant to jeopardise recently improved ties with @entity207			0
@entity182 said how the controversial surveillance methods used by the @entity1 could have prevented the september 11 attacks and said the revelations have done ' enormous damage ' to @entity4 's security			0
speaking on @entity206 sunday with @entity235 , @entity182 took credit for crafting the program of data collection , saying that he ' worked with [ former director of national intelligence ] @entity240 when we set this program up			0
' ' traitor ' : according to @entity182 , @entity0 could be leaking @entity4 security secrets to @entity123			1
supporters in @entity23 have come out strongly in defense of the former @entity160 employee , as pictured ' as everybody who 's been associated with the program 's said , if we had had this before 9/11 , when there were two terrorists in @entity254 - two hijackers - had been able to use that program , that capability , against that target , we might well have been able to prevent 9/11 , ' @entity182 told @entity235			0
in the webchat , @entity0 added : ' journalists should ask : since these programs began operation shortly after september 11th , how many terrorist attacks were prevented solely by information derived from this suspicion-less surveillance that could not be gained via any other source ? ' then ask how many individual communications were ingested to acheive that , and ask yourself if it was worth it			1
' @entity182 ridiculed the notion that the @entity1 was listening in to personal calls of ordinary @entity4			0
' the allegation is not that we get all this personal information on @entity276 or @entity235 , that 's not the way it works , ' he said			0
anger : @entity0 said civil liberties had worsened ever since president @entity6 was re-elected last year ' what information [ was collected ] ? ' he said			1
' and the answer is phone numbers and who contacted who			0
but we do n’t have any names associated with it			0
it ’s just a big bag of numbers that ’s been collected			0
' of @entity0 , @entity182 said the breach of security was one of the worst in history			1
' i think he 's a traitor			0
i think it 's one of the worst occasions , in my memory , of somebody with access to classified information doing enormous damage to the national security interests of the @entity4 , ' he said			0
he suggested that @entity0 , who is thought to have fled to @entity23 , could be working with the @entity123 government			1
' i am very , very worried that he still has additional information that he has n't released yet , that the @entity123 would welcome the opportunity and are probably willing to offer immunity - or sanctuary , if you will - in exchange for what he presumably knows or does n't know , ' said @entity182 .			2
