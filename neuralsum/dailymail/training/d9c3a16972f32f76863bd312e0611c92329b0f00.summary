a disabled man with the mental age of seven has been barred from his regular visits to @entity3 with his carer because of ' child protection ' fears			1
@entity7 , 40 , who has cerebral palsy , autism and a mental age of seven , has been told his annual pass to the @entity13 - based attraction will not be renewed			1
@entity14 say they have a policy of refusing entry to adults without children and have defended their decision to turn away mr @entity7 , who was accompanied by an adult carer			1
mr @entity7 's sister , @entity29 , 41 , from @entity30 , in @entity13 , bought the Â£ 60 annual pass for her brother last year after explaining his condition to staff			1
but after seven months of weekly visits to the attraction in the @entity37 mr @entity7 was told he was no longer welcome due to ' child protection '			2
he was instead offered a pass for alternative venues run by parent group @entity41 elsewhere in the @entity42			0
when miss @entity44 argued this was unfair , management said they would honour the last five months on the pass but it would not be renewed			0
the family also now have to email in advance before he can visit			0
and in another case , a 20 - year - old man with learning disabilities and his carer were also refused entry			1
the @entity14 , pictured , has a policy of not allowing adults to visit if not accompanied by a child @entity58 's son @entity57 , 20 , who has @entity59 and the mental age of six , was also turned away when he tried to visit this week			1
mr @entity62 's carer was also told adults without children were not allowed entry			1
the mother , from @entity67 , @entity68 , said : ' the ridiculous thing is @entity7 would be allowed in if he went with a child - but neither would be able to look after each other			2
' he just wants to go and play with the @entity73 and look at the models			0
' @entity75 , activism lead at charity @entity77 , also slammed the decision			0
she said : ' it is unfortunate @entity81 's policy has had a negative effect on someone with a learning disability who wanted to go out and access leisure activities many people take for granted			0
@entity88 , pictured with his sister @entity29 , 41 , had been visiting the attraction on a weekly basis for seven monthswhen he was told he was no longer welcome the attraction , aimed at three to 10 year olds , features 4d cinema , laser ride , driving school , and offers workshops with master builders			0
it states on the @entity101 website that adults must be accompanied by children to visit			2
but a spokesman for @entity14 said : ' our policy not to permit entry to groups of adults , adult couples , or lone adults , regardless of circumstances , who are not accompanied by a child or children under the age of 16 is we believe therefore appropriate and the best way to constantly maintain a welcoming environment for our young visitors			1
@entity62 , 20 , who has @entity59 and the mental age of six , was also refused entry to the attraction ' we make no apologies for this policy and believe it to be reasonable and appropriate , and one on which we make no exceptions			1
' that said , we also very much appreciate the continuing appeal that @entity73 has for all ages , and it has never been our intention to deny access to our adult fans , or cause distress to anyone			0
' that is why we regularly host evening events specifically for adults in order to showcase specific attractions within the centre and these are very well attended			2
@entity142 's mother @entity58 said her son , ' just wants to go and play with the @entity73 and look at the models ' ' we hope very much that all adult guests will join us at one of these sessions and we are sure that he would very much enjoy it			0
' however if an evening event is difficult for him to attend then if his family make contact we would be happy to agree a time when one of our managers is available to show him around			0
