by @entity0 published : 19:48 est , 26 october 2012 updated : 20:01 est , 26 october 2012 the telescope has come a long way since its humble origins in the 17th century			2
the world ’s largest telescope is due to be completed in march and can already capture far more than one of the first ones invented by @entity8 that saw sunspots and valleys on the surface of the moon			2
the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) in @entity15 ’s @entity13 desert reaches farther beyond @entity17 's skies than any other radio telescope and has already captured incredible images different from anything seen before by visible - light and infrared telescopes			1
remote : the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) in @entity15 's @entity13 desert is one of the world 's largest astronomy projects when finished , it will be up to ten times sharper than @entity28 ’s @entity27			1
even now , @entity13 can already show the detailed structures of clouds of cold gases and debris that only look like ink stains with other telescopes			1
@entity35 , @entity13 ’s instrument group manager , said : ‘ what surprises me is what is being observed			1
until now , we have n't had such a capable observatory			0
‘ we 've never been able to observe with such resolution , such accuracy			0
’ many parts make up a whole : when completed , 66 radio antennae will combine as a single giant telescope pointing skyward			2
so far , 43 have been set up @entity46 : the telescope captured this incredible image of a pair of distorted colliding spiral galaxies about 70 million light - years away , in the constellation of @entity52 ( @entity53 ) @entity13 has even been able to detect sugar molecules in the gas surrounding a star about 400 light years away			1
it is the telescope ’s location in one of the harshest places on earth that makes this possible			2
the 16,400 - foot ( 5,000 - metre ) altitude , thin air and mercurial climate in the @entity13 desert can be unbearable			1
visitors must breathe oxygen from a tank just to keep from fainting while winds reach 62 mph ( 100 km ) and temperatures drop to 10 below zero ( minus 25 degrees @entity71 )			0
the telescope has also revealed a never before seen unexpected spiral structure in the material around an old star close up : the radio antennas pick up wavelengths of light longer than anything visible to the human eye for astronomers , however , the lack of humidity , low interference from other radio signals and closeness to the upper atmosphere combine to make this the perfect spot for the telescope			0
jointly funded and managed by the @entity91 , @entity92 , the @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 , the $ 1.5 billion project is an engineering triumph that launches @entity15 , already home to some of the world 's largest optical telescopes , to the forefront of ground - based space exploration			1
@entity103 , a @entity104 astronomy professor said : ‘ we 're talking about the @entity106 of astronomy joined for a billion dollar adventure			1
‘ scientists are like kids playing with very expensive toys and these ones are technological developments that could change the world			0
’ the telescope will consist of 66 radio antennae , 43 of which have already been set up as a single giant telescope pointing skyward			0
inhospitable : the telescope is being built in @entity15 's @entity119 at an altitude of 16,400 - feet			1
temperatures plummet at night and winds reach 62mph when finished , the telescope will be up to ten times sharper than @entity28 's @entity27 test run : a transporter truck lifts a box that weighs as much as an antenna , as part of a transport test			1
the trucks travel 22 miles over five hours to reach the plateau @entity13 's parts are shipped from all over the world and assembled at a warehouse 9,514 feet ( 2,900 meters ) above sea level			1
the dishes are hauled up to their final destination by two custom - made 28 - wheel transporters that travel 22 miles over five hours to reach the plateau			0
each antenna is perched on a rotating steel pedestal with precisely installed copper lining to protect from lightning			0
the structures , 40 feet ( 12 - meter ) tall , lean closer together or farther apart as astronomers zoom in or get wider views			1
the @entity13 correlator is the fastest computer ever used at an astronomical site			2
@entity13 's parts are shipped from all over the world and assembled at a warehouse 9,514 feet above sea level hard at work : astronomer @entity154 , ( left ) , engineer @entity155 , ( centre ) , and array operator @entity157 work at the @entity159 a board covered by scientists ' notes hangs in the @entity159			1
as many as 500 people at a time live at 9,500 feet above sea level as many as 500 people at a time live at 9,500 feet above sea level in shipping containers modified as trailers			0
alcohol is banned due to the sensitivity of the equipment , and those caught drinking after trips to the nearby city of @entity13 must sleep at the security checkpoint while they sober up			2
their shifts can last 12 hours daily for eight straight days			0
@entity179 astronomer @entity178 , who works at the site , explained : ‘ this project has to do with the origin of our life and our future			0
' it 's about how can we predict our future climates , the evolution of the earth , the sun , our species			0
' we know more about our universe , our culture , than we ever dreamt of 100 years ago			0
our prediction is that the real surprises here will come with things that we ca n't even begin to imagine			0

the telescope already captured images different from anything seen before
it will be ten times sharper than @entity28 's @entity27
the 1.5 billion - dollar project is located at 16,400 - feet in the @entity13 desert
