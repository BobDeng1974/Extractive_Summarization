nine days on from his @entity1 success and @entity3 says he has already moved on			1
‘ rather than reflect on it and enjoy it , i want to use it as a springboard , ’ he said			2
‘ yes , it ’s going to be great to be introduced as the @entity1 champion but that ’s not all i want to be this year			1
i ’ve got a lot more things i want to achieve			2
’ two more goals will move instantly into view when the driven @entity16 plays in his first tournament since his stirring victory at @entity20 at the @entity21 , which begins at @entity22 on thursday			1
‘ i can also become world no 1 again if i win , and that ’s definitely on my list			2
’ naturally , it ’s not all work			0
there ’s still been time for back - slapping and story swapping with his peers on the practice ground			2
‘ @entity52 was telling me when he won the @entity53 he took the @entity54 to this bar and became a bit nervous when everyone started drinking out of it , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ i could n’t have done that			0
i took the @entity25 to this bar in @entity61 on the monday with my mates and i must admit i did find myself watching where it was going			1
i did n’t want it going beyond the people i trust			0
’ @entity3 spent the rest of the week working on his fitness in @entity69 and fulfilling some sponsorship obligations before returning with the jug to his home in @entity73 last friday			1
‘ i ’ve taken a photo of it on top of the television , on top of the toilet , silly things like that and sending the pictures to my friends , ’ he said , smiling			0
‘ it ’s just nice to have it in my possession			0
’ old friends : the three - time @entity89 winner consoles his friend @entity90 after the final round of @entity1 picturesque : @entity3 looked comfortable throughout his four rounds on his way to victory after winning his first major , the @entity96 , in 2011 @entity3 admitted he could happily have taken the rest of the year off			1
‘ it was such a relief after what had happened at the @entity100 ( he lost a four - shot lead heading into the final round ) , ’ he said			2
‘ winning the @entity53 the following year definitely felt different			2
the @entity104 were on , there were a lot of great sports stories around , and i felt like i do now , that i wanted to get out there and win some more			2
‘ going home after winning @entity1 , though , i certainly feel like my fame has gone up a notch			1
we ’ve got social media now and so your whole life is out there			0
but it wo n’t deflect me from my main objectives			0
’ reach for the sky : after his @entity96 win in 2011 , @entity3 admitted feeling like taking a year off from golf asked if it was possible to live a normal life and still be so intent on winning majors , @entity3 responded : ‘ i never grew up wanting to live a normal life			1
i wanted to win majors			2
but i still think you can sort of do both			0
i can still do relatively normal things , and it ’s not going to be difficult for me to stay hungry			0
’ only once in his life did @entity3 lose his appetite for the game			1
he explained , laughing : ‘ i was 16 , i ’d just won the @entity133 and i was driving home with my dad and said to him : “ i do n’t think i like this anymore			1
” ‘ three days later , i said to him : “ i like it again now			0
” i guess i was just a grumpy teenager going through some hormonal issues			0
’ advisory role : @entity3 thinks @entity143 should stay as @entity145 's assistant captain for the @entity146 @entity3 was asked about the possibility of @entity143 playing in september ’s @entity146 at the age of 57 and , typically , did n’t duck the question			1
‘ i think the dynamic in the team room is just great right now , ’ he said			0
‘ he ’d be a great assistant captain but i do n’t think he should play			0
’ it ’s a curious thing that @entity3 ’s two victories this year have come at @entity155 , a venue he does n’t like , and at a links that is not supposed to suit his game			1
now he ’s at @entity22 , where he has had three top - five finishes in five starts , followed by the season ’s final major , the @entity53 at the similarly constructed @entity162			1
‘ they ’re definitely two courses that should suit me and i ’ve got a lot of faith in my game , so let ’s see what happens , ’ he said			0
‘ let ’s see if i can ride this momentum			0

the 25 - year - old won his third @entity89 title at @entity20 earlier in july
@entity3 insists he has already moved on from that win and is *focused* on adding more *silverware* to his trophy cabinet
his first tournament since @entity20 is at @entity22 , starting on thursday
@entity3 has not won a @entity39 , despite three @entity89 wins
the @entity16 spent the week after his @entity1 win working on his fitness in @entity69 before returning to his @entity73 home with the @entity25
@entity3 feels his fame has gone up a notch since the triumph at @entity20
