my father was white and my mother looked white but her grandmother was black and she passed those genes on to us in varying degrees			2

he certainly was n’t what you would call handsome but he had a twinkle in his eye			0
@entity6 , second right , pictured with daughter @entity2 , @entity65 @entity64 , left , and husband @entity66 ‘ one day he came in and i served him as usual but after he left , i noticed there was a letter on the counter addressed to me			1
i opened it and there was yards and yards of it			0
‘ it started off lovey - dovey enough but before long it had turned into something of a political missive all about how he was going to free the blacks in our country			2
‘ then @entity40 came in and saw me reading the letter			0
she asked who it was from and i told her			0
' she snatched it out of my hands and threw it on the fire , saying i was n’t going to be going out with any black men			0
’ @entity6 never saw @entity5 again			1
soon afterwards , he moved for good from @entity13 , now called @entity13 , a former military post for colonial forces , to @entity93 where he continued his political struggle			0
@entity6 aged 16 , when @entity5 pledged his undying love she continued : ‘ i wish i still had the letter			1
‘ imagine what it might have told us today about how @entity5 predicted what lay ahead for him and his country			1
it would have been a special piece of history			0
‘ all i ’ve got left are the memories and the endless jokes from my eventual husband and children about what might have been			0
i know he was a bit of a ladies ’ man in later life and it would seem he might have been then , too			0
’ little did @entity6 know at the time that @entity5 was already married to @entity114 , with whom he had three children : @entity116 , @entity117 , who died aged just nine months , and @entity118 , born in 1951 – the year of the love note			1

about a year after arriving , she was gardening at the front of the house when a local boy , @entity138 , strolled past and persuaded her to go to the cinema instead of the square dance she had planned			0
@entity6 said : ‘ i was all dressed up in my check shirt and denim trousers but something told me to go			2
i was supposed to be going off travelling in @entity144 and he had a job lined up in @entity147			0
‘ we never looked back , though			0
we married in 1954 and i ’m proud to say i found the right one for me			0
@entity66 gave me four lovely children , the first of whom was @entity152			0
’ @entity2 , now 57 , was famously married to @entity65 @entity64 for 26 years and has just published a new memoir – hey @entity2			2
