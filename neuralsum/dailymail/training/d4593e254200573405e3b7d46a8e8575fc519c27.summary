hundreds of copies have already been snapped up , with each month showing the imposing @entity26 buildings which became home to schizophrenics , epileptics and the feeble - minded			1
@entity3 said : ' i drove around the country to find the insane asylums which were the most notorious			1
' it is a controversial subject so i only featured institutions which are no longer in use any more			1

@entity80 ’s asylum in @entity81 , @entity82 , is the image for july and was charged with providing healthcare for ' insane ' paupers living in workhouses			1
august offers the @entity87 at @entity88 , built in the 1890 ’s by @entity89 to relieve over-crowing in other institutions , while september shows a terrifying collection of images from the creepy @entity93 in @entity94 , @entity95			2

@entity48 's @entity115 features in october and november 's offering is @entity117 in @entity54 - where dr @entity118 began pioneering work in the psychiatric use of @entity121			2

abandoned : september and a terrifying collection of images from the creepy @entity93 in @entity94 , @entity95 asylum : october shows the pauper wing at @entity137 in @entity48 bleak : the @entity117 in @entity54 provides november 's haunting image festive : the white bricks of @entity126 in @entity127 provide december 's image eccentric : @entity3 has previously released calendars featuring roundabouts , pictured , roadkill and prisons many former asylums have been converted into homes , such as the former @entity149 in @entity150 , @entity151 @entity26 asylums were hailed as places of refuge for some of society ’s supposedly most vulnerable men and women			1
these buildings were called ‘ lunatic asylums ’ , and later renamed ‘ mental hospitals ’			2
they earned a reputation as dehumanising , prison - like institutions			2
before asylums , the burden of keeping vulnerable individuals rested almost entirely on loved ones			0
‘ mad ’ people who could not be kept at home wandered free , begging for food and shelter			0
a growing market economy in the 1600s and 1700s saw ‘ service professions ’ emerge			0
those who worked in them did thankless jobs formerly handled at home or by the church , and included undertakers , private tutors and ‘ madhouse - keepers ’			0
families paid for secrecy and discretion , and private ‘ madhouses ’ left few records			0
artefacts show keepers used physical restraints such as leg - irons and manacles			0
public funding poured into asylum construction between 1800 and 1900			0
the patient population in @entity198 went from about 10,000 to 10 times that			1
asylums built in this period impressed public officials , as the buildings were designed to be majestic and therapeutic			0
@entity205 attention was paid to ventilation and to safety , and most asylums also featured extensive grounds			0
expensive but inflexible buildings became overcrowded , and by 1890 the majority of patients left only in coffins			0
techniques such as straitjackets , seclusion and sedative drugs such as bromides were used on unruly patients			0
in the first half of the 1900s asylums ( or ‘ mental hospitals ’ ) became testing grounds for controversial treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy ( @entity226 ) and lobotomy			0
these methods helped some patients function again , but they irreparably harmed others			0
many mental hospitals closed in the 1970s and 1980s			0
this was due to pressure from the anti-psychiatry movement , feminist criticism , ex-patient activism and political suspicion of large , unaccountable institutions			0
