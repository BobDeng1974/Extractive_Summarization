behind the scenes the discreet @entity0 has long been one of the most powerful women in football			1
but now the @entity5 is set to become even more influential as she is tipped to take over as @entity8 's chief executive at the age of just 39 , following the surprise resignation of previous ceo @entity11			1
her glamorous good looks will inevitably draw comparisons with the outspoken , perfectly groomed ' first lady of football ' and @entity15 star @entity15			2
but anyone ready to dismiss ms @entity17 as merely a pretty face should be aware of a core of steel behind the megawatt smile			1
@entity0 has long been one of the most powerful women in football			1
now that @entity8 's chief executive @entity11 is leaving the club , she is hotly tipped to be named incoming ceo the @entity26 and @entity5 national has been hotly tipped to be named incoming @entity8 ceo in a move which will come as little surprise to those who have been following her breathtaking ascent from humble @entity33 to the ' voice of @entity35 '			1
she has been the most trusted member of the oligarch 's inner circle for 17 years and is already often described as ' chief executive in everything but title ' , his ' eminence grise '			0
born in @entity5 , at school there was little indication of her future as a powerhouse in the footballing world with one former teacher describing her as a ' grey mouse '			1
' i remember teaching her , but do n't recall anything outstanding about @entity0 , ' said the teacher			1
' it 's interesting how she has made such a successful career in sport in @entity58			0
' she studied at a @entity61 school which specialised in music and dance , in which there were compulsory lessons , but at the time offered pupils no sport			0
she graduated six months after the collapse of the @entity70 , and studied in the @entity71 of @entity72 before leaving with honours in 1997 , and starting her career at @entity75 , the oil company which was then owned by @entity35 ,			1
since she moved from the @entity5 capital to @entity58 when he bought @entity8 in 2003 , the billionaire is said to have grown to trust her implicitly			1
indeed , her position at his right hand is so secure that she often takes his place at meetings , delivers his messages and is said to have the speediest access to him			2
she is known to be charming and polite , but ruthlessly firm by those who have met her			0
just ask @entity8 captain @entity88 - who was told in no uncertain terms to ' take it or f * * * * * * leave it ' when trying to renegotiate his contract with 39 - year - old @entity17			1
@entity17 pictured with chairman @entity94 and @entity11 as they watch @entity97 field media questions on his return to manage @entity8			1
she was said to be integral to the decision her biggest coup so far has been engineering the return to the club of @entity97 , the @entity103 manager who was dubbed ' @entity97 ' during his first spell as @entity8 manager between 2004 and 2007			2
despite his success , he was sacked after falling out with @entity35 - but ms @entity17 apparently kept in constant touch with him , and last year was crucial in sealing the deal to bring him back from @entity112			1
the manoeuvre was typical of her understated style , being just one of a string of delicate negotiations which she has carried out behind the scenes			0
a source at the club told the @entity122 : ' she is basically the power at @entity8			2
she 's not interested in being a celebrity but there is no doubt who 's in charge and who call the shots			0
' it is symbolic of her role that she was crucial in getting @entity134 ( @entity97 ) back			0
he had fallen out with @entity35 in very acrimonious and public circumstances and received a massive pay - off			1
' it would have been very egg on face for @entity35 to bring him back even though the fans and players were calling for it			2
she was the one who said ' let 's bring him back ' and was the driving force behind the move			0
and it 's paid off big time			0
while she was key to @entity97 's return it is ms @entity17 who is often said to be @entity35 's true ' special one ' , engineering big - money transfers such as @entity157 's Â£ 32million move from @entity158 and driving meetings at @entity160 or at the club 's training ground in @entity163			1
she seems happy to pose with players in the rare pictures which can be found of her online			0
it is perhaps the fact that little is known of ms @entity17 that so endears her to the private @entity35			1
sports websites in her native @entity5 call her ' an absolutely non-public person ' , adding ' in that sense , she 's similar to @entity35			1
' @entity8 player @entity175 with @entity17 during the @entity176 at @entity178 restaurant in @entity179 in 2010			1
she seems happy to pose with players in the rare pictures found of her online while outspoken @entity182 vice-chairman @entity15 proudly touts herself as sporting executive , television broadcaster , newspaper columnist , author and novelist , search for @entity17 on social media , and all you will find is a fiercely locked down @entity192 account , set up in 2007			1
it tells us that she studied at a @entity61 school called 1113 , a well regarded establishment dedicated to the arts			0
she also lists her association with @entity199 , a @entity200 holding company set up in 2001 to manage @entity35 's assets			1
the page also shows that she is a fan of annual @entity203 and the restaurant @entity205 - which caters for the vip boxes at @entity8			1
@entity207 and head chef @entity208 , told @entity209 last year : ' she 's an amazing person			0
she 's so professional , she knows what she wants			0

any small problem i contact her with , she deals with it on top of everything else she has on her shoulders			0
' she is fluent in @entity232 and speaks several other @entity234 languages , and is said to be one of the primary architects behind @entity8 's youth scheme - by taking young talent and sending them on loan to develop			1
and while mr @entity11 turned his attention towards the commercial end of the business , ms @entity17 became the pivotal figure in transfer and contract negotiations - a far more familiar face around @entity249			1
agents heading to the bridge or the club 's training ground in @entity163 were often met by < s @entity17 , driving the meetings , increasingly active and influential at the heart of the club with a good relationship with technical director @entity258			1
