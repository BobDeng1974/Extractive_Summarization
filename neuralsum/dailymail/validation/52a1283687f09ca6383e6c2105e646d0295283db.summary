you may think you ’re making a healthy decision when opting for a bowl of cereal over a bacon sandwich but a new survey has uncovered the staggering amount of sugar in some of the most popular @entity9 brands			1
just right , which is marketed as ‘ low in salt			0
goodness of wholegrain ’ contains a shocking seven teaspoons of sugar per 100 grams			1
it ’s ‘ healthy ’ counterparts in the cereal aisle such as @entity19 contain eight teaspoons of sugar , while @entity23 and be natural @entity21 and @entity22 both boast five and a half			1
in fact , the average sugar content of all 20 cereals analysed by the @entity40 was 19.8g per 100g – that ’s almost 20 per cent sugar , about five teaspoons of the dangerous ingredient			1
children ’s cereals are , less surprisingly , also packed full of sugar			2
chocolate covered @entity49 which are advertised as ‘ nutritious grains of puffed rice with cocoa ’ contain a sickening nine teaspoons of sugar per 100 grams , as well as 465 mg of sodium			1
while @entity55 boasts nine and a half teaspoons of sugar , despite being labelled promisingly as ‘ no artificial flavours , no artificial colours ’			0
in the children 's aisle , @entity19 contains eight teaspoons of sugar and colourful @entity55 has nine and a half frosties , which do n't have any health claims , contain ten teaspoons of sugar per 100 grams – highlighting that they should probably only be eaten as a treat			1
the @entity69 ( @entity69 ) recommends no more than 10 per cent of a person 's daily energy should come from free sugars - those that are added to processed foods and drinks , but also those found naturally in honey , syrups and fruit juices			0
that equates to around 50g or 10 cubes a day - easily reached with a bottle of fizzy drink			0
however , the @entity85 agency advises that people aim for no more than five per cent - 25g or around six teaspoons - to achieve the biggest health benefits			0
yet many of us are consuming way in excess of this just in our first meal of the day – cereal			0
@entity93 and @entity22 , which advertises itself as ' no artificial flavours , colours or preservatives ' , has five and a half teaspoons of sugar per 100 grams			2
frosties , which do n't have any health claims , contain ten teaspoons of sugar per 100 grams the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) says its findings suggest @entity9 cereal manufacturers are potentially misleading consumers by promoting healthy sounding statements on their packaging despite sugar making up more than 35 per cent of the ingredients of some popular brands			1
executive manager of the @entity40 @entity110 said : ‘ many breakfast cereals contain high levels of sugar , but manufacturers use all sorts of creative phrases on their labels to give consumers the impression they ’re a nutritious choice for breakfast			1
it ’s as though they are prepared to tell consumers only half the story			0
‘ many parents would be horrified to learn that for every three mouthfuls of @entity19 , one is just sugar , while a small bowl contains twice as much sodium as a small packet of chips			0
’ @entity32 only has 3.5 teaspoons of sugar but it has 490 mg of sodium , making it ' high ' in salt			2

the system helps consumers better understand a product ’s overall health rating so they can make informed choices , but our research has revealed very few cereals , as yet , carry the star label , ’ ms @entity110 said			0
‘ clearer labelling through such a system is a vital step in helping consumers make healthier choices in an environment where approximately 63 per cent of @entity9 adults and 25 per cent of @entity9 children are overweight or obese			2
