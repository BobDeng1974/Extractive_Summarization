on the up : @entity16 authorities were keen to point out the country , of which @entity84 , pictured , is the capital , were booming not @entity16 : the country 's authorities insisted @entity16 was not @entity25 , pictured , but instead a thriving , vibrant economy setting the record straight : the @entity6 was quick to react to @entity4 ' tweet , with a tweet of their own , stating that the country was actually booming ' we are not annoyed with mr @entity4 , it 's not at all that			1
