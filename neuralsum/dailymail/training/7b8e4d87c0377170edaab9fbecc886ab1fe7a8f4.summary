a young man who as a teenager was bullied by strangers in the street for being overweight has lost nine stone to become a catwalk model , and now wants to encourage other men with weight problems to do the same			2
aspiring radio and tv presenter @entity9 , 20 , from @entity10 , weighed 21.5 stone in 2012 , and youngsters would hurl abuse - such as ' @entity13 , @entity14 , run ! ' and ' it 's @entity15 ! ' - at him in the street			1
but @entity9 decided did n't want to be known as ' the fat one ' forever , so dramatically turned his life around , losing almost half his body - weight in just 18 months			1
@entity20 before he lost nine stone , when children would shout insults at him in the street @entity9 now , left , after losing nine stone by running at night and joining a gym , and before losing the weight , right he now weighs under 12.5 stone and feel ' the fittest [ he has ] ever felt ' , and , having never paid much attention to fashion as a teenager , has even appeared in fashion shows in @entity31			1
speaking to @entity32 , @entity9 , who left school at the age of 16 to work in his family 's delicatessen , said : ' from an early age i was never a big fan of sport , and would usually walk around the field while others would run , but i did not start putting on weight until about the age of 14 or 15			1
' he continued : ' i left school at the age of 16 and helped in my family 's delicatessen where i was constantly surrounded by food			1
it was too big a temptation , and by the age of 18 i was 21.5 stone			1
i decided to do something about it			0
' @entity9 now weighs under 12.5 stone and feel ' the fittest [ he has ] ever felt ' , and , having never paid much attention to fashion as a teenager , has even appeared in fashion shows in @entity31 three things inspired @entity9 to change			1
' one was on the television , ' he said , ' when someone was being interviewed and said he knew he 'd never be a " thin person " and would always be " the fat one " , which depressed me			0
i thought , i do n't want to be " the fat one " and forever be fat			2
' the other thing that got me to change was at a music concert , when i stood up to dance and the people behind complained of a " fatty blocking their view "			0
' and the third was that whenever i went out for drinks with my mother , people would think we were a couple and that i was in my late 40s , even though i was in my teens			0
' too frightened to go to the gym for fear of being teased , @entity9 instead went for runs at night after dark			2
when he did run during the day he was harassed in the street by secondary school children yelling slurs such as ' @entity87 ! ' , ' @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity83 ' , and ' it 's @entity15 ! '			0
@entity9 now , holding a picture of himself before he decided to lose the weight so @entity9 persevered running at night , and once he had lost three stone rewarded himself with a gym membership , where he found members to be kind , welcoming and helpful rather than hostile			1
' it was one of the best decisions i have ever made , ' he said			0
' i had built up this stereotype of gyms being for the best only and not social places , but i was wrong			0
i felt so welcomed and accepted and the more i trained , the better i felt			0
' now , i am under 12.5 stone and feel the fittest i have ever felt			2
and i , a person who never thought about fashion , have even appeared as a model in catwalk shows ! ' i just hope that i can get some people who have given up to read this and give them some hope			2
i had given up at one point , but it is never too late			0
' i hope that younger people read this and decide to can change , because it does change your life ! ' just two years ago @entity9 hated having his photograph taken , and now he is happier than ever in front of the camera , and even modelling in fashion shows to those who do n't think sport is ' their thing ' , @entity9 said : ' i was the same , but i have since discovered sport again and love it			1
' i think sometimes at school the sport you learn is daunting and boring , but all schools should encourage students to do any sort of sport they want , so long as it gets them active and fit			0
' @entity9 is now training to be a radio and tv presenter , and would like to explore a career in modelling as well			1
' how amazing that just two years ago , i would have been embarrassed to even have my photo taken ! '			0
