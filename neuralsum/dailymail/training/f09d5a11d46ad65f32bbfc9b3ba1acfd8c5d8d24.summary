the procedure , which he invented , leaves some breast tissue intact for cosmetic reasons , but is not approved in @entity21 because residual tissue could lead to an increased risk of the disease returning			0

@entity1 worked at three nhs and two private hospitals across the @entity48 from 1994 until he was suspended last october			1
police are also investigating the surgeon to see whether he should be charged with assault over the allegations he performed unnecessary surgery on 450 patients who did not have cancer			1
in the aftermath of the announcement of those inquiries , some patients spoke of how their lives had been ‘ ruined ’ by the surgeon , while others spoke out in his support			0

lord @entity105 , chairman of the heart of @entity108 trust , said the review would ‘ determine whether there are lessons to be learned about how the organisation responded to the situation as it evolved , and how it might improve its response to concerns if they are raised in the future			0
’ some of the women treated by @entity1 said they felt mentally tortured by being led to believe they were seriously ill when , in fact , they were perfectly healthy			1
@entity75 , 54 , from @entity96 , had needless lumpectomies in 2002 and 2009 and told the @entity123 she suffered ‘ an assault on the body and mind ’			0
the @entity68 was first alerted to concerns about @entity1 in 2007			2
he was ordered to stop the @entity17 technique			0
@entity69 was informed and also asked the surgeon to stop the procedures			0
