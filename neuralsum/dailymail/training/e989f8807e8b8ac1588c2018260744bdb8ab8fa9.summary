proceedings : a prosecutor and defense lawyer will make their initial pitches to jurors friday in the trial of @entity34 , ( centre ) the former @entity5 student accused of using a webcam to spy on his roommate 's intimate encounter with another man high profile : the case spurred a national conversation about how young gays are treated when news of it broke in september 2010 after @entity34 's roommate , @entity24 , committed suicide the case was so well known that it took four days to seat a jury of 16 â€” including four alternates			1
the first witness called by prosecutors was @entity100 , a high school friend of @entity34 's who testified that @entity34 told him about seeing @entity56 ' making out with some dude ' via webcam			1
on cross-examination , @entity100 , a student at @entity103 , said he did n't know @entity34 to have a problem with gay people			2
three other witnesses , all @entity5 students , followed @entity100 on the stand			2
plea : @entity24 was charged with @entity19 with invading the privacy of @entity24 but made a plea deal that forces her to testify against @entity34 @entity112 asked each if they knew @entity34 to speak against gays			1
@entity115 said he did n't			0
but one , @entity116 , said @entity34 told her that he streamed the video to see whether @entity56 was gay - as he suspected			1
' he said he did n't have any problem with homosexuals and in fact he had a really good friend who was homosexual , ' @entity116 said			0
she said she and a group of a half - dozen students were shown a one - second snippet of streaming video			2
she wanted to see it , she said , out of curiosity			0

another student who lived in the dorm said @entity34 told him he 'd seen @entity56 with another man on his webcam			1
' it was pretty crazy and scandalous , ' @entity143 said			0
' he described the guy he invited over as older			0
and that was more the scandalous part than that he had invited another male			0
' to convict @entity34 of bias intimidation , prosecutors would need to show he acted because he was anti-gay			2
just before opening statements , one more juror was excused after telling the judge that he needed to change an answer he 'd given in a questionnaire			0
the judge did n't offer any further explanation			0
the trial is going forward because @entity34 , 19 , rejected a plea bargain offer that would have let him avoid any jail time and receive the state 's help if federal authorities tried to deport him to @entity164 , where he was born			1
roommates : @entity34 and @entity56 were roommates at @entity5 in @entity32 lawyer @entity112 said the reason for not accepting the deal was simple : he 's not guilty of any crimes			1
if the other man in the video is brought to the witness stand , his testimony could become a key part of the trial			2
he 's been identified publicly only by the initials m.b. the trial is expected to last three to four weeks			0

@entity56 's parents said he told them he was gay in the days before he left for @entity5			1
but court filings show that @entity34 already knew that from @entity56 's web postings			1
authorities say @entity34 used the webcam on his computer to check on @entity56 when he 'd asked to have the room to himself so he could have company			1
@entity34 posted a @entity187 message about it : ' roommate asked for the room till midnight			1
i went into molly 's room and turned on my webcam			0
i saw him making out with a dude			0
' initially , another first - year @entity5 student , @entity24 , of @entity214 , was also charged in the case			1
but she entered a pre-trial intervention program last year that allows her to avoid jail time and emerge without a criminal record if she meets a list of conditions for three years			0
she also agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in their case against @entity34			2
two nights after the first alleged spying incident , authorities say @entity34 tried to do the same thing when @entity56 asked him to stay away from the room again			1
a day after that , @entity56 jumped from the @entity230 , leaving behind a terse @entity232 status updated : ' jumping off the gw bridge , sorry			2
' the trial is expected to delve into text messages , tweets and online chats from @entity56 and @entity34 .			1
