his road closed last week after @entity15 council invested £ 660,000 to finish repairs on the a431 five weeks early , meaning mr @entity5 and wife @entity18 , 52 , will not make a profit			1

friend and neighbouring farmer , @entity67 , was already allowing cars to use a track through his field , and mr @entity5 agreed to rent the land from him until @entity72 and build a road over it , hiring three workmen to help build the road in just ten days			1
the toll road needed to take over 150,000 paying customers to move into profit , which the couple thought was easily possible by @entity72 as more than 25,000 cars passed through its toll booths in the first month motorists were charged £ 2 per journey to use the 365 metres long and seven metres wide bypass made from rolled chippings			1
mr @entity5 and ms race also put up a toll booth and paid attendants to collect the money , as well as shelling out for public liability insurance and @entity94 , at a cost of around £ 150,000 the toll road needed to take over 150,000 paying customers to move into profit , which the couple thought was easily possible by @entity72 as more than 25,000 cars passed through its toll booths in the first month			1

in an open letter to the council , ms @entity18 said : ' the @entity137 is and always was a community initiative to help with the dreadful situation we found ourselves in when the @entity32 closed way back in early february			1
' we thought , stupidly with hindsight , that the council would be supportive			0
after all , we did n't want them to cough up any dosh for it – we wanted it to pay for itself			0
' but we did hope and pray that they would see the practical benefit of the temporary road for ourselves and the thousands of people living this side of a closed road , and the other thousands of people that used that road to get to and from work every day			2

they have even found another £ 660,000 to throw at the @entity32 to " speed up works "			2
' @entity31 has denied trying to block the couple , saying last week that the extra cash was necessary to speed up the works			0

' councillors made an emergency decision to approve an extra £ 660,000 ( for the @entity202 repairs ) following further investigation works at the site , which discovered that below the land which had already moved , there was another layer of ' soft ' rock , which was also at risk of sliding			0
