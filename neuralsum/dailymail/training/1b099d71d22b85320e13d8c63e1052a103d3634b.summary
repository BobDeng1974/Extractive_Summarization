@entity0 believes the way @entity2 perform in the next two matches against sides fighting for their @entity6 status could be crucial in determining how high @entity2 finish this season			1
@entity2 go to @entity8 on saturday bidding to bounce back from the 2 - 0 home loss to @entity10 which dented their @entity12 dream			1
the @entity8 and next tuesday 's opponents @entity14 are five points clear of the relegation zone entering this weekend 's fixtures			1
@entity2 boss @entity0 wants his team to be more effective in their upcoming fixtures @entity2 's players fail to block @entity22 's shot as the @entity10 forward scores at @entity24 's and while their ambitions are at different ends of the standings , @entity0 knows his fifth - placed side must show their ability and be more efficient against @entity8 and @entity14			1
' we will play a lot for our chances for a high position in the table in the next two games			1
we have to realise that , ' he said			2
' we have to be prepared for that			2
i think we 're doing well , if you go back to the game against @entity10 , we played well			2
' we deserved much more than we got			2
now it 's about being more effective			2
' that 's maybe the question at the moment			2
we 're not effective enough to score and to win games			0
( but ) total feel of the team i am happy			0
' @entity49 has provided added steel to @entity8 since being installed as manager , and @entity0 is wary			1
the @entity52 said : ' i have watched two games of theirs the last few weeks			1
@entity55 could start against @entity8 after being punished for poor timekeeping against @entity10 @entity2 face @entity49 ' @entity8 at the @entity58 as they look to get their season back on track ' it 's normal that , as a manager , coming into a new team , you try to sort out the defensive organisation			1
' it 's not easy to score against them			0
all the results are very close , not a lot of goals in their games			0
' always the opponent has more ball possession , but it 's not always about having ball possession			0
it 's about what you make of that			0
' they 're very strong in set - pieces , because they have as a team , the highest score of scoring at set - pieces			0
' they fight for every point and they play out of the qualities that they have			1
that 's the best you can do as a manager			0
' @entity0 knows league position means little when it comes to the match - ups			1
defender @entity98 could start at the @entity58 after recovering from a hamstring injury ' a lot of clubs play not to be relegated or to go in the @entity102 or for the @entity12 positions , ' he said			1
my experience after one season in the @entity6 is that every game is difficult			0
' you can win or lose against anybody			0
you have to go game by game , in my opinion			0
' @entity55 could start after being punished for his poor timekeeping			1
the @entity116 winger was late ahead of the @entity10 clash and was a substitute			0
@entity98 ( hamstring ) is nearing a return and could come back into contention for the @entity14 game , but @entity124 ( knee ) and @entity126 ( groin ) remain out .			0
