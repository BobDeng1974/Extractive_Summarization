by @entity0 @entity1 have slapped a £ 50million price tag on in - demand defender @entity3			1
the @entity4 international has attracted interest from the likes of @entity8 and @entity10 - while @entity9 had a £ 16.5million offer rejected on friday			1
the @entity13 champions are also interested in @entity16 's @entity15 defender @entity14 , although he is believed to prefer a move to @entity10			1
@entity3 has been fined by @entity1 for publicly criticising their latest contract offer , accusing the club of treating him ' like a child ' after being offered what he considered an ' unacceptable ' pay rise			1
priced out of the market ? @entity1 have put a £ 50m price tag on @entity9 target @entity3 however , club director @entity28 insists the 27 - year - old will not be allowed to leave for less than 61million euros ( £ 50million )			1
speaking on @entity1 's official website , @entity28 said : ' @entity31 is a great player with a contract that expires in four years ' time			1
we have no problem with him			0
case for the defence : city have shown interest in @entity3 ( @entity41 ) and @entity14 ( r ) ' perhaps he slipped up with a few comments or words but he did n't intend to distance himself from @entity1 or the fans			2
that 's not exactly how it went			0
it 's true that when he signed for @entity1 he turned down other offers that were higher than ours			2
' i said to him : ' you try and play like @entity3 and we 'll give you an improved contract			2
' we offered him an increase -- although there was no obligation for us to do so -- and we did n't agree on the amount , but he did n't mean to describe it as ' ridiculous			0
' he 's speaking a language that 's not his own -- you ca n't slaughter him for it			0
' blues in the red : @entity9 won the @entity13 but will have their spending restricted by @entity67 regulations @entity28 stressed that @entity3 would stay at @entity1 and accused the player 's agent , @entity68 , of creating problems			1
' i 'd like to remind this man that 30 million is the price i believe @entity3 's weak foot to be worth , his left			2
his right foot is worth at least a million more			0
so you do the maths			0
' ' as i 've said , the player is not for sale , but if his agent wants to speculate on a price for him , then any clubs who are interested should consider him to be worth 61 million			0
' if someone were to offer that amount , then i do n't think i could guarantee that he would stay 100 percent			0
