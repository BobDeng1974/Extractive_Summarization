@entity0 is pleased his @entity2 side are beginning to be appreciated for more than just hard work			1
the @entity2 failed to win any of their first 10 games following promotion but in their subsequent 10 games they have won three times and drawn four more			1
their last two matches have both ended in notable draws , with @entity2 fighting back from 2 - 0 down at @entity10 last sunday and then coming from behind three times on thursday in a 3 - 3 draw at @entity13			1
@entity2 manager @entity0 celebrates on the touchline after @entity15 secured a 3 - 3 draw at @entity17 ' @entity15 fires home @entity2 's third goal four minutes from time to earn a point at @entity13 prior to the last week they had only scored more than once in two games this season , and their growing threat in front of goal is just one of the areas in which @entity0 's team have caught the eye			1
he said : ' we spoke about it last year ; it was a belief we put in place as a group and then people started running with it , this idea of being relentless in how we play			2
' i think it 's picked up			2
incredibly , if you remember , after 10 games people were saying we were negative in our approach , which i then found incredible , and i still do			0
' @entity46 , i thought , spoke fantastically about us the other day when he said afterwards how brave we are in our play and how forward - thinking we are			1
' he said that in private and he said it in the press			0
@entity15 's 86th - minute strike secured a 3 - 3 draw at @entity13 after @entity2 had fallen behind three times @entity2 are just one point adrift in the bottom three after a hard - earned point at @entity13 ' there are good signs of what we are trying to achieve this season , and we are trying to achieve it with a group who have more than just honesty			1
' i am happy with the honesty and i am happy with the resilience and the energy and the physicality			0
but i think we have got some real quality and i think we showed that			0
' @entity0 's team remain in the @entity72 relegation zone but are only one point adrift of safety			1
they take a break from the fight for survival this weekend , with @entity79 the visitors on monday in the third round of the @entity82			0
@entity0 has named the same team for six consecutive matches but will make changes , with defence a concern for the @entity2 boss			1
he had to make three substitutions in the first half at @entity91 , with captain @entity92 picking up a calf injury before his replacement , @entity95 , suffered what appeared to be a serious knee injury , while midfielder @entity98 was unwell			0
with @entity100 having missed the last month with a calf problem , that leaves on - loan @entity103 as potentially the only fit centre - half , and @entity0 must check with @entity105 that he will be allowed to play			1
@entity10 manager @entity46 heaped praise on @entity0 's @entity2 side after they fought back from 2 - 0 down to grab a point last wednesday @entity0 's selection has stood out in contrast to a number of managers complaining about the congested schedule , but he played down the significance			1
he said : ' i choose a team that i think can operate to win a game , i have never really over-thought it more than that			0
it 's up to other people			0
' i believe in the whole squad and i always pick the team that i think can win a game , and it 's not results - bound because you have seen , we have lost a game and then i have picked the same team			2
' i must make it clear , though : every manager , every coach , every club has the right to do it how they see fit			0
if i need to make a change , then i make a change			0
' ( against @entity13 ) it was forced upon us , and i am pleased with the players			2
' they know how much respect i have for them , those who are on the cusp of it , the subs and then the ones beyond that and they know how much pride i have got in the way they conduct themselves around the group			0
' i thought that paid them back in spades because , once they got their chance , they were excellent			2
