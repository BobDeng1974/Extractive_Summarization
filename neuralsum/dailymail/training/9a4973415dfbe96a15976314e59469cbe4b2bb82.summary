one in five cancers is not diagnosed until patients turn up at @entity2 – dramatically slashing their chances of survival			1
much of the reason for the shocking figure is that many people do not know the signs to look out for , so have no idea anything is wrong until the situation is so bad they need emergency help			0
but gps have also been criticised for not spotting the signs early enough			2
one in five cancers is not diagnosed until patients turn up at @entity2 – dramatically slashing their chances of survival ( file picture ) patients who do not find out they have cancer until they see a doctor in a casualty department are twice as likely to die within a year than those referred by their gp – because their disease tends to be more advanced			1
there is a dangerous postcode lottery – with 30 per cent of cancers diagnosed in @entity2 in the worst areas			2
in the best areas , just 13 per cent of cancers are diagnosed in this way			0
the @entity32 report said : ‘ about one in five people are still diagnosed either in an @entity2 department or following an emergency admission to hospital , rather than via a routine screening or gp referral to hospital			1
‘ those diagnosed via emergency presentation are , on average , around twice as likely to die within a year of diagnosis as those diagnosed via an urgent gp referral , because their cancers are generally more advanced			2
those diagnosed at @entity2 with cancer are twice as likely to die within a year than those referred by their gp ‘ more research is needed to understand better how many emergency presentations are avoidable and how they can be avoided			1
’ figures quoted in the report show that the percentage of cancers diagnosed through emergency presentations decreased from 23.7 per cent in the first half of 2009 to 20.6 per cent in the second half of 2012			0
‘ in 2012 , the percentage of cancers diagnosed through emergency presentation varied from 13 per cent to 30 per cent across the 211 clinical commissioning groups , ’ it said			0
‘ between 2009 and 2012 the gap between the clinical commissioning groups with the highest ( top 10 per cent ) and lowest ( bottom 10 per cent ) percentage of cancers diagnosed through emergency presentations decreased by 1.6 percentage points			0
