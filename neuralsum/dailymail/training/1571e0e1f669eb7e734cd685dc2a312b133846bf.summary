more than a quarter of a million car insurance claims are made each year in the @entity2 alone for damages caused by hail stones			2
and now an inventor has devised a ' bouncy castle - inspired ' system to protect vehicles from these storms			2
called @entity10 , the cover inflates within five minutes to surround a car or truck and stops stones damaging the chassis beneath			1
it works with an early warning app that gives drivers up to 30 minutes notice about the chances of a hail storm at four different locations			1
these locations can include the driver 's home or office , for example the protector was designed by @entity20 - based @entity19			1
it works with an early warning app that gives drivers up to 30 minutes notice about the chances of a hail storm at four different locations			1
these locations can include the driver 's home or office , for example			0
but the process is n't quick			0
the driver must get to their vehicle , unpack the cover and place it over their car , plug in the remote control and hit a button to start inflating it - which alone takes five minutes			1
once inflated , though , its makers claim the cover can protect cars from hail stones as large as 2lbs ( 1kg )			2
the button on the remote is powered through a car battery or plug socket and it activates four blowers typically used as cooling fans in desktop computers			1
once forewarned , the driver must get to their vehicle , unpack the cover and place it over their car ( left ) , plug in the remote control and hit a button to start inflating it - which alone takes five minutes			1
air flow remains constant throughout the storm and once it passes , the cover can be compacted to fit in a boot ( right ) air flow remains constant - much like a bouncy castle - throughout the storm and once it passes , the cover can be compacted to fit in a boot			2
depending on the length of the storm , this could also have an impact on the car 's battery life - especially when stationary			2

mr @entity19 , 48 , said : ' physically , the @entity124 uses similar principles to bouncy castles			2
' in 2009 it came to me that there is no solution for protecting vehicles from the damaging effect of hail			0
' i was working in renewable energy at the time , but throughout my career i would look at an issue or problem and ask ' why do n't they come up with something that will fix this ? '' the system has been publicly tested against air cannons , cantaloupes , coconuts , watermelons and baseball pitching machines			0
additionally , the system has been tested in winds in excess of 60mph ( 97km/h ) and comes with an instructional video of how to use it			0
the @entity10 is available in six sizes - three for sedans , hatchbacks and wagons and three for @entity157 , vans and trucks			1
these range from vehicles 10ft ( 3.3 metres ) up to 22ft ( 6.7 metres ) long			0
prices start at $ 349 ( £ 226 ) and the inventors are in talks to set up distribution centres in @entity166			1
mr @entity19 added : ' we are in the final development of a new option for @entity170			0
' the option will enable activation and deactivation of the system via a text message from anywhere in the world			0
' we are also developing a mobile app for the system which will provide alerting in a more informational way and will eventually enable the user to press a button within the mobile app to activate and deactivate their system			0
' the mobile app is between three and 12 months away from launch			0

of course , if you have a garage like the one shown behind the covered car that will equally protect it from hail stones the system has been publicly tested against air cannons ( pictured ) , cantaloupes , coconuts , watermelons and baseball pitching machines			0

the @entity10 cover inflates in five minutes to surround a car or truck
@entity216 continues to flow through the cover to stop stones damaging a chassis
the protector was designed by @entity20 - based @entity19
it works with an app that gives drivers 30 minutes notice about storms
once a driver is forewarned they must unpack the cover and place it over their car , plug in the remote control and hit a button
cover ranges in size from sedans to trucks and prices start at $ 349 ( £ 226 )
