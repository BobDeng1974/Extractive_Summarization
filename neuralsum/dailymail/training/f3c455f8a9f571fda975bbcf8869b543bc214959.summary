he is pictured with owner @entity9 wounded : this x-ray image shows the cat 's wound			1
after being shot , the pet 's thigh bone exploded into 20 separate pieces the pet underwent a 90 minute operation where vets pieced his leg and thigh back together using pins and even glue to seal the bone			1

today , furious miss @entity9 , a petrol station cashier , slammed the yob who targeted her beloved pet			1
she fumed : ' it 's disgusting			0
i 'm so shocked that anyone could do that to a defenceless animal			0
' i ca n't really describe it in words			0
i just hope they catch whoever has done this			0
' angry miss @entity9 , who has had @entity11 since he was seven - weeks - old , had to take out a Â£ 1,000 loan to pay for his operation			2
brave : @entity11 underwent a 90 minute operation where vets pieced his leg and thigh back together using pins and even glue to seal the bone			1
@entity74 is pictured with the cat recovery : incredibly , just 24 hours after surgery , @entity11 was back home with @entity9 at her home in @entity46 , @entity47 she added : ' other pet owners might not be able to take out a loan like i did , so they would just have to part with their best friend			1
' @entity74 , who operated on @entity11 at @entity84 in @entity85 , said the pellet went through the cat 's right buttock			0
he said : ' it 's a particularly horrific injury that he 's suffered			0
' the pellet has gone in through the right buttock , grazed his sciatic nerve and caused the top of the thigh bone to explode into about 20 pieces			1
' we often see cats with pellets in and occasionally they lose an eye or suffer a broken bone , but this must have been done at close range as the energy caused by the impact caused the bone to be blown to smithereens			2
tough : the cat is pictured taking some medicine at home ' we used an interlocking nail to repair the joints			2
it involved inserting a pin down into the bone and a bracket into the outer part of the leg			2
' we managed to piece the other bits of bone back together again like a jigsaw			2
' similar operations usually take about 40 minutes but this one took an hour - and - a - half , it was quite an intricate process			0
' the @entity124 is now appealing for anyone who has any information about the shooting to come forward			0
a spokeswoman said : ' it is absolutely vital that if anyone saw anything suspicious or knows of anyone shooting at animals in the area that they come forward with information			0
' people can not be allowed to get away with causing such awful injuries			0
' a spokesperson for @entity139 added : ' the misuse of an air or pellet weapon in a bid to cause harm can lead to arrest and prosecution			0
