it can already tell you if your flight has been delayed , where you left your car and even wake you up before your station if you fall asleep on the train			0
but @entity8 's latest offering could change the way we book holidays forever			0
it is now able to alert users searching for flights when prices change - with information based on their previous searches			1
file picture the service that already voluntarily offers people information about the their journey and upcoming appointments will make a note of any flight searches you make and let you know when the price of that journey changes			1
how it looks : @entity8 will send price alerts to your smartphone for example , if you search for a flight from @entity42 to @entity43 in october , @entity20 will monitor the prices and alert you via @entity8 if the price drops			1
while other services such as @entity49 have flight alerts , @entity20 's offering is instant , making it more convenient and less time consuming			1
but here 's the catch			0
so far , the service - snappily titled the ' flight price monitor card ' only works when holidaymakers search using @entity56 to search in the first instance			1
so customers searching using other travel search engines such a @entity58 , @entity59 or @entity60 can not make use of the alerts			2
to start using the feature , you 'd need to browse @entity56 to trigger it			2
@entity8 previously displayed flight information based on confirmation emails , but as of now it will automatically monitor prices for flight searches done on @entity56			1
in may , @entity20 announced that smartphones using its @entity8 service will be offering something known as a ‘ parking detector ’			2
the intelligent personal assistant , available within the @entity78 mobile application for the @entity80 and @entity81 operating systems , lists the address of the place where you last left your car			0
it 's worth noting that while @entity20 seems to have your trip - flight booking to catching the correct train - covered , you will have to physically take the holiday yourself			0
@entity8 will make a note of any flight searches you make and let you know when the price changes			0

@entity20 super app makes a note of information from your online searches
sends users alerts when prices for previously searched flights change
@entity105 currently only works if holidaymakers search with @entity56
