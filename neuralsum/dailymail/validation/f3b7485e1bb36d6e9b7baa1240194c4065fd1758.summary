she 's known as the @entity1 of @entity3 politics with a shoe obsession that has seen her attend functions wearing everything from sparkling gold wellies to leopard print kitten heels			0
yesterday , however , the home secretary , 58 , put her best foot forward in a brave choice for a very formal occasion - a pair of black patent leather , leopard - print over-the - knee boots			1
joining the @entity18 , the prime minister and other dignitaries at the @entity21 in central @entity22 to welcome @entity24 's president @entity23 and his wife @entity25 , mrs may strode forth in the flamboyant footwear , even managing to perform a neat curtsy in said boots to greet @entity18			1
mrs may teamed the adventurous boots with a colourful red and gold coat and a warm pair of long red gloves there was no optical illusion to the bright overcoat that the mp for @entity49 was wearing either			1
the colourful red and gold number , which mrs may has showcased before , more than matched the thigh - high boots for glamour			2
a 41 - gun salute , fired by the @entity55 sounded as president @entity23 and his wife arrived with the @entity57 and the @entity58			1
on a particularly inclement day , perhaps the boots were as much about warmth as they were about fashion			0
it 's also not the first time they 've been seen ; mrs may donned the same pair - or something very similar - for another ceremonial greeting back in 2013 when the president of @entity70 , @entity68 arrived for an official visit			2
have n't we seen them somewhere before ? mrs may donned the boots - or something very similar - for another ceremonial greeting back in 2013 when the president of @entity70 , @entity68 visited the @entity3 the mp is famously unapologetic about her fancy footwear , having described her sometimes maverick choices as a conversation starter			1
she once said : ‘ i have no regrets ( about being famous for my shoes )			0
the good thing is that they are often an icebreaker			0
' the @entity84 mp famously sported a pair of leopard - print kitten heels at the @entity87 ’ annual party conference back in 2002 ... and the eye - catching footwear has kept coming ever since			2
it started with leopard - print : the mps penchant for wearing animal prints is well - known ... mrs may famously wore these kitten heels at the @entity87 ’ annual party conference back in 2002 stepping out : more leopard - print with a splash of scarlet ( left ) last year at the @entity99			2
in 2010 , mrs may left a cabinet meeting at @entity101 sporting a pair of stripy flats ( centre ) and ( right ) she famously wore a sari with matching silk heels to an event celebrating the achievements of @entity110 women in the same year rural practicality meets urban bling ... mrs may sported gold hologram wellies ( left ) at a party conference in @entity115 in 2007 and ( right ) , another , earlier , showing for the stripy flats ... this time in 2006 at the @entity117 conference @entity118 ? even more leopard - print , although this time in a much flatter form ... mrs may went for comfort at the @entity84 's annual @entity122 in 2013 teaming a leather skirt with roses on her feet ( left ) , mrs may 's footwear choices have certainly earned her plenty of headlines and ( right ) a confident pose ... and a sensible heel at the @entity84 in @entity129 in 2014 just last month a supporter at the conservative fundraising @entity132 splashed out a cool £ 17,500 to go on a shoe - shopping mission with mrs may			1
and the home secretary even suggested once that her shoe - style had encouraged a young supporter to venture into politics : ' i was in the @entity139 recently and saw a young lady wearing a nice pair of shoes			1
' i said i liked them and she said my shoes were the reason she became involved in politics			0
' although the @entity18 appeared unruffled by the home secretary 's sartorial choices , fashion industry commentators were quick to question the biker chic look			2
fashion writer @entity152 questioned the appropriateness of the shoes for such a formal occasion : ' wearing a pair of boots like this for a night at your friend 's house is fine but i 'd certainly question the choice when you 're heading to a meeting with the @entity24 president and shaking hands with the @entity18			1
they looked uncomfortable to curtsy in			0
' a passion for red after all ? wearing a rather risque outfit at the @entity171 back in 2010 ' it 's the high - shine patent that is particularly unflattering			0
it can look , dare i say it , a bit cheap			0
they do n't really go with that coat and gloves either , which are actually very chic			0
' although it 's unclear where mrs may might have bought the boots from , shoe retailer @entity180 and @entity182 have a strikingly similar pair of ' glossy black croc print patent leather ' costing a not insubstantial £ 465 a pair			1
the brand describes the boot as easy to wear ' with black skinnies for understated glamour by day or dress up with tailored dresses for a cool twist on evening dressing			0
