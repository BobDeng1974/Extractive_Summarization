the @entity0 is back with a bang this week as three @entity3 sides vie for a place in the last eight of @entity7 ’s premier club competition			0
it ’s extremely difficult to predict who will contest the final in @entity11 on june 6 but football analysts @entity12 have predicted which sides will progress from the last - 16 ties , which begin on tuesday evening			2
for the @entity20 sides , @entity18 ’s @entity17 are favourites to dump @entity21 , @entity16 can get past @entity22 but @entity12 , the latest addition to @entity24 , have @entity26 giants @entity25 down to beat @entity28 ’s @entity27			1
@entity29 has been in superb form for @entity17 since signing from @entity31 last summer here are the percentages to progress to the @entity0 last 16 from @entity12 @entity34 , scoring for @entity27 against @entity33 , will hope to defeat @entity25 in the last 16 @entity16 striker @entity36 , celebrating his brace at the weekend , will look to fire his side past @entity22 @entity38 @entity17 met @entity21 in an enthralling quarter - final contest last season with the @entity41 prevailing on the away - goals rule after a 3 - 3 aggregate draw , despite the @entity45 champions winning 3 - 1 at home in the first leg			1
having eased through their group and sitting top of the @entity3 , @entity12 give @entity17 a 64 per cent chance of beating the @entity51 to a last - eight spot			2
that ’s understandable as @entity21 are third in @entity54 and wasted the opportunity to leapfrog @entity56 and @entity57 to go top , throwing away a two - goal lead at home to @entity60 on saturday			2
@entity21 talisman @entity61 has scored twice in the @entity0 this term @entity63 scored @entity65 's crucial goal against @entity66 at @entity67 in the @entity0 group phase @entity71 's @entity70 striker @entity69 celebrates his goal against @entity73 last month @entity27 and @entity25 met at this point last season , with the @entity76 giants prevailing 4 - 1 on aggregate			1
@entity28 ’s side have been a disappointment in @entity7 despite winning the 2012 and 2014 @entity3 titles , hence @entity25 being awarded 66.6 per cent in favour of defeating @entity27 again			1
as usual @entity16 have reached the last 16 of the @entity0 and @entity12 sees them easing past @entity22 with a 67.3 per cent chance as the @entity45 side are well off the pace in @entity54 in fifth place			1
reigning champions @entity86 are given a promising 81.3 per cent chance of seeing off @entity90 ’s @entity89 side but it should n’t be forgotten that the @entity91 led @entity17 to the @entity0 crown in 2012			2
@entity38 @entity93 landed the decisive blow as @entity25 dumped @entity27 out of the @entity0 last season @entity96 ( left ) and @entity93 are once again aiming to land @entity7 's top club prize @entity16 's £ 30m signing @entity99 has been exceptional since arriving from @entity25 in the summer @entity22 forward and former @entity102 star @entity101 in action for the @entity45 side the 2013 @entity0 winners @entity105 are the overwhelming favourites at 92.7 per cent to bypass @entity107 , especially after their astonishing 8 - 0 rout of @entity109 on saturday preserved their eight - point advantage at the top of the @entity112			1
@entity113 , 2013 runners - up , are given just a 32.5 per cent chance against @entity116 , who look a decent bet to land a fourth successive @entity120 title			0
having spent much of the @entity112 season rooted in the relegation zone , it ’s hardly surprising @entity113 are not rated			0
@entity86 defender @entity123 kisses the @entity0 trophy after winning the 2014 edition @entity26 champions @entity31 , who lost in the final last may , are set to breeze past @entity127 , according to @entity12			0
it 's 62.7 per cent for a @entity130 success			0
@entity132 ’s side take on the @entity133 languishing sixth in @entity112 although they did reach the final back in 2002			0
in perhaps one of the less glamorous ties , @entity65 take on @entity71 which @entity12 sees falling in favour of the 2004 champions from @entity139 at a 78 per cent			0
@entity65 finished well behind @entity86 in @entity140 but they did manage to throw @entity66 into the @entity141 in the final fixture			0
@entity143 , the @entity105 boss , gives his pre-match press conference in @entity145 on monday night @entity107 's @entity146 , who has been linked with @entity17 , trains ahead of the match with @entity105 @entity116 coach @entity148 dishes out instructions to defender @entity150 @entity113 boss @entity151 celebrates with @entity152 after friday 's 4 - 2 win against @entity154 @entity155 ( right ) will be crucial for @entity127 against @entity26 champions @entity31 @entity157 and @entity158 celebrate one of @entity31 's goal in their recent win over @entity86 follow @entity24 on @entity162 @ @entity163			1

@entity18 's @entity17 take on @entity21 in the last 16
@entity16 face another @entity45 side @entity22 for a quarter - final spot
@entity27 face a *daunting* task against @entity26 giants @entity25
