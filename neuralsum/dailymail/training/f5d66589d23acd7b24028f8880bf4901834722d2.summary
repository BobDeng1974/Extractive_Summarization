by @entity0 published : 04:31 est , 11 march 2014 updated : 06:42 est , 11 march 2014 @entity2 has removed a video from its website after it emerged that four of the five people it interviewed about police relations in @entity9 were employed by the same marketing company			1
the clip , which was first broadcast on 6 march , appeared to show @entity9 residents being interviewed at random during the @entity14 community event and asked for their views on police relations			1
it was deleted from the @entity2 news website on sunday after questions were raised over how representative the video could be when the majority of those interviewed were employed by youth marketing company @entity23			1
removed : the video was presented by @entity2 reporter @entity24 , a former professional wheelchair basketball player who , it has been claimed , used to edit a youth magazine from the @entity29 office @entity2 conducted the interview after it was revealed @entity31 had spied on the family of @entity33 after the teenager 's murder in 1993			1
the plan was to speak with a number of local residents during the @entity14 community event - which was co-run by @entity40 council and the @entity41 - about how their views on the police may have changed after the findings were made public			1
the report featured five interviews with apparently random members of the local community , all of whom were critical of relations between the public and the police			1
only one of the four interviewees , youth development mentor @entity56 , was credited with having a connection with @entity23 , with the fifth person interviewed being @entity59 - the former chief race advisor to @entity61 mayor @entity60			0
the video was presented by @entity2 reporter @entity24 , a former professional wheelchair basketball player who was previously youth editor of the @entity23 - run publication @entity64			0
taken down : the only person not employed by @entity23 in the clip was @entity59 - the former race advisor to @entity61 mayor @entity60 mr @entity24 later defended his work on @entity68 , arguing that the views he gathered were representative of local opinion			2
during the report , one of the @entity23 employees described how he had often been stopped and searched by police over the previous 15 years , while another said young people felt ' negative ' towards officers			2
two more spoke of a ' disconnect ' and lack of trust between young people and police in @entity9			2
concluding the report , mr @entity24 said : ' i found little hope of change here but a community still fighting for parity			0
' in a statement , @entity2 said : " this was a quick turnaround project , the journalist interviewed people who live , work or were born in @entity9 â € “ who also worked for @entity23			1
they all expressed their own individual view			0
' ' we accept we should have been clear they they all worked at the same place , we should have made further enquiries and we regret this oversight			0
the report was removed from the @entity2 website yesterday			2
' conservative mp @entity104 condemned the broadcaster , saying : â € ˜ this is very disappointing from @entity2			0
a distorted report could have been very unhelpful , indeed inflammatory , and i hope the people concerned have learnt an important lesson.â € ™ @entity23 , which describes itself as a youth - specialist communication agency , has previously worked with @entity2 to promote gang drama @entity113 , and on the stake - a @entity116 - inspired programme designed to encourage entrepreneurship among young people			2
a spokesperson for @entity23 told @entity120 : ' we feel only @entity2 can really comment on their own editorial policy , but from our perspective , it 's pretty simple			0
' ' a reporter , who we know , contacted some people who work at @entity23 for their personal view on a topic , unrelated to the work of the company , but based on the fact they work or live in @entity9			0
' ' the news piece could and should have featured a broader spectrum of @entity9 's community			1
however , we can confirm that @entity23 had no input on the commission , edit or influence of the piece			0

local people were asked their views on public and police relations in @entity9
interviews were conducted at a local community event called @entity14
they were in *response* to news that @entity31 had spied on the family of @entity33 in the years after the teenager 's murder in 1993
clip removed after it emerged majority of interviewees worked at same place
all those interviewed were critical of relations between community and police
@entity2 admits it should have been clearer over who was featured in clip
