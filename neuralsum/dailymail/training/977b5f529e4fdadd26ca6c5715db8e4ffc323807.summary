by @entity0 published : 15:20 est , 28 february 2013 updated : 15:23 est , 28 february 2013 the @entity1 has sparked controversy with some of its @entity4 presenters after it was suggested their programmes could be given a mark out of 10			1

each @entity4 dj ’s programme is to be given its own ‘ whiteboard ’ on which a series of ‘ measurables ’ , such as how many records were played , will be displayed			2
it is unclear which presenters in particular are angered but the station 's talent includes @entity25 left and @entity26 ( right ) but when presenters heard about the idea of also putting up a score out of 10 for their show they reacted with anger			1
insiders branded the suggestion ‘ astonishing ’ and said it was treating its presenters as if they were children			1
one insider added there were also a ‘ lot of angry producers ’ over the plans as well			0

a @entity4 spokesman said : ‘ it is routine good practice to discuss our programmes regularly to ensure we are offering listeners the best service possible			0

insiders branded the suggestion as treating its presenters like children
the station 's talent includes @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity89 and @entity90
