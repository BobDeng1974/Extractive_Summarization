by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 05:45 est , 20 june 2012 updated : 13:44 est , 21 june 2012 it is a campaign that has garnered global interest and provoked anger at her local council			0
now nine - year - old @entity8 's efforts to highlight the poor standard of food in her school have found celebrity support			1
she is teaming up with celebrity chef @entity13 to help the council provide more nutritious meals at her school , @entity16 in @entity17			1
@entity8 's father , @entity18 , wrote in an email to today.com : ' @entity13 has been involved in promoting healthy food for many years			1
' @entity8 enjoyed meeting him as did i and his knowledge and enthusiasm are invigorating			2
' good cause : @entity8 's blog , @entity8 , has raised more than £ 60,000 since she first started it the only offer @entity8 and her father have accepted is working with @entity13 to improve the school 's food @entity8 first hit the headlines after she began her ' @entity8 ' blog , posting pictures of her miserable school dinners online			1
the project has already helped generate more than £ 60,000 in donations to help feed impoverished children around the world			1
@entity8 's father told @entity40 that they have received a number of offers to appear on tv shows around the world and approached by @entity45 about book , television and film deals			1
however , the only arrangement they have accepted is working with @entity13 to improve the school ’s food choices			1
the celebrity intervention comes less than a week after officials at @entity17 council ordered teachers to stop her from photographing her dinners and rating them online			1
in a post headed ‘ goodbye , ’ she wrote : ‘ this morning in maths i got taken out of class by my head teacher and taken to her office			0
‘ i was told that i could not take any more photos of my school dinners			1
’ but the officials seriously underestimated the youngster ’s internet following and thousands of people , led by celebrity chef @entity71 , took to @entity72 to criticise their decision , leading to a humiliating u-turn by the council			2
within hours of @entity71 tweeting to @entity8 to ‘ stay strong ’ and urging his 2.3million followers to re-post his message , the schoolgirl ’s blog became one of the top subjects discussed on the site worldwide			1
critics lined up to accuse the council of ‘ bullying ’ @entity8 by trying to ‘ silence her freedom of expression ’ and thousands signed a petition to get them to overturn the ban			2
and now @entity13 has stepped in to offer his support			0
his restaurant @entity93 won a @entity96 star in 1991 , making him the youngest @entity98 chef to win a star he went on to cook a main course of @entity101 for @entity102 and 250 guests at the @entity104 for her official 80th birthday celebration			0
he will also be known to many as a regular chef on @entity108			0
mega-bite : the schoolgirl posted a photograph of one pathetic offering online as part of a writing project she and her father started back for more : the council had tried to shut the blog down before a @entity72 bakclash forced a u-turn supporters inundated council phonelines with complaints and also pledged thousands of pounds to the @entity125 children ’s charity linked to @entity8 ’s blog , smashing her £ 7,000 target			1
donations , from supporters all over the world , including @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 , now stand at £ 61,519.07			2
a school kitchen will now be built in @entity137 as the result of her fundraising efforts , and she has already come up with a name for it			0
' she decided on ' @entity143 ' to reflect all the generous donations , ' her father added			0
@entity17 - based @entity145 , the charity supported by @entity8 ’s blog , revealed she had raised enough to build several kitchens for starving children in @entity137			1
the charity said : ‘ @entity8 ’s support for @entity145 has been amazing and we are extremely grateful for everything that she has done to help us reach some of the hungriest children in the world			1
’ food for thought : @entity8 posted this picture on an internet blog and began to add daily snaps of her lunches , rating and commenting on them @entity161 grub : @entity8 's photos of her school dinner has turned her into an overnight internet sensation @entity8 's miserable school dinners look set to spark an outcry over nutrition for the nation 's children the decision also angered @entity98 education secretary @entity171 , whose intervention forced the council to perform a u-turn			1
council leader @entity175 announced they would be withdrawing the ban with immediate effect			0
he said : ‘ it ’s a good thing to do , to change your mind , and i ’ve certainly done that			0
’ @entity8 ’s father , @entity18 , 39 , said common sense had prevailed			2
‘ @entity8 is beaming , ’ he said			2
‘ she came home from school with a big smile on her face			0
‘ she is delighted she can carry on blogging , but more so about the money being raised for the charity			0
people have been very , very generous			0
the way the world reacted to the ban is very revealing , it ’s just fantastic that common sense has prevailed			2
’ the saga began seven weeks ago when @entity8 , with permission from teachers at @entity200 , started taking pictures of her £ 2 school dinners and commenting on them as part of a writing project			1
victory ! @entity8 , 9 , and her father @entity207 were all smiles after the council 's decision to make a u-turn on banning her food blog because @entity8 ’s home is on the west coast of @entity98 , however , standards for school meals differ and widespread improvements in the rest of @entity219 appear not to have been applied			1
her first post included a photo of a measly slice of pizza and a lonely potato croquette , alongside a sprinkling of sweetcorn , a cupcake for dessert and a lot of empty space			0
alongside the photo , the schoolgirl wrote : ‘ the pizza in the first pic was alright but i ’d have enjoyed more than one croquette			0
i ’m a growing kid and i need to concentrate all afternoon and i ca n’t do it on one croquette			0
do any of you think you could ? ’ beside a photograph of a limp looking cheeseburger , two potato croquets , a few rings of cucumber and a rocket ice lolly , @entity8 wrote : ‘ today ’s meal was on the menu as @entity248 and ice cream / biscuit but as you can see i got an ice lolly			2
i wish they had stuck to the menu			0
’ over the next two months her daily snaps gathered an impressive following , with more than two million people throughout the world logging on and sending in their own pictures for her site			0
after seeing the photographs , @entity71 , a veteran school food campaigner , sent a tweet to her father , which read : ‘ shocking but inspirational blog			2
big love from @entity267 ’ @entity8 later posted that the celebrity chef had sent her a copy of his @entity71 ’s @entity219 cookbook in which he wrote : ‘ @entity8 , great work ! ! ! clever girl			2
@entity274 keep it up ! ! ’ but last week , @entity8 , whose mother is a gp , revealed that teachers wanted her to stop taking the photographs			1
the council said the decision was made after an article published in a tabloid newspaper , under the headline ‘ time to fire the dinner ladies ’ , left some members of staff at the school in tears			0
in an ill - judged 500 - plus word statement , they accused @entity8 ’s blog of being ‘ misleading ’ and attacked her father for refusing to put an end to it			1
mr @entity18 , who runs a smallholding , correctly predicted the move was an ‘ own goal ’ which would serve only to generate more criticism because ‘ the pictures tell the story about how good the food is ’			0
@entity303 hit : @entity8 's fearless exposé of daily fare at her ( unnamed ) school prompted global discussion about shockingly unhealthy food being served @entity8 's @entity8 blog has chalked up a million hits			1
she is supervised by her father @entity207 ( left )			0

@entity8 started the @entity8 blog six weeks ago
uses it to post images and opinions about what she had been served for lunch at her school ’s *cafeteria* in @entity322 , @entity17
blog has also raised more than £ 60,000 for a charity supporting impoverished children around the world
@entity17 told her to stop taking photos of food in the school *canteen*
but *controversial* ban was lifted following a storm of *protest* on the internet
