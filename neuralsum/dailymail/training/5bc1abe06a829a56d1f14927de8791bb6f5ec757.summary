a cropped version of the controversial image police in @entity3 are interviewing a magazine publisher over a photograph showing a young female pop star in an ' inappropriate pose ' with a boy			1
the photograph , showing @entity11 singer @entity10 , 21 , naked with a blond child cupping her breasts from behind , was to be published in @entity14			1
publisher @entity15 was planning to run the photograph , which came from a forthcoming book of photographs of the singer , in its weekly manga ( or comic - style ) magazine earlier this month			1
but that edition did n't make it to the newsstands , and detectives were called in after concerns were raised that the picture might infringe even @entity26 's notoriously lax child pornography laws			1
@entity10 is a huge star in @entity26 , where she has been a singer since the age of 14 and is best known for being a part of the phenomenal , 91 - strong girl group @entity11			1
the group - the world 's largest - is one of the highest - earning musical acts in the world and recruits new members through @entity38 - style auditions			1
all the girls must be well - behaved , and they perform in a theatre every day , with tickets only available through a heavily - subscribed lottery			0
initially @entity15 said the delay in getting the magazine out was due to it containing an ' inappropriate expression ' but police said they needed to investigate further and called staff in to be interviewed			2
@entity15 pulled the photograph and postponed the sale of the magazine from january 12 to january 21			2
they also took it out of their planned collection of photographs of the singer			0
investigators , who say their first job is to discover if the photograph is real or not , say they will take into consideration the fact that the edition featuring the picture was scrapped before it was published			0
the @entity64 and @entity65 says that any photo that depicts a child touching the breasts or sexual organs of another individual and which could sexually arouse or stimulate a viewer is defined as child pornography , according to @entity73			2
@entity26 phenomenon : @entity10 ( sixth from left , back row ) is pictured with some of her group @entity11 the website quoted @entity77 , a lawyer who has worked on child pornography cases , saying : ' the @entity80 @entity79 ... last july found that if anyone , even a small number of people , became sexually aroused , that would fulfill ( the condition in the child pornography definition )			1
' he added : ' regardless of whether or not a large number of people would become sexually aroused by a photo of a child touching someone else 's sexual organs , there is the possibility of the photo being considered pornography			2
' @entity26 website tokyoreporter.com said that the country 's child pornography laws stipulated a maximum of five years in prison and a fine of five million yen			0
it quoted the investigating team as saying : ' in comparison to @entity26 , penalties in @entity106 for using a young boy in child pornography are more severe			0
' we are taking into account that this could be a problem at an international level			0
' @entity15 issued an apology , saying : ' in future we will endeavour to do our best to respect the freedom of speech of an author , writer , cartoonist or photographer			0
' we are committed to working with more compliance measures in place as we continue to engage in our publishing activities			0
' @entity10 joined @entity11 in 2006 but announced last month that she was planning to ' graduate ' from the group			1
the photograph collection , which will be her first solo book , is entitled ' @entity127 no koto , suki ? ' ( do you like @entity127 ? ) and is expected to be published without the offending image next month .			0
