@entity0 will not be wearing @entity2 ’s cursed no 9 jersey this season			1
the exit of @entity5 had freed up the shirt traditionally worn by centre forwards			1
but @entity0 , who has joined @entity2 in a £ 10.5million deal from @entity9 , has opted for no 18 , confirmed on wednesday night when @entity11 clubs submitted their 25 - man squad lists			1
the no 9 shirt will remain vacant until january at least , and that is perhaps best given its recent history			1
@entity30 fans will look back fondly on years in which the famous number was worn by the likes of @entity34 and @entity35			0
however , the digit did n't bring as much luck to @entity39 striker @entity38 or @entity41 defender @entity40 during their time in west @entity42			2
@entity5 scored just 20 league goals during three - and - a - half years at @entity28			2
his predecessor , @entity44 , failed to score any , and @entity45 and @entity40 did not enjoy happy stays at the club			0
before that there was @entity51 striker @entity50 , and his one season wearing the shirt produced 10 goals			1
@entity38 arrived from @entity55 having scored 78 in two seasons in @entity57 but as the @entity58 9 managed just seven			2
@entity59 has retained the no 1 jersey despite @entity61 starting the season as @entity64 ’s first - choice goalkeeper			0
elsewhere , @entity65 have omitted defender @entity66 from their squad and he could now head out on loan to the championship			0
but there is a place for @entity73 misfit @entity72 in @entity75 ’s squad			0
@entity76 is also included at @entity77 , despite appearing to be on his way out of @entity79 before a deadline - day move to @entity9 collapsed because of his wage demands			0
team player : @entity23 posted a message on @entity84 explaining the new shirt situation new beginnings : @entity5 has sealed a two - season long loan move to @entity88 @entity89 excited by new @entity88 challenge			1
