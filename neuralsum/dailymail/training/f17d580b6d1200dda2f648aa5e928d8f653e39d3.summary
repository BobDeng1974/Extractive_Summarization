by @entity0 this is the moment a bionic squirrel manages to lift a very heavy - looking dumbbell ... or so it appears			1
after a few quick seconds inspecting the weight , the creature gets itself into prime lifting position - and is ready to put his muscles to the test			1
incredibly , he appears to lift the weight into the air - holding it proudly just below his head			2
flexing his muscles : the brave squirrel sizes up a particularly heavy - looking weight ready to go : the creature looks as though he is willing himself to pick the dumbbell up lift me up : the squirrel appears to pick up the weight - and even looks shocked at his own ability however , the scene is really just a clever trick set up by photographer @entity26 in his garden in @entity28 , @entity29			1
mr @entity26 , who has photographed bodybuilders for a number of projects , attached the dumbbell to a wire			2
he then slowly lifted the weight as the squirrel held on , creating the illusion			2
mr @entity26 said : ' i had a few weights lying around so thought it 'd be fun to see whether the squirrels which regularly come into our garden would check it out			0
trick : the amusing photograph is actually an illusion , set up by photographer @entity26 ' did anyone see that ? ' : the trick was achieved using a pulley system - set up in the photographer 's garden ' i used some see - through wire so it looked extra natural and then it was just a matter of time waiting for one to get into the perfect position			1
' it took a while and as they are wild animals you need a lot of patience			0
but fortunately one eventually sat in the exact spot i was hoping for and i managed to get a few snaps			0
' i nicknamed him @entity68			0
' ' maybe i 'll give it another go ' : the photographer said he nicknamed the creature @entity73			0
