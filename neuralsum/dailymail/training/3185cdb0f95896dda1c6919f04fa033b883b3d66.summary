by @entity0 an apparently healthy baby boy died in his sleep during a morning nap after contracting a common virus which usually manifests itself as nothing worse than a minor fever			1
@entity7 , aged just 14 months , went into cardiac arrest when he contracted enterovirus - though his mother was told that all he needed was cough medicine			1
after an inquest into the infant 's death , his parents paid tribute to his ' big smile ' and spoke of their devastation at his sudden death			1
tragedy : @entity7 died in july after contracting the common enterovirus the little boy fell ill in july , worrying his parents as he appeared breathless and threw up at home in @entity24 , @entity25			1
his mother @entity26 called an @entity28 helpline and was told he probably had an infection and should get some rest			1
the next day , a chemist advised her to give @entity7 cough medicine , and she put him to bed after dropping his older brother @entity34 off at school			1
but when she tried to wake him he was unresponsive , so she rushed him to @entity36 where he was put on life support , but he was pronounced dead an hour later			2
an inquest into the youngster 's death in @entity41 found that he had died of natural causes			1
mother : @entity26 thought he just had a cough and put him to bed for a nap after doing the school run tribute : @entity7 's parents said he had a ' big smile ' and loved spending time with his family ms @entity26 , 32 , told the hearing : ' he was just being sick , i rang @entity55 on sunday evening and they said there was nothing they could do and to stick it out			1
' on monday morning we took @entity61 to school and on the way back i nipped to the chemist and said he was being sick and had a cough			1
they could only offer cough medicine			1
' we went home and laid on the settee , i said we 'd go for a lie down , he had a bit of toast and i thought he was getting better			2
' he went to sleep but then he was n't waking up			2
i ran across to my neighbour 's house and they tried to bring him round , then we got the ambulance			0
' you just never imagine that your baby will die			0
you think that after one year old they are safe and past any harm			0
' the inquest heard that @entity7 had contracted an enterovirus from food or something in his environment , and that while most children suffer only a minor illness from the virus it can occasionally prove fatal			1
hearing : @entity90 and ms @entity26 outside @entity91 after the inquest into @entity7 's death finding : the coroner declared a verdict of death by natural causes saying there was nothing to be done paediatric pathologist @entity101 told the inquest : ' it 's an oral route , it could be on food , or could be due to touching something and putting it in his mouth			1
it could have been a number of days that he had it , but probably did n't have any symptoms which related to it			0
' she added : ' in a small number of people this might affect the heart muscle and get a marked inflammation in the heart muscle			0
@entity120 is an umbrella term for a group of viruses which cause diseases ranging from the common cold to the crippling illness polio			1
the virus is usually transmitted by eating contaminated food or touching surfaces which are carrying the pathogen			1
the most common illness caused by the virus is a cold and fever , which are usually defeated by the body 's immune system within a few days			1
however , some patients suffer a more severe reaction , leading to cardiac arrest which can prove fatal			1
@entity120 is also a well - known cause of meningitis in children , while some strains of the virus lead to polio , another devastating childhood illness			2
it is not possible to determine whether or not children are likely to suffer an adverse reaction from enterovirus , nor is there a reliable treatment for it			2
' for reasons that we do n't understand people get the enterovirus infection and it goes to the heart muscle and it can be fatal			2
of those people who die of this infection the majority would be in this age group of one to two years of age			0
' it could have been because his heart muscle was inflamed and did n't work as well , or you can get an increase of fluid in the lungs			0
there is nothing that can be done against the virus because we do n't have the treatment			2
' when i examined the heart it was slightly large , in particular the muscle of the heart looked quite pale and looked quite patchy			0
' it made me think that there must have been something wrong with the heart muscle , it made me think this could be an infection of the heart muscle			0
when i looked at the heart under the microscope it was severely inflamed			0
' it appears to me he died due to inflammation of the heart muscle which he got because of an oral infection			2
' speaking after the inquest , @entity7 's father @entity90 , 39 , said : ' my boy was as good a son as any could be			1
he was a very happy boy and we are heartbroken that he has gone			0
' he had a big smile and was known for it			0
he has two older sisters and an older brother , @entity34			0
they were very close even though he still was n't able to speak			0
' since his death i have found it more difficult to look forward			0
all we have now are memories			0
the medics were fantastic and tried for a lengthy period of time to save him			0
' police investigated the little boy 's death but could not find any cause for concern , saying that @entity7 had been a ' beautiful boy '			1
tests showed the cause of death as being of myocarditis due to enterovirus			2
coroner @entity219 told the boy 's family : ' in a tiny minority of people particularly in young children it is sadly a fatal condition because there is nothing that can be done			2
' it is a viral infection where you have to hope for the body to recover on its own			0
this is a naturally occurring condition			0
