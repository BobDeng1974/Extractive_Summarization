unapologetic : @entity1 , secretary of state for education , has shrugged off controversies over the inspection of @entity6 faith schools education secretary @entity1 last night shrugged off recent controversies over the inspections of @entity6 schools and launched a stalwart defence of her ‘ @entity13 ’ drive			1
in the wake of the row over some faith schools in the @entity18 being labelled intolerant , she said she was ‘ unapologetic ’			1
parents had complained that young children were being asked ‘ inappropriate ’ questions by @entity23 inspectors about gays , lesbians and @entity26			0
just last week , the @entity27 reported how a ten - year - old girl came home from school crying after giving the ‘ wrong ’ answer to an inspector who asked her : ‘ what is a lesbian ? ’ @entity39 ’s school , @entity36 in @entity37 , has now been put in special measures after the official @entity23 report found that discrimination ‘ persisted ’ there			1
her mother , @entity44 , 46 , said : ‘ the questioning was completely inappropriate			0
’ however , mrs @entity46 said last night that she would ‘ vigorously defend ’ the @entity48 values drive because it helped to ‘ open young people ’s minds ’			1
she added : ‘ i have no sympathy for those who say that @entity48 values do n’t apply to them			1
every school regardless of faith should be promoting @entity48 values			1
’ the education secretary , who has been nicknamed ms u-turn for abandoning policies by her back - to - basics predecessor @entity62 , condemned schools where girls might be made to sit apart from boys , or where ‘ homophobia goes unchecked ’ , saying : ‘ no school should be exempt from promoting fundamental values			1
’ the so - called @entity13 drive was launched last summer amid fears of an @entity72 take - over of some state schools in @entity74			1
but the new inspection regime has led to claims from other faith schools that they are being unfairly targeted			1
mrs @entity46 also attacked ‘ old - fashioned nostalgia ’ when it came to reforming the education system			2
in a speech to the political think tank @entity82 , she revealed her plans for change were not about an ‘ outdated world view ’ , but boosting social mobility			0
mrs @entity46 said : ‘ the rationale that underpins our plan for education is simple – it is n’t about an outdated world view or old - fashioned nostalgia			2
' it ’s about a refusal to accept that educational attainment must be correlated to the wealth of your parents – that your future life chances are determined not by talent or effort , but by the circumstances of your birth			0
‘ none of us who believe in meritocracy , whatever side of the political spectrum , can be content with that			0
’ congratulating her government ’s achievements over the last five years , she said the attainment gap was narrowing and one million more pupils were now studying in good or outstanding schools			2
and she described the rationale behind some of the @entity120 ’s policies , including curriculum , practical skills and ‘ character education ’			0
the latter means putting ‘ character - building ’ lessons on a par with traditional subjects			2
‘ no school should be exempt ’ : @entity36 in @entity37 has now been put in special measures after the official @entity23 report found that discrimination ‘ persisted ’ there mrs @entity46 said : ‘ just as important to the next generation ’s future as getting a sound academic grounding is ensuring they have the resilience and grit to deal with the challenges that life will throw at them			1
‘ to support schools , we ’re investing in character education , supporting projects like the cadets , debating in schools and team - building activities , and providing support to help the best of these projects expand			2
’ this policy is in stark contrast to mr @entity62 ’s insistence that education policy should revolve around a thorough grounding in the essentials of maths , spelling , grammar and punctuation			0
mrs @entity46 , who replaced mr @entity62 last summer , has been previously criticised for giving too much ground to teachers			0
as well as promising the unions she would do everything to reduce teachers ’ workload , she scrapped mr @entity62 ’s introduction of snap @entity23 inspections			0
and she abandoned his plan to punish misbehaving children by sending them on a run .			0
