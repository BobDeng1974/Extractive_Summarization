by @entity0 published : 02:03 est , 2 january 2014 updated : 02:03 est , 2 january 2014 the prison at @entity3 has taken a significant step towards finally shutting down			2
the @entity5 announced tuesday that three hard to transfer @entity8 @entity7 detainees are transferring out to @entity9			1
the government captured 22 in 2001 in @entity11 and soon realized they were not enemies , but had a difficult time finding them new homes			1
they could not be sent to @entity8 because the country has a long history of oppressing the ethnic group and the communist regime pressured one country to back out of a deal to accept them , the @entity16 noted			1
finally free : the final three uighurs remaining at @entity3 have been freed ‘ the @entity26 is announcing today the transfer of @entity28 , @entity28 , and @entity29 from the detention facility at @entity3 to the @entity31 , ’ @entity5 press secretary rear adm. @entity24 said in a statement			0
‘ these three are the last ethnic @entity7 @entity8 nationals to be transferred … and are voluntarily resettling in @entity9 , ’ he continued			1
the transfer of the three men to @entity9 marks a total of 11 detainees leaving the prison since last summer , including nine in december alone , the @entity16 noted			1
' the @entity38 is grateful to the government of @entity9 for this humanitarian gesture and its willingness to support @entity38 efforts to close the @entity3 detention facility , ’ said mr @entity24			1
finally free : @entity8 @entity44 detainees , who at the time were cleared for release but had no country to go to , show a home - made note to visiting members of the media in 2009 the @entity7 were picked up shortly after the @entity38 invasion of @entity11 on suspicion they had received weapons training and were allied with @entity55			1
@entity38 suspicions were proven wrong within a few months , but there was no where they could go			0
there are now 155 detainees left in @entity44 , and roughly half of them are already approved for transfers – most are @entity64 , according to the @entity16			0
‘ all 22 uighurs from @entity3 now have been resettled to six different countries , and these three resettlements are an important step in implementing president @entity71 ’s directive to close the @entity3 detention facility , ’ mr @entity65 told the @entity16			2
efforts to close the facility were renewed after president @entity71 appointed @entity65 earlier this year as the envoy tasked with reducing headcount at the terror prison			0
uighurs were the most difficult prisoners to move , the @entity16 explained , because of the complications surrounding their leaving @entity3			0
‘ from the beginning , we knew that one test of our determination to close @entity3 would be measured by what happened to the @entity7 , ’ former obama white house counsel @entity80 told the @entity16			2
crackdown : armed @entity8 soldiers march on patrol in 2009 as an @entity7 man crosses the street in @entity90 ‘ that the last of the @entity7 has now left @entity3 is an important milestone , ’ he added			1
‘ they did n’t belong there in the first place			0
’ the government agreed , but removing them took time			2
they could not be sent back to @entity8 because of humanitarian concerns stemming from @entity8 crackdowns on unrest in their region			1
plans to settle them in 2009 in @entity106 were met with stiff resistance from @entity108 and eventually dropped			0
agreements reached with @entity110 , the @entity111 and @entity112 were rejected by the prisoners themselves			0
the population is slowly dropping : there are now 155 detainees remaining at the terror prison @entity119 agreed to take the remaining three , which they accepted , but those plans were scuttled when @entity8 pressured the @entity124 country to withdraw the offer			1
they finally agreed on @entity9 , and the deal was announced this week			1
the other @entity7 detainees accepted offers to go to @entity130 , @entity112 , @entity110 and @entity131			2
@entity3 was thrust back into the spotlight after retired major general @entity133 called for its closure in a @entity136 op - ed and a series of media appearances			2
president @entity71 made closing the base one of his primary targets during the 2008 presidential election			0
his efforts to do so languished until recently			0
he said in a statement issued thursday after signing the 2014 @entity143 that he is optimistic about the prospects of the prison closing			0
‘ i am encouraged that this act provides the executive greater flexibility to transfer @entity3 detainees abroad , and look forward to working with the @entity108 to take the additional steps needed to close the facility			0

a total of 22 were *apprehended* in 2001 in @entity11
they were soon determined to not be threats , but the government had difficulty finding them new homes
@entity8 has a history of *brutally* oppressing @entity7 *rebellions* and even pressured @entity119 to back out of a deal to take them
they are heading to @entity9
