for years @entity0 dismissed claims that technology , and particularly artificial intelligence , could threaten humans			1
but in a recent interview , the 64 - year - old admitted he can now see some of the predictions coming true and that human - like computers could be a dangerous reality			1
he even quipped : ' will we be the gods ? will we be the family pets ? or will we be ants that get stepped on ? i do n't know			1
he even quipped ' will we be the gods ? will we be the family pets ? or will we be ants that get stepped on ? i do n't know ' the @entity24 co-founder made the comments during an interview with @entity27 at @entity28			1
he said : ' computers are going to take over from humans , no question			1
if we build these devices to take care of everything for us , eventually they 'll think faster than us and they 'll get rid of the slow humans to run companies more efficiently			1
he directly referenced warnings issued by both @entity39 and @entity40 about the threat @entity42 has on humanity			1
the pair is part of a group of experts , known collectively as the @entity48 , who recently drafted an open letter saying scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind			1
the authors said there is a ' broad consensus ' that @entity42 research is making good progress and would have a growing impact on society			1
but it issued a stark warning that research into the rewards of @entity42 had to be matched with an equal effort to avoid the potential damage it could wreak			1
for instance , in the short term , it claims @entity42 may put millions of people out of work			1

' @entity82 's human - like robot is pictured mr @entity0 directly referenced warnings issued by both @entity39 ( pictured ) and @entity40 about the threat @entity42 has on humanity			1
for example , @entity86 boss mr @entity39 said he believes humans could be banned from driving in years to come and all cars will , instead , be controlled by robots earlier this month @entity86 boss mr @entity39 said he believes humans could be banned from driving in years to come and all cars will , instead , be controlled by robots			1
the entrepreneur claimed that computers will one day do a much better job of driving and that humans are simply ‘ too dangerous ’ behind the wheel			1
in a paper called robots are @entity101 : some @entity102 , lead researcher @entity103 said : ' whether it 's bombing our enemies , steering our planes , fielding our calls , rubbing our backs , vacuuming our floors , driving our taxis , or beating us at @entity111 , it 's hard to think of hitherto human tasks that smart machines ca n't do or wo n't soon do			2
' the ' @entity115 ' has a cub - like face but packs enough strength to transfer patients from a wheelchair ( pictured ) or a floor - level bed to a bath , for example a recent report by management consulting firm @entity124 predicted by 2025 the number of ' automatable ' tasks will rise to 25 per cent			2
this will lead to robots replacing many human jobs - and is a trend that has already begun in @entity131			1
earlier this week @entity133 - @entity132 in @entity134 , @entity131 unveiled its latest @entity115			2
the ' @entity115 ' has a cub - like face but has enough strength to transfer patients from a wheelchair or a floor - level bed to a bath			2
it weighs 309lb ( 140kg ) with extending legs that stop the ' bear ' from falling over and it moves slowly and smoothly thanks to advance actuators in its mechanical arms			0
and at the start of the month , @entity146 said it will begin employing a humanoid called @entity149 in its branches from april , on a trial basis			0
and if the trial is successful , the robotic employees will be rolled out to more branches of the @entity131 bank by 2020			0
elsewhere , in @entity157 there is a hotel manned entirely by robots			2
from reception desk staff to security doormen and waiters , the @entity160 in @entity161 , @entity157 , has built , rather than hired , new employees			0
start - up costs and robot maintenance aside , staff bills are minimal and the hotel can pass these savings back to the customer as a night 's stay costs just £ 6.80 per night			2
with this in mind , mr @entity103 and his colleagues at the @entity173 asked whether ' human replacement ' - the act of building better versions of ourselves - will deliver an economic utopia or leave us earning too little to buy the goods the robots are making ? using a simulated economy , they found that the value of coders and developers will increase as the demand for smart machines rise			1
as processes improve and technology advances , the price to produce these machines will decline , which will deliver a ' tech boom '			2
this in turn will raise the demand for new code			0
but over time , the stock of so - called ' legacy code ' will grow because so many people are working on the projects , causing an abundance			2
plus this code will ultimately cause machines to become smarter and learn how to use the legacy code themselves			0
using a simulated economy , a recent paper found the value of coders will increase as demand for machines rise			1
as tech advances , costs will decline to deliver a ' tech boom '			0
but over time , the stock of so - called ' legacy code ' will grow causing demand for new code and high - tech workers to drop and see them replaced by robots the eventual decline in jobs will limit what young people can save and invest			1
this means less capital will be available for the future generations and means production could actually fall over time , despite the fact machines are capable of producing goods more efficiently			0
a robot hotel employee in @entity157 is shown this will cause demand for new code and , thus for high - tech workers , to drop and see such workers replaced by robot employees			2
' the resulting tech bust reflects past humans obsolescing current humans			2
these robots contain the stuff of humans - accumulated brain and saving power , ' said the paper			1
' in fact , high - tech workers can start out earning far more than low - tech workers , but end up earning far less			2
' artificial intelligence has been described as a threat that could be ' more dangerous than nukes '			2
now a group of scientists and entrepreneurs , including @entity39 and @entity40 , have signed an open letter promising to ensure @entity42 research benefits humanity			1
the letter warns that without safeguards on intelligent machines , mankind could be heading for a dark future			0
@entity262 warning : professor @entity40 says we must be vigilant about artificial intelligence the document , drafted by the @entity48 , said scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind			1
the authors say there is a ' broad consensus ' that @entity42 research is making good progress and would have a growing impact on society			1
it highlights speech recognition , image analysis , driverless cars , translation and robot motion as having benefited from the research			0
' the potential benefits are huge , since everything that civilisation has to offer is a product of human intelligence ; we can not predict what we might achieve when this intelligence is magnified by the tools @entity42 may provide , but the eradication of disease and poverty are not unfathomable , ' the authors write			1
but it issued a stark warning that research into the rewards of @entity42 had to be matched with an equal effort to avoid the potential damage it could wreak			1
for instance , in the short term , it claims @entity42 may put millions of people out of work			1
in the long term , it could have the potential to play out like a fictional dystopias in which intelligence greater than humans could begin acting against their programming			0
the paper uses the example of @entity315 , the reigning @entity316			0
junior can beat every current and , possibly , every future human on the planet			0
consequently , his old code has largely put new chess programmers out of business			0
the eventual decline in high - tech and , potentially , low - tech workers income will limit what young people can save and invest , continued the paper			0
this means less capital will be available for the future generations and production could actually fall over time , despite the fact machines are capable of producing goods more efficiently			0
an alternative outcome of this is that high - skilled workers will move into low - skilled , lower paid positions , which will force these low - skilled workers into unemployment			0
and once people are out of work , welfare costs will rise putting a greater strain on the economy			0
the authors suggest people start saving for this eventuality an alternative outcome of this is that high - skilled workers will move into low - skilled , lower paid positions , which will force these low - skilled workers into unemployment			0
and once people are out of work , welfare costs will rise putting a greater strain on the economy			0
the authors even suggest people start saving for this eventuality			0
' the long run in such cases is no techno - utopia			0
yes , code is abundant			0
and yes , everyone is fully employed			0
but no one is earning very much , ' said mr @entity368			0
' in short , when smart machines replace people , they eventually bite the hands of those that finance them			0

@entity24 co-founder made the comments to @entity28
the 64 - year - old admitted he had previously dismissed claims technology will threaten humans in the next 30 years
but now realises predictions are coming true and @entity42 is a dangerous reality
he quipped : ' will we be the gods ? will we be the family pets ? '
his comments follow warnings from @entity39 and @entity40
mr @entity39 recently said robots could replace humans as drivers
and previous reports have found @entity42 could cause the economy to crash
