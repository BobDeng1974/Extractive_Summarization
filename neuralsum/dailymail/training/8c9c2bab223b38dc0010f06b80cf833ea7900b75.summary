by @entity0 published : 19:00 est , 6 november 2012 updated : 12:27 est , 7 november 2012 @entity3 - toothed tigers feasted on prehistoric horses , researchers believe			2
the diets of ancient apex predators is difficult to discern , because as they were at the top of the food chain there were fewer of them			2
but ' exceptional fossil sites ' in @entity12 , near @entity13 , have yielded clues as to what three ancient carnivores fed upon , reports journal @entity17 this illustration depicts how the region of @entity12 in central @entity21 likely looked 9 million years ago			1
researchers used carbon to shed light on how saber - toothed cats and bear dogs shared space and prey during the late @entity30 period researchers studied two sabre - toothed cats - one the size of a modern leopard and the other the size of a modern tiger - as well as a prehistoric ' bear dog '			1
the team calculated what kind of creatures lived in the area nine million years ago from dental records			1
they then compared the carbon isotope of the three predators to those of the herbivores , allowing them to make a calculation as to what the beasts ate			2
dr @entity52 , of the @entity53 , said that the sabre toothed cats ate ancient horses , while the bear dog ate astroportax , similar to the modern buffalo			1
he said : ' the two sabre toothed cats consumed herbivores from more dense woodland , a habitat that would have allowed the smaller cat to hide from the larger one			0
' on the basis of their different body sizes it is likely that these two cats avoided competition for prey by hunting herbivores of different size			0
@entity76 has been known about how the sabre toothed tiger , shown here in a @entity81 museum , co-existed with other species ' analysis indicated that hipparionine horses were moderately to very feasible prey of these cats			1
' the smaller cat probably incorporated additional prey species from more dense woodland			0
' he said a study of the bear dog found it ' implied prey acquisition from open woodland ' diet preferences indicate it was the only predator commonly consuming astroportax , that occupied more open woodland			1
' to arrive at their findings , the researchers conducted what 's called a stable carbon isotope analysis on the animals ' teeth			1
using a dentist 's drill with a diamond bit , they sampled teeth from 69 specimens , including 27 saber - toothed cats and bear dogs			1
the rest were plant - eaters			0
they isolated the carbon from the tooth enamel			0
using a mass spectrometer , which you could think of as a type of scale , they measured the ratio of the more massive carbon 13 molecules to the less - massive carbon 12			0
an isotope is a version of an element that contains a different number of neutrons in its @entity130 12 and 13 are both present in the carbon dioxide that plants take in during photosynthesis			0
different plants make use of the isotopes in different ways , and so they retain different amounts of them in their fibers			0
when an herbivore eats a plant , that plant leaves an isotopic signature in the animal 's bones and teeth			2
the signature travels through the food chain and can be found in carnivores as well .			0

team analysed ' exceptional fossil site ' near @entity13 for the *unprecedented* look into the tiger 's diet
also studied the ' bear dog ' which hunted on open ground
