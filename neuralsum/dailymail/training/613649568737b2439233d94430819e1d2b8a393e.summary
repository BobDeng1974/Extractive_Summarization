@entity2 , 33 , who shot @entity13 ten times before dumping his body on the side of the road , was executed wednesday night in @entity17 , @entity4			1
@entity2 was the sixth prisoner executed in @entity4 this year , but the first since the @entity18 announced its switch to single - drug lethal injections amid a drug shortage that has left states in the @entity12 scrambling for acceptable alternatives			1
it was announced last week that @entity4 would use a single dose of pentobarbital as a lethal injection , instead of using the sedative in combination with two other drugs as before			1
@entity31 became the first state to use a single drug a year ago , and several other states have since made the switch			2
last rites : the death chamber inside the @entity38 at @entity17 , where @entity2 was executed wednesday evening courts have upheld the practice , despite the reaction of death penalty opponents who claim that prisoners take longer to die with a single drug			1
@entity2 - known to his friends as @entity47 - had made appeals against his sentence based on his mental capacity , the competence of his lawyers , and whether recent lower federal court rulings improperly blocked his current legal team from pursuing appeals			0
in 2004 , a federal court spared @entity2 less than an hour before he could have been taken to the death chamber , so that it could consider arguments that he was mentally impaired and therefore ineligible for the death penalty			1
that appeal was subsequently rejected			0
more recently @entity2 's lawyers told the @entity12 @entity62 that , while tests show @entity2 's iq is considerably higher than levels determining mental impairment , he suffers from a fetal alcohol disorder that should disqualify him from execution			0
@entity69 , the former @entity70 assistant district attorney who prosecuted @entity2 for capital murder , dismissed claims that the 33 - year - old was disabled			1
' he was quite capable of functioning and figuring out how to rob people , ' he said			0
@entity2 was 19 at the time of @entity13 's murder and had a lengthy criminal record that included burglary , robbery , assault , sexual assault and possession of weapons			2
the @entity38 is following the lead of prisons in other @entity12 states by switching to the single - drug lethal injection method @entity13 was abducted at gunpoint as he was cleaning his car at a self - service car wash in @entity70			1
a security camera video at a convenience store next to the car wash captured images of @entity2 with two other @entity70 men and a woman from @entity98			2
they had been out looking for someone to carjack , authorities said			0
according to trial testimony , @entity2 and @entity101 forced @entity13 into the stockbroker 's car , and @entity2 drove it to an area near @entity70 ' wastewater treatment plant			1
the two others , @entity109 and @entity110 , followed in a second car			0
@entity13 , from @entity112 , was shot with a stolen , assault - style rifle and then with a .22 - caliber pistol			0
@entity110 testified that @entity2 shot @entity13 with the rifle and then continued to fire after he hit the ground			2
@entity101 then shot him with the pistol			0
she also testified that @entity2 later waved around a newspaper account of the crime and was pleased it said @entity13 had been shot in the head , or ' domed ' in street slang			2
according to the @entity124 , @entity2 told her : ' i told you i domed him			0
' @entity101 , 19 at the time , pleaded guilty and received consecutive life terms for @entity13 's death and an unrelated aggravated robbery			0
@entity110 , 19 , and @entity109 , then 20 , pleaded guilty to aggravated robbery and received 10 - year prison sentences			2
@entity2 beame the 483rd inmate executed since @entity4 resumed carrying out capital punishment in 1982			1
he is among at least nine men with execution dates in the coming months .			0
