@entity0 is 90 minutes from his first final with @entity2 but his coach @entity3 could leave him out of the @entity6 semi-final second leg against @entity7 because he is one booking away from suspension			1
@entity0 has now scored five goals in his last five games but @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 could start the match if the @entity2 manager decides he wants his £ 75million striker saved for the final and not exposed to the risk of a yellow card that would rule him out of it			1
@entity2 will have reached their 38th @entity6 final if they can take the 3 - 1 first leg result over the line			1
no club in @entity26 has made it to more finals or won the competition more often than their 26 trophies			0
@entity2 's all - star front three could be broken up in the @entity6 semi-final second leg on wednesday @entity0 ( centre ) has been in great goalscoring form but is one yellow card away from suspension @entity7 have never made it to a big final and supporters were preparing for what will be one of the greatest nights in their history with yellow balloons placed on all the seats of the 20,000 @entity48 stadium			1
the last time they came close to reaching a final was 2005 when @entity52 was in charge			2
they lost 1 - 0 to @entity55 in their @entity57 semi-final first leg and won a last - gasp penalty in the second game only for @entity60 to save @entity62 ’s spot - kick and prevent the game going into extra time			2
they reached the @entity67 semi-final in 2010 but were beaten 5 - 1 in the first leg , with @entity69 scoring four and making the second game an irrelevance			0
@entity0 scored again at @entity72 on saturday but @entity2 may not risk him being suspended for the cup final @entity11 could come into the side to face @entity7 instead of @entity0 as @entity2 bid for a 38th @entity26 final a 2 - 0 win would see them go through on wednesday but @entity2 have not failed to score in a @entity6 game since the 2010 - 11 @entity6 final against @entity82 ’s @entity81			1
since then they have scored in 33 cup games			0
@entity7 will probably need to score three			2
they are at least buoyed by drawing with @entity81 at the weekend			0
‘ you do n’t win these games playing with your heart , you win them by being smart , ’ said @entity7 coach @entity85 on tuesday			2
he has @entity90 ’s hottest young striker at his disposal in the shape of @entity93 , who has scored 18 goals in all competitions this season and weighed in with 13 assists			0
his agent @entity98 – who was @entity99 ’s first agent – was talking up his client 's fondness for @entity81 in the lead up to this game			0
@entity2 must beware @entity104 's @entity93 ( centre ) , who is the hottest young striker in @entity90 @entity106 tucks away a goal against @entity108 in the @entity67 last week , and has 18 to his name this term @entity111 is a massive fan and wants the player at @entity114 next season , while @entity115 lead a clutch of @entity118 clubs who are keeping a close eye on the latest @entity122 talent discovered by @entity7			1
they are determined not to let their player leave for anything less than € 30m and they want to see the 21 - year - old help them to their first ever final before they even consider his possible departure .			0

@entity2 are weighing up whether to rest @entity0 against @entity7
@entity136 striker is one yellow card away from suspension in @entity6
a booking in wednesday 's semi-final would see him miss the final
@entity11 could start ahead of @entity0 *alongside* @entity13 and @entity12
