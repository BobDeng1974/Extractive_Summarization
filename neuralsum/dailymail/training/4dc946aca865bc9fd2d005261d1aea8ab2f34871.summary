the internet giant announced that it would give the money over the next four years to the @entity11 , a charity which seeks to police illegal images online			1
the money will enable the @entity16 - based watchdog to more than double its number of staff to nine full - time ‘ internet content analysts ’ and one part - time			2
@entity2 's £ 1million donation to to the fight against internet child abuse images was welcomed by the government as a ' first step ' to tackling the problem @entity2 acted after the revelation last week that , despite making great play of its support for the @entity11 , it donated just £ 20,000 a year			1
its new donation is worth £ 250,000 a year - more than ten times as much			0
critics last night said that though the larger amount was welcome , it was still a drop in the ocean compared to the firm ’s @entity35 profits - and was nothing when set alongside the huge amounts of tax it was dodging			0
in 2011 , @entity2 paid just £ 6million in corporation tax , despite sales worth £ 3.2billion			2
tonight the government welcomed the donation - but said it was only ‘ a first step ’			2
the donation emerged as @entity47 held a debate in the @entity49 , urging the government to take tougher action to protect children from accessing porn online , and to help crack down on the child abuse images on the net			0
they called on ministers to bring in new laws to ‘ set a timetable for the introduction of safe search as a default ’ setting for internet search engines , effective age verification checks on pornographic sites , and ‘ splash page warnings ’ , which will flash a warning that a web surfer is about to visit a child porn site			2
conservative mps refused to support the motion and it was defeated by more than 50 votes			0
but culture minister @entity73 did say that if internet firms failed to act , legislation could follow			1
during the debate , @entity76 , @entity47 mp for @entity77 , criticised @entity2 for its failure to take decent action to protect children			2
‘ @entity2 is one of the biggest hosts of child sexual abuse images , albeit inadvertently , and it should therefore accept the major responsibility for proactively monitoring and removing those images , ’ she told @entity82			2
‘ if @entity2 spent as much money on monitoring and removing illegal child sexual abuse images as it does on paying accountants to avoid tax in the @entity35 , it might go some way towards living up to its motto , “ do n’t be evil ” ? ’ @entity2 had previously donated just £ 20,000 to the charity - equivalent to 90 seconds ' profit web companies are under increased scrutiny following the conviction of @entity99 , who was jailed for life for the murder of five - year - old @entity99			1
he had collected a ‘ library ’ of sickening images by searching for simple terms on @entity2 and @entity105 in the weeks before the abduction			0
both he and @entity109 , who murdered 12 - year - old @entity109 , had no previous convictions for sexual offences and progressed from viewing child porn on the internet to committing child murder			0
the @entity11 has been under increasing pressure in recent years			1
last year , reports of child abuse sites soared by 40 per cent compared with the year before , to 40,000 - or 150 a day			0
chief executive @entity119 welcomed the extra money , which she said was almost the equivalent of a whole year ’s running costs for the @entity11			1
‘ this is an incredibly generous donation and @entity2 is demonstrating moral leadership in the field , ’ she said			1
‘ this contribution will significantly boost our work to meet our vision eliminating online child sexual abuse content			0
we are experts at doing this and like any organisation we can do more , with more resource ’			0
@entity134 , of @entity2 , said : ‘ we have a zero - tolerance policy on child sexual abuse content			0
the @entity11 are essential partners in our fight to rid the internet of this illegal material by providing us with lists of web pages that we block from search results			1
’ @entity2 has been under increased pressure since the murders of @entity99 , left , and @entity109 , right a spokesman for the @entity146 said : ‘ it ’s good news @entity2 have responded to next week ’s summit so positively by donating £ 1million to the @entity11 , but it ’s just a first step			1
‘ parents are rightly worried about what their children have access to online and given the proliferation of child abuse imagery , we need a committed emphasis on tackling the problem			0
’ @entity161 , from the @entity162 ’ @entity163 on internet safety , said : ‘ this is a fantastic gesture by @entity2 , and it has got to be applauded			1
