by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 22:59 est , 21 april 2012 updated : 09:24 est , 22 april 2012 an emaciated stuffed lion lies on an exhibit cobbled together from crates and shipping pallet , flies hovering over its mangy coat			0
nearby , a monkey missing limbs is frozen in a mummified gaze ; a porcupine 's brittle spines protrude from its lifeless corpse			0
the animals are among those exhibited at the @entity16 zoo in the impoverished @entity17 - where zookeepers , to avoid smuggling animals across borders , stuff and embalm those that die and return them to their enclosures			1
mummified : @entity26 zoo owner @entity25 holds a taxidermy monkey at the @entity16 zoo , on the southern @entity17 there is a unique afterlife for animals who die in the dilapidated park , giving visitors the unusual zoo experience of petting wild animals			1
but because taxidermy in the largely isolated @entity26 territory is not advanced and expertise and materials are in short supply , the experience can be grim			1
flies swarm around some of the 10 animals that have been embalmed so far			1
the makeshift cages housing the exhibits — fashioned from fencing salvaged from @entity48 settlements that @entity49 dismantled in 2005 — are littered with empty soda cans and other trash			0
the zoo 's 65 live animals , which include ostriches , monkeys , turtles , deer , a llama , a lion and a tiger , do n't fare much better			1
during a recent visit , children poked chocolate , potato chips and bread through the wire			0
there 's no zookeeper on the premises			0
@entity17 has no government body that oversees zoos , and medical treatment is done by consulting over the phone with zoo veterinarians in @entity75			1
still , the zoo is one of the few places of entertainment here in @entity16 , a city of 200,000 people at the southern end of the @entity17			1
it 's one of five zoos in the @entity17 , a densely populated coastal enclave of 1.7million people ruled by @entity88 @entity87 militants			1
@entity89 : @entity26 schoolchildren watch zoo owner @entity25 pet a mummified lion at the zoo , where animals are stuffed and placed back in their enclosures after they die emaciated : children enter the enclosure of a stuffed lion , whose ribs are visible from outside the cage owner @entity25 said he opened the ' @entity101 ' in 2007 , only to lose a number of animals during @entity49 's military offensive against @entity87 that began in december 2008			1
during the three - week offensive , launched in response to rocket attacks on @entity49 , @entity25 said he could not reach the zoo , and many animals died of neglect and starvation			1
' the idea to mummify animals started after the @entity17 war because a number of animals like the lion , the tiger , monkeys and crocodiles died , ' he said			1
' so we asked around and we learned from the @entity122 how to start			0
' formaldehyde and sawdust provided the basic tools , though @entity25 acknowledges he is no expert			0
a hole in the porcupine 's head is impossible not to notice			0
@entity17 's zoos are used to resorting to odd ways to get by amid the territory 's multiple woes			1
in 2009 , a zoo in @entity134 exhibited white donkeys painted with black stripes to look like zebras because it was too expensive to replace two zebras who were neglected during the @entity49 offensive			0
since @entity87 violently took control of @entity17 in 2007 , @entity49 has blocked @entity17 's ports , waters and all but one border crossing into @entity49			1
@entity75 has also restricted movement through its border crossing , meaning new animals must be smuggled at great expense through an elaborate network of underground tunnels on the @entity17 - @entity75 border			1
swarms : flies buzz around a tiger that lies frozen inside a nearby cage at the @entity16 zoo attraction : the zoo is one of the few places of entertainment in @entity16 , a city of 200,000 people @entity25 said all of his animals except the birds came through the tunnels			1
preserving dead zoo animals is not new to @entity26			2
in the @entity170 city of @entity171 , zoo veterinarian @entity168 turned to taxidermy nine years ago when a giraffe named @entity173 died during the second @entity26 uprising against @entity49			2
@entity168 , who had extensive training and experience in taxidermy from years working in @entity178 , stuffed @entity173 and moved him to the zoo 's museum			2
today that museum includes a hyena , wolf , birds , camel , raccoons and a tiger			0
fighting with @entity49 has since subsided and the zoo maintains close connections with the @entity191 outside @entity192			0
but administrators say that @entity49 restrictions still make it cumbersome to get new animals			2
' we have more variations and different species as preserved animals than we have living , ' said @entity201 , the zoo 's financial director			2
' if there will be more restrictions we may end up calling it preserved animals zoo			2
' exhibit : a porcupine is frozen against a wall with pots and other stuffed animals in another display conditions in @entity16 — and its zoo — are far worse			2
whereas @entity168 is a veterinarian and professional taxidermist , @entity215 is untrained			0
' i use many ingredients for the embalming , not one or two , and the ingredients and method will vary from animal to animal , ' @entity168 said			0
' it 's not enough to just go read on the @entity226			0
' and @entity25 does not have the contacts with @entity49 zoos that @entity171 has , a reflection of @entity17 's near - complete separation from @entity49			1
like the other zoos in @entity17 , the @entity16 facility is virtually unsupervised			1
there is no animal rights movement in the territory			2
@entity236 , director of the veterinary services department in @entity17 's ministry of agriculture , said , ' we have humble capabilities , ' but the ministry encourages zoos			1
however somber the @entity16 zoo , it does offer entertainment to children			0
@entity247 , 14 , snapped pictures of the animals with his mobile phone			2
' i have been to this place before years ago but this is my first time seeing mummified animals , ' he said			0
' they look like they are asleep			0
i will print out the pictures of me standing next to the lion and put it on my wall			0
it will be fun to show it to my younger brothers			0

taxidermy has become a way for zookeepers to get past territory woes
