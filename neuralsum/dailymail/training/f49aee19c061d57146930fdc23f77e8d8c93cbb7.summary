by @entity0 published : 19:50 est , 8 june 2013 updated : 19:50 est , 8 june 2013 male train drivers in @entity2 have found a novel way to work around a shorts ban during the summer months - by wearing skirts			1
drivers on the @entity8 line north of @entity9 are required to wear long trousers or skirts to work and shorts are not allowed			1
as a result , a dozen workers have been working in skirts to keep cool during the summer months when temperatures in their cabins can hit 35 degrees			0
cooling off : as @entity20 , 30 , and his colleague @entity21 , 32 , are not allowed shorts while driving @entity8 in @entity9 , they wear skirts to work train company @entity24 has said they have no problem with men wearing skirts , saying the uniforms represent their company , no matter the sex of the person wearing them			1
‘ our thinking is that one should look decent and proper when representing @entity24 and the present uniforms do that			2
' if the man only wants [ to wear ] a skirt then that is ok , ’ @entity24 communications manager @entity36 told local newspaper @entity41 ‘ to tell them to do something else would be discrimination			0
’ dress code : @entity9 train drivers are allowed to wear skirts or trousers , whether they are man or woman , as long as they do not go for shorts it can get really hot on the trains , ' driver @entity20 , 30 , told newspaper @entity54			1
' a skirt is nice and trousers are too hot			0
' ' today a man in his 40s collected his uniform skirt , but other than that it 's mostly us youngsters , ' he added			0
@entity24 has announced that there will be a meeting in september to discuss future rules on uniforms - so for summer 2013 , it seems to be skirts or nothing .			2

train drivers ' uniforms banned shorts , only allowing trousers and skirts
so a dozen male drivers at @entity9 train company went for the skirts
@entity24 says as long as they stick to the uniforms , they are fine
