every epic journey starts with a single , small step			0
not necessarily from the canteen of a car plant outside @entity4 , but hey ho			0
@entity5 , the @entity6 manager , is used to playing the hand he has been dealt and on monday that meant fronting up his @entity10 squad , not at @entity11 or @entity12 , or even on stage at the @entity14 as in previous years , but at a @entity16 factory off junction 10 of the @entity18			1
the modern @entity19 are really spoiled for choice when it comes to suitable venues			0
they have dramatic locations , magnificent backdrops that would speak of this fine game and its history			0
instead they just go with the dough			0
decision time : @entity5 has named a young @entity6 squad for the @entity10 in @entity32 this summer helping hand : @entity5 arrives at @entity4 for the @entity6 announcement so @entity4 it is			1
maybe , occasionally , in a quiet corner , a man in a blazer wonders why nobody takes his employers seriously as football ’s governors and reformers anymore , but then the marketing department bounce en route to another sponsored cocktail hour and the moment soon passes			0
@entity47 , the @entity19 chairman , announced his commission of all the talents at a lunch sponsored by @entity16 , too			0
and in @entity10 year , it is time again to sell @entity6 by the pound			1
there is a @entity54 opposite the @entity16 head office and the council were dredging the nearby canal of shopping trolleys when @entity5 arrived at lunchtime in a @entity61 hatchback			1
‘ refined , comfortable and pretty good to drive , ’ what car ? says of the @entity61			0
against that , it argues that resale values are poor , the smaller engines are short of motorway pace and bulky windscreen pillars obscure the view			0
so a mixed bag really			0
much like the @entity6 team			1
used to be famous for rust , but consumers complained and they sorted it out			0
now there is youth , pace and promise in @entity5 ’s squad , but dark memories , too			1
young guns : @entity82 ( left ) and @entity83 both made @entity5 's 23 - man @entity6 squad rewarded : @entity86 enjoyed a fine season with @entity88 and is off to the @entity10 with @entity6 @entity6 had a golden generation before , remember , and it turned out to be overvalued			1
it is the determination to reject this tainted era that has led to such clamour for @entity5 to go with youth			1
and so it begins again			0
@entity82 , @entity83 , @entity95 , @entity86 and the rest are only getting the same publicity that once greeted @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101			1
if they lose , experience suggests it will end the same way			0
except nobody can then argue that @entity5 needs to bring on the kids to solve this crisis			1
he did that , on monday			0
there are only six players in the 23 who have gone to a @entity10 finals tournament yet @entity5 is far from gambling			1
the debate over @entity95 versus @entity116 aside , there is not a young player in this group who has not been included on merit			1
these are not kids , but the best @entity6 have got			1
they just happen to be young			1
@entity5 lists pragmatism as one of his personal qualities and he has not turned daredevil overnight			2
come at the debate from another direction			0
take out @entity86 , @entity82 , @entity83 , even @entity131			0
who would @entity6 pick ? @entity133 ? @entity134 ? @entity135 ? @entity136 ? the young players are better , the best @entity5 has available			1
this is no throw of the dice			0
this is @entity141 football , 2014			0
not so golden ? @entity100 , @entity99 , @entity142 , @entity98 and @entity101 the sole controversy is the exclusion of @entity116 at left back			1
many would have him not just in the squad but in the starting xi against @entity148 on june 14 , when a belt and braces approach may be required			0
yet it is hard to argue against @entity5 ’s decision to go with @entity95			1
he described the young players as imposing themselves on this squad and a teenager from @entity155 seems a more obvious understudy to @entity157 than a 33 - year - old with 107 caps			2
bizarrely , though , having made the hard call , @entity5 spent much of the afternoon presenting the case for @entity116			1
from a position where @entity6 had good left backs in such number that some were advocating picking three just to fit them all in , @entity5 is now in a position where if @entity157 limped off against @entity167 this month , @entity6 ’s left back in @entity32 would be @entity95 , who has played one game , with @entity169 of @entity170 as his understudy and still waiting for his @entity6 debut			1
believers in @entity174 will already be contemplating the inevitable twang of an @entity88 hamstring			0
‘ yes , i ’ve heard the view that @entity116 would be the answer if @entity157 got injured , ’ said @entity5			1
‘ and he would be , without a doubt			0
an injury against @entity167 would make the choice of @entity95 a very bad selection			2
but @entity116 is n’t really a cover player			2
end of an era : @entity116 retired from international football after being left out of the @entity6 squad big chance : @entity95 will be @entity6 's back - up left back behind @entity157 this summer ‘ everyone knows what @entity116 is and what @entity116 can do			1
he is a no 1 man			0
when i decided @entity157 was no 1 , i decided the next player would have to be @entity95			2
‘ circumstances could make the decision very good or very bad			0
if @entity157 does n’t get injured early on , if we go through the @entity10 with him playing the majority of games and @entity95 coming on and doing well , it makes it a good selection			1
’ @entity10 rules mean that an injury to @entity157 before june 2 would mean a battlefield promotion for @entity169			2
after that , @entity116 could be considered from outside the standby squad , the problem being his decision to announce international retirement after @entity5 ’s rejection			1
are the lines of communication still open , pending an emergency ? ‘ you would have to ask @entity116 that , ’ stalled @entity5			1
‘ i would like to think so			0
‘ he ’s a very experienced player and a very good one but do you think , when you have a player of his ability , you invite him along to a tournament on the basis that he might get the odd game ? is that the correct thing to do ? ’ ‘ we have another very talented player in @entity95 , the subject of a £ 27million bid from one of the best teams in the world , who has had a fantastic season and will have a fantastic future			2
@entity228 back the years : @entity5 's @entity6 squad is considerably younger than @entity230 's in 2010 ‘ you ca n’t cover both eventualities			1
if you ’re going to take a player like @entity95 , without experience , you really need three left backs : two seniors because of injury and the other one			2
you ca n’t do that			0
‘ twenty - three players did not give me that luxury			2
i ca n’t take them all			0
we might have been better off with @entity116 , i ca n’t deny that			2
i ’m certain @entity95 would n’t deny that if circumstances occur			2
‘ then again , we might go through the tournament and get congratulated because we gave a young player a big chance			2
’ this is a second honeymoon for @entity5 and he is enjoying the changing public perception of him as a cavalier , a believer in youth			2
@entity230 ’s @entity10 squad in 2010 was the oldest to depart these shores , @entity5 ’s , at 26 , the youngest since 1958			1
that group , average age 24.8 , contained only four players with caps in double figures and five that had never played a game for @entity6			1
it was the beginning of a golden age that would see @entity6 win the @entity10 eight years later			1
and how many of the class of 1958 were in sir @entity263 ’s glorious band in 1966 ? one			0
you see , sometimes it is n’t about kids , experience , planning or continuity			0
sometimes you just pick the best 23 players and that works as well .			2

@entity6 have a new golden generation heading to the @entity10 in @entity32
these are the best players @entity6 have ; they just happen to be young
@entity5 was right to select @entity95 over @entity116
