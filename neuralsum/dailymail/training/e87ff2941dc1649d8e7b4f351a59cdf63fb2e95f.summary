by @entity0 published : 17:45 est , 25 october 2013 updated : 12:56 est , 27 october 2013 students could face a further £ 1,000 - a - year rise in tuition fees to help fill a £ 10billion black hole in the main pension scheme for university staff , experts warn			1
they say the institutions will have to raise their charges and increase the contributions from lecturers to plug a ‘ very worrying ’ deficit much higher than previously thought			1
the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) is the biggest pension fund in the country with 303,000 members – most of them on gold - plated final salary pensions			1
squeezed : students could be hit with a £ 1,000 increase in tuition fees to plug the deficit in staff pensions @entity12 put its shortfall at £ 7.9billion in a report last month			1
but pensions consultant @entity25 , a former finance director of boots , says the real deficit is £ 2.6billion higher			1
he examined the data for an investigation by @entity31 ’s @entity30			0
using the same analysis methods that private companies use , he put the deficit at £ 10.5billion			2
to make good that deficit over 20 years would require a near doubling of contributions to £ 1.8billion , he said			1
that could be achieved by a rise in tuition fees of up to £ 1,000 a year			2
‘ there is a whole degree of denial , ’ mr @entity25 said			0
‘ @entity12 is in denial about its real financial situation			1
' we have seen private member schemes closing to new members and existing members wholesale over the last few years			2
‘ there will be repercussions for the university sector			0
all we ’re doing is bequeathing a very real problem to our children			2
’ higher education minister @entity55 said it would be wrong to pass on the cost to students the @entity12 has assets of £ 37.9billion – more than three times what taxpayers spend every year on higher education			1
however , it has admitted it has a huge deficit			2
professor @entity65 , director of the @entity66 , said the size of the scheme ’s black hole was concerning			0
‘ it ’s very worrying now and it looks even more worrying for the future , ’ he said			0
‘ it would be an added cost that we would have to cover either from tuition fees or some other source , either philanthropy or earnings from consulting or other enterprises			0
’ but higher education minister @entity55 told @entity30 it would be wrong to pass on the cost of higher pensions to students			2
‘ universities are independent autonomous bodies and they know one of their financial responsibilities is to stand behind their pensions and tackle their deficits , ’ he said			0
‘ it would be wrong to expect students to bail out pension deficits to support pension schemes that are far more generous than students are likely to enjoy when they ’re older			0
’ as well as the threat of higher tuition fees – which can already cost as much as £ 9,000 a year – university staff could face the prospect of having to pay more for their pensions			1
they are already planning to strike next week over pay			0
@entity104 , chief executive of @entity12 , said that higher contributions or cuts to benefits had to be considered			1
‘ it ’s been done in 2008			0
it ’s been done in 2011			0
we ’re looking at it again now , ’ he added			0
@entity111 , chief executive of @entity112 , denied yesterday that tuition fees will have to rise to plug the black hole			0
‘ employers have already taken significant steps to address the fund deficit and will continue to work on long - term solutions to ensure that @entity12 remains sustainable and affordable , ’ she said			1
‘ the range of challenges facing the fund are not exclusive to @entity12 and impact on all pension schemes			1
there is no question that tuition fees will be increased to plug the @entity12 funding shortfall			1
’ a @entity12 spokeswoman said : ' @entity12 has been entirely transparent about the deficit figures and provides comprehensive estimates to institutions on an annual basis			2
' @entity12 has made changes to both benefits and contribution levels in recent years to deal with historic deficits and will continue to work with employers and members ’ representatives to agree a recovery plan which is commensurate with the long - term nature of the scheme			1
the employers have made it clear there is no suggestion that tuition fees will be increased to provide additional funding for the scheme			0

the @entity12 is @entity150 *'s* biggest pension fund
it has 303,000 members , most of them on gold - plated final salary pensions
it puts its shortfall at £ 7.9bn but experts say the real deficit is £ 2.6bn higher
to repair it would require a near doubling of contributions
