most foods come with use - by dates , but the majority of the time this is simply a guide , making it difficult to know when food is safe to eat			0
this is a particular problem with poultry and other meats , but could soon be a thing of the past			0
scientists have developed a gadget that ' sniffs ' meat to test its freshness , and warns you if its gone off , or needs to be put back in the fridge			2
the device takes a reading of the air and sends it a phone or tablet app via @entity35 to take a reading , open the app and press the get button on the top of the @entity23 device			1
the device is fitted with gas , temperature and humidity sensors			2
it works by taking a sample of the air around the meat and scans for potentially volatile compounds that rotting meat produces			1
@entity23 works with pork , poultry , beef and fish			1
this data is transmitted from peres to the app via @entity35 and the results can be shared to @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59			0
it can detect whether the product is fresh , whether it may have been left unrefrigerated , and warn if there is a risk of food poisoning			1
it will track changes in freshness to give users an idea how long the food will last , and sends these readings to a smartphone app. to take a reading , users open the app and press the ' get ' button on the top of the device			1
the peres is fitted with gas , temperature and humidity sensors that take a sample of the air around the meat			1
it scans this sample for potentially volatile compounds that rotting meat produce , and the device works with pork , poultry , beef and fish			1
user then get a reading on the app , and the device can detect whether the product is fresh , if it may have been left unrefrigerated , and will warn them if there is a risk of food poisoning			1
this data is transmitted from peres to the app via @entity35 and the results can be shared to @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 - if you particularly like discussing mouldy food with your friends			0
peres was developed by @entity108 - based @entity107 with scientists from the @entity110			0
the prototype took a year to develop			0
@entity107 ‘ s ceo @entity112 said the idea for the device came about after he suffered from a serious bout of food poisoning			0
the app , pictured , detects whether the product is fresh , if it may have been left unrefrigerated , and warns users if there is a risk of food poisoning			2
@entity23 works with pork , poultry , beef and fish			1
the readings can be shared to @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 - if you really want to discuss mouldy food with your friends the device will retail for $ 150 ( £ 90 ) with free shipping to the @entity132 and @entity133			1
shipping to the rest of the world will cost an extra $ 15 ( £ 9 )			2
final samples are expected to be shipped by november this year and the device will be sold in black , blue , green , pink , white , pictured the @entity23 device , pictured top , is fitted with gas , temperature and humidity sensors , pictured bottom ‘ we had prepared and eaten food in our home just like any other day , but when my family and i all suffered food poisoning we realised there must have been something wrong with the food that had n’t been obvious at the time			1
' the @entity156 claims more than 200 diseases are spread through food , and more than 5,000 deaths in the @entity132 last year were linked to food borne illnesses			2
‘ that was when i first envisioned a tool that could check whether the food i was preparing was as fresh as it seemed , so i could be sure i was making healthy meals for my family , ' continued @entity112			0
@entity112 has now set up an @entity165 campaign to raise money to further develop the device and fund its production			0
he is looking to raise $ 100,000 ( £ 60,000 ) and his current total stands at $ 14,890 ( £ 8,980 )			0
the campaign ends on may 11			0
if it achieves funding , @entity112 said the device will retail for $ 150 ( £ 90 ) with free shipping to the @entity132 and @entity133			1
shipping to the rest of the world will cost an extra $ 15 ( £ 9 )			2
final products are expected to be shipped by november and will be sold in black , blue , green , pink and white .			0

@entity23 works by scanning the air around meat for volatile compounds
rotting meat releases gases that are picked up by sensors in the device
the gadget takes a reading of the air and sends it a phone or tablet app
it can detect if the food is fresh , should be refrigerated , or has gone off
device is set to retail for $ 150 ( £ 90 ) with free shipping to the @entity132 and @entity200 and goes on sale from november
