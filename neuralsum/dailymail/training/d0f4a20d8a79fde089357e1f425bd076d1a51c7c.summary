the @entity1 's @entity0 has come out with the firm recommendation that we should all be aiming to cut our sugar intake by half on paper , you would think it had been a good week for those with serious concerns about the amounts of sugar that so many of us are consuming			1
on wednesday , for instance , no less an authority than the @entity1 ’s @entity0 came out with the firm recommendation that we should all be aiming to cut our sugar intake by half and that children should not be given fizzy drinks at all			1
that came just one day after dame @entity21 , the government ’s chief medical officer , proposed that a sugar tax needed to be introduced if we wanted to cut sugar intake and reduce obesity			1
and it came on the same day that an eminent @entity29 cardiovascular research scientist warned that the long - running demonisation of fats , and saturated fats in particular , could be entirely misplaced			0
the real killer , according to dr @entity35 , particularly when it comes to heart disease and type 2 diabetes — those two scourges of the modern age — is sugar			1
after these three dramatic interventions , surely it is game , set and match for those of us who would like to see sugar consumption seriously reduced ? well , as a cardiologist and science director of the campaigning health group , @entity51 , i can tell you that we ’re certainly not dancing in the streets just yet			1
for despite the mounting evidence of the damage to health done by sugar — evidence that many working in the field would now describe as overwhelming — this was the response from the prime minister ’s official spokesman on wednesday : ‘ what we are doing is working with the industry			0
you have already seen commitments from retailers and food manufacturers to reduce levels of salt , to remove some artificial fats , to reduce calorie content and improve labelling			1
’ it ’s the first sentence — ‘ what we are doing is working with the industry ’ — that gives the game away because it ’s absolutely true			0
the links between government ministers and food manufacturers , and indeed between scientists who are supposed to advise the government and the food manufacturers , are nothing short of astonishing			1
for these are the same food manufacturers who have been adding extra sugar to processed foods , confectionery and fizzy drinks for decades			1
the @entity94 , the biggest celebration of fitness and health in this country for decades , was sponsored by @entity99 and @entity100 's it is the closeness of those links that are widely blamed for a compulsory food traffic - light system — an idea once enthusiastically championed by the @entity105 and designed to give shoppers an idea of the nutritional value ( or not ) of the item they were about to buy — quietly dying a death soon after the @entity112 came to power			1
but then what do we expect when the @entity94 , the biggest celebration of fitness and health in this country for decades , was sponsored by @entity99 and @entity118 ? and what do we expect when , as this newspaper revealed only last month , fast - food companies , supermarkets and restaurant chains have had dozens of meetings with ministers since the last election ? @entity127 ’s , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 and , almost inevitably , the ubiquitous @entity100 ’s are among those who have had the chance to bend the ministerial ear since 2010			2
government ministers hate their close links to the food industry being exposed by the media			1
but these links exist and are one reason , i believe , for the government ’s lax approach			2
too often , when a minister pronounces on dietary matters , i wonder whether he is just saying what his chums in the food industry have told him to say			0
meanwhile , rates of obesity , type 2 diabetes , heart disease , stroke and cancer — all conditions with increasingly strong links to sugar intake — continue to rise			1
influential organisations such as the @entity158 have a membership that reads like the @entity160 of the sugar industry - @entity99 and @entity129 among them the @entity162 , the industry lobby group , for instance , has had 16 meeting with ministers since the last election and an astonishing 99 with @entity142 officials			1
by contrast , we in @entity51 have had just one , although a second , we ’re told , is in the pipeline			0
there ’s no way of knowing who has met whom , but there is also no hiding the conflicts of interest			0
@entity180 , special adviser to former health secretary @entity181 , for instance , came from a pr firm that has @entity99 , @entity183 and @entity128 on its books , although the pr company has always denied that mr @entity180 worked on two of those accounts			0
but its website did highlight his potential for linking the interests of its clients with @entity142 policy			2
even mr @entity181 , himself , architect of the government ’s ‘ @entity196 ’ , which effectively handed responsibility for the levels of fats , salt and sugar in food to the food manufacturers themselves , has past links with the industry			1
in 2009 , while still @entity207 , he was director of a marketing firm where clients included @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity210 and @entity212 ’s @entity211			0
earlier this year , @entity215 ’s @entity214 programme revealed that five of the eight members of the government ’s @entity218 ( @entity218 ) received substantial funding from large confectionary companies			0
the real killer , according to dr @entity35 , particularly when it comes to heart disease and type 2 diabetes - those two scourges of the modern age - is sugar these included the committee ’s chairman , professor @entity230 , who receives money not only from @entity233 , the world ’s biggest ice - cream maker , but also from @entity99 and @entity130			1
his committee colleague , professor @entity236 , one of the government ’s most trusted advisers when it comes to diet , sugar and heart disease , has had his research funded to the tune of £ 4.5 million by the sugar giant @entity245			1
there is , of course , no evidence — or indeed , any suggestion — that members of the @entity218 have ever put the interests of the companies that sponsor them first			0
but the committee has gone against prevailing scientific opinion as rates of obesity and diet - related diabetes have grown and its reports are said to be one of the main reasons why official health advice on the amounts of sugar we eat have n’t changed in 11 years			2
the @entity0 is absolutely right , we must cut down on our consumption of dietary sugar this advice suggests that an individual can consume a staggering 22 teaspoons of sugar a day as part of a guideline daily amount			2
on wednesday , the @entity0 suggested that figure should be just six teaspoons			2
the difference is huge and , in the face of the dramatic intervention by the @entity0 , i wonder if the @entity218 ’s committee ’s recommendations will suddenly be changing now ? on wednesday , i was due to go on @entity280 to discuss the @entity0 ’s new recommendations but the debate was cancelled when the @entity162 ( @entity162 ) withdrew , apparently after discovering that i would be up against them			2
had they turned up , i might have pointed out that the relentless drive for profit among food companies had contributed to unnecessary suffering for millions of people and thousands of deaths that might otherwise have been prevented			0
moreover , there is growing evidence that not all calories are the same ( contrary to what the food companies will tell you )			0
research from @entity300 last year showed that for every 150 sugar calories ( from a can of @entity99 , for example ) consumed above the recommended daily calorie intake , there is an 11-fold increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes compared with 150 ‘ excess ’ calories consumed from a non-sugar source			2
that increase is completely independent of body weight and levels of exercise : in other words , we are all vulnerable			0
yet still the government does nothing			0
and as long as influential organisations such as the @entity158 have a membership that reads like the @entity160 of the sugar industry — @entity99 , @entity321 ’s @entity118 , @entity322 and @entity129 among them — and the @entity323 can promote an @entity325 plate that includes a full - sugar can of cola and fruit juice as part of a balanced diet , i fear that wo n’t change			0
but change it must , for our health , and particularly the health of our children , depends upon it			0
the @entity0 is absolutely right , we must cut down on our consumption of dietary sugar and it ’s high - time the government cast aside its cosy relationship with the food industry , faced up to the unpalatable scientific facts and did the right thing .			1
