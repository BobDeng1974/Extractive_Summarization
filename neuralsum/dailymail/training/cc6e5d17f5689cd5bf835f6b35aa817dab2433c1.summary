recovery : the pound has gained steadily against the euro over the last eighteen months			0
@entity68 made further gains against the single currency today in the wake of the @entity3 announcement the @entity136 has until now resisted pressure to let the franc float against the euro but the prospect of outright money - printing - which devalues a currency - by the @entity159 as early as next week broke the bank 's resolve			1

' @entity128 's shares and bond yields tumbling as jittery markets reacted negatively to the unexpected move			0
