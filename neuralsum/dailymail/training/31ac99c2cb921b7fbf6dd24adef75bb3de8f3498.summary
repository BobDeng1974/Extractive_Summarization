by @entity0 published : 11:10 est , 10 october 2013 updated : 16:57 est , 10 october 2013 troubling : the council heavily criticised for failing to protect ' @entity2 ' - @entity3 - has been found wanting in another child abuse case a toddler was sent home to be beaten horrifically by his abusive parents after a series of blunders by social workers from the same council which failed @entity2 the child was twice taken to hospital with more than 50 injuries after being beaten with a belt , a stick and a cable – but both times staff at @entity19 allowed him to be sent back to be tortured again			1
the case , which emerged in a scathing report yesterday , is the latest in a series of failings by the scandal - hit council			1
while the child ’s life was saved , his neglect chillingly echoes the death of 17 - month - old @entity3 , whose mother @entity30 was this week cleared for release after serving just four years behind bars			1
in the more recent case , the boy , @entity34 , was taken to hospital at least three times over eight months			1
on one occasion he had more than 50 bruises after being repeatedly beaten up by his @entity41 parents			0
a review found multiple failings by doctors , police and social workers for not intervening sooner and failing to learn from what happened to @entity2 ‘ @entity3 died three years before the first detected injuries to @entity49 it is worrying to find compelling evidence of individual and systemic failures within and between services so soon after that high - profile case , ’ the report , by the @entity53 , said			1
‘ one might expect , if anything , that agencies would be over sensitive to the possibility of abuse going undetected			2
’ chairman @entity60 added : ‘ what is clear is because of failings in the system this child suffered physical abuse that could have been prevented			2
’ @entity34 ’s injuries were first seen at @entity67 in june 2010			2
he had bruising around his eyes , forehead and nose as well as injuries to his chest and hip area			0
his @entity41 stepfather , a heroin user identified as mr @entity76 , claimed the boy often ran around the house and ‘ bangs and hits himself on the wall ’			2
under the microscope : staff at @entity19 persistently returned a battered child - child t - to his parents despite him having terrible injuries track record : @entity88 was failed by @entity89 's @entity19 in a case that shocked @entity91 and led to protests after an assessment , the consultant paediatrician wrongly faxed a report to @entity96			1
it said when police later visited the home , officers had ‘ no concerns ’ about the child ’s welfare or ‘ home conditions ’ with the mother and step - father , who are originally from @entity41			0
at follow - up meetings , no decisions were taken by social workers and police child abuse experts			0
at one point , mr @entity76 took his child to his gp under the premise he was concerned his child ‘ bruised easily ’			0
while a health worker noted he has ‘ quite uncommon injuries ’ for a child of his age , no one followed up the concerns three months later , during an appointment with a gp and a later one with a nurse at the surgery , he was found to have additional bruising to his back , arms and legs			0
in february 2011 , police were called to the family home and officers noticed @entity34 was extensively bruised			1
the next day he was taken by police to hospital where he was found to have more than 50 bruises of varying ages and sizes			0
indefinite sentences : @entity2 , right , allowed her boyfriend @entity2 , left , and his paedophile brother @entity141 to torture to death baby @entity3 he told the doctor he had been hit with a belt and a stick by mr @entity146 later that month , in an interview with a social worker , he said he had told his mother about being hit			1
he also said ‘ daddy ’ had hit him with a belt and cable			0
@entity34 ’s stepfather was sentenced to four years in prison in october 2011 for wilfully assaulting a young person under the age of 16 and will be deported			1
the boy ’s mother , referred to as ms b , is understood to have returned to @entity41			0
the boy , who is now six , was removed from the family home with his three siblings in 2011 – more than a year after the first abuse was noted			1
disgusted : local mp @entity164 said : ' it is just appalling @entity19 have become embroiled in another child abuse scandal ' they are now in care			1
the report found weaknesses across all the agencies involved in the child ’s case			2
it stated there was a ‘ reluctance to “ think the unthinkable ” and recognise all the adults in the family as perpetrators of abuse ’			0
the case comes 13 years after the death of eight - year - old @entity88 , who @entity19 also failed to protect when she was tortured and murdered by her great - aunt and her boyfriend			1
local mp @entity186 said : ‘ after these two horrendous failures , serious changes should have been made			0
‘ indeed , the review identifies features that are common between the @entity2 and the @entity34 cases			1
‘ what makes me even more upset and angry , is @entity19 ’s @entity195 leadership have repeatedly told us lessons had been learnt , and @entity198 had turned a corner			2
but this was evidently not true – now another child has paid the price			0
’ council leader @entity203 said : ‘ we fully accept the findings and apologise unreservedly for the failings set out in the report			0
‘ together with partner agencies , we could and should have intervened more swiftly			2
this case occurred during a period of rebuilding in our children ’s service			0
‘ we have been working hard over the past three years to make significant improvements , which have been recognised by @entity213			0
’ mixed messages : haringey social services have been forced to apologise again over an abuse case but maintains it is improving and changing			1

*unnamed* boy was taken to hospital twice but still sent home for more abuse
@entity19 criticised after brutal deaths of @entity3 and @entity88
@entity19 says sorry but @entity2 died three years before @entity34 's abuse
' it 's worrying to find compelling evidence of individual and systemic failures within and between services so soon after that case , ' report says
*bosses* say sorry and admit ' we could and should *'ve* intervened more swiftly '
