a spaghetti bolognese dinner between two flatmates turned nasty when one drunkenly attacked the other with a meat cleaver			1
@entity4 , 35 , had been living with @entity5 for around six months in @entity6 , @entity7 , when he savagely attacked his friend while chopping ingredients for their dinner			1
both men had been drinking vodka and @entity4 was also taking sedatives when he struck his friend of four years with the meat cleaver , causing injuries to his head and neck and leaving him ' lucky to be alive '			1
@entity19 ( pictured ) heard @entity4 had been living with @entity5 for around six months in @entity6 , @entity7 , when he attacked his friend while chopping ingredients for their dinner mr @entity5 , who was watching television when the attack took place on september 18 last year , managed to run from the flat covered in blood			1
but he was pursued by @entity4 , who held him up against a fence and shouted : ' what 's my name ? ' before punching him in the head			1
@entity4 also threatened witnesses who tried to help the victim			1
the men had previously downed several vodka red bulls each and @entity4 was also taking sedative tablets			1
@entity19 heard @entity4 emerged from the kitchen ' growling ' before attacking mr @entity5			1
@entity37 , prosecuting , said : ' he went up to mr @entity5 and started hitting him around the neck and head			1
' mr @entity5 saw blood on his hands			1
he felt it dripping down from his face			2
' ' he tried to push him away			2
he said : " we are mates			2
we are both on the same side "			2
mr @entity4 did n't stop			1
' @entity4 had been preparing a spaghetti bolognese for their dinner when he turned on his flatmate ' the victim could not remember anything else until he woke up in hospital with cuts to his neck , behind his left ear and above his left eye , which needed stitches			1
' mr @entity37 told the jury the ' very nasty attack ' could have had much more serious consequences			1
@entity4 claimed he was intoxicated due to the consumption of the tablets and alcohol which led to a state of ' automatism '			1
but mr @entity37 said : ' the prosecution say it was a voluntary act on his part			1
' this is not a case of someone who suddenly lost their inhibitions and did n't know what he was doing			2
' when he stabbed him he intended to cause him grievous bodily harm			1
someone who stabs someone multiple times with a meat cleaver intends to do someone really serious harm			1
' giving evidence mr @entity5 told the court he got on well with @entity4 , there were no issues between the pair and they would often enjoy watching television and playing video games together			1
he said : ' even on medication , he was always happy			2
' we were together all day			0
we went to the shop to get some drink and some mince for spaghetti bolognese			1
' i do n't remember how much we had to drink before we went			0
i think i had a couple of vodkas and @entity101			0
when we got back i went onto my tablet and played a game			0
' he did the same			0
we had a chat and a laugh			0
i do n't know how much we had to drink			0
i would say a fair bit			0
i am not really a drinker			0
' he was in the kitchen preparing dinner			2
i could hear him cutting up onion			0
he was popping in and out and chatting			0
there was nothing to indicate all was not well with his mind			0
' i remember him coming in and saying " it 's all your fault "			2
' i tried to calm him down and told him we are mates			0
he was holding a meat cleaver			1
' i got up and said : " what 's going on "			2
i just do n't remember much			0
i do n't remember being attacked , but i know i was			2
' all i know is i wanted to get out of the flat			0
i do n't remember going downstairs			0
i know i felt it			0
i do n't remember him hitting me			0
i just came round at the hospital			0
' mr @entity131 needed three stitches by his adam 's apple , seven on the side of his head and butterfly stitches on his eye			1
' they have all healed up , ' he added			0
' there is a little scar			0
' @entity4 denied causing grievous bodily harm but was found guilty by a jury at @entity19 and will be sentenced on april 27			1
detective constable @entity143 from @entity144 said : ' there is no doubt a substantial amount of alcohol , combined with a number of sedative pills proved to be a potent cocktail and played a part in @entity4 's state of mind that night			1
' however , that should in no way be used as an excuse			0
he was fully conscious and had in his possession a lethal weapon and using it meant he fully intended to cause harm			2
' it must have been a terrifying shock and ordeal to have seen someone change in that way and see them attacking you			0
' in fact , the victim was incredibly lucky the attack was not fatal			0
' i am pleased the jury were able to see the seriousness of the offence and convict him on the comprehensive evidence put before them			2
