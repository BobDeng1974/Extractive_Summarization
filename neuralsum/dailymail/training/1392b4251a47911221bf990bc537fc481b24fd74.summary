by @entity1 reporter a couple have revealed how their nine year old girl nearly lost her leg to bone cancer after doctors initially thought she had simply pulled a muscle			1
@entity9 was left in agony as a 22cm tumour grew on her left leg , but was told it was probably a sports injury after visiting her gp			1
her concerned parents , @entity15 , 36 , and @entity16 , 36 , assumed she was suffering from common growing pains			2
however , two weeks later when the pain got worse , they rushed her back to her doctor who recommended an x-ray of the youngster 's leg , which revealed the huge tumour on her femur			1
@entity9 , pictured following cancer treatment			1
doctors managed to save her leg and she is now on the road to recovery mother @entity29 believes had the tumour not been caught early in april this year , it could have proved fatal			1
she said : ' @entity9 had been doing lots of sports and complained that her leg was aching			1
' she did n't compete in the school cross country and i noticed as she walked back from watching it she was moving strangely			2
' i picked her up to put her in my lap and she screamed			0
' the doctor and us thought she had just pulled a muscle and we went away with painkillers			0
' it was just luck we found it and acted so quickly but we never thought for a moment it could be cancer			0
' we went back two weeks later and the gp suggested we go for an x-ray to be on the safe @entity47 hours later @entity9 and i were told they had found a tumour			1
in two weeks we had gone from having a healthy little girl to her having cancer			2
' we were left numb and speechless			2
we thought we 're going to wake up in a minute from all this but we just had to stay strong and be there for each other			0
' @entity9 was treated at @entity54 @entity9 's older sister @entity55 , 11 , and the family from @entity57 , @entity58 , were distraught as they awaited to find out how badly the osteosarcoma tumour had grown			1
after a nervous four weeks of chemotherapy @entity9 's treatment was successful but she faced losing the leg altogether			1
the following are symptoms of @entity65 ... the primary school pupil loved hockey , netball and running but was told for the leg to recover she would have to give up high impact sports			2
surgeons at the @entity73 , @entity74 , operated to insert a titanium endoprosthesis on the femur , a metal rod which will grow as she gets older			2
now after six months intensive surgery , further chemotherapy and lengthy hospital stays @entity9 says she is looking forward to getting better and starting to swim			1
around 450 cases of bone cancer are diagnosed among children and young people aged 10 to 24 each year			2
around 100 of these will be fatal			0
father @entity15 was overjoyed @entity9 has reacted so well to her treatment			1
he said : ' i thought when she first mentioned it that she just had growing pains			0
but it was likely she was born with the cancer and it lay dormant and with her growth spurts as she got older as a child triggered the bone cancer			0
' the tumour was 100 per cent removed and 100 per cent dead but the chemotherapy will continue until @entity99 when hopefully she will be given the all clear			2
@entity9 has donated her cancerous femur to science ' her school has been amazing			1
the teachers kept her desk clear and read out her name in the register , waiting for the day she returns			0

her bravery and confidence has shone through with hospital staff who ask her to talk to teenage children newly - admitted with cancer			0
@entity9 said : ' i 've missed school since and i 'm looking forward to getting back			1
' i tell people the massive scar on my leg is the result of a shark attack and that i beat the shark away ! ' this week is @entity135 and @entity9 revealed she donated her cancerous femur to science , in the hope other children benefit from research on it			1
