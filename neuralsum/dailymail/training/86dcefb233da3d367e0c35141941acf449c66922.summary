a man has made his adorable pet cat the star of a series of surreal images			0
@entity5 , 38 , a former cameraman , used a mix of sets , green screen and photoshop to imagine the tiny kitten in unusual scenes			1
these range from sipping a beer at the bar to escaping the clutches of a giant squid			0
after watching the amusing moggy 's face as it explored new areas and objects of his flat , @entity5 soon noticed his ability to seemingly express a wide range of emotions			2
drowning his sorrows : @entity27 the @entity26 cat looks mournful as he gazes at a photo of a pretty kitten here escaping the clutches of a giant squid , @entity27 the cat is captured in a variety of bizarre locations in the photos the dramatic squid scene was in fact created rather simply against a mini green screen but the @entity39 @entity26 cat is more to the @entity40 than a fun photography project : he 's helped him keep busy and stay positive after being made redundant from his job at a @entity45 tv network			1
@entity5 is now on a mission to get the fluffy kitten 's face seen all around the world after creating calenders and postcards of @entity27 on crowd funding site , @entity53			1

@entity5 says little @entity27 has helped him keep busy and stay positive after being made redundant from his job at a @entity45 tv network the former cameraman sometimes uses sets , such as this nest of wool , for the cute pictures @entity5 now hopes @entity27 will find worldwide fame through calenders and postcards @entity5 says the kitten 's natural expressions lend themselves to a variety of odd scenarios ' watching him i thought , what if he could experience fantastic or absurd situations , so that was my starting point			1
' since the beginning he always had very expressive reactions , when he 's tired he almost looks angry and when he 's relaxed his eyebrows make him look sad			0
' the images are half real and half digital , at first i draw a basic sketch of the image i want to create and then i make a list of real things i need for the set			0
some of the photos see @entity27 re-enact famous film scenes such as the shower scene from @entity89 little @entity27 looks set to be the next feline hit as @entity5 hopes to raise money on crowd funding site , @entity53 ' i worked as a cameraman for 12 years , but a year and a half ago , the tv network i was working for fired 900 workers			2
' i felt desperate and unfortunately found myself with too much free time so i began taking pictures of @entity27 as a way of filling my free time			0
' @entity27 is so curious , that 's why i never let him on each set until i am ready to take the photos , his first reactions on set are the most amusing			0
' everybody loves the pictures and they always ask me if @entity27 's expressions are real but believe me , all his gestures are completely real			1
