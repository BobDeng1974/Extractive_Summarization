by @entity0 @entity2 's gregarious mayor @entity1 may yet regret being such a naughty boy			1
one of the city 's top fetish queens is planning on whipping its administration into shape by challenging @entity9 for the mayoralty			2
@entity11 - known to her clients as @entity13 * * * * - is a professional dominatrix and believes she can run @entity16 's most populous city better than the controversial incumbent			1
ms @entity11 , a mother of two grown up children and grandmother of one , runs a busy @entity2 dungeon and her plans to open a chain of dominatrix schools are being looked at by the angel investors of @entity32 's @entity45 she even claims to have clients at @entity47 , although she declines to name them			1
with campaign slogans including ' i 'll whip this city into shape ' and ' i mean business ' , ms @entity11 says she is ' a warrior ' who will ' change things at @entity47			2
' ' if i get elected i 'd clean house , councillors who 've been there 30 years have got to go			0

i 'm a single mum and i 've worked for everything i have			0
i 'm really that blue - collar , normal , ordinary person , ' she said			0
indeed , after the scandal - ridden tenture of crack - smoking incumbent mayor @entity1 , even the candidacy of such a flamboyant character as @entity93 might seem to @entity2 's voters like a return to relative political normality			1
the mayor has become notorious for his associations with alleged drug dealers , drunken outbursts and unpredictable behaviour - but has consistently dismissed calls for his resignation			0
controversial : mayor @entity1 wades through a media scrum outside @entity47 just yesterday mayor ford fled journalists after @entity2 's police released a detailed description of a video which shows him smoking the highly addictive cocaine derivative			1

after being elected on a right - wing ticket in 2010 , mayor @entity1 has been under great pressure to resign since he admitted smoking crack last year			1
