by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor president @entity2 came out swinging at @entity3 on monday night during a high - dollar fundraiser for the @entity5 in @entity6 , saying their concerns about the 2012 @entity10 terror attack and his @entity12 medical insurance law were ' not serious			1
' his latest antagonistic salvo will enrage the @entity3 , as it brings to mind his july 2013 pronouncement that the fast - brewing controversies engulfing his presidency were ' phony scandals			1
' @entity2 never specific which scandals were ' phony ' during a @entity23 , @entity22 speech about economic issues			1
but at the time a quartet of all - hands - on - deck crises were swirling around the @entity37 : the @entity39 's publicly leaked surveillance programs , the @entity33 's targeting of conservative groups , his @entity26 's seizure of reporters ' phone records and emails , and the @entity10 attack that killed four @entity1			1
on monday , he played to a sympathetic crowd of about 65 people who paid up to $ 32,400 per couple to dine with the president at the home of a wealthy supporter in the tony @entity47 suburb of @entity48 , @entity6			1
the new ' phony scandals ' spin : on monday night @entity2 , shown may 14 making the case for infrastructure spending , called concerns about the 2012 @entity10 terror attack and his @entity12 medical insurance law ' not serious ' ' not serious ' : the @entity1 diplomatic compound in @entity10 , @entity57 erupted in flames on september 11 , 2012 after heavily armed terrorists linked to an @entity61 affiliate group launched mortars and grenades and followed up with small - arms fire pointing a finger at @entity3 , he lobbed rhetorical grenades in the hope of firing up his base for the coming november congressional election			1
' yes , we could reform government and streamline it , and update it so that it is capable to meet the concerns of the 21st century and it can be more customer - friendly , ' he said during a 15 - minute speech			2
' and yes , we do have to worry about issues like long - term debt – although the primary source of long - term debt is health care costs , and if we can help drive those down we ’ll be just fine			2
' ' but that ’s not the debate that ’s taking place right now , ' @entity2 continued , blaming the @entity3 for focusing on his administration 's apparent shortcomings			1
' the debate we ’re having right now is about , what – @entity10 ? @entity12 ? ' an incredulous @entity2 asked , according to a @entity91 transcript			2
' and it becomes this endless loop			0
it 's not speaking to the real concerns that people have			0
' a @entity100 / @entity99 poll published monday indicates that those concerns are split			0
the survey found that the economy is the most often cited national issue that concerns voters the most , with 26 per cent of @entity1 choosing it from a list of 13 hot - button topics			0
but when those who expressed negative opinions about government were asked what brought the worst impact to members of their immediate family , more cited health care and taxes than all other issues combined			0
the @entity100 poll did not include any questions about @entity10			0
' not serious ' : @entity91 press secretary @entity122 has been fending off questions about @entity12 since its disastrous launch in october the poll did show , however , that @entity2 's job - performance approval ratings are significantly under water , making his coattails shorter than ever as november approaches			0
fully 59 per cent of those surveyed said they disapprove of the president 's job performance , including 41 per cent who said they ' strongly disapprove			1
' forty per cent approved of his performance in office , with the ' strongly approve ' option chosen by just 15 per cent			0
@entity2 insisted monday night that while @entity3 – particularly tea party conservatives – are obstructing his agenda , @entity141 are behaving like sober post-partisans			1
' we 've got one party in @entity147 right now that has been captured by ideologues whose core premise is " no , " he said , ' who fundamentally believe that the problem is government ... and whose principal focus at any given point in the day is trying to figure out how can they make people sufficiently cynical , sufficiently angry , sufficiently suspicious that they can win the next election			2
' i hate to be blunt about it , but that ’s the play , ' @entity2 fumed			0
republicans are generally expected to outperform @entity141 in the coming midterms , needing a pickup of six @entity166 seats to control both chambers of @entity147 for the first time since 2006			2
no prognosticator of national significance has predicted that @entity141 can retake the @entity171 , with most citing @entity12 as their main stumbling block .			0

the president spoke to wealthy partisans in one of the *richest* suburbs of @entity47 , *blasting* republicans for not joining with his *priorities*
the @entity3 has been ' captured ' by the tea party , he suggested
the result is a @entity3 that obstructs his agenda with scandals , including the 2012 terror attack in @entity57 and his medical insurance *overhaul* law
the comments bring to mind his 2013 salvo in which he called crisis in the @entity33 , the @entity26 and the @entity196 ' phony scandals '
