early this morning , two high energy proton beams crossed at the @entity1 , breaking the world record for energy in such collisions			1
the 8 tev ( teraelectronvolt ) collisions mark the start of the ' end game ' for the @entity1 's hunt for the @entity8 , the ‘ @entity10 particle ’ that would complete @entity12 's theory of the universe			1
as the @entity1 's crew declared ' stable beams ' it marks the start of a year of experiments that will either find or rule out the existence of the particle			1
the @entity1 is now scheduled to run until the end of 2012 , when it will go into its first long shutdown			0
scientists are confident the @entity24 will be found or ruled out before that point ' the experience of two good years of running at 3.5 tev per beam gave us the confidence to increase the energy for this year without any significant risk to the machine , ' explained @entity33 ’s director for accelerators and technology , @entity35			2
' now it ’s over to the experiments to make the best of the increased discovery potential we ’re delivering them ! ' @entity24 particles , if they exist , will be produced more copiously at 8 tev than at 7 @entity42 - the previous operating power of the machine - but background processes that mimic the @entity24 signal will also increase			2
that means that the full year ’s running will still be necessary to convert the tantalising hints seen in 2011 into a discovery , or to rule out the @entity52 particle altogether			2
' the increase in energy is all about maximising the discovery potential of the @entity1 , ' said @entity33 research director @entity56			0
' and in that respect , 2012 looks set to be a vintage year for particle physics			0
' as the @entity1 's crew declared ' stable beams ' it marks the start of a year of experiments that will either find or rule out the existence of the particle the @entity1 is now scheduled to run until the end of 2012 , when it will go into its first long shutdown in preparation for running at an energy of 6.5 tev per beam as of late 2014 , with the ultimate goal of ramping up to the full design energy of 7 tev			1
' by the time the @entity1 goes into its first long stop at the end of this year , we will either know that a @entity24 particle exists or have ruled out the existence of a @entity24 , ' said @entity33 ’s @entity56 , @entity56 in an earlier interview			0
' @entity79 would be a major advance in our exploration of nature , bringing us closer to understanding how the fundamental particles acquire their mass , and marking the beginning of a new chapter in particle physics			0
