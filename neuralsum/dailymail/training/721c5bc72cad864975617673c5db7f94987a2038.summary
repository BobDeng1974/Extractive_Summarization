by @entity0 published : 06:22 est , 19 march 2014 updated : 07:51 est , 19 march 2014 a motorist has branded council jobsworths ' pathetic ' after he was given a parking ticket for briefly pulling over to check a road 's parking restrictions			1
@entity7 , 68 , stopped outside a bar he was visiting in @entity9 and got out of the driver 's seat to read a parking sign on the pavement			1
when he realised it was a clearway for another 90 minutes he jumped back into his car and parked around the corner			0
@entity7 was sent this parking fine picture by @entity20 showing him looking at a sign about parking restrictions @entity7 outside the @entity24 pub in @entity25 , @entity9 , where he was fined but his momentary infringement was caught on film by a @entity29 operator at @entity20 and he was sent a £ 70 penalty notice			1
mr @entity7 , from the city , said : ' i ’ll be honest , when i first opened the letter i had to really think back as i could n’t even remember the incident			2
' i could n’t have been parked up for more than 90 seconds , tops			0
' i literally got out of the car , looked up at the sign and saw i could n’t park there during peak hours , so i got back in and drove away			0
' the letter included pictures of mr @entity7 , snapped by the council ’s cameras , which clearly showed him out of his car , leaning back to check the signs			1
' it ’s pathetic , and a complete waste of the council ’s money , ' he added			0
mr @entity7 pulled up for a minute to check the hours of parking restrictions - only to receive a £ 70 fine in the post almost four weeks later the parking restrictions sign in @entity52 fell foul of ' it has to pay to send the notice and pictures out and then for the appeal process , all for the sake of a few seconds			1
' mr @entity7 had taken his partner out for a romantic @entity61 drink at a pub in @entity25 , @entity9 , when he thought he had found the perfect spot to park outside			1
but after hopping out at 5.01pm to check the parking sign he saw there was a restriction between 4.30pm and 6.30pm , so he drove off to park his @entity67 nearby			2
he thought nothing more of it until the parking fine dropped on his doormat demanding he paid the full amount within 28 days			2
the letter mr @entity7 received included pictures the council 's cameras had taken of him reading the sign about parking restrictions mr @entity7 , who works as a builder and decorator , said : ' i now have to spend my time sorting this all out			1
why should anyone have to go through that ? ' he added : ' i understand parking tickets are necessary and if i ’d parked without paying then i would n’t have a problem			0
' but how do the council expect you to know you ca n’t park there if the signs are n’t clearly visible from inside the car ? ' @entity20 has now said it has re-considered the case and would be withdrawing the fine			0
a council spokeswoman said : ' the case has been reviewed and we will be withdrawing the penalty charge notice issued to mr @entity7			2
' he was clearly reading the restriction signs and not parking			0
we would like to remind drivers who think they have received a parking fine incorrectly to use the appeals procedure that is set out on the ticket			0

@entity7 , 68 , stopped in a space for a matter of seconds
he got out of the driver 's seat to check the parking sign
but his momentary infringement was *captured* on cctv
@entity9 council sent him a fine and pictures of the incident
but it now accepts mr @entity7 was *n't* parking and has withdrawn the fine
