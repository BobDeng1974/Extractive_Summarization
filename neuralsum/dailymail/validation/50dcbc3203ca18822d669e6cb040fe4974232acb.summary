i ca n’t wait to compete at the @entity1 in @entity2 , which is the biggest competition of the season so far			1
for multi-eventers , packing your suitcase to go abroad can be a bit of an ordeal			1
i noticed it more last year when i just did long jump at the @entity12 and i only had to take one pair of trainers			1
with pentathlon i ’ve got five different pairs of spikes for the hurdles , high jump , shot putt , long jump and 800m			2
all kinds of things come with being a multi-eventer and making sure you have room in your case is just one of them			2
it was easy for this weekend because i ’m not away for long so will pretty much live in my @entity32 kit and a couple of pairs of jeans			2
@entity37 's @entity36 spoke about her preparations for the @entity1 the 22 - year - old athlete will be competing in the pentathlon in this year 's indoor championships in @entity2 normally at @entity43 room with @entity44 or @entity45 but neither of them are competing in the indoors this season so i do n’t know who i ’ll be in a room with this time – you get the chance to pick but i just left the box empty			1
sprinters normally have their events in the afternoon so they can stay up later and sleep in whereas i ’m always on first thing so it ’s more about trying to find someone that matches your timetable than your personality			2
i ’m just competing for the one day on friday so i ’ll have the rest of the weekend just to relax and be a spectator so it will definitely be good to do that			2
as well as being supported by the @entity68 i am supported by the philanthropist @entity69 , who also sponsors @entity70 so i ’ll be with him in the crowd cheering her on and holding a banner for the 800m final on sunday			0
if i ’m rooting for any athlete other than myself it ’s going to be @entity70 because she ’s had such a tough past			0
she ’s been so unlucky not just with injuries but competing with lots of drugs cheats in her event			1
i ’m glad athletics is being cleaned up because to have an equal playing field means so much to us as athletes			1
you dedicate your life to it and it ’s so upsetting to think someone might be getting an unfair advantage and there ’s literally nothing you can do about it			0
it ’s definitely good that all the drugs cheats are getting exposed and it ’s going to be a clean sport			1
i ’ve got personal bests in the long jump and high jump already this season			0
the last time i did pentathlon was 2012 because i did n’t do an indoor season in 2013 and last year i was ill. i was a little kiddy in 2012 so i definitely should be getting one this time			1
the @entity106 is confident after recording personal bests in the long jump and high jump this season i feel like a different person since i had a foot injury , which ruled me out of the @entity111 and @entity112 last year			1
i ca n’t really pinpoint what has changed i just enjoy being out there and i ’m not nervous to compete any more			0
sometimes before the injury i used to think : “ i just want to be a normal teenager or young person ” but i realised it was this that i love and enjoy			0
it made me realise what i will be missing out on			0
i ’ve been focussing so much on the indoors that i have n’t had chance to do a lot of javelin training which is one of my weakest events			0
i ’m really looking forward to my next session with the @entity37 number one @entity130 , who is helping me work on my technique , in april			0
away from competition , there ’s been a new addition to my household - i ’ve got another sausage dog as a companion to @entity139			1
i ’ve called him @entity141			0
i wanted to call him @entity142 to stick with the sausage themed names but my boyfriend said it was too posh and i was trying to push the sausage names too much ! he ’s well trained though , much better than @entity139			0
i think it ’s like having children - you make more mistakes with the first one and then correct them with the second ! as well as funding the @entity156 athletes , every week @entity68 players raise over £ 33 million for arts , heritage , charity , community projects and grass roots sports clubs and facilities			1
