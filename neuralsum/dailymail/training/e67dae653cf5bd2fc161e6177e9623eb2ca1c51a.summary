@entity0 need to stop trying to play like @entity1 and return to what they had under @entity4 , according to @entity6 pundit @entity5			1
the @entity8 's defensive frailties were once again exposed during their 3 - 2 defeat by @entity10 on sunday - meaning only @entity12 have conceded more goals than @entity15 's side this season			1
speaking after the game , @entity5 said : ' @entity0 are flattering to deceive at the moment			2
@entity15 needs to change his style to arrest @entity0 's slump , says @entity5 the @entity6 presenter claims @entity0 need to get back to playing @entity4 ' direct style of football ' the second goal typifies @entity0 at the moment , they are trying to play their way out of trouble when there 's nothing wrong with putting your foot through it occasionally			1
' they 're trying to basically play like @entity1 at their best , but there 's very few teams out there that can keep the ball when teams come after them big style			2
' it 's not all pass - pass - pass , sometime you have to mix it up at times			2
' the former @entity47 midfielder even went as far as to say that @entity15 should consider sacrificing his expansive style in favour of the more direct approach that identified the club under previous manager @entity4			1
' you have to get back to what @entity4 had			0
they were a little bit more in your face , more direct and they mixed it up a little bit			0
' now , they are so predictable to play against and that 's why they 're conceding so many goals as well			0
' @entity63 celebrates scoring to level @entity65 's opening goal at @entity66 @entity67 ( centre ) adopts an @entity70 goal celebration after giving @entity10 a first half lead @entity72 ( left ) watches the ball cross @entity75 goalline for what was eventually the winner fellow pundit @entity78 agreed that @entity15 's philosophy of playing the ball out from the back is contributing to their woeful defensive record this season			2
' @entity0 were beaten in every single department and the goals that they conceded were a result of play that @entity15 tries to promote			1
' obviously playing out from the back , which is fine - but they have overplayed and it has cost them			0
' but if that is the way that you promote to play then you have to lie and die by that			0
@entity94 ( left ) consoles @entity15 , but the @entity96 manager insists he wo n't change his philosophy however , the @entity96 manager was defiant that he would persevere with the same tactics that led @entity0 to a praiseworthy fifth placed finish last season			1

we showed last season what we could do , we have n't lost that talent , if anything we 've increased it			0
