when the @entity2 warrior buried his hoard of silver coins and jewellery in a lead container , he doubtless expected to be back for them after his next battle			1
but thanks to those pesky @entity11 , they remained undisturbed for more than 1,000 years ... until @entity12 discovered them with a metal detector during his lunch break			1
found just 18 inches beneath the surface of a field in @entity18 , @entity19 , the 201 objects were yesterday hailed by the @entity21 as one of the most important @entity2 discoveries of recent times			1
artefacts : @entity12 holds a @entity2 arm ring which was part of a hoard of the @entity2 treasure he found in @entity18 @entity12 's hoard : a viking coin depicting the name @entity32 , which has been attributed to the nephew of @entity34 based on previous finds , they could be worth as much as £ 500,000			1
mr @entity12 , a 39 - year - old stonemason , said he found the hoard in september			1
‘ when i lifted the lead pot out of the ground there was a hole underneath and silver started to fall out			0
that is when i realised i had found something important			2
’ quite how important became apparent when one of the 27 coins in the hoard proved to be a previously unrecorded type which the experts believe carries the name of an unknown @entity2 ruler in northern @entity53			1
the name is @entity55 , thought to be an attempt to represent the @entity58 name @entity59			2
valuable : mr @entity12 holds a @entity2 arm ring the coin also helps to dispel the popularly held view that @entity63 were all pagans who pillaged monasteries out of hatred of the @entity67			1
great : a statue of @entity34 in @entity69 one side has the words ‘ @entity73 [ short for @entity72 ’ , which means ‘ the @entity74 and @entity34 ’ , and they are arranged in the form of a cross , reflecting the fact that many @entity63 converted to @entity78 soon after settling in @entity79			0
viking raids on @entity79 began in @entity81			0
then in 865ad a full @entity2 army stormed through the country			1
at the time the items were buried around @entity85 , the @entity63 were fighting the @entity11 to keep control of the @entity87 – and presumably their owner came off second best			2
the museum ’s curator of early medieval coins , dr @entity89 , estimated the total value of the items at the time of burial would have been enough to buy ‘ a small estate , a large flock of sheep or a small herd of cattle ’			2
the haul , which has yet to be valued , went on display at the museum yesterday and will be examined by a coroner tomorrow			0
if an inquest declares that it is treasure , it will be offered to the @entity21 or a local museum which has it valued by an independent board of experts			0
if the museum wants the find , it must pay the market value of the treasure to the finder and / or landowner			0
if it does not , the finder can keep it			0
in this case , the @entity117 is interested in buying the find for its collection			0
the proceeds are expected to be divided between mr @entity12 and the owner of the land .			0

the 1,100 - year - old find *includes* a coin thought to refer to a previously unknown @entity2 ruler in northern @entity53
there are more than *200* items in the hoard , found by a metal detector
