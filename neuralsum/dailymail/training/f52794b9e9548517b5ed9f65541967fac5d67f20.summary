by @entity0 researchers have solved the mystery of how massive lakes in the @entity4 were formed			2
lakes were able to grow large – rivaling the @entity6 – during the peak of the last @entity8 21,000 years ago , a period known as the ' @entity10 , ' the key , researchers discovered , was that evaporation rates were significantly lower than today			1
during the @entity10 , large lakes ( light blue ) covered many of the now dry desert basins of @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			2
at the height of the @entity10 , @entity21 had a surface area of about 390 square miles , roughly the size of @entity25			1
during the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) , giant lakes covered large sections of @entity20 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity28 , including where @entity29 is today			1
scientists have long been puzzled by how these ancient lakes , now completely dry , grew so large			0
the prevailing theory was there was more rain and snowfall during this time period			0
but recent evidence from paleoecology and climate model simulations indicates that precipitation rates were actually relatively low compared to later periods			0
' it was previously thought that the lakes grew because there was more rain and snowfall during this period of the @entity49 's history , ' said @entity50 , a graduate student in @entity52 's @entity51 and the first author of the study			0

to resolve the discrepancy between computer models and the interpretation of geologic evidence , @entity50 collected more than 80 samples of tufa – a limestone created by the evaporation of mineralized water – from different locations around the edges of @entity21 , a moderate - sized fossil lake in @entity75 , @entity20			1
the layered shorelines of @entity20 's @entity21 date back to the peak of the last @entity8 and provide a record of lake level changes over thousands of years			1

their findings showed that at the height of the @entity10 , @entity21 had a surface area of about 390 square miles , roughly the size of @entity25			1
their analyses revealed that 21,000 years ago , the evaporation rate at @entity21 was nearly 40 percent lower than today , with precipitation rates similar to the modern era			1
more quantitative studies of past climate could help refine the computer models used by the @entity96 ( @entity96 ) to simulate @entity49 's atmospheric conditions under changing atmospheric conditions , said @entity99 , assistant professor of geological and environmental sciences , who headed the project			0
' the @entity96 uses climate models to simulate past and future climate , so knowing that some of the models do a better job of simulating past changes gives us more confidence that we understand the physics involved , ' @entity103 said			0
' that can give us more confidence in the models we use to simulate future climate change			2
