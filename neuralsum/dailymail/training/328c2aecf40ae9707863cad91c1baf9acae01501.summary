by @entity0 the @entity1 , played by @entity2 in @entity3 , pictured , is often considered cool a panel of experts recently voted @entity6 the coolest brand in the @entity8 – but what makes a company cool ? recent findings from @entity13 researchers suggest that coolness goes hand - in - hand with autonomy ; breaking the rules and going against the social norm			1
but they claim that rule breaking and being different is only tolerated by consumers , when it is done for positive or worthy reasons			1
' the marketplace values cool brands , ' said authors @entity25 from @entity27 , and @entity28 from the @entity29			0
' a cool image helped solidify @entity32 ’s status as an iconic brand , rejuvenate sales of @entity35 , and vault @entity6 into the ranking of ‘ the best global brand ’ of 2013			2
‘ @entity38 excites consumers , adds symbolic currency to products , and drives consumer trends - everyone wants it , even if they ca n’t define what ‘ cool ’ actually is			2
although researchers do not agree on a specific definition , previous studies have found four defining properties			0
the first , according to the recent study , is that coolness is socially constructed and is not an inherent feature of an object or person - meaning objects and people are cool only to the extent that others consider them to be			0

but they claim rule breaking is only tolerated by brands when it is done for positive reasons participants were shown a variety of water bottle shapes , pictured , that had the logos and branding removed , and were asked to rate each one in terms of coolness			1
the researchers found a direct link between the bottles that were described as ' weird ' and ' unique ' and high cool ratings secondly , coolness is subjective and dynamic , and changes over time , and thirdly , coolness is perceived to be a positive quality			1
finally , the researchers concluded that coolness requires more than the mere perception that something is positive or desirable			2

in conclusion , researchers said ' coolness is a subjective , positive trait perceived in people , brands , products , and trends that are autonomous in an appropriate way			1

in the first study , participants were shown a variety of different water bottle shapes that had the logos and branding removed			0
they were asked to rate each one in terms of coolness , and then asked why they thought they were cool			0
the researchers found a direct link between the bottles that were described as ‘ weird ’ and ‘ unique ’ , and high cool ratings			1
this proved autonomy was a factor when defining coolness			0
in a follow up study , they asked participants to rate an advert for a brand that promoted either breaking or following a dress code			1
@entity144 were told that the dress code existed as a way to honour war veterans , while group b were told it existed to honour a corrupt dictator			0
results discovered that breaking the dress code made the brand seem cooler , but only when the dress code was for a necessary , positive and worthy reason			2
‘ collectively , our studies find that coolness is a subjective , positive trait perceived in people , brands , products , and trends that are autonomous in an appropriate way , ’ the researchers concluded in the @entity156 .			1

researchers from @entity13 wanted to determine what makes a brand cool
they discovered brands become cool when they ‘ break the rules ’
but this only *applies* if the rule breaking is for a worthy or positive cause
to test the theory , participants were asked to rate the shape of bottles
bottles *dubbed* ‘ unique ’ were *deemed* cooler than *standard* bottles
participants were then asked to rate an advert based on how cool it was
@entity190 concluded that coolness is a subjective , positive trait perceived in brands and products that are ' autonomous in an appropriate way '
