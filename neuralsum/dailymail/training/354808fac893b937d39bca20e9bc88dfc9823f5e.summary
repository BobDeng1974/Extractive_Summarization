flirting with cabin crew is one way of passing the time on board a flight - but research has revealed it 's often in vain as only 6 per cent of cases develop into something more meaningful			1
surprisingly only 14 per cent of @entity9 who have been on a plane in the past two years have attempted to flirt with a member of the cabin crew			1
while 37 per cent of these felt that the cabin crew member flirted back with them , 11 per cent said they were ignored by the person for the remainder of the flight and only six per cent said it actually went somewhere after the journey			1
according to a survey , 14 per cent of @entity21 have admitted to flirting with cabin crew on board their flight of the 14 per cent of @entity9 who admit to flirting , 37 per cent said they received the same back @entity28 conducted the research as part of an ongoing study into the way airline passengers keep themselves entertained and interact with fellow passengers during a flight			1
a total of 2,749 respondents from the @entity9 , all of whom were aged 18 and over and stated that they 'd been on a flight in the last two years , were quizzed about their flying experiences			0
when the 14 per cent of ' flirters ' were asked why they did this , they stated that they had ' found them attractive ' ( 37 per cent ) , ' heard stories about flight attendants ' ( 21 per cent ) and ' i was dared to ' ( 18 per cent )			2
only 6 per cent of those who had flirted with a member of the cabin crew admitted that their efforts had lead to the pair swapping contact details and meeting at a later date			1
listen to music – 73 per cent 2			2
talk to fellow passengers – 68 per cent 3			2
watch in - flight movies – 56 per cent 4			2
sleep – 49 per cent 5			0
read a magazine / book – 35 per cent 6			0
flirting with cabin crew – 14 per cent those who had admitted to flirting with flight attendants were also asked how the cabin crew member had responded at the time , with 37 per cent of them stating the person had flirted back , while 23 per cent admitted they 'd looked a bit taken aback and 11 per cent said the flight attendant had tried to avoid them for the remainder of the flight			1
men were twice as likely as women to flirt with cabin crew staff , according to the findings			0
in order to determine if this was purely a @entity9 trend or something that was becoming popular with all those around @entity83 , 1,000 people from @entity83 countries outside of the @entity9 were polled			0
when asked ' have you flirted with a member of the cabin crew on a flight before ? ' 36 per cent of respondents from @entity94 said ' yes ' , with a further 22 per cent from @entity95 , 15 per cent from @entity96 and only seven per cent from @entity97 saying the same			1
@entity94 topped the polls for the greatest number of people admitting to flirting on planes furthermore , only 13 per cent of those from @entity94 and four per cent from @entity96 admitted that the flirtatious behaviour had carried on past the flight			1
@entity104 , co-founder of @entity28 , said : ' hooking up with a flight attendant seems to be a bit of a fantasy for many @entity9 ; it makes you wonder if this is because of how they 're portrayed in the movies			0
' either way , it 's not particularly nice for the cabin crew team when it happens , and it must happen to them on such a regular basis they see it coming before you even get chance to speak to them			0
' if you think about it , it 's not the wisest idea either because you 're then trapped on a plane with them for a few hours , so if it goes horribly wrong or you do n't get the reaction you expected , you 're stuck in a confined space with them until the flight lands			0
