by @entity0 published : 19:05 est , 28 april 2013 updated : 19:38 est , 28 april 2013 pledge : business minster @entity1 said the share handout will be ¿ as attractive as possible ¿ every postal worker in @entity5 will be given around £ 1,500 of shares in @entity7 when it floats on the stock market , the business minister will say today			0
it will be the largest employee share scheme for 25 years with around 140,000 workers from postmen to local delivery office managers expected to scoop a windfall			1
in his first speech on the controversial privatisation of the country ’s postal service , @entity1 will today pledge to make the share handout ‘ as attractive as possible			2
’ he is keen the share handout is structured in a way that all postal workers benefit , rather than just allowing the executives to walk away with millions			0
but he will warn the militant postal union , the @entity24 , that they must ‘ engage ’ with the government - or the deal could be scuppered			1
the @entity24 is bitterly opposed to the privatisation of @entity7 , a deal which it fears will lead to price rises , pay cuts and the destruction of the service			1
in a protest against the privatisation plans , the union is currently plotting to boycott the handling of any mail which has not been sent through @entity7 , but one of its rivals , such as @entity39			0
speaking at think - tank @entity40 today , mr @entity1 will call on the @entity24 to ‘ put ideology aside ’ so that their members ‘ do not lose out			1
’ he will say : ‘ i am determined to do the right deal for them			0
‘ @entity7 employees spend their working lives making the post run on time , delivering to far flung parts of the country from @entity52 to @entity53			0
they are absolutely central to the future success of the company			2
’ under the proposals , the government has promised to give ten per cent of the company to its workers when it is privatised			1
a stock market flotation is mr @entity1 ’s preferred option , and a deal valuing the company at between £ 2billion and £ 3billion is expected to take place before april 2014			2
workers ' windfall : the @entity24 are opposed to the whole privitisation but mr @entity1 has told the union it must engage with the deal but a major sticking point for the union surrounds whether the shares are given to postmen for free , or are sold at a discounted price			1
in today ’s speech , mr @entity1 is not expected to make clear which option is on the table			0
they should also get extra cash from the shares , known as a dividend , every six months			0
he will say : ‘ people should be in no doubt , whether the shares are discounted , or free , it is a hugely significant commitment from the government to @entity7 ’s workers			2
’ @entity24 bosses have already made clear their trenchant opposition to a deal which would require postmen to pay even a penny for the shares			1
@entity94 , general secretary of the @entity24 , said : ‘ the idea that postal workers are going to sell their soul for a ten per cent stake in the company is not going to work			1
@entity24 trouble : @entity101 the general secretary of the @entity103 has warned that privatising the @entity7 would be a ' disaster ' ‘ even less so if the government expects postal workers to put up their own cash in order to buy shares			1
‘ postal workers know that privatisation would mean the break - up of the company , more job losses , worse terms and conditions and attacks on their pensions			1
‘ it would be a wrecking ball to the industry they work in			0
why would they sign up to that for a one - off share - scheme when their pay , conditions and job security for their rest of their career could be badly affected by the consequences ? ’ anybody from families to pensioners will be allowed to subscribe for shares in the @entity7 flotation			0
it is too early to say how much they will cost or how many shares people will be able to buy in the company which has throughout its history had just one shareholder - the government			2
@entity7 has been gearing up for privatisation for months , a deal which @entity145 refused to do saying she was ‘ not prepared to have the @entity147 ’s head privatised			0
’ its £ 12billion pension black hole has been dumped on the taxpayer , and a first - class stamp has jumped from 46p to 60p after the regulator scrapped the limited on how much it can be increased each year .			0
