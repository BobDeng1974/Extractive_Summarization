@entity9 captured the moment on her mobile phone and uploaded the five - second clip to @entity13			1
she said it has since received hundreds of comments from outraged viewers			1
@entity37 said she initially thought it was ' quite amusing ' to see a cat being walked on a lead but tried to intervene when she realised the animal was ' being dragged '			2
the 26 - year - old said the owner ignored her and continued pulling the animal ' for a good five minutes ' before picking up the cat			1
she said : ' she caught me filming her but then she dragged the cat down the road anyway			0
' i said to her that she might want to pick the cat up but she ignored me and kept going			0
' it was only a little black and white kitten			2
at first i thought it was funny but the more i look at it i just think she was horrible			0
' the woman noticed she was being filmed but continued to drag the cat behind her , @entity37 said @entity57 , a companion animal scientist from the @entity28 , said the five - second video shows the animal was distressed			1
she said : ' we have concerns about the handling of the cat in this footage as it appears to be causing it distress			2
' the cat does look like it 's kind of being dragged and looks distressed , putting its front paws out like it wants to stop			0
' without seeing more it 's hard to know how comfortable the cat is walking on a lead but it gives the impression that the cat was not particularly comfortable or relaxed			0
' she added that putting cats on leads took away their ' sense of control ' and that harnesses should be introduced gradually from a young age if owners want to put them on a lead .			0
