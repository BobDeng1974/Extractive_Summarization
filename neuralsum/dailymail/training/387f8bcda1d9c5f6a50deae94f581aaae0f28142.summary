by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 09:48 est , 17 july 2013 updated : 13:38 est , 17 july 2013 @entity2 was today forced to defend another u-turn as the government ditched plans for minimum alcohol pricing			1
the prime minister had championed the idea of setting unit price to curb cheap booze deals but faced a @entity12 revolt , with senior ministers warning it would hit the poorest people hardest			1
multi-buy offers will also not be banned but there will be a ban on the sale of alcoholic drinks priced below the level of duty and vat , to the fury of some mps			1
@entity2 defended the latest government u-turn as he welcomed @entity29 prime minister @entity28 to @entity30 for talks it is the latest in a string of policy reversal 's ordered by mr @entity2 since he became prime minister			1
the @entity35 carried out a consultation on a 45p minimum unit price earlier this year			1
it would mean a can of strong lager could not be sold for less than £ 1.56 and a bottle of wine for less than £ 4.22			0
the list of government u-turns now runs to more than 40 since the coalition was formed in may 2010			0
in the early days ministers tried to argue that it was a sign of strength to admit when they got things wrong			2
but strategists feared too many reversals risked looking weak			0
major policies floated and then ditched by @entity2 include : but today home office minister @entity53 said there was not enough ‘ concrete evidence ’ that the move would reduce the level of problem drinking without hitting people who drink responsibly			1
mr @entity53 also ruled out a ban on multi-buy promotions due to a ‘ lack of convincing evidence ’ that it would have a significant effect on consumption			0
the main change which will go ahead will see a ban on selling alcohol below the value of alcohol duty and vat			1
it will come into effect in @entity74 and @entity75 by spring 2014 and will mean ordinary strength lager will not be sold for less than around 40p			0
however , @entity77 @entity25 condemned the decision			2
@entity80 @entity79 said the decision left the @entity82 ‘ dangerously lagging behind ’ other countries when it came to public health			0
mr @entity2 defended the u-turn , coming days after the government also dropped plans to force tobacco firms to sell cigarettes in plain packaging			2
speaking in @entity91 the prime minister said : ‘ we are introducing today what is effectively a minimum price because we are saying it 's going to be illegal to sell alcohol below the rate of duty plus vat			1
‘ so supermarkets or shops deeply discounting alcohol will be made illegal			0
that , i think , will be a positive step forward			0
’ curbs : minimum alcohol pricing has been dropped but retailers will be banned from selling booze below the cost of duty and vat mr @entity2 added that there were arguments with ‘ a lot of merit ’ in favour of a minimum price but there were also problems			1
‘ there 's a degree of legal uncertainty - it 's been introduced in @entity121 but it 's still under legal challenge - and there 's also question marks about the evidence behind it and how well it can work			0
‘ so , when we have more evidence about how it can work and when we 've got more certainty about the legal issues i think it 's an idea that has merit , that i 'll be happy to consider again			0
’ he stressed that the decision had been made ‘ by me as prime minister ’ , as had the shelving of plans for cigarettes in plain packaging			1
it follows claims by @entity142 that new @entity77 election guru @entity143 , a lobbyist who counts tobacco giant @entity144 as a client , had influenced the public health policy u-turns			2
backlash : @entity77 mp @entity150 , a former gp , said doctors wanted to see minimum pricing introduced while @entity79 ( right ) warned the u-turn would cost lives but mr @entity2 said : ‘ in the end the buck stops absolutely here			1
these are both decisions that i have made , i think they are the right ones because we need the evidence base , we need the legal certainty and then we can move ahead			0
‘ but until then it makes sense not to move ahead			0
’ however in the @entity165 lined up to criticise the decision to abandon minimum alcohol pricing			2
miss @entity79 told mr @entity53 : ' scientific studies show a clear positive impact between introducing minimum pricing and alcohol - related deaths			2
' does this not show that the decision to delay minimum alcohol pricing today leaves us dangerously lagging behind in terms of public health policy , which will ultimately cost lives ? ' dr @entity150 , a former gp , said : ' doctors up and down this country who are fed up with being lectured on how to reduce avoidable mortality within the @entity181 see the one tool they are asking for that could reduce avoidable mortality in liver disease taken away			1
' @entity77 mp @entity186 was also angry at the decision to drop the policy			2
he said supermarkets would still be able to undercut pubs which served reputable customers .			0

prime minister had championed setting minimum unit cost price
but he faced a @entity12 revolt from senior ministers opposed to the plan
instead selling alcohol priced below the level of duty and vat will be axed
@entity77 mps warn u-turn on *tackling* problem drinking will cost lives
