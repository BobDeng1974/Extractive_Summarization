struggling under the weight of packed bags from luxury stores including @entity4 and @entity5 , @entity0 pauses for breath			1
the glittering mall is doing a brisk trade , with queues thronging the popular shops and the most sought - after fashion items selling out fast			0
giggling , @entity0 inspects her purchases , including a £ 1,010 bubblegum - pink @entity14 cashmere sweater , a black @entity17 cocktail purse costing £ 430 , a £ 335 @entity5 shawl and a @entity4 robot key - chain costing a mere £ 115			1
after flying to @entity21 from @entity22 for a few days , the 25 - year - old has n’t tagged on the lavish shopping spree as a holiday treat			1
this was why she came			0
this year is @entity21 ’s busiest @entity35 ever , with more than 200,000 @entity33 estimated to visit , bringing a welcome boost of around half a billion pounds to our economy			1
some might think @entity0 ’s haul from the @entity30 shopping centre in @entity21 is a tasteless display of extravagance			1
but she ’s keen to point out she ’s sleeping on a friend ’s sofa to save cash for shopping — and she ’s visited @entity51 chain stores , too			2
@entity0 , 25 , loves @entity4 and @entity5 the marketing student says : ‘ once a year there is nothing like a big mall experience to get all the luxury brands under one roof and go on a spree , ’ she beams , proudly holding up her shopping bags like trophies			1
‘ it ’s like being @entity62 in @entity63			1
‘ the brands my friends and i really love are @entity4 and @entity5			1
but we all love the @entity34 @entity51 , too , especially @entity67			2
’ this year , the @entity33 celebrates its 65th anniversary , during which the whole nation gets three days paid holiday for @entity35			1
its government started the tradition in 1999 to boost domestic tourism , but since then it has become the fashion for the wealthier inhabitants to fly abroad			0
@entity37 ’s economy has been booming in recent years			1
its purchasing power is set to exceed that of the @entity80 this year , and is on track to become the number one global economy by the early 2020s			2
in short , it has produced some seriously wealthy young things , eager to spend their cash			0
@entity87 has set up a @entity88 to train businesses on how to encourage @entity33 visitors , with the aim of trebling numbers here by 2020			2
last month , chancellor @entity93 announced the @entity34 would fund 25,000 tourist visas every year to boost numbers further still			1
@entity96 , director of marketing in the @entity34 and @entity97 for @entity30 , says that even before that announcement , @entity37 had become ‘ the number one international market to visit @entity100 , particularly @entity101 — the luxury area of the mall			1
‘ three years ago , it became evident that the @entity33 market was rapidly becoming one of the strongest emerging markets , and it was at this point that @entity30 introduced @entity109 and @entity111 - speaking concierges and translated the mall guides			1
’ @entity37 has become ‘ the number one international market to visit @entity100 , particularly @entity101 — the luxury area of the mall , ' according to its director or marketing @entity96 @entity35 shopping in @entity21 this year is predicted to surge by 20 per cent			1
unlike @entity118 shoppers — who make a similar annual splurge in the capital in the summer , nicknamed the @entity121 — the @entity33 do n’t usually drive around in flash cars making outrageous displays of wealth			2
instead , they ’ll take public transport , or — in the case of those descending on @entity129 , the discount luxury retailer in @entity131 — go by coach			0
but like the @entity118 tourists , they do spend unbelievable amounts of money			0
@entity35 is in full swing at @entity138 , where student @entity139 has just bought five handbags — one @entity4 , two @entity141 and two @entity5 — costing a total of £ 7,000			1
chancellor @entity93 announced the @entity34 would fund 25,000 tourist visas every year to boost numbers further the @entity141 concession appears especially popular			1
‘ i ’ll hold it for you if you like , ’ says one canny assistant to a @entity33 woman inspecting a £ 1,300 mac , adding , ‘ but your size is going very quickly			1
’ it ’s little wonder retailers refer to this @entity33 custom as ‘ @entity156 ’			1
@entity30 ’s cantonese - speaking concierge service is designed to cater to the every whim of its wealthy visitors			0
the concierge confirms the @entity33 are distinct from other nations , with their own cultural mores : ‘ they are very organised and plan their trip day by day , hour by hour			1
they have done their research , and brand-wise they know what ’s on - trend			0
‘ the @entity33 do n’t want to draw attention to themselves , they are just here for the @entity173 experience			1
they do n’t need to be patronised			0
the idea they want lots of bowing is a myth			0
‘ we have hands - free shopping , where bags are discreetly taken away and delivered to hotels			2
but the @entity33 do n’t avail themselves of that service			2
’ @entity27 and @entity28 from @entity22 have spent two hours in the @entity5 store in @entity30 ’s luxury village area , examining every bag they could lay their hands on			1
they have bought two — a clutch and a wallet — and spent more than £ 3,000			0
they ’re off to @entity17 next			0
the @entity33 seem to love the convenience of everything under one roof			2
@entity194 and @entity195 , from @entity196 , have bought shirts in upmarket @entity198 and @entity199			0
they ’re just getting started			0
student @entity200 , 23 , dressed casually in a lumberjack shirt and surrounded by bouncy female friends , takes more than an hour in exclusive jeweller @entity203 , choosing a diamond ring for his girlfriend back home			0
going on a shopping spree is ‘ like being @entity62 in @entity63 , ' says student @entity0 as his friends tease him about the purchase , he walks away crimson - faced with embarrassment , with the light blue bag in one hand and a carton of juice in the other			1
@entity30 is n’t the only emporium cashing in			0
at top @entity109 restaurant @entity220 , just off @entity221 , there is a special @entity35 menu , with all the prices ending in eight — an auspicious number in @entity37			1
meanwhile , entire four - star hotels , such as the 300 - room @entity227 in @entity229 ’s @entity228 and the 400 - room @entity230 in @entity231 , have been taken over by @entity33 tour operators			1
@entity233 is a must - see destination for @entity33 visitors , who can converse easily with the @entity238 - speaking staff			2
@entity242 , 23 , is buying a @entity244 handbag for his girlfriend , after discussing the purchase in his native tongue , @entity239 opts for the £ 3,000 black one rather than the yellow quilted version costing £ 2,990			0
@entity233 , like many luxury stores , now takes the cup or @entity249 card , which allows @entity33 customers to see and complete the transaction in their own currency			2
the visitors can also claim back vat by filling in a form in - store			0
they then get 20 per cent of the price refunded to their card straight away			0
smiling , @entity239 says : ‘ it ’s much cheaper here			2
luxury goods are all more expensive in @entity37			2
a @entity262 , for example is three times the price			0
’ @entity264 , 19 , a student from @entity196 , has bought two @entity203 rings for his girlfriend			0
his friend @entity266 blithely explains why the young people of @entity37 can buy things beyond the reach of their @entity34 contemporaries			1
‘ the academic level in @entity37 is high , and people work very hard , so they earn a lot of money now , ’ he says			1
the @entity33 target a few brands — big global names such as @entity5 , @entity277 or @entity4 , or @entity34 ‘ heritage ’ makes such as @entity141 , @entity279 or @entity280			1
@entity281 ( left ) , and @entity282 ( right ) from @entity283 , @entity37 , shopping at @entity30 , @entity228 , @entity21 originality is not the point			1
there is a group mentality , and buying something one ’s peers did n’t recognise would be peculiar			0
so back at @entity138 the @entity244 concession is fit to burst , while younger , more obscure designers whom @entity34 shoppers are so proud of ‘ discovering ’ get ignored			1
coming out of the @entity296 concession , i meet two students who have rushed straight from the airport , complete with their suitcases , so they would n’t miss a minute ’s shopping			0
@entity301 , 22 , has already bought a bag in @entity5 , underwear in @entity304 and a necklace in @entity203			0
that ’s more than £ 2,000 in 40 minutes — and she has barely made a dent on her shopping list			0
all over the store , there are eager @entity33 spenders on the phone — calling home to refine an order from friends and family — or discussing goods quietly with each other			0
these eager shoppers touch everything			0
in @entity138 ’ watch department , one @entity33 man is mulling over a £ 60,000 black number by @entity324 while another girl tries to choose between a white - strapped @entity326 and an @entity327 , both more than £ 10,000			1
upstairs in luxury concession @entity330 , a @entity33 woman is testing all the security - tagged bags for weight and examining them in every way			2
nearby , every single person in @entity330 and @entity4 is @entity33			1
in the @entity141 children ’s shop , three female students excitedly discover they can fit into the bigger children ’s sizes			0
@entity341 , 30 , a company director from @entity22 , is on a one - week shopping trip with his girlfriend @entity344 with an enviable budget of £ 10,000			0
‘ we ’ll go to @entity347 and maybe @entity129 , ’ he says			0
‘ i ’ll buy suits and maybe watches for my parents			0
’ @entity350 , 25 from @entity351 in @entity37 , has spent £ 1,350 on a @entity4 handbag			1
she says : ‘ this is a new design you ca n’t find in @entity37			2
i ’m so happy with it			0
’ as @entity96 puts it : ‘ the @entity33 love luxury			2
’ and , of course , in @entity21 , luxury loves them right back .			2

@entity0 , 25 , loves @entity4 and @entity5
she says going shopping is ‘ like being @entity62 in pretty woman '
