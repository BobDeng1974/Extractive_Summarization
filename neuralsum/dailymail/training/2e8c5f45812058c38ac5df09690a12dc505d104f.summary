there 's something perversely hilarious about watching others have the pants scared off them , which is precisely what happens in the @entity5			0
the haunted house in @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 , uses actors , noises and spooky lighting - though it 's almost always pitch black - in the experience that takes between 10 and 15 minutes			1
while it 's more subtle in its approach to inducing fear , with more of a what you do n't know could hurt you - style thriller scare than blood and gore , the reactions are still priceless			2
the terrifying moment the @entity5 's finest work gets its desired result a young could grab each other in fear at the @entity5 in @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 the nightmares amusement takes between 10 and 15 minutes and includes live and recorded elements while the amusement has run for 30 years , business has boomed in recent years since it began posting the reactions of visitors in @entity35			1
these colourful reactions , usually at a point in the tour when those going through together are holding onto each other , are priceless			0
in the past it 's been said they 've been petrified and made scream by a group of ghosts while in other cases they 've been made to feel like they are in a car crash			0
should it all get too much for them , patrons can use the safe word - ' nightmares ' - but they will then have the indignity of being escorted out safely by staff and go onto the public ' chicken list ' , which has well over 100,000 members			1
before going in , visitors can watch the reactions of others on screens in the lobby , but that does n't seem to have any impact on them being scared witless once it becomes their time			0
along with the actors , who occasionally come into contact with those who do n't appear to appear quite afraid enough , there is a shaky drawbridge , a moment when it feels like the walls are closing in and narrow tunnel which must be crawled through			0
nightmares @entity75 has been uploading the frightened faces of their patrons for several years this petrified trio grapple at each other for comfort as what is said to be a bright light flashes before them a young woman almost appears amused while her male companion 's scream is constant fright or flight : this woman does n't know whether to stay or go as her partner clings on to her the house itself is built where once stood the @entity93			1

in the ensuing struggle , a stack of solid oak coffins overturned and @entity99 was crushed to death ! the guilty ran off and were never apprehended for their part in the gruesome murder			2
' moment of horror : a man and woman hold on to each other while screaming at the tourist attraction not this brave three , but those who ca n't handle the fear factor can say ' nightmares ' to escape early those who use the safe word go onto a public ' chicken list ' , which has well over 100,000 members these guys ca n't look as the ' highlight ' of the tour scares them witless those who brave the factory range from teens up , with eight years old the minimum age limit the man at the front of this human chain looks the most petrified ' i 'm outta here !
