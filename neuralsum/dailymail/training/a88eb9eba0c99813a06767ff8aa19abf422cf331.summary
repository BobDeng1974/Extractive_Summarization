' these are the words of the real - life @entity2 from @entity7 , @entity4			1
in 2008 , even as the fictional @entity2 first began to build his methamphetamine empire on @entity12 's hit show @entity10 , a real meth chef by the same name was arrested doing something almost identical in @entity4			1
that same year , @entity20 , @entity4 's most successful meth cook was also making the purest meth east of the @entity23 experienced : @entity2 had been making meth for ten years			1

life imitating art : in real - life , @entity2 was alerted to the fact the authorities were onto him and watching his every move			1

' i bought tools , four - wheelers , cars , trucks , you name it			0
i just stockpiled the money , ' @entity2 said			0

looking back now , it 's hard to believe that i could go through that much money in one day			0
' he would drop the drop the drugs off at a certain spot and then come back the next day to a seculded spot in the countryside to pick up the cash			0
unlike @entity2 in the show , played by actor @entity64 , real - life @entity2 was not dying of cancer and was not chased by his own brother in - law			1
but like in the show , it was not an easy ride			0

his partner , @entity192 , continued to work and was arrested by the police several times			0
@entity2 later went back into making drugs in another county until he was finally arrested			2
family values : @entity2 grew apart from his family including his son , @entity200 , ( right ) but now he says he is working to repair relationships - after all , they managed to survive without him thinking about the future : @entity2 knows that he could go to jail for the rest of him life when he has his trial in march 2014 but he resigns himself to the fact he will no longer be hurting anyone but himself @entity2 has since been sent to and graduated from a court - ordered long - term faith - based recovery program at the @entity118 in @entity7 , @entity4			1
