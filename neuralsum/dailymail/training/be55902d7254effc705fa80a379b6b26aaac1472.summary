by @entity0 published : 13:32 est , 9 december 2013 updated : 14:34 est , 9 december 2013 an independent adoption agency desperate to find children a home has resorted to advertising them in local newspapers			1
@entity6 placed full page adverts in three newspapers in @entity9 in a bid to find loving families for ' @entity12 ' , four , and ' @entity13 ' , three			1
the advert appeals to would - be parents by saying the process of adoption has ' no cost , no waiting time , and no hoops to jump through			1
' @entity6 placed this full - page advert in three @entity9 newspapers appealing to readers to find ' @entity23 ' and ' @entity13 ' homes it appeared in the @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity26 and @entity27 , though the children featured are not thought to be local and have had their names changed			1
@entity30 , a service director at @entity6 , has defended the adverts saying the company needed to find an ' imaginative ' way to encourage adoption , as the number of children looking for a home reached 4,000			1
she said : ' basically the situation is there are four thousand children in the @entity41 who need a family and a lot of authorities are struggling to find them			1
' there is a lot of pressure on them to try and be a bit more creative			0
this advert is a new thing			2
it is us trying something different and it is unusual			0
' it is very easy when you just switch on the news and they say ' blah blah blah ' but this kind of thing makes it seem more real			0
' we just hope this could inspire interest			0
we try to get rid of myths like that you have to be in a relationship to adopt. ' i think the fact that there are so many children in the @entity41 that need a home is desperately sad and we want to do everything we can			0
' but some have slammed the campaign saying children should not be advertised in such a way that is ' unconcerned ' with finding them a suitable home			0
the agency that was commissioned by a local authority that can not be named for legal reasons has defended the advert as ' an imaginative ' way to find children homes @entity87 mp said the advert sent out the wrong message and would not serve the purpose of finding a safe home for vulnerable children			1
the liberal democrat , who represents @entity93 , said : ' if parents with children did something like that they would go to jail			1
' we are supposed to protect the identity of children by not naming them or keeping their identity secret			0
@entity106 condemned the advert as ' unconcerned ' with finding the children suitable homes ' i find it very odd that local authorities are so keen to keep a child 's identity secret one minute but then change their minds when it suits them			1
' they seem to be unconcerned about the household that children end up in			0
' it is about box ticking rather than finding them a good home			0
' the independent agency was commissioned by a local authority , which can not be named to protect the children 's identities , to find the boys homes			1
@entity6 is monitored by watchdog @entity128 and was rated as outstanding in five different categories in february this year			2
staff were described as ' forward thinking ' and praised for being ' extremely effective ' in finding homes for vulnerable children			2
the @entity133 ( @entity133 ) said they welcome new ways of encouraging prospective parents , adding : ' it 's not something new to us as we are always trying to find ways of rehoming children			1
' ' we are very careful about where we feature children			0
we normally change their names or do n't talk about location			0
' there are over 4,000 children who need to be adopted every year and and there is always the need for parents to come forward			2
' it is hard to find homes for older kids and siblings especially			2
' sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0

@entity6 placed the advert in three @entity9 newspapers
it appeals to would - be parents to *provide* two little boys ' loving homes '
