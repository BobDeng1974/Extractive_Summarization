did you wake up this morning feeling like you 'd mysteriously lost of an hour of sleep ? well , technically , you did , because today is the start of @entity4 for most @entity6 states and territories			2
in the very early hours of this morning , the clock jumped forward by an hour - from 1.59am straight to 3.00am - effectively wiping an hour from your life			0
make sure your clocks are set an hour forward ( if they have n't switched over automatically already ) an extra hour to spend at the beach ? sounds like a pretty good deal most likely you wo n't have noticed as your smartphones and computers should have automatically ticked over already for @entity4 - which will last until sunday the 5th of april next year			1
but the good news is , besides getting that lost hour back in a few months ' time , that you 'll get an extra hour of sunshine at the end of each day over summer			0
daylight saving in @entity24 has come into effect if you live in @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity24			0
@entity31 , the @entity32 and @entity33 do not follow @entity4 , meaning residents of those areas will keep their regular time zones			1
the following time zones are now in effect , per the @entity40 website			0
@entity41 : @entity31 @entity41 : @entity27 ( except @entity42 ) , @entity28 , @entity43 , @entity29 @entity41 : @entity24 and @entity42 , @entity27 @entity41 : @entity32 @entity41 : @entity33 do n't forget to set your watch and check your alarms are an hour forward - you do n't want to be caught out at work this week .			1

clocks move forward by an hour to mark beginning of @entity4
daylight saving is not observed in @entity31 , @entity33 or the @entity32
*adjustment* will last until april 5th , 2015
