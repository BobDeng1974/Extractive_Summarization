by @entity0 worms could be used to fight a range of debilitating autoimmune diseases , research has revealed			2
a molecule in parasitic worms may be used to fight illnesses including multiple sclerosis ( @entity9 ) , psoriasis , rheumatoid arthritis and lupus			1
scientists identified peptides - naturally occurring biological molecules - from the creatures that suppress a body ’s immune response , and they believe it could pave the way for a new drug to provide relief from the often painful symptoms of such diseases			1
scientists have identified peptides - naturally occurring biological molecules - from parasitic worms ( illustrated ) that suppress the body ’s immune response , which could pave the way for a new drug to provide relief from the symptoms of autoimmune diseases there are hopes that a molecule in parasitic worms could fight autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis ( @entity9 ) , psoriasis , rheumatoid arthritis and lupus			1
scientists have identified a peptide from the worms to suppress the body ’s immune response			1
called @entity45 , the peptide dampens the immune system by inhibiting a potassium channel ( @entity48 )			0
they discovered that @entity45 closely resembles @entity50 , a peptide from a sea anemone , which has been shown to suppress autoimmune diseases and is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of multiple sclerosis			2
@entity45 could be an ingredient in a future ‘ worm pill ’			0
the pill could one day be used an alternative to helminthic therapy , which involves people deliberately infecting themselves with parasitic worms in a bid to force their autoimmune disease into remission			1
rare autoimmune diseases affect over 100,000 people in the @entity69 , with many more suffering from rheumatoid arthritis , for example			1
they occur when a person ’s immune system has an abnormal response against its own cells , tissues or even entire organs , resulting in inflammation and damage			0
scientists are unsure exactly what causes the body to turn in on itself , but diagnoses are rocketing in the @entity84			0
‘ there are more than 80 autoimmune diseases , ranging in severity from mild to life threatening in some cases , and while some affect mainly one area or organ , others can affect many parts of the body , ’ said professor @entity85 from @entity86 ( @entity87 ) in @entity88			2
‘ many people believe there ’s a link between the rise in autoimmune diseases and an increased focus on cleanliness in @entity107 societies , because the immune system is no longer exposed to the broad range of infections that previous generations had to deal with			2
a ‘ worm pill ’ ( illustrated ) could one day be used an alternative to helminthic therapy , which involves people deliberately infecting themselves with parasitic worms to force their autoimmune disease into remission ‘ there could be some truth to this because worm infection is virtually unheard of in developed countries , yet the incidence of autoimmune diseases is high			1
but in developing countries the opposite is true			0
’ a ‘ worm pill ’ could one day be used an alternative to helminthic therapy , which involves people deliberately infecting themselves with parasitic worms in a bid to force their autoimmune disease into remission			1
the study , published in the @entity133 ( @entity133 ) journal , said that some experts think the worms have a calming effect on their host 's immune systems in order to ensure their survival			0
a ‘ worm pill ’ may be off putting to some people , so the researchers have isolated the active components responsible for immunomodulatory effects - the treatment of disease by inducing , enhancing , or suppressing an immune response - in parasitic worms			1
they created a @entity150 library from the secretory glands of the @entity153 parasitic hookworm			0
a molecule in parasitic worms could fight illnesses including multiple sclerosis ( @entity9 ) , psoriasis , lupus and rheumatoid arthritis ( illustrated by this coloured x-ray ) the scientists identified a peptide called @entity45 that dampens the immune system by inhibiting a potassium channel ( @entity48 )			1
they discovered that @entity45 closely resembles @entity50 , a peptide from a sea anemone , which has been shown to suppress autoimmune diseases and is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of multiple sclerosis			2
dr @entity171 from the university , said the study will help in developing new drugs to treat autoimmune diseases			0
‘ our research shows that it is possible to identify individual molecules responsible for this beneficial effect , ’ he said			0
‘ the next step will be to see if we can develop this into a pill that could dampen the immune system in people with an autoimmune disease			0
that ’s a whole lot cleaner than putting a worm in your body			0

a molecule in parasitic worms could fight autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis , psoriasis , rheumatoid arthritis and lupus
scientists at @entity201 , @entity88 , identified peptides from parasitic worms that suppress the body ’s immune response
molecules could be used in a new drug to *quash* symptoms of autoimmune diseases , which affect hundreds of *thousands* of people in the @entity69
' worm pill ' could one day be used an alternative to helminthic therapy , which involves people infect themselves with live parasitic worms
