by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 07:17 est , 7 march 2013 updated : 04:18 est , 8 march 2013 a fifth of income tax goes straight to funding @entity7 ’s vast benefits bill , new figures show as @entity9 @entity8 step up their call for more cuts to welfare			1
the average taxpayer now spends more than £ 1,100 each on benefits , excluding pensions , while a further £ 370 goes on paying interest on the nation ’s debts			1
chancellor @entity19 is coming under @entity21 pressure ahead of this month ’s budget to find more savings from welfare as ministers resist deeper cuts to defence , police and business			1
speaking in @entity45 , the prime minister said there was no ‘ magic money tree ’ that allowed the government to spend and borrow more			0
as early as next year , every taxpayer will get a personal annual statement revealing how each pound taken from them by the revenue is spent			1
however a breakdown released in a parliamentary question shows that welfare payments , not including the bill for the state pension , account for 22.4 per cent of income tax paid – worth £ 1,166.32 for the average worker			1
treasury minister @entity61 revealed debt interest payments amount to 7.1 per cent of income tax bills , or £ 369.91			1
speaking at precision grinding engineers @entity66 , mr @entity36 said warned there was no ' magic money tree ' to fund tax cuts or spending @entity71 has made clear that £ 3.5billion of extra cuts to welfare were announced in last year ’s @entity74 , and do not necessarily expect more			1
however , @entity9 @entity8 believe taking the axe to benefits will be more popular with voters than cutting spending elsewhere			1
mr @entity19 will deliver his fourth budget on march 20 , as @entity21 colleagues battle it out to defend their departments from more cuts			1
the revelation that one pound in five of our income tax goes on benefits will alarm those demanding the axe between to the welfare state			1
@entity9 mp @entity91 said the figures showed the need to cut welfare more @entity9 mp @entity91 , who obtained the figures , told @entity96 , said : ‘ these figures from the government show the astonishing amount of tax low earners are paying for welfare benefits			1
‘ the @entity102 want to impose a further welfare tax on low earners by spending billions more on benefits and oppose every measure the government takes to try to cut low earners ’ tax bills			1
‘ these figures are why we need to continue to reform welfare urgently			2
’ mr @entity91 warned against increasing public spending in any areas , adding : ‘ we should reallocate existing spending on tax cuts , for cutting fuel duel duty for example			1
’ in a major speech on the economy yesterday , mr @entity36 refused to change course but hinted at further welfare cuts			1
he rejected the accusation from opponents , including the @entity102 , that the government is ploughing ahead with austerity to make ' the numbers add up with no care whatsoever for what it means for people affected by the changes we make '			2
the prime minister said : ' nothing could be further from the truth			0
my motives for sticking to the plan are exactly about doing the right thing to help families and business up and down the country			0
' why ? because we want to look after people in their old age , and we wo n’t be able to do that if we ’re squandering billions on welfare for people who could work			2
' because we want to help people into work and break the cycle of poverty , and we ’ve seen that ever increasing working - age welfare is not the answer			2
' mr @entity19 has faced resistance from senior ministers over demands for more cuts to their budgets from 2015			1
defence secretary @entity161 said at the weekend that there is a ‘ body of opinion within @entity21 who believes that we have to look at the welfare budget again ’			2
he added that he would resist further cuts to the defence budget , and would not offer more troop number reductions in the 2015 - 16 spending review			2
home secretary @entity172 is also resisting further cuts to her budget			2
mr @entity19 is understood to be ' relaxed ' about cabinet ministers ' fighting it out amongst themselves ' over where future spending cuts should fall			1
a @entity32 source said : ' we have been clear that if we want to do less on cutting departments we have to do more on cutting welfare because the overall envelope is set			2
' mr @entity19 is under pressure to ease the cost of living			1
using 2005 as a baseline , the @entity187 rate of inflation has risen markedly , according to figures from the @entity191 however , business secretary @entity192 has broken ranks to suggest capital spending , funded by borrowing , may be needed to kick - start growth			0
he told the @entity197 that the government ’s decision to stick to @entity102 ’s plan to cut capital spending was a mistake which had ‘ economic consequences ’			0
mr @entity192 said there was now a legitimate debate about whether the government should ‘ borrow more , at very low interest rates , in order to finance more capital spending - building of schools and colleges , small road and rail projects , more prudential borrowing by councils for house building			2
’ he told the magazine that the strategy ‘ does not undermine the central objective of reducing the structural deficit , and may assist it by reviving growth ’			0
the prime minister warned abandoning @entity223 would mean interest rates will rise , homes will be repossessed and businesses will go bust mr @entity192 also launched a withering attack on the @entity227 , describing their analysis of @entity7 ’s economic problems as a ‘ saloon - bar whine about health and safety inspectors , newts and birds that block new development , bloody - minded workers , equalities legislation and @entity239 who dream up regulations for square tomatoes and straight bananas			0
’ he said the coalition had been right to clamp down on spending more broadly in order to restore market confidence in the @entity7			0
the prime minister warned abandoning @entity223 would mean interest rates will rise , homes will be repossessed and businesses will go bust however , mr @entity36 used his pre-budget speech to warn @entity7 must stick to its deficit reduction programme or risk being plunged ‘ back into the abyss ’			0
' there are some people who think we do n't have to take all these tough decisions to deal with our debts , ' he said			0
' they say that our focus on deficit reduction is damaging growth			0
and what we need to do is to spend more and borrow more			0
' it 's as if they think there 's some magic money tree			0
well , let me tell you a plain truth : there is n't			0
' @entity273 understood that a tax cut paid for by borrowed money is no tax cut at all when she said : " i ’ve not been prepared , ever , to go on with tax reductions if it meant unsound finance "			0
' mr @entity36 added : ' so yes , we are doing a great deal to help hard working families			0
but all of these changes have to be paid for – and they have been paid for			0
' the remarks will be seen as a sharp rebuttal to the calls from both @entity287 and @entity288 for a change of direction .			0
