by @entity0 italians are known for their generous portions at dinnertime but one family restaurant has taken it to a whole other level			2
@entity7 , an @entity9 restaurant in @entity10 , @entity11 , has seen more than half a million people take on its @entity13 over the last 23 years - that averages out at more than 60 people a day - but only 15 have finished the 7,000 calorie feast			1
the 6lb feast has only been finished by 15 people in 23 years , out of more than 500,000 attempts anyone who manages to complete the challenge at @entity23 's @entity22 , left , does not have to pay the $ 40.90 price tag for the 6lb lasagna and gets an ' i ate the plate ! ' t - shirt , right , as a reward @entity33 cheese - 800 calories1lb @entity31 cheese - 1800 calories1lb mozzarella cheese - 1300 calories1lb bolognese - 1500 calories2lb pasta sheets - 1600 calories the rules are simple , customers attempt to eat a 6lb serving of the traditional favourite and , if they manage to clear the plate , they get the meal for free and a t - shirt that read ' i ate the plate ! '			1
if they fail , as almost everyone does , they have to fork out $ 40.90 ( Â£ 24 ) for their trouble			0
the last successful attempt was more than a year ago			0
@entity47 , 48 , the restaurant 's general manager and the man behind the challenge , said : ' i put the dish on the menu because it 's hilarious watching people fail			1
' also lasagne is a classic , staple meal for @entity9 - @entity57 as well as across the world			1
so it seemed like the perfect challenge to offer			0
' all kinds of men and women have attempted the challenge			0
' and customers go crazy trying to complete it			0
people jump around trying to work up an appetite midway through the meal			2
' unfortunately , i 've seen a lot of people throw - up attempting to do it too ! ' the monstrous meal contains 1lb or @entity75 cheese , 1lb of @entity74 , 1lb of @entity77 cheese , 1lb of bolognese sauce ( containing beef , veal and pork ) , and 2lb of pasta .			2
