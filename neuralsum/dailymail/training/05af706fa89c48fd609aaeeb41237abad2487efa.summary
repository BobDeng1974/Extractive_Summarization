@entity1 goalkeepers @entity2 and @entity3 have ended their feud over claims made in the former 's book			1
veteran @entity9 shot - stopper @entity3 was accused in his fellow @entity1 's book @entity11 of looking to prevent @entity2 's move to @entity13 going through in 2003 , a claim he labelled ' ludicrous '			1
@entity2 , now with @entity15 , accepts his fellow goalkeeper 's version of events and future print runs of the book will be amended to reflect this			1
@entity2 has accepted @entity3 's version of events about a move falling through with @entity13 veteran @entity9 keeper @entity3 said claims he sabotaged @entity2 's move were ' ludicrous ' the disagreement stemmed from a letter of recommendation @entity2 asked @entity3 , then playing for @entity29 , to sign on his behalf as he attempted to secure a work permit for his move from the @entity34 / @entity33			1
@entity3 felt the letter contained numerous inaccuracies that he was not prepared to put his name to - but disputed the assertion that he then wrote to the @entity39 opposing @entity2 's move			1
@entity2 posted a statement on his @entity42 feed on tuesday evening in an attempt to bury the hatchet			2
@entity2 , claim a corner against @entity46 on monday , will amend future editions of his book @entity11 @entity3 says he did n't sign a letter of recommendation for @entity2 as it contained a number of inaccuracies it read : ' in telling the story of my move to @entity13 from @entity57 , i describe at length a number of obstacles that potentially stood in the way of a massive career - changing opportunity			1
one of many such obstacles that i discuss in this context is opposition to my work permit by the @entity39 and , as i understood at the time , @entity3			2
' @entity3 takes issue with my characterisation of his position and ( the ) events			2
at the time , i was surprised that @entity3 would not automatically sign my letter of recommendation , and i took this as an opposition to my application			2
@entity3 later explained that he had not in fact opposed my efforts to seek a work permit , either by writing to the @entity39 or otherwise			0
' i have decided to take @entity3 at his word			0
accordingly , i have directed my publisher to amend future copies of my book by striking reference to @entity3 's opposition			1
' @entity3 , now with @entity9 , then reposted the statement , adding : ' glad it 's over , happy to move on			2
' in the original book , @entity2 wrote : ' the legal team at @entity13 ... told me that @entity3 had n't merely refused to sign a statement on my behalf , he had actively tried to block my transfer			1
he 'd written to the appeals committee suggesting that i should n't be given a work permit at all			0
' @entity2 and @entity3 embrace after a @entity97 game between @entity15 and @entity98 in 2009 @entity3 responded to @entity99 on december 4 : ' i never sabotaged , and i never stood in the way of @entity2 getting a work permit			1
' ( the letter ) was sent to me , and the only thing that was true on it was my name			0
the letter was full of exaggerations that the people on the @entity39 and appeals committee would have seen through			0
' it said that i had been in direct competition with @entity2 for the starting job on the @entity1 national team for the last two years , when anyone who follows ( @entity1 ) soccer knew it was between @entity118 ( @entity119 ) and i. ' yes , i refused to sign that			0
we got the letter and said " we have to change this , because this is n't true			0
" we made our changes and sent it back			0
they did n't like what i was going to sign , so they did n't use it			0
and that was the end of the matter			0
