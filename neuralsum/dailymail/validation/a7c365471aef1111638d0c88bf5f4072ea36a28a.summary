@entity0 leapt high , and powered a fantastic header looping over the head of @entity3 into the far corner of @entity6 's net , dumping @entity8 's team out of the @entity9			1
it was , undoubtedly , a brilliant piece of play from the @entity12 , but immediately the inquest began as to how @entity6 had allowed the centre back so much space			0
the answer , it seems , is that captain @entity18 , rather than marking his opponent , was tussling with his central defensive partner as the corner came in			0
as the corner comes into the box , @entity18 grabs hold of @entity24 , who is running towards his own goal @entity18 is clearly grappling with his team - mate as he attempts to move towards @entity0 @entity18 did eventually reach @entity0 , but by then the @entity12 had jumped high to head the ball home with the ball in the air , @entity18 can be seen grappling with @entity24 , as both @entity6 men get caught under the ball			1
@entity18 did eventually find a way past his colleague , but arrived too late and could n't get off the ground , leaving @entity0 free to head home			2
the goal drew @entity38 level on the night , and in the tie , but the vital second away goal sent the visitors through to the quarter - finals			0
it was also the second goal @entity6 had conceded from a corner to a @entity38 centre half , after @entity47 had sent the game to extra time			0
the @entity38 captain still had plenty to do , but his looping header gave @entity3 no chance at all @entity0 celebrates the goal that knocked @entity6 out of the @entity9 at the last 16 stage the @entity6 players trudge back towards the halfway line , despondent after twice conceding a lead			1
