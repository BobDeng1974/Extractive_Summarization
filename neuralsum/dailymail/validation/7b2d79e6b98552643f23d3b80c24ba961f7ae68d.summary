it still clearly rankles with @entity1 that injury saw him miss out on a @entity4 final appearance with @entity5 in what now seems like another dimension , never mind seven short years ago			1
but the @entity9 star has revealed that it ’s the memory of that heartbreaking episode which is spurring him on to reach this season ’s @entity4 showpiece with @entity15			1
@entity17 ’s men host @entity18 tonight at @entity19 in the first leg of their last - 16 tie and the hosts are expected to progress against one of the competition ’s lowest - ranked sides			1
@entity1 consoles @entity27 after @entity5 ' defeat in the @entity30 final @entity1 is determined to make up for that defeat , and missing the final , with @entity15 this season @entity34 ’s last remaining representatives in the tournament will have their work cut out to go all the way , with the likes of @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 also still in contention			1
but @entity1 is adamant they have what it takes to challenge for the club ’s second continental honour after the @entity48 was claimed three decades ago - and are ready to go one step better than @entity5 did in 2008 when they lost to @entity42 in @entity50			1
in his first campaign at @entity52 after leaving @entity53 , @entity1 appeared as a sub in a crucial 1 - 1 draw at @entity56 that gave @entity58 ’s side an away goals victory			1
he was also among the replacements at @entity61 and in both meetings with @entity63 as the @entity64 kept progressing			0
but four days before the first semi-final with @entity66 , he suffered a cruciate knee ligament injury in a last - four @entity68 tie with @entity69			0
@entity1 , and his then manager @entity58 , walk past the trophy in 2008 the @entity15 forward ( far left ) trains with his team - mates ahead of their tie against @entity18 that ended @entity1 ’s quest for @entity76 glory			1
he was a spectator at the final and did n’t play again competitively for another nine months			2
‘ i played in @entity79 back then and was on the bench a couple of times afterwards but then i got injured at @entity82 , ’ recalled the 28 - year - old			0
‘ i missed the semi-finals and the final and i remember watching the penalty shoot - out in @entity86 that took us through on tv and i did n’t feel 100 per cent part of it			1
it was a great feeling to see the team win but i had n’t travelled and it wasn ’ t great to feel i was missing out			2
‘ this is an opportunity to make up for that			2
there was still a great buzz from sitting watching the final from the sidelines in @entity50			2
it was fantastic but it also makes me think now i ’d love to get that feeling again and hopefully go one better , play in the final and win it			1
that ’s what drives me on			0
‘ it ’s not just that i never got to play back then but also that i want to experience the feeling we had around the club from getting to the final in the first place			2
' this season when we ’ve been playing in @entity115 , it has crossed my mind that the experiences i had with @entity5 can help me , especially at this stage in the tournament			1
the disappointment of seven years ago , and his failure to influence it , still haunts the @entity9 striker ‘ we had to be very resilient and well organised in 2008			2
@entity124 found it difficult to break us down and we did well to counter and create chances that way			0
' we rode our luck a bit as well and i look at that and think it was great we got so far			0
it ’s something @entity15 can look to do now too and we ’ve been similar			1
‘ in the group stage , things went flawlessly and we played every game perfectly			0
we were very solid in the last round against @entity137 as well			0
' as things go on , we know it will get tougher and tougher but at this stage we feel we can go further and go as far as the final			2
’ while many @entity144 sides have looked upon the @entity4 as a distraction from domestic matters in recent seasons , that has n’t been the case at @entity15			1
@entity17 has purposely picked strong sides to keep his team ’s run going , rather than sacrifice participation in the competition for the sake of concentrating more on the @entity156			0
@entity1 wants to get his hands on the trophy he came so close to with his former club @entity5 that has impacted on the club ’s domestic performance and they lie 14th in the top flight - but hopes remain high they can strike a balance on both fronts			1
@entity1 added : ‘ after working so hard last season and being so close to the top four in the league , this was our reward			1
i do n’t think you can treat the @entity4 as if it ’s not worth going 100 per cent for - and the manager has shown that in his team selections			1
‘ sometimes we have found it hard to deal with having games so close together and , with a few injuries , our squad has been a bit tight because of that			0
' we ’ve not had many players we can rotate but full credit to the manager for keeping a strong stance in @entity115			0
that ’s why we have done so well in the competition and he will want to keep doing the same			0
’ @entity186 are n’t the same force they ’ve been in the past but @entity1 still rates them and is wary of the damage they can cause on @entity192 this evening			1
he remains confident , however , that if @entity15 perform the way they can , they will keep up their challenge for silverware			2
‘ @entity18 are a very good team			2
we ’ve watched them on video and we ’ ll continue to do so right up to the game			0
they do n’t get as much air time as many other sides and they ’re not seen to be as glamorous but they are dangerous with very good players			0
' we will need to watch them and be at our best but we came through one of the toughest groups which included @entity205 and @entity39			0
‘ to have done that with the quality we have , i do n’t think we will worry about any team			0
we believe in the way we play and if we are at our best , we can trouble anyone			0

@entity1 missed 2008 @entity4 final when a @entity5 player
the forward wants to win the competition with @entity15 to make amends
@entity15 take on @entity18 on *thursday* in competition *'s* last 16
