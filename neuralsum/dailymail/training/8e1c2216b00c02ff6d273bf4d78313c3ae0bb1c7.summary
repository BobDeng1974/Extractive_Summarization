when @entity2 found out her three - day - old son @entity3 had severe haemophilia , all she could think about was how much pain she watched her father go through when she was growing up			1
mrs @entity2 , from @entity6 in @entity7 , always knew there was a risk she would pass on the rare and incurable bleeding disorder to her children because her dad suffered from it his whole life			1
but the 37 - year - old could n't help but burst into tears when she thought about what it would mean for her baby			2
' you can see in photos he just looks frail , he still had a good life and he had a wife and kids but he did suffer a lot of pain			0
' when i found out with @entity3 i thought it would be the same thing , that i 've brought this baby into the world and he 's not going to be able to play sport and he 'll have all this trouble			0
' because her father - who died in 2009 at the age of 64 - had haemophilia , mrs @entity2 is a carrier and her children have a 50 - 50 chance of suffering from the disorder			1
almost all people with haemophilia - including about 2800 @entity54 - are male			1
men with haemophilia transmit the gene to their daughters , but not their sons			2
@entity3 's two - year - old brother @entity60 is also a haemophilia sufferer			1
the family live in @entity6 in @entity7 @entity2 ( second from left ) is a carrier of the disorder because her father had it			1
her youngest son @entity66 ( third from left ) does n't have it but her 12 - year - old daughter @entity68 ( third from right ) may carry the gene women who carry the gene may transmit the gene to their son , who will have haemophilia , or their daughter who can also carry the gene			1
@entity3 , now 10 , and mrs @entity2 ' two - year - old son @entity60 both have haemophilia , but her five - month - son @entity66 does n't			1
her 12 - year - old daughter @entity68 does n't suffer from the disorder but they have yet to test whether she is a carrier			1
mrs @entity2 says @entity3 is , thankfully , able to do most things boys his age can do			1
treatment has advanced greatly since the days of her childhood and @entity3 is able to receive a factor @entity89 injection – which adds a protein that helps the blood to clot – every two days			0
' he 's a sporty , active kid and he loves to be outside , ' mrs @entity2 said			1
@entity3 has recently learnt how to do the factor viii injection himself – something that has proven very helpful when trying to teach @entity60 ( pictured ) about his own injections mrs @entity2 ' father @entity97 and mother @entity97 ' he 's energetic , he plays soccer , he plays tennis , he does triathlons , likes riding his bike , riding his scooter , jumping on the trampoline			1
' thankfully there is this factor replacement , he would be tearing his hair out if he was n't able to do those things			0
' but there are still risks			0
it is a myth that he could bleed to death from a tiny cut , but if @entity3 were to have a big fall he would suffer immensely from internal bleeding			2
' when they cut themselves or fall over and things that type of bleeding is n't a concern , ' mrs @entity2 said			1
' the problem for severe haemophiliacs is the bleeding on the inside of your body			2
almost all people with haemophilia - including about 2800 @entity54 - are male			1
men with haemophilia transmit the gene to their daughters , but not their sons @entity3 is a sporty , active kid who loves to be outside and play sports like soccer and tennis ' the biggest fear is any head bleeding , with a bad fall they could have bleeding on the brain which could cause a world of problems and could potentially be fatal			2
' at 10 years old @entity3 already suffers from arthritis in his ankle because it has had so many internal bleeds at that spot			0
@entity3 has recently learnt how to do the factor viii injection himself – something that has proven very helpful when trying to teach @entity60 about his own injections			2
' even for @entity3 , @entity3 grew up seeing my dad have to have factor sometimes , and we would say " you can be brave like @entity162 " , ' she said			0
' now that 's the same for @entity60 , we say " @entity164 's having his factor , @entity164 's brave , he does n't cry "			2
after winning a competition at the @entity167 at @entity168 he is starring as the lead character in a new comic book aimed at helping kids better understand the disorder ' as much as you do n't want to have two sons have haemophilia in some ways it 's nice they can go through it together			0
' but his little brother is n't the only haemophilia sufferer @entity3 is set to help			0
after winning a competition at the @entity167 at @entity168 he is starring as the lead character in a new comic book aimed at helping kids better understand the disorder			0
' he loves it , he was so excited , ' she said			0
' he took it straight to school to show his friends and teachers			0
' which is nice because he would never have so much to smile about in terms of his haemophilia otherwise			0
' the @entity196 series was developed by @entity197 in collaboration with the @entity199 - a specially designed unit for families dealing haemophilia – at the @entity167			0
it will be launched on thursday morning by @entity3 and shark - attack survivor and @entity206 diver @entity205 .			0
