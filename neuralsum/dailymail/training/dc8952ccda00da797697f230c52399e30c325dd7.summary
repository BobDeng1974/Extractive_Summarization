poignant : the moment @entity6 is reunited with her mother @entity2 , two decades after she was snatched from her grandmother 's home and taken hundreds of miles away to be sold into adoption moving : mrs @entity2 had feared that she would never see her daughter again , but they have been reunited thanks to a nationwide dna database set up five years ago to trace lost children in @entity13 @entity6 embraces her mother : she was one of the tens of thousands of children kidnapped every year in @entity13 it comes after 25 years of heartache			1
on the day @entity6 was taken , mrs @entity2 and her husband , @entity32 , had left her with her grandmother while they went out to work			1
' my mother - in - law knew that our daughter was well - behaved , so she had n't bothered to lock the door when she went shopping , ' said mrs @entity2			1
' when she came back 30 minutes later the house was empty and daughter had vanished			0
' despite scouring the area for weeks and filing reports with the authorities they were unable to find @entity6			2
@entity6 in an old photo : kidnappers struck while @entity6 was at her grandmother 's house , where her mother and father had left her while they were at work the grandmother died broken - hearted four years ago , but mrs @entity2 and her husband refused to give up hope			1

@entity13 suffers from an epidemic of child kidnapping , with tens of thousands abducted every year for sale into adoption , forced labour and prostitution			1
but @entity6 had been lucky			2
rather than face the sad fate of many of @entity13 's snatched children she had ended up with a good family in @entity73 , a city in @entity75 province , who believed they were adopting an abandoned child			2
@entity6 's adoptive parents had paid money for her , but they believed the cash was to grease the wheels of @entity13 's notorious bureaucracy and speed up the adoption process			1
they gave the girl the surname @entity87 , and when she was eight her parents told her that she was adopted			0
this year she finally decided to search for her real parents and she , too , gave a sample to the database			2
@entity6 , now 29 , said : ' my adoptive parents had two sons but no daughter , so they had arranged to adopt me			2
i was the oldest child in the family			0
' i have to say they treated me very well , i do n't have any complaints , but i wanted to find out who my real parents were			0
i wanted to tell them i was okay and did n't want them to have any regrets			0
' mrs @entity2 and her daughter as a toddler : the grandmother died broken - hearted four years ago , but mrs @entity2 and her husband were some of the first to leave samples with dna database when it was set up in 2009 ' i was determined not to cry , but when i saw the beautiful young woman my daughter has become i could n't help it , ' said mrs @entity2 after she was reunited with @entity6 at @entity114 in the city of @entity116 estimates of the number of kidnapped children in @entity13 range from 10,000 per year to as high as 70,000			1
most parents who lose children stand very little chance of getting them back			0
mrs @entity2 believed that she was also destined to never see her daughter again			0
but then she got the call from police to say that they had a match for her dna - her daughter had been found			0
she said : ' i could n't believe it , i was almost too scared to believe it			0
but then i bought a ticket straight away and flew to meet her			0
