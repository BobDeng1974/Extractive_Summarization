it was difficult to know what must have been more difficult for @entity2 , stepping back out onto the court or facing the inevitable - if - polite probes about how she was feeling after her split with @entity7			1
the @entity8 tackled both with dignity but the most traumatic week in her life - which reports say involved being dumped in a three - minute phone conversation - had not got a whole lot better as she lost in the @entity16 first round and perhaps the only consolation was that she can get her life back together away from the spotlight			1
choosing her words carefully about her personal situation , she dispelled any suggestions that the break - up was ‘ mutual ’			1
' obviously you ’re not prepared for something like this , and it came as a bit of a shock , ' she said			2
it did not help that she faced a rejuvenated opponent in @entity40 ’s @entity38 , who defeated her 7 - 6 , 4 - 6 , 6 - 2			1
something to do with that was that @entity2 has also had to contend with a knee injury recently on top of everything else			1
following the match , looking pale , drawn and possibly a little thinner , she took some questions , although asked that they be related purely to the match she just played			0
that was being somewhat optimistic but she held her head high throughout			0
in fact her exit attracted at least as much attention as what was a far bigger upset in the women ’s draw – the defeat of second seed and former champion @entity79 by @entity81 21 year - old @entity80			1
coinciding broadly with the advent of her high profile relationship with the @entity36 golfer , @entity2 ’s star purely as a tennis player has fallen somewhat , and as number 13 seed her loss was not of the seismic variety by comparison			1
so long : @entity2 waves goodbye after losing the first round match of the @entity16 not going to plan : @entity2 sits on her chair as she ponders her performance ' i just tried to prepare the best that i could			1
it does n’t make it easier that i have n’t been able to play many matches because i have been injured			0
i felt a bit rusty out there , it was n’t really a pretty match but i tried			0
' she added that there was never a question that she would withdraw : ' i always wanted to play here , you need to keep moving forward			0
this is what i do and is my profession			0
' a large @entity40 contingent in the crowd were pulling for their player but respectful enough : ' the crowd was great , i definitely ca n’t blame anyone but myself out there today , ' she said			2
' i would rather have been her longer but it ’s not to be			0
i guess what ’ s supposed to happen will happen			0
so i ’m just going to get myself together and prepare for the grass			0
@entity122 is a better surface for me			0
' her eyes only reddened up when talking about the support she had from her family , especially her father @entity129			0
she 's done it : @entity38 celebrates beating former world @entity132 in the first round of the @entity16 down and out : @entity2 crashed out of the @entity16 at the first round stage for the first time since 2007 ' he means everything to me			1
your family will always be there for you no matter what happens			0
you know you can always talk , always fall back on them , always figure out a way with them to make things better off the court			0
that is always something i have needed and something that has made me the player and person that i am today			0
' last week , @entity7 announced he and @entity2 mutually decided to split only days after sending out wedding invitations			1
the two time major winner and @entity2 confirmed the relationship had ended after he realised he was not ready for marriage			1
the golden couple of sport enjoyed a short - lived engagement after announcing to their million plus @entity162 followers last new year 's eve that they were to marry			2
at the time the pair posted matching pictures of themselves with a ring			2
it is understood the couple - dubbed @entity168 in some circles after a golf wedge was engraved with the moniker - had been an item for more than two years			2
they were forced to scotch rumours of a split late last year			0
as recently as last sunday , @entity7 's @entity162 feed suggested there were no signs of trouble in the relationship after he posted a picture from @entity183 restaurant in @entity184 where the pair had dinner			1
@entity7 and @entity2 spotted on may 15 , shortly before their breakup was announced happier times : @entity2 and @entity7 had been a couple since 2011 and sent out wedding invitations days before their split on sunday , @entity7 won the @entity193 at @entity48			1
it was the first triumph on @entity196 soil for the 25 - year - old and followed a fabulous final - round 66 that saw him overcome a seven - shot final - day deficit to @entity199			2
but while things seem to be going well for the @entity201 , the same can not be said for @entity2 following this defeat from the second @entity203 of the season			2
and in an unfortunate coincidence , @entity2 was wearing a white , orange and green outfit , the colours of the @entity36 flag for her match at @entity16			1
the adidas colours were chosen a couple of weeks ago , before the couple announced their split			2
@entity7 is @entity36 , having been born in @entity213 near @entity214 , but has previously represented @entity215 in golf 's @entity216			1
he must soon decide whether to represent @entity215 or @entity218 at the 2016 @entity219 in @entity220			0
@entity2 is next due to play at @entity221 in the week before @entity122 , although she sounded uncertain , saying @entity221 ‘ was ’ her planned next event			1
hopefully there is much that will be sorted in her head between now and then			0
@entity79 went down 7 - 5 3 - 6 6 - 1 to @entity80 , removing one of the few players who is a threat to @entity229 .			2

@entity2 exits @entity16 in first round for first time since 2007
@entity8 was defeated by 64th seed @entity40 @entity38
former world no 1 wore @entity36 colours week after splitting from @entity7
@entity7 *shrugged* off break - up to win @entity47 on sunday
tennis star suffered unfortunate coincidence of wearing @entity36 colours
