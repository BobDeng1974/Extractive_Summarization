the doctor , who killed the newborns by snipping their necks with scissors at the now - shuttered @entity12 in @entity13 , will serve two consecutive life sentences without parole after giving up his right to appeal			1
@entity1 will be sentenced on wednesday in the death of the third baby , as well as for the involuntary manslaughter conviction after a patient died at the clinic following a drug overdose			1
he will also be sentenced for hundreds of lesser counts of violating the state 's ' informed consent ' law , which says there must be a 24 - hour waiting period before an abortion			1
but @entity1 's own age - 72 - made it unlikely he would ever be executed before his appeals ran out			1
his attorney @entity46 said before the sentencing deal that his client 's bid for acquittal had been a losing battle			0
' the media has been overwhelmingly against him , ' @entity46 said			0
' but i think the jury listened to the evidence ... and they found what they found			2
' @entity1 was pictured smiling as he was led from the court on monday			1
he had been charged with four counts of capital murder , but was found not - guilty on one charge			1
the disgraced doctor was also found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the death of @entity64 , 41 , a refugee who died after a drug overdose following an abortion in november 2010			1

in earlier testimony , the court heard how a clinic employee had photographed @entity83 after dr @entity1 had joked : ' he 's big enough to walk you to the bus stop			1
' clinic workers also testified that they had seen @entity88 , a little girl , move her arm before her neck was snipped , bringing about her death			2
and @entity93 was born in the clinic 's bathroom and was seen struggling to get out of the toilet before a worker also snipped their spine			0
he was found not guilty in the death of @entity101 , who workers had said let out a single cry before the neck was snipped			1
dr @entity1 's attorney @entity46 said they were ' disappointed ' with the verdict			1
defense : @entity1 's lawyer @entity46 speaks following the verdict , which he called ' disappointing ' tragic : he was found guilty of manslaughter in the death of @entity113 , who died after an abortion ' we put on a vigorous defense , ' he told @entity117			1
' we think it went well in the courtroom ... but we respect the jury 's verdict			0
' obviously the jury took their job very seriously ... by the nature of the verdict - both guilty and not guilty verdicts - they obviously thought about the evidence			0
' he added that it was too early to say if he would appeal , and would not comment on whether he thought his client would get the death penalty or whether he would be speaking during the penalty phase , which begins on tuesday next week			0
scene : a police car is seen outside the the @entity12 in 2011 following @entity1 's arrest discarded : bags stashed with body parts , pictured , were also found in the @entity13 clinic ' @entity144 ' doctor @entity1 built up a multimillion dollar property empire from the pain and suffering he inflicted carrying out thousands of illegal abortions			1
with annual earnings of more than $ 1.8m according to prosecutors , the 72 - year - old ' baby killer ' invested his money in a series of properties that included an ocean front home and 18ft sailing boat			0
@entity158 has discovered @entity1 , who faces the death penalty after being found guilty in three out of four murder charges today after cutting the spinal cords of babies during late term abortions , owned at least nine properties in four states			1
they included a $ 900,000 townhouse in @entity13 , a $ 800,000 home overlooking the ocean in @entity169 and several condos			2
investigators are looking to see if he owns further properties , including any abroad , after he refused to respond to a court order telling him to reveal all his assets			0
the @entity175 is interested in the rogue doctor after prosecutors said @entity1 was mostly paid in cash			2
when his home was raided they found $ 240,000 in bundles			0
@entity1 's assets are estimated to be worth several million dollars and all paid for from the 15 abortions a day he carried out for the past 30 years			2
@entity183 the verdict was reached just hours after the seven - woman , five - man jury - which had been deliberating for 10 days - sent out a handwritten note to say it was hung on two counts			0
but after the jury delivered their note , the judge told them they had to agree on the verdict and were sent back to deliberate			0
the jury heard five weeks of testimony before breaking for deliberation on april 30			0
as prosecutors gave their closing arguments in @entity1 's trial two weeks ago , assistant district attorney @entity197 turned to @entity1 and asked ' are you human ? ' - but the doctor simply laughed			1
' my dog was treated better than those babies and women , ' @entity197 said			0
he added that @entity113 's death was the result of @entity1 's ' assembly line ' treatment of patients			2
the defense questioned testimony from staffers who said they had seen babies move , cry or breathe , claiming that the babies had died from abortion - inducing drugs rather than severed spines			0
after weeks of hearing from former employees , @entity1 did not testify , and his lawyer , @entity221 , called no witnesses in his defense			2
he said that the doctor had simply provided desperate , often poor woman with a solution , and he branded prosecutors ' racist ' for attacking @entity1 , who is black and whose patients were largely minorities			2
@entity46 argued that each worker had testified to seeing only a single movement or breath			0
' these are not the movements of a live child , ' @entity46 said			0
' there is not one piece - not one - of objective , scientific evidence that anyone was born alive			0
' painful : @entity239 , a former patient of dr @entity1 , recounts her ordeal at his abortion clinic			1
she said detectives called her three years later to reveal her baby 's foot was found in a fridge nowhere to turn : @entity246 said she went to the clinic after she was raped when she was younger but the prosecutor questioned why else @entity1 and his staff would ' snip ' babies if they were not born alive			1
the brains were intact , so it was not done to make the delivery easier , he said			0
@entity1 's grisly business was discovered more than two years ago when authorities went to investigate prescription drug trafficking at @entity1 's clinic in a low - income area of @entity13			1
instead , they came across blood - splattered operating tables , bags of body parts , unsanitary instruments , jars of severed feet and the stink of cat urine , according to a 2011 grand jury report			0
the tiny fetuses and many of their bodyparts were piled high throughout @entity1 â€™s clinic in cabinets and freezers , in plastic bags , bottles , even cat - food containers			1
the report added that dozens of women were injured at @entity1 's clinic over the past 30 years , calling it a ' house of horrors '			1
some left with torn wombs or bowels , some with venereal disease contracted through the reuse of non-sterilized equipment , and some left with fetal remains still inside them , the report alleged			0
operating table : women were often given such high doses of drugs that they gave birth in the toilet no escape : @entity113 allegedly died after staff had been unable to open this side door for an hour employees at the clinic confirmed that babies were often expelled from their mothers into the toilet			1
on at least one occasion the toilet had to be removed from the floor to ' get the fetuses out of the pipes			0
' former staffers added that patients received heavy sedatives and painkillers from untrained workers while @entity1 was offsite , and were then left in waiting rooms for hours , often unattended			2
@entity1 has been in jail since his january 2011 arrest			2
the business apparently made @entity1 a fortune over the 30 years he was carrying out abortions			2
authorities said that the medical practice netted him about $ 1.8 million a year , and found $ 250,000 hidden in a bedroom when they searched one of his numerous properties			0
eight other defendants have pleaded guilty to a variety of charges and are awaiting sentencing			0
they include @entity1 's wife , @entity332 , a cosmetologist who helped perform abortions .			2

dr @entity1 , 72 , gave up his right to appeal in *exchange* for two consecutive life sentences without parole
he has yet to be sentenced for one murder charge , an involuntary manslaughter charge and hundreds of lesser counts
he was found guilty of killing three babies at his @entity13 clinic
