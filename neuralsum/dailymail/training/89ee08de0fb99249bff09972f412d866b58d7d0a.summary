a @entity1 commentator set out to test the different reactions students at the @entity3 would have when he waved a flag of the terrorist group @entity5 versus when he brandished the flag of @entity7			1
so how did the liberal campus react ? @entity9 , when @entity10 stated his support of @entity5			2
but when he declared himself an @entity7 fan , many students immediately pounced			0
you 'll never believe which flag won him the students ' ire shocker : the video appears to show that the liberal university 's students had little to say about the @entity1 commentator 's support of @entity5 , but were enraged by his subsequent support of @entity7 ' @entity7 is a thief in the night , and a thief in the day , ' said one man			1
another man cursed as he walked past : ' f * * * @entity7 ! ' and yet another person confronts @entity10 to say , ' tyranny is n't cute			2
' @entity10 posted video of his experiment to the @entity1 website on wednesday , writing : ' students at @entity3 clearly have a lot of intellect ; it is one of the most prestigious and selective universities in the country			1
but do they have wisdom ? ' i went to the bucolic campus armed with a flag that represents the greatest evil known today , @entity5			0
if these are our best and brightest then we should all be afraid , very afraid			0
' one person confronts @entity10 to say , ' tyranny is n't cute ' another man turns to using expletives as he walks past			0

@entity10 made a video for @entity1 in which he waves each flag on the liberal *college* 's @entity63 campus
most of the elite students *generally* ignore him as he waves the terrorist group 's *black* and white flag
when he waves the flag of @entity7 flag , he 's cussed at and reprimanded by many who pass
