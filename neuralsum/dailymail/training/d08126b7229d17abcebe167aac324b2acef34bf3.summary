the 84 - year - old was immediately sent to @entity9 in south - west @entity3 after being sentenced to five years and nine months ' jail for a string of indecent assaults against four girls in the @entity14			1
he will only have to serve half that sentence , however , meaning he will be released in less than three years			2
' it saddens me you get more time for money offences than you do for crimes against children , ' she wrote on her @entity35 page			1
ms @entity21 said the parallels between the @entity1 sentencing and that of @entity5 actor @entity40 - her on - screen father who assaulted her and three other young girls during the 1980s and 1990s - ' astound me '			1

in sentencing @entity1 at @entity17 on friday , justice @entity43 said : ' you have shown no remorse for your crimes at all			1
' sexual abuse victim @entity21 ( left ) and children 's rights activist @entity47 ( right ) have condemned @entity1 's actions support : @entity1 was flanked by his wife @entity18 and daughter @entity52 when the jury found him guilty of all counts earlier this week bravehearts founder @entity55 said that was to be expected			1
' the remorse would be a lie anyway , ' ms @entity55 told @entity0			2
' it 's a very , very selfish act to hurt a child			2
you ca n't do it unless you have a lack of empathy			0
' he 's ignorant , self - absorbed and an egomaniac			2
' i think his victims feel vindicated anyway			0
i do n't think they expected remorse from a man like him			0
' after @entity1 was sentenced , one of the four victims in the case said she felt ' very sad ' that the former star continued to deny his crimes			2
the woman , now 52 , was groped at @entity79 in 1978 when she was working as a waitress at a celebrity sporting event			0
count 1 : assaulting autograph - hunter , aged seven or eight , in the 1960s - nine months count 2 : assaulting a teenage waitress in the 1970s - six months count 3 : assaulting a childhood friend of @entity1 's daughter between the ages of 13 and 19 - 15 months count 4 : same victim as count 3 - 15 months count 5 : same victim as count 3 - 15 months count 6 : same victim as count 3 - 12 months count 7 : same victim as count 3 - 15 months count 8 : same victim as count 3 - 12 months count 9 : same victim as count 3 - 12 months count 10 : assaulting @entity5 woman @entity92 , who was 15 , in 1986 - nine months count 11 : same victim as count 10 - nine months count 12 : same victim as count 10 - 12 months ' he knows in his heart of hearts that he did these things , ' she told @entity99			1
' i would have liked him to hold up his hand and say " fair cop , i have done these things "			0
' it would have been a lot braver but he 's a nasty man who took advantage of his position , exploited that to the very utmost , so perhaps we should n't be surprised			0
' the man leading the child sex abuse royal commission in @entity5 says @entity1 's conviction in @entity3 is likely to encourage more victims to come forward			1
justice @entity115 , who chairs the @entity116 into @entity117 , believes victims who have suffered in silence for years are finally opening up thanks to high - profile court cases , inquiries and public condemnation of historical abuse			0
' it is becoming apparent as we do our work that , as the issue of abuse is raised and talked about , survivors increasingly feel able to bring their own story to the authorities , ' @entity125 said			0
' that which may have been kept secret for years may now be told			0
the burden of guilt and shame which many have felt is lifted by knowing that others who have suffered have overcome their reticence			0
' before sentencing , @entity1 's barrister pleaded for leniency due to the fact he was 84			1
' he is already on borrowed time , ' @entity146 told the court			0
' every day , every month in prison is going to shorten his life			0
' but justice @entity115 said survivors who suffered at @entity1 's hands would want him punished notwithstanding his age			1
' they have suffered and , in their minds , so must he			0
' @entity1 's sentence on friday was immediately referred to @entity14 attorney - general @entity157 under the ' unduly lenient sentence scheme '			1
