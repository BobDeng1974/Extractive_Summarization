@entity7 , 39 , described as ' a predatory and manipulative fantasist , ' was arrested last month after being caught loitering outside the @entity12 defender ’s £ 5m mansion			2
the crazed fan had earlier been banned from going near 33 - year old @entity3 , his wife @entity13 , 31 , and their three small children after she repeatedly made a 400 - mile round trip from @entity19 to @entity20 just to call at their family home			1
gesture : the order had banned @entity7 from trying to contact mr @entity3 and his family			1
she has previous convictions including for wounding , criminal damage and assault but last month the footballer ’s security staff were forced to call in police again when she ignored the restraining order by turning up late at night by taxi and began pressing the intercom buzzer			1
when police arrived @entity7 told them , ' my name is @entity7 , and this is my house			0
my belongings are in there			0
' it was not known whether @entity3 and his family were at home at the time			1
@entity7 , from @entity43 , @entity19 , today gave a one fingered salute and yelled abuse as she was led away from @entity47 magistrates court in handcuffs			1
she also vowed to appeal against her jail term after she pleaded guilty to breaching a restraining order			1
@entity52 @entity51 told her : ' your antecedent history makes this offence more serious			0
' predatory fantasist ' : former model @entity7 makes an obscene gesture as she is led out of @entity47 magistrates court in handcuffs today ' you have brought psychological harm to the victims living at the property and you have a history of breaching court orders and a pattern of violent offending			1
' you are a high risk and there is a possibility of serious harm to the victim and also to his family and staff living at the property			0
' @entity7 , who has previous convictions for wounding , criminal damage , assault , public order offences and possessing an offensive weapon , had claimed she was an accomplished athlete with ambitions of becoming a sports agent			2
but she was also said in expert reports to be ' living in a fantasy world , unable to interpret social situations and boundaries			0
' the stalking campaign arose out of claims by @entity7 that she had met the soccer star at the home of his stepfather ’s mother in @entity43 in 1998			1
over a four - month period in 2010 she repeatedly turned up at the @entity94 ’ home in the middle of the night claiming she needed to speak to the footballer to ' resolve some issues			0
' victims : @entity7 has appeared at the @entity3 's family home uninvited on several occasions demanding to see the @entity12 star ( mr @entity3 is seen here with his wife @entity13 ) she was warned by police about her conduct but she claimed she was ' more than ' just a football fan and added : ' he needs to ask his mum why i ’m turning up at his house			1
' @entity7 even told one officer she would be ' packing up and moving in with @entity3 this week or next week			1
' but the former @entity113 captain told the court he had no idea what @entity7 wanted to speak to him about and her actions had left him so alarmed he had thought about installing cctv and additional security at his home			1
he said in a previous court hearing how he had felt ' angry and upset ' about @entity7 's behaviour and was ' worried ' for the safety of his family			1
he said he first met her through a liaison officer at @entity127 in 2006			0
the footballer ’s wife @entity13 said she believed @entity7 was ' obsessed ' with her husband and insisted talk of the stalker having had a relationship with him was ' all lies			0
' in may last year @entity7 was jailed for ten weeks after admitting harassment and was banned from contacting @entity3 and his family for ten years			1
campaign : @entity7 , a former model , has been described as a ' fantasist ' following her stalking campaign against mr @entity3 the order also forbids her from attending any match or public events where he would be present			1
yet on september 21 this year , at 11pm , police were called to the address in @entity147 as she tried once again to make a late night visit			0
in court today @entity7 - of no fixed address , appeared handcuffed in the dock with her hair scraped into a bun , wearing a cream suit jacket and clutching at scraps of paper			2
the court was told she had sacked her solicitor and would be representing herself			0
prosecutor @entity159 said : ' she was made the subject of a restraining order on may 9th last year			2
' that order would bar her from attending or entering @entity147 in @entity20 or communicating with @entity3 and mrs @entity163 and not to go to any venue where he would be in person			0
' this was breached when on september 21st , security officers contacted the police saying that an unknown female was pressing the intercom buzzer			0
' she had got out of a taxi at around 11pm and tried to gain entry , but she was challenged by one of the security officers as she pressed the intercom buzzer			0
' on the police ’s arrival - and knowing of her history and [ the ] restraining order - they promptly arrested her			2
' but she became abusive to the police and was taken to the station and interviewed			0
' she said she had lived there for 15 years and that she did not care about the restraining order			2
' i ’m going straight back there as soon as i get out , ' she said			0
in her defence , @entity7 told magistrates : ' i have nothing to say apart from my belongings are at my home			2
