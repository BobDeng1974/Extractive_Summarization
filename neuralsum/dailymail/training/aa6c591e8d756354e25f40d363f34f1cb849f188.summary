the official album chart will see data online streaming from services such as @entity3 and @entity4 included for the first time from next month			1
data from services including @entity3 , @entity8 and @entity9 will be counted in the chart issued on sunday march 1			1
using a convoluted algorithm to prevent wildly popular singles - such as @entity15 's ' @entity14 ' , which is being streamed 2million times a week - from spiking the rankings , the move will reflect modern changes in music consumption			0
@entity15 's ' @entity14 ' single is being streamed 2million times a week in the last 12 months to january , the number of songs streamed in the @entity22 has doubled to 50 million a day and the singles chart started accepting streaming data in july			2
but an album does not have to be listened to in its entirety - in fact , a stream that counts towards its ranking needs only to be listened to for 30 seconds , @entity25 reported			2
the @entity30 said the change had not been made ' lightly '			1
its chief executive , @entity32 , said : ' the @entity30 's mission is to compile the most accurate , reliable and up - to - date charts around , and in 2015 that means reflecting the popularity of streaming , alongside downloads , vinyl and - still the most popular album format - the cd			1
' initial indications are that the impact on actual chart positions will be modest to begin with , but we expect this to grow as streaming becomes increasingly popular			2
' the data will be weighted so the charts are not skewed by the performance of one or two huge hits			0
the @entity30 will take the 12 most - streamed tracks from each album and the top two will be down - weighted in line with the average of the next 10			0
these streams will then be added together , divided by 1,000 , and then added to the rest of the album 's sales			0
the @entity62 was first published in @entity63 59 years ago - with @entity65 's @entity64 the first number one .			0

official album chart will next month begin using data from online streaming
@entity3 , @entity8 and @entity9 will all be used for the album rankings
but an album does *n't* have to be listened to in its entirety in order to count
the @entity30 said the change had not been made ' lightly '
