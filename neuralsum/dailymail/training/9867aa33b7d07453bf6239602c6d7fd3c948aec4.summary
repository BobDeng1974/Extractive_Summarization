adventurers have stumbled across a cave so enormous that it has its own weather system , complete with wispy clouds and lingering fog inside vast caverns			2
a team of expert cavers and photographers have been exploring the vast cave system in the @entity11 province of @entity12 and have taken the first - ever photographs of the natural wonder			1
they were amazed to discover the entrance to the hidden @entity18 cave system and were stunned when they managed to climb inside to see a space so large that it can contain a cloud			1
three tiny explorers can be seen negotiating the heavily vegetated floor an intrepid cave explorer ascends a rope hanging from the @entity26			2
this photograph is one of the first - ever images taken of one of a cave so large it has its own weather system photographer and caver @entity41 , from @entity43 , was part of a team of 15 explorers on a month - long expedition that discovered the hidden system			1
' a few of the caves had previously been used by nitrate miners , at the areas close to the entrance , but had never been properly explored before , ' he said			1
' all the major passageways were deep underground and had never seen light before			0

a team of expert cavers have been exploring the caves in the @entity11 province of @entity12 the tranquil rural village of @entity68 falls nearby the hidden natural wonder is pictured left , while an intrepid caver stands on the central ridge overlooking the cathedral - like @entity18 , where fog conceals the roof hundreds of metres above ( right ) @entity75 speleologist @entity74 struggles to pull her way across a raging torrent of white water , which is the main river in @entity80			1
one of the explorers said they had to be aware of high water levels inside the caves , especially when it rained heavily on the surface ' it is always very special , knowing that you are the first to step foot into a cave or somewhere where nobody had previously seen , not knowing what you might find and discover			2
' where else on @entity92 can still hold secrets and mysteries of discovery ? that 's what i love so much about exploring			0
mr @entity99 was particularly excited about the cave network 's interior weather system			2

photographer and caver @entity41 , from @entity43 , was part of a team of 15 explorers on a month - long expedition who stumbled across the natural wonder the underground camp in @entity112 is cosy and warm , according to the cavers			1
hot food and drink recharge weary and tired explorers who sleep in either suspended hammocks or on roll mats on the floor , before venturing out into the vast surroundings @entity75 speleologist @entity74 peers down over her shoulder into a giant void of cloud.the floor is over 240m below and although it cant be seen due to the thick cloud that lingers around her , the echo that reverberates several seconds later reminds her of the volume of empty space and her lofty location ' i had never seen anything quite like the inside cloud ladder before , ' he said			1
' thick cloud and fogs hangs in the upper half of the cave , where it gets trapped and unable to escape through the small passage in the roof , 250m above the ground			0
' it reminded me of being in an abandoned slate quarrying @entity145 in bad weather			0
the cave system discovered is not the only one with clouds inside , as humidity rises inside the caverns into colder air to form clouds inside the giant , enclosed spaces			1
large stalagmites at the foot of a giant ascending ramp to another level of development in @entity160 create a spectacle mid-way through a section of cave called @entity164 a giant calcite stalactite boss , dwarfs team member @entity166 as he looks up at the giant geological feature the network , includes ' @entity18 ' which itself measures around 51,000 metres squared , while there are rivers and vegetation on the floor of some of its huge caverns			1
' most caves are either accessed by large walking entrance , some require a long deep swim , other may be very vertical in nature where you need ropes to abseil down the walls deep into the caves			0
' we had to be aware of high water levels inside the caves , especially when it rained heavily on the surface			0
' the drainage catchment to these caves is massive and soon the caves can be extremely dangerous and impassable , ' he added			0
@entity191 and @entity74 walk through a section of cave in @entity160 called @entity194			0
here remains of old @entity196 mining cover the floor in forms of harths - pits and unwanted spoil			0
one team member said it reminded him of being in an abandoned slate quarrying @entity145 in bad weather an explorer scales the rope up a vertical section of cave known as a pit in @entity210 crystal clear pools and slow moving streams make it easier to explore @entity215 main river passage in the huge network of caves that have not welcomed visitors in years			2

the cave system was discovered in the @entity11 province of @entity12 by a team of cavers and photographers
@entity226 @entity41 , from @entity43 , said a few of the caves had previously been used by nitrate miners but had not been properly explored
the network , which includes ' cloud ladder hall ' measuring around 51,000 metres squared , has water *sources* and vegetation of the floor
