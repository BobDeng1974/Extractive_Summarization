by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 15:50 est , 15 january 2014 updated : 07:59 est , 16 january 2014 an @entity4 diplomatic couple kicked out of @entity5 in retaliation for the @entity4 expulsion of an @entity5 envoy triggered a new controversy by posting offensive comments about their former host country on @entity12			1
@entity13 and his wife @entity14 may , from @entity15 , @entity16 , were effectively deported last week by @entity5 authorities			1
but their outrageous comments on social media , including one in which they call @entity5 a ' zoo , ' have only just come to light			1
in one shocking musing , mrs may wrote that @entity5 vegetarians were responsible for a wave of sexual assaults			1
' it 's the vegetarians that are doing the raping , not the meat eaters			0
this place is just so bizarre , ' she wrote			0
then she added : ' applies only to @entity5 , not westerners ! ' racist : @entity4 diplomat @entity13 , pictured right , and his wife @entity14 may , left , have been kicked out of @entity5 after posting offensive comments about their host country on @entity12 vegetarians : in one shocking musing , mrs may wrote that @entity5 vegetarians were responsible for a wave of sexual assaults oops : she later clarified that it was only @entity5 vegetarians doing the raping not @entity52 ones may , who worked as a @entity4 community liaison officer in @entity55 , put up a picture of a cow , regarded by @entity58 as sacred , in a separate post and labeled it ' stupid cow			1
' someone responded to her , ' you just insulted their god			0
' ' not the first time , not the last ! ' she replied seemingly with pride			0
the @entity5 media is abuzz with the story after it revealed the @entity71 ' @entity12 comments , which criticized the country 's air , water , traffic , health conditions and even the @entity5 diet			1
' my pet dog @entity80 looks bigger and in better health ' than the @entity71 ' gardener , @entity13 wrote			0
he added that the dog got ' more protein in his diet than the gardener did			0
' in another , mrs may exclaims ' what a zoo ! ' describing the country			0
after @entity93 blasted the remarks as ' astonishingly offensive ' the @entity92 administration distanced itself from the postings			0
abuzz : @entity5 media , which is abuzz with the story , revealed the @entity71 ' @entity12 comments , including this one , in which they criticized @entity5 's air , water , traffic , health conditions and even the @entity5 diet offensive : ' @entity109 definitely weighs more than ( the gardener )			1
a bit more protein in @entity109 's diet , ' mrs may wrote ' i would underscore that these do not in any way represent the @entity4 government position , ' a @entity115 spokeswoman said			2
@entity13 , who was in the @entity4 embassy 's security department , and his wife were identified by @entity5 media as the @entity4 couple who were expelled in retaliation for the expulsion of @entity126 , after her arrest last month on charges she kept her @entity5 domestic worker in virtual servitude			1
@entity126 , 39 , a women 's - rights champion who served as deputy consul general for political , economic , commercial and women 's affairs at the @entity5 consulate in @entity16 , was indicted for lying on official documents that claimed she was paying her female housekeeper $ 4,500 a month			1
in reality , the feds say , @entity126 forced @entity5 national @entity143 to work 100 or more hours a week , with no days off , for just $ 573 a month			2
she was granted diplomatic immunity and on tuesday filed papers in @entity147 federal court to get the indictment tossed so she can come back to the @entity4 to be with her husband , @entity151 , who teaches philosophy at the @entity153 in @entity154 , and their two young daughters			0
distance : the @entity115 was quick to distance itself from the horrid comments @entity5 asked the @entity4 on friday to withdraw @entity13 from the @entity157 in @entity55 , the latest retaliation in a smoldering diplomatic dispute touched off by the arrest and strip search of an @entity5 diplomat in @entity16			1
the case has caused a serious rift between the @entity4 and @entity5 , where officials have described the treatment of @entity126 , @entity5 's deputy consul general in @entity16 , as barbaric			1
@entity126 , a 39 - year - old mother of two , is accused of exploiting her @entity5 - born housekeeper and nanny , allegedly having her work more than 100 hours a week for low pay and lying about it on a visa form			2
@entity126 has maintained her innocence			0
friday 's demand by @entity5 's @entity175 came just hours after the two sides appeared to have struck a compromise of sorts : @entity126 was indicted by a @entity4 federal grand jury in @entity147 , but also granted immunity that allowed her to leave the country			1
she was on a flight to @entity5 on friday , and many believed that would be enough to give both countries a way to save face			0
given their strategic bilateral partnership and more than $ 100 billion in trade , any further escalation in the case would not be in the interest of either country , analysts said			0
but on friday evening , the @entity175 said an unidentified @entity4 diplomat of the same rank as @entity126 was somehow involved in the case and should leave the country , the @entity196 news agency reported			2
requesting the recall of a diplomat is a serious , and fairly unusual , move that sends a message to @entity205 that @entity5 's government does n't accept the legitimacy of the court action in @entity16			2
much of the outrage over the case in @entity5 stems from the circumstances of @entity126 's arrest , which were seen as unnecessarily humiliating			2
@entity126 was picked up mid december and then strip - searched while in custody , which the @entity214 say is common practice .			0

@entity13 and his wife @entity217 were effectively deported last week by @entity5 authorities
the move was apparently in retaliation for the @entity4 expulsion of @entity5 envoy @entity126 in december
but the outrageous comments have only just come to light - and the couple 's *respective* social media pages are awash with them
mrs may wrote on @entity12 that @entity5 vegetarians were responsible for a wave of violence : ' applies only to @entity5 , not westerners ! ' she added
she also put up a picture of a cow , sacred in @entity5 , with the label ' stupid cow ' then admitted insulting @entity58 , saying ' not the first time , not the last ! '
