@entity0 of @entity1 looked every inch the yummy mummy as she visited a @entity5 primary school today but had some competition in the style stakes in the shape of @entity10 - winning artist @entity9			1
resplendent in a £ 450 loose fitting navy dress by @entity12 that showed a hint of baby bump , the @entity0 was all smiles as she arrived at @entity16 in @entity5			1
@entity9 , meanwhile , wore a typically daring short black dress that he had designed himself and showed off a pair of legs that were almost as enviable as @entity20 's own			1
@entity20 looked blooming gorgeous again today in a chic and sophisticated shift dress by upscale label @entity12 and while it does have a regular ready - to - wear line this brand is best known for its luxury maternity wear			1
launched in 2012 @entity12 uses prints , trims and embellishments as well as premium fabric enabling pregnant women be stylish even when they 're expecting			0
and @entity20 is n't the only royal fan of the label 's high end designs			1
@entity53 famously wore one of their dresses while she was pregnant with daughter @entity57			0
we love this ' @entity31 ' shift on the @entity60			0
the a-line cut skims her slender frame but is roomy enough to accommodate her baby bump			2
the navy wool is trimmed with feminine @entity30 tweed in pastel pink and the gold buttons add a dash of grown up glamour			0

@entity81 shift dress at @entity82 visit site @entity85 shift dress ( now reduced to $ 230 ) visit site @entity88 navy boucle @entity90 dress visit site @entity93 contrast trim shift dress at @entity94 visit site the duo were at the school to officially name a new art studio on behalf of art therapy charity , @entity99 , and the @entity0 was given some art of her own to take home			1
as she chatted to @entity9 outside the school , a pair of pupils approached with a pint - sized printed chair in their hands , presumably made with @entity107 in mind , and presented it to the @entity0			1
a clearly delighted @entity20 , who was making her first public appearance since christmas day , then bent down to pick up the artwork and thank the children who made it			2
@entity0 , who is six months pregnant , showed a hint of baby bump beneath her £ 450 ‘ @entity31 ’ shift dress , which is still available to buy although the company ’s website has already crashed to unprecedented public interest			1
@entity20 is not the first royal to have worn the brand while expecting – prince @entity123 ’s cousin , @entity53 , also favoured it when pregnant with her daughter , @entity57 all parts of the dress are @entity128 made , including the fabric from @entity132 textile mill @entity130 , who describe it as ‘ doeskin ’ , which mimics the appearance and feel of the skin of a female deer			1
by contrast , @entity9 said he had made his dress himself and declared the over-the - top black cocktail number with voluminous net underskirts to be his ‘ ladies who lunch ’ outfit			1
‘ i thought it was appropriate for the occasion , ’ said the married father - of - one , who also wore black heels like the @entity0 but with sheer , instead of opaque , tights			1
although the duchess got top marks for style , her hair was much less easy to manipulate and whipped around her head on several occasions thanks to strong winds hint of a bump : a tiny baby bump could be seen beneath the @entity60 ' dress			1
she is due to give birth to her second child in april busy week : @entity0 has a further engagement to complete this week and will complete another one on monday speaking about the @entity0 , he commented : ' if she goes somewhere the media will follow			2
' it 's up to her to use that to shine a laser beam upon the organisation with which she is working , it 's her job			0
and she wields it with enormous grace as far as i can see			0
' the @entity179 prize - winning artist also described @entity20 , who has a series of royal engagements over the coming days , as ' looking pretty chic for six months '			1
the new @entity183 art studio , which the @entity0 officially named today , will be run by @entity99 , a charity of which both the @entity0 and @entity9 are patrons , which provides art therapy for underprivileged children			1
85 children all aged between five and 11 , will receive art sessions designed to provide them with self - confidence , self - esteem and independence in the new studio each week			2
inside the new art room the @entity0 met with a group of eight children and asked them about their paintings			1
at one point one little boy said to her : ‘ you would like to be a chicken ’ to which she laughed and replied : ‘ i would like to be a chicken ? ‘ maybe , actually ! ’ she also took part in a round table discussion with charity founder @entity205 and fellow patron @entity9			2
speaking during the discussion , @entity9 said : ‘ this is a normalised version of what i found out for myself , which is that an art practice is where you can go to soothe yourself			2
‘ a day like today makes everyone feel special that it 's being taken seriously			0
often people regard art as a kind of add - on			2
certainly the recent education minister - mentioning no names @entity222 - seemed to think art was this thing you could somehow elbow off the curriculum			2
‘ yes , it 's a huge part of @entity128 and an essential part of life			0
we should n't think it 's just something for posh people			0
that 's why i identify so much with the @entity99 because i come from that sort of background , a working class background			0
' first outing : this is the first time the @entity0 has been seen in public since attending church with the rest of the royals on @entity242 joining forces : @entity0 of @entity1 and @entity9 , who was resplendent in black , are both patrons of @entity245 is that for me ? two of the children , supervised by @entity9 , present the @entity20 with a collage - covered chair delighted : the royal mother - to - be looked absolutely thrilled as the children presented her with the handmade gift the room is named after the @entity257 which has been making donations to @entity245 since 2005 and will cover the running costs for the new space over the next three years			1
@entity0 had planned to officially open the facility last autumn but was forced to cancel the engagement after developing hyperemesis gravidarum , a severe form of morning sickness			2
although the space is now open , it was yet to be officially named - a function the @entity0 completed during today 's event , as well as speaking to staff and children who have benefited from @entity245 workshops already			2
as @entity20 left the school after her hour - long engagement she was greeted by 250 flag - waving children - each of whom had drawn a portrait of the the @entity0 on the back			1
the royal looked delighted and stopped to speak to several of the cheering youngsters before getting into her official car			0
@entity283 said the engagement reflects the @entity60 ’s interest in the arts and her keenness on the concept of using the creativity of art to enrich the lives of young people			0
chair to the throne ! @entity0 looked thoroughly impressed with the gift made for her by the @entity26 primary school pupils supporter : like the @entity60 , the artist is a long - term supporter of @entity245 , a charity that provides art therapy to children big day : after being presented with a pint - sized chair , the @entity0 went to speak with other pupils - some of whom looked a little bashful a spokesman for the @entity99 explained that there are many reasons why children are referred to their practitioners and why they need time away from their mainstream classrooms			1
some might be youngsters suffering bereavements , family breakdown or a chaotic home life , while others could be living with violence or abuse			0
among them are also children on the autistic spectrum and others recently arrived in the @entity128			0
according to the charity , children are encouraged to open up about anxieties as they paint in the hopes that they will ultimately learn to cope with the difficulties they face			0
referrals can comes from teachers , parents and social workers or other adults involved in their lives			0
speaking ahead of the @entity60 ' arrival , one year 5 child , who wishes to remain anonymous , said : ' i look forward to visiting @entity245			0
it ’s like having thinking space			0
painting makes me feel good and i feel in a better mood afterwards			0
' head teacher @entity344 added : ‘ it is extremely exciting to be able to host hrh @entity0 of @entity1 as we can proudly introduce her to our children and show the school and our ethos			1
‘ since opening @entity245 in october , we have been overwhelmed with the positive benefits it has brought to the children			0
@entity353 to meet you : many of the children are among those being given art therapy by @entity245 , of which the @entity0 is patron warm welcome : @entity0 of @entity1 was cheered as she went to leave by a crowd of excited children fresh - faced : @entity0 , who looked rosy - cheeked and on good form , was clearly benefiting from a pregnancy glow stopping to chat : @entity0 , who was accompanied by her close protection team , insisted on stopping and was given a bunch of flowers all smiles : @entity0 smiled broadly as she chatted to young well - wishers outside the school in @entity26 scrum : standing opposite the children was a horde of photographers , eager to get the perfect shot of the @entity0			1

@entity0 of @entity1 was at @entity16 in @entity26 to name an art room

@entity10 - winning artist @entity9 joined the 33 - year - old royal for the naming *ceremony*
