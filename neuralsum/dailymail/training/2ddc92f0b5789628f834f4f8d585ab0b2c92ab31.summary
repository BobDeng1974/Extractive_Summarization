when great - grandmother @entity1 asked the man behind the counter at her local shop to check her @entity6 ticket , he told her she had won nothing			1
@entity8 , however , was being somewhat economical with the truth			2
for the ticket was actually a £ 1million jackpot winner			1
in for the win : @entity1 , 77 , and husband @entity13 could not believe that ' @entity14 ' had tried to dupe them and they could be millionaires after lying to the 77 - year - old , he asked : ‘ do you want me to throw the ticket away ? ’ and mrs @entity1 replied : ‘ well , if there ’s nothing on it you may as well			1
’ @entity8 , 30 , later phoned the lottery hotline and tried to claim the fortune for himself , claiming he had bought the ticket at the @entity27 shop			1
he boasted about his amazing win to the managers of the shop and said the win was ‘ life - changing ’			2
he claimed he had already drawn up a shopping list			2
but @entity33 questioned @entity8 after discovering the winning lottery ticket had actually been bought at a nearby supermarket in @entity36			1
realising he was not the genuine winner , investigators called in the police before launching a hunt for the legitimate owner			2
luckily , they were able to trace mrs @entity1 because she had used her @entity42 when she bought the ticket , and the store had her contact details			1
@entity47 footage also confirmed she had bought it and yesterday @entity33 was able to confirm mrs @entity1 and her husband were the rightful winners			1
caught out : @entity8 told @entity1 that her prize ticket was worthless and then started planning what he would spend her winnings on the mother of seven , whose husband @entity13 , 80 , still works for a security firm , said : ‘ i just ca n’t believe he did this , but at least he got caught			1
this money will mean my husband can finally give up work and we can enjoy our retirement			1
’ @entity8 , of @entity63 , went on the run when he realised his deceit had been exposed , telling his bosses he was going away on a long holiday			2
he was eventually arrested by police and appeared before @entity69 this week , where he admitted fraud by false representation			2
he will be sentenced on august 20			2
the couple had known @entity8 – who they knew as @entity14 – for about a year and considered the shop worker trustworthy and friendly			1
mrs @entity1 said : ‘ i thought he was a nice young man			2
he knew me and my husband by name			1
everyone calls him lucky but he was n’t very lucky this time			2
’ she said they had been on holiday when the @entity6 draw was made on june 22			0
on their return from @entity82 mrs @entity1 went into the @entity27 convenience store and asked @entity8 to check the numbers for her			0
she explained : ‘ he said “ do you want me to throw it away ? ” and i said “ well , if there ’s nothing on it you may as well ”			0
‘ then a few days later a lady from @entity33 knocked on the door and asked about the ticket			1
she said there ’s a possibility a winning ticket has been presented that ’s yours			1
i could n’t believe it			0
’ the couple , who have seven grandchildren and two great - grandchildren , said they have been so upset by the investigation that they have n’t been able to sleep			1
mr @entity104 said : ‘ it ’s kept us awake at night			0
i was really terribly shocked when i found out what happened			0
’ furious : @entity110 29 , boss of the convenience store where mrs @entity1 was tricked , says he thought ' something was not right ' when @entity8 said he had won the lottery the couple aim to buy a new car , make some improvements to their small terraced house in @entity36 , and spoil their large family			1
mrs @entity1 said : ' it 's such a relief that it 's over			0
it 's still all a bit surreal			0
' mr @entity104 added : ' i officially retired 15 years ago but i 've still been working but i 'm only doing two days a week because they said i should wind down			0
but i 'm going to give up work now			0
it 's just a dream			0
' the owners of the shop , brothers @entity129 , 42 , and @entity131 , 29 , said they were furious at the betrayal of their customers			0
mr @entity131 said : ‘ he was talking about buying cars and all sorts			0
but something did n’t sound right			0
eventually we sat him down and said if that ticket is n’t yours you are in trouble			1
he swore on the @entity141 and on his mum and dad ’s life it was his ticket			1
’ mr @entity129 and mr @entity131 said they would now look at improving staff training and cctv coverage			0
mr @entity129 said : ' i feel absolutely gutted			0
especially because it 's happened to @entity13 and @entity1 - we 've known them for years			0
' they are some of the nicest people you will ever meet			0
' @entity33 said it had rigorous security checks in place to ensure the identity of legitimate ticket holders .			1
