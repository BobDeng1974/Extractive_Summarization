by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter the @entity0 has accused the @entity3 of a ' massive and unprecedented intrusion ' after it secretly obtained two months worth of reporters ' telephone records , potentially identifying confidential sources			1
the records listed journalists ' incoming and outgoing calls , as well as the duration of each call , for the work and personal phone numbers of individual reporters , general @entity0 office numbers in @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 , @entity20 , and the main number for @entity0 reporters in the @entity24 press gallery , according to attorneys for the @entity0 in all , the government seized records for more than 20 separate telephone lines assigned to @entity0 and its journalists in april and may of 2012			1
the government would not say why it sought the records			1
news of the probe into one of the largest news organizations in the world immediately sparked outrage among @entity37 on @entity38			0
' @entity42 is first for a reason , ' @entity39 , spokesman for @entity41 speaker @entity40 , told @entity44			0
' if the @entity46 is going after reporters â€™ phone records , they better have a damned good explanation			2
' justice : the @entity0 has accused the @entity3 of a ' massive and unprecedented intrusion ' after it secretly obtained two months worth of reporters ' telephone records , potentially identifying confidential sources a spokesman for @entity41 majority leader @entity56 , a @entity37 in @entity57 , said the move is representative of a broader ' pattern of intimidation			1
' ' whether it is secretly targeting patriotic @entity65 participating in the electoral progress or reporters exercising their first amendment rights , these new revelations suggest a pattern of intimidation by the @entity46 , ' @entity62 said			0
the @entity71 was equally critical			0
' obtaining a broad range of telephone records in order to ferret out a government leaker is an unacceptable abuse of power , ' said @entity77 , director of the @entity79 , @entity80 , and @entity81			1
' @entity82 is a pillar of our democracy , and that freedom often depends on confidential communications between reporters and their sources			0
' @entity41 spokesman @entity89 initially declined a request for comment on this story and referred all further inquiries to the @entity3			2
a couple hours later he released a statement saying , ' other than press reports , we have no knowledge of any attempt by the @entity3 to seek phone records of the @entity0 we are not involved in decisions made in connection with criminal investigations , as those matters are handled independently by the @entity3			1
' ' any questions about an ongoing criminal investigation should be directed to the @entity3 , ' the statement added			2
@entity0 president and chief executive officer @entity107 said the government obtained information far beyond anything that could be justified by any specific investigation			1
he demanded the return of the phone records and destruction of all copies			2
' there can be no possible justification for such an overbroad collection of the telephone communications of @entity0 and its reporters , ' @entity107 wrote in a letter of protest to attorney general @entity124			1
' these records potentially reveal communications with confidential sources across all of the newsgathering activities undertaken by the @entity0 during a two - month period , provide a road map to @entity0 's newsgathering operations , and disclose information about @entity0 's activities and operations that the government has no conceivable right to know			1
' the exact number of journalists who used the phone lines during that period is unknown but more than 100 journalists work in the offices whose phone records were targeted on a wide array of stories about government and other matters			1
@entity65 officials have previously said in public testimony that the @entity65 attorney in @entity18 is conducting a criminal investigation into who may have leaked information contained in a may 7 , 2012 , @entity0 story about a foiled terror plot			1
outraged : @entity0 president and chief executive officer @entity107 , pictured , said the government sought and obtained information far beyond anything that could be justified by any specific investigation the story disclosed details of a @entity164 operation in @entity165 that stopped an @entity167 plot in the spring of 2012 to detonate a bomb on an airplane bound for the @entity65			1
in testimony in february , cia director @entity170 noted that the @entity172 had questioned him about whether he was @entity0 's source , which he denied			2
he called the release of the information to the media about the terror plot an ' unauthorized and dangerous disclosure of classified information			0
' prosecutors have sought phone records from reporters before , but the seizure of records from such a wide array of @entity0 offices , including general @entity0 switchboards numbers and an office - wide shared fax line , is unusual and largely unprecedented			1
in the letter notifying the @entity0 received friday , the @entity3 offered no explanation for the seizure , according to @entity107 's letter and attorneys for the @entity0 the records were presumably obtained from phone companies earlier this year although the government letter did not explain that			1
none of the information provided by the government to the @entity0 suggested the actual phone conversations were monitored			1
the @entity3 released a statement on monday defending its actions			2
' we take seriously our obligations to follow all applicable laws , federal regulations , and @entity3 policies when issuing subpoenas for phone records of media organizations , ' the statement reads			2
' those regulations require us to make every reasonable effort to obtain information through alternative means before even considering a subpoena for the phone records of a member of the media			0
' ' because we value the freedom of the press , we are always careful and deliberative in seeking to strike the right balance between the public interest in the free flow of information and the public interest in the fair and effective administration of our criminal laws			0
' among those whose phone numbers were obtained were five reporters and an editor who were involved in the may 7 , 2012 story			1
the @entity237 administration has aggressively investigated disclosures of classified information to the media and has brought six cases against people suspected of leaking classified information , more than under all previous presidents combined			0
@entity3 published rules require that subpoenas of records from news organizations must be personally approved by the attorney general but it was not known if that happened in this case			1
the letter notifying @entity0 that its phone records had been obtained though subpoenas was sent friday by @entity254 , the @entity65 attorney in @entity18			1
spokesmen in @entity254 's office and at the @entity3 had no immediate comment on monday			0
records : in all , the government seized records for more than 20 separate telephone lines assigned to @entity0 and its journalists in april and may of 2012			1
the government would not say why it sought the records ( stock photo ) the @entity3 lays out strict rules for efforts to get phone records from news organizations			1
a subpoena can only be considered after ' all reasonable attempts ' have been made to get the same information from other sources , the rules say			0
it was unclear what other steps , in total , the @entity3 has taken to get information in the case			0
a subpoena to the media must be ' as narrowly drawn as possible ' and ' should be directed at relevant information regarding a limited subject matter and should cover a reasonably limited time period , ' according to the rules			0
the reason for these constraints , the department says , is to avoid actions that ' might impair the news gathering function ' because the government recognizes that ' @entity82 can be no broader than the freedom of reporters to investigate and report the news			0
' news organizations normally are notified in advance that the government wants phone records and enter into negotiations over the desired information			0
in this case , however , the government , in its letter to the @entity0 , cited an exemption to those rules that holds that prior notification can be waived if such notice , in the exemption 's wording , might ' pose a substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation			2
' intrusion : the @entity0 has sent a letter of protest to attorney general @entity124 , pictured it is unknown whether a judge or a grand jury signed off on the subpoenas			1
the may 7 , 2012 , @entity0 story that disclosed details of the @entity164 operation in @entity165 to stop an airliner bomb plot occurred around the one - year anniversary of the may 2 , 2011 , killing of @entity323			2
the plot was significant because the @entity41 had told the public it had ' no credible information that terrorist organizations , including @entity167 , are plotting attacks in the @entity65 to coincide with the ( may 2 ) anniversary of @entity323 's death			0
' the @entity0 delayed reporting the story at the request of government officials who said it would jeopardize national security			2
once government officials said those concerns were allayed , the @entity0 disclosed the plot because officials said it no longer endangered national security			2
the @entity237 administration , however , continued to request that the story be held until the administration could make an official announcement			0
the may 7 story was written by reporters @entity345 and @entity347 with contributions from reporters @entity349 , @entity351 and @entity352			0
they and their editor , @entity354 , were among the journalists whose april - may 2012 phone records were seized by the government			1
@entity170 talked about the @entity0 story and leaks investigation in written testimony to the @entity361			0
' the irresponsible and damaging leak of classified information was made ... when someone informed the @entity0 that the @entity365 had intercepted an @entity367 ( improvised explosive device ) that was supposed to be used in an attack and that the @entity365 currently had that @entity367 in its possession and was analyzing it , ' he said			0
he also defended the @entity41 's plan to discuss the plot immediately afterward			0
' once someone leaked information about interdiction of the @entity367 and that the @entity367 was actually in our possession , it was imperative to inform the @entity65 people consistent with @entity365 policy that there was never any danger to the @entity65 people associated with this @entity167 plot , ' @entity170 told senators .			0

@entity3 *allegedly* obtained records listing incoming and outgoing calls and duration of calls for more than 20 telephone lines used by journalists
lines included the main number used by reporters in the @entity397 press gallery and general @entity0 numbers in @entity18 and @entity17
the government would not say why it sought the records , from april and may 2012
@entity0 president @entity107 has demanded the records be returned or destroyed claiming : ' there can be no possible justification ' for such an intrusion
