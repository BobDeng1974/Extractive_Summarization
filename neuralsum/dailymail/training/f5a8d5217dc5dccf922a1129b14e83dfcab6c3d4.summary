by @entity0 for @entity1 campaigners say just one seahorse has been spotted this year in what used to be @entity6 's largest colony after pleasure boats churned up the animals ' habitat			1
@entity10 , @entity11 , was the only @entity12 site where both the spiny and short - snouted species were known to breed in recent years and a survey found more than 40 seahorses in 2008			1
but activists say the number has dwindled , and an 80 - hour survey lasting several weeks this summer found no seahorses at all			1
alone : this spiny seahorse was the only one spotted this year in @entity11 's @entity10 , which used to be the largest breeding colony in @entity6 , according to the @entity24			1
it wants more restrictions on boat owners beauty spot : @entity10 attracts boat owners throughout the summer - but they deny they are responsible the @entity24 , which has long campaigned unsuccessfully for @entity10 to become a @entity30 , has been notified of just one sighting all year			1
the lone spiny seahorse was spotted last month off @entity10 's @entity33 , near the @entity24 's study area , by underwater cameraman @entity35 in a 20 - hour search			1
mr @entity35 , who films documentary footage for his firm @entity39 , told @entity1 : ' i 've wanted to film a seahorse for a number of years and i spent 20 hours of diving time looking for one			0
' i had about an hour following it - it was incredible			2
' they 're so camouflaged			0
this one was coiled up with the texture of its back matching the seaweed behind it			0
' the campaigners say eelgrass in the bay 's shallow waters , which provides a crucial habitat for the creatures , is being destroyed by the anchors of yachts and pleasure boats			1
underwater cameraman @entity35 said : ' i had about an hour following it - it was incredible ' on one sunny day in july , as many as 350 boats were recorded in the bay - and when the tide goes out , they end up resting on the fragile seaweed			1
mr @entity35 admitted that with the seahorses ' power of camouflage , there may be more hidden in the bay which have not been spotted			1
and boat owners have attacked @entity74 's claims , insisting they are not responsible and saying the figures are being spun to put unnecessary restrictions on them			1
but mr @entity35 insisted : ' something 's definitely changed			0
there were lots of sightings in 2009 and 2010 and they were n't so hard to find			0
people could see two or three on one dive			0
' i 've seen and filmed the anchor damage myself and seen what it does to the eelgrass			2
' whether it 's a natural cycle and they 'll return again , i do n't know , but when you see the damage done by anchors it 's a no - brainer - that must be stopped			2
' you would n't have to get rid of the boats			0
it 's just a case of putting in moorings that do n't damage the seabed			0
' five years ago marine experts recorded 40 individual spiny seahorses at @entity10 and one pair of the short - snouted species			1
since then the @entity24 says numbers have fallen steadily , with only four spiny seahorses spotted in 2013 and no short - snouted animals			1
the male found by mr @entity35 was believed to be a juvenile			2
young seahorses are transient , which means the one pictured may not have been resident to @entity10			2
conservationists are warning that unless urgent action is taken to protect their habitat , seahorses will be lost forever at @entity10			1
@entity11 - based marine conservationist @entity114 said : ' this summer divers have searched @entity10 two or three times a day for two or three hours a time			1
rare find : the animals are masters of camouflage , and can change colour to match the seaweed around them ' both myself and @entity35 have carried out thorough searches on the site and others have also been looking for these animals and this is still the only one seen in 2014			2
' we need to protect this site before it is too late and we lose them forever			0
' @entity24 director @entity131 added : ' @entity10 is or was the most important colony for seahorses in the @entity6 and now that colony has all but gone			2
' the whole thing is incredibly saddening			0
our warnings about the habitat destruction have n’t been heeded by people in authority			2
i hate to say it but these statistics prove we were right			0
' but i am an optimist and i believe if we can get @entity30 status the area might recover and seahorses might start to come back again in numbers			2
' spiny seahorses are named after the prickly , fleshy spines which arch down the length of their necks and can change colour to blend in with plants on the sea bed			1
their latin namehippocampus histrix , the animals breed in coastal waters during the summer months and have been sighted off various points on the @entity12 coast			0
it is the males who become pregnant and give birth , and they have been known to produce broods of more than 500 young			0
the animals hunt by waiting in until prey swims close to their snouts , which then suck in a sharp intake of water including the day 's meal			0
@entity175 pair for life and even after they have mated for the first time , they perform elaborate courting displays lasting up to an hour			0
sources : @entity180 nature / @entity24 @entity10 has been recommended for @entity30 status and the government 's @entity182 ( @entity182 ) is considering the bid			2
the move would force boat owners to use environmentally - friendly mooring buoys which ensure they do not have to anchor or lie flat on the sea bed			1
@entity189 , a spokesman for the @entity190 , denied his members were destroying the eelgrass			0
' @entity10 has been used by generations of boat owners , going back the last 70 years and eelgrass has always been there , ' he said			1
' why is there suddenly an issue now ? ' there is a huge body of evidence from worldwide research that states that this type of eel grass is very resilient and if damaged it puts on a growth spurt to recover			0
' it is wrong to say that boat owners are causing long term damage to it			1
there are unusual holes in the eel grass but there are also the same holes in the eel grass outside of the anchoring area so how do you explain that			0
' he added @entity10 was used more in 2008 than it is now and there could be manifold reasons why the animals ' numbers had declined			1
a @entity182 spokesman said : ' we are doing more than ever to protect our marine environment , with 27 @entity227 designated last year and a further two more phases of designation expected over the next few years			0
' we already have over 500 @entity230 in @entity6 waters and just under 25 per cent of @entity233 inshore waters are already within @entity234			0

@entity10 in @entity11 had more than 40 spiny seahorses in a 2008 survey
but numbers have fallen , and an 80 - hour survey this year found none at all
campaigners say they know of just one spotted in the bay so far this year
they say anchors destroy eelgrass which forms the seahorses ' habitat
boat owners deny claim , saying it is a *mystery* why animals have declined
