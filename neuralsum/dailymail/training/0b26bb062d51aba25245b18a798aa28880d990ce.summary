by @entity0 a desperate jobseeker who applied for 15,000 jobs with no success in the past ten years has resorted to advertising himself by wearing a ' hire me ' sandwich board			1
@entity6 , from @entity7 , has a masters degree in history and several @entity10 but has been overlooked by an endless slew of employers			1
he has now taken drastic action , spending an entire day wearing a sign reading ' hire me please ' and walking up and down the @entity17 slip - road at @entity18 in @entity19			1
extreme move : @entity6 stood by the motorway wearing a sandwich board for a day in the hope of finding employment mr @entity6 said : ' i have applied for around 25 jobs a week for the past ten years without getting anywhere			1
' sometimes i have applied for as many as 50 in one week			0
it is never - ending			2
' i barely even get a response either , even just an email to say they had received my application but have not been accepted			0
' i am looking for any full - time work - i ’m not picky			2
' mr @entity6 , who worked for the @entity34 for seven years , was a self - employed footcare technician until 2002 when his business went under			1
since then he has had odd - jobs including cleaning , gardening and building work , but craves the stability of full - time employment			2
reaching his limits : mr @entity6 has a masters degree in history and several @entity10 but has been overlooked by employers he said : ' things were bad before but have become worse since the recession			1
now i do n’t think there is any chance of me getting work			0
' it is partly down to the recession but also my age			0
companies do n’t want to hire anybody in their 40s			2
all the jobs go to the young up - and - coming jobseekers			2
' i ’ve got the qualifications but i ca n’t get the work			0
as soon as they see how old you are , they do n’t want to know			0
' it ’s against the law to be ageist but in the real world , my world here today , it ’s still here and it ’s wrong			0
' despite all his efforts , mr @entity6 has had no job offers - and only a handful of interviews - and he said hitting rock - bottom convinced him to try a new tactic			1
' wearing the sign is a last - ditch attempt for me to get work , a real last resort			1
i spent a couple of months working up the guts to go down and do it			0
' it was not an easy step but things have become that desperate for me			0
i feel physically sick having to stoop to this but i have no other choice			0
' it can work ! @entity92 found a job after advertising his skills on a sandwich board beside the @entity96 mr @entity6 has set up an email address - hire - me - pleeaase@hotmail.co.uk ( sic ) - so potential employers can get in touch			1
latest statistics show unemployment in the @entity102 now stands at 2.63million , falling by 45,000 in the three months to march this year			2
mr @entity6 is not the first recession - hit jobseeker to try such dramatic measures after struggling to find work			1
earlier this month , unemployed @entity107 , from @entity108 , put his face on an electric billboard with the words : ' @entity112 ! ' he shelled out $ 300 for his face to rotate with other adverts for 24 hours			0
last year , frustrated @entity115 jobseeker @entity114 , from @entity116 , walked around the city centre wearing a sandwich board saying ' hire me ! ' on one side and ' college grad ' on the other			1
but the strategy did work for one lucky @entity124 , who managed to impress would - be employers with his spirit and dedication			1
