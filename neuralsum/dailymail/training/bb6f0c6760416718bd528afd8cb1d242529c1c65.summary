a new flagship ' free school ' is planning to replace teachers with computers for some day - to - day lessons , it was claimed today			1
one of @entity7 ’s biggest academy chains - @entity6 - wants to set up a new ' blended learning ' model – which will see children taught over the internet for large chunks of the day			1
the new ' e-school ' will be known as the @entity13 and is due to open in @entity14 from september 2016 as part of the government ’s free schools scheme , according to the teaching journal the @entity19			1
under a new ' blended learning ' model pioneered in the @entity21 children could be taught by computers for around a quarter of the school day charter schools in the @entity21 - which were an inspiration for the education secretary @entity27 's free schools programme - have already tried and tested similar radical schemes with some success			1
one called @entity30 pioneered the model and now operates nine schools in @entity33 and @entity34 , teaching 5,000 pupils who spend a quarter of their school day online			1
rocketship chief executive @entity37 said that computers had allowed his organisation to ' really rethink the school day '			0
' we have fewer teachers than a traditional school serving the same number of students			2
' by slashing the number of staff , the school can plough the savings into the remaining teachers ' salaries - therefore better teachers			1
education secretary @entity27 has introduced ' free schools ' which give headteachers wide - ranging powers to change the way children are taught mr @entity37 said this allowed him to pay teachers up to 50 per cent more than nearby schools			1
he added that he wanted teachers earning more than $ 100,000 ' as quickly as possible ' mr @entity37 said : ' if your kids are performing incredibly well , and you have eliminated the achievement gap in your classroom , and your kids are on a par with the most affluent kids in the country , we should be paying you incredibly well because you are doing amazing work			0
' we want to help you realise six figures , if not more , as quickly as possible			0
' but @entity73 , of the teaching union the @entity75 , said : ' the use of the word " efficiencies " is all very nice but what it really means is cuts			0
' if we have got circumstances where we have got children ostensibly being taught , but actually sitting in front of computers for a significant amount of time and not having routine access to a teacher for every lesson , then that would be a completely wrong departure			2
' we would be concerned about the loss of teaching jobs and about the loss of proper good quality education for all children and young people			0
' @entity98 has said it hopes that by using computers it will ' increase the reach of great teachers '			0
documents given to the @entity19 reveal how @entity98 believes the new model will allow teachers ' roles to be ' revised '			2
other schools using the system have introduced new roles that include ' master teachers ' responsible for ' leading full - class or small group instruction ' while the computers take on more of the routine tasks			0
teachers in the new computer schools could also be responsible for ' leading small group instruction ' or the ' supervision of online learning '			2
an @entity98 spokesman today said : ' our plans are at a very early stage , but it is worth reflecting that our blended learning pilot at @entity124 did not mean fewer teachers or bigger classes , but ensuring that pupils have access to the latest in educational technology and techniques			1
' the school is rated outstanding by @entity132 and results have been improving every year , above national averages			0
high quality teaching is at the core of the @entity98 approach , and helps our schools to achieve excellent standards			0

@entity14 ' @entity13 ' set to trial new ' blended learning ' model
