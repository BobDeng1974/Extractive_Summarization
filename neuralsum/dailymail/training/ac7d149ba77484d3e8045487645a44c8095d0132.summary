by @entity0 published : 11:13 est , 1 august 2013 updated : 11:13 est , 1 august 2013 exhausted : since the birth of her first child just weeks ago , @entity0 says she feels like she has aged 10 years - and does n't recognise the bleary - eyed woman in the mirror let ’s face it , not everyone is comfortable with injecting a toxin into their face			1
and for pregnant and breastfeeding women particularly - it is most definitely not on the menu			1
when new mother @entity15 first came home with baby @entity17 , there were rumours that she had elected not to breastfeed , in order to get back to her beloved @entity22 injections sooner rather than later			1
however , she was subsequently said to have changed her mind			0
maybe she found out about @entity22			1
a term once used to describe miniscule but strategic amounts of @entity22 carefully applied and with great restraint , @entity22 has taken on a whole new meaning amongst the yummy mummy set			1
indeed it ’s becoming increasingly popular for pregnant women and the new , and often breastfeeding mother determined that her face not look as tired as she feels			1
and while ‘ @entity36 ’ face treatments have been around for a while , the market for mums is booming with brand new and innumerable options to keep you looking your best during this challenging and constantly exhausting time of your life			2
most of us realise that having a baby affects not only your body , but also has a major impact on your face			2
i can vividly recall waking up shortly after my daughter was born and thinking ‘ who in the world is she ? ’ as i stared at my bleary eyed , slack - jawed face after a 3am feed			1
i had aged a decade it seemed , in the space of a few weeks			0
early mornings , late night feeds , the stress of making sure that the baby ’s taken care of properly combined with a general lack of sleep can lead to a look of perpetual weariness that i suspect all new mothers are familiar with			2
as more sleep was not an immediate possibility , i began my research into what actually could be done			0
to be sure , there are lots of options out there : i tried and liked @entity74 , ( bee venom ) , @entity76 , ( peptide gel ) , dr @entity79 ’s @entity78 ( natural enzymes ) , and @entity81 ( snail secretions )			2
all good choices and worth exploring			0
owever what i discovered is , at the moment , the term most buzzed about amongst beauty editors – and indeed at @entity87 and @entity88 around the nation - is ‘ @entity90 ’			1
created by skincare guru @entity91 and voted ‘ the best alternative to @entity22 ’ by @entity92 , @entity90 is quite simply , the @entity94			1
@entity36 ? it was rumoured @entity15 elected not to breastfeed so she could take up @entity22 injections again after her baby 's birth - but she is said to have subsequently changed her mind			1
right , @entity100 has visited the @entity91 clinic and @entity102 is said to be a fan of @entity91 's oxygen facials it contains neuro - peptides and natural algae which surround the muscles with proteins to block the skin contracting			1
says @entity91 , ' researching through the thousands of ingredients available , i found that the most effective botanical was @entity114			1
combined with other natural ingredients , the skin will appear more youthful and relaxing without looking frozen in time			0
' a toxin - free treatment with staying power , @entity90 works by gently helping the skin avoid conforming to expression lines when the muscles contract			1
the key words here are ‘ gently ’ and ‘ natural ’			0
it ’s like @entity22 without the poison or freeze			2
sold online as a stand alone lotion , or as part of a professional facial treatment , @entity90 is hugely popular amongst the women who frequent @entity91 ’s @entity137 salon - whether pregnant , breastfeeding , or just looking for smoother skin in a natural way			1
' @entity22 is a registered trademark of @entity138 a @entity140 based company			2
it is used to freeze certain muscles in the face to reduce expression and age lines			0
the @entity146 alternative is called @entity90 that uses algae derivatives to relax the skin			1
our product was designed for those clients who did not want to have a toxin injected into the skin as well as for women who are pregnant and should refrain throughout their pregnancy			0
it is a more effective treatment for those with deeper frown lines no matter what age			0
the @entity161 treatment is carried out and then the v - tox is added to specific areas that need to be treated or a fine layer can be applied generally over the entire face and neck			1
the product is then infused into the skin by the steady flow of oxygen			0
' - @entity91 a skin care expert for more than 40 years , @entity91 developed @entity90 after a storied career of taking care of some of the world ’s most beautiful and famous faces			1
@entity102 , @entity100 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180 have all been clients			1
@entity91 says , ' unsurprisingly , staying young and beautiful for as long as possible is on every woman ’s wish list			2
medical professionals continue to develop treatments deemed ‘ cosmetic , ’ some of which are certainly beneficial , but others put pressure on women to have procedures they are not totally comfortable with			0
the first buzz word was of course ‘ @entity22 ’ but not all women want to be injected with a poisonous toxin			2
' she adds , ' when developing my own range of skincare products one of my priorities was to have an effective option for those women looking for a @entity22 alternative including those pregnant or breast feeding who had to refrain from their usual @entity22 fix			1
' the @entity210 facial begins with a deep cleaning , steaming and intense hydration followed by a generous amount of the @entity90 cream			2
it feels tingly but not unpleasant			0
this is followed up by more gentle blasts of pure @entity161 , layered on to plump up what is now , rather smooth skin			0
the end result promises to leave you with skin as smooth as the bottom of the baby in your arms			0
i emerged glowing , which many facials can admittedly achieve , but also got the added benefit of the lift that i was looking for			0
my skin was tighter and looked less tired than it had been in quite some time			0
i was delighted to look a bit more like the person i was used to seeing in the mirror			0
and after all , post baby , it may take months or even years to get one ’s body back , but women like me are quickly realising that your face does n’t have to wait			0
@entity243 retails for £ 99 and a @entity244 is £ 150			0
both can be found at @entity246 @entity0 is a new mother who writes about the challenges - and joys - facing mothers in their late 30s or early 40s			2
she blogs for @entity250 on a weekly basis .			0
