by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 today took the axe to its controversial investment banking division , saying it would sack thousands of highly - paid bankers			1
a total of 7,000 jobs will go in its investment division , including more than 2,000 in the @entity9 , marking the end of an era for the high - stakes casino banking which defined the financial crisis			1
the ' bold simplification ' plan will cut a total of 19,000 staff around the world by 2016 , including ditching its @entity20 chain of high street banks in @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25			1
the dramatic shake - up from the great survivor of the banking crash comes after its profits fell earlier this year - but at the same time it came under fire for raising bonuses by 10 per cent			1
shares rose by 3.5 per cent in early trading this morning			0
the bloodletting at the investment arm is likely to see dozens of millionaire bankers shown the door			2
the smaller bank will focus on its high street operation and underwriting bonds and shares			0
chief executive @entity48 made clear he hopes the changes will draw a line under a turbulent period for the bank			0
he said : ‘ we will be a focused international bank , operating only in areas where we have capability , scale and competitive advantage			0
‘ in the future , @entity2 will be leaner , stronger , much better balanced and well positioned to deliver lower volatility , higher returns , and growth			2
‘ my goal is unchanged : to create a @entity2 that does business in the right way , with the right values , and delivers the returns that our shareholders deserve			1
’ the move is a major change for the company which became notorious for its so - called ‘ casino banking ’ under its former chief executive @entity73			2
while @entity2 survived the financial crisis without a taxpayer - funded bailout - unlike @entity77 and @entity78 - it did not escape the wrath of politicians			1
@entity81 led a furious attack on the culture of the bank after it admitted traders had manipulated key interest rates			2
at height of the libor rate - fixing scandal , the prime minister blasted : ' people have to take responsibility for the actions and show how they 're going to be accountable for these actions			0
' it 's very important that goes all the way to the top of the organisation			0
' mr @entity73 resigned days later , to be replaced by mr @entity48 who has spent two years overhauling the firm			0
chief executive @entity48 said the bank will axe a total of 19,000 staff around the world by 2016 in a radical shake - up which comes after its profits fell earlier this year in 2008 it was forced to seek a bailout from the @entity108 as its investments division threatened to drag the whole bank down in the same way as the @entity77 and other @entity9 banks			1
the changes will see @entity2 hive off its @entity20 retail banking business into a so - called ' bad bank ' , comprising £ 115 billion of ' non-core ' assets			1
the non-core unit groups together businesses which do not fit the bank 's ' strategic objectives ' or profitability criteria under the review and the bank will ' look to exit or run down these assets over time ' , it said			1
mr @entity48 said : ' this is a bold simplification of @entity2			0
we will be a focused international bank , operating only in areas where we have capability , scale and competitive advantage			0
' in the future , @entity2 will be leaner , stronger , much better balanced and well - positioned to deliver lower volatility , higher returns and growth			1
' former @entity2 chief executive @entity73 with players of @entity138 receiving the @entity140 trophy at @entity141 in 2005 @entity142 boss @entity73 became the face of the @entity145 's defiance in the wake of the financial crisis the spectacle of millionaire investment bankers being told to clear their desks by @entity2 marks the end of the era at the bank personified by @entity73			1
one of the world 's richest and most successful bankers , the high - flying @entity154 was once described as the ' unacceptable face of banking ' by @entity159			2
as the head of @entity162 he built the investment division so dramatically that @entity2 was one of the few banks not to have to be bailed out by the @entity167 controversial figure , he became chief executive of @entity2 in january 2011 with a salary of £ 1.3million and repeated rows about the size of his bonuses			1
but within days he sparked outrage with a claim that four years after the financial crisis , bankers could stop apologising for their role in the disaster			0
' there was a period of remorse and apology for banks and i think that period needs to be over , ' he told mps			0
but he quit in 2012 in the wake of explosive revelations of interest rate - rigging			0
investment banking has been heavily criticised for its large bonuses and appearance of irresponsibility			0
finance director @entity195 announced on tuesday that about 450 directors and managing directors had been made redundant in the first quarter as it was revealed profits had fallen by five per cent			0
in february the bank faced criticism after it was announced staff in its investment arm will get an average bonus of £ 60,100 per employee for 2013 , despite the lender unveiling a 32 per cent drop in underlying annual profits			2
the group hiked its bonus pool by 10 per cent to £ 2.4billion for last year			0
it said its investment banking staff would share £ 1.57billion in bonuses , up 13 per cent from £ 1.39billion in 2012			0
it was the investment banking sector which produced the financial devices which underpinned a boom in the @entity154 ‘ sub-prime ’ property market and which then threatened the whole global financial system with crash in 2008 when the @entity154 housing market started to fall			0
the bank has already announced job losses across the group of 12,000 for this year , but this has been increased to 14,000 as a result of the investment bank changes announced today			2
it brings the total cuts by 2016 to 19,000			2
it comes two days after @entity2 announced that first quarter earnings from the division fell by half , meaning profits at the group slid by 5 per cent			1
the changes will dramatically shrink the importance of the investment bank , which currently accounts for more than half of @entity2 ' size , to no more than 30 per cent by 2016			1
this division employed around 26,200 staff - around 10,000 in the @entity9 - at the end of last year , but this had already shrunk to about 24,000 over the start of 2014			1
@entity2 did not give a breakdown of where the axe would fall when it announced 12,000 job cuts earlier this year			1
but with more than 2,000 gone from the investment bank this year already and 7,000 more announced today , the investment bank looks likely to have shrunk by 10,000 or more - from its size at the end of last year - by 2016			1
highly paid staff at the division have been at the centre of controversy at @entity2 , which last month received a bloody nose from shareholders as it hiked the staff bonus pool by 10 % to £ 2.38 billion last year despite profits falling by a third			1
the @entity262 has complained that this was nearly three times the £ 859 million paid out in dividends to shareholders			0
@entity265 , @entity266 national officer , said : ' these have been extraordinarily turbulent times for ordinary @entity2 workers who have worked hard to keep the bank on track against a backdrop of continued uncertainty and redundancies			2
' the bank needs to recognise their tireless work to put customers first while jobs have been lost and give reassurances over their futures			0

radical shake - up at @entity2 comes after bank 's profits fell earlier this year
investment division to lose 7,000 jobs while a total of 19,000 will go by 2016
at least 7,000 bankers in the @entity290 will be given the chop
@entity293 the end of an era for bank which came to define ' casino ' culture
@entity2 says business will be ' repositioned , simplified and rebalanced '
