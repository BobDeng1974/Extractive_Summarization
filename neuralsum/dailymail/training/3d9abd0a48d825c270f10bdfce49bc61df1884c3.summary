these images show the incredible moment a heron plucks a duckling from the water and swallows it in a single gulp			1
the large bird , spotted in @entity7 , @entity8 , approaches its prey , grabs it and attempts to hold it under the water before finishing it off			1
photographer @entity13 , 66 , witnessed the grim struggle - which lasted five minutes - and captured the images			1
grab : the heron , photographed at the @entity7 near @entity17 , is first seen grabbing the duckling swing : the bird - which would usually eat fish - swings the duckling back and forth as it struggles the heron - a bird which usually chooses fish for its prey - is thought to be around three years old and well - practised in its duck - catching technique			1
mr @entity13 said : ' i initially went down to try and get a picture of the heron in flight - they look quite extraordinary when they ’re flying			2
' the heron was fishing , wading around the water looking for something to eat			2
' then , all of a sudden , the heron spotted this mallard chick , which i would say was probably a couple of months old , and took maybe two steps very quickly towards it , before grabbing it in his mouth			0
' he was shaking it around , which i think made the chick very disorientated , then the heron held it under the water			2
' the whole thing lasted about five or six minutes , he probably did n’t want to swallow it while it was still moving so did his best to stop it from moving			0
dunk : the duckling finds itself thrust back into the water - seemingly in an attempt by the heron to drown it brutal : the heron apparently attempts to drown the duckling , before deciding to swallow it whole gone : the heron can finally be seen swallowing the duckling for good after the five - minute struggle ' he did n’t rush about it , but i could see that digesting it was a struggle			1
the way he did it , i ’m pretty sure he ’d done it before			0
' after that , he relaxed for a little while , but not long after he tried to go for another chick			0
' then he spotted a group of young coot chicks , and tried to go for one of them			0
but these ones were much younger than the chick he ’d already eaten , so the parents were still around			0
' i think the mallard chick had been left to fend for itself , so was more vulnerable			0
' @entity13 , of @entity17 , @entity8 , added : ' i ’ve never seen anything like it before			1
