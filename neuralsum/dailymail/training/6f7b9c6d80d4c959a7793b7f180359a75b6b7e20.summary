by @entity0 we all know how irritating it can be when you ca n't get a tune out of your head			0
but one women suffers from such vivid audio hallucinations she has to start vacuum cleaning to escape them			0
@entity12 , 84 , has musical ear syndrome which means she hears half a dozen songs on a constant loop as if they are being played in the room			1
when she first started suffering from the condition in 2010 , the pensioner thought a noisy neighbour was to blame			1
@entity12 had musical ear syndrome , which means she hears carols and hymns as if they are being played in the room ' when i woke up in the morning i heard music and it was " @entity26 "			1
i thought it was next door because it was going on and on , ' she said			0
but although the mixture of @entity33 carols , popular tunes and hymns sound incredibly real , they are actually being produced by her brain			0
the playlist , which includes @entity39 , you 'll @entity37 , has been repeating ever since			0
@entity12 takes to vacuuming to block out the noise of her condition ' the song @entity43 - every few minutes i 'm wishing someone happy birthday - i hate that one ! ' she told @entity46 's @entity47			1
luckily she does at least like the singer			0
' it 's a tenor , a man 's voice and - it 's a nice voice , very strong and loud and there 's a background of music , ' she explained			2
the grandmother from @entity57 is not the only sufferer but it is a very rare condition affecting just one in 10,000 people aged over 65			1
mrs @entity12 said she developed the condition after taking anti-depressant to deal with the death of her sister @entity64			1
she stopped taking the pills but the songs continued			2
psychiatrist dr @entity67 , said he came across it a number of times among elderly patients at his former gp practice in @entity73			0
he said that unlike tinnitus is has nothing to do with problems in the ear			2
he added : ' we found that an awful lot of people who had hymns and @entity33 carols			2
particularly the hymn abide with me came up again and again - about a 50 per cent chance			0
' it 's quite a reassuring hymn			0
you have got to wonder if there is something generating this need for reassurance when you 're getting older			0
that you 're not alone and that you 're safe			0
' however , other researchers have speculated about whether it is the brain responding to a decline in hearing by plugging the gap with music well - known to the sufferer			1
mrs @entity12 has advised those who suffer from the same syndrome to try and get on with enjoying life @entity102 composer @entity101 who lived in the early 19th century suffered auditory hallucinations the romantic composer @entity101 was said to have had the condition and reported hearing an ' angelic choir ' singing to him			1
unfortunately there is no cure for the condition , although dr @entity67 says sufferers could help themselves by talking about it , distracting themselves , socialising more and listening to different music			2
mrs @entity12 resorted to vacuuming , singing at the top of her voice and getting angry and telling the music to ' shut up			1
' however , over time she has found a way to make peace with the condition			0
she decided to speak out about her condition to help overcome the stigma that is attached to ' hearing things '			2
people with mental illnesses such as schizophrenia can suffer from psychiatric auditory hallucinations			2
these tend to be voices rather than music and are perceived to be talking to or about the sufferer			0
those with musical ear syndrome experience non-psychiatric auditory hallucinations - that is music or words that are n't particularly meaningful to them			1
mrs @entity12 said : ' i say to the poor people who are like me , do n't worry about it too much , get on with life and enjoy yourself as much as you can and be happy			1
' the @entity46 @entity47 episode featuring @entity12 is available to view on @entity145 until sunday 23rd december			1
