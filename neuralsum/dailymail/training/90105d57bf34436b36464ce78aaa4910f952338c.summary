by @entity0 published : 15:50 est , 25 august 2013 updated : 16:15 est , 25 august 2013 @entity1 have lifted the @entity2 but were today denied the chance to make history when the umpires chose to stop play due to bad light			1
in a decision that followed procedure to the letter but baffled players and fans , @entity1 's fearless attempt to catch up with @entity9 was cut short with the game minutes away from a thrilling climax			1
with @entity1 needing just 21 more runs in four overs to seal their first - ever 4 - 0 @entity2 victory , umpires @entity18 and @entity19 were booed by a capacity @entity24 crowd when they took the players off as the light closed in at 7.36pm			1
they 've urned it : @entity29 lifts the @entity2 urn and ( below ) gives it a little kiss as his teammates celebrate their win with champagne victory : @entity1 may not have won the battle , but the home side won the war in this controversial series euphoric : player @entity41 thrusts the urn as he celebrates @entity1 's win with fans at the @entity24 thrilling : cricketer @entity45 lifts his son @entity46 as he celebrates @entity1 's win after a frustrating end to the day 's paly leader : captain @entity29 reaches out to fans who booed the umpires decision to cut play short fading : as the sky darkened and the floodlights were switched on at the @entity24 , the umpires began to assess how long play could last stand back : umpire @entity18 pushes @entity57 captain @entity56 away as the officials check their light meters and make the controversial call calling it quits : umpire @entity18 ( centre ) and @entity19 ( left ) checked light levels before ordering the players off the field with just four overs left to play it did n't stop them ! a game of cricket between @entity71 and @entity72 in @entity73 showed no signs of stoppng despite dense fog and fading light outraged fans booed the abrupt decision , which made for an ill - fitting end to a triumphant series win for @entity29 's side			1
commentators have criticised the decision to end proceedings , saying it sums up how the sport 's pedantic laws hamper the game			0
had things been allowed to play out to the end , @entity1 were strong favourites to claim a 4 - 0 home ashes win for the first time ever and give @entity94 the dubious honour of being only the third captain - after sir @entity96 ( 1968 ) and @entity97 ( 2006 ) - to lose a @entity98 having declared twice			2
amid the frustration , it should not be overlooked that a draw leaves @entity9 without a win in an @entity2 series for the first time since 1977			0
@entity1 captain @entity29 said winning the @entity2 series as the ' proudest moment of my life '			1
record breaker : @entity111 salutes the crowd after his 29th dismissal of the series - the highest ever in a series by a wicket keeper useful : @entity117 hits out after a useful 47 gave @entity1 a chance at winning the match just short : @entity120 's 45 meant he was five runs short of recording at least a half century in every test in this series ' it would have been nice to finish with a win but the rules and regulations are there for a reason , ' @entity29 said at the presentation ceremony after lifting the famous urn while red and white fireworks erupted around the ground to celebrate @entity1 's third ashes win in a row			1
' the umpires have strict guidelines and , if it was day three , we would have gone off			0
' this morning our job was to try and make it as difficult as possible to stop @entity9 from pushing on for a win and to make our chances of victory easier			0
' the crowds have been fantastic for all five tests and i 'm privileged to captain this group of guys			0
winning this series is the proudest moment of my life			0
' for the whole of this match @entity1 had crawled along towards the most pragmatic of draws but they rose to the challenge in the most spectacular way to thrillingly march towards that unprecedented @entity159 4 - 0 @entity2 success			0
fired up : @entity160 celebrates taking the wicket of @entity162 having a go : @entity1 needed 224 from the final sessions to win the match jovial : @entity1 fans enjoying the final days play before light begins to fade and the tone of the event changes drastically the consolation for the frustrated crowd was that they could not have possibly imagined that they would see anything other than a low - key finale to this @entity2 series when they made their way through soggy @entity179 yesterday			1
the run chase which saw @entity1 move towards their target of 227 in 44 overs would not have been possible had @entity94 not thrown down the gauntlet with a declaration that gave his side little chance of victory			2
@entity9 have spent the whole of this test trying to rewrite history , goading @entity1 over their perceived timidity and ignoring the fact they were 3 - 0 down in an attempt to gain the morale high ground ahead of november â€™s return			0
highest total : @entity1 's 377 in the first innings was the highest score they 've set during this @entity2 series dejection : @entity9 captain @entity94 looks on as @entity1 rack up their total skittled : @entity160 scattered @entity162 ' stumps token : @entity94 was the only one to offer any resistance to @entity160 's brilliance , the captain scoring 28 not out jubilant : @entity1 fans ca n't believe what they are seeing as @entity9 's batsmen fell apart			2

controversial decision met by boos from frustrated fans
victorious @entity1 side just 21 runs in four overs off *comprehensive* win
