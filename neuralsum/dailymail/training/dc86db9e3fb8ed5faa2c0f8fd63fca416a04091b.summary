the @entity2 outbreak of @entity3 in cats was a ' wake - up call ' that justifies the continued badger cull , @entity0 said			1
the environment secretary announced that the controversial pilot cull of badgers in @entity10 and @entity11 would continue this year			1
but he postponed a roll - out of the pilots to other areas after an expert panel criticised the effectiveness of last - year 's cull			1
princess @entity20 's remarks have been met with fury from animal rights campaigners and zoologists , who argue that gassing - which was banned in 1982 - is inhumane ( file picture ) mr @entity0 said an outbreak of bovine tuberculosis in nine cats in @entity30 , @entity31 , demonstrated the scale of the problem			1
the @entity34 revealed last week that four people caught @entity3 from their cats last year after it was transferred from cattle , possibly via badgers			1
one of the victims , 19 - year - old @entity40 , was struck down with pneumonia and had to have emergency surgery			2
doctors believe @entity40 and her mother , @entity44 , caught the disease from her kitten , @entity47			2
seven of the nine affected cats had bite marks and wounds which suggested the disease had been transmitted either by badgers or other cats			1
speaking in the @entity54 , mr @entity0 said : ' as we have seen graphically with the experience in @entity30 , this is a disease which does transport to other species			1
' it is a zoonosis [ an infectious disease ] which can be caught be human beings			2
' in the @entity30 example , it looks as though the cats had the same spoligotype as cattle			1
last month @entity40 , 19 , revealed she had caught @entity3 while cleaning an open wound on her pet cat , @entity47 ' there is not yet a direct link with badgers , but it may be that badgers had the same type of @entity3			0
' it just shows it is a real wake up call to us all , that this is a deadly serious disease			0
' we 've got to address it , not just in cattle but also in wildlife , because we want to have healthy cattle , healthy wildlife and healthy humans			0
' @entity3 is a huge problem which has devastated @entity87 's farming industry			0
the spread of the disease is thought to be accelerated by badgers , and it can also be passed to other animals including cats , rodents and deer			1
around 40 people a year catch bovine tb , usually from unpasteurised milk or from working closely with infected cows			0
but the @entity30 outbreak was the first documented case in the world of humans catching the disease from cats			1
the two pilot badger culls , in @entity10 and @entity106 , will continue with improvements recommended by an independent expert panel , said mr @entity0			1
the panel 's report said more and better trained marksmen were needed			0
the study found that less than 48 per cent of badgers in the @entity106 area were killed , and less than 39 per cent in @entity10 , compared to the 70 per cent which scientific research says is needed to cut @entity3 in livestock			1
it also found that a number of badgers took more than five minutes to die , others were hit but not retrieved and some were possibly missed altogether			2
mr @entity0 said plans to expand the culls to ten other areas have been cancelled			1
he said : ' the four year culls in @entity106 and @entity10 are pilots and we always expected to learn lessons from them			1
' it is crucial we get this right			0
that is why we are taking a responsible approach , accepting recommendations from experts to make the pilots better			0
' doing nothing is not an option			0
@entity3 is a terrible disease which is devastating our cattle and dairy industries and causing misery for many people in rural communities			0
' we need to do everything we can , as set out in our strategy , to make @entity145 free			0
' the government and farmers insist culling is necessary to tackle the disease which saw more than 26,000 cattle slaughtered in @entity145 last year , but opponents say it is inhumane and ineffective and alternatives such as vaccination should be pursued			0
opponents of the cull were quick to criticise the decision to push on with the plans			2
environment secretary @entity0 said plans to expand the culls to ten other areas have been cancelled @entity163 environment secretary @entity162 said mr @entity0 was declaring ' open season ' on badgers			1
she said : ' there is no strategy here , this is an unscientific fudge for you to try and save face			0
' how can you possibly justify continuing a method of killing , free shooting , which has been found to be inhumane by the independent scientific advisors ? ' you ignore scientific evidence , make a decision based on your own prejudice and then offer retrospectively to tell me and others what the policy is and expect us to agree with you			2
; if you proceed as described , your culls can no longer called evidence - based policy ... what you have announced now is an open season on badgers in the culling areas			2
' mp @entity188 , a prominent @entity189 opponent of the cull , said the pilot culls were ' a cruel , indiscriminate and ineffective means of culling badgers '			2
she told @entity194 : ' the culls were an expensive failure and as a consequence bovine tb could in fact spread to areas that are currently free of the disease			2
' the @entity201 , which supported the cull pilots , criticised mr @entity0 for failing to consult it and other interested parties			1
president @entity205 said it would examine the ' concerns about the humaneness and efficacy ' raised by the report before deciding its response			0
he said : ' we have made it clear that we can only support badger culling if the method used is humane , safe and effective			0
' that is why @entity201 called for controlled shooting to be tested and critically evaluated against these criteria by an independent group of experts			0
' but @entity222 president @entity221 said : ' obviously there is bitter disappointment within the farming community that we are not extending the roll - out of the culling strategy at this time			0

@entity0 says cull in @entity106 and @entity10 will continue
but environment secretary cancels plan to extend cull to 10 areas
