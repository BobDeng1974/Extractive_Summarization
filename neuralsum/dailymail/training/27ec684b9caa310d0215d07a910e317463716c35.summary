scroll down for audio of the boom as the same time as a loud boom was reported by a number of people in @entity3 on saturday afternoon as a similar noise was heard more than 3,000 miles away by people throughout the @entity5 one resident in @entity26 , @entity3 , took the noise as clearly a sign of extra terrestrial life ' just heard an explosion in @entity10 that shook our house			1
anyone else feel it ? our neighbors all felt it too , ' wrote @entity37 on the @entity39 page			0
for one resident in @entity26 , the noise was clearly a sign of extra terrestrial life			0
' i was at home when a large boom sound accrued			2
everyone in town heard and felt it			0
some surroundings towns felt it too			0
there is no explanation , ' the unnamed person wrote on @entity54			2
state police received numerous calls about the loud boom , but have no idea what caused it			1
meteorologists at the @entity62 office on the grounds of the @entity64 did not report hearing or feeling anything at their office and do not believe that there could be a weather - related explanation			1
@entity72 personnel at the control tower did not report seeing or hearing anything either			1
one possible explanation is that the loud noise and ground shaking could have been a meteorite breaking up in the atmosphere , which would result in a sonic boom residents in @entity3 described the noise as loud enough to shake their homes and rattle windows			1
one possible explanation is that the loud noise and ground shaking could have been a meteorite breaking up in the atmosphere , which would result in a sonic boom			1
the @entity88 did not report any seismic activity or earthquakes in the area at the time of the shaking , although a small earthquake did take place just two hours later			1
the magnitude 1.5 quake was centered about four miles west of @entity98 and happened at 6:27 p.m. local time			1
but @entity100 , a geophysicist with the @entity88 in @entity101 , told @entity39 that it would be impossible to attribute the reported noises to the @entity98 earthquake hours later			1
any earthquake that registers 2.0 or less on the @entity106 is a microearthquake and no damaged was reported as a result of the quake , according to law enforcement agencies			2
a loud boom was reported by a number of residents in @entity3 on saturday afternoon in locations including @entity8 ( pictured ) , @entity9 , @entity10 and as far north as @entity11 at the same time as residents in @entity116 reported hearing noises , hundreds of @entity114 users in the @entity5 reported hearing similar sounds - that also shook their windows			1
an audio recording of the ' loud bangs ' , taken by a woman as she sat at home in @entity124 , south @entity125 , might shed light on what is really behind the unexplained noise			1
some people in @entity130 have suggested that unusual weather conditions might be the source , but the @entity133 today dismissed the claims			2
others on @entity114 suggested that it could be traced back to controlled explosions or military exercises			0
meanwhile , conspiracy theorists took to social media to claim that aliens were to blame			1
@entity142 said that she was watching tv at home when the unexplained sounds started			0
she told @entity146 : ' i was just at home watching tv when i could n't hear the program due to the loud noises			1
it was very distracting as it went on for ages			0
people throughout the @entity5 , including @entity153 , reported hearing ' rumbling ' sounds around 9pm and 10pm last night ' i went out to look for fireworks but i could n't see anything in the sky			1
that 's when i recorded the clip to send to my family to see if they could hear the same thing			2
' the 27 - year - old said that her family , who live roughly seven miles away in @entity164 , south @entity125 , could also hear the sounds , which lasted for about 30 minutes			1
she then turned to @entity114 to see if anyone could explain what they were			0
many suspected sonic booms similar to ones which shook @entity171 last month when two @entity173 jets intercepted a @entity175 cargo plane in @entity5 airspace			1
but a @entity178 spokesman told @entity146 she had no records of any jets being scrambled last night			2
the denial only served to fuel an outpouring of saturday night speculation on social media			1
within minutes @entity114 users had started spreading hashtags from the straightforward ( # loudbangs ) to the slightly melodramatic ( # omgwereallgoingtodie )			0
many of the reports were picked up by @entity114 user @entity191 , who said space debris re-entering the earth 's atmosphere could have been responsible			2
' space debris such as old satellites and things can cause sonic booms heard over very large areas , ' he told @entity146			2
' it 's the same for big meteors or rocks that come in			2
' there are also some rare meteorologic phenomena that can cause rumbling or bangs apart from thunder			0
' the only other explanation could be supersonic aircraft			0
there was very little wind last night so conditions were perfect for sound to travel very long distances			0
' in response , science writer @entity217 , said on @entity114 that debris from @entity222 satellite @entity220 could be to blame , but admitted that the timings ' were n't a good fit '			0
reaction : there was an explosion of activity on @entity114 , where some users came up with their own theories others thought that the loud noises might be due to unusual weather events , such as space weather , electrical storms or ferocious thunder storms			1
but the @entity133 said today that there had been no reports of such weather last night			0
a spokesman told @entity146 : ' it definitely was n't meteorological '			0
dozens of the reports focused around @entity124 , south @entity125 , where baffled @entity114 users were asking each other what had happened			0
# spooked : was it an alien invasion , a meteor , the @entity249 - or simply a few stray fireworks ? the @entity251 said that a fireworks display in @entity124 could have been the source			0
but that does not explain why other noises were heard in @entity256 , @entity257 , @entity258 , @entity259 and @entity260			0
@entity261 , who lives in @entity262 , @entity263 , said his dogs ' went crazy for a couple of minutes ' after hearing what he had assumed were fireworks			0
the noises prompted conspiracy theories and immediate claims of a ' media blackout '			2
@entity114 user @entity272 wrote : ' this is how we 'll find our that @entity249 has begun			0
it 'll be a @entity114 hashtag long before any official announcement ! '			0
