possible danger : chemical phthalates is used to soften plastics and can be found in children 's toys chemicals found in every home may cause breast cancer , asthma , infertility and birth defects , global health chiefs said yesterday			1
they warn the gender - bending compounds – used in toys , pvc flooring , car dashboards and credit cards – have ‘ serious implications ’ for health			1
in a landmark report , the @entity19 suggested a ban might be needed to protect future generations			1
it says it is ‘ reasonable to suspect ’ chemical substances called phthalates of harming female fertility and linked them with rising rates of childhood illnesses including leukaemia			1
also under suspicion is bisphenol a , which is found in a host of daily items including tin cans and sunglasses			2
the man - made compounds are thought to interfere with the natural hormones that are key to our growth , development and overall health			0
the @entity19 said there was ‘ very strong evidence ’ in animals they can interfere with thyroid hormones – something that can cause brain damage , stunted intelligence , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism			1
for prostate cancer ‘ significant evidence ’ exists of a link with agricultural pesticides			2
and there was some evidence linking exposure in pregnancy to weight gain in infants and children and potential links to breast cancer			1
in the same report ten years ago , the @entity66 agency said there was only ‘ weak evidence ’ that gender - bending chemicals were harming human health			0
declaring the chemicals a global threat , the new report ’s authors said humans and animals were exposed to hundreds of compounds , many of which have yet to be identified or properly studied			0
some are inhaled in dust , others make their way into our bodies from food or simply licking our fingers			2
the @entity19 stops short of saying the chemicals actually caused the illnesses but did say that in some cases , the evidence was very strong			1
the report – state of the @entity95 – is the most comprehensive of its kind because rather than focusing on one chemical or one illness , it evaluates all the evidence			0
it says : ‘ the diverse systems affected by endocrine - disrupting chemicals likely include all hormonal systems and range from those controlling development and function of reproductive organs to the tissues and organs regulating metabolism and satiety			0
‘ effects on these systems can lead to obesity , infertility or reduced fertility , learning and memory difficulties , adult - onset diabetes or cardiovascular disease , as well as a variety of other diseases			2
’ report : the compounds , also found in pvc floors , can have ' serious implications ' the @entity19 warned @entity127 risks : the dangerous chemical is found in many objects we touch with out bare hand every day , such as credit cards and car dashboards worryingly , it warns the chemicals assessed so far by scientists may only be the ‘ tip of the iceberg ’ – and there could be many other potentially harmful compounds out there			1
it cautions that the key role of hormones in the development of tissues and organs means that unborn babies and young children may be particularly vulnerable			2
the report – written over two years by international experts who collated and weighted scientific studies on the topic – also states the rise in some conditions is too rapid to be blamed on genes alone			0
‘ the prevalence of paediatric asthma has more than doubled over the past 20 years and is now the leading cause of child hospitalisations and school absenteeism , ’ it said			2
‘ certain birth defects , such as those of the male reproductive organs are on the rise			1
the incidence of paediatric leukaemia and brain cancer have risen , as has the incidence of testicular cancer			0
these are stark health statistics			0
’ the @entity19 says wildlife is also at risk and calls for much more research into the chemicals and their effects – and says that there may be a case for banning or restricting them			1
dr @entity179 , the @entity19 ’s director for public health and environment , said : ‘ the latest science shows that communities around the globe are being exposed to endocrine - disrupting chemicals and their associated risks			1
we all have a responsibility to protect future generations			0
’ @entity190 , of the campaign group @entity191 , said the @entity192 was trying to tighten up the regulation of gender - bending chemicals but the @entity195 was in favour of the least stringent measures			0
she added : ‘ this report bears testimony to the on - going failure of regulatory agencies to reduce exposure to hormone disrupting chemicals , which are implicated in the increased rates of hormone - related cancers and other diseases			0
‘ thankfully , the @entity192 is now trying to come to agreement on how to identify such hormone disrupting chemicals , so that they can be effectively regulated , but unfortunately the @entity195 is trying to thwart this process in a bid to limit the number of chemicals that will fall under the regulatory axe			0
’ the @entity215 said it was important to note that naturally - occurring substances in beer , chocolate and coffee can have more powerful effects on the body ’s hormones than man - made chemicals .			1
