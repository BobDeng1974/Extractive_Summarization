it is a job no man would envy			2
an unlucky biologist has been filmed trying to cut open a whale carcass - which exploded all over him			1
the sperm whale was one of two which died this week after being beached in the @entity7 in the @entity8 , captured on camera by the @entity10			1
so it fell to unlucky @entity12 , a marine biologist at the @entity25 of the @entity7 , to cut open the carcass yesterday			1
he had never cut open a whale before so he approached the pungent 45ft corpse gingerly			2
as soon as he began working , the gas trapped inside exploded , spewing tons of organs and guts into the air			2
the main part of the huge blast just missed him			0
he told @entity36 : ' the animal was more than two days old when we took it so we knew there would be some pressure on the inside , but nothing like what happened			2
easy does it : marine biologist @entity12 approaches the 45ft whale with an extra-long sharp knife there she blows : without warning a trapped pocket of gas in the carcass bursts , ripping the corpse open within a fraction of a second the whale 's insides burst out from the carcass , showering the biologist organs : mr @entity12 stands apparently stunned as the whale 's insides fly into the air in front of him shock : the whale 's insides were flung for several yards across the beach in the @entity7 , @entity8 as the split - second explosion subsides the biologist begins to react and starts running away from the scene not a whale of a time : the unfortunate worker spins on his heels as the worst of the explosion finishes tough work : thankfully @entity12 wore red overalls			1
the whale was one of two which became trapped tragic : the carcass still emitting gas			0
the whale had become trapped and was too heavy for locals to help gruseome history : the blast happened on the @entity84 , which have a long history of whaling which has been called barbaric by animal rights activists			1
this whale 's skeleton will be used in a museum when an animal dies , bacteria inside the carcass produce methane as part of the decomposition process			1
if this is not let out of the body gradually it builds up , exploding at the first opportunity			0
whales are the most extreme because their huge size makes the consequences of a gas build - up so much greater			2
living toads in @entity106 , @entity107 , started spontaneously combusting in 2005			0
it was thought crows were picking out their livers , leaving a hole , so when the toads puffed themselves up as a defence mechanism , their whole bodies burst			0
and @entity116 funeral attendants hurriedly drilled a hole in the coffin of the overweight @entity120 king @entity119 to let out gases - after an apparent botched embalming job			2
' we could n't imagine it would happen like that so it was a little bit more of a surprise			1
' it was n't a shock			0
in the situation i was more worried about something worse happening or anyone getting hurt			0
' we were cutting along the dorsal part of the animal so when it exploded it did so in a very controlled way			1
' it was very loud , i suppose			0
it 's something everyone here is talking about			0
' footage of the incident , which happened at 2pm yesterday , has already been seen on @entity145 more than 300,000 times			0
the islands are 200 miles north of @entity148 but have been under the banner of @entity21 for 200 years , after previously being ruled by @entity150			1
people on the @entity7 have been hunting pilot whales for centuries , but the practice has been condemned as cruel and unnecessary by animal rights groups			1
despite the gory incident , the locals are still determined to put the skeleton in their museum as a reminder of their culture , and they are already busy cutting up the remains of the carcass			1
the whale 's flesh will be thrown away			0
remote : a map showing the location of the @entity7 in the @entity8 lying 200 miles north of @entity148 , the @entity84 have 50,000 people but 700 miles of coastline and some of the highest sea cliffs in the world			1
sperm whales dive deeper than any other great whale and swim far north			0

@entity175 beached in the @entity7
it exploded all over a museum worker who wanted its skeleton for exhibit
cool - as - ice @entity12 simply called it ' a little bit of a surprise '
people in the @entity21 community are still *planning* to use the remains
@entity7 whaling is ancient but condemned by animal rights groups
