by @entity0 published : 10:51 est , 10 february 2014 @entity2 : 11:53 est , 10 february 2014 @entity3 are back on the trail of @entity6 defender @entity5 but are set to be disappointed			1
the powerful @entity7 , a cult hero at @entity9 , has opened discussions over a new contract and wants to stay with @entity6			2
@entity3 coach @entity12 is keen to add a new right back with @entity5 , @entity15 's @entity14 and @entity17 's @entity16 among his prospective targets			1
blocked : @entity6 are set to reject any offer from @entity21 champions @entity3 for @entity5 ( right ) wanted man : @entity3 boss @entity12 is targeting a new right back this summer and @entity5 is his no 1 target alternatives : @entity3 are also looking at @entity15 's @entity14 ( left ) and @entity17 's @entity16 indeed @entity5 was courted by the @entity21 champions last summer but he was assured he had a significant role to play under @entity28 and the @entity30 coach has been satisfied with the 29 - year - old 's contribution to @entity6 's challenge for the @entity35 title			1
@entity5 has two years left on a deal worth around £ 120,000 a week but is expected to revise those terms and extend by another two years if all goes to plan over the coming weeks			2
he has figured in 31 games this season and scored the decisive goal in in what could prove a pivotal 1 - 0 win at @entity15 last week			1
he is regarded by @entity28 as one of his trusted senior professionals and his influence on the squad will prove all the more important as @entity6 bring in younger players in the summer			2
@entity48 , the 19 - year - old @entity49 defender , is arriving from @entity50 and 18 - year - old left back @entity52 is expected from @entity53 should they successfully fend off competition from @entity55 and @entity15 for his £ 25m transfer			1
@entity6 were once again among clubs represented at @entity59 's game against @entity60 on sunday.the @entity9 club were joined by scouts from @entity55 , @entity15 and @entity63 as they continue to monitor @entity60 defender @entity64			1
@entity65 revealed last week that 22 - year - old @entity64 and his club mate @entity66 were among the centre backs being considered by @entity55 in particular as they weigh up prospective replacements for @entity69 and @entity70			1
@entity71 would prefer someone with greater experience but wo n't let that get in the way of recruiting a player of such promise			0
get to grips : @entity6 have been tracking @entity60 right back @entity64 in recent months described by @entity79 as ' @entity80 but a veldheer ( a general ) ' following a man - of - the - match performance against @entity83 in november , @entity64 has overcome fears about an old knee injury to show why he is regarded as one of @entity60 's finest academy graduates			1
much credit has also been given to his one - to - one coaching sessions with former @entity55 defender @entity90			1
underlining a determination to snub all bids though , @entity60 director @entity91 says the club intend to increase his £ 9,000 a week wages and extend his contract beyond 2017			2
' i will barricade the doors and i will go and stand behind the door myself to stop them from taking him			0
he means too much to us , ' said @entity91			0
' @entity90 has been working on him really hard with individual coaching at @entity60			2
he is a massive talent and players have been leaving this club too early in their careers			0
' @entity109 are trying to see if @entity35 clubs can outbid @entity111 in the battle for teenage prospect @entity113			1
@entity111 have already had a £ 3.2million bid rejected in recent days for the 17 - year - old who has been studied closely by @entity116 and @entity55 over the past two years and been hailed as a player of even greater potential than @entity119			1
twinkle toes : @entity111 have already bid for @entity113 , but @entity109 want more money for him the @entity123 league leaders are due to send a delegation to @entity125 this week as they crank up the pressure on @entity128 to sell			1
they see @entity113 as the long - term replacement for @entity131 and are ready to give him time to develop as the @entity123 midfield maestro closes out his career at the @entity134			2
@entity109 chairman @entity135 wants closer to £ 12m for @entity113 but recognises most of that will be offered in instalments			1
however , that wo n't stop @entity128 asking @entity35 sides to make them an offer in the hope of triggering an auction			2
@entity111 , meanwhile , have added @entity145 centre half @entity143 to their list of potential summer recruits			2
the @entity149 defender has been watched by @entity55 , @entity63 and @entity6			1
@entity15 are in discussions over signing 12 - year - old @entity151 , which has raised eyebrows at his club @entity154			1
@entity151 and his family are prepared to move to @entity156 after deciding @entity15 's academy would be the best place for the youngster 's development			1
talking to the @entity163 media , @entity154 academy director @entity161 said : ' we certainly think it 's scary here			2
it 's not a trend we want to see			2
i understand this opportunity may never come again so i do n't want to judge anyone			0
' we 've been in contact with @entity15 and these guys have gone over with our approval and we had a coach who was with them in @entity156			2
' i have not heard of clubs looking for 12 - year - olds in @entity163 before			1
but the work is going in an entirely different way abroad , especially in the @entity35			0
' they 're betting harder and harder and taking in all younger players			0
' city are also among @entity183 clubs keen on @entity186 's 17 - year - old @entity185 forward @entity187 who made his senior debut last month			1
he scored 20 goals for @entity186 ’s youth side last season			0
@entity63 are looking at inviting @entity195 prospect @entity193 back for further trials			1
the 15 - year - old right winger has just completed a short spell at @entity63 's academy and met up with idols @entity200 and @entity202			1
he told dif.se : ' it was powerful			0
@entity200 is my idol so when i got to meet him , it was incredible			0
yet i did meet all the first team players every day at the training ground when they were in , for example , the restaurant and the pool			0
' the most sociable was @entity202			0
he always came down and talked with the young players and gave advice and tips			0
' @entity217 's ongoing improvement at @entity187 has been attracting admiring glances from far and wide this season			1
the @entity220 full back has been one of several success stories at @entity224 this season as he continues to develop			0
@entity63 and @entity55 are both considering approaches for the summer , but so are @entity226			1
@entity227 is replacing right back @entity228 and @entity217 has been recommended as one to bear in mind			2
attack - minded : both @entity55 and @entity63 are tracking @entity187 's right back @entity217 @entity226 general manager @entity231 said : ' there ’s a lot of dialogue between myself and @entity227 and it ’s clear that when changing the formation , you need new players			1
in june , we ’ll sort out what needs sorting			0
' @entity187 will resist all offers as they look to build on this season 's performances and challenge for a top - four place again next year			1
however , they could be offered a healthy profit on the £ 60,000 @entity71 paid to @entity248 in 2009			0
manager @entity249 wants to sign @entity250 on a permanent deal and will look at the possibility of signing for @entity253			0
