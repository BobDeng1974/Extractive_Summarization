by @entity0 for @entity1 parents of university students whose summer adventures were ruined when a travel firm went bust claim it continued to advertise tours and request payments while it was in financial straits			1
furious students , their parents and @entity14 charities that benefited from the excursions all say there was no indication @entity18 , trading as @entity19 , was in trouble			1
hundreds of students continued to raise cash and spend thousands of pounds on travel costs and equipment as the company struggled to stay afloat before it entered receivership thursday , just days after it asked some students for final payment			1
hard work : student @entity30 held events in the community to raise funds for charity now , the students are potentially out of pocket for the costs and the charities have lost an important source of fundraising			1
@entity42 ’s 20 - year - old son , @entity41 , was one of almost 40 @entity44 students who were blindsided at the very last second and forced to abandon their trek to the summit of @entity48 in @entity49			1
the students were checking in at @entity51 on thursday when they received emails or text messages alerting them that @entity18 was no longer in business			2
mr @entity42 said : ‘ they all travelled from all over the @entity14 to be at @entity51 and literally as they were at the check - in desk they were advised that the trip would n’t be taking place			2
‘ it ’s better that it happened when it did			2
however , many students are already on their travel experiences and the fact that we were asked for the final payment days ago when the company must have had an indication of its financial problems leaves a very , very bad feeling			2
‘ financial problems do n’t arise within the space of 72 hours			2
it ’s a month - by - month thing			0
’ @entity48 : students were forced to abandon their trip after @entity18 went into administration parents are demanding to know how long @entity18 was quietly in financial straits , and they say the company could have done a better job at handling the situation			1
mr @entity42 said : ‘ i think the company should have been far more transparent			0
it should have been honest and communicated earlier			0

’ the @entity93 says it has taken action to ensure travellers are protected , with around 100 currently abroad with @entity18 who have scheduled airline tickets so will be able to travel home as planned			0
@entity100 students are walking the @entity101 on a trip organised by @entity19 the @entity93 said those who were due to go on future trips with the company who received an @entity107 certificate when booking are protected for any money they paid directly to the company			1
an apparent customer named @entity112 took to @entity113 to share her anger at the situation			0
she wrote : ' still no contact from # studentadventures - what an absolutely disgraceful company ... @entity121 situation			0
' another , named only as @entity123 , said : ' absolutely appalling that # studentadventures have n't had the decency to personally contact participants yet			0
' students and parents are also questioning how none of the company 's partners noticed when @entity18 's @entity107 licence was not renewed with the @entity93 in march			1
mr @entity42 said that should have been ' a huge red flag '			0
parents have expressed concerns for students who are carrying out charity expeditions after @entity18 ceased trading and cancelled all of its services			1

a group of students was scheduled to trek along the @entity145 for two weeks in september parent @entity146 , from @entity147 , said he is concerned about the well - being of his 19 - year - old daughter , @entity149 , but is hoping she will be able to achieve her goal of climbing @entity153 's highest mountain			1
as the situation unfolded in the @entity14 , the @entity155 student was in transit in @entity49 and was supposed to begin her climb on saturday			0
her father said : ‘ i ’m really concerned that she ’s stuck in in @entity161 and she ca n’t get out , but we ’ll find out			0

angry students took to @entity113 to share their frustrations about the lack of information available @entity100 students who are currently walking the @entity101 in @entity178 are safe and will continue their charity challenge with no problems , according to @entity181 , the university ’s students ’ union			2
@entity181 said it believes the monies raised for the charities are already with the charities			2

charities - which could be left millions of pounds out of pocket - and student unions are urging those students not to travel			1
@entity209 added : ‘ this is a great shock and extremely disappointing for many students who planned to fundraise for numerous charities			1
‘ however , we will be working with those who had bookings with @entity18 to ensure that the necessary support is available to all of those who have been affected			0
