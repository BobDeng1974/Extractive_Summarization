the surveys are the first comprehensive opinion polls in @entity6 and @entity12 since @entity1 decided to throw down the gauntlet to @entity2			1
conducted separately in @entity12 and @entity44 by polling form @entity36 , the surveys apparently showed there is more support in @entity12 for @entity6 leaving the @entity32 than there is north of the border			0
scots do not want the @entity23 to meddle in whether they end their 300 - year union with @entity12 , but @entity23 voters are much keener to have a say in the matter			1

fewer than one in four say they will gain			0

@entity6 secretary @entity56 yesterday dismissed the findings , claiming there was no demand from @entity23 voters to be given a say in the @entity11 ’s future			1

he added : ‘ @entity1 has been behaving like @entity121 – perhaps he is “ frit ” , as she used to say			0
’ mrs @entity121 memorably used the @entity125 dialect word in a scathing 1983 @entity127 riposte to @entity128 jibes that she was frightened of calling an election			0
its use by mr @entity2 appeared to sting no 10 into action with a spokesman saying the prime minister was happy to hold talks with the @entity137 leader			0
