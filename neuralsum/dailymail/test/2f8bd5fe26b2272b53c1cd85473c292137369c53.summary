they share the same side - swept fair hair and cheeky smile … and when they ’re perched on steps wearing knee socks and pullovers decorated with @entity7 , it ’s royally difficult to tell these two little boys apart			0
but one is hrh @entity10 of @entity12 , third in line to the throne and born into a life of palaces and privilege – while the other is plain old @entity20 from @entity21 , @entity22			1
two - year - old @entity20 ’s mother – whose name , as it happens , is @entity27 – and father @entity28 , 41 , are regularly stopped by people who want to have their photograph taken with the prince ’s lookalike			1
she said : ’ some of my friends who have little children had mentioned to me how @entity38 looked like @entity40 and were saying how cute it was			1
‘ then people started stopping me at the supermarket , and i realised it was more than just me being a biased mum			0
’ keen royal watcher mrs @entity35 is always keen to see each new photograph of @entity40 when it is released by his parents @entity51 and @entity27 to check if the two boys from very different worlds are continuing to grow up looking the same			2
she said : ‘ they both have the same brown eyes and lovely , rosy , chubby cheeks and when @entity38 's hair is in a side parting , it is uncanny how the two boys look so similar			1
‘ @entity38 , who celebrated his second birthday on march 8 , is slightly older than @entity40 , who will be two on july 22			2
two - year - old @entity20 ’s mother – whose name is also @entity27 – is regularly stopped by people who want to have their photograph taken with the prince ’s lookalike a nation awaits : the real @entity10 is due to become a big brother at any moment friends of mrs @entity35 have suggested she should look into getting work for @entity38 as a royal look - a - like , some of whom can earn up to £ 1,000 a day			1
but she is not keen - as she admits her son ’s behaviour sometimes falls rather short of regal			1
she said : ‘ i might look into it , but to be honest , @entity38 does not follow orders too well			0
‘ i do call him my little prince sometimes but his behaviour is not that of a royal			0
‘ at nursery they describe him as ' busy ' and he is always rushing around and exploring			0
’ mrs @entity35 added that her husband was not even aware of their son ’s claim to fame			2
she said : ‘ @entity28 is not a fan of the @entity93 so when his mum started telling him how @entity38 looked like @entity10 , he had to look for pictures of him to see what she was talking about			0
’ the real @entity40 , of course , is due to become a big brother at any moment – and in a very modern move , the birth will be formally announced on royal social media accounts before a notice is posted on the traditional easel outside @entity105 .			0

@entity20 from @entity21 looks just like @entity10 of @entity12
both two - year - olds have the same rosy cheeks and a similar *hairstyle*
even @entity38 's mother - who is also called @entity27 - thinks they look alike
while he looks like @entity40 , @entity38 's mother admits her son ’s behaviour sometimes falls rather short of regal
