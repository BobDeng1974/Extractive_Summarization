former minister sir @entity0 has called for the five - year fixed parliaments law to be repealed @entity2 is under growing pressure to agree to tear up the government 's controversial fixed term parliaments act which means general elections take place only once every five years			1
former minister sir @entity0 today calls for a cross-party deal to repeal the legislation , branding it a ‘ recipe for political horse - trading and coalition manoeuvrings ’			1
he is the most senior mp to demand that the law – which will make it all but impossible for either mr @entity2 or @entity18 leader @entity17 to run a minority government if they fail to win a @entity21 majority next year – is scrapped			1
writing for the @entity22 , he warns it could also lead to repeated changes of government between 2015 and 2020 without voters having any say			1
‘ all parties should now combine to repeal the @entity31 , making the change effective from the day after next may ’s election , ’ sir @entity0 , an international development minister until this summer ’s reshuffle , insists			1
critics say few appreciated the long - term impact of the constitutional change , which was introduced to ensure one of the coalition parties could not walk out on the other and prompt an election			1
it means prime ministers no longer have the power to go to the @entity44 to ask her to call an election when opinion polls are favourable			2
instead , they need to win the support of a ' supermajority ' of two - thirds of mps for an election to be held at any time outside of a five - year fixed period - meaning the leader of a minority administration would never be able to go to the polls without the backing of his or her opponents			1
the only other way to trigger an election as the law stands is if a government loses a vote on a formal motion of no confidence			1
but other parties then have a two - week period during which they have the opportunity to stitch together a pact to govern before an election is held			1
a new coalition could therefore take power without any election taking place			2
critics say the legislation , cooked up to keep the current coalition together , has ended up being a recipe for never - ending power - sharing government			1
the @entity31 has also been widely criticised for creating a ' zombie parliament ' with little left to do before may 's general election			2
sir @entity0 warns the sense that current coalition ‘ was negotiated behind closed doors will be nothing compared to the public anger if coalitions are formed , broken and re-formed within the five year term of a @entity86 without any new election taking place to give them legitimacy ’			1
‘ even one academic article on the subject believed that the @entity44 retained some discretionary powers in respect of dissolution			0
‘ prime ministerial discretion is not involved			0
the prerogative power in respect of calling an election is gone			2
@entity44 retains no discretionary powers			0
‘ under the @entity31 , the provisions are to be reviewed in 2020			0
however , given the criticisms now being directed at the measure , pressure for some change may become such as to prompt some change			0
’ veteran conservative mp sir @entity122 agreed his party should commit to scrapping the legislation			1
' we 've never had fixed term parliaments in the past and it creates terrible inflexibility			1
' it was created artificially just for the sake of the current coalition , supposedly to stop one party walking off , rather than any good constitutional innovation			2
five - year parliaments are too long			1
' the growing realisation at @entity138 that mr @entity2 and his @entity140 deputy @entity139 have overseen constitutional changes that ensure future coalitions are far more likely will anger some mps who had not appreciated their long - term implications			2
some senior @entity145 , including at least two cabinet ministers , believe mr @entity2 should have run a minority government after failing to win an outright majority in may 2010 and gone back to the country in a second election in october of that year			1
one conservative mp sceptical about the coalition said : ' the coalition was a mistake in the first place , and now @entity2 and @entity139 are going to leave behind a law tying the hands of future party leaders			1
' sir @entity0 warns that while the agreement to stay the course has served the country well , a permanent constitutional change will not a short term fix can do long term damage			1
so it is with the decision to introduce fixed - term five year parliamentary sessions			1
it might be good for now : but it ’s bad for the future			0
until recently general elections were governed by the @entity172 , which allowed for a maximum @entity174 term of five years			0
crucially , though , it afforded the sitting prime minister the authority to call an election at any time			2
the @entity180 changed this to a rigid five year term , with no easy mechanism for shortening it			2
consequently , everyone has known for years that the date of the next election will be 7th may 2015			0
the prime minister ’s power to dissolve @entity86 under the historic @entity190 has lapsed			0
the new fixed term of five years can only be curtailed if two thirds of mps vote for dissolution , or if the @entity195 passes a vote of no confidence in one @entity198 , but fails to pass a vote of confidence in an alternative one within a fortnight			1
we can all see why this was agreed			0
the only way a viable government could be formed after the 2010 election was for conservatives and @entity208 @entity140 to join as one to create a parliamentary majority			1
the @entity140 needed to guard against being wrong - footed by a @entity211 prime minister exercising his historic right to pick the election date and choosing to do so at the worst time for the @entity140			1
a deal to agree how long the government should last was an essential part of the glue which bound the @entity96 together			2
the agreement to stay the course has served the country well , but a permanent constitutional change will not			0
a fixed term in office and pre-determined election dates might suit a @entity226			1
they do not in normal circumstances suit a @entity86			0
unlike a @entity226 , where that top person remains one and the same , @entity86 is an organic institution : its characteristics and composition can change in the course of one year , let alone five			0
some mps will die or resign , others may cross the floor			0
in the course of our history parties have split or merged			0
between elections the nature of @entity86 , which underpins the energies and legitimacy of a government , can change dramatically			0
the pressures and changes in the @entity21 can be at their most acute when there is a tiny majority for the government of the day or , worse , no straightforward majority at all			0
there have been many such occasions in our history , when it has been best for the country to have a general election at moments which would have been impossible if we had fixed - term @entity260			1
after the february 1974 election @entity261 tried unsuccessfully to hang on as prime minister , before accepting the arithmetic was against him			2
the @entity266 government that took over felt obliged to return to the polls just a few months later , achieving a wafer thin majority			0
@entity271 ’s government fell once the @entity273 and @entity274 nationalists deserted the @entity198 after the devolution referendums of 1979			0
@entity276 governed with a very slim majority between 1992 and 1997 with by - election defeats making the government live on an ever sharper knife edge			1
the point is that all these prime ministers had the option , when the make - up of @entity86 changed , to pull the plug and seek a stronger mandate from the voters			0
even when they chose not to , the @entity195 had the power to force their hand with a simple @entity290 , as in 1979			0
( clockwise from top left ) former prime ministers @entity261 , @entity266 , @entity271 and @entity276 had the option to call an election and seek a stronger mandate from voters the @entity31 , however , erects new hurdles that make it harder to dissolve @entity86 mid-way through its term			2
as a result , it is a recipe for political horse - trading and coalition manoeuvrings			2
this will weaken , not strengthen , public confidence in our politics			0
the sense that the current @entity96 was negotiated behind closed doors will be nothing compared to the public anger if coalitions are formed , broken and re-formed within the five year term of a @entity86 without any new election taking place to give them legitimacy			1
for if the government were to lose a vote of no confidence , the prime minister could no longer call an election and dissolve @entity86			1
now , the @entity324 would have the chance to cobble together its own majority by wooing potential partners			0
all this would happen hidden from view in the corridors of @entity138 , with the ballot box nowhere in sight			0
in this scenario the leader of a smaller party , acting as kingmaker , could simply walk away from their coalition partner and prop up the @entity324 , without the trouble of asking any voter for their opinion			0
these are the unintended permanent consequences of an act designed to fix a temporary problem			0
it is in every party ’s interests and every voter ’s interests to have strong , accountable government			0
to do so , all parties should now combine to repeal the @entity31 , making the change effective from the day after next may ’s election			2
if we do n’t do this we will all regret having to live with a law suitable for holding together one term of @entity86 , but wholly inappropriate for all of those which follow .			2
