by @entity0 this is the touching moment the mother of one of @entity5 ’s youngest surviving babies got to hold her daughter for the first time			0
@entity8 said cuddling and kissing baby @entity9 - born at 24 weeks - was ‘ the best moment of my life ’			1
ms @entity8 , 34 , from @entity12 , in the @entity13 , enjoyed a precious 20 minutes with her daughter on @entity15			1
@entity8 held her baby , @entity9 , for the first time on sunday			1
@entity9 was born at 24 weeks and weighing just 1lb 3oz			1
until now , she had been too vulnerable to be held @entity9 was so premature that when she was born it would still have been legal for her to be aborted @entity9 , who weighed just 1lb 3oz when she was born on february 27 , was so premature she could legally have been aborted			1
but after receiving ‘ fantastic ’ care at the @entity20 of @entity21 , she is thriving and now weighs just over 1lb 10oz			1
the mother - of - four admitted she was physically sick on sunday morning because she was so worried something might go wrong when @entity9 was taken out of her incubator			2
but the planned 10 minute cuddle was stretched to 20 minutes because @entity9 responded so well to her mother ’s touch , maintaining an even heart rate and temperature throughout			2
a delighted ms @entity8 said : ‘ i ’ve waited for over a month to be able to hold her and it is something i will remember for the rest of my life			1
@entity9 is now a month old and 1lb 10oz			1
she was briefly able to breathe on her own but now needs ventilation ‘ i cried before the nurse even took her out , it was so emotional , i ’ve never experienced anything like it before			0
‘ she snuggled up to my chest and fell asleep , the nurses kept checking her heartbeat and temperature and they were fine so i got longer with her than expected			0
’ ms @entity8 added : ‘ it was very scary			2
she is so tiny , she can fit in the palm of your hand			0
i was scared something might go wrong but she coped really well			0
‘ actually holding her was quite a shock because it was only then that i realised just how tiny she is			0
‘ to me she is perfect and i ’m very lucky			0
’ @entity9 is being carefully watched and kept in a special incubator			2
ms @entity8 was able to hold @entity9 for 20 minutes as she maintained her temperature and heart rate well ms @entity8 said : ' she snuggled up to my chest and fell asleep , the nurses kept checking her heartbeat and temperature and they were fine so i got longer with her than expected ' her father , @entity55 , was not able to visit his daughter on sunday because the couple could not find anyone to look after their other children			1
they have to spend more than £ 110 a week making the 100 mile round trip to the hospital , parking , and paying for childcare			0
kind - hearted members of the public are already donating towards the cost of visiting @entity9			2
ms @entity8 said : ‘ she came so early that any money we had saved has now been spent			0
at this moment we are having to choose between petrol and food			0
’ ms @entity8 arrived at the hospital with just minutes to spare before @entity9 was born after a four hour labour			1
@entity9 's parents have to make a 100 mile round trip to visit her in hospital @entity9 's father , @entity78 , was unable to see her on sunday as he could n't find anyone to look after their other children after the birth , @entity9 was rushed straight off to the neonatal unit and placed in an incubator			0
at three - days - old , @entity9 was able to breathe by herself and doctors put her on a lower dependency @entity87 ( continuous positive airway pressure ) machine			1
but ten days later , she started to struggle so doctors were forced to ventilate her again , a necessity not uncommon with babies born before 29 weeks			2
the couple have been sharing @entity9 ’s journey on a @entity94 page , uploading photographs and daily updates on @entity9 ’s condition , receiving messages of support from all over the world			0
