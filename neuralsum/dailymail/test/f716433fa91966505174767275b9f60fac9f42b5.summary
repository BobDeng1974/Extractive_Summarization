@entity0 is ready to be the bull to @entity3 's matador when the middleweights collide in @entity5 on saturday			1
the @entity6 is bidding for his fourth consecutive victory since losing to @entity8 two years ago and has a title shot in his sights			1
and he knows exactly what it will take to beat @entity3			1
@entity3 ( left ) and @entity0 face off ahead of their middleweight clash this weekend ' a big set of balls			1
i 've just got to come forward and go out there and dominate him , ' he said			1
' @entity3 likes to run around and dance and do his thing			1
i 've just got to cut him off , slowly progress and be the bull			2
he tries to be the matador – sometimes you 've got to play one role or the other and this is the time to be the bull and slowly progress , put him in a bad spot and make him fight my fight			2
' i 've seen little things that he does n't like – there 's plenty of other fights too that i 've seen that show a lot of holes and areas where i can take advantage of			2
' you see fights where guys stand in the middle ground too long – i 've just got to make him think about everything			2
i 'm a true mixed martial artist ; i have everything to my game			2
he 's got to think about me taking him down , and then my kicks and my punches and everything that i bring to the table			0
' @entity3 has got a very small avenue to win this fight on the feet			1
other than that , my avenue is quite big comparably to his			0
. he does n't really have much of a chance on the ground			0
@entity0 performs during an open workout as he bids to extend his winning streak to five @entity3 lands a side kick as he works out in front of fans and media ' i 'll be operating at a different frequency than him – he does n't have the hip movement and the speed to keep up with me			1
' and while @entity0 afforded @entity3 his respect , he has no plans to let it get in the way of victory			1
' i think there is a mutual respect between @entity3 and me – i respect what he does , ' he said			1
' he 's one of the best in the game and has been for a long , long time			0
' he 's right here at the top , where he 's been for the whole of his career			0
he 's a martial artist – he lives by the code			0
a lot of people love his fighting style , a lot of people hate his fighting style , but you have to respect his fighting style			0
' i respect what he does and i like a lot of the things he does			0
but at the same time , i 'm going to go out there and show him my style and dominate			2
' i 've been running marathons every day so i 'm ready to go in there and chase him down			0
' @entity100 's last victory came against @entity101 last november in @entity102 @entity3 is also coming off the back of a victory , against @entity105 in @entity106 @entity3 , meanwhile , is confident he can upset @entity0 and earn himself a title shot			1
' i think if i apply my style , my technique , i can stop @entity0 , you know , ' he said			1
' if i can do my strategy , i can win the fight			2
' i know there was another fight in line for the title shot - jacare vs @entity117 – but now , whoever wins out of me and @entity0 – deserves a title shot i think			1
' i can see a couple of weaknesses in @entity0 but it 's hard to say before the fight , it 's hard to foresee the fight			1
i have to be there to feel the fight - to see any mistakes he makes			0
' i am very well prepared for this fight			0
i had eight weeks of camp and i had great training			0
@entity133 [ @entity134 ] was there and many , many other fighters			0
so i am feeling very well , very calm , and i think i can do a great job			0
