a person ’s home is their castle and they populate it with their own subjects - millions and millions of bacteria			1
scientists have found that when we move from one house to another – or even spend time in a hotel - we take all of our bacteria with us , and ' colonise ' the space around us within a matter of hours			1
these ‘ bacterial signatures ’ are unique and could be used to uncover crimes in future , just as today ’s investigators rely on fingerprints			1
the @entity37 followed seven families - comprising 18 people , three dogs and one cat - over the course of six weeks			0
the participants in the study swabbed their hands , feet and noses daily to collect a sample of the microbial populations living in and on them			0
they also sampled surfaces in the house , including doorknobs , light switches , floors and countertops			0
researchers at the lab analysed the dna of the samples to characterise the different species of microbes in each sample , according to the study published in @entity64			2
they found that people substantially affected the microbial communities in a house			2
when three of the families moved , it took less than a day for the new house to look just like the old one in the way it was covered in microbes			2

a stock image of ' superbug ' microbes is pictured dr @entity86 said that microbiome studies could serve as a forensic tool			1
given an unidentified sample from a floor in this study he said , ‘ we could easily predict which family it came from			0
’ because a microbial community shifts in a matter of days when a person leaves a location , he said : ‘ you could theoretically predict whether a person has lived in this location , and how recently , with very good accuracy			0
’ dr @entity86 believes this technique could be more sophisticated than fingerprints			2
he said that scientists could look at bacterial colonies to identify the last person to come into contact with a person and when it happened			1
an actual fingerprint is rarely left on a body , but a microbial fingerprint certainly is , ’ he added			0
they found that couples and their young children shared most of their microbial community and that regular physical contact made a difference in how bacteria spread			1
people ’s hands were the most likely to have similar microbes , while their noses showed the most individual variation			1
perhaps unsurprisingly , more plant and soil bacteria was found in houses containing dogs and cats			1
the research suggests that when a person , and their microbes , leave a house , the microbial community shifts noticeably in a matter of days			2
@entity86 , a microbiologist at @entity31 , said that the effects are more extreme in hotels			1
‘ everyone thinks hotels are icky , but when one young couple we studied moved into a hotel , it was microbiologically identical to their home within 24 hours , ’ he told the @entity140			1
' no matter what you do to clean a hotel room			0
your microbial signal has wiped out basically every trace of the previous resident within hours			0

dr @entity86 believes that parents in the future could raise their children in homes full of healthier microbes			0
the human microbiome is in a state of flux before the age of two and the ' wrong ' sort of bacteria can impact physical and mental development			0
more research on how microbes move around , could mean that parents could expose their children to a greater microbial community			1
he continued that dogs act as a useful conduit for bringing in microbes from the outdoors			0
many scientists believe that more bacteria are good for us and that some can prevent allergies			1
in the future it may be possible to engineer environments to circulate good bacteria so children could be set up for healthy lives .			0

scientists from the @entity30 @entity32 ’s @entity31 examined the interaction between humans and the microbes that live on us
they found that we move locations , we take our bacteria with us
hotel rooms can be colonised with personal microbes within hours
*experts* say the bacterial signatures are unique and could be used by forensic scientists to identify criminals , instead of fingerprints
