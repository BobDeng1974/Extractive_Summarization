he has also spent time teaching in @entity21 , @entity22 and the desert kingdom of @entity24 , but says he returned home as he wants to live in the @entity26			1
all this has meant he has been forced to dig deep into his savings to pay the rent and other bills			0
' everyone i 've spoken to - people in business , the job centre , my friends and family just do n't know why i do n't even get interviews			1
' the sheer fact i have moved three times to work should imply i am eager to work			0
' it 's hard to blame anyone without being able to put my finger on the issue in the first place			0
' searching : mr @entity0 has a geography degree and three a-levels , but has not even been called for interview mr @entity0 initially wanted to find a job related to his degree , specifically employment within the environmental or town planning sectors			1

' my cv has been redone by three or four different people			2

i even applied for a job as a train driver , just because it was there			1
' i feel awful thinking i have a lot to offer but no one wants to use me			0
it 's frustrating , upsetting			0
if i was very blas√© it would be a whole different story			0
' he added : ' my job centre told me ages ago i was caught in a @entity99 , saying i was over-qualified for a factory - type job but under - experienced for the kind of job i wanted to do			2
