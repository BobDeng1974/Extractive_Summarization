by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 it 's the sight you never thought you 'd see			0
@entity5 dumping a bucket of ice and water on his head all in the name of fun and charity			1
well , @entity14 dumping a bucket of ice and water on his head to be precise			2
fresh from their appearance together on @entity19 with @entity20 , golf 's two current superstars are among the latest big names to brave the craze sweeping the world 's sporting celebrities : the ice bucket challenge			1
it is all in aid of raising awareness of motor neurone disease and anyone not completing the challenge must donate money to the @entity58 , according to the rules of the game			1
once upon a time the prospect of @entity5 taking part in the challenge would have been unthinkable			0
famously a lone wolf , @entity5 never showed any public signs of being anything other than the steely - eyed , fist - pumping golfing machine that has racked up 14 major titles and shattered records at every turn			0
but , if ever there was a sign that times have changed , here it is			0
@entity5 and @entity14 , seemingly heir to @entity5 's crown as the world 's most brilliant golfer following his wins at @entity78 and the @entity79 this summer , were game contestants and laughed heartily at their discomfort			2
and , unlike events on the course recently , if there were a winner from this contest it was certainly @entity5 , who left his friend and rival utterly soaked and shivering , while @entity14 somehow managed to fill up @entity5 's bucket with even more water during his attempt			1
fellow golfers @entity94 and @entity96 were among the first sports stars to freeze themselves in the name of charity last month , and @entity96 laid down the challenge to @entity5 then			0
it seems the former world no 1 has finally accepted			0
we will wait with interest to see whether @entity14 's nominations accept his challenge			2
they are @entity108 , actress @entity109 and @entity110			1
there ca n't be a person in the world not wanting to see that particular ice bucket challenge			1
