published : 12:11 est , 27 december 2012 updated : 11:08 est , 31 december 2012 dolphins in a popular @entity2 resort have been spotted giving presents to human visitors			1
researchers revealed the astonishing find in a new research paper analysing the animals at the @entity9 in @entity2			2
on 23 occasions over the past several years , wild dolphins were observed giving gifts to humans , including eels , tuna , squid , and even an octopus			1
researchers found 23 occurences of dolphins giving humans gifts including fins and even an octopus ' gift giving has become an established but infrequent part of the culture of the provisioned dolphins at @entity9 , ' the researchers say in a paper pushed in the journal @entity34 : a @entity35			1
the wild dolphins that were observed giving gifts to human in @entity2 were regular visitors to a provisioning program at the @entity9 which began in 1992			1
each evening staff members from the resort wade into the ocean to feed the wild dolphins fish			2
in 1998 , an adult male dolphin named @entity45 was observed giving a dead moray eel to one of the staff members			0
since then , staff members have documented an additional 22 other events			0
' since july 1998 , biologists managing the program have documented 23 occurrences of ' giftgiving , ' when several of the provisioned dolphins have offered wild - caught cephalopod or fin fish species to staff members , ' the researchers wrote			2
@entity45 , the first dolphin recorded giving gifts to a human at the resort tinkerbell and storm , two of the dolphins found to be bringing gifts to human handlers at the resort dolphins of a wide group of ages and both sexes engaged in the gift - giving behavior , and scientists are not entirely sure of what is motivating their behavior			0
food sharing in animals is often motivated by an urge to play , a desire to reciprocate food sharing or the belief that the recipient of the food is an incompetent hunter , they claim			0
based on their detailed observations , the scientists think that gift giving among the wild dolphins at the @entity9 was likely a form of play behavior			1
' gift giving may occur either as a discreet behavior ( that may be a sequel to one or more other behaviors such as play or food preparation ) , or as a part of other behaviors , such as play and / or food sharing , ' the team , @entity92 and @entity93 of the @entity94 in @entity95 , said			0
' it is most likely a manifestation of the particular relationship between the provisioned dolphinsand the human participants in the provisioning			0
' gift giving has become an established but infrequent part of the culture of the provisioned dolphins at @entity9			1
' the resort is well known for its dolphin encounters , where the wild animals come to the beach .			0

wild dolphins in the @entity9 in @entity2 were spotted gift giving 23 times
gifts included eels , tuna , squid and an octopus
researchers say gift giving between species is *extremely* rare
