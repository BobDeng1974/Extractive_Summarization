lost in translation : a @entity3 women 's group launched a campaign to find a word for female masturbation in @entity3 there is no commonly accepted word for female masturbation , so the country 's sex education group has launched a competition to establish one			1
the @entity13 ( @entity14 ) – an organisation that promotes an ' open , positive view of sex and relationship issues ' – has so far received more than a thousand suggestions after launching the contest earlier this month			1
top suggestions so far include ' @entity21 ' , ' pulla ' and ' selfa '			1
@entity23 , a spokeswoman for the association , hopes the competition will encourage healthy discussions about sexuality			1
she told @entity28 : ' rather than sit around amongst ourselves talking about it , we thought we would launch a nationwide competition			2
' we are trying to put sexuality on the agenda - the positive aspects , not just the negative ones like sexual abuse			1
we want to focus on the good parts , the lust '			2
' when it comes to masturbation , people mostly think about just men doing it and we do n't think of it as common for women			1
if we do n't have a word in the language , how can we even talk about it ? ' the contest follows news that researchers have discovered that although many women assume they know exactly what turns them on , their brains and their lady bits often disagree			1
scientists at @entity59 's @entity58 in @entity60 , @entity61 , and @entity62 , used a ' vaginal photoplethysmograph ' - a small glass tampon - shaped instrument that measures sexual arousal by blood flow - to demonstrate this mind - body disconnect			2
writer @entity69 , 33 , based in @entity70 , underwent the test herself and discovered some surprising discrepancies between what she believed she found sexy , and what her nether regions responded to			0
' i 've always thought of myself as self - aware sexually , ' miss @entity69 writes for @entity77			0
' i consider myself a non-judgmental heterosexual woman who enjoys various positions and toys and is open to the possibility of a threesome if the urge strikes			1
' in the interests of the experiment , miss @entity69 was required to insert the probe into her vagina and seat herself on a leather chair while various erotic and non-erotic video clips were played before her			0
@entity93 , phd - whose work in sexual pleasure has reportedly earned him the monkier dr. @entity95 - and evolutionary biologist @entity98 , phd , both leading the study , were controlling the videos from a separate room			0
campaign : the most popular suggestions submitted have been ' @entity21 ' , ' pulla ' and ' selfa ' ' the probe looked and felt like a glass tampon , so it was easy to forget that it was inside me , ' miss @entity69 tells @entity109			1
the device , she explains , measures blood flow to the surrounding tissue , or the ' pulse ' of the vagina , which indicates arousal			0
' it was definitely a challenge to stay still , but overall i was comfortable			0
since i was focused on watching porn , any discomfort i might have felt was probably eclipsed by the graphic imagery inches from my face			0
' as dr @entity93 explains , arousal is made up from a balance between two brain systems ; sexual excitation , ' your gas pedal ' , and sexual inhibition , ' your breaks '			0
miss @entity69 was exposed to wide range of visual stimuli ; from ' neutralizing ' kitten videos and scenes from uplifting films , to hard - core porn and a disturbing clip from @entity137			0
for each video , she was asked to rate her emotional responses - excitement , relaxation , fright , sadness , guilt and shame , for example - on a five - point scale			0
miss @entity69 then told researchers , off the top of her head , that she was generally aroused by concepts including lesbian sex , a threesome and female masturbation			1
she also declared some concepts that she did n't consider arousing ; homosexual male sex , foot fetishism and bonobo monkeys mating , for example			1
after sourcing video clips relevant to miss @entity69 's preferences , she was invited to view them and rate how aroused each clip made her feel on a scale of one to ten			2
this created some mental conflicts			0
' as a proponent of gay rights , for instance , i wanted to be turned on by sex between men , but i found the sight of two erect penises off - putting			2
' and as much as i wanted to believe that neither animals nor feet could excite me , i had to concede a minimal level of attraction to both			0

@entity14 promotes an ' open , positive view of sex and relationship issues '
spokeswoman said : ' if we do n't have a word , how can we talk about it ? '
the group has received more than a thousand suggestions in last month
the most popular words submitted so far are ' @entity21 ' , ' pulla ' and ' selfa '
