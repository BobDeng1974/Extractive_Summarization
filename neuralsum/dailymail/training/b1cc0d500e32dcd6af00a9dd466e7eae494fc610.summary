scientists claim to have shed light on how dinosaurs divided up their meals allowing them to co-exist in harsh prehistoric ecosystems			2
large , long - necked plant - eating dinosaurs , such as @entity6 , dominated the land between 210 million and 65 million years ago and would have need huge amounts of food			1
these sauropods were the largest land animals of all time , with the biggest weighing 80 tonnes - more than 11 elephants			2
by analysing dinosaur skulls , scientists claim to have shed light on how dinosaurs divided up their meals allowing them to co-exist in harsh prehistoric ecosystems			1
pictured is a completed skull model of the @entity21 sauropod dinosaur @entity22 researchers from the @entity24 and the @entity25 in @entity26 believe that multiple sauropod species survived in the same habitats because of their different diets			1
the @entity30 - a distinctive sequence of sedimentary rock in the western @entity34 - contained more than 10 species of sauropod			1
in comparison , the highly diverse faunas seen in modern @entity37 only support one gigantic species , the elephant			2
experts studied a digital reconstruction of the skulls , jaws and neck muscles of the sauropods @entity22 and @entity6 to investigate how they fed. this gif reveals the constructed skull from various angles			1
researchers were able to use models , such as this , to determine teeth size and structure the @entity24 and the @entity25 in @entity26 analysed sauropod skulls found in the @entity56 ( shown ) , which extends throughout @entity57 experts studied a digital reconstruction of the skulls , jaws and neck muscles of the sauropods @entity22 ( left ) and @entity6 ( right ) to investigate how they fed. the top skulls in this image have a reconstructed jaw ( in multiple colours )			1
in the bottom image , hotter colours refer to areas of higher stress when biting @entity72 , a phd student at @entity74 's @entity73 , said : ' our results show that although neither could chew , the skulls of both dinosaurs were sophisticated cropping tools			2
' @entity22 had a robust skull and strong bite , which would have allowed it to feed on tough leaves and branches			1
' meanwhile , the weaker bite and more delicate skull of @entity6 would have restricted it to softer foods like ferns			1
its fossilised right shinbone ( right ) and left hipbone ( bottom ) were found together and analysis showed the animal was different to other species found a primitive meat - eating dinosaur that roamed the @entity99 about 200 million years ago has been dug up in @entity100			0
the new species , about the size of a lion and found high up in the @entity104 , was an ancestor of @entity106 , velociraptor and @entity108			0
more than 6ft ( 1.8 metres ) long , it is one of the few dinosaurs ever recovered from northern @entity100 , and the first carnivorous member of the group discovered in @entity113			0
at the time all the planet ’s landmass was wrapped up in one supercontinent @entity117 surrounded by a giant ocean and was just beginning to break up into the modern continents we now see today			0
named @entity123 admirabilis after @entity124 where it was unearthed , it was a predator theropod but would probably have snacked on the abundant ferns as well			0
@entity127 was around at the beginning of the period known geologically as the @entity130 , and helps explain the spread of carvivorous dinosaurs following the @entity134 mass extinction shortly before			0
half the world ’s animals were mysteriously wiped out by either climate change , volcanic eruptions or an asteroid impact			0
its fossilised right shinbone and left hipbone were found together and analysis showed the animal was different to other species found , the study published in the journal @entity142 said			0
' however , @entity6 could also have used its strong neck muscles to help it detach plant material through movements of the head			1
' this indicates differences in diet between the two dinosaurs , which would have allowed them to co-exist			0
' the researchers also used a series of biomechanical measurements from other sauropod species to calculate the difference in movement in their skulls and jaws			1
they found that other @entity56 sauropods were also highly varied in feeding adaptations , which suggests they had different diets			2
large , long - necked plant - eating dinosaurs , such as @entity6 ( artist 's impression pictured ) , dominated the land between 210 million and 65 million years ago and would have need huge amounts of food professor @entity175 of the @entity24 , co-author of the report , said : ' in modern animal communities differences in diet such as this - termed dietary niche partitioning - allow multiple similar species to co-exist by reducing competition for food			1
' although dietary niche partitioning has been suspected between @entity56 sauropods based on their structural features and patterns of tooth - wear , this is the first study to provide strong , numerical , biomechanical evidence for its presence in this fossil community			0
' co-author professor @entity192 of the @entity25 added : ' our study provides insight not only into the ecology of dinosaurs but more generally into the mechanisms supporting species - richness in other animal communities , both from the fossil record and in the present day			0
' the research , funded by the @entity203 , was published in the journal @entity204			0

sauropod species survived in same habitats because of different diets
experts studied a reconstruction of the skulls , jaws and neck muscles of the sauropods @entity22 and @entity6 to investigate how they fed
@entity22 had a trough bite , allowing it to feed on tough leaves
the weaker bite of @entity6 would have restricted it to softer foods
