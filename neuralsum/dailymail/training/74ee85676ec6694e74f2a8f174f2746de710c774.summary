much has changed in the past 20 years , but one thing that has n't is @entity2 's knack for perplexing the visitor			1
last tuesday , tourists who had journeyed tens of thousands of miles from rural @entity6 , urban @entity7 or remote @entity8 to absorb the wonders of the @entity11 museum found only one marvel for their delectation : a closed sign			2
on tuesdays , for reasons best known to itself , the @entity11 takes the day off ( most major @entity2 attractions close on either monday or tuesday )			1
last month @entity18 and @entity19 paid good money to have the @entity11 entirely to themselves for a visit with their daughter @entity22 ( a @entity24 was their highlight )			2
maybe they should simply have tried to sneak in on a tuesday - they 'd have saved themselves a lot of loot			2
this month marks the 20th anniversary of the @entity34 high - speed rail service between @entity35 and @entity2 a crowning glory : the @entity11 is more accessible thanks to the @entity34			1
just do n't go on a tuesday and in the area of dining out , @entity2 also continues to march to the beat of its own drum			2
in most countries in the world these days , any visitor to a capital city can bank on enjoying a meal whenever the mood takes them			2
not in @entity2 : bars , brasseries , restaurants and cafes dish out food only when the mood takes them			2
best of luck if you 're looking for a meal before 7.30pm			2
this month marks the 20th anniversary of the @entity34 high - speed rail service between @entity35 and @entity2 , which can take as little as two hours 15 minutes			1
i find that especially extraordinary because i travelled on the very first service ( along with a carriage load of @entity66 readers )			1
a changing of the guard : the @entity34 terminal has helped to revitalise @entity35 's grand old @entity71 station @entity72 - a fellow passenger - may know a thing or two about writing bestsellers , but when it came to using a @entity77 payphone he was absolutely hopeless			1
one of my abiding memories of travelling on that inaugural @entity34 service on november 14 , 1994 was standing with @entity72 on the concourse at @entity81 , and having to show him how to make a phone call home			1
' @entity87 , merci , ' he kept saying to me , clearly labouring under the misapprehension i was a helpful local ( there may well be helpful locals in @entity2 , but i 've yet to meet one ! )			2
back to the source : @entity90 travelled on the first @entity34 service in november 1994 ( left ) ; @entity2 's excellent @entity92 ( right ) has just reopened in the @entity93 after five years of refurbishment there were other ' celebs ' on the train but the only other one i can recall was the late @entity100			1
in truth the launch of @entity34 was a bit of a damp squib			1
the service should have begun in may that year but had to be delayed			1
its inaugural journey took place in the same week as the start of the @entity110 ( and shortly after peace broke out in @entity112 , further eclipsing the @entity113 )			2
looking back , one might have expected the incredible engineering achievement of the @entity113 - for the first time linking the @entity116 with the @entity117 - to have hogged the headlines			2
the sudden prospect of peace and people like you and me becoming instant millionaires proved rather more thrilling to news editors , however			2
full speed ahead : the advent of the @entity34 service means that @entity35 and @entity2 are not just two hours apart iconic : @entity129 's @entity71 sculpture ' @entity130 ' is now a recognisable part of a @entity34 journey and over the past 20 years the @entity113 has never captured the hearts of the @entity116 public in the way , for example , that another @entity77 project did : @entity138			1
both were money pits but while @entity138 ( about £ 1billion ) proved an enormous commercial flop , the @entity113 ( about £ 5billion ) has , albeit only in recent years , been more of a success			1
by the time i travelled on the inaugural service , i had already been through the @entity146 , travelling twice on a ' preview ' of the clumsily titled @entity149 service for cars			1
and a few years before the start of passenger rail services , i had been through the @entity113 when it was just a hole in the ground			1
invited by @entity157 's commercial director , @entity156 , to join the then transport minister @entity158 on an unprecedented adventure , we descended to the @entity113 entrance in @entity161 via a lift			1
exclusive access : @entity18 and @entity19 were in @entity2 last month , and paid for a private viewing at the @entity11 at the bottom we climbed aboard a primitive workman 's train for a slow ride through what was to become the service tunnel			1
at the halfway point , we reached a padlocked gate that marked the frontier between @entity116 and @entity174			2
someone was on hand to unlock it : here we left the @entity116 train to board a @entity77 one which continued to @entity181 , where a lift took us back up to the surface for a hovercraft ride home			0
i had seen the future of travel to the @entity117 and it worked			0
apres moi , i might have said , le deluge			0
who could fail to be excited by this major advance in foreign travel ? sadly , rather a lot of people			1
in pre-steam days 200 years ago , getting from @entity35 to @entity2 was an uncertain business : a journey that could be counted in days rather than hours			1
if the wind was really playing up , you would n't get to @entity174 at all			0
even the introduction of steam ships in the mid- @entity201 did n't make the journey much better			0
a long train journey from @entity35 , a longer rail trip on the other side of the @entity206			0
in the @entity211 era , the first class @entity208 from @entity209 to @entity2 took at least six hours , often much longer			0
that hardly compares with @entity34 's @entity71 to @entity81 in just over two hours			1
a towering attraction : @entity2 sights such as the @entity215 are now within day - trip range of @entity35 my first trip to @entity174 in 1962 was on a worn - out car ferry from @entity220 to @entity221			0
i fell in love with @entity2 on that visit and , over the years , while having had plenty of reasons to abandon the relationship ( the worst public row i have ever had in my life was with a ticket seller at the @entity11 ) , i have remained steadfast			1
in truth , @entity2 has had its share of ups and downs in the past 50 years			2
the city began a period of reinvention with the opening of the @entity238 , followed by a vigorous period of reconstruction leading up to the 200th anniversary of the @entity242 in 1989 , which saw the building of the famous @entity11 pyramid , the opening of the @entity246 and the @entity247			0
and the city had pointed the way towards urban regeneration with the redevelopment of @entity252			0
after this frantic rebuilding , it seemed that @entity2 ran out of steam			0
during the past 20 years , it is @entity35 that has been the hotbed of reconstruction and redevelopment - including that shining star for @entity34 passengers : @entity71			1
@entity263 boss @entity262 spoke an uncomfortable truth when he described @entity174 as ' a country in decline ' and called the @entity81 ' the squalor pit of @entity268 '			0
the @entity270 system 20 years ago felt modern and efficient ; today it seems chaotic and a bit seedy			1
but contrary to mr street 's view , @entity2 is showing many signs of recovery			0
always a pleasure : @entity2 may not have changed much in the last 20 years - but its scenery hardly needs to new hotels are opening at a pace - including the @entity282 , @entity283 , @entity284 , @entity285 , @entity286			1
( the @entity287 recently reopened , while two old favourites , the @entity289 and the @entity290 , are currently undergoing lavish refurbishments )			0
after a five - year closure , the city 's @entity92 has reopened			0
also open again is the modern art collection of the @entity295 , a stone 's - throw from the @entity215 , which is celebrating its new ( underwhelming ) glass floor			0
much more impressive is @entity300 's wonderful @entity299 art gallery , which has opened in the @entity301			0
@entity2 's charm , however , lies in its small things			0
the main one is that it is a place of manageable proportions			0
@entity2 has just two million people , a quarter the size of @entity35			0
it 's estimated that at any one time , for every @entity2 you 'll see on the streets , there are three tourists			0
because of its size , you can walk everywhere : from the @entity238 to the @entity215 is about three miles - a stroll of less than an hour			0
your walk will take longer because , inevitably , you will be sidetracked by a shop , a bar , a cafe or a marker explaining the history of a site you are passing			0
twenty years ago , leaving @entity72 to his phone call , i jumped in a taxi and travelled the short distance to @entity327 and gazed across the city from the @entity329			1
i was probably the first person ever to have enjoyed this view after travelling from @entity35 all the way by train			0
that sense of excitement has never gone away			0
i encourage you to discover it for yourself			0
@entity34 ( @entity337 , 08432 186186 ) offers return fares to @entity2 from £ 69 per person			1
this winter , @entity34 will operate fast services to @entity341 , changing at @entity342			1
next may it introduces direct services to @entity344 and , following the introduction of new trains , to @entity347 in late 2016			1
room rates at the gloriously situated @entity286 - on the @entity349 - start at £ 743 a night , with breakfast			0

the @entity34 service launched almost 20 years ago in november 1994
it took a while to become a success , but is not a major transport route
the service is set to be *expanded* , with trains to @entity344 and @entity347
