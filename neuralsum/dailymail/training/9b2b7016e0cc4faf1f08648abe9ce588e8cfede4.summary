by @entity0 from an early age children are taught not to talk to strangers , but as adults should people be more chatty with people they do n’t know ? that ’s the case according to two researchers at the @entity8 , who say conversing with strangers can actually make people happier			1
in a study they found that when people were encouraged to talk with others on their commute they enjoyed their journey more , and vice versa for when they kept to themselves			1
is a stranger just a friend you have n't met ? researchers from the @entity8 asked commuters to socialise with people they did n't know for a small reward			1
they found that people who talked said that they enjoyed their trip more			1
however , people asked to predict the results thought the outcome would be opposite ' i think our results simply tell us that people are missing opportunities for social engagement that would be more rewarding than one might expect , ' he tells @entity38			1
' modern urban life creates many situations where strangers in close proximity to each other			2
' engaging one of those people in a quick conversation could make each of those situations surprisingly more pleasant			2
' these data suggest that if your goal is to be a little happier that you might otherwise be , or to turn an unpleasant situation ( like a commute on public transportation or a dull period in a waiting room ) into something more pleasant , then trying to get to know a fellow human being could be a useful strategy			0
' he also adds that although the research was done in the @entity61 he sees no reason why the same conclusions can not be applied to countries like the @entity65			0
the study was carried out by dr @entity67 and ms @entity68 from the @entity8			1
in @entity71 , @entity70 they gathered 100 commuters and split them into three groups , reports @entity74			0
one group was asked to talk to strangers , the next to stay silent and the third to act as normal , all in exchange for a complimentary $ 5 ( £ 3 ) @entity79 gift card			1
after the commute the volunteers were asked to assess how much they enjoyed their journey			2
those who had struck up a conversation with someone they did n’t know reported a more enjoyable commute			0
those who had sat in solitude , meanwhile , reported a less pleasurable journey and were even said to be feeling less productive			0
interestingly , the researchers also gathered another group of volunteers , but there were just asked to predict what they thought the results of the experiment would be , and not to take part themselves			1
they thought that those commuters who sat in silence would have a more enjoyable time , rather than those who spoke to others			2
are people missing chances to be happier by keeping to themselves on their commute ? ' human beings are social animals , ' say the researchers			1
' those who misunderstand the consequences of social interactions may not , in at least some contexts , be social enough for their own well - being ' the results of the study support other research into this area , namely that people can be stimulated by holding conversations with people they do n’t know			1
and many also believe that attempts to start up a conversation will be met with ridicule , but that has been shown in this experiment not to be the case with the average conservation lasting 14 minutes			0
in their paper the researchers ask : ‘ connecting with others increases happiness , but strangers in close proximity routinely ignore each other			2
why ? ’ they postulate that either ‘ solitude is a more positive experience than interacting with strangers , or people misunderstand the consequences of distant social connections			2
’ but they conclude , according to their research , that it is the latter that is the case and not the former			0
‘ the pleasure of connection seems contagious , ’ they continue			0
indeed , in a separate experiment participants who were spoken to in a laboratory waiting room said they had a more positive experience than those who were sat alone			0
‘ human beings are social animals , ’ say the researchers			0
‘ those who misunderstand the consequences of social interactions may not , in at least some contexts , be social enough for their own well - being			0

researchers from the @entity8 asked commuters to socialise
for a small reward they asked them to talk to strangers on their train
they found that people who talked said that they enjoyed their trip more
people asked to predict the results thought the outcome would be opposite
the study concludes we would be happier if we socialised with others more
