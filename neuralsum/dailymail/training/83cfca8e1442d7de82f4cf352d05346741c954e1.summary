by @entity0 @entity1 : 22:55 est , 16 december 2013 @entity2 : 04:15 est , 17 december 2013 ' ambassadors ' : sir @entity4 said @entity5 and @entity6 are ambassadors for @entity8 boy band @entity5 and @entity8 ’s @entity11 singer @entity6 now rival the @entity12 as key brand ambassadors for @entity8 , sir @entity4 said last night			1
the former prime minister said that @entity19 and his fellow bandmates , along with singer @entity21 , @entity16 football and shows such as @entity18 have increased ‘ trust ’ in the @entity8 around the world			1
sir @entity4 told a @entity26 committee investigating ‘ soft power ’ diplomacy that hard power , like the @entity29 , is now more difficult to use			1
he argued that @entity8 needs to cash in on advantages like the @entity33 language , the @entity34 and the @entity35 to make friends around the world			2
sir @entity4 said the @entity12 and some pop music figures are ‘ subliminal ’ reasons why foreigners like @entity8			1
‘ when people refer to the @entity12 they almost always mean our queen , ’ he said			0
‘ wherever you go @entity47 will be known and so , these days , will be @entity18			2
‘ all of these reflect a rather favourable impression on @entity8			2
we ’ve had over 20 @entity8 albums top the charts in countries around the world			0
it ’s not just the established stars like the @entity56 and the @entity57			0
‘ you have @entity21 , @entity5 , @entity6			2
wherever you go , they ’re household names and they have an implication for perception and thus soft power			1
that is a background that few countries can match in terms of profile and that is important for our diplomacy			0
because of these elements of soft power , and because of our history , there is ... a greater tendency to trust the @entity8 in diplomacy			1
’ earlier this month , @entity5 ’s third album , @entity77 , entered the @entity79 @entity78 at number one making them the only group to have their first three albums top the chart in their opening week			0
trust : former pm said arry @entity19 and his fellow bandmates , along with singer @entity21 , @entity6 , @entity16 football and shows like @entity18 have increased ' trust ' in the @entity8 around the world sir @entity4 also warned that @entity8 will be ‘ diminished ’ in the eyes of the world if the @entity8 leaves the @entity94 or @entity95 votes for independence			1
the former @entity98 prime minister said the @entity8 @entity100 and conservative ‘ europhobes ’ are damaging @entity8 abroad			1
‘ i have not a shred of doubt that we are better off in than out			0
to lose our biggest market would be folly on a grand scale			0
household name : @entity95 singer @entity6 was also held up as an example of a @entity8 ambassador ‘ there are people who trade under the banner of @entity114 but they want us out			2
whether they ’re in @entity116 or any other party , that is damaging			0
’ sir @entity4 , who began the discussions with the @entity120 that led to the @entity121 in @entity122 , warned that leaving the @entity94 would mean border controls between @entity122 and @entity124 that would ‘ unsettle ’ the local population and unpick the stability of the peace process			1
‘ @entity128 would have really legitimate cause to worry			0
’ sir @entity4 said that when he travels the world the prospect of @entity95 quitting the @entity8 and the @entity132 leaving the @entity94 were raised with him frequently			1
‘ if @entity95 were to vote for independence i think it would be bad for @entity95			0
it certainly would be bad for the @entity8			0
’ he said foreign leaders are ‘ baffled ’ about why @entity95 would leave			0
‘ they would perceive a country that was damaged and diminished if a chunk of it voluntarily chose to leave the @entity8			1
’ sir @entity4 also warned that @entity139 is wrong to say @entity95 could continue as a member of the @entity94			1
the belief that because they are in the @entity94 as part of the @entity8 , they would automatically be when they left is fallacy			2
‘ they would have to apply to rejoin at a time when the @entity94 is in no hurry about new members			2
i ’m sure they would get in but it would take them 10 years and who knows what conditions of entry they would get			0

also *included* @entity21 , @entity16 football and *tv* show @entity18
sir @entity4 spoke at @entity26 committee on ‘ soft power ’ diplomacy
he warned @entity8 will be ‘ diminished ’ if the @entity8 leaves the @entity94
