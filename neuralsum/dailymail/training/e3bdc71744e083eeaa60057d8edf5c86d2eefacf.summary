by @entity0 published : 09:55 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 09:55 est , 11 october 2013 a @entity2 farmer who discovered an oil spill the size of seven football fields while out harvesting wheat says that when he found it , crude was bubbling up out of the ground			1
farmer @entity10 said yesterday that he smelled the crude for days before the tires on his combines were coated in it			1
at the apparent break in the @entity16 's underground pipeline , the oil was ' spewing and bubbling six inches high , ' he said in a telephone interview yesterday			1
vacuum trucks pictured cleaning up the oil in near @entity19 , @entity2 - more than 20,000 barrels of crude oil have spewed out of a @entity16 oil pipeline in @entity10 's wheat field what @entity10 had found on september 29 turned out it was one of the largest spills recorded in the state			1
at 20,600 barrels , it was four times the size of a pipeline rupture in late march that forced the evacuation of more than 20 homes in @entity33			2
but it was 12 days after @entity10 reported the spill before state officials told the public what had happened , raising questions about how @entity2 , which is in the midst of an oil boom , reports such incidents			1
the spill happened in a remote area in the northwest corner of the state			0
the nearest home is a half - mile away , and @entity16 says no water sources were contaminated , no wildlife was hurt and no one was injured			2
the release of oil has been stopped , state environment geologist @entity52 said thursday			0
and the spill , spread out over 7.3 acres , or about the size of seven football fields , has been contained			1
@entity58 , who was helping @entity10 harvest his wheat crop , likened the september 29 discovery to the theme song from @entity63 television show			2
what @entity10 had found on sept. 29 turned out it was one of the largest spills recorded in the state ( map showing the area and pipeline ) ' it was just like @entity63 shooting at some food ... ' he said of the oil coming from the ground			1
' except we were n't hunting , we were harvesting			0
' gov. @entity76 , who says he was n't even told about what happened until wednesday night , said the state is now investigating its procedures for reporting spills			0
' there are many questions to be answered on how it occurred and how it was detected and if there was anything that could have been done that could have made a difference , ' @entity76 said thursday , when questioned at a news conference on a separate topic			0
' initially , it was felt that the spill was not overly large , ' @entity76 said			0
' when they realized it was a fairly sizable spill , they began to contact more people about it			0
' the farmer likened his find to feeling like @entity63 from the @entity63 ( @entity98 pictured from the 1960s tv show ) @entity10 said he had harvested most of his wheat before the spill , but the land is no longer usable for planting			1
' we expect not to be able to farm that ground for several years , ' he said			0
@entity106 , a subsidiary of the @entity108 , @entity109 - based company that owns and operates parts of @entity16 's oil infrastructure , said in a statement that the affected portion of the pipeline has been shut down			1
' protection and care of the environment are fundamental to our core values , and we deeply regret any impact to the landowner , ' @entity16 ceo @entity115 said in a statement			2
' we will continue to work tirelessly to fully remediate the release area			0
' @entity124 , a @entity2 spokesman for the @entity125 , said the spill is an example of the lack of oversight in a state that has exploded with oil development in recent years			1
' we need more inspectors and more transparency , ' @entity124 said			0
' not only is the public not informed , but agencies do n't appear to be aware of what 's going on and that 's not good			0
' @entity138 , @entity16 's director of contingency planning and emergency response , said the hole in the 20 - year - old pipeline was a quarter - inch in diameter			1
@entity16 officials were investigating what caused the hole in the 6 - inch - diameter steel pipeline that runs underground about 35 miles from @entity19 to a rail facility outside of @entity149 , near the @entity151 border			1
@entity52 said state and federal regulators are monitoring the cleanup , and @entity16 estimated it would cost $ 4 million			2
a natural layer of clay more than 40 feet thick underlies the spill site and has ' held the oil up ' so that it does not spread to underground water sources , @entity52 said			2
' it is completely contained and under control , ' @entity52 said thursday			0
' they got very lucky			0
