by @entity0 for @entity1 after battling for almost an hour with his hands gripped to his rod and adrenaline pumping through his body , a @entity3 tourist has caught the world 's biggest @entity10 carp - weighing the same as a person			1
@entity13 , from @entity14 , @entity15 , finally reeled in the whopping 10st 6lbs fish while on holiday in @entity18 - after he had it on the line for an exhausting 50 minutes			1
the keen angler , who was holidaying at the idyllic three - acre @entity24 fishing resort in @entity25 , used the simple bait of bread to lure the mammoth fish in - followed by a huge amount of patience and muscle work			0
what a whopper ! @entity13 proudly holds his record 150lb siamese carp at a @entity18 fishing resort give us a kiss ! after landing the monster , mr @entity13 released it safely back into the water at 150lbs , the monster weighed in at 16lbs heavier than the previous record , which , strangely , was also caught by someone from @entity15 on holiday in @entity18			1
@entity45 , of @entity46 , got the perfect 56th birthday present when he caught a 134lb carp at @entity50 's fishing resort in @entity51			2
mr @entity13 told @entity52 : ' it was eventually netted via a rectangular arapaima cage as it was too big for a landing net			0
' it beat my previous @entity10 carp best of 84lbs and although it is bigger than the current @entity60 [ @entity60 ] record i 'm not going to be putting a claim in as i 'm currently fishing for one believed to be even bigger at another venue that to date has not been landed before			1
' world beater : the 150lb carp is 16lbs heavier than the previous @entity10 carp record @entity66 : mr @entity13 can barely see over the fish 's giant body as he cradles his prize in his arms after posing for a few obligatory photos with his prize , mr @entity13 released the giant carp safely back into the water			1
mr @entity13 is the former winner of prestigious angling award the @entity76 , and is very used to tackling monstrous - in 2012 he landed a 450lb arapaima from @entity78 , also in @entity18			2
a former @entity3 barbel record holder , he now lives in @entity80 , and travels all over @entity18 in search of the world 's biggest catches			2
in 2011 he succeeded in catching @entity18 's holy trinity of fish - a @entity10 carp , a @entity88 catfish and an arapaima - during a three - day excursion			1
take the bait : the bread flake and method feeder used to lure in the whopper , before the 50 - minute battle siamese carp are the largest species of carp , and are only found in the @entity99 , @entity88 and @entity101 river basins			0
they are among the largest freshwater fish in the world , and can weigh up to an enormous 660lbs , though it is believed none that large currently exist			0
they make a tasty meal , which means their numbers have declined rapidly			0
because they are so popular for both food and fishing , they have been deliberately stocked in lakes for centuries , and are farmed all over @entity117			0
the @entity119 world record carp weighed in at 101lb 4oz , and was reeled in in @entity120 in 2012 by @entity123 angler @entity121			0
