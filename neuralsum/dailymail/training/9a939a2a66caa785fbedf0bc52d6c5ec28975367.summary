@entity12 : cabinet office minister @entity7 and transport secretary @entity8 called on @entity9 to veto releasing the report @entity12 critics say the gagging attempt is ‘ absolutely disgraceful ’ and are using freedom of information laws to demand that the @entity22 , from november 2011 , be published			1
the information commissioner has rejected ministers ’ objections and ordered them to release the report			1
but in a leaked letter to mr @entity9 , circulated to ministers , mr @entity7 and mr @entity8 urge that an emergency veto be put in place			1
such a veto is hardly ever used , but was deployed to stop publication of @entity34 discussions of the @entity35			0

the letter to mr @entity9 says : ‘ continuing with the appeal would create political and presentational difficulties at a crucial point in the @entity12 project ’s development			1
[ therefore we should ] exercise the veto now			0
counsel has advised that we are very likely to lose the appeal			0
