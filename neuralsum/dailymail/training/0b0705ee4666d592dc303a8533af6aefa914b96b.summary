by @entity0 published : 07:28 est , 7 march 2014 updated : 05:13 est , 8 march 2014 building of a 574ft building , dubbed @entity5 's @entity4 , will begin within weeks - after a lengthy battle to secure funding for the project			1
the tower will be erected on the beach in front of @entity12 in @entity5 , previously home to the historic @entity14 , instead of standing near water level , visitors to the i360 tower will now need to look 574ft down to see the ocean			1
the pier , which was built in 1866 was declared beyond repair in 2004			1
when construction work is finished in the summer of 2016 , a futuristic tower will take its place			2
@entity5 's answer to the @entity4 will be 574ft ( 175m ) high			1
it will be built on the beach running parallel to the @entity12 in @entity5			2
the building will replace the former @entity14 created in 1866 planning permission was granted in 2006			2
eight years on , following a deal between the @entity32 and @entity31 , @entity29 has agreed to increase its loan for the project from £ 14.8 million to £ 36 million despite the fact that the i360 was granted planning permission in 2006 , a private backer withdrew funding worth £ 15 million last year and construction plans ground to a halt the @entity43 - based architects behind the tower , @entity45 , also designed the @entity46			1
on top of council funding , @entity45 will inject £ 6 million into its construction the tower will have a capacity for 200 visitors at one time			1
the visiting dock will look out onto the city from almost 600ft above ground level the project 's website claims that the i360 will follow the same spirit as the @entity14 by offering visitors to ' walk on air ' in the same way as they were previously invited to ' walk on water ' despite the fact that the i360 was granted planning permission in 2006 , a private backer withdrew funding worth £ 15 million last year and construction plans ground to a halt			1
eight years on , following a deal between the @entity32 and @entity31 , @entity29 has agreed to increase its loan for the project from £ 14.8 million to £ 36 million			1
the @entity43 - based architects behind the tower , @entity45 , also designed the @entity46			1
on top of council funding , @entity75 also inject £ 6 million and a further £ 4 million will be invested by local enterprise group @entity78			0
the total bill for the tower has now soared to £ 46.2 million			2
@entity81 and council leader @entity82 has argued that the loan will be financially beneficial for the city			0
he said that the £ 21 million made in interest payments and fees could be used to repair seafront arches , structures , sea defences and walls			2
the structures are currently in need of repair work worth £ 70 million			1
mr @entity82 said : ' this is a crucial project for revitalising our tourism industry and our seafront for years into the future			0
it will very clearly signal that our city is open for business - both to visitors and investors			0
' this deal will bring in over £ 1m a year additional income to the council whilst also regeneration the local area and supporting our tourism economy			2
' it will provide an extraordinary and spectacular new centrepiece to our seafront			0
as well as providing a great view out , it changes the way the world views us - distinguishing @entity5 from competitors and signalling that the city is really buzzing			0
' but @entity118 group leader @entity117 told the @entity119 that the @entity31 and the @entity120 could be putting tax payers into debt			0
he told the @entity5 paper : ' next week they will be committing two generations of council taxpayers to nearly forty million pounds of debt on a project that no private investor will support			2
' the tower is expected to welcome 750,000 visitors each year			1
at one time , the attraction can hold 200 visitors			0
if work begins on time , the i360 is expected to open in june 2016			0
the @entity14 was previously home to a theatre and a concert hall			2
it attracted two million visitors each year fallen glory : @entity5 's @entity14 was the crown jewel of the city in the 1920s			1
but over 100 years after it was first built , the pier has been left to fall apart and is now derelict			0
a 30 year battle was launched to restore the piece of architecture			0
but in 2004 the campaign ended after @entity148 declared it beyond repair @entity14 was once one of @entity5 's most stunning settings			1
the pier has since fallen into disrepair and been ravaged by two fires			0
its spot will soon be taken by the i360 tower mods and rockers : @entity5 was a fashion capital for mods and rockers in the 1960s			1
mods would wear suits and ride scooters while rockers generally wore leather			0
pictured here is a group of mods on the @entity5 seafront the @entity14 was built in 1866 by naval architect @entity174			1
the pier was home to a theatre and a concert hall			0
it has been closed since 1975			0
since then the pier has been ravaged by two fires and several storms - little of the original pier still stands			0
it is one of only two @entity185 i listed piers in the @entity188 , the other being @entity189			0
in its heydey , the @entity14 attracted two million visitors a year			1
from june 2016 the i360 , which will cost more than £ 46 million will stand in the same spot			1
the project 's website claims that the i360 will follow the same spirit as the @entity14 by offering visitors to ' walk on air ' in the same way as they were previously ' walking on water '			1
the i360 will also welcome visitors with @entity209 tollbooth 's to celebrate the pier 's history and parts of the same cast iron structure will also be used for the tower 's visitor centre			2
although the pier will no longer stand , a proportion of revenue from the i360 will go towards promoting the pier 's heritage .			0

the 574ft tower will be erected in the spot previously held by @entity5 's historical @entity14
the @entity14 was built in 1866 but declared beyond repair in 2004
a £ 36 million loan has been taken out to fund construction of the i360
the tower will attract 750,000 visitors and bring in £ 1 million each year , it has been *predicted*
work will be carried out by family firm @entity45 architects
