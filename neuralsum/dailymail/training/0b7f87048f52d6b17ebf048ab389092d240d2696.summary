by @entity0 pope @entity1 has hit out at @entity3 mobsters and warned them they will ‘ end up in hell ’ if they do n’t change their ways and renounce their ‘ blood - stained money and blood - stained power ’			1
the pontiff made the stark warning following the death this week of two - year - old @entity14 , his mother @entity8 and her partner @entity9 who were killed in a mob hit after assailants opened fire on their car			1
pope @entity1 addressed the mobsters after a prayer vigil at a @entity20 church for relatives of innocent people killed by the mafia , during which the names of 842 victims were read aloud			1
@entity1 , pictured in @entity26 , @entity27 , in january , warned @entity3 mobsters they will go to hell if they do n't change their ways and renounce their ' blood - stained money and blood - stained power ' after voicing his solidarity with the family members , @entity1 said he could n’t leave the service without speaking to those not present : the ‘ protagonists ’ of mafia violence			1
addressing the absentee mafiosi , @entity1 said : ‘ this life that you live now wo n’t give you pleasure			1
it wo n’t give you joy or happiness			0
‘ blood - stained money , blood - stained power , you ca n’t bring it with you to your next life			1
‘ there ’s still time to not end up in hell , which is what awaits you if you continue on this path			0
’ @entity1 has spoken out frequently about the evils of corruption and wrote a short booklet on corruption and sin in 2005 when he was archbishop of @entity56			1
but this was his first major address to @entity3 victims of organised crime , who were gathering near @entity20 for an annual retreat organised by a mafia - fighting priest that takes place annually on march 21			2
the pontiff even mentioned this week ’s tragic hit , which occurred in @entity68 , near @entity69 , in the southern @entity3 region of @entity71 , during his address			2
@entity9 , 43 , left , his partner @entity8 , 30 , centre , and her son @entity75 , right , were killed instantly after hitmen forced their car off the road and then opened fire with machine guns in @entity68 , near @entity69 , in the southern @entity3 region of @entity71 , earlier this week mafia hitmen shot dead convicted mobster @entity9 , 43 , his girlfriend and her two - year - old son after forcing them off the road in high speed chase ‘ you had a father , a mother			1
think of them , ’ he said			0
’ @entity90 , 43 , his partner @entity8 , 30 , and her son @entity75 , were killed instantly after hitmen forced their car off the road and then opened fire with machine guns riddling it with bullets - amazingly @entity75 ’s two older brothers , sitting in the backseat , escaped unharmed			1
all three were killed instantly in the hit which happened late on monday night and apart from the two children - who are now in police protection - there were no witnesses			0
a police spokesman said : ' this was a massacre , simple as that			0
the child stood no chance and was killed instantly along with his mother and @entity90			0
‘ we are investigating all possibilities - although we believe that @entity90 was probably the intended target we have to remember that his partner was also married to a murdered criminal			0
amazingly two other children inside the car survived the incident which happened late on monday night			0
police said other than the two youngsters - who are now in police protection - there were no witnesses ' there could be several motives revenge or drugs both @entity90 and @entity14 had connections to drugs trafficking and they were both involved with organised crime			0
' the only witnesses are the two children who are in a secret location with police and hopefully they will be able to give us some clues			0
' mrs @entity8 ’s first husband and father of the three children , @entity14 , was a known mobster who was murdered three years ago			2
it is not the first time that children have been innocent victims as a result of mob hits - earlier this year another three - year - old boy was murdered after gunmen targeted a car he was travelling in killing two men as well .			2
