@entity0 , who was wrongfully convicted of second - degree murder and freed after 10 years in jail , has revealed how his newfound friend @entity3 is coping with the ' @entity5 court playing games with her life '			1
@entity0 , 29 , got in touch with @entity9 when he was released from prison last year after his conviction was overturned by a @entity13 state appeals court panel and the pair quickly struck up a close bond			1
he has revealed that @entity9 , 26 , is ' doing considerably well ' as she awaits the verdict from her latest trial - now the third she has been subjected to - for the 2007 murder of her roommate @entity22			1
the sweet taste of freedom : @entity0 pictured enjoying a steak and a beer following his release from prison just a couple of hours earlier in november 2013 something in common : it 's no secret that @entity0 and @entity3 have become good friends since both were released			1
here @entity3 holds a sign welcoming @entity0 with her best friend @entity34 speaking to @entity35 , he said : ' she seems to be doing incredibly well considering the circumstances			2
the @entity5 courts continue to play games with her life which is sadly no different than what happens here on a daily basis			0
' having said that , she is very positive and we all believe that justice will prevail and the facts that have proven her innocence will set her free			0
it comes after @entity0 revealed reading @entity9 's book helped get him through some of his darkest days			1
in parallels to @entity0 's case , @entity9 and her former boyfriend @entity53 were also wrongfully imprisoned , serving four years in an @entity5 prison for the 2007 murder of @entity60 student @entity22			1
@entity9 returned to the @entity61 a free woman in 2011 after her 2009 murder conviction was thrown out by an @entity5 appeals court			1
but she is now being tried for a third time in her absence for the murder			0
@entity5 's highest criminal court overturned @entity9 's acquittal in the 2007 murder of a @entity60 student and ordered a new trial			1
@entity0 has said he is able to identify with @entity3 on many levels			2
' i know first hand what it is like to have the world turn against you based on a series of lies , ' he said in a revealing post on @entity83			1
@entity9 , who became a free @entity0 supporter after hearing about his case , says the two have formed a close friendship since his release			1
‘ to get arrested and to get charged for a crime you did n't commit is incredibly easy , and you lose your life very fast , ’ @entity0 said upon his release from jail			1
‘ but to get out of prison , it takes an army			0
’ @entity0 's case gained attention because his high school classmate , @entity99 , claimed to have recalled through dreams that he and @entity101 had killed @entity102 during a late - night robbery after a @entity104 of partying			2
@entity99 has since recanted his testimony but is still in prison			0
@entity0 has since revealed that while he was in prison , he read @entity3 's book , waiting to be @entity110			1
@entity0 has decided to speak publicly about @entity3 's case , saying he has studied her situation in depth			2
waiting to be read : @entity0 says he learned a lot about @entity3 's case by reading her book whilst in prison			1
he also drew comfort and inspiration from her words wrongfully imprisoned : @entity3 , left , and @entity53 , are seen outside the rented house where 21 - year - old @entity60 student @entity22 was found dead in @entity122 , @entity5 ' i knew about @entity3 's case while i was in prison			2
they 're at this crucial point with their lives right now and to not say something , not speak up to not help spread awareness , it would be negligent , ' @entity0 said			0
like his own case of wrongful imprisonment , many people had a knee - jerk reaction to @entity9 's story based on misleading information that has leaked into the media			2
in his posting on @entity83 , @entity0 points out several facts about @entity9 's case for people to understand : 1 ) when @entity3 was initially interviewed by the @entity5 police she was badgered for hours in an interrogation that was later ruled illegal by an @entity5 appeals court			1
@entity3 eventually signed a false confession in a moment of desperation			0
25 % of wrongful convictions are the result of false confessions ( remember , my conviction also hinged on a false confession from @entity155 ) 2 ) there was plenty of dna evidence in the room in which @entity22 was murdered including blood and fingerprint samples			0
none of it matched @entity3			0
but it did match with @entity22 , who was later convicted of the murder			2
3 ) the only ' witnesses ' against @entity3 were later deemed unreliable by an appeals court			0
( sound familiar ? ) @entity0 , left , had been sentenced to 40 years for the 2001 murder of @entity102 , right , a newspaper sports editor freed at last : after his release from jail last november , @entity0 , 29 , held an emotional press conference thanking his parents and the ' army ' of people who had helped in his struggle 4 ) @entity179 had a history of breaking and entering and wielding a knife			1
in the days following @entity22 's murder he fled the country			0
5 ) the prosecution did n't have any real facts to convict @entity3 – so turned the trial into a character assassination , presenting @entity9 as a crazed , sexual deviant			2
( in the same way my prosecution presented me at trial as a spoiled rich kid ) ' @entity0 notes that despite @entity9 being originally convicted of @entity197 ’s murder and then freed by an @entity5 appeals court , the current retrial that is taking place is as a result of an appeal launched by the prosecution			1
he believes the retrial is ' a politically motivated move [ by the prosecution ] to cover their mistakes			0
' if @entity9 loses this appeal she may be extradited to @entity5 to serve a life sentence for @entity197 's murder			0
if she is n't extradited she will essentially become a prisoner in her own country , never able to leave the @entity61 the conviction with hang over her for the rest of her life			0
on his decision to speak out about @entity3 's predicament , he says the choice was a simple one for him to make			0
' people helped save my life and i feel like if i can do some small part in helping another person get their life back then i 'm going to do that			0

@entity0 , 29 , *walked* free from a @entity13 prison last november after *spending* almost ten years in jail for a crime he maintains he did n't commit
@entity0 had been convicted of the 2001 murder of @entity228 sports editor @entity102 when he was just 17
@entity0 says he could identify with fellow former @entity61 prisoner @entity3 , whose book waiting to be @entity110 , he read while in jail
says he knows what it 's like to have ' the world turn against you based on a series of lies '
since leaving jail he has been in touch with @entity9 who was a *prominent* @entity0 supporter
@entity0 revealed @entity9 is coping well as she awaits the verdict of her third trial for the 2007 murder of her roommate @entity22
