by @entity0 the 100 - year - old mystery surrounding how four - legged animals developed the ability to breathe air has finally been solved			2
scientists claim the ability was passed down by ancient @entity7 - a group of fish widely regarded by scientists as the ancestors from which the first land animals evolved			1
they believe @entity7 originally developed their breathing abilities using tiny holes in the top of their heads called ‘ spiracles ’			1

the same ability can be seen in @entity20 , the most primitive bony fish alive today ( left ) the same ability can be seen in @entity20 , the most primitive bony fish alive today			1
in @entity20 , a small valve opens a lid over these spiracles to allow air to be sucked in and pumped out each time the fish surfaces			2
these same holes in @entity7 were also transformed through evolution to become @entity30 tubes , which allow humans to hear			1
‘ until now we ’ve only had theories about the origins of breathing in the evolution of fish to land animals , ’ said @entity33 palaeontologist professor @entity32			1
air - breathing fish , such as @entity42 , revealed how four - legged animals developed the ability to breathe research into @entity20 dates back to @entity47 ’s defeat by the @entity48 at @entity49 in 1801			1
one of his appointed naturalists , @entity52 , had a specimen of a strange fish with fleshy limbs caught from the @entity56			0
writing in the conversation , professor @entity32 notes that this was the @entity60 , meaning ' many fins '			0
also called the reedfish or birchir , it is widely regarded as the most primitive living member of the true bony fish			0
this group includes some 30,000 living species , including many of the fishes like snapper and salmon			0
further expeditions set out in the late 1890s to find more specimens of this strange fish			0
scientists thought that understanding its life history would reveal how fishes might have evolved into land animals			2
‘ some early 19th century scientists had these wacky ideas that fish just jumped onto the land and started gasping for breath and developing limbs , ’ he said			0
‘ but our research shows that the transformation actually started happening within the fish themselves while they were still in water			0
’ breathing through the spiracle gives the fish an evolutionary advantage as they can surface to breathe while keeping their eyes under water for predators			1
as part of the study , a team based at the @entity101 observed species of @entity20 for 360 hours and measured the amount of oxygen it was taking in			0
professor @entity32 said the findings on @entity20 is the ‘ smoking gun ’ that points to fossils such as @entity7 as being capable of breathing in air through their spiracles			1
‘ other lobed - finned fish fossils of that age show large spiracles on top of their heads and the earliest known tetrapod fossils also have large open spiracles on their heads			0
‘ all this points to the ability of these fishes to take in air from their spiracles as the first type of breathing , which ultimately helped them leave the water and invade the land			0
’ professor @entity32 said once the four - legged descendants of the lobed - finned fish abandoned the water , the ability to breathe through their spiracles declined as they switched to breathing using their mouths and nostrils , as humans do today			1
‘ the spiracles eventually became the hearing canal in which tetrapods transmitted sound to the brain via tiny inner ear bones , and this has remained throughout the evolution of fish right through to humans , ’ he said			2
‘ if not for the bold evolutionary experiments of these prehistoric fish breathing in air through the top of their heads , we might not have evolved such a keen sense of hearing			0
’ professor @entity32 said the findings on @entity20 is the ' smoking gun ' that points to fossils such as @entity7 ( pictured ) as being capable of breathing in air through their spiracles			1

@entity7 , fish ancestors of land animals , breathed through ' spiracle ' holes
these same holes are seen in @entity20 , the most primitive fish alive today
the spiracle gives the fish an evolutionary advantage as they can surface to breathe while keeping their eyes under water for predators
spiracles in @entity7 were also transformed through evolution to become @entity30 tubes , which allow humans to hear
