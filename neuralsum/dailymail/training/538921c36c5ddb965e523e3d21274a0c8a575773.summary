the @entity2 gives hundreds of rules for women to follow , both explicit and implied , in the @entity16 and the @entity17			1
going to extremes : @entity9 spent 12 months following the @entity2 's instructions for women , from making her own clothes to ' submitting ' to her husband for example , women should dress modestly , submit to their husbands - passages of the @entity2 insist that husbands are the masters of their wives - and remove themselves from their communities while menstruating			1
@entity28 15 to 18 has a passage detailing rules for women to live by - with particularly stringent rules coming into play while the woman is menstruating , stemming from the theory that women on their periods are untouchable			1
during the days she was menstruating over the course of the year , the @entity39 - based writer , 31 , a @entity40 who describes herself as ' liberated ' , stayed home from church , carried around a seat cushion to avoid sitting on chairs outside her home , abstained from sex and touching her husband , grew her hair out and slept in a tent			0
before embarking on the 12 - month experiment mrs @entity9 wrote on her blog : ' starting this month , i will commit one year of my life to following all of the @entity2 ’s instructions for women as literally as possible			1
going back to basics : during the days she was menstruating over the course of the year mrs @entity9 removed herself from the community and slept in a tent learning new skills : mrs @entity9 took up sewing as she started making her own clothes ' from the @entity16 to the @entity63 , from @entity64 to @entity65 , from the @entity67 code to the letters of @entity69 , there ’s no picking and choosing ... well , except for polygamy and a few other things that i ’ll tell you about later			1
' among other things her new lifestyle involved rising before dawn each day ( @entity78 31:15 ) , growing out her hair ( 1 @entity80 11:15 ) , calling her husband @entity5 ' ( 1 @entity81 3:5 - 6 ) , and camping out in the backyard for the duration of her monthly period ( @entity85 15:19 - 33 )			0
she also started making her own clothes , ( @entity78 31:22 ) and learned how to cook ( @entity86 2:3 - 5 )			0
talking about her experience , she told @entity88 : ' some of these experiences were funny , others were rewarding , and others were terrible			0
' in one @entity93 video , mrs @entity9 offers advice to other women who are considering camping when they are menstruating			1
sat in her tent , she tells viewers : ' you ’re going to need a flash light , some blankets and a sleeping bag , some reading material and a walkie talkie to call for help if you get attacked by a cat			0
' take it from me practicing biblical womanhood is n’t as simple as it sounds			0
' mrs @entity9 ' project - turned - book examines all the @entity2 's instructions for women as precisely as possible , taking on powerful theological questions , gender issues , and the possible future of the @entity117			1
playing by the rules : mrs @entity9 dressed modestly as she attempted to obey the @entity2 's commandments using her book 's platform , she says she aims to challenge evangelical leaders and advocate an increase of women within church leadership			1
mrs @entity9 also writes a namesake blog that draws thousands of evangelical readers , which she launched in 2008 to promote her first book , a memoir that tiptoed around faith and fundamentalism			2
her yet - to - be - released book has already gained a following , with nearly 100,000 readers visiting her blog monthly			0
her publisher said they expected 40per cent of her book ’s total sales would come from @entity40 bookstores			0
however , despite the book 's popularity , she has revealed that one of the biggest @entity40 bookstore chains in the country , @entity147 , has chosen not to carry the book because of its use of the word ' vagina '			2
she told @entity153 : ' i do n’t know if they were more offended by my vagina or my brain			0
the only thing i know is that my editor said , " if you leave this word in , there ’s a good chance @entity147 wo n’t carry it			0
" when mrs @entity9 mentioned on her blog that her editor suggested she remove the word vagina from the book ’s manuscript to appease the @entity40 bookstore , her readers were outraged			2
homebody : in deference to @entity86 2:3 - 5 and 1 @entity171 , mrs @entity9 tried to stay ' busy in the home , ' honing her cooking skills , she is seen here with homemade matzah toffee for @entity176 praise him like i should : proverbs 31:23 states that a virtuous woman 's husband is ' respected at the city gate , ' so mrs @entity9 made a poster that said ' @entity184 ' and stood in front of the ' welcome to @entity187 ' sign a petition on @entity189 called put the word ‘ vagina ’ back into @entity9 's book ! was started , and one fan made @entity195 t - shirts			1
she added : ' writers adjust our content to fit this very sanitized , very strict conservative mold , which means we ’re not producing the best writing or the best books we can produce			0
' everyone bends over backward to meet these demands			0
' but with such a large show of public support , mrs @entity9 decided to leave the word vagina in her book and face the consequences			2
