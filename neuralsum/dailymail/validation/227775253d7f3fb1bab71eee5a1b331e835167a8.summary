a man rushed to hospital for a kidney transplant has spoken of the dilemma he faced after learning the donor organ could be infected with @entity5			1
@entity6 had waited four years for a donor organ before he finally got the call to say a kidney and pancreas had become available			1
the transplant window was so small that after putting the phone down at 3am , he was rushed from his home in @entity14 to @entity15 for the operation			0
but upon arriving , he was told that the organs had come from the victim of a drugs overdose - and it would be two weeks before tests revealed if they were @entity5 free			1
@entity6 , 40 , had waited four years for a donor organ before he finally got the call to say a kidney had become available			1
but he faced a dilemma after learning the donor organ could be infected with @entity5 mr @entity6 , 40 , was born with type 1 diabetes , and his kidneys began to fail by the time he was 32			1
he said : ' they showed me into a room and told me the donor organs had come from a death by drug overdose and asked if i still wanted to go ahead			1
' because the person died by drug overdose , they would n't know whether the donor had @entity5 for two weeks			1
' it was a scary process having to say yes or no after sitting in the back of an ambulance for hours			0
' i thought : " do i risk it and say yes , or do i say no and wait another 18 months , or even longer ? " ' in the end , i went ahead with it			0
' the kidney transplant surgery took 10 hours and left mr @entity6 with 32 staples in his stomach			1
after the surgery , he was sick for days , unable to even stand up straight , and was concerned about the risk of @entity5			0
two weeks later the @entity5 results came back - and were , to his relief , negative			2
he has since made a full recovery			0
mr @entity6 said : ' my diabetes has completely changed - it 's amazing - and even that does n't describe how good i feel			1
' it 's a second chance and i will be forever grateful to the donor 's parents for making that decision			0
' two weeks after the kidney transplant , the @entity5 results came back - and were negative he has now set up a support group for transplant patients - the @entity64 - which supports patients going through the transplant procedure			1
he explained : ' doctors have the clinical experience and can tell you what 's going to happen during surgery , but they do n't have a realistic explanation of what is going to happen for the patient			0
' it 's good to have someone to talk to who has been through what they 're about to go through			0
' the transplant has made me feel like i really want to give something back			0
' last year , two patients in @entity84 died after being given kidney transplants infected with a parasitic worm			2
@entity87 , 42 , and @entity88 , 67 , were each given a kidney from a transplant donor who was carrying the deadly worm in his organs when he died			2
doctors were not aware the donor had the worm - known as @entity96 , which lives in soil and is found in horses - when the transplant operations were carried out at the @entity101 in @entity102			2
mr @entity88 and mr @entity87 began to ' deteriorate rapidly ' after their surgery and died less than three weeks later			2
the two men are part of only five cases ever recorded across the world - and all have died from the worm infection			0
mr @entity88 , of @entity102 , and mr @entity87 , of @entity110 , had kidney transplants in november 2013 but both died before @entity113			2
a post-mortem examination revealed they both died from infection called @entity117 which was caused by the parasitic worm .			0

@entity6 , 40 , had waited 4 years for a donor kidney and pancreas
eventually got a call to say there was one available and rushed to hospital
there , doctors *informed* him the donor had died from a drug overdose
*hiv* test results would take 2 weeks , while transplant had to be immediate
mr @entity6 decided to take the gamble and accept the infected organs
has since been told the donor did not have @entity5
