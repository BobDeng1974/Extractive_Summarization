little fighter : six month old baby @entity11 , from @entity23 , @entity24 , is one of just 63 people in the world with a heart that squirts blood instead of pumping it after being born with the extremely rare condition ' 8p23 deletion ' brave : @entity11 , pictured with his mother @entity33 and father @entity34 , is now due to have an operation to secure an elastic band around a heart valve to stop it squirting blood rather than pumping it the condition is caused by cells in the body having a small but variable amount of genetic material missing from one of their 46 chromosomes - chromosome eight			1
