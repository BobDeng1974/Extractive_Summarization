by @entity0 , @entity1 the problems continued to mount for @entity5 @entity4 captain @entity3 in the early stages of the @entity7 on thursday , even though @entity8 was fit enough to take part			1
just days after withdrawing from the final round of the @entity11 with a back injury , @entity8 declared himself pain free after nine holes of practice on wednesday and teed off at 8:35am local time alongside @entity16 and @entity17			1
but fellow @entity5 @entity18 and @entity19 were not so fortunate , with the world number six pulling out after suffering back spasms and defending @entity5 @entity7 champion @entity19 aborting his title defence after 10 holes because of a lingering neck injury			1
@entity18 , who has already sealed his place on the @entity4 team for @entity33 , was replaced in the draw by first reserve @entity35 , who teed off at 9:05am alongside major champions @entity37 and @entity39			1
@entity19 has been severely hampered by two bulging disks in his neck since april and was eight over par for the day , having triple - bogeyed the par - five 10th , when he decided to pull out of the year 's final major			2
he shook hands with his playing partners , fellow @entity5 @entity45 and @entity46 , who are both former @entity7 winners , before leaving the course			1
' i 've been feeling pretty bad all week , ' @entity19 told reporters			2
' i felt bad last week			0
i have n't made a birdie in 45 holes and i 'm just not able to play golf right now			0
' i do n't need to be out here			0
i tried to do what i could to be able to compete some and give it a go , but it is just pointless			0
' @entity61 duo @entity60 and @entity62 , both currently outside the automatic @entity4 qualifying places , were part of a six - strong group sharing the early lead on two under par , with @entity17 one under , @entity16 level and @entity8 one over par. @entity16 's opening drive on the par - five 10th was so far left of the fairway that he feared it had gone out of bounds and hit a provisional ball , but the left - hander found it up against a fence and was able to eventually scramble a par. @entity76 plays and @entity77 and @entity78 to challenge @entity79 again in action : meanwhile @entity8 was fit enough to tee off on thursday @entity81 : the @entity5 superstar had been an injury doubt after suffering from a back problem last week woods narrowly missed from 20 feet there for birdie but failed to get up and down from just off the green on the 11th and had to save par from 20 yards short of the 12th after badly mis - hitting his approach			1
@entity16 had also dropped a shot on the 11th despite a typical recovery shot from way below the level of the green , but the five - time major winner and @entity17 both birdied the 12th			0
woods slammed his club into the ground after hitting his tee shot into the crowd on the par - three 14th , but bounced back from a bogey there by chipping in on the 16th for his first birdie of the day			2
at one over par he was four off the lead shared by five players including @entity60 , who had followed a bogey on the 15th with birdies on the 17th and 18th to reach the turn in 33			0
@entity62 remained two under after eight holes with former @entity4 captain @entity115 just a shot further back after following eight straight pars with a birdie on the 18th			2
mixed start : former champion @entity16 was also in action on day one at @entity121 digging one out : @entity16 hits one out of the trees on the tenth hole during his opening round			0

@entity18 pulls out of @entity7 with back spasms
@entity19 aborted title defence after 10 holes because of a lingering neck injury
their withdrawals are a blow for the @entity5 @entity4 team
meanwhile @entity8 was fit enough to tee off on thursday *morning*
