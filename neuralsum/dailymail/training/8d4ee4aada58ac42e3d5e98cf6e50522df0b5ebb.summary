@entity0 will be calling on the kids this weekend after injury and suspension decimated @entity5 's squad			1
the club 's best - ever top - flight start has been brought to an abrupt halt in recent weeks , with tuesday 's @entity10 loss at @entity11 continuing an embarrassing run of form			2
that was @entity5 's fifth straight defeat in all competitions and a result which has had repercussions far beyond denting confidence			2
@entity0 looks on after his side lost 1 - 0 to @entity21 team @entity11 in the @entity10 @entity22 ( left ) is one of ten players who could be missing for @entity5 's game against @entity25 @entity26 and @entity27 will miss @entity25 's visit to @entity29 's this weekend after being booked at @entity30 , while @entity31 is suspended after being sent off against the @entity21 side			1
those absentees compound a growing injury list , with @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 joined on the sidelines by @entity22 and @entity39			0
as if that was not enough , @entity40 and @entity41 are doubts for a match in which @entity0 will be relying on @entity5 's much - vaunted youth system			1
' our approach is not different now because we lost the last five games , ' the @entity5 manager said			0
defender @entity31 ( centre ) was sent off in @entity5 's defeat in @entity52 on tuesday ' we know that if we have a lot of injuries , like we have , it is one of the philosophies of the club to bring in young players			1
' maybe we will play two or three young under - 21 players this saturday , maybe we will have three on the bench			2
this is one of the philosophies			0
' @entity64 and @entity65 are among those academy graduates with a chance of making a first @entity68 start this weekend			0
@entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 are others vying for a place in the squad to face @entity25 , as @entity5 look to end their worst losing run of the 21st century			1
@entity78 striker @entity41 ( left ) is another potential absentee for @entity0 on saturday against @entity25 ' it 's sometimes difficult , ' @entity0 said			1
' the team was doing well after a good start to the season and after a few weeks disappointed about the results			0
' not the way we lost against @entity89 or @entity90 but very disappointed about the way we lost against @entity52 , because that was the first time to be disappointed about the team to have the fight , the spirit , the aggressive play that we did n't show			0
' @entity52 showed us how you have to deal and to beat a @entity68 club when you are a @entity21 team			2
that message , we need it for this saturday			0

@entity5 play @entity25 at @entity29 's on saturday in the @entity68
@entity0 could be without as many as 10 first - team players
