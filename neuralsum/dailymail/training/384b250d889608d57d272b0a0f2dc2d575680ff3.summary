prince @entity1 's bodyguards were accused yesterday of turning a blind eye during his visits to a paedophile friend 's ' house of sin '			1
protection officers accompanied the royal to @entity10 's @entity9 mansion where he allegedly partied with naked young women			1
@entity12 , who was @entity10 's butler for 11 years , said : ' @entity1 was with security			1
he had his two bodyguards from @entity15			0
i can remember their names			0
' the bodyguards were off duty and they slept in one of the guest bedrooms			2
' hundreds of under - age girls are said to have been abused at @entity10 's mansion and one woman says she was forced by the shamed financier to have sex with @entity1 when she was 17 , which is below the age of consent in @entity9			1
but there were calls yesterday for @entity15 to investigate whether @entity1 's protection officers suspected or witnessed any criminal activity at @entity10 's homes			1
a royalty protection source said : ' @entity10 's @entity9 mansion appears to have resembled a five - star brothel			1
and @entity10 behaved like a pimp			2
' i would have expected protection officers to have advised the duke to leave immediately			2
' if they did not , the big question is why ? the problem is that protection officers are very well paid – some get up to £ 80,000 a year which is double their basic pay – because of overtime and special allowances			2
' they can sometimes forget they are working for the police , not the royal household			0
challenging a royal about their conduct , or the people they are mixing with , can result in a loss of trust and their removal from a very lucrative job			0
' @entity69 , a former head of the protection unit , said the prince 's bodyguards might be able to corroborate his account that he never had sexual relations with his accuser in 2001			1
but he added : ' i would have expected prince @entity1 to have been severely warned on the dangers of liaising with @entity10			1
this is an extraordinary case			0
i would have expected officers in royalty protection to bring matters to senior officers ' attention far earlier			0
' @entity84 , @entity85 deputy chairman of the @entity87 police and crime committee , said : ' if royal protection security staff ever suspect that criminal activity is taking place at a venue they are present at , they have an obligation to take action			0
turning a blind eye should never be an option			1
' @entity36 , now 30 , claims she was forced to have sex with prince @entity1 when she was 17 , which is below the age of consent in @entity9 @entity102 , the @entity103 deputy chairman of the same committee , said : ' the met commissioner should look into this as a matter of urgency			1
' these are under - age sex allegations and i do have a problem with officers – that we , as taxpayers , fund – going to events like these alleged parties			1
' the commissioner needs to start asking questions about what these officers saw and what prince @entity1 did or did n't get up to			1
' a spokesman for the @entity123 on the @entity87 said @entity15 had ' serious questions to answer '			0
he added : ' those being protected at public expense have a responsibility to consider the situations they are placing those public servants in and a duty to ensure their actions do not bring their protection officers into disrepute			2
if what you 've been told is true there are serious questions to be asked as it would appear to be an inappropriate position to put these protection officers in			2
' but @entity142 , who headed the royalty protection squad at the time of the @entity10 parties , has defended the ' laissez faire ' approach , saying it was ' not an offence for a man or woman to be naked in a private house '			2
he also suggested he would ' not expect a protection officer to question ages ' of young girls because of the difficulties involved			0
' every day of the week , clubs or bars are being fooled and duped , ' added the retired chief superintendent			0
' protection officers are there purely to ensure their [ the royals ' ] safety			2
their role does not include questions of morality			0
the only compromise to this is , of course , if there is a question of legality			0
then i would expect the protection officer to take advice from a senior officer or supervisor			0
' the royal ( left ) with @entity177 , then 17 , ( centre ) and @entity179 ( right ) in early 2001 mr @entity142 said no officer approached him with concerns about @entity1 's conduct when he led the protection squad from 1998 to 2005			1
' if a protection officer comes to a supervisor [ about a royal 's behaviour ] we would advise them and not turn a blind eye , ' he added			1
' but if you never hear of anything you do n't know if a blind eye has been turned [ by the protection officer ]			2
' @entity1 was pictured with @entity10 in february 2011 after the billionaire was released from jail after serving time for paedophile offences			2
the ensuing scandal forced the prince to cut his ties with the @entity201			0
but the controversy was reignited last week by the release of @entity201 court papers on the @entity10 case			0
in the files , miss @entity36 claims @entity10 forced her to have sex with @entity1 three times in 2001 – in @entity209 , @entity210 and on the billionaire 's @entity212 island			1
she and other alleged victims want to overturn a deal that @entity10 struck with federal prosecutors that saw him jailed for 18 months in 2008 for under - age sex offences			1
@entity220 has repeatedly insisted that for @entity1 ' any suggestion of impropriety with under - age minors is categorically untrue '			1
mr @entity12 confirmed that @entity224 , who is a mother of three , was a visitor to @entity10 's @entity226 mansion			1
his comments come from unpublished extracts of an interview with the @entity230 in 2011			0
hundreds of under - age girls are said to have been abused at @entity10 's mansion , including ms @entity36 ( pictured ) security sources suggest that @entity1 's gallivanting around the world with @entity10 , 61 , cost taxpayers well over half a million pounds of public money			1
the duke allegedly spent several weeks at @entity10 's @entity9 mansion and also visited his sumptuous property in @entity210 and shared holidays with him in @entity242 , @entity243 and the @entity212			1
sources confirmed the total bill in the decade up to 2011 is conservatively estimated to be £ 500,000			0
the figure is made up of business class air fares , hotel bills , salaries and overtime			0
@entity10 has branded all his accusers liars and gold diggers			0
@entity15 declined to comment when asked whether royalty protection officers had raised concerns about prince @entity1 's conduct with @entity10 or about his visits to the paedophile 's @entity226 mansion			1
it said : ' we do not discuss matters of security and protection			0
' mr @entity142 insisted it was not true that the generous pay protection officers receive would make them reluctant to jeopardise their position by challenging the behaviour of a royal or reporting it to a senior officer			2
' that 's high risk			0
when the truth comes out – and it always comes out - their days are numbered , ' he said			0
additional reporting : @entity276 and @entity277 a royalty protection source said : ' @entity10 's @entity9 mansion ( pictured ) appears to have resembled a five - star brothel			1
