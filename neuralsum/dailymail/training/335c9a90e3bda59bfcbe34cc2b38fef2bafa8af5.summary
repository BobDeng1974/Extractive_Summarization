by @entity0 with its blazer - wearing spectators , @entity2 's and strawberries , @entity1 has long been a byword for smart @entity7 summer style			1
despite attempts by players to get round the all - white dress code , the @entity9 officials have been quick to clamp down on them - even coloured trim is out if it measures more than 1cm			1
but for those watching the action this year , it seems , different rules apply			0
debenture ticket holders , who pay £ 50,000 for a five - year ticket , no longer have to adhere to a ' smart but casual ' dress code			1
instead , pretty much anything goes - even trainers , as long as they 're not too dirty			2
how they were : last year , spectators at @entity1 's @entity25 wore smart blazers , shirts and ties how they are now : this year , spectators may wear anything apart from ripped jeans or dirty trainers the traditional smart dress code has been relaxed for 2014 , and now only ' torn jeans , running vests , dirty trainers and sports shorts ' are deemed unacceptable			1
even shorts are allowed , as long as they are ' tailored '			0
as a result , spectators have been spotted tieless , in head - to - toe denim , on @entity25 's most exclusive , not to mention expensive , seats			0
one debenture ticket holder , who asked not to be named , said the relaxing of the rules had ruffled a few feathers in @entity46			1
' we pay a lot of money for our tickets , and getting dressed up to watch the tennis is part of the whole thing , ' he said			2
' it 's a shame to turn up and see people in jeans and t - shirts sitting along from you			2
it does n't feel right at all , especially as they 've just tightened the rules on what the players wear			1
' debenture tickets are released for sale every five years , offering a @entity25 seat for every day of the tournament for a five - year period			1
dressing down : holders of £ 50,000 debentures tickets have a new , relaxed dress code for 2014 easy does it : comedian @entity75 saw no reason to dress up for his afternoon watching @entity77 the next batch of debentures will cover the period 2016 - 2021 and went on sale last month for £ 50,000 each			1
debenture ticket holders can transfer their tickets during the five - year period to anyone wanting them enough ; according to the @entity87 website , the most recent debenture sale price was £ 105,500			1
the loosening of the rules over debenture seats dress code comes at the same time as the introduction of tighter guidelines governing what players wear on court			1
no longer can women wear bright coloured pants , as @entity100 did last year			1
the new rules came after concerns were voiced at sponsors sneaking more colour into their players ' outfits to promote their brands			0
@entity1 is one of the very few major sporting tournaments not to have major advertising around the courts			0
officials there appeared to be hardening , rather than relaxing , their attitude to spectators ' dress			0
just two years ago , organisers issued a dress code for members of the @entity9 , following concerns that sartorial standards were slipping amongst members			2
how times change : @entity124 got away with orange knickers last year , left , but it 's all white now , right photographs of acceptably - dressed members were included in the handbook for the first time , illustrating how to avoid the disgrace of being banned from the clubhouse			0
it stated : ' the dress standard for gentlemen is lounge suit or tailored jacket , shirt , tie , trousers and dress shoes			0
' ladies are expected to dress to a similar standard			0
' the other photographs illustrated ' unacceptable dress ' , and offending items included ' t - shirts , distressed jeans and trainers , bare midriffs , jeans and flip flops '			1
strapless tops and shorts were banned , as were ' zipper jackets , casual or scuffed shoes , hoodies , pumps and short skirts '			0
not so traditional : these spectators took inspiration from tennis balls for their unusual @entity1 style members were warned : ' @entity166 's dress standards in the @entity167 will be strictly enforced			2
' to avoid any embarrassment please ensure your attire and that of your guests is appropriate			0
' founded in 1877 , @entity1 has always been part of the @entity7 summer season when , traditionally , the landed gentry would come up to @entity175 for a summer of entertainment			2
other events include @entity178 , @entity179 , and the @entity180			0
no - one at the @entity9 was available for comment on the new debenture dress code today			1
new rules were introduced this year in a bid to clamp down on sponsors sneaking in bright , branded sportswear			2
now every article of clothing - including knickers - have to be white , and that means white , not cream or even off - white			0
the new rules state that coloured trim around the edge of clothing is out if it is more than a centimetre wide , and they apply even to caps , wristbands , socks , and bandanas			0
@entity202 's @entity201 , left , and @entity204 's @entity203 , right , made sure they wore all white this year some players were outraged at the stricter dress code , saying that white knickers under a short white skirt would go see - through when players sweated			1
former tennis star @entity212 said some female players had to go bra-less after their coloured bras showed through their white t - shirt when they perspired , while he said men had the same problem with navy underpants .			0

debenture tickets cover the most expensive @entity1 seats for five years
the next batch , for 2016 - 2021 , have already been sold - at £ 50,000 a ticket
traditionally , debenture ticket holders wore a smart jacket and tie , or dress
this year the dress code has been relaxed and only ' dirty trainers ' are out
no tie needed , t - shirts ok , and jeans are fine as long as they 're not ripped
one ticket holder said : ' getting dressed up for the tennis is part of the fun '
*decision* comes as rules governing what players wear are tightened up
colours - even coloured pants - are out in bid to stop overt sponsors ' logos
