it was the worst nuclear disaster in history , and so dangerous was the fallout that the @entity22 government evacuated 350,000 residents , creating an @entity24 where time has stood still ever since			2
scores of abandoned gas masks cover the floor of what may have been a shop in @entity14 , a once - thriving town of 50,000 people near the @entity22 border with @entity33 @entity34 has stood still at this fairground ride that once echoed to children 's laughter : now rusted and blackened , it serves as a bleak memorial to long - gone families hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated from the exclusion zone , leaving behind homes into which they had invested time , money and love most people are barred from living in the zone , named the @entity50 , which covers an area of more than 1,000sq miles around the abandoned plant , to protect them from the effects of any lingering radiation			1
a few residents refused to leave , and a handful of older residents have moved back to be close to family graves , but the area is mostly uninhabited and has now reverted to forests			0
tourists may obtain day passes , and workers who are rebuilding the damaged sarcophagus are allowed in for limited hours only each month			0
scientists the area will not be safe to live in for another 20,000 years			0
earlier this month , photographer @entity64 was allowed in , and spent four days photographing the irradiated ruins of the towns where hundreds of thousands of families once lived , worked and died			2
these astonishing photographs document what she saw on her journey from @entity13 to @entity14			0
the public swimming baths would once have resonated to shrieks from excited children - the now - drained pool has not been swum in for decades the @entity75 on april 26 , 1986 , was the worst nuclear accident in history , killing 64 and leaving many thousands more with long - term effects including cancer and deformities brightly painted tanks , their guns crossed , stand unused in the @entity83 , 27 years after a test at the nuclear reactor went so disastrously wrong large public buildings are now simply falling apart : ceiling tiles have dropped off and smashed , wall claddings have slid down the schoolchildren who were evacuated in the aftermath of the explosion at the @entity13 nuclear reactor are now adults this photograph shows how vast strip lights dangle precariously , still attached by wires to the ceilings they were nailed to more than quarter of a century ago while people have been forced out of the exclusion zone , nature - including deer - has regained control , with much of it reverting to forest what looks like a school common room or hospital waiting room is a shell of its former self - chairs still in rows are covered with dust and fallen plasterwork the fabric of both public and private buildings is slowly rotting as the vast , 1000sq mile zone of alienation is gradually reclaimed by nature trees sprout between paving slabs as nature gradually regains the upper hand over the exclusion zone - experts estimate it will not be habitable for another 20,000 years the explosion and subsequent fire at the @entity125 released large quantities of radioactive particles into the atmosphere the disaster began at @entity13 reactor number four , when a power surge occurred during a systems test , causing a series of steam explosions and a fire which sent a plume of radioactive material into the air a gas mask would have provided little protection to the people of @entity13 and @entity14 , many of whom suffered cancers and deformities as a result of the radiation released in the accident very few people enter the @entity13 exclusion zone - a handful of people refused to leave , and some elderly people moved back to be near graves , but the zone is largely desolate			1

photographer @entity64 was allowed into the @entity50 surrounding the @entity13 nuclear plant
her pictures show the desolate area covering 1,000 *square* miles that was evacuated after blast in april 1986
schools , shops , fairgrounds , swimming pools and homes - all are slowly falling into ruins as zone returns to forest
