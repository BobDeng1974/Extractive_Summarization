@entity0 in southern @entity1 sits right at the centre of @entity3			1
but the tiny , mountainous republic has a claim to fame unknown until now - @entity7 can trace their origins to the remote region			2
dna research revealed that genetic markers linking people living in the @entity3 republic of @entity0 , southern @entity1 , with indigenous populations in @entity15			1
a study of the mutations indicated a lineage shift between 13,000 and 14,000 years ago - when people are thought to have walked across the ice from @entity3 to @entity15			1
@entity0 in @entity1 : a study of genetic markers in @entity10 showed that the lineage of @entity7 changed around 13 - 14,000 years ago - when people are thought to have walked across the @entity25 this roughly coincides with the period when humans from @entity1 are thought to have crossed what is now the @entity25 and entered @entity15			1
' @entity0 is a key area because it 's a place where people have been coming and going for thousands and thousands of years , ' said dr @entity33 , from the @entity34 in the @entity35			1
among the people who may have emerged from the @entity37 are the predecessors of the first @entity7			0
roughly 20 - 25,000 years ago , these prehistoric humans carried their @entity41 genetic lineages up into the far reaches of @entity1 and eventually across the then - exposed @entity25 land mass into the @entity44			2
' our goal in working in this area was to better define what those founding lineages or sister lineages are to @entity52 populations , ' @entity33 said			0
the region lies at the intersection of what is now @entity3 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58			2
an engraving of early native americans from the 1500s : @entity10 research hints that their ancestors came from one tiny region in central @entity3 dr @entity33 's team checked @entity10 samples for markers in mitochondrial dna which is always passed on by mothers , and y chromosome dna which sons inherit from their fathers			1
because of the large number of gene markers examined , the findings have a high degree of precision			0
' at this level of resolution we can see the connections more clearly , ' @entity33 said			0
looking at the y chromosome dna , the researchers found a unique mutation shared by @entity7 and southern @entity88 in the lineage known as @entity90 mitochondrial dna is found in tiny rod - like ' powerplants ' in cells that generate energy			2
both kinds of @entity10 showed links between @entity88 and native americans			0
in the y chromosome dna , the researchers found a unique mutation shared by @entity7 and people from southern @entity0			1
the findings are published today in the @entity103			0
calculating how long the mutations they noted took to arise , @entity33 's team estimated that the southern @entity88 lineage diverged genetically from the @entity52 lineage 13,000 to 14,000 years ago , a timing scenario that aligns with the idea of people moving into the @entity44 from @entity1 between 15,000 and 20,000 years ago			1
though it 's possible , even likely , that more than one wave of people crossed the land bridge , @entity33 said that other researchers have not yet been able to identify another similar geographic focal point from which @entity7 can trace their heritage			0
' it may change with more data from other groups , but , so far , even with intensive work in @entity56 , they 're not seeing the same things that we are , ' he said			0
in addition to elucidating the @entity128 connection , the study confirms that the modern cultural divide between southern and northern @entity88 has ancient genetic roots			0

tiny region in central @entity3 has dna link to @entity7 today
ancestors thought to have walked across ice 13,000 years ago
@entity0 is ' key place ' , because central *location* means ancient peoples passed through
