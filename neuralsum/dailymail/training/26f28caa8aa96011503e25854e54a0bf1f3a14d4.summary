' i was ringing them on a daily basis in tears because last week i could n't even open my front door			1
the man from the housing association told me to wiggle the handle			1
' they told me repeatedly everything was all right ... they 've not been interested in me at all			0
' ms @entity9 said she then involved @entity16 mp @entity99 - and only after that her landlords sent round insurance assessors , 10 days ago , who spent two and a half hours examining her house			1
two days ago they told her they would be coming round to dig an exploratory trench - but the sinkhole opened up before they had the chance			0
ms @entity9 said : ' the mp rang me this afternoon from @entity111 , bless him			1

my porch ! @entity9 , 35 , had her sinking porch demolished six weeks ago authorities are looking into it : the sinkhole is the latest in a string of landslips caused by extreme weather lucky chance : @entity124 , pictured , moved out of the house over the sinkhole last night after his tenancy ended			1
it 's thought three people were still living there but did not even wake up when it appeared the house over the sinkhole is believed to have been occupied by three people , including lodgers			1
one lodger , @entity124 , had moved out by coincidence only last night after his tenancy ended			0
@entity138 on the estate - built just six years ago - said they have been told two houses will have to be demolished			1
@entity142 councillor @entity141 inspected the hole this morning and said : ' if the house is not pulled down , it will fall down			1
there is nothing underneath it			0
the entire corner of the house is unsupported			2
the road is basically a bridge and the house has nothing supporting it			2
' the rumour is that there were lime kilns here in the past , before my time			0
there were holes underground and they have got bigger with all the heavy rain			1
' this is n't the first sink hole in the area			0
they have been trying to fill one in down the road for years ' - taxi driver @entity167 , 58 ' the rain is the hair that broke the camel 's back , and that the hole has got bigger and bigger with the heavy rain			1
taxi driver @entity167 , 58 , whose flat overlooks the hole , said : ' the police knocked on my door at 7.45 this morning to say the houses were being evacuated			1
it was quite a shock , but this is n't the first sink hole in the area			0
they have been trying to fill one in down the road for years			0
one of the residents evacuated was a heavily - pregnant woman			2
her partner was briefly allowed back into their semi-detached home to collected items needed for the birth			0
a @entity17 police spokesman said : ' the hole , which is in a residential @entity194 , has mainly affected the road			1
' however , 17 properties have been evacuated for the safety of residents in the area			2
' the hole is approximately 35ft wide and 20ft deep			0
' police are working with partner agencies , including @entity203 , specialist structural engineers and utilities companies to assess the situation			1
' the road , and surrounding roads , have been closed for the safety of residents and whilst agencies work at the scene			0
' the house could be seen being held up by triangular struts as dozens of police officers and utility workers gathered around it			2
police officers secured the scene while gas and electric engineers acted to cut off local supply			2
the alarm was raised around 7am when a builder who was driving down the road stopped and noticed the huge crater at the side of the house			2
he knocked on neighbours ' doors before calling the police			2
evacuated : the crater opened up in a quiet suburb of @entity16 , @entity17 destroyed : the hole was littered with what looked like pipework and fencing			1
police are investigating investigation : police have been at the scene since the sinkhole suddenly opened up at 7.30am today police : a spokesman said the force was working with ' @entity203 , specialist structural engineers and utilities companies to assess the situation ' hole : at first glance the sinkhole appears like an ordinary flower bed - but it is some 20ft deep , said police urban sinkholes are more common after heavy rain , because they are caused by water flowing through channels below ground and eroding away soil or soft rock like limestone			1
as the earth is carried into other parts of the ground large caverns can open up , usually unknown to the authorities or the people living above them once the cavern can not support the weight of the topsoil above it , it collapses into the ground			2
one of the world 's largest sinkholes , the @entity274 in @entity275 , is more than 2,000ft deep			2
an @entity280 spokesman said : ' @entity280 was called by the police at 8.20am and a team arrived on site shortly after			0

' the road has been closed and we are awaiting further instructions from the structural engineers in attendance on when we can return to site			0
' it comes after a 15ft - deep hole appeared on the central reservation of the @entity297 near @entity298 , @entity299 , on tuesday			0
initially thought by the authorities to be a sinkhole , it was revealed to be a chalk well called a @entity306 hole , a structure made up of several underground caves accessed by a vertical shaft			0
@entity17 , the site of today 's hole , has a history of chalk mining dating back to @entity312			1
@entity313 was used since the @entity315 period as a building material			0
@entity16 was largely built in a chalk stone valley where the @entity318 meets the @entity319			1
the modern housing estate was built in 2008			0
it was believed the homes were constructed on former industrial estate land , or what is known as a brownfield site			0
there are more than 100 historic mines known throughout the county but when the mining stopped , the entrances to their vertical shafts were not recorded properly and can cause nasty surprises for homeowners later on			2
about 100 years ago ' chalk - drawers ' worked throughout the @entity336 , mining chalk from shafts up to 30ft deep which have since caused countless small collapses in fields , according to the @entity340			1
good as new : @entity341 , 19 , with her new car after her local council filled in a 30ft hole with concrete dude , where 's my car ? @entity341 's @entity349 vanished into this hole on her parents ' drive huge : this 15ft - deep hole on the central reservation of the @entity297 in @entity299 was discovered to be a chalk well earlier this month , a sinkhole measuring 30ft deep swallowed up a car after opening up on the driveway of @entity359 and @entity361 's home in @entity362			2
nobody was inside the @entity349 - owned by their devastated daughter @entity341 , 19 - when the ground gave way underneath it			0
the family said there was no indication that the sinkhole would appear on february 2			0
mrs @entity361 , a 51 - year - old school bursar , said at the time : ' the actual size of it is what i think has taken us most by surprise - it 's just swallowed the car whole			0
' @entity341 expressed her delight after motoring website @entity381 bought her a new car this week after the council plugged the hole with concrete			0
she had gone into hysterics after discovering her prized car had disappeared into the 30ft crater and was barely visible beneath mounds of earth			0
but bosses at digital retailer @entity381 read news reports of the incident and invited @entity341 to choose a replacement vehicle , meeting the Â £ 2,200 cost as a publicity stunt			0
in december last year , torrential rain caused a 130 - ft deep sinkhole to form in the @entity400 , after part of the old @entity402 near @entity403 , @entity404 , caved in .			2
