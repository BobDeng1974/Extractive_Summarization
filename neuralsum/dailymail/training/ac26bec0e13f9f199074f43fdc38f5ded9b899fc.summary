with @entity2 in talks over a £ 40million @entity5 takeover , @entity1 ’s side continue to show signs of progress on the pitch following a third win in five games under their new manager			1
@entity1 ’s third victory in five games since he replaced @entity14 gives him an identical record to new @entity17 boss @entity16 , even though it was not enough to lift @entity2 out of the @entity20 relegation zone			1
‘ it ’s the best we ’ve played since i came here against a very good side , ’ said @entity1			0
‘ that performance will give the boys a huge lift			0
we ca n’t keep going win lose , win lose , we ’ve set the standard now			2
’ @entity31 wheels away after scoring his first of the night as @entity2 saw off @entity17 @entity31 sticks his boot in to @entity33 as @entity2 sealed a precious win to boost their hopes of rising up the table @entity2 : @entity37 7 ; @entity38 6 , @entity39 6.5 , @entity40 5.5 , @entity41 7 ; @entity42 6 ( @entity43 52 , 6 ) , @entity44 7 ; @entity31 8 ( @entity45 71 , 6.5 ) , @entity46 7.5 , @entity47 7 ; @entity48 7 ( @entity49 84 )			1

a richly deserved @entity2 win was built on @entity31 ’s first goals for the club			1
the first came in the ninth minute when @entity47 made a run from inside his own half and fed @entity83 wide on the right			2
the @entity86 ’ s low cross into the box picked out @entity31 who swept the ball across goalkeeper @entity56 and into the far corner			1
captain @entity91 had a header cleared off the line by @entity60 before @entity31 grabbed a second goal nine minutes before half - time			1
@entity47 was involved again in a slick move on the left before clipping a cross to the back post where @entity31 squeezed another first - time effort past @entity56 from a difficult angle			1
he could have completed a hat - trick in the second half after great work by the impressive @entity105 but blasted well over			2
@entity31 was replaced by @entity45 shortly afterwards and it was the substitute who set up a rather fortuitous third goal for @entity39 in the 76th minute			1
@entity91 scores his team 's third goal with a crisp shot from inside the penalty area skipper @entity39 celebrates after putting the gloss on a convincing victory for @entity2 @entity45 ’s low cross from the left picked out his captain 15 yards from goal and his mis - hit shot left @entity56 wrong - footed as it bobbled past the keeper and into the far corner			1
without their top scorer @entity123 , who has been given compassionate leave to return home to @entity126 , @entity17 ’s best chances fell to @entity67 but he failed to convert and then @entity37 produced an outstanding late save to deny substitute @entity66			0
it left @entity17 still waiting for their first away win of the season and @entity16 was furious over the way his team succumbed in the first half			2
‘ i ’m bitterly disappointed , ’ he said			0
‘ it was the most disappointing 45 minutes since i ’ve been here and i was raging			0
@entity1 ( right ) shouts instructions to his team as @entity17 counterpart @entity16 looks on ‘ we were aware that they are strong starters but we lost too many battles in the first half			2
some of our decisions were poor and we allowed the ball to come into our box far too easily and got punished for that			0
‘ in the second period we tried to get back in the game and perhaps if we had got the next goal it would have been a different outcome			0
but overall @entity2 deserved their win tonight			1
’ it could not be better timed for wanderers amid the interest from @entity5			0
@entity17 , under their colourful @entity153 owner @entity152 , know all about the ups and downs that could bring .			0

@entity31 struck twice in the first - half to put the @entity159 in the driving seat
@entity39 added a second to put the gloss on victory
the win puts @entity2 in touch with a *cluster* of teams at the foot of the table
