@entity0 and @entity1 will do battle for the biggest prize in world football at the @entity5 , but one man has already achieved victory at the @entity8			1
@entity10 , 43 , the man man who invented the magic vanishing spray adopted for use in @entity13 , us set to reap the financial rewards after years in poverty and facing bankruptcy			1
the foam has proved a huge success in stopping defenders from encroaching on the 10 - yard gap on free - kicks , and disappears in 60 seconds			2
@entity23 officials are considering introducing the foam , which has been used in @entity13 and @entity1 's domestic leagues , into @entity27 's top - flight			1
thin white line vanishing spray to mark out free - kicks has been used at the @entity8 @entity10 told the @entity31 that seeing the spray being used for the first time at the @entity8 was a ' magical moment ' and added : ' i dedicated 14 years of my life to this idea			1
' after the referee brought it out the first time i started receiving text messages from my family and friends			2
' it was the first time i got emotional , my eyes welled up			0
i remember thinking , " i ’m not crazy			0
it was all worth it "			0
' @entity10 grew up as one of five children living in a crowded three - bedroom house in @entity50 , a small town between @entity51 and @entity52			1
in the air : the @entity23 is expected to discuss with clubs whether to use it in action : the spray stops defensive walls from encroaching too far forward ' we all slept together in one small room			1
i never had any toys and we had few clothes			0
my parents sent me out to work at the age of eight			0
but now , @entity10 acknowledges he is set to make a lot of money if his product is adopted globally			1
' i hope that whatever financial gain is comparable to my 14 years of struggle			0
i ’ve paid a high price			0
i chose not to see my children grow up so that i could make this work			2
' he continued : ' @entity75 , though , i hope to have contributed to football – that we now have a tool that will help referees to keep order , help free kick takers score more goals , and improve the experience of football for everyone			0
