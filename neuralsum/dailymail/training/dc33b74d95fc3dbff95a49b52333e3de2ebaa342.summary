does anyone motor for pleasure any more ? they do on the @entity3 , which snakes 1,553 miles down @entity5 's @entity4 from @entity6 to @entity7			1
two friends and i flew into @entity11 planning to lay siege to some of @entity4 @entity5 's famous golf courses , including @entity15 and @entity16 , as well as sample the @entity3 ( or @entity18 )			1
a world wonder : the @entity20 of @entity21 , in @entity22 , are an example of @entity5 's west coast at its finest but after settling in at our sinfully comfortable base - @entity26 at @entity16 , @entity22 , with its sea views , four - poster beds and well - stocked , self - service ' honesty ' bar - we decided life was too short to whack dimpled white balls around the countryside with sticks			1
@entity35 was to hire a ' classic car ' in which to cruise the @entity3			1
here , the first obstacle emerged			0
the only one available was a 1970 @entity39 hardtop , with a very small back seat			0
this would have involved one of us being packed and unpacked into it by @entity45			0
so we also rented a back - up @entity47 diesel at @entity11			2
two of us would ride in the @entity39 at a time			0
the third would drive shotgun , admiring our progress from the rear			0
on the road : the @entity3 runs along @entity5 's west coast for 1,553 spectacular miles the @entity39 offered , as you 'd expect of a modestly priced , @entity57 motor : heavy , unassisted steering ; vague , squeaking brakes ; a high - minded lack of radio			1
all features that might have an @entity39 enthusiast salivating , i concede			0
our diesel @entity47 was licence - threateningly swift , packed with bells and whistles and adored by all			2
@entity71 said he was trading in his @entity72 for one when we got back			0
from @entity16 we proceeded , in convoy , to @entity74 and the awesome @entity75 , and thence to @entity76 , with its @entity5 music bars			1
we planned to stop for lunch at 300 - year - old @entity80 's @entity79 at @entity81 , but could n't find it on the map			1
so we stopped at a bar in @entity85 , @entity22 , for directions			0
the sole customer , awoken from his mid-morning reverie , informed us confidently : ' i know it exists all right			0
' we had to go right at the church , up the road past the big hay shed and we 'd see a sign for @entity80 's			1
which , eventually , we did and enjoyed a marvellous , fishy lunch			0
a perfect pitstop : the road meanders through a host of small towns and seafront communities along with two pints of @entity102 and a glass of @entity104			1
not each , i should add			0
swapping drivers from time to time , our curious convoy motored through the @entity108 , a weirdly beautiful sea of ' fertile rock ' , so called because of its mixture of nutrient - rich herb and floral species			2
one of @entity114 's officers remarked of it in 1651 : ' it is a country where there is not water enough to drown a man , wood enough to hang one , nor earth enough to bury them			2
' yet their cattle are very fat			0
the grass grows in tufts of earth of two or three foot square which lies between the limestone rocks and is very sweet and nourishing			0
' we called on @entity130 , a cheery farmer on the @entity131 whose sons make delicious , dark @entity134 chocolate , flavouring their product with berries and hazelnuts from the rocky hills above their property			0
a grand old dame of the highway : @entity142 conducted his road trip in a classic @entity144 they now supply the @entity147 billionaire @entity146 at his new hotel and golfing complex at @entity150 , on the @entity152 coastline of @entity22			1
i do n't suppose we covered more than 100 of the @entity3 's 1,553 miles in our enjoyable , two - day visit			1
but i will be back there to drive some more - and to hike parts of the magical @entity18 - or , ride a bike alongside the wild @entity152			2
the scenery 's great , as is the food and the entertainment , but @entity5 's people are its chief attraction			1
their quirky sense of humour is refreshing , too			0
since we were all ' spoken for ' ( more or less ) , we were careful to drive straight through @entity165 , @entity22			0
their ' match - making festival ' was on			2
loose men and women - loose in the innocent sense of being ' free to marry ' - socialised amiably on the main street			2
how they laughed when we told fellow guests at the @entity174 - nursing their malts in the ' honesty ' bar - of driving pell mell through the loose ladies of @entity165 in our squeaking @entity39 , the @entity47 as rescue vehicle in case of breakdown			2
a great place to pull over : @entity142 's itinerary took him through @entity76 , which is renowned for its music bars @entity5 's great poet , @entity187 - whose home at @entity189 , @entity190 , we passed - said of one of his characters : ' he had an abiding sense of tragedy , which sustained him through temporary periods of joy			1
' that 's the @entity5 for you			1
a five - day @entity199 of @entity5 with @entity200 ( 0844 873 6110 , www.seeirelanddifferently.co.uk ) costs from £ 695 per person , including four nights ' b&b in various hotels , plus five days ' hire of a 1974 @entity39 roadster or 1990 @entity207 ( deduct £ 25 per person for a @entity209 , or add £ 50 pp for a 1975 @entity211 )			1
