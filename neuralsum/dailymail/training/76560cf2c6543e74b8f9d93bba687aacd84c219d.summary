one witness said : ‘ if this is not death by neglect i do n’t know what is			0
kiddies should not be left in a pool like this - there are so many risk factors			1
’ witness @entity26 , who has been lifeguarding and doing first aid for the past 36 years , told how she tried to rescue the little girl			2
she said : ' i was in the changing rooms and a lady came in and said " there 's an incident in the pool , is there a life guard ? " ' the child was on the bottom of the pool , so i dived in and got her out			1
i was n't really aware of what had happened when i got there , my concern was with the little girl and rescuing her and resuscitating her as best i could			2
' she was on the bottom , she was unresponsive and i pulled her out as per my training and then i resuscitated her on the side			2
' i did manage to resuscitate her and she was breathing when the ambulance arrived			0
obviously i 'm devastated for the poor little girl , it 's very sad			1
' at the time you are quite shocked because all your training is coming into action something you think you will never ever do but i 'm satisfied i helped out in this case			0
' she added that no lifeguards had been on duty in the pool , because it is not the policy in a private pool			2
she said : ' basically children in swimming pools should be looked after by their own parents			0
' it 's not necessary to have lifeguards necessarily because life guards are there to prevent accidents and parents have got to be aware that children ca n't swim , they are not strong swimmers and they need to wear floatation aids especially little children and older children need to be monitored as well			2
