scientists from the @entity11 are predicting an ‘ explosion ’ of flea activity in @entity5 homes over the next few weeks , as the temperature and humidity rates are set to reach the ideal climate for fleas to awaken and breed			1
@entity20 winters in recent years have seen the flea population swell , which means that infestations are seen on a larger scale than before			2
homes with pets that either have fleas , or have not been treated as a precaution , are the most at risk			0
‘ pet owners should be warned that these overwintered parasites may spring out of their dormant state during the warmer temperatures in july , ’ said @entity29 of the @entity11			1
‘ @entity20 winter temperatures have seen flea populations rise over recent years , meaning that the risk of infestation will only increase in the warmer months			1
‘ they can thrive in our soft furnishings and carpets as larvae and eggs and have the potential to remain dormant as pupae for a long time			1
it just takes a few fleas left unchecked to turn into a full blown flea infestation , ’ he warned			2
famed primarily for their itchy bites , fleas can transmit diseases , some of which can affect humans			1
pets and owners can suffer severe allergic reactions to flea saliva , resulting in dermatitis , too			0
infestations of the parasite may become an annual event due to wetter summers and milder winters			1

fleas mature into adults in just 18 days , which means that under the right conditions , one flea can turn into 125,000 of the parasites within eight weeks			1
a single flea will lay approximately 500 eggs in her lifetime			0
in nine months , a female fleas can hypothetically create up to a trillion descendants			0
adult fleas can survive up to 62 days without a blood meal			0
they drink up to 15 times their body weight in a single day - which is why pets with lots of fleas can be anaemic			2
around 95 per cent of the flea population exists in immature stages in sofas and carpets etc. they can carry and spread sickness and diseases to pets and people including typhus and bubonic plague			1

the creatures can jump 13 inches ( 34cm ) which is 160 times their own length			0
this is possible because of the unique structure of a flea ’s rear legs , which catapult it to the height required to reach a passing host at speeds reaching 4mph , ( 6km/h ) and subjecting them flea to forces in excess of @entity161 ’s			0

the project revealed that a single female flea will lay up to 50 eggs per day and around 500 during her lifespan			0
this means that within two months , she could hypothetically generate more offspring than the number of humans on this planet - around 7.152 billion			0
this is because fleas take just 18 days to reach adulthood and start breeding			0
now that 's long jump : fleas can jump 13 inches ( 34cm ) which is 160 times their own length			0
this is possible because of the unique structure of a flea 's rear legs , which catapult it to height required to reach a passing host at speeds reaching 4.3 miles per hour , ( 6.9km/h ) and subjecting the flea to forces in excess of @entity161 's so while the pests can breed very fast , and can bite a pet up to 400 times a day to drink up to 15 times their own body weight , most 95 per cent of the population exists in immature stages near to pets , such as carpets and furnishings			1

‘ resilient fleas inside pupae can remain in this dormant state in the home for a number of months under the right conditions - even surviving vacuuming - with our heated homes allowing the perfect environment for year - round flea activity			1
’ armed and potentially dangerous : famed primarily for their itchy bites , fleas ( pictured ) can cause more than significant damage , including the transmission of diseases , some of which can affect humans			2
pets and owners can suffer severe allergic reactions to flea saliva resulting in dermatitis @entity241 , a parasitologist from the @entity242 ( @entity242 ) @entity5 and @entity243 told @entity244 : ‘ even in the winter months , our cosy homes are the ideal breeding ground for the parasite , which means that their numbers will only increase in the warmer months - the key season for fleas			1
‘ they can thrive in our soft furnishings and carpets as larvae and eggs and have the potential to remain dormant as pupae for a long time			1
