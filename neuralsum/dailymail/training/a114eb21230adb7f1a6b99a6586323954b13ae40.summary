conservative mp @entity0 said the licence fee was ‘ unsustainable ’ the @entity6 licence fee is ‘ worse than the poll tax ’ and needs to be overhauled , the chair of the influential @entity4 committee has said			1
conservative mp @entity0 said the licence fee was ‘ unsustainable ’ and needed to be brought up to date with how people now watched tv			1
he suggested that the licence fee could be added on to people ’s council tax to make it cheaper for the poor			1
earlier this year , culture secretary @entity14 suggested the licence fee could be cut if the @entity15 win the election			1
he said £ 145.50 a year is a ‘ large amount ’ of money and ‘ needs to be looked at ’			1
mr @entity14 also raised the prospect of a fundamental reform of the flat - rate licence fee to reflect the amount of tv watched on the internet			1
mr @entity0 ’s call for a fundamental change to the way the corporation is funded increases pressure on the government to reform the licence fee			2
he said : ‘ i think in the long term it 's unsustainable			0
‘ i think most people , almost everybody , accepts that the licence fee as it currently stands need some tweaking to sort out anomalies			2
‘ people 's viewing habits have changed and it needs to reflect that			0
that 's a very simple change and i think people see that			0
‘ you then have the question of whether or not it should remain a flat poll tax , collected through some fairly draconian measures , and whether it should still be criminally enforceable			0
' mr @entity0 added : ‘ government has already announced consultation on decriminalisation			0
i 've been looking at other countries and i think there 's quite an attractive option of linking it to a specific household tax - maybe council tax			2
‘ i think in the longer term we are potentially looking at reducing at least a proportion of the licence fee that is compulsory and offering choice			2
’ @entity6 director general @entity63 , pictured outside @entity64 in @entity65 , is facing a fight to protect the licence fee from being cut culture secretary @entity14 suggested the licence fee could be cut if the @entity15 win the election he added : ‘ it 's a question of introducing choice			1
i 'm not saying i would n't pay the licence fee - i would go on paying the licence fee			2
‘ [ but ] it is a poll tax			0
it 's actually worse than a poll tax because under the poll tax , if you were on a very low income you would get a considerable subsidy			0
‘ the @entity6 licence fee , there is no means - tested element whatsoever ; it does n't matter how poor you are , you pay £ 145.50 and go to prison if you do n't pay it			1
’ he added the era when ‘ everybody either watched or listened to the @entity6 ’ was becoming ‘ less true ’ , in the face of the catch - up services , online streaming , and more choice			0
mr @entity0 said there was not a ' serious possibility of the licence fee going in the next charter renewal ' adding : ' when i say it ’s unsustainable i am talking about over 20 - 50 years			0
