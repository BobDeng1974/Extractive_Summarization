up until that point , @entity9 had searched high and low for the 125 - pound dog			2
he 'd enlisted his motorcycle riding friends to comb the neighborhood and all but shook down every @entity3 shepherd owner he stumbled across , all for naught			0
' it 's the closest thing to a miracle in my life , ' he told @entity33			0
dozer had been stolen from @entity9 's backyard , but not from his heart			0
