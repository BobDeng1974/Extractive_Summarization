one of @entity2 football ’s best - known referees has been censured by the @entity3 for making a racist comment at an officials ’ summit			1
@entity7 , former house - master at @entity8 and the highest - profile official at the start of the @entity11 , racially abused @entity12 , who is black and a referee coaching manager for the @entity3 in non-league football , at a referees ’ meeting at @entity17 on june 21			1
’ @entity7 , 59 , is chairman of the @entity3 ’s referee committee			2
he also sits on @entity40 ’s referees committee and acts as a technical adviser to @entity43			0
he was made an mbe for services to football in the queen ’s birthday honours last month			0
@entity48 , the @entity3 ’s company secretary and group legal director , carried out the investigation when reports of @entity7 ’s inappropriate behaviour first reached @entity54			2
he has been formally reminded of the importance of the code , his duties as a council member and required to undertake equality and diversity training			0
@entity7 has apologised unreservedly , but it is difficult to see how this slap on the wrist will end an incident @entity54 ‘ consider closed ’			2
his positions at the @entity3 , @entity40 and @entity43 look untenable , especially given the @entity3 ’s commitment to diversity at all levels of football			0
the @entity3 will also be embarrassed that such an own goal from one of their senior figures follows their strong stance against @entity11 chief executive @entity76 ’s sexist email exchange			0
@entity7 , who retired as housemaster of @entity78 in 2009 , did not respond to calls on thursday night			0
the @entity80 , which has a long history of equal rights including prize - money , is forging a surprisingly close relationship with the @entity85 , whose membership could never be described as diverse			0
the mutual admiration society has even seen @entity90 ’s junior digital staff invited to @entity85 , while the bespoke clothes hangers in the @entity90 locker rooms are based on the @entity94 design			2
institutions : the @entity80 is forging a close relationship with the @entity85 @entity99 broadcaster @entity98 ’s comment at last year ’s @entity90 that champion @entity101 was ‘ never going to be a looker ’ created such a storm that the then culture secretary @entity103 wrote to the @entity99 director general demanding action			1
however the @entity105 have welcomed @entity106 back into the fold to the extent that both his daughters , @entity110 and @entity111 , have been employed in the broadcast office during the tournament			0
@entity114 will drop to no 10 in the rankings at the end of @entity90 and any further slide is likely to have a significant impact on his earnings as most of the deals involving the leading players have financial penalties for being out of the top 10			1
@entity114 signed a £ 4.6million deal with @entity125 on the eve of the tournament and while their top brass were at @entity90 to watch @entity114 begin his title defence , they missed wednesday ’s horror show against @entity132			1
slipping : @entity114 's earnings will suffer significantly after his disappointing @entity90 performance @entity136 presenters and pundits plugging their sponsorships has become a sensitive issue this summer , with @entity140 ( @entity141 ) and @entity142 ( @entity143 ) having to curtail their involvement			1
yet @entity80 committee man @entity145 has been allowed to blatantly promote his backers @entity147 on the @entity99 with only a mild censure			2
@entity145 , wearing tennis kit for a breakfast television interview , was asked what he was doing and seized the opportunity to mention the bank			0
a @entity99 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity99 makes every effort to not give undue prominence to any event sponsors			0
on this occasion @entity145 made a mistake and has been reminded of the @entity99 ’s editorial guidelines			1
’ the @entity99 added that @entity140 and @entity142 had , unlike @entity145 , been using their @entity99 role for commercial purposes			2
promoting : @entity145 plugged sponsors @entity147 during an interview for the @entity99 @entity166 ’s entourage at @entity90 contains a remarkable five nannies			1
but all are said to be needed , with @entity166 ’s wife @entity169 having given birth last may to twin boys @entity176 and @entity177 , brothers for twin girls @entity172 and @entity173 , who were born five years ago			1
entourage : @entity166 has five nannies at @entity90 to help him and his wife @entity169 ( front row , second left ) it will hardly help the integrity of the @entity185 that @entity186 , the head of their anti-corruption and security unit , is the subject of an inquiry after being reported for allegedly making inappropriate sexual advances during an @entity185 dinner in @entity194			1
it is understood @entity186 was the worse for wear when the alleged incident took place in the members ’ dining room at the @entity201 .			0

@entity7 *overheard* making offensive comments during a referees ' meeting
@entity114 will drop to no 10 in the rankings at the end of @entity90
@entity145 has been reminded of the @entity99 ’s editorial guidelines after plugging a sponsor
@entity166 ’s entourage at @entity90 contains a remarkable five nannies
