an abandoned village in @entity1 , the unfulfilled vision of an ' eccentric ' aerospace engineering executive , is up for auction the week of @entity5			0
the old twine mill town of @entity7 , in @entity8 , has n't allowed visitors in decades			1
it may again , as the 62 acres of land and assorted abandoned @entity12 buildings are for sale , with bidding starting at $ 800,000			2
the buildings have n't been used since @entity22 died in 1998 and have closed to curious guests @entity24 of brokerage firm @entity25 says he planned the auction to fall around @entity5 to play up the more mysterious aspects of the town , as ghost stories abound and the property has an ethereal feel			2
@entity7 began in the 19th century as a mill town built around an active twine mill operation on the @entity35			1
in 1972 , @entity22 , who @entity24 describes as a ' very eccentric ' owner of aerospace part corporation @entity37 , bought the property after a lightning strike destroyed the mill. chapel : @entity22 worked to find buildings , like this old chapel , to fill a 19th century tourist destination that sadly never boomed decay : after @entity22 's death in 1998 , most of the buildings fell into disrepair , though the property changed hands and was set for development at several times @entity22 decided to create a victorian - era tourist attraction and traveled around the northeast buying up entire buildings and shipping them to @entity7			1
a post office , schoolhouse , chapel , general store and the original homestead of the mill owners give @entity7 the air of a vibrant yet abandoned town			2
@entity22 even purchased a paddleboat from the @entity66 in the 1960s and brought it to @entity7 , where he hoped to use it to ferry passengers around the lake in the middle of the property			1
but although @entity22 allowed visitors onto the grounds , and weddings were occasionally held at the @entity78 chalet - styled restaurant the town never truly became a bustling hub for tourists and @entity22 died in 1998			1
even the paddleboat began sinking into the lake			0
@entity83 : large home tracts are laid out throughout the village , which never became the destination @entity22 was quite hoping it would flashback : the show @entity90 shot an episode about @entity7 , which was a quiet tourist destination starting in the 1970s , but was later abandoned origins : @entity7 was originally the home of a twine mill , and pictured here in this photo posted to the town 's @entity97 is the original @entity100 mill , which was struct by lightning in 1972 and burned no trespassing signs hang now warning off curious travelers , and @entity104 calls the grounds ' a weird dead spot ' in an otherwise populated town			1
the auction takes place october 28 and @entity24 says visitors have viewed the auction page more than 700 times			0
as for bidding , @entity24 says he does n't know how high the final price will be , but that the 62 acres stand to sell for a high price			0
' $ 800,000 just gets you in the game , ' he added			0
tranquility : in spite of never becoming a vacationer 's paradise , some report going fishing at the pond and even having their wedding on the @entity7 before it was closed vintage : the old @entity127 gives the village a timeless feel that may or may not be preserved by the new owners			0
