@entity0 is confident he will be back to his fighting weight and in a fit state to face the @entity3 next week , despite a meningitis scare which led to a very anxious week in hospital			1
the @entity7 captain was blazing a trail towards november ’s @entity10 series at @entity11 as one of the form back - rowers in the country when he was abruptly struck down by a mystery virus earlier this month			1
what began as a cue for mocking jokes about man - flu and mad cow disease ended with a trip in an ambulance , medical confusion and extreme weight loss			1
@entity0 of @entity26 is tackled by @entity27 of @entity3 at @entity28 in june @entity0 has teamed up with @entity26 at their @entity30 camp after being bed - bound through illness @entity0 was on his way home from a trip to @entity35 on october 16 when he began to feel unwell			1
the condition rapidly deteriorated and , by october 20 , he was being tested in hospital amid fears he had contracted meningitis , which can be life threatening			1
that was eventually ruled out , but the savage virus he was struck down with proved hard to shake off			1
having checked in for @entity26 duty last sunday , @entity0 relived the alarming episode yesterday , saying : ‘ i ’ve never been that ill in my life			1
it was weird , it just came upon me			1
‘ the @entity7 doctor visited me at home and said , “ there ’s something wrong with you ”			1
i said , “ we all know that , but there ’s something more wrong than normal ! ”			2
‘ they sent me to hospital			2
i went to @entity59 and they assessed me there , then they put me in @entity63 on @entity64			2
a week later , i came out on friday			2
they thought i had meningitis and that was the big concern			2
that ’s why they put me in an ambulance			2
they were saying , “ you ca n’t mess around with that ”			2
‘ they knew it was n’t bacterial meningitis but they thought it might be the viral version because i had all the symptoms			2
so they got me straight on to the anti-virals and antibiotics			0
‘ the thing was , i got better a little bit so they stopped some of the stuff , then next day i hit rock bottom again			0
they were n’t sure what was going on so they did a lumbar puncture and took fluid out of my spine , and numerous blood tests			0
’ @entity0 is an energetic character who did not enjoy being consigned to a hospital bed for the best part of a week			1
his usual routine of regular meals and punishing gym sessions were put on hold and it was an uncomfortable scenario for him			0
@entity0 sits out of training on tuesday as he continues to recover from his health scare @entity26 head coach @entity102 instructs as his players are put through their paces at @entity30 ‘ i ’m not used to being inactive for that long , ’ he said			1
‘ the big thing for me was not eating			0
i lost a lot of weight — about five kilos in a week			0
‘ i normally eat five or six times a day but i was struggling to get one or two meals in			0
the hospital food was good , but the lady was telling me off if i had n’t eaten			0
‘ i could n’t open my eyes because they were too sensitive to light			0
my lower back and neck were very stiff so i could n’t really move out of bed			0
i spent hours lying in bed with a cold flannel on my head , in a dark room , on a drip , not eating or drinking — man down , really			0
my temperature was up to 38 degrees			0
’ by his own reckoning , tuesday was the first day that @entity0 felt more or less back to normal			1
the illness appeared to check his powerful charge towards an @entity26 starting place next month , but he remains convinced that he is well placed to feature against @entity3			1
‘ i knew this ( @entity26 ) was coming up , i had been playing well and i wanted to keep that momentum going , ’ he said			1
‘ the good thing was that i did n’t try to force my way back too soon			0
you ’re only as good as your last game so i ’m pretty positive because we got a good win against @entity139 — it was a few weeks ago now ! ‘ i trained with the forwards today , i did some stuff yesterday and i ’m building back up every day			0
‘ i would be extremely disappointed if my illness had a factor in whether i am involved or not			0
‘ we have had two days of the camp			1
i have missed one session outside			0
i think that as of thursday i will be back into the full mix of it , so i do n’t think that is going to be an issue			0
’ @entity26 trained in @entity151 where the team 's brand new gym complex and @entity155 pitch are located @entity156 passes the ball during the @entity26 training session			1
