by @entity0 published : 05:29 est , 27 september 2013 updated : 05:31 est , 27 september 2013 the barbaric practice of flattening girls ' chests to disguise their sexual development has spread from @entity7 to the @entity8 , women 's campaigners warned today			1
girls as young as 10 are having their breasts pounded with hot irons , often by their mothers , to hide the signs of puberty and so protect them against rape and unwanted pregnancy			2
a traditional practice in @entity19 , experts are now warning that it has spread to @entity8 where it is being practised behind closed doors in families of @entity19 extraction			1
the practice of breast - ironing pubescent @entity19 girls is said to have spread to @entity8 - their mothers want to delay sexual advances on their daughters so they can get an education ( file picture ) today women 's charity @entity30 's and @entity33 ( @entity34 ) is holding a conference in @entity36 on the painful , unpleasant and often dangerous custom			1
the charity 's @entity38 said breast - ironing , as it is known , is often used when a girl 's breast develop early , and is done in private , between the girl and her mother			1
' of course it 's happening in the @entity8 , but like everywhere else , no - one wants to talk about it , ' she said			1
ms @entity38 told @entity49 : ' i am an @entity7 woman living in a @entity19 community in @entity36 and it is happening in my community but no - one talks about it			1
' mothers are doing it to their daughters and telling them it is for their own good , because they believe that			0
' their daughters are not reporting it so no - one talks about it			0
' she said the practice , which is not illegal in @entity19 , was happening ' behind closed doors ' in the @entity8 and needed to be stopped before it became widespread			1
@entity19 women : the custom of breast - ironing is said to be practised by mothers on their daughters she said : ' it is harmful , but we are told it is a cultural practice			1
this is what they said about female genital mutilation ( @entity78 ) at first , but now it is admitted that that is wrong			0
we need the same to happen for breast - ironing ' ms @entity38 said she was contacted by a police officer who arrested a woman for breast - ironing her daughter			1
she said : ' there was a discussion of the laws were and she was released in the end because it was a cultural practice , but i say if it harms kids then it should be against the law			0
' the @entity95 ( @entity95 ) said the practice was known to them , and that any reports of it would be treated as a form of child abuse and passed to the @entity101 so a case could be built			0
as well as being excruciatingly painful , breast - ironing can cause problems including burns , abscesses , an inability to breastfeed , cysts and permanent disfigurement			1
@entity8 's @entity110 , @entity111 , says it is ' only a matter of time ' before a prosecution over female genital mutilation is brought it also damages the girl 's confidence			2
the campaigner added : ' i have seen girls become shy and withdrawn because of it			0
they are too afraid to get undressed in front of anyone because they have been so disfigured			0
' there are more than 200 ethnic groups in @entity19 with different customs , but all of them are said practise breast - ironing , using hot objects including stones or coconut shells			1
the aim is to make the girls less desirable to men , and thereby protect them from unwanted sexual advances , disease or even pregnancy			2
in a country where marriage at 13 is common , mothers mutilate their daughters to give them a chance of studying for longer			0
the @entity148 , which estimates that 3.8m pubescent girls are affected by the custom , says the practice is more common in the @entity153 and animist south of @entity19 than in the @entity155 north , because @entity153 mothers are keener to see their daughters educated before they are married off			2
female genital mutilation ( @entity78 ) , or female circumsion , in which a young girl 's clitoris is cut off because it gives sexual pleasure , is illegal in the @entity8 but affects thousands of young girls here , according to research			2
one report said 2,000 girls had sought help at @entity36 hospitals in just three years after undergoing @entity78			0
a practice associated with communities in @entity7 , particularly @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177 , its defenders say it is a cultural ritual			0
but it leaves young girls in pain , disfigured , open to infection and unable to enjoy sex			2
earlier this month director of public prosecutions @entity111 said it was ' only a matter of time ' before a prosecution was brought for @entity78			0
' i think a prosecution is much closer now than it 's been at any stage since this was made a criminal offence in this country , ' he said .			0

@entity195 girls ' chests are flattened protect them from rape or pregnancy
a common custom in @entity19 , it 's now said to be practised in the @entity8
campaigner @entity38 says : ' of course it 's happening here '
@entity95 says it 's aware of breast - ironing here
girls are permanently disfigured , and can suffer burns , cysts and infection
