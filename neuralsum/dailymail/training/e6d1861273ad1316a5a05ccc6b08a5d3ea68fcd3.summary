@entity1 team principal @entity0 is adamant @entity2 can still be caught in this year 's formula one world championship			1
@entity0 points out after six grands prix the dominance of @entity2 has left them just 18 points shy of a maximum score , with 240 from a potential 258			1
five consecutive one - twos have propelled @entity2 into a 141 - point lead over @entity1 in the constructors ' championship going into sunday 's @entity13 , a seemingly insurmountable hurdle even with 13 races remaining			1
trail : @entity1 are 141 points behind runaway leaders @entity2 in the constructors ' championship catch me if you can : @entity1 driver @entity23 during the third practice session ahead of sunday 's @entity25 @entity13 mix : @entity27 ( left ) , @entity0 ( centre ) and @entity29 together ahead of the @entity25 @entity13 belief : @entity0 is convinced all is not lost and @entity23 ( pictured ) can put @entity2 under pressure @entity0 , though , is convinced all is not lost and that a fifth world title is not beyond his team			1
when asked as to what fuelled his belief , @entity0 said : ' just looking at what we 've achieved over the past four years , the quality of the team we have			1
' nobody is giving up , nobody is chucking in the towel			2
' yeah , we 've a mountain to climb , and take nothing away from @entity2 who have done an incredible job this year			1
' but as we 've seen in previous years , like in 2012 when we had a difficult start , we managed to turn that situation around and get ourselves back into that championship			0
' the task here is certainly bigger than that , but nobody is giving up on anything			0
' as we saw in @entity56 ( the last grand prix ) we started to put them under a little bit of pressure			0
' @entity0 , however , knows after the problems power unit supplier @entity63 experienced in pre-season , @entity1 have since been playing catch up			1
while @entity1 and @entity63 have made significant strides , being on the back foot has resulted in @entity2 ' runaway start to the season			1
@entity2 : @entity70 ( left ) and @entity71 have had five straight one - twos so far at the top : @entity71 ( pictured ) and @entity2 team - mate @entity70 lead the way in the standings @entity0 , dismissing the idea that thoughts were already turning to next year , added : ' we 're not choosing to look at it like that			1
' obviously @entity63 have to start thinking about next year because they have to again submit the elements they can change within their design			2
' of course , what they learn this year is absolutely relevant to next year			2
' so our focus at the moment is very much on each race as it comes , developing the car as best we can and trying to reduce the gap			0
' @entity63 fully understand the predicament they are in			0
@entity92 ( ceo ) was in @entity93 to look and see for himself			0
' there are no ultimatums to @entity63 , other than we want to improve as quickly as we can			0
' we 've enjoyed a great deal of success with them over the years			0
all our race victories and world championships have been with @entity63 engines , and we trust in them to sort out their issues			0
' it is why @entity1 will not be jumping ship to another power unit supplier , as recent speculation has suggested			0
' not at this point in time , ' asserted @entity0			2
' one hundred per cent next year we will be powered by a @entity63 engine			2
