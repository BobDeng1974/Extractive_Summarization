by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 's dream of back - to - back promotions is still alive after they booked their place in the @entity7 play - off final at @entity8 by beating @entity9 3 - 1 in a blockbusting semi-final second leg			1
the @entity12 , who won automatic promotion from @entity15 last year , have had a magnificent season but they saved one of their best performances for the most important night and prospered thanks to goals from @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23			1
@entity3 boss @entity24 was forced to usher ecstatic fans off the pitch when they ran on before the final whistle , but he could not hold back the jubilant hordes when their place at @entity8 was confirmed			1
going to @entity8 : @entity23 celebrates scoring @entity3 's third goal in the play - off win against @entity9 packed out : @entity3 fans staged a pitch invasion at the end of the game man of the people : @entity3 's @entity38 finds leaving the pitch harder than expected heroes : @entity3 can gain back - to - back promotions if they beat @entity42 at @entity8 on may 25 party animal : @entity24 led the @entity3 celebrations in the directors ' box on the edge : @entity24 is supported as he waves to the @entity3 fans on the pitch below it was a trademark display of attacking endeavour , orchestrated by the influential @entity52 , which could have yielded a bigger winning margin but was enough to set up a date at the home of football with @entity42			1
@entity58 's men more than played their part in an enthralling clash as they took the lead early on through @entity63 's free - kick and then twice hit the woodwork in their attempts to get back into it though @entity67 and @entity68			1
but @entity69 , who were among the pre-season favourites to go up , will now spend a fourth season in @entity7			2
the tie was finely poised after saturday 's 1 - 1 first leg draw at @entity75 , but after a cagey opening the visitors seized the advantage in the 16th minute			0
@entity3 defender @entity79 needlessly fouled @entity68 and from the resulting free - kick 30 yards out @entity63 's dangerous delivery evaded everyone , creeping into the far corner			2
however , the @entity12 ' response was swift and after @entity79 should have atoned for his error almost immediately with a header that was superbly saved by @entity88 , they levelled in the 24th minute			0
from a free - kick in a similar position to @entity9 's @entity91 whipped in an equally delicious centre , which @entity21 got a flying header to and it sailed through the hands of @entity88			2
that quick riposte gave the @entity12 the impetus and again thanks to @entity91 's incisive left foot they took the lead 10 minutes before the break			0
the midfielder , who attracted interest from @entity101 earlier in the season , was afforded time and space on the left and sent in a pinpoint delivery which a late - arriving @entity22 superbly headed in off the post			0
in front : @entity9 took the lead early on thanks to @entity63 's goal but were then outclassed fightback : @entity21 got the hosts back on level terms less than 10 minutes after @entity9 's opener heads in front : @entity22 then scored to put @entity3 2 - 1 up before half - time game over : @entity23 made sure of the victory by adding a third goal for @entity3 in the 67th minute the game was now completely open and @entity9 had several chances to claw themselves level before the break , but @entity68 and @entity63 both shot over			1
and the @entity12 ' biggest escape came on the stroke of the interval , goalkeeper @entity124 left to thank a higher power as he inexplicably allowed @entity130 's shot to slip through his grasp but he breathed a huge sigh of relief as it dropped just wide			0
the see - saw nature of the clash continued into the second half and @entity91 almost put his side further ahead , but his sweet volley crashed into the bar while @entity69 's top scorer @entity68 went close to emulating his superb first - leg volley with an effort at the back post from @entity63 's cross which flew over			2
after @entity63 wasted a free header from 12 yards the @entity12 put one foot on @entity146 in the 67th minute thanks to @entity23 's 26th goal of the season			0
but his strike owed much to the creativity of @entity38 who foraged down the right , twisted @entity153 inside and out and rolled the ball across for @entity23 to turn into the bottom corner			0
@entity9 did not lie down as they desperately tried to mount a recovery , @entity67 's 35 - yard effort clipping a defender on the way through and crashing into the upright before @entity68 endured a similar fate , as the @entity12 did enough to win			0
out of luck : @entity9 boss @entity58 has got teams promoted from @entity7 three times before job well done : @entity3 boss @entity24 contests a decision during his side 's win against @entity9 staying put : @entity9 and @entity170 are now resigned to another season in @entity7 lights , camera : while @entity3 will face @entity42 at @entity8 on may 25			1

@entity3 fight back from a goal down to beat @entity9 in @entity7 play - offs
they will now face @entity42 on may 25 for a place in the *championship*
@entity24 ' side only gained promotion from @entity15 last year
@entity9 boss @entity58 will not add a fourth promotion to his *cv* this season
