by @entity0 from @entity2 's embrace of graphic artist @entity3 to @entity5 's emphasis on pop art prints , fashion that nods to the art world is bang on trend			0
but although it might appear to be a modern phenomenon , fashion 's love affair with art began more than a century ago , with @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 among the names to have turned their hand to textile design , now creations by @entity16 , @entity14 and @entity15 are to join pieces by @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity25 sculptor @entity24 in a stunning new exhibition opening tomorrow			1
wearable art : ‘ ballerina ’ , a screen - printed silk scarf designed by @entity16 for @entity30 circa 1947 artist textiles : @entity15 to @entity14 documents fashion 's early fascination with art and includes designs by @entity14 that , until recently , languished in the attic of a family of @entity39 decorators			1
the creations , which include a delicate pattern of repeating blue butterflies , were unearthed by curator @entity43 , and were commissioned by fabric companies eager to sell their customers a wearable piece of modern art. ' the @entity14 pieces are extremely rare due to them having been lost for so many years and only recently having been discovered , ' explains @entity50			1
' @entity14 was already engaged with graphic design , so textile design was another string to his bow , ' he adds			1
' whether it was a record cover for the @entity57 or a textile for @entity60 fabrics , @entity14 was always willing to satisfy any paying customer			2
' spectacular : designs by @entity64 ( left ) and @entity65 ( right ) for @entity66 talented : @entity16 , pictured during a 1959 visit to @entity68 , designed several sets of textiles and he was n't the only one			1
@entity72 surrealist @entity16 and @entity74 costume designer @entity73 both created work for @entity39 based @entity76 , while in 1947 , @entity23 designed a limited edition pattern for @entity78			1
other artists to cash in on their talents included @entity15 , who , in a coup for @entity83 boss , @entity60 , agreed to contribute to the company 's ' @entity85 ' series			2
although initially reluctant , by the 1960s , shoppers were able to purchase @entity15 - designed textiles that could be used for almost anything , with the single exception of upholstery			2
as @entity50 puts it : ' picassos may be leaned against , but not sat on			0
' talent : although @entity15 ( left ) was picky about the use his designs were put to , anything went for @entity14 delicate : one of the four headsquares designed by @entity100 for @entity101 , 1944 by contrast , @entity14 was happy for his work to be put to any use the new owners required and went on to become one of the most referenced artists of the 20th century			1
' @entity14 continually influences designers , ' adds @entity50			2
' the bright colours and blotted ink lines are very fashionable both in textile design , illustration and graphics			0
' and @entity50 is n't wrong			0
more than 60 years after he first appeared on the scene , all it takes is a swift look at @entity5 's latest collection to see that @entity14 's talent for textiles remains as influential as ever			0
artist textiles : @entity15 to @entity14 opens tomorrow at the @entity121			1
tickets cost £ 8 for adults , concessions £ 6.50			0
