mr @entity0 attacked the shadow cabinet minister for an interview he gave criticising the former @entity2 leader ’s failure to confront @entity13 ’s ballooning deficit in the run up to the 2010 election			1
mr @entity1 said mr @entity0 ’s refusal to even talk about @entity17 ‘ cuts ’ was still costing @entity2 support , because it made the party look like it did not care about the deficit			1
@entity2 are currently 25 points behind the @entity22 on which party is best for the economy			0
the former prime minister told mr @entity1 that he should not accept @entity34 claims that @entity2 was spending too much before the last general election , a senior @entity2 source revealed			1
the source said : ‘ he still can not accept @entity2 was running a structural deficit			2
even after all this time he wo n’t accept that he was wrong – it ’s unbelievable			0
’ the deficit – the difference between government spending and how much it raises in taxes each year – was more than £ 160 billion in 2010			0
@entity2 blamed the huge borrowing splurge on the global recession – because the government was forced to withstand a huge hit on tax revenue as people lost their jobs , while at the same time increasing spending on benefits			0
but analysis has since revealed that the ‘ structural deficit ’ – the amount of borrowing needed even when the economy is growing normally – had grown to more than £ 100 billion in the last year of the @entity2 government			0
in an interview with @entity59 , published this month , mr @entity1 said mr @entity0 ’s refusal to face up to the deficit was still hurting the @entity2			1
he said : ‘ my view is that the seeds were sown under the last government and @entity66 - for whom i have a lot of respect - his refusal to use the word “ cuts ” in trying to frame the economic debate as investment versus cuts gave the impression we did n't understand that debt and deficit would have to be dealt with			1
’ shadow chancellor @entity78 ( left ) and the @entity2 leader @entity79 ( right ) , who were both @entity81 aides under @entity0 , have defended the party 's record controlling government spending a source close to mr @entity1 confirmed the pair spoke in a telephone call after the interview was published earlier this month			1
the source said : ‘ it is something they disagree on			0
‘ @entity1 ’s argument has always been that pursuing the line that it was @entity2 spending versus @entity34 cuts allowed @entity97 to make the whole election debate about deficit reduction			2
they spoke and that is definitely still his view			0
’ a spokesman for mr @entity1 said : ' @entity1 and @entity66 are both members of the @entity105 - or course they speak to each other on a range of issues			2
@entity1 has great respect for @entity66			0
' it is understood that on this occasion mr @entity1 initiated the call			2
conservative mp @entity114 said the confrontation between mr @entity0 and mr @entity1 revealed a ' divided ' @entity2			1
