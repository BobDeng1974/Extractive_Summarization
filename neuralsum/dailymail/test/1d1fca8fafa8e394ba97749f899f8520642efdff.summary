reading manager @entity0 insists the @entity2 needs protecting after some dubious scheduling decisions			1
earlier in the competition the @entity5 ties were split over five days due to @entity8 matches and to accommodate televised games			2
@entity10 had to play their @entity2 replay against @entity12 in the last round on a monday when they had played a @entity16 match two days previously			1
@entity0 wants scheduling of matches in @entity19 to improve so the @entity2 can be preserved should they progress to the final , that will be contested on may 30 leaving @entity0 ’s side almost a month without games when the @entity16 season ends on may 2			1
the massive @entity8 match between @entity27 and @entity28 is also scheduled to be televised at the same time as their semi-final against @entity31 at @entity32 on saturday			1
@entity0 claimed he ‘ could n’t care less ’ about the conflicting match , but added : ‘ i thought it was a shame in the last round when we had to play on a monday night after playing on a saturday			1
@entity10 beat @entity12 in the last round but face a much tougher task when they face @entity31 at @entity32 ' there are things that we should do to protect this great competition			2
‘ when we beat @entity31 , we have to wait four weeks after our last league game to play the cup final , this is also not correct			0
' i probably need to go on holiday for two of them and then bring the team back in			0
it 's a long break			2
‘ if we get to the final , what are we going to do from may 2 to may 30 ? what do we do ? everyone else has played , so we wo n't be playing games			0
' it 'd be a great puzzle to have though			0
let ’s talk about it on saturday night			0
’ @entity10 defender @entity62 revealed the players are waiting until after the match on saturday before booking any time off in may in case they beat @entity31			2
‘ holidays are off until now , you ca n’t book anything , you ’ve got to just see where you are and it would be great , ’ he said			0
‘ we ’re all committed and dedicated to getting to this final			0
’ @entity72 's side are in formidable form and beating them will be a tough ask for the @entity10			1

@entity0 thinks that scheduling needs to better for the @entity2
@entity10 's semi-final *clashes* with @entity27 against @entity28
@entity0 admits that without improvements , the @entity2 will lose its *appeal*
