@entity0 admits @entity1 have been handed a run - in from hell by the fixture computer but is aiming to replicate @entity6 ’s thriving finish in similar circumstances last season as he takes control at the @entity10			1
the new head coach has challenged his players to get the club to safety as quickly as possible so the final five matches against @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 are rendered largely inconsequential			2
@entity1 ’s run - in echoes that endured by @entity22 last season when they faced @entity16 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 and collected only one point and were relegated			1
‘ it ’s the @entity36 so straight away there are an awful lot of very , very tough games , ’ he said			2
‘ it ’s a difficult end to the season that ’s for sure , but you ’ve got to play everyone anyway			1
‘ getting safe before then would be helpful that ’s for sure			2
but that ’s what you ’ d be aiming to do			0
you want to be in a really good place as quickly as possible			0
‘ you look at @entity6 ’s end to the season as opposed to @entity22 ’s and of course they produced some outstanding results against the top teams			1
’ flying @entity6 : @entity55 rose to the occasion to survive a difficult run - in last season @entity59 is already under pressure from fans angry at his appointment , given his two previous managerial roles – at @entity66 and @entity67 – were not in the @entity36 and ended with the sack			1
but the 55 - year - old , who moves from head of @entity29 ’s academy , defended his standing in the game			1
‘ i understand i would n’t have been the name of everybody lips but i ’ve got this job now , ’ he said			0
‘ i know the @entity1 fans are incredibly passionate but i ’m incredibly passionate – hopefully together we can have success			1
‘ the only way i can do that is by winning games			0
every single manager or head coach will be judged on results on the pitch			0
unfortunately that wo n’t happen for a number of weeks but it does give me time to work with the players and get them ready			0
my passion is for coaching			0
’ @entity92 : @entity22 were not able survive a challenging climax to the season and were relegated he will also need to work quickly in the transfer market with @entity1 ’s squad threadbare			1
‘ we ’ve got 16 players and three of them are goalkeepers so that won ’ t be enough for a @entity36 season , ’ he said			1
‘ we have to get more players in			0
we have some good players in the squad but it needs to be supplemented			0
‘ there are n’t any fullbacks at the club , a shortage of wide players , we have three senior centre - backs , we do n’t have a lot of senior strikers			2
there are areas we need to address but it ’s got to be quality			0
