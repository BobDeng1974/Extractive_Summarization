a vaccine against deadly meningitis b was yesterday approved by experts – but may not be available on the @entity3 before the end of the year			1
until then , families will have to go private for the jab , the first to prevent the form of meningitis which kills hundreds annually – with half the deaths among under - 5s			1
the @entity11 has found the vaccine – called @entity13 – safe and effective for infants aged two months and over and older children			1
the vaccine is the first to prevent the leading cause of life - threatening bacterial meningitis in the @entity19 , which is expected to dramatically cut the toll of death and disability among children but it will not become immediately available on the @entity3			1
the government ’s advisory committee on vaccination has not decided whether the jab will become part of the @entity3 routine immunisation programme			1
health campaigners fear it could take until the summer or even until the end of the year for a ruling			0
@entity35 founder @entity35 , who lost his 14 - month - old son @entity38 to meningitis and septicaemia in 1982 , said : ‘ this ground - breaking vaccine is the most important development since i lost my son to meningitis 30 years ago			1
‘ the government must introduce the vaccine into the immunisation schedule as soon as possible – it will save thousands of lives and spare families so much suffering			2
any delay means lives will be lost			0
’ the @entity52 ( @entity52 ) , which advises the government , must first recommend @entity54 and decide which age groups should receive it			0
it is likely to be given as routine jabs for babies from age two months in three doses , with a booster at one year , plus an initial catch - up programme for toddlers and teenagers aged 15 - 18			1
the @entity52 will consider factors such as price , cost - effectiveness and compatibility with other vaccines			2
@entity70 ( pictured ) is the most common form of bacterial meningitis in this country and one of the most deadly			1
it poses the toughest challenge for scientists because there are so many strains to target the committee has discussed the vaccine before , but there is no deadline set for agreement			2
it took five years for the last major jab against meningitis – the pneumococcal vaccine – to be introduced into the immunisation schedule			1
a mother who lost her 10 - month old son wants the new vaccine to be approved by the @entity3 as soon as possible			1
@entity93 died on christmas day 2011 just hours after contracting meningitis b and septicaemia			2
the baby boy seemed his usual happy self on the morning of @entity98 , but hours later he became lethargic and sick			0
@entity99 and @entity100 took him straight to @entity101 , where 40 minutes later he developed a rash all over his body			0
at 2.20am on christmas day , doctors delivered the devastating news that @entity93 could not be saved			0
the @entity106 , of @entity107 , @entity108 , support the beat it now campaign by @entity35 for the jab to be introduced on the @entity3			1
mrs @entity93 , 29 , said : ‘ @entity112 absolutely shattered our lives within hours			0
‘ there ’s no need for debate			0
the government needs to act			0
no parents should have to go through our ordeal			2
‘ it ’s important that the vaccine is brought in as soon as possible			2
it ’s the difference between life and death			2
’ @entity54 will be available privately in the ‘ middle of the year ’ when supplies are released by makers @entity128			0
no price has been set			0
a meningitis c jab costs the @entity3 £ 7.50 , which may be indicative of the new jab ’s price			1
@entity133 is the most common form of bacterial meningitis in @entity19 and one of the most deadly			1
there are 1,870 cases on average each year , resulting in up to 200 deaths – with half the fatalities in those aged under five			0
up to 400 children are left with major life - long complications such as limb amputations , blindness , deafness and brain damage			1
although vaccination programmes have been introduced to combat pneumococcal meningitis and the strains c and @entity154 , no b vaccine currently exists in this country			1
in trials in @entity157 involving 7,500 children , adolescents and adults , @entity54 produced antibodies against at least 73 per cent of 1,000 meningitis b strains found			2
@entity163 of the @entity164 said @entity166 approval was a ‘ significant milestone in the fight against meningitis ’ but urged a swift decision by @entity19 authorities			0
she said : ‘ it ’s wonderful news that this new vaccine has been licensed , but licensing alone will not save lives			0
' that will only happen when the @entity52 recommends the vaccine is introduced into the @entity178 , and the government agrees and implements this recommendation			0
‘ with vaccines being the only way to protect against bacterial meningitis , the sooner this happens the better			0
’ a @entity185 spokesman said : ‘ meningitis is a worry for many parents so we ’re pleased that a meningococcal b vaccine has now been licensed			1
‘ our independent group of vaccination experts , the @entity52 , is looking at the use of this vaccine and will provide advice in due course			0

there is currently no *defence* against meningitis b - the most deadly strain
move expected to dramatically cut the death and disability toll in children
yet @entity13 vaccine will not become immediately available on the @entity3
parents wanting protection for their babies will have to *buy* it privately
