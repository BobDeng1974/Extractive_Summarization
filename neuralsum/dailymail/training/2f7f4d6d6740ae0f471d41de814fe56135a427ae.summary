the @entity9 seeks to upgrade standards for child seats for children weighing up to 40 pounds to include a new test that simulates a side crash			1
the agency estimates the standards will prevent the deaths of about five children and injuries to 64 others each year			2
improvements : the @entity9 seeks to upgrade standards for child seats for children weighing up to 40 pounds to include a new test that simulates a side crash @entity9 acting administrator @entity27 is scheduled to announce the proposal wednesday			1
under the proposal , the new tests will simulate a ' t - bone ' crash , where the front of a vehicle traveling 30 mph strikes the side of a small passenger vehicle traveling at 15 mph			1
the tests will position the car seat on a sled , with another sled ramming the side of the sled with the seat , rather than using actual vehicles since the aim is n't to test the crash worthiness of specific vehicles , @entity9 officials said			2
research shows that most child deaths and injuries in side - impact crashes involve a car carrying children that is stopped at an intersection , usually at a light or stop sign , officials said			1
when the car begins to accelerate to go through the intersection , it is struck in the side by a vehicle traveling at a higher rate of speed on the cross street			0
the side - impact test - the first of its kind - simulates both the acceleration of the struck vehicle and the vehicle 's door crushing inward toward the car seat			2
new developments : besides using a 12 - month - old child dummy already approved under @entity9 standards , the proposed test will also utilize a to - be - developed side - impact dummy representing a 3 - year - old child besides using a 12 - month - old child dummy already approved under @entity9 standards , the proposed test will also utilize a to - be - developed side - impact dummy representing a 3 - year - old child			1
' as a father of two , i know the peace of mind this proposed test will give parents , ' transportation secretary @entity82 said in a statement			0
the test ' will give parents and car seat makers important new data on how car seats perform in side crashes			0
' @entity27 called car seats ' an essential tool for keeping young children safe in vehicles and have a proven track record of saving lives			0
' safety advocates have long sought tougher standards for car seats to protect against side - impact crashes			1
' i think this is terrific , ' said @entity107 , who was the @entity9 administrator during the @entity109 administration and later president of @entity111			0
she noted that today 's passenger vehicles have eight air bags , in part to protect adults from side - impact crashes			1
' we have an absolute moral obligation to protect children as well , ' she said			0
@entity9 's estimates of the number of lives that will be saved and injuries prevented by the proposed standards are ' very , very conservative , ' @entity107 said			2
accident : under the proposal , the new tests will simulate a ' t - bone ' crash , where the front of a vehicle traveling 30 mph strikes the side of a small passenger vehicle traveling at 15 mph the public will have 90 days to comment on the proposed regulations after they are published this week			1
the regulations wo n't be made final until after the agency has reviewed the comments and answered any important issues that may be raised			0
that typically takes months and sometimes years , although @entity9 officials said they hope to move quickly			0
the proposal includes giving car seat manufacturers three years to make any adjustments to meet the new requirements			0
that window does n't begin until the regulations are made final .			0

proposed government regulations would upgrade standards for child car seats in side - impact crashes
@entity9 estimates standards will prevent the deaths of about five children and 64 injuries each year
@entity159 administrator believes this number is ' very , very conservative '
new tests will simulate ' t - bone ' crash , where the front of a vehicle traveling 30 mph strikes the side of a vehicle traveling at 15 mph
