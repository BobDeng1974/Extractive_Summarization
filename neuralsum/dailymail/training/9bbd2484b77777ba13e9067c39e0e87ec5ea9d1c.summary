by @entity0 published : 09:36 est , 16 january 2013 updated : 04:11 est , 18 january 2013 a missing cat survived a 1,700 - mile journey while being trapped in the undercarriage of an inter-city train			1
@entity5 spent two days trapped under the front carriage as the @entity8 train made a series of trips between @entity11 , the @entity12 and @entity13			1
the tabby was only discovered after train manager @entity15 heard meowing when the train stopped briefly on its way to @entity18			1
she suffered a badly - broken leg during the ordeal , which later had to be amputated			1
vets said by the state of her injuries @entity5 may have been trapped for even longer			2
ms @entity39 , 33 , said the cat could only have got into the sealed unit when the panels were removed for maintenance at the shunting depot near her home			0
she said : ' she was in surprisingly good condition and her coat was very shiny , although she was incredibly smelly from her infected leg			0
@entity5 's leg was so badly broken that vets had no choice but to amputate but she is now recovering rescuers : @entity15 , @entity56 , left , discovered @entity5 before veterinary surgeon @entity57 , right , operated and amputated the cat 's leg @entity5 was found on a @entity8 train on the line from @entity56 to @entity62 ' she was very friendly and when i made a couple of @entity65 calls she could be heard purring in the background			1
' it 's amazing how she survived for so long - i think she climbed into the train as she was after rats in the shunting yard			1
' @entity5 disappeared from her home three weeks ago before finding herself locked inside the train			1
the 06.51 service from @entity29 to @entity62 set off on thursday , january 10 , and then travelled from the capital to @entity75			0
it then headed back to @entity62 later in the day before ending the day in @entity77 via @entity78 , @entity79			0
the following day the same train went back to @entity62 via @entity81 and @entity82 before completing another run to @entity75 and back to @entity11			1
finally it left @entity62 at 19.03 on friday heading for @entity56 in @entity18 nearly six hours away			0
@entity5 was eventually found late on friday evening when ms @entity39 heard the distressed cat			1
ms @entity39 said she first thought the noise was a fault with the air suspension and went onto platform to check			0
miraculous : @entity5 amazingly survived the 1,700 mile train trip that took her on a number of round trips between @entity11 and @entity75 before eventually being discovered in @entity56 @entity5 survived without food and water but is now recovering and will soon be reunited with her owners she saw no sign of the cat and the train carried on into the night but she heard the meowing again at the next stop at @entity103			1
the train could only wait temporarily there because part of it was on the @entity108 but at the next station at @entity110 and the driver got out where they pinpointed the noise and were able to pull her out			2
ms @entity115 her on board and fed her tuna from a sandwich from the train 's buffet and put her in a box in her compartment before calling the @entity124			0
on - call vet @entity125 said the cat was in such a bad state that he thought she was a stray and was preparing to put her down			2
however he checked for a microchip and found that she belonged to retired train driver @entity130 , 84 , and his wife @entity131 , 82 , who gave permission for @entity5 's front right paw to be amputated			1
the cat is now recovering from her ordeal and operation at the @entity137 in @entity56 and is expected to return home with a few days			2
@entity5 's meows were heard by @entity15 when her train pulled into @entity56 mr @entity125 said @entity5 could have been trapped for even longer because the fracture to her leg was ' easily four or five days ' old '			1
mrs @entity143 said : ' @entity5 dashed out of the back door and we thought she 'd gone for good			2
' we missed her and were very surprised when the cattery rang to say she 'd been found and was in @entity56			0
' she 's lost her front paw and is now on antibiotics and resting but we ca n't wait to have her back - she 's certainly seen more of the country than we have			0
' train operators @entity8 added : ' we 're pretty sure the cat had been stuck on board for some time			2
' it was ensconced in the underbelly of the train and it could n't have got in there unless the train was in a depot or static for a considerable period of time			0
' that part of the train is n't accessible from a normal station stop so the latest it could realistically have stowed away would have been at @entity29 where it started service			0
' we 've calculated it did at least 1,667 miles but luckily we managed to get it to a vet and it 's going to have a happy ending by going home			0
