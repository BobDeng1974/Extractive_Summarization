by @entity0 for @entity1 political leaders are to study an award - winning plan to create around 3.5million new homes by expanding up to 40 towns and cities			1
planner @entity8 was awarded the @entity9 this week for his idea to double the size of existing towns and cities by building more than 80,000 homes in ' garden cities ' in the green belt			1
party leaders are now said to be taking an interest in his ideas after he won the respected competition - the second biggest economics prize in the world after the @entity23			2
the new developments are shown in lighter colours to the north west , east and south west of the existing city mr @entity8 beat nearly 300 entrants to the prize and his ideas are now likely to be viewed by political leaders mr @entity8 proposed expanding a fictional city he called @entity39 , loosely modelled on @entity40 , using the principles of the garden city movement of the 1890s			1
he says towns with existing populations of around 150,000 people could each be expanded to provide around 86,000 new homes for another 150,000 more people over the next 30 to 35 years			0
mr @entity8 says the opposition of locals to large housing developments could be overcome by concentrating the majority of new buildings in one area and protecting others praising his plan , prize founder @entity56 of @entity57 , who is known to be close to chancellor @entity58 , said : ' we urgently need to build more houses and great places in @entity30			1
' @entity8 's entry is a tour de force of economic and financial analysis , creative thinking and bold , daring ideas			0
' @entity68 and the @entity69 are believed to be keen on the idea of new garden cities to meet the spiralling demand for homes in @entity30			2
the plan is based around the idea of garden cities , like that built in @entity77 , @entity78 a century ago the idea of garden cities , like @entity80 ( pictured ) , is for homes scattered between parks and public gardens @entity58 unveiled plans for a 15,000 garden city in @entity86 , @entity87 earlier this year , but some @entity88 are wary of idea , fearing large house - building projects may lose them votes in rural towns and cities			1
