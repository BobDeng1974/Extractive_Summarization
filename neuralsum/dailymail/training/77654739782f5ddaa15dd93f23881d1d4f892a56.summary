' @entity1 was a boat taking him away from @entity4 ' are the rather florid words - particularly for a football agent , you might suggest ? - chosen to describe the incredible journey of an equally amazing footballer , @entity9			1
poetic licence aside , there also happens to be an element of truth in them			0
because as new @entity21 documentary , ' the making of @entity9 ' ( timed to pre-empt their coverage of the 2014 @entity19 ceremony ) tells us , it was the dogged determination of this small - island boy to leave behind his home and his family and chase his football dream , that turned him into the global superstar we know today			1
as we discover in this thorough examination of @entity9 's formative years , he was never just a child prodigy simply waiting for his destiny to fulfil itself			1
meticulously researched and delivered by celebrated @entity34 football journalist @entity33 , ' the making of @entity9 ' makes it perfectly clear that the young man was personally responsible for making his own good luck			1
or as one of his first coaches at the @entity4 club @entity41 puts it , ' only 20 or 30 per cent was natural ability '			0
a documentary about @entity9 's rise , ' the making of @entity9 ' , aired on @entity21 on sunday a young @entity9 is photographed while in his accommodation during his time at @entity48 the @entity50 winger celebrates scoring a goal for @entity52 in 2012 and the reigning @entity19 holder celebrates scoring for @entity48 's youth side @entity9 also dazzled @entity56 crowds earlier in his career while at @entity58 yet he was also ' the star and leader '			1
this desire to turn himself into something more special than anybody else is underlined all the way through the programme			2
early on , his childhood friend @entity66 is filmed on the distinctly poor street where they played football , and the young @entity9 began to live his dream			1
' you could only play short passes ' , he pointed out from a cramped concrete strip they called a pitch			0
' but he could beat players the length of it			0
' from here on in , we hear from a succession of men , all of who had a hand , in some way , in his future , and all of who again underline the unique commitment he displayed			0
not least of which when , at the tender age of 11 , he left his family behind on @entity4 to make the big leap and join @entity48 's academy			1
here , we discover , he was around three or four years younger than his fellow football students			0
but it did n't take long for then head coach @entity96 to commit to keeping him at the club			0
he tells the tale of how on the second day of his week - long trial , @entity96 was told by his fellow coaches to check this eleven - year - old out			2
@entity9 holds aloft the @entity19 trophy , which he claimed last january and hopes to retain former @entity48 director of football @entity102 says @entity9 told him he would be the best in the world @entity9 moved to @entity41 in 1995 before heading to @entity48 in 1997 the winger takes a shot for @entity48 , a club he spent five years at before leaving for @entity56 @entity9 moved to @entity41 , a club on the island of @entity4 , in order to further his footballing education he then explains that , at a throw in , @entity9 turned to a boy at least three years his senior who was marking him a little too tightly , and said ' hey kid , calm down '			1
it was , says @entity96 , the moment @entity9 was in			2
but he was still only a child and this separation from heart and home was proving the ruination of even older boys than him			0
' the toughest days are birthdays ' one dad tells us of his own son 's absence to further his football life			2
while former @entity127 football favourite @entity126 , now a coach at @entity48 , also points out that some boys can ' get lost ' in the big city , before adding ' it 's cruel to have to choose at 12 or 13 , but it 's how you get your start '			2
this was n't lost on young @entity9 and in spite of some homesickness and occasional waywardness , he continued with his quest to be better than the rest			2
@entity9 ( right ) took himself away from his comfort zone in order to develop as a footballer during training @entity9 ( left ) has water poured over him by a @entity48 team - mate @entity9 was football mad from a very young age and he started at @entity149 before moving to @entity41 ' i will be the best footballer in the world , ' @entity48 's sporting director @entity102 tells us he told him			1
and @entity102 had no reason to disagree			0
especially when for instance , as he points out , ' the security people would have to close the doors , and turn the lights out in the gym ' to prevent him taking the extra sessions he thought would help set him apart from the rest			0
' the making of @entity9 ' contains a wealth of first - hand testimony from those that were part of the story ... as well as a few interesting glimpses at the places the kid stopped off at along the way			1
however , it does rather lack a physical presence to walk us through the story - @entity174 is more often than not , unseen and unheard - and as such it does feel rather like an extended news report			0
nevertheless , such is the strength of the journalism , you are never in doubt that what we 're hearing is the inside track on the promising young boy who became a footballing @entity186			0
and if - as we see him doing in the last picture of the documentary - ronaldo once again lifts football 's golden globe aloft , ' the making of @entity9 ' will have gone a long way as to reminding us why			1
@entity126 , who now works at @entity48 's youth academy , also features in the documentary a young @entity9 stands looking through the nets while on the pitch at @entity48 's training ground			1

@entity9 , @entity199 and @entity200 make up the final - three *shortlist* for the @entity19 , which will be *awarded* on monday night
