' i had had it in my purse i carry usually , and i thought " i ’m going to put that sucker away			2
" ' state police sgt. @entity41 told @entity43 that the single bullet was fired at 2.30pm on tuesday and was reported to police two hours later			0
the investigation has been concluded and they found no suspicious evidence to suggest that it was anything beyond an accident , nor did they find any fragments outside of the office			0

' i urge everyone to be extremely cautious with their firearm			0
i know from personal experience how easy it is to discharge a firearm accidentally .			0

state rep. @entity3 had a conceal - carry license so she was legally allowed to have the gun in the @entity63 building
said she was cleaning it because she wanted to put it away since she felt she did *n't* need it *anymore*
