by @entity0 published : 00:00 est , 26 november 2012 updated : 08:38 est , 27 november 2012 this is the story of how i woke monday to find myself the target of at least ten thousand angry @entity5 fans			1
the story begins less than 24 hours earlier on sunday afternoon , when i wrote an article about the online backlash ignited by the 18 - year - old pop sensation 's overalls , which he wore while accepting an award from @entity13 prime minister @entity12			1
the outfit , along with his backwards cap and neon yellow shoes , ignited outrage on the internet over whether his outfit was an appropriate presentation for a meeting with the prime minister			1
backlash : @entity5 's choice of wardrobe at a national ceremony with @entity13 prime minister @entity12 sparked outrage online @entity5 had earlier tweeted a photo of his outfit and wrote , ' i hope you hate my style			1
' critics said it was disrespectful			2
supporters said it was @entity5 being @entity5 and that he could wear whatever he wanted			1
trend - setter ? @entity5 tweeted , ' i hope you hate my outfit ' the @entity42 reported that he ' caused a scene ' with the outfit , while @entity45 gave him the moniker ' white trash prince ' and the @entity48 called him a ' twit			1
' on monday morning i had just jumped in the shower before work when the bathroom door flung open and in marched my boyfriend , who announced that my name was ' all over the @entity20 ' in reference to @entity5			2
he stuck his iphone through the shower curtain and showed me the texts he had received from friends overnight as well as a @entity5 fan page devoted to trashing my name			2
i shrugged and finished showering			0
then a few minutes later , curiosity got the best of me and i flipped open my laptop to @entity66 ' @entity0 and @entity5			2
' my jaw dropped at what i found			0
my @entity72 account and inbox were littered with threats from strangers , most of whom called me vile names that the @entity77 wo n't let me repeat in print			0
' you need to think about what you say , b * * * * , ' wrote @ kidrauhl			0
' f * * * you , ' wrote @ _ @entity84 _			0
' watch out , ' wrote another @entity72 user			0
others said : ' what a c word , ' ' come online d * * * * * bag , ' ' how do you feel about that article now f * * * * t , ' and ' prepare for the hate you asked for			2
' i did n't know whether to laugh or lock my door			0
it turns out @entity5 had responded directly to the article i wrote in a post on @entity98 , prompting his fans to track me down online and come at me with pitchforks raised			1
response : my @entity72 account and inbox were littered with threats from strangers , most of whom called me vile names that the @entity77 wo n't let me repeat in print outrage : ' you need to think about what you say , b * * * * , ' wrote @ kidrauhl			0
' f * * * you , ' wrote @ _ @entity84 _			0
' watch out , ' wrote another @entity72 user in @entity5 's response to my article , he said the photo of him accepting the award from @entity12 was taken in an arena where he would be performing			2
' i walked straight from my meet and greet to [ the prime minister ] , if you " @entity0 " expect me to have a change of clothes let a loan a suit at that specific time that ’s crazy , ' he wrote			1
' wow am i ever white trash hayley peterson lol			0
' it was @entity45 that branded him ' white trash prince , ' but that was lost in the fray and not worth clarifying			0
i had been thrust to the center of the dispute over the appropriateness of @entity5 's overalls , whether i liked it or not			1
by mid-noon monday , the strongly - worded threats from @entity5 's fans continued to multiply			1
while the messages came from seemingly harmless user names such as ' @entity143 ! ! ! ' and ' @entity144 , ' the vitriol from some still caught me off guard			0
@entity5 's response : ' i walked straight from my meet and greet to [ the prime minister ] , if you " @entity0 " expect me to have a change of clothes let a loan a suit at that specific time that ¿ s crazy , ' @entity5 wrote			1
' wow am i ever white trash hayley peterson lol ' before i started working for @entity158 last month , i spent a couple years in @entity159 as a @entity161 correspondent and presidential campaign reporter			1
i thought i had grown a pretty thick skin in that job			0
but nothing i did prepared me for an angry band of so - called ' @entity167			0
' perhaps most surprising , however , is that no article i wrote about president @entity169 or @entity170 ever garnered half as much attention as @entity5 's overalls .			1
