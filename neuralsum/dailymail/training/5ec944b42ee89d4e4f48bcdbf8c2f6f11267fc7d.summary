by @entity0 published : 04:37 est , 7 august 2012 updated : 01:47 est , 8 august 2012 there was a public outcry when it was revealed that the next @entity4 would get a new docking port connector			2
the newer , slimline port means that thousands of current @entity8 accessories will need a potentially clunky adapter to work with the ' @entity4 ' - or become unusable			1
now , latest leaks from the website @entity11 , which has strong sources ' close to @entity8 ' , suggest that the entire next generation of @entity16 , including the @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and future versions of the @entity19 , will use the new port			1
@entity8 is expected to refresh its @entity18 and @entity4 product line this @entity23 , and if the company sticks to its usual policy of annual upgrades , a new @entity19 can be expected next @entity27			1
change : this picture is believed to show a prototype case for the new @entity4 , with its new connector design which is set to make every existing accessory completely obsolete @entity32 and new : the current @entity4 is shown with the prototype of the @entity4 's outer casing @entity11 is consistently accurate with predictions about @entity8 's next moves , and suggest the announcement will be made at a launch event in @entity39 on wednesday , september 12			1
the site believes a special connector will be released to connect older accessories - such as docking stations and speakers - to newer versions of the range			0
many fans were left angry after images allegedly showing the @entity4 's new design leaked out , showing the traditional 30 - pin dock connector - used for charging , syncing files and pumping audio to hi - fis - had been re-designed into a smaller shape			0
popular : but @entity4 users could found themselves seriously out of pocket if they want to upgrade their device useless : the $ 850 @entity58 8 is designed to work with the current @entity4 's design the new port looks similar to micro usb , the standard supported by all other phone manufacturers - however it is very unlikely that @entity8 will support this standard , despite moves by the @entity67 to get all phone companies to rally around one type of cable			2
@entity8 's version has a triangle - shaped wedge at one end , which should stop users plugging in the cable the wrong way round			0
@entity79 fans may spot a superficial similarity to a @entity82 port , which is used to transfer raw video footage and larger files at high speed			0
obsolete : the @entity87 speaker , left , and the @entity88 10 , right , are other pricey gadgets which will have to be upgraded before they will work with the @entity4 the new port means older accessories will be rendered redundant unless adapters are released to make them compatible again - which is likely to be an ungainly solution , and may be impossible for some docks			1
the ' @entity98 ' slot , containing the sim card which connects a phone to the carrier network , has also been redesigned to be thinner , although this will be unlikely to cause much disruption to users as networks will provide replacements sims if necessary			0
there are also rumours , reported on @entity109 , that the @entity19 3 , which was released in the @entity27 , will get a slight tweak this autumn to brink the dock connector in - line with the rest of the range .			0

' all future @entity8 products ' will sport new connector port from september , according to leaked @entity8 reports
@entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and future @entity121 all set for updates
@entity124 renders *hundreds* of accessories obsolete without adapters
