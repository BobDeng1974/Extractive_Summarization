the @entity0 are in fantasy land at the start of 2014 , with their domestic game crumbling in front of them			1
the union ’s conduct in the bitter conflict with the regions amounts to a dereliction of duty and an act of wanton vandalism			2
when @entity14 confirmed on @entity15 that they would not sign a new participation agreement , it was an understandable stance given the lack of clarity about so many details			0
fantasy land : the @entity0 - based at the @entity21 ( above ) - are playing hardball with the regons yet , the @entity0 ’s response was extraordinary – hinting that they are ready to cut the @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 adrift , and create new professional teams			1
it is the latest example of gun - boat diplomacy in a turbulent season for @entity34 rugby			2
the regions are culpable to an extent , in failing to establish a firm basis for sustainable businesses and being over-reliant on central funding			2
however , the four teams have produced a stream of talented players for @entity14 and the @entity0 ’s reaction now is a power - play that could drive the regions to oblivion			1
yet , their alternative vision is ludicrously far - fetched			2
after a meeting of the union ’s board on thursday , it was announced that they will soon present the regions with a new draft agreement , understood to contain a tiered payment scheme based on the creation and retention of @entity57 players			0
but , if this ploy fails , it is thought that the @entity0 ’s fall - back plan is to create new professional teams , potentially based in @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and at the @entity21			1
this sporting miracle must take place in six months , to support the @entity0 pledge to ensure @entity0 sides continue to participate in the @entity70 and @entity34 tournaments			1
all they have to do is rustle up 120 - 150 players capable of competing at that level , four bona fide coaching line - ups , back - room staff , officials , sponsors , suppliers … oh , and crowds			0
all the indications are that the @entity0 public will view any such teams as unwelcome imposters and will greet them with hostility and indifference			1
meanwhile , the existing regions will be barred by the @entity0 from forming a break - away @entity0 league			1
all the top stars coming out of contract will join the exodus abroad and hordes of gifted players will be left in career limbo			0
the new sides will be routed week after week in front of empty stands and without local heroes to inspire them , the nation ’s gaze will be drawn even more emphatically to football , probably never to return			0
that is the reality of the @entity0 ’s fantasy vision			1
last week , this column lamented the steady erosion of club loyalty in the game , so how fitting that there should be an immediate antidote to such a doomsday perspective			0
while @entity113 are resigned to losing @entity114 to @entity115 , they confirmed on thursday that their veteran wing , @entity116 , has agreed a new contract to continue his 13 - year association with the @entity119			1
new deal : @entity121 ( right ) earned 10 caps for @entity123 from 2002 to 2008 ‘ @entity131 ’ has been one of the finest attacking players of the era at club level , even if an endless catalogue of injuries have cruelly undermined his @entity123 career			0
he is currently recovering from a fracture - dislocation of the left ankle and all those who revel in the sight of a free - spirit flier carving up defences will await his next comeback with great anticipation			0
tip - tackle rulings make no sense apologies for returning to a well - worn gripe , but officiating of tip - tackles has become a blight on the game and @entity148 ’ @entity149 against @entity150 provided fresh evidence of a lack of commonsense			1
first , @entity154 picked up @entity155 and dropped him on his back , but avoided a card despite conceding a penalty			0
later , @entity159 lifted @entity154 ’s legs above the level of his head , but then recognised the danger and lowered his legs down carefully , while the @entity148 centre used an arm to cushion his fall			1
sin - binned : @entity159 ( right ) had a right to feel aggrieved for his yellow card against @entity148 at @entity170 yet , the @entity150 wing received a yellow card for his actions , and he was n’t the only one to be stunned by the decision			1
there must be common sense applied , rather than a one - size - fits - all formula			1
legs being raised above a 90 - degree angle should n’t be an automatic trigger for disciplinary action , provided what follows is safe			0
a ball - carrier whose legs are lifted 95 degrees then lowered carefully is surely less at risk than one whose legs do n’t quite reach the horizontal , but is then dropped on to their spine			0
events on of @entity193 must surely have dismissed any lingering doubts about the wisdom of more so - called ‘ plastic ’ pitches being installed at club grounds – and at @entity57 arenas too			2
the @entity200 witnessed a tale of two surfaces amid a wet festive period , as @entity25 ’ game against the @entity26 went ahead , while @entity206 ’s clash with @entity207 was cancelled at short notice			2
the pitch at @entity210 could n’t cope with the monsoon , but that was n’t a problem in the @entity0 capital , now that the @entity215 has a state - of - the - art , @entity217 synthetic surface			1
making a splash : @entity222 duo @entity221 ( left ) and @entity223 slide in the flooded @entity225 pitch after their match against @entity207 was called off due to a waterlogged pitch water performance : the @entity25 v @entity26 clash went ahead on the artificial @entity215 surface it cost £ 400,000 to install but it is money well spent – with the @entity25 and the community already enjoying the benefits			1
the same can be said of @entity237 , who started the trend at their @entity241 ground			2
after several recent tests were disrupted by mud and torn turf , the artificial option should be embraced urgently			0
yet , there is a reluctance to go down the synthetic route at the @entity21 because officials there want to bring the @entity251 final to @entity252 and to do so ; they must provide a grass pitch			0
the last word ... the @entity255 are investigating @entity257 ’s comments after the @entity115 v sale match last saturday and the @entity115 ’ director of rugby faces the threat of a disrepute charge			2
he has also faced fierce criticism in some quarters , but not here			0
he accused @entity268 of setting out to ‘ cheat , cheat and cheat again ’ in the scrum and in response , his counterpart from the @entity266 club , @entity267 , insinuated that @entity115 break the salary cap			2
war of words : @entity115 chief @entity257 ( left ) and his sale counterpart @entity267 ( right ) despite that claim being denied by the @entity115 , @entity267 later repeated it			1
the match has generated a classic ‘ war of words ’ , which in turn generates tribal rivalry , passion and coverage , so where ’s the harm ? both @entity257 and @entity267 should have every right to speak their mind honestly			1
such sparring between coaches brings straight - talking colour to a game increasingly dominated by bland platitudes			0
every opposition is lethal , every defeat is a vital lesson with ‘ positives ’ , every controversy prompts treading on egg - shells			0
to hell with all that , let ’s have more shooting from the hip to enliven proceedings			0
even negative comments about referees should be permissible providing they are qualified , rather than just a scatter - gun attempt to deflect blame .			0
