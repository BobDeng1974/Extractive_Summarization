' i was concerned when what was happening from the @entity65 channel in our hotel in @entity17 but i did n't feel any tension there despite that			0
' we tried to find out what we could from the tour guides but they did n't seem too worried , they just kept saying that @entity3 and @entity77 people did n't want a war and that if there was one it would be manufactured by outside forces			0
@entity3 army officers punch the air as they chant slogans during a rally at @entity85 in downtown @entity17 @entity3 gather at a rally at @entity85 in downtown @entity17 , @entity3 @entity3 leader @entity33 pictured giving instructions while inspecting the @entity90 's landing exercise on the eastern coast on monday ' they seemed to say @entity3 would only go to war if it was provoked but when we asked what would provoke them they did n't say			1
' it seemed very relaxed and peaceful there , but you ca n't really tell what is going on or what people think because of all the propaganda and everything you see is stage - managed			0
' speaking before the group left @entity3 , mr @entity9 said : ' i contacted the @entity109 and if they say it 's unsafe we will not travel or organise further trips to @entity3			1
' however , there is a group of ten golfers in @entity17 , which is where the only public golf course is , who are due to fly out of the country tomorrow			0
' one of them is @entity2 and nine are @entity46			0
' i 'm in constant touch with them and they are all safe and in good spirits			0
' my customers know what they are getting into and they are travelling to hostile locations with the treat of war in the air			0
retaliation : a map appears to show potential targets of the rocket attacks			0
@entity33 's order followed a drill by two @entity8 stealth bombers over the @entity137 the previous day ' deterrence ' : a b - 2 stealth bomber ( right ) soars through the sky over a @entity8 air base in @entity142 , @entity77 , amid rising tension between the country and its neighbour to the @entity3 tensions : the drill involved the bomber striking a mock target , according to @entity77 news agency @entity150 ' i think a lot of it is @entity33 just showing the world his power and i 'm optimistic that there will be no nuclear war with the @entity8			1
' ' we had planned to organise a golfing tournament in may but with the current situation i do n't know if that will go ahead , some customers have already cancelled			0
' mr @entity9 , who has been to the state , said : ' we 've had warnings before but this is bit stronger than usual and seems a lot more serious this time ' it 's never been much of a concern before but it has been in the back of my mind			1
' in the early hours of this morning he received an email from the @entity3 warning him the outbreak of war could be ' hours away '			1
state news agency @entity176 said leader @entity33 had signed off on the order at a late - night meeting of top generals			2
@entity176 quoted him as saying the time to ' settle accounts ' with the @entity8 had arrived and the the @entity183 flights signalling an ' ultimatum '			2
the @entity3 has been unhappy about @entity186 sanctions and felt antagonised over @entity188 military drills			0
@entity189 and @entity190 for @entity17 , march 29 ( @entity176 ) the moves of the @entity8 imperialists to violate the sovereignty of the @entity3 and encroach upon its supreme interests have entered a grave phase			2
not content with letting @entity198 make sorties over south @entity3 in succession despite the repeated warnings , they made @entity183 stealth strategic bomber and other strategic strike means fly from @entity205 air force base in @entity206 , the @entity8 over south @entity3 on march 28 for the first time in history to commit such dangerous provocation as openly staging a drill for striking ground targets of the @entity3			2
this fully proves that the brigandish ambition of the @entity8 imperialists for aggression to stand in confrontation with the @entity3 has reached an extreme phase defying the meaningful warning made by its revolutionary armed forces in the march 26 statement of the @entity221 of the @entity90			2
in view of the prevailing grim situation , supreme commander of the @entity90 marshal @entity33 , first secretary of the @entity225 and first chairman of the @entity227 of the @entity3 , convened an urgent operation meeting on the @entity230 's performance of duty for firepower strike at the @entity221 at 00:30 friday			2
present there were @entity234 , chief of the @entity90 general staff , @entity237 , director of the @entity238 , @entity239 , director of the general @entity240 , and @entity242 , commander of the @entity230			0
at the meeting he first received a report from general @entity239 , who is also vice chief of the general staff of the @entity90 , on the information about the nature of action of the nuclear strike means of the @entity8 imperialist aggressor forces			1
after receiving a report from @entity251			0
general @entity242 on the technical conditions of the strategic strike means of the @entity90 , he made an important decision			0
he said he has judged the time has come to settle accounts with the @entity8 imperialists in view of the prevailing situation			2
if they make a reckless provocation with huge strategic forces , the @entity90 should mercilessly strike the @entity8 mainland , their stronghold , their military bases in the operational theaters in the @entity262 , including @entity263 and @entity264 , and those in south @entity3 , he said			1
he examined and finally ratified the plan of the @entity230 for firepower strike			0
the @entity8 imperialists let @entity183 make sorties over south @entity3 in succession , indicating once again that their hostile acts against the @entity3 have entered a reckless phase , going beyond the phase of threat and blackmail , he said			2
@entity183 's flight to the sky above @entity77 is not a simple demonstration of forces in reaction to the tough stand of the @entity3 but an ultimatum that they will ignite a nuclear war at any cost on the @entity137 , he noted , underlining the need to put a definite end to the times when they could threaten and blackmail the @entity3 with nukes			2
he declared the revolutionary armed forces of the @entity3 would react to the @entity8 nuclear blackmail with a merciless nuclear attack , and war of aggression with an all - out war of justice			1
he finally signed the plan on technical preparations of strategic rockets of the @entity90 , ordering them to be standby for fire so that they may strike any time the @entity8 mainland , its military bases in the operational theaters in the @entity262 , including @entity263 and @entity264 , and those in @entity77			1
he said the enemies are bringing dark clouds of a nuclear war testing the @entity3 's self - restraint , adding the @entity3 can no longer tolerate this			0
he ordered the @entity90 to blow up and reduce everything to ashes at a single strike , if an order is issued			0
he said the heroic service personnel of the @entity90 and all other people , their hearts burning with irrepressible resentment at the reckless war provocation moves of the @entity8 imperialists , are now waiting for a final order of the @entity326 , hardening their will to turn out in a do - or - die battle with the enemies			1
the @entity90 will never remain a passive onlooker to the @entity8 imperialists ' frantic moves for aggression but do its best to defend the destiny of the country and nation , he said			0
it is the truth confirmed by history that no force on earth can hold in check the people all out for the just cause , he noted , stressing if an undesired war breaks out on this land again due to the consequences of the unpardonable action of the @entity8 imperialists , it will bring them a shameful ruin and the @entity3 nation will greet the bright day of national reunification			1
the important decision made by him under the grave situation where the @entity137 has been pushed to the brink of a nuclear war by the @entity8 imperialists will mark a turning point in putting an end to the history of the long - standing showdown with the @entity8 and opening a new phase of history .			1
