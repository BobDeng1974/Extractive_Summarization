brave : @entity1 , 14 , publicly condemned the @entity3 's brutal atrocities and campaigned like mad for girls ' education			1
she is now fighting for her life after being shot in the neck and head at close range @entity1 is 14 years old			1
in the past three years , she has become @entity11 ’s most famous schoolgirl , the winner of numerous peace prizes and a national award for bravery , as well as an international symbol of resistance against the @entity3			1
because as they tortured and slaughtered their way through her home town of @entity21 in the @entity22 of north - west @entity11 , @entity1 dared to do what so few others did			1
she publicly condemned the @entity3 ’s brutal atrocities and campaigned like mad for girls ’ education — first in an anonymous blog and later , when her cover was blown , in newspaper interviews and on national and international television			1
today , she is fighting for her life after being shot in the neck and head at close range while she sat with classmates on a bus in the school grounds in @entity21 , waiting for a lift home after morning classes			1
witnesses said a bearded man asked for @entity1 by name before opening fire			1
another girl on the bus was also wounded			2
the @entity44 ( @entity44 ) accepted responsibility and promised that if @entity1 survives their bullets , they will target her again			1
@entity1 , meanwhile , was whisked away by military helicopter , first to an intensive care ward in @entity49 — where doctors operated for three hours to remove the bullet and reduce the dangerous swelling in her head			1
yesterday , as she recuperated and the international community was united in revulsion at the @entity3 ’s latest atrocity , speculation was mounting that @entity1 ’s next destination will be @entity59			1
@entity1 was just 11 when she started writing a blog for the @entity62 service in january 2009			1
two years earlier , the @entity3 had begun infiltrating the beautiful @entity22 — known as the @entity63 of @entity11 and popular with honeymooners — and by 2009 they ’d assumed almost total control of the previously peaceful valley , imposing @entity68 law with monstrous force			1
all women had to wear the burka and were banned from shopping and going to market			2
more than 400 schools were closed overnight			2
dissenters were flogged in the streets			2
discipline was ruthless and brutal			2
men and women deemed un-islamic were slaughtered and their decapitated bodies left hanging in the squares of @entity21 as warnings			2
@entity3 gunmen in @entity11 took responsibility for the shooting but @entity1 , a shy and obedient girl with dimples and huge , dark eyes — and encouraged by her father @entity95 , a school owner , poet and fellow educational activist — was n’t afraid to speak out			1
‘ i was scared enough to see the pictures of bodies hanging in @entity22 , ’ she said in an interview earlier this year			2
‘ but the decision to ban girls from going to school was choking me and i decided to stand against the force of backwardness			2
’ so she started blogging — under the pseudonym @entity1 , which means cornflower in her local @entity111 language and which she much prefers to her own name , which translates as ‘ grief stricken ’			1
@entity1 said the blog was ‘ like a mirror ’ that described everything that happened to her and her friends during the occupation — how they were forced to hide books under their shawls and lived in fear of having acid thrown in their faces			1
how the @entity3 flogged women in public and killed dissenters			1
she wrote of the terrible dreams she had of military helicopters and the @entity3 , and of her scarily shrinking class , as friends were too terrified to turn up at school			1
wounded : hospital staff assist @entity1 as she arrives at @entity133 after the attack in the @entity22 region in northwest @entity11 help : crowds gathered around the hospital as news quickly spread about the attempted assassination of the young peace activist ‘ my mother made me breakfast and i went off to school , ’ she wrote on january 3 , 2009			1
‘ i was afraid going to school because the @entity3 had issued an edict banning all girls from attending schools			1
only 11 students attended the class out of 27			2
‘ on my way home i heard a man saying : ‘ i will kill you			2
’ i hastened my pace and after a while i looked back			2
but to my utter relief he was on his mobile and must have been threatening someone else			0
’ the following day , she continued : ‘ today is a holiday and i woke up later , around 10am			0
i heard my father talking about another three bodies lying at @entity164 ( crossing )			0
i felt bad on hearing this			0
we all used to go to @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 for picnics on sundays			0
but we have n’t been out on a picnic for over a year and a half			0
’ every day produced a new , humbling entry			0
friday , january 9 : ‘ i switched on the tv in the evening and heard about the blasts in @entity176			0
i said to myself : “ why do these blasts keep happening in @entity11 ? ” ’ support : hundreds of people gathered outside the hospital willing to give blood to save @entity1 wednesday , january 14 : ‘ i may not go to school again			1
since today was the last day of our school , we decided to play in the playground a bit longer			0
i am of the view that the school will one day reopen but while leaving i looked up at the building as if i would not come here again			0
’ the next day her school had been closed down and she wrote : ‘ the night was filled with the noise of artillery fire and i woke up three times			0
but since there was no school i got up later at 10am			0
afterwards , my friend came over and we discussed our homework			0
’ the simplicity and the honesty of her writing propelled her on to the international stage : ‘ some people are afraid of ghosts , some people are afraid of spiders			0
in @entity22 we are afraid of humans			0
but not humans like us — these were barbarians			0
’ her father — who received death threats himself — was aware of the dangers she faced			0
‘ it was a risk , but not talking was a greater risk than that , ’ he said			0
‘ a couple of times , letters were thrown in our house warning that @entity1 should stop doing what she is doing or the outcome will be very bad			1
‘ but @entity1 was never fearful			1
she would frequently say : “ i am satisfied			0
i am doing good work for my people so nobody can do anything to me			0
” ’ attacked : @entity1 was shot on her way home from school @entity1 continued writing and campaigning even when her friends recognised her from the diaries and her cover was blown			1
‘ i kept going because it was the only mission i had , ’ she said			0
‘ it was risky , but we wanted to go to school and it was our mission			0
we thought the @entity3 did not have access to the internet and they were backward and they came from the mountains			1
’ she did n’t even stop when @entity11 troops arrived to launch an attack against the militants and she and her young brothers had to flee their beloved city , not knowing if they would return			0
or if there would be anything to return to			0
for months , the war displaced and separated her family			0
it was agony for @entity1			1
‘ leaving our home was like growing apart from our heart , ’ she said			0
‘ our home is our heart			0
it was a very difficult and bad time			0
’ once the @entity3 had been driven from the lush plains of the @entity22 and the family returned , the first thing @entity1 did was to check that her school books and notes were intact			1
her campaigning gathered more momentum and she became bolder and bolder			0
she pleaded with president @entity264 ’s special representative to @entity265 and @entity11 , @entity263 , to intervene			0
she hosted foreign diplomats in @entity22 , held news conferences on peace and education and won a host of peace awards , national and international , and @entity11 ’s highest civilian prize			2
she even started work on the @entity274 — to ensure all poor girls in @entity22 could go to school — and planned her future as a politician			2
‘ i will carry on my work for the girls and i will speak out for their rights , ’ she said			2
most importantly , she went back to school , where classmates called her ‘ the life of the class ’			2
outrage : activists carry photographs of @entity1 during a protest rally against her assassination attempt in @entity176 @entity291 : women hold banners demanding education rights during a protest in @entity296 with all she ’s achieved so far in her desperately short life , it is easy to forget that , as well as being a ‘ steady , calming force ’ , @entity1 is a teenager who likes shopping and jewellery and giggling with her friends and , given half the chance , watching trashy @entity306 sitcoms on television			1
let ’s hope she gets to do all of those things once again			0
yesterday , her father — who turned down offers of protection from security forces because he believed that not even the @entity3 would stoop so low as to target a school girl — was insisting the shooting would stop neither him nor his daughter from their work			1
he ca n’t allow the @entity3 to think for a moment that it has won			1
but as a @entity59 visa was obtained for @entity1 and surgeons in the @entity59 were fully briefed about her condition , there was every indication she and her family could be planning to come here for medical help and refuge			2
and with @entity3 death threats hanging over her , @entity1 will not be able to return to her beloved @entity22 , and perhaps even @entity11 , for a long time to come			1
in a recent interview , her desperately proud father said of @entity1 : ‘ she is very committed to life			1
’ let ’s just hope that after all she ’s been through , she has the strength to build herself a new one .			0
