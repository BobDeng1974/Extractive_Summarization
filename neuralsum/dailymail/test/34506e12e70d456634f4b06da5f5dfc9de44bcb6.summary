@entity0 would be a ' catastrophe ' for @entity2 , according to @entity4 bosses seven out of 10 business chiefs at @entity2 's biggest companies think @entity0 would be a ' catastrophe ' for @entity2 , a survey has revealed			1
the poll of @entity4 chairman has revealed overwhelming support for @entity12 to remain prime minister , despite the widespread business concern over his pledge to hold an in - out referendum on @entity17			1
it comes just days after more than 100 company bosses signed a letter warning against a @entity22 government			1
it also echoes controversial remarks by the @entity26 chief executive @entity25 who sparked fury after claiming it would be a ' catastrophe ' for the @entity2 if @entity22 won the election			0
the poll of 35 business chairman , by the headhunters @entity33 , is a further blow to @entity22 which is struggling to repair its relationship with big business after a series of controversial policy announcements			2
mr @entity0 last week vowed to ban 90 per cent of zero - hours contracts and unveiled proposals to make it easier for workers to take their bosses to court for unfair dismissal			1
he also confirmed plans to raise corporation tax for the first time in 40 years to raise cash for a Â£ 400 cut in business rates for smaller firms			2
one of the @entity4 bosses surveyed , who did not want to be named , said businesses could work with @entity22 's shadow business secretary @entity53 and its economics chief @entity54			1
but he said mr @entity0 's ' tone and rhetoric ' had proved ' deeply disturbing ' , adding : ' at times his language is vitriolic and he appears to completely misunderstand business			1
' mr @entity53 , speaking on @entity59 today , @entity53 insisted @entity22 was no anti-business and defended mr @entity0 's recent announcemtn that @entity22 would all - but outlaw zero - hours contracts			1
mr @entity53 admitted not all zero - hours contracts were ' awful and bad ' , but insisted many workers were being exploited			2
mr @entity53 said : ' i think this will be massively helpful			0
there are 1.8million zero hours contracts now and i think this will transform people 's lives			0
' the shadow business secretary has also pointed to @entity22 's refusal to offer a @entity17 referendum as a policy which business supported			0
@entity12 and @entity79 , out campaigning today , have jumped on business criticism of the @entity22 to boost their core campaign message that only the @entity83 can be trusted with the economy he said : ' business people have been very impressed that @entity0 took a decision on a matter of principle on the in - out referendum			1
it would have been easier to dance to @entity92 's tune , as the @entity93 have done			0
' last week , mr @entity53 and a host of other @entity22 figures hit out at @entity2 's top business leaders after they backed the @entity93 ' economic plan and urged voters not to risk a ' change of course '			2
in a highly unusual intervention just weeks from the general election , the business chiefs claimed a @entity22 government would ' put the recovery at risk '			1
mr @entity0 said the letter was not a surprise and only showed that the @entity83 were on the side of ' a few big firms and individuals at the top '			1
mr @entity53 , meanwhile , dismissed the signatories as a ' cosy little club ' , while @entity22 peer @entity115 went further criticising them as ' tax dodgers , @entity93 voters and non-doms '			0
mr @entity12 , however , insisted the intervention was ' unprecedented ' and claimed it sent a ' very powerful message '			0
the business chiefs who signed the letter run companies with well known retail brands such as @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130			1
bosses behind big name retailers , drinks and restaurants have backed the @entity93 economic plan , including ( top row ) @entity127 and @entity130 and ( bottom row ) @entity129 , @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity128 executives at consumer brands such as @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 are also on the list			2
embarrassingly for @entity22 , the list of business chiefs includes several who supported the governments of @entity153 and @entity154			2
however , mr @entity0 said the letter only served to expose the choice at the election			1
he said : ' businesses have come out today to say they want lower business taxes and , you know , that does n't surprise me			0
' but it does also go to the wider choice at this election			0
the conservatives really believe that if all of the few corporations and individuals at the top are doing well , the wealth will magically trickle down for everybody else			0
' we have tried that experiment over the last few years and it has n't worked			0
we have seen falling living standards and falling wages and insecurity at work			0
i just have a different view about the way the country succeeds			0

seven out of 10 said @entity0 fearful of a @entity188
comes after 100 business chiefs signed an open letter in support of @entity83
mr @entity0 said letter only showed @entity195 backed his rich friends in the @entity197
