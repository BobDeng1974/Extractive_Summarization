with their loud shouts of ‘ oh no it is n’t ! ’ , pantomimes have always had a proud tradition of audience participation			0
but one amateur production suffered more than its fair share of boos and hisses – when a rival group turned up to heckle the performance			2
their jeers were so distracting it caused cast members to stumble over their lines and terrified a number of children on stage , leading organisers to brand it ‘ sabotage ’			1
members of the @entity21 ( pictured during the dress rehearsal for their performance of @entity24 ) were said to have stumbled over their lines and been ' left terrified ' by the jeers from their rivals @entity21 ( @entity21 ) had performed a successful run of @entity24 and was looking forward to a triumphant last night			1
but members claimed their final performance was ruined when several people of the rival @entity32 ( @entity32 ) turned up at the show in @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36			1
organisers last night said the unwelcome guests were once part of cats but left because they did not get the parts they wanted			0
one anonymous audience member said the evening was ‘ ruined ’ by the uninvited interruption , adding : ‘ now , there is crowd participation , which every pantomime should strive to encourage , but this was clearly interference and sabotage			2
‘ a number of the @entity21 cast were singled out for special treatment and the hecklers became louder and louder until these cast members became visibly nervous and began to make mistakes			1
' at this point the feeling of victory from the hecklers was palpable as they jeered and laughed out loud , and a number of children in the cast left the stage terrified after performing			1
’ @entity21 leader @entity64 said there would be no tit - for - tat retaliation			2
she said : ‘ every panto wants booing and hissing and that sort of stuff but this was over the top			0
cast members from @entity32 ( pictured ) admitted heckling the performance at the @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36 , but said it was ' just a little bit of banter ' and said the group ' took offence ' the incident occurred during @entity21 's final performance of @entity24 ( above ) , subject of a hit 1992 @entity85 film ‘ a few of them used to be part of our cast and did n’t get the parts they wanted , and they have got quite nasty about it			1
‘ i felt very sorry for the cast and members of the audience because people have said to me that it ruined their night			2
’ @entity32 insisted it was just ‘ a bit of banter ’			1
secretary @entity103 added : ‘ it was n’t anything different to what others might do at a performance where people know one another			0
‘ some of our members gave a little bit of banter and they took offence			0
' we go to many local pantos , not just @entity35 , and it is all just part and parcel of it			0
it ’s part of the banter between groups			0
‘ maybe we might have been a fraction too loud but we are expecting them to retaliate at our performance			0
