all creatures great and small had their beach bodies put to the test as keepers put them on the scales for @entity5 's annual weigh - in			2
camels , tigers , waxy monkey frogs , giant @entity10 land snails and tamandua tree anteaters were among the creatures which had their vital statistics recorded			1
the measurements are used to monitor the animals ' health and shared with zoos across the world to compare information on endangered species			1
the height and mass of every animal in the zoo , of which there are over 16,000 , needs to be recorded @entity24 @entity40 , who looks after camels , said : ' every year we like to weigh the animals we have at the zoo , really just for a record so we can share it with other zoos and even conservation projects abroad ' a 40g @entity49			1
the measurements of each creature are collated in the @entity52 , from which zoologists can use the data to compare information on thousands of endangered species @entity24 @entity40 , who looks after camels , said : ' every year we like to weigh the animals we have at the zoo , really just for a record so we can share it with other zoos and even conservation projects abroad			1
' not everything can be weighed , but anything that we have that can be trained , from camels to birds , aadvarks to armadillos - even the tigers - we are trying to get weighed today			1
' by being able to tell what they weigh , we can use that later on if they 're not very well - if they 've lost weight we know that they 're sick , if they 're pregnant their weights will go up , so throughout the year we can use it as a comparative			2
information taken from some of @entity5 's more than 19,000 animals is shared on the @entity52 ( @entity83 ) , a database for zoologists all over the globe			1
a 500g @entity88 is weighed on a lettuce leaf			2
by being able to tell what they weigh , zookeepers can use the information later on if they 're not very well @entity93 , the @entity94 , enjoys a mealworm breakfast as she sits on a set of electronic scales and is weighed , during the annual stock take of weights and sizes a @entity101 on a set of scales			1
throughout the year the measurement can be used as a comparative but actually getting the measurements on record can prove tricky , especially when it comes to animals such as tigers or camels			1
zookeeper @entity24 was charged with tempting @entity26 tiger @entity25 to stand up against a measuring tape			0
mr @entity24 used horse meat to get the five - and - a - half - year - old male to spread out , and after a few goes was able to measure him at a length of about 6ft 6in ( 2m )			0
asked which animals were the hardest to measure and weigh , he said : ' it 's down to individuals really			2
' @entity119 , the female , is very difficult because she is quite a nervy animal , very tigress - y and will keep away from you			0
' that particular individual is quite difficult to get on to the weighing scales - although we have achieved that we have n't been able to measure her length			0
' @entity25 is completely different - we can do practically anything we want with him			0
workers at the park said actually getting the measurements on record can prove tricky the @entity33 sniffs the scales as keepers look on and laugh			2
they say taking the measurements can be especially difficult when it comes to animals such as tigers or camels an @entity140			1
the measurements are used to monitor the animals ' health and shared with zoos across the world to compare information on endangered species ' really , species to species does n't matter , it 's the individual to individual that 's important			1
' keepers found that female two - humped camel @entity154 had lost weight since last year , despite coming in at a whopping 625kg ( 98 stone )			0
originally from the @entity160 desert , which runs from northern @entity161 to southern @entity162 , the bactrian camels were trained for a month to get ready for today 's weigh - in			0
' the first time we put the scales in there , it was very scary for him apparently , so he ran to the other side of the paddock and would n't come anywhere near us , ' ms @entity40 said			0
' it 's taken about a month but we 've done it using positive reinforcement , just getting him closer and closer			0
' we got to two feet on the scales after about two weeks and the other two feet took the rest of the two weeks			0
' it was quite challenging but quite fun for the keepers because we have now been able to get the weight , it 's quite an achievement			0

@entity184 monkey frogs , giant @entity10 land snails and tamandua tree anteaters were among those being weighed
