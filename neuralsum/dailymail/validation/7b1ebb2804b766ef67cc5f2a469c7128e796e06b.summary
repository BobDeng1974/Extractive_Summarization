@entity0 and @entity2 's imposing frames may not have delivered for @entity3 this @entity4 but they made the day of some young stars of the future on wednesday			1
@entity3 have just one win from their three this tournament but will be looking to turn that around in @entity10 when they take on @entity12 , one of the two team 's behind them on the table			1
before they got down to business on wednesday with their preparations ahead of their clash with @entity12 , @entity0 , @entity21 showed their squad remains in good spirits with a pre-training session with local children in @entity27			1
kids pile onto powerful @entity3 centre @entity0 during a training session in @entity27 @entity0 play acts as the young stars of the future attempt to bring him down during a pre-training session @entity3 's no 8 @entity36 joins the ruck as @entity3 have some fun before getting down to business @entity3 captain @entity2 is all smiles as he towers over these youngsters flanker @entity2 , finding some space among the children , will be hoping his side bounce back in @entity12 @entity3 enjoyed a jovial run with young players at their training base just south of @entity48 , which included kids struggling to bring down massive centre @entity0 and @entity2 appearing to enjoy his customary role of towering over all even more than usual			1
once the fun was over though @entity53 was laying down the law as they prepared for their visit to @entity10 on sunday where they 'll be keen to add to their solitary win of the tournament			1
@entity3 , who are fourth behind @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 , have been far from convincing so far this campaign , accounting only for @entity67 15 - 8 in their opening match			1
with losses back to back against @entity63 and @entity64 - both by just seven points - they 'll be eager to give fans a glimpse of the potential their coach is convinced they have at their disposal			2
@entity3 's prop @entity77 spins a pass to his left during a jovial training run on wednesday @entity2 smiles as the youngsters line up to shake his hand after their light - hearted run closer to their size was @entity3 scrum half @entity86 , who was recalled for the @entity64 loss they will be expected to come away from @entity90 with maximum points , but their last two trips to @entity10 have ended in disappointment for @entity3			1
after venting following the @entity64 defeat , @entity53 put his support behind his players this week , saying he had ' faith ' in them to turn things around in @entity12			1
' the team has a lot of potential , ' he said			2
' over the last two and half years we 've learned a lot			2
i have a group of professionals , and a good team , but they need to maximise their potential			2
' saturday ( against @entity64 ) , we were only at 70 - 80 per cent			0
as a coach , but also as a lover of rugby , i expect a lot more from this team			0
i have faith in this squad			0
' they have the right values , and they are doing well as a squad			0
they need to do more on the pitch , as a team and individually			0
they need to take the initiative			0
' but honestly , if we did n't believe in them , we 'd have changed lots of players			0
on sunday in @entity12 i expect a reaction because we have a squad with values and they will show it on sunday			1
' do n't go above the horizontal ! @entity3 's lock @entity136 tackles a young players without the ball down to business , prop @entity77 charges forward as training gets serious south of @entity48 @entity142 ( left ) and @entity3 head coach @entity53 speak on the training pitch in @entity27 @entity3 show a united front as they gather ahead of their trip to @entity10 to take on @entity12 they 'll be doing it without winger @entity149 , who 's been ruled out with a hamstring injury picked up for @entity151 in their defeat by @entity154 at the weekend			1
it 's a blow to @entity149 who got his first start in this @entity4 against @entity64			2
he 'll be replaced by @entity160 's @entity159			0
' disappointed to leave the team but a bit bothered by my hamstring which prevents me from being 100 %			0
supporting the team with all my heart , ' @entity149 said on @entity167 .			0
