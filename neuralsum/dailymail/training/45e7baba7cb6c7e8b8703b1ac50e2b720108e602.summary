the @entity16 fast food market is already worth £ 7bn , and this is expected to double by 2016			1
@entity19 documentary filmmaker @entity18 travelled to @entity20 to investigate , meeting some of @entity0 's most overweight teenagers , including @entity22 , 13 , who already weighs 15st and is having a gastric band fitted to prevent him overeating further			2
' and they tend to be referred to as " healthy " , meaning not underfed			0
' medical professionals appear on @entity18 's documentary demanding the government takes a stand when it comes to selling fast food			1
regulation of the fast food industry is much looser in @entity0 than in @entity5 countries , and wealthy @entity0 are susceptible to the lure of plentiful advertising and the promise of a @entity5 lifestyle			2
as a result , the obesity crisis is swelling in every @entity16 city , and the epidemic is causing health problems further down the line			2
@entity0 are already more genetically predisposed to diabetes than most of the world , and with 50m sufferers the country boasts the largest diabetic population on the planet			1

and traditional street food vendors , where earlier generations fed themselves on healthier vegetarian curries and rice , are adapting ; some roadside carts now sell nothing but hot dogs and burgers			0
@entity0 are increasingly turning towards @entity5 junk food in effort to emulate affluent lifestyles , while simultaneously cutting back on physical activity young people consider these roadside food options less ' trendy ' than a pre-packaged @entity12 's burger , and complain that they eat typical @entity16 cuisine at home , so when they go out with their friends they want to eat chips and hot dogs			1
