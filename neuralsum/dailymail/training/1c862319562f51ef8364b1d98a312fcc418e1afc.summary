when @entity0 heard her favourite play area could be built over for a housing estate she was determined to stop it happening			1
despite being only nine , the schoolgirl went to a public meeting with other ‘ @entity7 ’ campaigners – and was so impressive she was chosen to make the key final speech to councillors			2
not only did @entity0 write the speech herself , but she moved the planning committee chairman to tears with her emotional and word perfect address			1
moving words : @entity0 , of @entity17 , helped fight off developers hoping to concrete over her favourite play area by reducing the planning boss to tears in a two - minute speech thanks in no little part to her efforts , @entity23 unanimously rejected the application to build 21 houses on the plot of land in the village of @entity32 , @entity33			1
@entity0 , who lives a few yards from the green , said she was ‘ really upset ’ about the proposed scheme because the play area ‘ means so much to me ’			2
she was determined to do her bit , writing a letter of objection and then bravely speaking in front of around 100 people at the town hall			0
jumping for joy : the bright young girl , pictured on @entity46 , in the village of @entity32 , wrote the speech without any help from her parents she said : ‘ i think my speech made the difference because i saw the chairman crying			2
i think more children should speak about important issues			0
‘ i enjoyed speaking to these people and i would like to be a councillor when i grow up			0
‘ i was a bit nervous but i tried to speak loudly and clearly so everyone could hear me			0
’ her father @entity59 , 41 , a steelworks manager , said @entity0 and his son @entity60 , 13 , played regularly on the green with their friends			1
‘ it is safe , it ’s away from the road and there are benches so parents can keep an eye on younger children , ’ he said			0
reduced to tears : @entity74 chairman councillor @entity73 , above , who has two daughters himself , cried after watching @entity76 deliver a speech in her bid to save the green ‘ when @entity0 found out someone wanted to build houses there she said that would n’t be fair on the children and she decided to do her bit			1
‘ she wrote her own speech – her mum and i did n’t help her at all			0
it was a good effort by the campaigners but someone said afterwards that @entity0 ’s speech was the cherry on the top			2
‘ i think it ’s amazing that she had the confidence to stand up in front of all those people			0
’ popular play area : the green in the middle of the @entity46 in @entity17 will no longer be concreted over planning chairman councillor @entity73 , who has two young daughters himself , said later : ‘ i do n’t mind admitting that i shed a few tears after @entity0 spoke			1
‘ i am a bit of a big softie but it ’s the first time i have ever been in tears at a planning meeting			1
’ councillors received 49 letters of objection and a petition signed by more than 850 people			0
the green was owned by the @entity113 before being acquired by developers			0
victory for residents : following the hearing the planning board made a unanimous decision to scrap the development plans , outlined in the sketch above			1
