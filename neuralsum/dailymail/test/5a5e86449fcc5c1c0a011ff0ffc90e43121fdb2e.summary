the former graphic designer , who is now the girls ' full - time carer , said : ' there 's no cure for what they have and there 's not much the doctors can say , so we just try and keep them comfortable while they 're with us			1
' they 'll eventually lose their sight and hearing and , when that time comes , we want to be able to provide them with somewhere where they can still have fun			2
' the condition causes premature ageing , so despite the fact the girls are seven years apart , they look like they are a similar age			0
@entity12 currently has a tremor , which makes drinking from a beaker difficult , and she only says words like ' yes ' and ' juice '			1

' i was pregnant with @entity13 at the time and that 's when we found out she would be born with the same disease			1
' it was devastating , but once we got over the shock we decided we would do all that we could to make their lives memorable			0
' the disease is inherited and mrs @entity5 and her husband , a hgv driver , both carry the mutated gene			1
they have a one - in - four chance of conceiving a child with @entity15 , whereas the odds are usually two in a million			2
