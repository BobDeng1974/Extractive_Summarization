if @entity5 's @entity4 side do race away with this season 's @entity7 title , the acquisitions of @entity1 and @entity2 will no doubt be looked upon as the main components to a successful campaign			1
such flair and creativity from the @entity4 attack , however , would not be able to flourish without the solid blue wall that consists of @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			1
this season has seen a more expansive @entity4 than fans are used to under @entity5 with the likes of @entity22 and @entity2 supplying the ammo for £ 32million man @entity1 , who already has nine @entity7 goals to his name			1
@entity17 has played every minute of @entity4 's @entity7 campaign so far @entity18 ( left ) and @entity15 provide a solid platform for @entity4 to attack although @entity29 sit top of the fewest goals conceded charts , letting in just five so far , @entity4 's back line is one that breeds confidence and looks ready for any kind of battle they may face together			1
@entity4 's back four would have played in every minute of @entity4 's 10 @entity7 games so far this season had in not been for @entity18 's three - game ban following his red card against @entity42 last month and it 's no coincidence that this consistency is giving the team a superb platform to build from			1
the difference between the league leaders and their rivals this season is the fact that they have four warriors at the back			2
@entity57 can always rely on captain @entity58 , @entity56 fans will tell you per @entity60 is the man , while @entity62 are calling out for a defender of @entity17 's caliber following the departure of @entity66			0
@entity17 has 75 per cent of his tackled during his 900 minutes of @entity7 football in his 2014 - 15 defence , @entity5 has a four - piece that have been playing together for the best part of two years and their qualities lend themselves perfectly to the @entity75 manager 's desire to see his team defend properly			1
it 's no surprise that @entity5 was quick to get rid of flamboyant defender @entity78 last summer , he was always going to be too unpredictable to nail down a starting place in the @entity7			0
@entity80 , a huge part of @entity84 's impressive defence last season , ca n't get a look in despite costing the club £ 16m and despite @entity18 not actually being left - footed			2
@entity88 pundit @entity87 recently claimed @entity18 is as ' near to perfect as possible when it comes to defending			0
' he was right - a quick glance at the @entity92 's stats so far this season show that @entity18 has won 91.7 per cent of his tackles while making 17 interceptions in his eight appearances for the @entity98 club			2
when asked who he though was the best defender is the @entity7 , @entity87 said : ' i ’d say , for consistency of performances , it would be one of the @entity4 lads – and i ’d probably say @entity18			1
@entity106 acts as the spoiler in @entity4 's well - drilled midfield unit to have impressed so much ' for technical defending , not making a mistake , not being in the wrong position , not getting caught out … i do n’t see him making a mistake			2
' on the opposing flank , @entity4 have a monster of a defender in @entity15 who rarely gets beaten in a show of strength or even speed			0
after a pre-season without @entity123 football , the @entity120 captain hit the ground running and nailed down his right back position just when it looked as though he 'd be the man to drop out of @entity5 's starting xi this term			0
the centre back pairing of @entity16 and @entity17 continues to be the best defensive partnership in the domestic league by some distance			1
although @entity16 can at times look slightly out of sorts without @entity17 at his side , the @entity134 vice-captain has improved ten-fold since his move from @entity139 in 2012			2
at the tender age of 33 , @entity17 still seems to bring the best out of the players around him while still performing at a level most @entity7 centre halves can only admire			0
the @entity4 skipper continues to flourish in the absence of international football and his experience will be vital to the west @entity151 club 's title push			0
@entity5 has seen his side concede late goals at the @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 this season the @entity158 defence may be impressive , but @entity5 will still be frustrated with the fact that his side have kept just three clean sheets so far this season - there is room for improvement			0
the 50 - year - old boss has seen his side concede late goals at the @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 this season which is something @entity5 will be looking to cut out			0
despite that fact , @entity5 can take confidence from watching his rivals struggle to field the same back four each weekend			0
@entity62 's defence has lost the likes @entity66 and @entity172 while being plagued with injuries , @entity169 seems to have a desire to rotate his @entity57 full backs and is having to allow @entity176 time to adapt while title contenders @entity178 and @entity56 struggle to keep pace after a poor summer transfer window			0
@entity18 ( right ) and @entity17 make up half of @entity4 's first choice back four here , @entity183 compare the defences of this season 's title contenders to find out which back line comes out on top			1
@entity18 - 8/10 @entity16 - 8/10 @entity17 - 9/10 @entity15 - 8/10 final score : 33/40 @entity190 - 6.5/10 @entity58 - 9/10 @entity176 - 7/10 @entity191 - 7/10 final score : 29.5/40 @entity192 - 7/10 @entity193 - 7/10 per mertesacker - 6.5/10 @entity194 - 6/10 final score : 26.5 @entity195 - 6/10 @entity196 - 6.5/10 @entity197 - 7/10 @entity198 - 6/10 final score : 25.5 @entity58 ( right ) with his hands on his head dejected after the defeat against @entity202			1

@entity4 's back four will be key to @entity7 success this season
@entity2 and @entity1 have provided more attacking flair
@entity16 and @entity17 are best defensive partnership in the league
@entity18 has thrived in @entity4 's back line
title rivals have struggled to field same back four each week
