@entity12 , 19 , won a claim to $ 25 million dollars , an increase from the $ 3 million trust fund originally left to her when her iron ore magnate father @entity17 died in 2012			1
ms @entity12 claimed that the amount left to her from her father 's estimated worth of $ 1 billion was insufficient and would not be able to provide her with advancement in life , reported @entity22			1
@entity12 , 19 , won a claim to $ 25 million dollars , an increase from the $ 3 million trust left to her by mining magnate @entity17 the 19 - year - old told the @entity28 that she needed a home five times the @entity31 median price ( $ 2.5 million ) , $ 10,000 each year for fashion accessories including @entity34 sunglasses and $ 100,000 for a wedding when she ties the knot			1

on thursday , master @entity59 of the @entity28 agreed , saying mr @entity17 did not make adequate provision for his youngest child from his ' colossal ' estate			1
' the deceased had a vast fortune and he was in the fortunate position of being able to provide for all of the parties who had a claim on his bounty , ' @entity63 said			0
while the 19 - year - old had been included in the trust , the structure meant that ms @entity12 might have received very little as the will stated that she could receive ' up to ' $ 3 million			1
the judge also found that the will had been worded in an ' unwieldy ' way , and that her fate was in the hands of the executor of the will , @entity82 , whom ms @entity12 had never met , and whom had close ties with other family members			2
@entity63 found the situation ' unreasonable ' , and said that the will ' could operate in an entirely oppressive fashion ' , potentially excluding her as a beneficiary if she was convicted of a drink driving offence			0
@entity12 , 19 , claimed that a $ 3 million trust fund left to her when her iron ore magnate father @entity17 ( pictured ) died in 2012 is inadequate ms @entity12 , pictured outside the @entity3 @entity28 on thursday , won $ 25 million of the estate ms @entity12 was suing her two half - sisters who had already been awarded $ 400 million of their father 's estate ' it may even be the case if she was suspected of involvement with someone who used an illicit substance she could be excluded , ' he said			1
one of the clauses of the will stated that if the plaintiff converted to @entity105 , or perhaps @entity106 - or even was associated with someone who practised those faiths - she would be an ' excluded person '			0
@entity63 found the clause ' an extraordinary proposition ' and that she would have to give up her @entity112 birthright of freedom of religion			2
@entity63 said the $ 25 million should be paid to ms @entity12 in a lump sum			1
the rest of the estate will pass to ms @entity12 's half - sisters , @entity118 and @entity119 , who will get about $ 10 million each minus about $ 1 million for legal costs			0
ms @entity12 is now suing her father 's other two children - @entity118 and 足 @entity119 - and the executor of her father 's will , @entity82			0
the matter was heard in the @entity28 on monday ' that is on top of the $ 400 million they already have and they can rest easy in the knowledge their half - sister will be financially secure for the rest of her life , ' he said			2
mr @entity17 was estimated to be worth $ 1.5 billion when he died at 74 and was the son of @entity138 , who co-founded @entity139 and @entity140 with @entity143 - @entity142 's father			1
the late mining heir was married four times and fathered three children , two of whom are involved in the @entity150 family business			0

the university student , who appeared in court on monday , said her relationship with her father was ' sporadic '			0
the defendants in the matter are executor @entity82 , @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 ms @entity118 , who is also mr @entity17 's daughter , took over the reins at @entity140 shortly after he died when she was aged 40			2
the @entity167 is related to the @entity170 winery in @entity171 bought by mr @entity17 - who was reportedly not a drinker - in 1991 .			0

@entity173 , daughter of the late @entity17 , won a claim to $ 25 million
she was originally left a $ 3 million trust which she said was inadequate
her iron ore magnate father died in 2012 and was estimated to be worth $ 1.5 billion
