@entity1 new - boy @entity0 has made an instant impact at @entity3 , scoring three goals in four games , for the @entity1			1
here @entity6 takes a look at @entity3 's current hero			2
there was n't a big song and dance about him signing was there ? no , he slipped under the radar somewhat			0
he arrived from @entity16 for just Â£ 3.5million			0
if he carries on the way he 'll prove one of the bargains of the season			0
@entity0 celebrates after scoring his third goal of the season in @entity1 's 3 - 1 win over @entity24 what are his attributes ? certainly his pace			1
the forward 's rapidness caused @entity24 's defence major problems on saturday and @entity1 's rivals can expect more of the same			1
his versatility and directness will be key for the @entity1 , with the @entity35 international able to play anywhere across the forward line			1
did he have any other summer suitors ? @entity43 , with their strong knowledge of @entity42 football , were interested in the @entity0 , but @entity44 beat his former club to the punch			0
@entity0 competes with his namesake @entity47 during the @entity49 clash at @entity3 the deal nearly fell through , however , when the @entity1 tried to change the structure of the deal , forcing @entity16 to release this strongly worded statement : ' the @entity55 club unilaterally decided to propose a loan deal with an option to purchase instead of a permanent deal , which does not correspond to @entity16 's expectations and contradicts all the terms that had been agreed last week between the two clubs			1
' @entity16 regret this clear lack of respect , which is unacceptable , from @entity1 towards @entity16 and also the player			2
as a result , @entity16 reserve the right to approach the international sport court and assert their rights and defender their interests			0
@entity0 's goal against @entity24 came from a beautifully floated cross-shot into the corner ' @entity16 had released @entity0 from his professional duties during matchday 1 of the @entity75 championship by giving him leave to take a medical in @entity55 to complete the last stage of the deal			1
' three in four is a good return , what 's his goal record like ? not bad , he 's scored 40 goals for @entity16 in his previous two seasons			2
they were all out of the @entity42 top - flight , though .			0

@entity0 scored in @entity1 's 3 - 1 win over @entity24 at @entity3
@entity1 new signing has now scored three goals in four games
@entity35 international arrived from @entity16 , although deal almost fell through
