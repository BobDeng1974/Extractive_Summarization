pregnant @entity7 is n't convinced by the idea , calling it ' disgusting ' , but the idea of wet nursing is actually an age - old parenting method that dates back to the ancient @entity13			2
sisters @entity14 and @entity16 have seven children between them and often breastfeed their neices and nephews			1
they are both members of the pro-breastfeeding group @entity22 and say that cross-feeding is natural and convenient and has even brought their children closer together			1
@entity14 , 26 , who has two daughters @entity41 , four , and @entity42 , two , said : ' we enjoy breastfeeding , at the end of the day its all about choice			1
it 's a convenience thing as well as emotionally comforting			2
i did n't want to give my children formula , that 's just a choice i made , so it gave me great emotional comfort to know that if my sister was looking after my daughter she could feed her			2
' her sister @entity16 , 30 , who has five children , explained : ' there was never any big conversation about it it happened naturally when my sister went out one day and was nervous [ about leaving her daughter ] and i said if she cries shall i feed her ? ' ' how often and how much has varied over time			1
it 's all about meeting the needs of the children			2
' the two women have been breastfeeding each others children for the past four years			1
@entity16 , a full - time mother to @entity71 , 13 , @entity72 , 11 , @entity73 , seven , @entity74 , four , and @entity75 , two , will sometimes breastfeed friends ' children too			1
she has started a wet nurse @entity78 in the @entity80 to connect mothers who need breast milk due to an emergency or illness the women appeared on this morning to defend their lifestyle on thursday she said : ' breastfeeding is only a small part of your parenting ethos			1
infant feeding is a bonding process but it 's a small part of a big picture			2
in a recent interview with @entity95 student midwife @entity14 said : ' we ’re like one family unit really , ' @entity16 , who is in the process of becoming a registered childminder , added : ' it ’s natural			1
i see breastfeeding my baby and my sister ’s baby as part of motherhood — and sisterhood			0
' if @entity7 and @entity5 do decide to breastfeed each others babies , they wo n’t be the first and they definitely wo n’t be the last			0
' for for more information visit the @entity113 website when a woman breast - feeds someone else ’s baby it is called ’ wet - nursing ’			0
it was an ancient occupation mentioned in many early medical texts , including those by @entity121 and @entity122			0
@entity124 nurses might act as foster parents for motherless babies or those whose mother was simply ill or not able to produce enough @entity128 - nursing in @entity129 increased steadily from the 1000s onwards as urbanisation increased			0
country women , usually from farming families , were preferred to town women			1
foundling hospitals , which took in abandoned babies , became an increasing source of income for wet nurses			0
the traditional wet nurse was expected to have a strong body , good milk and to be sympathetic , clean and tidy , active and of good character			0
she would wet - nurse the infant until it was weaned from breast milk , and might then remain long enough to become the child 's nanny			0
the wet nurse was sometimes considered a member of the @entity151 areas were not immune to plague or to smallpox , and epidemic diseases gradually increased the risks of wet - nursing			0
