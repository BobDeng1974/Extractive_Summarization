on september 15 next year , @entity0 will witness an extraordinary sight			1
high in the heavens , the @entity2 will turn an eerie blood - red — filling the night sky with fiery radiance , as if @entity7 , the planet of war , has suddenly burst from its natural orbit and arrived on our doorstep			1
this spectacular vision will be the culmination of a rare — and , in the eyes of some , deeply ominous — astrological event , which began this week			1
on tuesday , millions of people across @entity19 and much of the rest of the @entity17 saw exactly such a blood - red moon glowing above their heads for around an hour - and - a - half			1
that same moon will return over @entity24 three times in the next 17 months , making its final dramatic appearance over @entity0			1
it will be the culmination of a rare astrological event that started this week when @entity19 and much of the @entity17 witnessed the phenomenon astronomers call this run of red moons a ‘ tetrad ’ but some doom - mongers have a different name for it : the @entity39			1
they insist that between the first and last eclipse , the world will be plunged into a cataclysmic downward spiral predicted by the @entity43			1
this decline presages @entity45 , the arrival of the anti-christ and the @entity47 of @entity48			2
forget rising sea levels , the @entity51 calendar and @entity52 — this is the big one			2
‘ there will be signs in the @entity56 , @entity2 , and stars … now when these things begin to happen , look up and lift up your heads , because your redemption draws near			0
’ so said @entity62 in @entity64 ’s gospel			0
in times gone by , people were understandably terrified of these ‘ blood moons ’			1
our ancestors greeted these infrequent and inexplicable arrivals in the night sky as harbingers of disaster or great change			0
as superstition gave way to greater scientific understanding in the 15th century , scientists discovered the @entity24 orbits the @entity56 , and the @entity2 spins around the @entity24			1
a blood moon , they came to realise , occurs when the @entity56 , @entity24 and @entity2 align , and the @entity2 slips into the @entity24 ’s shadow			1
it does n’t darken completely because some sunlight still reaches it after passing through the @entity24 ’s atmosphere			1
but the light — and therefore the @entity2 — takes on a reddish hue			0
however , there are still many who have looked upon this week ’s moon with apprehension			1
for tuesday ’s was a very special one			2
it was the first of four consecutive total lunar eclipses , with no partial eclipses in between			1
the moon glows a red hue during the total lunar eclipse on tuesday over @entity98			1
it was the first of four total lunar eclipses that will take place this year and next rational - minded astronomers will point out that while such tetrads are rare , they are not unheard of			1
and they have never yet heralded the end of days			0
indeed , there have been 62 since the @entity106			0
ah , counter the prophets of doom , but this one is different			0
this particular tetrad coincides with two of @entity112 ’s holiest days			2
and the @entity113 , the @entity114 and @entity115 , inevitably figure large in the @entity43 predictions of the @entity117			0
this week ’s eclipse coincided with @entity119 , the most important festival in the @entity113 calendar , as will the third eclipse , which falls on april 4 next year			1
the second and fourth eclipses , on october 8 this year and september 15 next year , both fall on @entity125 , or the @entity125			1
so these eclipses are deemed to be especially significant			0
but there ’s still more , say advocates of what has been dubbed the @entity130			0
according to a clutch of number - crunching @entity19 pastors , each of the last three occasions when tetrads have fallen over @entity119 and @entity125 coincided with traumatic events for the @entity113			1
a tetrad in 1493 - 1494 came just after the 1492 expulsion of the @entity113 from @entity138 , while a 1949 - 1950 tetrad followed just after the establishment of the state of @entity142 and the first @entity143			2
as for the most recent tetrad , in 1967 - 1968 , it started just before the @entity146 , when @entity142 was once again threatened by its enemies			2
astronomers call this run of lunar eclipses a ' tetrad ' but some doom - mongers have a different name for the event ( pictured in the skies over the @entity156 in @entity157 on tuesday ) - the end of the world the @entity43 ’s @entity160 , which tells how the world will end , makes clear the @entity47 will be preceded by @entity162 being surrounded by armies			1
the resulting strife , plague and pestilence , during which @entity167 will judge non-believers , will last seven years before @entity48 returns to @entity24			1
with @entity170 aflame , @entity171 in turmoil , @entity173 throwing its weight around and the @entity175 threatening @entity142 , you do n’t need to be a wild - eyed conspiracy theorist ( though it helps ) to see signs of impending destruction			0
the tetrad is n’t just a sign of things to come , says @entity184 pastor @entity183 , a popular @entity19 ‘ televangelist ’ who ’s made a fortune from predicting @entity45			1
he claims the four blood moons are messages from @entity167 projected on to the heavens			2
‘ the question , ’ he asks , ‘ is are we listening ? ’ he and another pastor , @entity192 , of @entity193 , are ‘ @entity194 ’			0
they first stumbled on the theory in 2008 after matching @entity198 eclipse records with moments in @entity113 history			2
they can quote bible - verse after verse about how the ‘ @entity205 ’ will be presaged by a bloody or darkened moon			2
they argue that the very first chapter of the @entity43 , @entity208 , makes clear that @entity167 wanted to communicate with @entity209 , creating the @entity56 , @entity2 and stars to provide ‘ signs ’			0
the @entity213 ’s @entity212 speaks of how ‘ the sun shall be turned into darkness , and the moon into blood , before the great and the terrible day of the @entity218 comes ’			2
this week 's eclipse coincided with @entity119 , the most important festival in the @entity113 calender , as will the third which falls on april4 next year			1
the second and fourth eclipses on october 8 this year and september 15 next year both fall on @entity125 , or the @entity225 , so they are deemed especially significant the @entity160 also talks of how , just before the @entity229 , ‘ the whole moon turned blood red ’			1
in a prophecy that is repeated again and again , @entity230 speaks of the @entity47 : ‘ @entity56 will be dark when it rises and the @entity2 will not shed its light			0
’ pastor @entity192 says he has sold more than 70,000 copies of his new book , @entity235 : decoding the @entity236 , in just four weeks			0
but that ’s nothing compared with his prophet - of - doom rival , mr @entity183 , whose @entity130 : something is about to @entity241 was one of @entity19 ’s best - selling books for several weeks when it came out last year			1
mr @entity192 initially claimed the tetrad ’s final eclipse of september next year would coincide with the @entity47			1
but that ignored the golden rule of successful apocalypse prediction — if you do n’t want to look silly , do n’t tie yourself down to dates			0
he is now wisely hedging his bets			0
‘ i ’m not saying whether it is or is n’t going to be the @entity47 in a year and a half			2
i do n’t have the word “ stupid ” written on my head , ’ he told me			0
‘ but we are living in the @entity205			0
i believe the @entity47 is approaching			0
’ pastor @entity183 believes the same			0
tuesday marked the dawn of a ‘ hugely significant event ’ for the world , he said			2
‘ @entity167 is shouting to us : “ something big is about to happen ! ” ’ centuries ago , people would bang on pots and pans during a red eclipse , trying to scare away the monster that was eating the moon			1
what are the fearful doing now ? according to a number of @entity19 pastors , each of the last three occasions when tetrads have fallen over @entity119 and @entity125 , it has coincided with traumatic events for the @entity278 most recent tetrad in 1967 - 1968 started just before the @entity146 when @entity142 was once again threatened by its enemies @entity19 is rife with ‘ @entity280 ’ , an estimated three million people who are stockpiling food and weapons — some even digging bunkers — in preparation for what they see as the imminent collapse of the @entity19 some believe @entity290 ’s administration will cause this nightmare scenario but just as many believe in an apocalypse as predicted in the @entity43 and set into motion by this week ’s blood moon			1
of course , those who fervently believe in this particular doomsday theoretically have nothing to be scared about			0
they are the @entity167 - fearing folks who ’ll be taken up to @entity298			0
it ’s the rest of the world that has to worry			0
pastor @entity192 insists nobody in his 800 - strong congregation is fretting about the approaching storm : ‘ when there ’s a @entity47 and they ’re righteous , they have nothing to fear			0
’ however many @entity307 , even in @entity19 ’s fundamentalist @entity308 , have no time for the prophecy			1
@entity311 , a preacher and biblical prophecy expert , has written his own book telling the faithful not to worry about blood moons			2
‘ i know people who are very concerned over this blood moon prophecy , ’ he says			2
‘ these sorts of theories are gaining traction because people are fearful			0
‘ with @entity170 , @entity324 and @entity175 , as well as mounting social and economic problems , a lot of people are ready to believe that everything is spinning out of control and coming to an end			0
’ there is , he insists , no need to panic			0
let ’s hope he ’s right !			0

on tuesday millions in @entity19 saw a total lunar eclipse in the skies
that moon will return over @entity24 three times in the next 17 months
astronomers call the rare run of red moons a tetrad
on september 15 next year , @entity0 will witness the spectacle
