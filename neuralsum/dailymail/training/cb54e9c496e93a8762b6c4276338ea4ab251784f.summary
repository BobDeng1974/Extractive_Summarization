far from being self - indulgent , wallowing in the past can leave you feeling happier about the future			2
individuals who are nostalgic about their earlier lives also have a more positive outlook over the years to come , a study has found			1
the findings suggest that recalling happy memories improves your sense of wellbeing			2
@entity11 tend to focus on visual details , such as the colour of the decorations or the presents given ‘ nostalgia raises self - esteem , which in turn heightens optimism , ’ said study co-author dr @entity16 , from the @entity17			1
‘ memories of the past can help to maintain current feelings of self - worth and can contribute to a brighter outlook on the future			1
' our findings imply that nostalgia , by promoting optimism , could help individuals cope with psychological adversity			1
’ in the study , published in the journal @entity34 , participants were asked to recall a nostalgic event and write about it			1
a second group were asked to record an ordinary event from their past			0
the team found that the number of optimistic words included in the nostalgic narratives were significantly higher than in the ordinary stories			1
in a second experiment , participants were played either a nostalgic or ‘ neutral ’ song			0
those listening to the former reported higher levels of optimism than the other group			1
a previous study showed that pensioners who reminisced about their youth saw significant improvements in memory and six hour chats boosted recall by an average of 12 per cent by promoting optimism , nostalgia could help individuals cope with psychological adversity			1
the study found that remembering times gone by can raise self esteem and heighten optimism			1
the number of optimistic words included in nostalgic narratives were significantly higher than in the ordinary stories			2
researchers also found that people who listened to nostalgic songs reported higher levels of optimism			1
the group was also presented with two sets of lyrics – one of which had been identified as nostalgic by half of them			0
when asked to complete questions about how they felt , those who read the nostalgic lyrics reported a more positive outlook compared to those who read the control lyrics			2
dr @entity16 said : ‘ @entity88 is experienced by virtually everyone and we know that it can maintain psychological comfort			2

’ previous studies have shown that reminiscing can be good for your health			0
pensioners who got into groups and reminisced about their youth – including wartime experiences – saw significant improvements in memory			0
just six half - hour chats boosted recall by an average of 12 per cent			0
importantly , care home residents with dementia , including some in the late stages of the disease , also experienced improvements , with recall around 8 per cent better			0
it is thought that the simple act of swapping stories makes use of parts of the brain that might otherwise lie dormant , reinvigorating the person ’s ability to remember			0
however , reminiscing one - on - one with a carer was not beneficial , meaning that the sense of togetherness fostered by teamwork is important to the process .			0

the study also found that listening to nostalgic songs made people more optimistic than those who listened to a tune *unattached* to memories
scientists believe that by promoting optimism , nostalgia could help individuals cope with psychological adversity
