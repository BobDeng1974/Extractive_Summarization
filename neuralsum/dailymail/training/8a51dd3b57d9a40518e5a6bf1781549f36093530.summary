by @entity0 a scandal - hit ambulance service has been criticised for spending nearly £ 250,000 on pr staff to defend its reputation			1
dozens of patients have died in ' unexpected or avoidable ' circumstances while being attended to by the @entity8			1
but last year , the trust spent £ 5,000 a week on five members of staff in its @entity13 department , whose job is to respond to criticism and promote the service 's image			1
criticism : @entity8 spent £ 250,000 on @entity13 last year ( file photo ) the @entity20 covers a population of 5.8million in @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27			1
it has been accused of poor performance , which may have contributed to patients ' deaths , while a report this year found that its response times were unacceptably slow			1
the trust spent a total of £ 247,406 on staffing its pr operations , a sum which local mp @entity38 , who is also a gp , described as ' extraordinary '			1
' what is particularly distressing about this is that the @entity42 has a track record of failing to invest in the right areas , ' said dr @entity38 , mp for @entity27 and @entity46			2
' £ 250,000 could pay for 10 paramedics working on the ground , so they need to have a serious re-think about how they spend their money			2
' @entity52 , of the @entity53 , added : ' it 's a ludicrous amount of money			2
what people want is an effective and efficient ambulance service - not a highly - paid communications team spinning the news			2
' victims : 14 - year - old @entity62 , left , and infant @entity63 , right , both died before an ambulance could arrive at the scene a spokesman for the @entity20 said : ' the communications team has already been reduced by more than £ 50,000 which will be put into front - line services and we are reviewing all of our support services			1
' the communication team provide a vital reference point for patients , stakeholders and the media , raising awareness of the work of the ambulance service			0
' earlier this year , @entity81 figures revealed that the trust had been implicated in 155 ' serious incidents ' since april 2010			1
of those , 59 related to the unexpected or avoidable death of a patient - although the trust insisted that it was not responsible for the deaths			1
after the trust was publicly criticised by mps at a parliamentary hearing , five non-executive directors resigned and new plans to improve the service were put into place			1
a report in january concluded that the service had got better in some ways , but ruled that its response times were still unacceptably poor			0
chief executive @entity97 , who was hired in december , this week announced that more ambulances would be introduced and resources shifted from the back office to frontline services			0
the trust 's total budget came to £ 226million during the fiscal year 2012/13			1
tragic : @entity105 died from a brain haemorrhage as his parents waited for an ambulance @entity105 , 26 , died from a brain haemorrhage after an ambulance took two hours to reach his home			0
in november , the 26 - year - old collapsed in his bathroom in the village of @entity115 in @entity26 , after returning from a shift at a local hotel with a headache			1
mr @entity105 's parents watched as his condition deteriorated , culminating in him coughing up blood and collapsing on the bathroom floor			0
they dialled 999 at 11.15pm but an ambulance did not arrive until after 1am - taking more than six times longer than targets dictate			2
by the time he arrived at the @entity26 and @entity127 , nothing could be done to save his life			0
in september , the @entity129 was branded chaotic by a coroner investigating the death of three - month - old @entity132			0
@entity132 stopped breathing after suffering a fit at her home in @entity136 , @entity26 and died before ambulance crews arrived			0
coroner @entity138 branded the waiting time of 26 minutes - more than three times longer than national targets dictate - ‘ wholly indefensible '			0
the inquest at @entity143 heard how an emergency first response car struggled to find the new build house because its satnav was not up - to - date and ' there were too many blue doors '			0
in june , an inquiry was opened after a 14 - year - old girl died from an asthma attack while an ambulance went to the wrong address			2
paramedics were called when @entity62 , of @entity155 , @entity23 , collapsed with breathing problems during an @entity158 meeting at an @entity160 base			0
but a call handler is said to have sent the ambulance to another base seven miles away			0
by the time a second ambulance arrived at the correct location , crews were unable to save her and she was pronounced dead at the scene .			0
