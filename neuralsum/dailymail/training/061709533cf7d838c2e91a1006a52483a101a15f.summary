by @entity0 published : 13:44 est , 19 december 2012 updated : 08:11 est , 20 december 2012 doctors placed a do not resuscitate order on a patient ’s notes without her knowledge or consent , a high court judge said yesterday			0
grandmother @entity8 , 63 , had terminal lung cancer when she was admitted to hospital with a fractured neck following a serious car accident			1
despite her poor prognosis , her family say she ‘ wanted to have every minute of every day ’ and told doctors she wanted to be included in conversations about her care			0
patient : @entity8 , pictured with her husband @entity19 , did not consent to having a @entity21 notice put on her medical records so she was ‘ distressed ’ to discover in march last year that a @entity25 ( @entity24 ) order had been placed on her notes			2
when mrs @entity8 objected , it was cancelled by staff at @entity29 , in @entity30 , only to be reinstated three days later			1
mrs @entity8 died two days after the second notice was issued			1
yesterday , judge @entity32 said she did not accept the evidence of dr @entity34 , a consultant on the neuro - critical care unit , that he had discussed the first order with mrs @entity8 but forgot to record it in her medical notes in written findings , she said : ‘ there is nothing in the records which suggests any agreement to dna - cpr by mrs @entity8			1
’ she said dr @entity34 may have kept mrs @entity8 in the dark to ‘ spare her a conversation which he knew was likely to cause distress to a suffering patient ’			1
legal battle : mr @entity52 stands outside the @entity53 with his daughters @entity55 ( second from right ) and @entity57 ( right ) and solicitors @entity59 ( left ) and @entity60 ( second left ) mrs @entity8 received treatment , and died , at @entity29 in @entity30			1
she was terminally ill and had been involved in a car crash but the findings will reignite the debate over whether patients have the right to decide whether they are resuscitated , or whether the doctor always knows best			2
fears : mrs @entity8 told her family that staff ' wanted to get rid of her ' clinicians are not required by law to gain the consent of patients , but hospital policy states they should discuss it where possible			1
the @entity8 family claim their mother ’s human rights were breached and that @entity80 acted unlawfully when they ignored her wishes			0
they will find out tomorrow whether the case can proceed to a judicial review , where they can challenge the trust ’s policy and the national guidelines set down by the secretary of state for health			0
the family ’s @entity90 , @entity92 , told @entity94 ’s @entity93 : ‘ when the case is a matter of life or death , it is not good enough for a trust to have a policy that is confusing			0
‘ there is a real problem out there and this is not a hypothetical or academic issue			0
’ after the first dna - cpr order was removed , a second one was placed on mrs @entity8 ’s medical records three days later when her condition deteriorated			2
mrs @entity8 ’s four daughters and husband , retired engineer @entity19 , 65 , say they were not properly informed about this notice either			2
but judge @entity113 accepted the evidence of medical staff who said mrs @entity8 did not want to discuss her prognosis and that doctors ‘ had discussed the relevant issues with the family ’			1
she said staff believed ' her family were in denial as to her prognosis '			0
judge @entity113 said : ‘ amongst clinicians responsible for the care of mrs @entity8 , there was unanimity : a dna - cpr order was appropriate in order to protect her from an undignified and cruel procedure which was of no clinical benefit			1
’ mrs @entity8 ’s four daughters , including @entity57 who attended court yesterday , say they were given graphic accounts of resuscitation to pressure them to agree to a second dna - cpr			2
daughter @entity135 told the hearing : ‘ they said they would jump up and down on mum ’s chest			0
‘ they would burn her with electrodes , they would break her ribs that were n’t already broken			0
’ lord @entity90 , speaking on behalf of the hospital , said : ‘ whether or not to give cpr in circumstances like this is a matter for the clinicians , ultimately			0

grandmother @entity8 , 63 , objected when she found note
judge @entity32 says consultant wanted to ' avoid conversation '
mrs @entity8 had terminal lung cancer and broke neck in car crash
