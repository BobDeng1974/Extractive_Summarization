by @entity0 published : 11:48 est , 30 april 2012 updated : 13:39 est , 30 april 2012 the app grades radiation exposure as low , high and medium , and offers tips on how to lower your levels worriers rejoice - a new @entity9 app tells you exactly how much electromagnetic radiation your handset is blasting into your brain , and even tells you when to hold it away from your head			1
but @entity16 owners are n't so lucky - the app is n't available for @entity19 's handsets , after it was personally turned down by late ceo @entity20 in a terse email that simply said , ' no interest			1
' the app warns when radiation levels from a phone are high - taking into account the model , and what is transmitting through its aerials , and even offers tips on how to lower your radiation levels			1
' @entity32 is a free app that alerts you when your phone radiation level spikes , and offers tips to help you lower it , ' say its creators			1
the phone senses the activities of components inside the handset that lead to radiation ' spikes ' , and suggest you hold the phone away from your head - or even hang up			1
the app has been downloaded 10,000 times in less than a week			0
it looks unlikely , however , that @entity19 users will be able to enjoy @entity32			0
@entity19 's @entity20 was well known for personally responding to numerous emails from the public			2
but some of his replies were a little more terse than others , as the bosses of @entity32 discovered			0
the ceo , in response to a politely worded email asking for assistance to get their app off the ground , simply said ‘ no interest ’ ( sent from his @entity16 , naturally )			1
the app senses when components are about to release high levels of radiation , and warns users to switch to a headset or speakerphone your phone is already equipped with what you need to protect yourself			1
you just do n’t have access to that information			0
deep in the guts of a phone ’s circuitry , we found that components actually gather radiation - related data			2
we learned how to gather this information and we built tawkon : our app tracks the contributing factors to rises in radiation and simply suggests you to make a quick change — as you begin a call or while you are in the middle of one , ' say the app 's creators			2
' in 2010 , @entity32 launched a jailbroken @entity16 app ( @entity20 told us personally @entity19 was n’t interested in it ; we assume he was n’t keen on discussing radiation in relation to the @entity16 ) , as well as a @entity98 app. ' in 2011 , we successfully launched our @entity9 app , which is now where the core development focus lies			1
in april 2012 we launched our native @entity101 ' @entity20 rejected the app , which tells users how much radiation is absorbed			1
it 's calculated by using the location to phone masts and how the phone is held no convincing evidence has been revealed that mobile phones damage human health in spite of an ‘ explosion ’ in research into the issue over the past decade , according to a review of scientific studies billed as the most comprehensive yet			0
driving while using a mobile phone remains the one established health risk of mobile phones , a leading scientist said as a report on exposure to radiofrequency ( @entity125 ) electromagnetic fields emitted by devices such as mobile phones was published			0
the review found that a large number of studies have been published on cancer risks in relation to mobile phone use but overall the results have not demonstrated that the use of mobile phones causes brain tumours or any other type of cancer			0
@entity20 is known for responding to numerous emails from the public			2
some responses are more terse than others , as @entity32 bosses found out but the report , from the @entity147 ’s ( @entity147 ) independent advisory group on non-ionising radiation ( @entity149 ) , warned that it was ‘ important ’ to continue to monitor all the evidence as there was little information on the risks beyond 15 years from first exposure			2
this monitoring should include monitoring national brain tumour trends which have so far given ‘ no indication ’ of any risk , the report recommended			0
the @entity147 said it would continue to advise a ‘ precautionary ’ approach and keep the science under close review			0
the agency recommends that ‘ excessive ’ use of mobile phones by children should be discouraged while adults should make their own choices as to whether they wish to reduce their own exposure .			0

app monitors radiation from @entity9 handsets
warns you of high levels - and says to switch to speakerphone
lets you monitor family radiation levels as well
not *allowed* on @entity16 after personal rejection by @entity20
