@entity0 are steeling themselves to face an @entity3 pack regimented by ' one of the best forwards coaches in the world ' at @entity7 on saturday			1
@entity0 forwards coach @entity8 hailed @entity3 counterpart @entity9 for creating a ' world - class scrum ' , while calling on @entity0 to sharpen up after 29 - 15 defeat in @entity12			1
@entity13 revealed boss @entity14 has led several @entity0 fact - finding missions to @entity3 , where the two sets of coaches have traded ideas and forged lasting friendships			1
forwards coach @entity9 has been praised for his work with @entity3 by @entity8 ' @entity9 is in my opinion one of the best forwards coaches in the world and a good friend of mine , ' said @entity13 , who doubles as @entity0 's attack coordinator			1
' the great thing about rugby is the friends you make			0
we coached against each other for the first time in 2012 , what a great guy and what a great coaching staff			0
' just look at guys like @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 ; @entity14 and i have visited the northern hemisphere quite a few times in the last year , we 've had a few coffees together			0
' and like we did with the @entity47 a few weeks ago i 'm sure we 're going to have a drink before and after the game , talk about their challenges , our challenges , where the game is going , what you think			2
' at the end of the day we 're much bigger than just ourselves and just this test match , it 's about the game , and what a fantastic coaching group they have , and they are good friends of ours			2
' @entity13 ( left ) will cross paths with @entity9 when @entity3 host @entity0 on saturday @entity0 dominated territory and possession in @entity65 on saturday but slipped to defeat owing to a host of handling errors and a costly yellow card for replacement hooker @entity69			1
@entity12 's physicality and technical nous caught the @entity0 out , with @entity13 admitting their refusal to bind on an early maul was a ' shock '			1
@entity13 believes former @entity75 and @entity3 prop @entity9 has built a pack that is now the envy of the world under boss @entity40			2
' you 've just got to look at the way their forwards conduct themselves on and off the field , the way they prepare , they are always well - prepared at lineout time in attack and defence , ' said @entity13			0
@entity13 believes @entity9 's ( right ) efforts have seen @entity3 develop a world - class scrum ' they have a pretty solid maul			2
they put us under pressure in @entity0 two years ago ; we played them four times that year			0
' it 's a world - class scrum and a world - class plan			0
whenever we come up against them we know it 's a challenge			0
' @entity0 may look to parachute @entity100 in at fly - half to face @entity3 ahead of fast - rising star @entity102			1
head coach @entity14 wants his @entity104 2015 squad all - but nailed down by the end of the current tour , and is intent on giving opportunities to impress this month			0
@entity0 may start @entity100 ( centre left ) at fly - half for saturday 's match against @entity3 @entity13 refused to criticise the @entity0 ' half - back duo of @entity102 and @entity112 in saturday 's @entity12 loss however			1
the @entity0 do not expect @entity3 to change tack to exploit any perceived tactical kicking weakness , especially with @entity13 warning against @entity117 's running game			1
widely credited with helping devise @entity0 's new expansive play , former @entity119 coach @entity13 singled out @entity121 scrum - half care as one of @entity3 's chief threats			1
' it would be unfair from my side to single out individuals , as a team we made some errors in @entity12 that we 've now got to fix , ' said @entity13			0
@entity13 revealed @entity0 has ' a lot of respect ' for @entity3 scrum - half @entity117 ( centre ) ' it starts with the carry and the presentation , and sometimes the half - back gets the criticism when the presentation 's not up to scratch			1
' there were some individual errors by players but we 'll take responsibility as a team and we 've got to fix it			0
' @entity7 is a place we love to play and this is a test against a team we really respect			2
' we 're facing world - class players ; we 've a lot of respect for @entity117			0
' i do n't think they 'll pay too much attention to what @entity12 did , they will just focus on their game			0
