by @entity1 reporter published : 03:06 est , 11 march 2014 updated : 04:16 est , 11 march 2014 the capital of the @entity5 kings buried at @entity6 may have been uncovered in farmland close to the famous burial mounds			1
archaeologists believe a royal settlement once spread across more than 100 acres of what is now farmland at @entity12 in @entity13 near @entity14 , @entity15			2
they say it included a wooden palace which would have been used by @entity18 and other @entity5 rulers of @entity20 and @entity15 between the 6th and 9th centuries			1
hidden treasure : archaeologists believe they have found an ancient royal settlement which once spread across more than 100 acres of what is now farmland at @entity12 in @entity13 near @entity14 , @entity15 it was only discovered after the owner of the land raised the alarm when illegal treasure hunters started scouring the area under the cover of night			2
the site is only around four miles from the treasure - filled @entity6 burial ship which is thought to be the grave of @entity18 who died in about 624 ad			1
rumours of a royal settlement in @entity39 have persisted since it was first mentioned by the @entity41 , an 8th century monk and historian			1
but it is only now that archaeologists have unearthed what they describe as ' conclusive evidence ' to pinpoint the land where the settlement stood for around 300 years			2
a series of @entity5 coins , fragments of gold jewellery , buckles , pieces of brooches and part of a hanging bowl have been found in the fields over the past five years , indicating that a village was once there			1
a @entity60 gold tremissis coin from the late 6th century was also uncovered along with weights , suggesting that the site was an important base for foreign trade			2
another find of an unfinished bronze buckle is being seen as evidence of a metal workshop on the site			1
coins found at the @entity13 site : last night the @entity72 confirmed in a statement that the finds represented ' conclusive evidence of the existence of the long - lost @entity77 settlement at @entity13 ' @entity78 began investigations along with the @entity80 and @entity81 after illicit treasure hunters with metal detectors targeted fields around @entity13 in night - time raids in 2009			1
after sir @entity86 alerted the authorities to evidence of the so - called ' night hawks ' targeting his land , trusted volunteers with metal detectors were allowed to scan the fields for anything of archaeological value			0
over five years the search uncovered 15 silver @entity5 coins in one field , including one used as an ornament			1
another two @entity5 sceattas , a type of ancient coin from the 8th century , were found in another field along with silver and copper - alloy brooch fragments			1
a copy of a 7th century tremissis coin and an 8th century handle - shaped brooch were found in a third area			0
@entity110 history : rumours of a royal settlement in @entity39 have persisted since it was mentioned by the @entity41 in the 8th century other finds included coins from the @entity116 era , evidence of an @entity119 enclosure and early medieval trinkets , suggesting the site was occupied for hundreds of years before and after @entity5 times			1
last night the @entity72 confirmed in a statement that the finds represented ' conclusive evidence of the existence of the long - lost @entity77 settlement at @entity13 '			2
a statement said that archaeologists had surveyed 400 acres of land in the search for the settlement			2
the investigation identified the 125 acre site by metal - detecting , aerial photography , chemical analysis and geophysics - a process of scanning the ground beneath the surface for evidence of buried features			0
the @entity72 said that finds included ' fragments of exquisite gold jewellery , @entity5 pennies and weights associated with trade , and metal offcuts from a smith 's workshop '			1
the @entity150 , which helped identify the finds , described them as ' conclusive evidence of the long - lost @entity5 royal settlement whose people buried their kings at @entity6 '			1
a spokesman for the institute described the site as being of ' huge historical and archaeological significance '			0
the find has been described as possibly the most significant for @entity5 history since the 1939 discovery of the burial ship at @entity6			1
investigations of the 27m long ship led to the rewriting of @entity5 history as it emerged that craftsmen from the era were much more advanced than previously thought			1
the treasures found there included included gild and gem - encrusted dress fittings , an ornate ceremonial helmet , shield and sword , as well as pieces of silver plate from @entity181			0
at this new site , while the exact location of the suspected royal palace has not been pinpointed , archaeologists are convinced it would have been there			0
@entity41 wrote in his 8th - century book , an @entity187 , that it was ' the king 's country - seat of @entity13 '			2
it is believed that in the 7th century the settlement would have equalled @entity192 in size before going into decline two centuries later when @entity192 became the main regional centre			0
similarities : a gilded bronze mount from a harness found at @entity13 , which is similar to an example from one of the @entity6 burials			2
the discovery of the 27m long ship led to the rewriting of @entity5 history @entity206 , chairman of the @entity80 , said archaeologists working on the project were ' very excited ' about what has been unearthed			2
the site of two 6th - and 7th - century cemeteries , @entity6 's discovery shed light on a period of @entity216 's past on the margin between myth , legend and historical documentation			1
use of the site culminated at a time when @entity226 Â¦ dwald , the ruler of the @entity222 , held power among the @entity216 people and played a dynamic if ambiguous part in the establishment of @entity233 rulership in @entity216			0
it is generally thought most likely that he is the person found in the undisturbed ship burial , that held a wealth of @entity5 artefacts			1
excavated in 1939 , the ship is one of the most magnificent archaeological finds in @entity216			0
the investigations are expected to carry on for at least another year , with much scientific work to be done and the papers detailing the finds still to be written			0
mr @entity206 said the finds suggested the area was a settlement , meeting place or trading station for a variety of @entity5 people including those of high - status , probably kings			1
he said the investigations took place around the diary of the working farm , waiting until fields had been harvested , with a team of four authorised and responsible metal detector enthusiasts combing the fields			0
' the finds are extremely interesting			0
they consist of mainly tiny pieces , not the big sparkly stuff discovered at the ship burial , ' he added			0
' but the finds show there has been human activity at the site over a long period , high status activity			0
it does n't confirm one way or another that there was a big royal palace - it does n't show there was and it does n't mean there was n't one			0
' it shows there were high - status people at the site and there was trading with places that were very far away			0
it is fascinating and very exciting			0
' archaeologists work at the @entity6 site : painstaking excavations of the burial ship led to the rewriting of @entity5 history as it emerged that craftsmen from the era were much more advanced than thought a burial mound at @entity6 : the site of two 6th - and 7th - century cemeteries , @entity6 's discovery shed light on a period of @entity216 's past on the margin between myth , legend and historical documentation			1
@entity309 , lead archaeological officer at @entity78 for the project , said there was an ' exceptional @entity5 settlement here , and that it was flourishing at the time of @entity18 '			1
sir @entity86 , 67 , who owns the land where the settlement has been found , said : ' the area is on a number of fields which are now used for growing wheat , barley and oil seed rape			0
' my understanding is that there would have been people leaving here and people of high status , like kings , would visit			0
it is an on - going scientific and archaeological investigation			0
' a map shows the relative locations of @entity13 and the burial mounds of @entity6 in @entity15 @entity334 , the @entity78 cabinet member for @entity335 said : ' we are very grateful to sir @entity86 who alerted us to on - going illicit looting on his land and has allowed the @entity340 and the metal detecting team regular access to his fields			1
' from the start it was clear that this site produced exceptionally important finds that could relate to the royal settlement cited in @entity41			1
' the combination of the exemplary work by the detector users with other survey methods is allowing us to build a detailed picture of past activity , including international trade and fine metalworking			0
' intricate : a helmet found at @entity6 which is thought to date back to about 625 ad royal shoulder - clasps decorated with inlaid gold , enamel and garnet , found in the burial mounds at @entity6 professor @entity362 , of @entity363 and @entity364 said : ' the survey has identified a site of national and indeed international importance for the understanding of the @entity5 elite and their @entity371 connections			1
' the quality of some of the metalwork leaves no doubt that it was made for and used by the highest ranks of society			0
these exceptional discoveries are truly significant in throwing new light on early @entity380 and the origins of @entity5 kingdoms			2
' @entity72 , in conjunction with @entity78 's archaeological service is staging an exhibition of the finds at @entity13 at the @entity6 visitor centre between march 31 and october 15 this year			2
the relics will then move permanently to @entity389 .			0

experts say the site would have been used by @entity5 @entity18
it is about four miles away from the famous burial mounds at @entity6
find confirms account of a settlement given by the @entity41
