the @entity10 were moments away from the fourth round , having held on to @entity0 ' goal at the start of the second half , before @entity16 smashed home a stoppage - time equaliser which means the two sides will now go head - to - head again in east @entity21 on january 13			1

he told the club 's website : ' @entity37 is disappointing at any time , so to do it in injury - time in the @entity4 knowing we will have to play another game now is even more disappointing			2
' but we played well at @entity3 , against @entity40 and also in the second half against @entity42			0
' we will go again at @entity22 on saturday , and they have got a couple of lads out too			2
we are seventh in the league and still in the @entity4 , so it is all to play for			2
' @entity26 hopes to have striker @entity47 fit from a foot injury for the trip to south @entity50 , and has been boosted by the news of @entity54 midfielder @entity53 's international retirement , so he will now be available rather than away at the @entity55			0
@entity0 ( left ) , pictured celebrating his goal , is confident that @entity1 will bounce back against @entity22 @entity1 's players face a trip to the @entity59 on saturday before a replay with @entity3 next tuesday ' we have got a difficult task now as we have only got a few days to recover for @entity22 and then we will play again on tuesday ( in the @entity4 replay ) with only a few days to recover for the next @entity8 game ( against @entity65 )			1
' it will be tough on the lads , especially with the shortage of the squad now			0
' hopefully @entity47 will be back by the weekend , but lads have just got to dig in now and pick up more points , before hopefully beating @entity3 and getting through to the next round			0
' @entity73 , meanwhile , have confirmed they do not now expect @entity1 forward @entity75 to link up with their squad for the @entity55 because of a back injury , and so the player is expected to stay in @entity21 for treatment			0
