the trio of @entity15 fans wanted to sing versions of the @entity15 's @entity17 and @entity18 on friday nights			1
@entity7 @entity6 ( left ) , 23 , said he was barred with his friends @entity9 and @entity10 because they were out of tune and ' bad for business ' but last week , staff at the @entity24 pub in @entity25 refused to let them go up on stage			2
@entity28 , who cares for the men in @entity30 supported accommodation , told the @entity32 : ' the @entity33 handed out Â­ songbooks to all the tables in the pub , but not to our residents			2
' he said he was not allowed to let the residents sing anymore			2
' but pub landlord @entity40 denied saying the singers were bad for business , insisting they were just terrible vocalists			1
@entity6 was not allowed to perform because ' he just shouts words - there is no tune ' , according to the chairman of @entity47 mr @entity40 , who is also chairman of crime / anti-social behaviour monitoring group @entity47 , added : ' @entity6 was asked not to sing purely on his ability			1
' there is no tune			0
@entity6 is a pleasant , well presented lad , he just ca n't sing			0
' the karaoke guy organises the entertainment and if it 's not successful , he wo n't come any more			0
' it has nothing to do with whether people have a disability , it 's about whether people can entertain and sing			1
staff at the @entity24 pub in @entity25 refused to let the trio go up on stage ' everyone has a right to have a go but if their audition is not successful , they do not have the right to sing again			1
' @entity70 , director of @entity71 , said the pub 's stance was nothing to do with singing ability			1
she told the @entity76 that the decision was ' totally inaccurate and insulting '			0
ms @entity70 said there was a wider issue at stake than that of them not being able to sing karaoke			0
she added : ' we are totally distraught that here we are in 2011 with very clear discrimination against three young men , purely based on the fact they have a learning disability			0
' it is most definitely not about singing ability because karaoke is not about singing ability			0
