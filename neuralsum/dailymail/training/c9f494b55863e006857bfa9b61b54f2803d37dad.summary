by @entity0 published : 20:08 est , 12 february 2013 updated : 08:07 est , 13 february 2013 @entity1 is widely prescribed for common ailments , including back pain and arthritis doctors are writing millions of prescriptions a year for a painkiller that is known to raise the risk of heart attacks and strokes , a study has warned			1
@entity1 is given by @entity12 to ease the pain of arthritis , backache , gout and other common conditions			0
a review of existing research showed the drug is one of the riskiest of its type , raising the danger of heart attacks and strokes – including fatal incidents – by up to 63 per cent			1
this risk is almost identical to that of the @entity30 ( rofecoxib ) , which was withdrawn from worldwide sales in 2004 because of cardiovascular risk			2
the study ’s authors are calling for diclofenac to be banned or severely restricted in use			1
and they accused family doctors , who issued almost five million prescriptions for the drug in @entity41 in 2011 , of being complacent about the dangers and of not warning patients of the risks			1
in a review of studies on painkillers known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( @entity49 ) , which also include ibuprofen , co-author @entity51 , of @entity52 found diclofenac had the highest risk			1
despite this , it was the most used – meaning it was prescribed more often than safer alternatives such as the painkiller naproxen			1
dr @entity51 said that the dangers of diclofenac have been well - documented , so gps are either not keeping up with the latest research or simply ignoring the warnings			2
she said : ' this drug improves symptoms but patients are not stuck for alternatives			1
' there are strong arguments to revoke its marketing authorisations globally			0
' she added that a healthy young person ’s odds of having a heart attack or stroke is so low that taking diclofenac will add little to their risk			1
however , the effect could be significant in elderly people with underlying health problems			0
@entity1 is also available over-the - counter in a lower dose @entity1 tablets and cream			0
@entity1 was prescribed almost five millions times by @entity12 in 2011 the gel is not thought to have any cardiac side - effects but the pills may , if taken in large numbers , said dr @entity51			0
dr @entity51 , who makes her argument in the journal @entity94 , urged patients not to panic and stressed that no one should come off their tablets without first speaking to their gp			2
@entity100 , of the @entity101 , said that anyone taking diclofenac and other nsaids should be made aware of the risks as well as the benefits			2
concern : dr @entity51 said there were strong arguments for banning diclofenac the charity @entity110 said there are few other effective options for those with painful , long - term conditions such as arthritis and it recommends that people take the lowest dose of the most appropriate of the painkillers for the shortest amount of time			0
a spokesman added that painkilling gels and creams are a safer alternative to pills			0
@entity127 ’s drugs watchdog , the @entity126 and @entity128 , said that a @entity130 review of the safety of diclofenac is already underway			1
a spokesman added : ‘ @entity1 is an extremely important @entity49 used for the treatment of arthritis and other painful conditions			0
‘ for most patients , the risks of side - effects are outweighed by the benefits these drugs bring in managing pain			2
‘ if people have any concerns about any nsaid they are taking , then they should speak to their doctor			0
’ @entity147 , which makes @entity148 , the low - dose form of the drug , said patient safety is its top priority and if fully supports the @entity130 review of diclofenac 's safety			1
a spokesman added that the company is confident that the information available to date shows the benefits outweigh the risks .			0
