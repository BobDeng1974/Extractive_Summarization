like any girl of her age , @entity0 loves to wear heels			1
however , shopping for them is pretty tricky			0
that 's because the 19 - year - old , from @entity8 , has one of the biggest pairs of feet of any woman in @entity12 - and at size 14 , she has only ever found shoes that fit her at a shop in @entity16			1
the 6ft 5in @entity18 student , who is double the @entity21 women ’s average size of seven , owns one pair of stilettos but finds it ‘ impossible ’ to find the right shoes			1
she is pictured ( right ) posing with @entity30 , 19 , who has a shoe size of three and stands at 5ft 3in tall compared : miss @entity0 , 19 , who is a foot size 14 , is pictured with her friend @entity33 , who has a size of three she said : ‘ i think i ’ve got the biggest feet in @entity12 , which makes it impossible to find shoes that fit			1
i own one pair of stilettos - but they ’re not very classy			2
i dream of owning a pair of @entity42			2
’ miss @entity0 - whose feet are larger than those of 6ft 7in @entity45 footballer @entity44 , a size 12 - said wearing heels puts her at 7ft , and men are often too intimidated to speak to her when she is out			1
she added : ‘ although i love being tall , i ’ve only been approached once in a club - and that was by a man who was taller than me			0
‘ besides our mutual height , we did n’t have much in common			0
i ’d rather date a man who is taller than me , but i realise that i may be raising the bar too high			0
’ all @entity57 trainers : miss @entity0 measures up her size 14 feet with friend @entity33 , who has a size three height difference : seen with her friend @entity33 , miss @entity0 said her heels put her at 7ft , and men are often too intimidated to speak to her when she is out problems that miss @entity0 encounters daily include fitting into cars and banging her head on door frames			1
she is even considering putting pipe insulator on frames in her home to prevent injury			0
' i was so relieved when my feet stopped growing			2
i was terrified i ’d end up with boat feet ' @entity0 meanwhile she faces wardrobe problems			1
finding clothes that fit is a constant battle and she is often forced to wear leggings underneath dresses which come up too short on her			0
‘ the biggest issue is finding shoes that fit me , ' she said			1
' i love shoes and it ’s so hard getting ones i like			2
there ’s only one place i can buy them in @entity16			0
last time i went i spent £ 500 on five pairs			2
’ from the age of nine she wore a bigger - than - average size nine - the same size feet as her mum @entity94 , 49 - and up to the age of 14 she grew a shoe size every year			1
she even beats @entity96 : the feet of @entity98 ( right in left photo , pictured with her friend @entity33 ) are even bigger than those of 6ft 7in @entity102 and @entity45 footballer @entity44 ( right , pictured on saturday ) she said : ‘ i was so relieved when my feet stopped growing			2
i was terrified i ’d end up with boat feet			0
’ ' i love shoes and it ’s so hard getting ones i like			0
there ’s only one place i can buy them in @entity16			0
last time i went i spent £ 500 on five pairs ' @entity0 miss @entity0 - whose 49 - year - old father @entity110 is also a size 14 , and 15 - year - old sister @entity112 is a 10 - added that her feet do n’t look that big because they are in proportion with her height			1
trousers are out of the question for @entity98 , so three - quarter length jeans with a long top are her preferred outfit			0
meanwhile the teenager is limited to just one pair of shoes for evenings out			1
for the last six years she has sported a gold pair of pumps bought from a @entity128 website which has since gone out of business			1
friends : miss @entity0 , pictured with @entity33 ( left and right ) , only has one pair of heels ( seen right ) miss @entity0 , whose feet measure 13in , has re-heeled the shoes three times , and even has to repaint them with gold fabric paint three times a year			1
' i try to keep up with the trends , but when you have to base an outfit around the same pair of shoes , it ’s not easy ' @entity0 she said : ‘ i try to keep up with the trends , but when you have to base an outfit around the same pair of shoes , it ’s not easy			1
‘ i do n’t know what i ’ll do when they finally give in - i guess i ’ll have to plan another trip to the shop in @entity16			0
last time i went , when i was 13 - years - old , i was a size 13 , but my feet have grown so i ’ve stretched the shoes			2
‘ the shop only stocks up to a size 13 , but the shoemaker says he can make footwear especially for me in a size 14			0
he ’s my only hope			0
