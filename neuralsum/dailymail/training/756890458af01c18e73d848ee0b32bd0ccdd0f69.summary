three @entity1 supporters voted with their feet on wednesday night with 50,000 empty seats at @entity4 for @entity5 's friendly against @entity6			1
and audience figures would suggest fans staged a protest with their television remote , too			0
while the @entity13 's @entity12 raked in over 8 million viewers , @entity5 's drab performance against @entity6 managed to pull in only half that number			1
indeed just 4.5 million tuned in to watch @entity17 's side record a slender 1 - 0 victory over @entity6			1
in their first game since the @entity35 shambles , where @entity5 â€™s stay at the tournament lasted just two games , the brave 40,000 who turned up at @entity4 would have been hoping for an improved display from @entity5 's alleged new era			1
but they were treated to a largely lifeless performance			0
the @entity44 has accepted that it has work to do to regain supporters ' trust after the disappointment of the @entity35 , and has arranged high - profile friendlies against world champions @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 over the next two years to try to drum up interest , especially with a fairly hum - drum @entity57 qualifying group			0
sitting comfortably : @entity58 is a judge on the hit @entity13 programme which has gained a cult following empty seats : only 40,000 supporters turned up to watch @entity5 face @entity6 in wednesday 's friendly @entity44 general secretary @entity64 said last week : ' we have got some work to do , we have to rebuild a squad which is @entity17 's department , and we have got to rebuild some trust with the supporters			2
' @entity5 played @entity6 with the top tier closed due to low ticket sales - a record low for an @entity5 game at the new @entity4 but the attendance of 40,181 was slightly better than the @entity44 had been fearing			2
the @entity44 says it will be the best part of a decade before it can consider taking @entity5 games to other stadiums around the country as it needs the income from @entity4 to pay off the stadium 's debt .			0

over 8 million *people* tuned in to watch @entity12
