by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor a review into how an @entity4 bomb suspect was wrongly told he was not wanted by police has found two other cases where similar errors were apparently made			1
@entity8 found systematic flaws in the way so - called ‘ comfort letters ’ were sent to almost 200 republican suspected terrorists who were on - the - run			1
critics today claimed it amounted to a ‘ get out of jail free card ’ for @entity17 , who was accused of murdering four soldiers in the @entity4 's @entity20 bombing in 1982			1
@entity21 ordered the review of the scheme after @entity17 ’s trial collapsed after it emerged he had received a letter clearing him to travel to the @entity26			1
in may last year mr @entity17 was arrested at @entity27 and charged with killing squadron quartermaster corporal @entity28 , lieutenant @entity29 , trooper @entity30 and lance corporal @entity31			1
seven horses were also killed in the attack as the soldiers travelled from their barracks to @entity36			2
but the existence of the letter telling him he was not wanted by police meant he walked free from court			0
the peace process plan agreed between @entity44 and @entity47 's @entity46 government saw 190 letters of assurance sent to on - the - runs telling them they were not wanted by @entity26 authorities			1
@entity8 said the scheme was not well publicised , and effectively kept ' below the radar ' , but was not secret			0
' the administrative scheme did not amount to an amnesty , ' she said			0
' suspected terrorists were not handed a ' get out of jail free card '			1
' but shockingly she unearthed details of two more cases where errors were made			0
they included : the @entity17 case triggered a political crisis at @entity64 earlier this year			0
many politicians , particularly unionists , reacted furiously , claiming they knew nothing about the letters			0
@entity70 first minister @entity69 threatened to resign over the matter - an ultimatum he withdrew when mr @entity21 ordered the review			1
a police commander subsequently claimed that 95 of those who received letters were linked , though only by intelligence , to 295 murders during the @entity79			0
today mr @entity69 said the scheme was ‘ wrong in principle and shambolic in practice ’			2
he added : ‘ of course it was a get out of jail free card for @entity17			1
' it has the potential of being a get out of jail card for the two that @entity8 refers to as in error , it has the potential of being a get out of jail free card for the others who were not given the caveat that was entered in some of the personal letters that were sent out			1
‘ and indeed it has the potential of being a get out of out jail free card for anyone who has received a letter because no one knows whether it would amount to an abuse of process application being accepted by a future judge			1
’ @entity106 's most senior police officer said it was ' highly unlikely ' the two other letters sent in error would lead to the collapse of future court cases			2
chief constable @entity111 said he accepted @entity8 's findings and apologised to the @entity20 victims			0
he said : ' the difference though between those is that those errors have been identified and we have taken action around those so that even with those two additional errors mitigation is in place			0
' he added : ' if they ever were to come to court it is highly unlikely that an abuse of process application ( to collapse the case ) would be successful as it was in the @entity17 case because we have identified the mistake and we have done something about it			1
' under the scheme the names of individuals were passed to the government , mostly through @entity44 , before being handed to police and prosecutors to assess their status			2
a report on each individual was sent back to the government and , if they were declared as not being wanted , a letter of assurance was then issued to the individuals			0
in the @entity149 today , @entity106 secretary @entity148 said : ' i know that recent events have revived painful memories for those affected by that terrible atrocity ( @entity20 ) and i apologise again on behalf of this government for any hurt that has caused			2
' she added : ' i fully accept the @entity159 's conclusions and recommendations and am determined that the government will act on them			0
' but , as i have said before , as far as this government is concerned , the @entity164 scheme is over			0
' for more than 30 years , @entity17 had the @entity4 bombing in @entity20 hanging over his head - and the families of four victims denied justice .			2

@entity46 government did deal with @entity44 as part of the peace process
190 ' comfort letters ' told on - the - run @entity4 suspects they were not *sought*
@entity8 says flawed scheme was hidden ' under the radar '
first minister @entity69 *condemns* ' get out of jail free card '
the use of an incorrect date of birth to *search* a police *database* may have missed an ****offence**** potentially linked to an individual . an individual with the same name and same year of birth was wanted for a terrorist ****offence**** . it has not yet been established if this was the same individual who received the letter of assurance .
an individual who was wanted for an ****offence**** committed after the 1998 good **friday** peace accord was sent a letter with a general assurance they were not wanted . the origin of the mistake lay in the fact the police *believed* they were only *search*ing for pre- 1998 ****offence****s and therefore did not outline details of the 2003 ****offence**** when *informing* the @entity213 that the individual was ' not wanted by the @entity215 ' .
may 21 , 1974 - @entity17 , then *22* , is *convicted* in @entity217 of **members*hip* of the @entity4 .

1983 - @entity17 is identified as the suspect and an arrest *****warrant***** is issued over the bombing .
**october** 21 , 1984 - the @entity246 publishes @entity17 's *picture* and alleges he is wanted over the bombing . meanwhile , @entity249 *prepares* to seek his ***extradition*** largely based on *fingerprint* evidence on *parking* *tickets* .
1985 - 1987 - the @entity246 publishes three more articles repeating that @entity17 is wanted by police .
*november* 21 , 1989 - the then ***attorney*** general *sir* @entity*25*7 considers @entity17 's case and decides the finger print evidence is not *compelling* enough to seek ***extradition*** .
june 1991 - a review by @entity249 backs up the decision not to seek ***extradition*** .
1993 - @entity249 decide : ‘ the subject is not *extraditable* but is obviously arrestable should he be detained within the @entity26 *jurisdiction* ***...*** ’
*august* 29 , 1994 - the *****warrant***** for @entity17 's arrest is *accidentally* removed .
**october** 31 , 1994 - when the error is *spotted* the *****warrant***** is *recirculated* .

2001 - the @entity26 makes a *commitment* not to *pursue* those who might benefit from early release schemes .
july 20 , 2007 - @entity17 , *62* , of @entity296 , receives a ‘ letter of assurance ’ that he is not wanted in @entity106 or the @entity26 when in fact there is an *outstanding* *****warrant***** against him in the @entity26 . the letter is sent by the @entity215 ( @entity215 ) on behalf of the secretary of state for @entity106 and the ***attorney*** general . the letter *reassures* @entity17 that he can visit his son and *grandchild* in @entity307 . he also travels several times to the @entity26 and @entity106 .
2008 - a chain of emails between two @entity215 officers indicates that the @entity215 knew that @entity17 was wanted over the @entity20 bombing by the @entity314 and that this was not mentioned in the 2007 letter . in the *summer* , before travelling with his wife to @entity307 , @entity17 contacts the @entity307 authorities for a *temporary* *residence* permit . he says : ‘ the reason for the above application is that i served a term of *imprisonment* in @entity3*25* in the @entity326 in 1974 ***...*** i was named in some @entity26 *newspapers* as being *responsible* for the @entity20 *&* @entity329 bombings in 1982 , which i *strenuously* deny . no *****warrant***** was ever issued by the @entity26 authorities to have me *extradited* and i *understand* from contacts which have taken place between @entity26 and @entity44 that they , the @entity26 , have no further interest in me . i have *strongly* supported the peace process from the very beginning of the talks and i believe that the only way forward for all *people* on the *island* of @entity106 north and south is in peaceful *co-operation* and *mutual* *respect* and *understand*ing for each other ***...*** ’ the application is granted .
2009 - @entity17 visits @entity347 and @entity348 in his role to *promote* greater *understand*ing between @entity352 and @entity353 ex **prisoners** .

may 19 , 2013 - @entity17 is arrested at @entity27 en route to @entity361 . he *allegedly* told police : ‘ i am *surprised* that this had come up as i have travelled in and out of the @entity26 on a number of *occasions* to see family and i have travelled to @entity307 from @entity217 . when i went to @entity307 i contact the @entity26 government to check it would be ok as i did *n't* want any *problems* . they said that would be fine . ’ he is subsequently charged over the murder of four @entity26 soldiers and causing an **explosion** .
*january* 2014 - a trial date is listed at the @entity376 before mr @entity377 . instead , @entity17 's *defence* team launch an 11th hour bid for the case to be thrown out *due* to an ‘ abuse of process ’ .
**february** 2014 - trial judge @entity383 throws out the case because of the @entity215 error in sending the letter and not *correcting* the false impression it gives @entity17 . the final ruling was handed down on **friday** **february** 21 but could not be reported until the prosecution had decided in *discussion* with the ***attorney*** general not to appeal .
