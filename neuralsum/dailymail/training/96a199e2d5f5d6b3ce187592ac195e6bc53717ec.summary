by @entity0 @entity1 are going ahead with plans to table a £ 55million bid for @entity6 stars @entity7 and @entity8			1
@entity9 understands that @entity1 have identified their primary transfer targets and the strategy will not be affected by @entity13 ’s departure or the search for his replacement			2
talks to bring in @entity17 left back @entity8 , 18 , are at an advanced stage , with @entity1 confident of sealing a £ 30m deal			1
twin targets : @entity1 propose to wrap up the signings of @entity8 ( left ) and @entity7 on the move ? @entity1 will offer a fee of £ 55m for the @entity17 duo and they are offering another £ 25m for his @entity6 team - mate @entity7 , who has forced himself into @entity28 contention after emerging as one of the most exciting @entity31 midfielders in the @entity32 this season			1
the fee includes add - ons relating to the progress both players make for club and country , as well as a bonus payment to @entity42 club @entity41 where @entity7 , 25 , started his youth career			1
it is believed @entity1 are on course to complete a double deal with @entity6 before the @entity28			1
the deposed @entity32 champions are keen to do their transfer business as early as possible and avoid a repeat of last summer when they chased high - profile targets @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 , only to make a solitary signing in @entity56			1
top target : @entity54 ( front ) is wanted by the @entity60 hierarchy @entity61 midfielder @entity54 remains high on @entity1 ’s hit - list and they are still confident of signing @entity64 ’s £ 60m - rated striker @entity63 as part of a £ 200m rebuilding programme			1
@entity60 chief @entity67 will also have to move quickly if he wants to install @entity68 as @entity13 ’s successor before the @entity71 coach is a firm favourite for the job but will be occupied with international commitments from may 7			2
@entity1 ’s interim boss @entity75 has been put in charge for the final four games of the season and will try to restore the ethos that worked under sir @entity80			2
that even extends to his first press conference , with @entity75 changing it back to the same 9.30 time slot and venue favoured by @entity80			0
old times : @entity75 ( right ) has moved them back to the same time and place as sir @entity80 the @entity1 veteran will be assisted by his old team - mates @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 in his first game at home to @entity98 tomorrow , and @entity93 admitted : ‘ to be there together is a bit of a surreal thing			1
we walked in here together when we were 12			0
‘ i ’m not 40 yet but @entity75 is , and myself and @entity94 are nearly there			0
so for us and @entity95 to be there together is a very proud moment			0
saturday is a massive occasion , not only for @entity75 , but for the staff , the fans and the players because they know we ’ve underachieved			0
’ meanwhile , it has emerged @entity75 tried to steer @entity13 away from trouble even as the @entity1 manager ’s doomed reign entered its final throes			0
hard line : @entity13 fined @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 for a late night out ... but @entity75 did not agree the 40 - year - old made a plea to the @entity121 to show leniency to @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity116 after they were photographed on a late night out in @entity123 following @entity1 ’s @entity125 defeat by @entity126			2
@entity13 fined his three @entity17 players and ordered them to do extra training last week			0
@entity75 knew the disciplinary action had gone down badly among the @entity1 players and tried to convince @entity13 it was unwise			0
his plea went unheeded although it is unclear if the fines will remain in place now @entity75 has been put in charge .			0
