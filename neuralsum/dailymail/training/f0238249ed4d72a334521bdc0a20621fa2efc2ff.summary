we 've all heard of mobile homes , but how about a mobile island ? one designer has put forward a plan for the ultimate yacht accessory - a roll out platform that serves as a private spot in the middle of the ocean			1
measuring some 33ft by 26ft when deployed , @entity11 's design concept is a folding , floating platform , which can be stored in the tender bay of a large yacht and opened out when needed			1
the pop - up island offers excellent facilities that can give you a closer feeling of being on the sea than on a large boat measuring some 33ft x 26ft when deployed , @entity11 's design concept is a folding , floating platform , which in its folded position can be stored in a tender bay of a large yacht @entity11 came up with the design during his final year of his @entity29 degree at the @entity30 deployed using standard overhead tender cranes it can be towed by tender in its folded position to a preferred location â€“ either into a shallow bay that the yacht can not access , or simply to act as a stern extension to the yacht 's existing transom platform , thereby offering a large and flexible space for recreation , dining and relaxing			1
an option to configure the island for use as a portable helicopter landing platform is also being investigated , with such a feature allowing existing yachts with no landing facilities , or new designs to have a flexible facility on board , without the need to sacrifice valuable deck space			1
@entity11 is a recent graduate of @entity29 and the concept was initiated as part of a final year project			2
the talented designer told @entity59 : ' we see many potential applications and whilst we continue to technically develop the design further , we are actively seeking a manufacturer who is interested in investing in the development of the product and bringing it to market			2
' @entity69 started life as my final year project at the @entity30			0
i wanted to design an innovative superyacht accessory so began by researching what was being offered by the industry as a whole			2
an option to configure the island for use as a portable helicopter landing platform is also being investigated ' i soon released that while superyacht guests were able to enjoy spending time on these impressive 265ft vessels , they were not actually connected to the splendour of the sea , being many decks above the waterline			1
as for visiting beautiful secluded bays , these vessels were also too big to moor up close and let guests enjoy the surroundings			0
' i therefore thought to myself ' what if there was a way of launching a floating island that guests could spend the day on with everything they required on board ? ' the @entity99 was then born as a versatile platform design that allows guests to create memorable experiences from a safe , private base			1
' @entity105 @entity104 , a subsidiary of the @entity107 , is working with @entity108 in the development of the project			0
recognising the creativity of @entity112 , @entity105 has invested in the undertaking of technical studies to assess technical feasibility and engineer the design further			0
the floating island can be folded back up and placed back into the holding bay of the yacht , offering a separate luxury ' this project is a perfect match for @entity105 @entity104 ' , said yacht design director @entity123			1
' we recognise that creativity drives innovation and it is encouraging to see young designers such as @entity11 initiating ideas such as the @entity99			2
we are strong believers in recognising that the creation and development of new ideas is best accomplished in a collaborative manner - bringing together unique capabilities to achieve the optimum result			0
' the team are also investigating the possibility of applying the @entity99 into the hotel industry , as well as the military and events sectors			0
after @entity11 's graduation he took the design work to the @entity142 in september 2011 where he met bmt @entity104 , an industry leading independent yacht design consultancy based in @entity145			1
they were excited by the concept and offered to collaborate and assess the technical feasibility of the @entity99			0
the partners are now working to make the project to reality .			0

measuring some 33ft x 26ft when deployed , @entity11 's design concept is a folding , floating platform
in its folded position it can be stored in a tender bay of a large yacht , and offers *opportunity* to be closer to the sea
option to configure the island for use as a portable helicopter landing platform is also being investigated
