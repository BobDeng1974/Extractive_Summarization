by @entity0 recharging your batteries while shopping or sightseeing will soon involve more than just getting a latte , and a comfortable seat			0
@entity7 has announced it will be offering wireless mats for customers to power their mobile phones while they sip on their mocha			1
the global coffee chain has teamed up with @entity13 to begin the @entity15 rollout across 7,500 @entity7 and @entity17 shops			1
the global coffee chain has teamed up with @entity13 to begin a @entity15 rollout of wireless phone chargers in @entity7 and @entity17 shops the technology is described as ‘ inductive charging ’ because it uses magnetic induction			1
the current coming from the power outlet moves through the wire in the charger , creating a magnetic field			0
the magnetic field then generates a current in the coil inside the device , which is connected to the battery to charge a mobile phone			2
to use the system , customers must have a mobile with built - in wireless charging , or a phone accessory that provides the same capabilities			1
these can be brought for around £ 15 in the @entity44 and $ 25 in the @entity15 chains in the @entity46 will be the first to get the technology , which allows customers to charge their mobiles on designated table areas			1

according to @entity7 , over the next three years , more than 100,000 table chargers will be installed in @entity7 ' 7,500 company - owned stores in the @entity15 the group has yet to reveal plans about a global rollout , or whether the technology will also be brought to the @entity44			1
according to @entity7 , over the next three years , more than 100,000 table chargers will be installed in @entity7 ' 7,500 company - owned stores in the @entity15 ( pictured ) ‘ @entity84 in @entity7 are the result of almost a decade of scientific research spanning material sciences , magnetic induction and mesh networking , ’ said @entity82 , chief executive of @entity83			1
‘ the two - pronged power - plug dates back to the era of the horse drawn carriage , so that today ’s announcement marks the first meaningful upgrade to the way we access power in well over a century			0
’ the typical customer will probably use the wireless re-charger for about 15 minutes , @entity7 predicts			0
the group is also planning to pilot a programme later this year that will let customers order ahead via mobile apps			1
it could mean the end of the daily hunt for power cables			0
@entity110 researchers have unveiled an experimental wireless recharging system that could top up the mobile of everyone in the office wirelessly			2
the system can transmit power up to 16 ft ( five metres ) , and charge up to 40 phones at a time			0
it is even powerful enough to power a tv			0
called the ' @entity121 ' , it is believed to be the longest range wireless power system developed so far			2
' the way electronic devices receive their power has changed tremendously over the past few decades , from wired to non-wired , ' the researchers say			0
' users today enjoy all kinds of wireless electronic gadgets including cell phones , mobile displays , tablet pcs , and even batteries			2
@entity134 , a professor of @entity135 at @entity136 in @entity137 , said the system could also power larger items			0
' with @entity121 a large led tv as well as three 40 w - fans can be powered from a 5 - meter distance			0
' the distance is a record for wireless technology			0
current phone systems , for example , require the user to place their phone on a charging ' pad - such as the one being introduced to @entity7 stores			2
with the new system , they would never need to remove it from their bag or pocket			0
@entity110 researchers have unveiled an experimental wireless recharging system that could top up the mobile of everyone in the office			2

chains in @entity46 will be the first to get the technology
to use the system , customers must have a mobile with wireless charging built - in , or a *separate* phone accessory that provides the same capabilities
more than 100,000 table chargers will be installed in 7,500 @entity15 shops
a global roll out of the technology has yet to be *confirmed* by the group
