@entity0 returned to @entity1 today for what is being billed as a new version of the long - running show			1
but apparently the cantankerous comedienne is up to her old tricks behind the scenes			0
sources at @entity1 tell @entity9 that @entity0 has already become a terror , only allowing the three new executive producers and co-hosts ; @entity13 and newcomers @entity14 and @entity16 , to communicate with her and making it clear to everyone in earshot , she 's literally running the show			1
' she was at @entity1 for several days last week , meeting with producers and telling them " how things are going to go "			2
love you , mean it ? newbies @entity0 , @entity14 and @entity16 put their hands together for returning @entity13			1
but show insiders say @entity0 wants to rule the roost as moderator toeing the line : @entity0 was sure to get a pedicure , fearing her unkempt feet might draw attention from the show as she recovers from some sciatica			1
the first day of @entity1 's new host lineup saw the return of the cantankerous former emcee after an eight - year absence two @entity50 ! @entity0 is back after a contentious exit and several years absence and she 's brought another @entity53 with her - actress and activist @entity14 last wednesday , @entity0 and new co-host @entity55 did a test show with two fill - in hosts in an effort to build chemistry			1
neither @entity14 or @entity13 were present			2
despite the fact that @entity13 is the regular moderator for the show , leading the discussion , @entity0 took charge of the test show with @entity55			1
' it was almost as though she was rehearsing for when she eventually takes over as moderator			0
it 's clear that she would have preferred being in that capacity as she was before , ' offered our source			0
@entity0 joined @entity1 in 2006 , replacing @entity70			1
but the following year @entity0 and @entity71 had a heated exchange that got so intense producers cut to a split screen , something that @entity0 despised			0
she walked off the set that day and never returned to the show			0
but @entity13 was clear after @entity0 complained several times in recent days : ' i 'm moderating and that 's how it 's going to be , so work with me babe ! ' ' @entity0 actually said aloud , " this is taking forever ! i know we 're on tape , but should it take 4 hours ? " pulling her weight : all the ladies on the panel were fascinated as former @entity90 staffer turned @entity92 wrangler recalled her days in the controversial @entity93 and ill - fated @entity95 campaign trail ' no one responds when she makes snarky comments except @entity13 , because everyone else fears for their job , ' detailed the source			1
the sentiment backstage after the test show was that the four co-hosts were ' boring together ' and they were going to have to find some excitement before today 's show			1
but other than barefoot @entity0 rubbing her tired tootsies , the magic was n't there			2
@entity111 called @entity1 's tribute to @entity113 ' the worst ever			2
' ' i can hear @entity113 going , " ugh ! " over and over in her grave in response to this treacly tribute from @entity118 on today 's episode of @entity1 , wrote @entity120			1
' based on what happened in the test show , the only company that 'll be sponsoring this show after next week will be @entity125 and any other brand targeting senior citizens			1
there 's nothing magical about the chemistry with these four and the show just feels older , ' the source added			0
@entity14 apparently seemed overwhelmed by her experience at the tape shows and had this look of as though she was second - guessing her decision to sign on			0
@entity13 continues to make jokes about how she ca n't wait until her contract is up and ' i wish @entity140 would just pay me to go home ! ' in the end , it is clear that returning to @entity1 was @entity0 's redemption for how things ended first time after her unceremonious exit after an on - air spat with @entity71			1
appearing for the first time on the panel today was token blonde @entity16 , who conservative credentials beat even @entity90 - loving @entity71 since @entity151 actually worked for @entity90 and in the third corner , the wildcard : known for her voice as much as for her no - holds - barred @entity155 attitude - actress @entity14			0
@entity157 gave her blessing : the queen herself made an appearance as the ladies of her show held court and each kissed her hand but do n't expect too many screaming matches or claims that the world is flat ( here 's looking at you @entity171 ) : @entity0 says the new view will be smarter , calmer and an all - around better show			1
the live show began calmly , with introductions and a nod to creator and news media queen @entity177 , who held court from a throne and had her hand kissed by each of the hostesses , including the only one remaining from the previous season , @entity13			1
' welcome to the newer view , ' joked @entity13 , before introducing @entity0			1
@entity0 kicked things off by catching up with viewers , including a discussion of her heartache and the gastric bypass surgery that followed			0
up next , an introduction of the other @entity0 -- actress @entity14 , who plugged her upcoming @entity191 show and memoir			2
then came @entity16 : former @entity90 press secretary for six years			0
' i am a @entity194 , i should get that out of the way , ' she said through a smile to audience uproar on both sides of the aisle			0
before things got too out of control , fiery liberal @entity0 piped in : ' and i like her , i swear ! ' true to form , though , the group jumped right into a contentious topic -- the @entity206 domestic abuse saga and further questions over child and sex abuse			0
' all about money , all about the brand being jeopardized , ' politico @entity151 chimed in first on the @entity206 issue			0
@entity214 agreed there 's no excuse for hitting women , used her sports hero , convicted abuser @entity220 , to make the point that one 's environment could be at fault as much as the individual			0
' [ @entity226 ] respond the way you were taught , ' said the actress			0
but should one continue to support the likes of @entity220 and @entity206 by paying for event tickets ? @entity0 did n't think so			2
' i have n't seen a @entity234 movie since the allegations came out , ' @entity0 said , moving the conversation along to her own struggles with abuse			2
though she did say she continues to appreciate @entity239 as an artist , despite his violent past			0
' @entity0 ! ' replied the contestant			0
' wrong , ' @entity0 bellowed to the young lady 's chagrin			2
@entity245 : a new segment gave the ladies and their viewers some time to catch up and get to know the panel -- for instance : @entity151 hates @entity251 , @entity0 had a gastric bypass , @entity214 has a forthcoming memoir , and @entity13 , well , she 's been enjoying her shoes another new segment came in the form of an audience participation game called @entity0 or @entity0 ? where contestants must decide which @entity0 is being described on a card loss but a win : while this episode 's contestant lost @entity0 or @entity0 ? with only one correct answer , the game did reveal a little known and astonishing fact about @entity214 -- she practices tae kwon do ! @entity214 and @entity0 introduced a new audience participation game they will play each day together , a play on their identical names called @entity0 or @entity0 ? in the game , the audience members try to win a prize by deciding which @entity0 does the thing being described on a card			1
the show concluded with the tribute to rivers that began with a song in the comedienne 's honor by @entity191 diva @entity118			0
sour note : ' i can hear @entity113 going , " ugh ! " over and over in her grave in response to this treacly tribute from @entity118 on today 's episode of @entity1 , wrote @entity120			1

even before @entity1 *debuted* today , @entity0 was letting everyone know she 's top dog
@entity13 's back as moderator , and all three ladies bowed to the queen at the start of the show
but behind the scenes that does n't *sit* well with @entity0
last week @entity13 told her , ' i 'm moderating and that 's how it 's going to be , so work with me babe ! '
@entity0 promises a lot more smart talk and a lot less *squabbling*
' based on what happened in the test show , the only company that 'll be sponsoring this show after next week will be @entity125 , ' says one insider
