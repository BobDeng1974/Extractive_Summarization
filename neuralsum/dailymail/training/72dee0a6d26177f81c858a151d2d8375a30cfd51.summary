by @entity0 published : 08:34 est , 31 july 2012 updated : 01:49 est , 1 august 2012 police have confirmed that the 999 call from a three - year - old girl to report her mother had fallen and was not moving was a hoax			1
detectives investigating a 999 call to the ambulance service which claimed to be a three - year - old girl called ' @entity10 ' reporting her mother collapsed at home have now established the call was made by two ten - year - old girls			1
unusually the number that made the call was not identifiable and could not initially be traced , prompting a frantic search for vulnerable ' @entity10 '			2
urgent appeal below urgent : dr @entity18 , from @entity19 and @entity20 , detective chief inspector , of the @entity22 and @entity23 were urgently looking for ' @entity10 ' a team of detectives from @entity26 and @entity23 , made wide - ranging inquiries to trace the family , including checks on police systems , hospitals , and the public register of births			1
today the mobile phone number was traced to a @entity36 address where two ten - year - old girls living there were identified and have been spoken to by officers this afternoon			1
officers are now liaising with the girls ’ parents and partner agencies to take appropriate action			0
they have not been arrested			0
detective chief inspector @entity20 , of the homicide and @entity23 , said : ' we are pleased that our investigation has shown that we do n’t have a vulnerable little girl out there with her mum collapsed beside her , although it is obviously incredibly frustrating that this has turned out to be a hoax			2
' we treated the call as genuine on the basis of what was said what could be established in the initial stages of the investigation			0
the girls had told the operator the girl 's name as ' @entity10 ' and her mother was called @entity64			1
search : the little girl clearly said that she lived in @entity67 ' @entity10 ' said her house number was 23 and had ' court ' in the street name and said she lived in @entity67 and her grandparents lived in @entity36 , @entity72			2
during the call , which lasted 33 minutes , ' @entity10 ' told the call - handler that she was nearly four years old and that her mother had fallen over and would not get up			1
she said she had shouted at her mother and wiggled her but she remained on the kitchen floor with a piece of toast in her hand , not moving			0
' @entity10 ' had worried 999 by saying the front and back door were locked and she could not get out of the house , prompting fears she was vulnerable and alone with a sick mother			1
police traced a number of women called @entity64 to eliminate from the inquiry			2
detective chief inspector @entity89 added : ' we are very grateful to the public and the media for all the support they have given us in appealing for information over this incident			0
' our priority is always to help the public and protect life as was our overriding focus in this investigation			0
' this incident again highlights how misuse of the 999 system can cause significant unnecessary work for the emergency services who have limited resources to deal with genuine calls for help from members of the public			0
' we hope it will help to remind people of the serious consequences of misusing the 999 system			0
' @entity114 : who is @entity10 ? the hoax call			1
