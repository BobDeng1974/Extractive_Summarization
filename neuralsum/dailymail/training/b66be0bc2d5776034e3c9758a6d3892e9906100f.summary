@entity1 's decision to release @entity2 could prove costly if the striker does the damage against @entity5 at @entity6 on saturday evening			1
with that in mind , @entity7 have decided to take a trip back down memory lane to identify the players who have made either a good or bad impression on their first appearance for their new side			1
@entity20 was named in a three man attack alongside @entity30 and @entity31 , which on paper looked deadly , but @entity20 could n’t get off to the fairy tale start he desired			1
instead @entity20 struggled to get into the game and saw his only effort fly high and wide , before he was replaced by @entity37 on 66 minutes , met by cheers from the travelling contingent who taunted their former hero			1
bad start : @entity20 , who looks set to join @entity43 , failed to impress against @entity22 @entity44 – @entity46 debut @entity47 1 vs 2 @entity46 ( 10th august 1997 ) it was mixed emotions for @entity44 on his @entity46 debut as despite getting off to a winning start , he missed a penalty against his former club			2
@entity44 was jeered throughout by the home fans , but he missed his chance to silence the @entity57 faithful when he saw his penalty cannon back off the post , leaving the score at 0 - 0			2
two second half @entity46 goals saved @entity44 ’s blushes , but it is a moment he will not look back on fondly , and not the way he would have liked to start his @entity46 career			2
penalty miss : @entity44 failed to score from the spot on his first game for @entity46 @entity71 – @entity73 debut @entity74 1 vs 2 @entity73 ( 10th august 2014 ) @entity71 spent over five years at @entity74 and despite mainly being used as a second choice goalkeeper throughout his time at @entity78 , he relished his debut against his former club			2
this joy was short lived however , as after 67 minutes the 36 - year - old was left concussed after a clash of heads with his new team - mate and was rushed to hospital			2
not the way he would have envisaged his @entity73 debut , but nevertheless his new side grabbed a last gasp winner earning the three points			0
nightmare debut : former @entity71 goalkeeper @entity71 left the field with concussion on his debut debuts to remember @entity97 – @entity98 home debut @entity98 4 vs 2 @entity22 ( 19th september 1992 ) @entity97 became @entity98 ’s record signing in a £ 2.5million deal , and he made his home debut against @entity22 , the side that had broken the @entity104 transfer record to sign him the year before			1
in a game that is remembered for @entity108 ’s famous open goal miss , @entity97 also grabbed some headlines himself with two goals against his former employers			0
this was a bitter pill to swallow for @entity22 fans , as the man who had struggled to make an impression for the reds , tore them apart on his @entity98 debut			0
two - goal hero : @entity97 managed to get himself on the scoresheet against former side @entity22 @entity121 – @entity122 debut @entity122 3 vs 0 @entity124 ( 21st september 2013 ) @entity121 ’s @entity122 debut was delayed due to his failure to obtain a work permit any earlier , which set up a fiery debut against his former club @entity124			0
@entity130 criticised @entity121 ’s attitude in the build up to the game , but this only served to fire up the @entity135 international who came back to haunt the @entity137 by taking the lead for his new side 20 minutes in			1
his sale was not popular amongst @entity124 fans who gave @entity121 a large ovation when his name was read out , and the new @entity122 man responded by refusing to celebrate against his former club			0
silencing the critics : @entity121 done his talking on the pitch by giving his side the lead @entity151 – @entity152 debut @entity152 2 vs 1 @entity154 ( 28th january 2009 ) @entity151 marked his £ 14million move to @entity156 with a winning goal on his debut against former side @entity154			1
@entity159 spent four years on @entity160 where he netted 42 times , but he came back to haunt his former club with an impressive display and a decisive goal as he started a new chapter at his 8th new club			1
match winner : @entity151 scored for @entity152 against @entity154 in the citizens ' 2 - 1 win @entity170 – @entity172 debut @entity172 1 vs 0 @entity22 ( 13th february 1999 ) @entity170 enjoyed a successful 10 year spell at @entity22 and there were no hard feelings when he pulled on a @entity172 shirt to make his debut against his former team			0
instead this gave @entity170 , who came on as a second half substitute , the chance of one more farewell to the travelling @entity22 support			0
it was n’t only a testimonial game for @entity170 though as his new side ran out 1 - 0 winners in a rare win for them in a season which saw them relegated			0
surprise victory : @entity170 helped @entity172 claim a shock win against former side @entity22 @entity194 , @entity22 2 vs 1 @entity195 2014 @entity196 , @entity22 1 vs 1 @entity124 2011 @entity197 , @entity198 0 vs 0 @entity154 2011 @entity199 , @entity122 2 vs 2 @entity124 2014 @entity200 , @entity124 1 vs 0 @entity22 2009 @entity202 goal @entity203 , @entity204 0 vs 2 @entity205 2014 @entity206 , @entity47 2 vs 1 @entity22 , 2009			0

@entity2 and @entity208 could haunt former boss @entity1
@entity1 decided to sell @entity208 to @entity17 for £ *25million* in july
@entity17 signed @entity2 on a free transfer following his release from @entity5
