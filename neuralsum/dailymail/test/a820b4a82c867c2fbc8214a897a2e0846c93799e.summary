@entity0 must decide whether to stick with the attack that failed to force a first @entity3 win or twist and freshen things up for a second match that is already upon them			1
the sight of @entity9 and @entity10 impressing in the nets here on sunday , and @entity13 bowling apparently without discomfort after joining the squad , was a reminder that @entity0 have options for the second test which starts on tuesday			1
it would be harsh to blame the bowlers for their inability to take the eight wickets they needed on the final day of the @entity3 because they threw everything at @entity25 on a pitch that refused to deteriorate			0
@entity9 , pictured with @entity27 , is pushing for a place in @entity0 's attack for the second test @entity10 ( pictured ) and @entity9 impressed in the nets on sunday ahead of the second match of the series yet there is no doubting that they were missing an x-factor , with strike bowlers @entity37 and @entity39 down on pace and @entity0 refusing to gamble on the inconsistent leg - spin of @entity42			1
@entity27 was the fastest bowler in the first test , clocked at 91mph , and while it would be a huge surprise if @entity0 dropped either @entity37 or @entity39 , there is a case for @entity9 or the impressive @entity10 to feature			1
‘ over the next 12 months we are going to need a squad of bowlers who can win us test matches , ’ said vice-captain @entity47 after @entity0 ’s first look at the @entity53 here			2
‘ both @entity10 and @entity9 are bowling with really good pace and that ’s important with so many @entity3 matches to come			2
’ @entity13 has joined up with the @entity0 squad after missing the first test in @entity58 through injury @entity60 provides an option for the @entity0 selectors while @entity63 appeared in good spirits on sunday if @entity65 convinces @entity0 he is fully fit after recovering from a side injury he will probably replace @entity67 , who took five wickets in the first test but is now nursing a shoulder injury			1
that would add even more depth to an @entity0 middle order who all contributed in @entity58 , with either @entity65 , @entity74 or @entity75 batting as low as eight on the spice island			2
meanwhile , forme @entity79 captain @entity78 has urged the @entity81 to end the ‘ circus ’ surrounding @entity84 ’s potential @entity0 recall			0
@entity78 said @entity84 , who was dismissed for 19 in @entity86 ’s first innings against @entity87 yesterday , is ‘ no longer a great player ’ and does not deserve to play in this summer ’s @entity89 series			0
‘ it ’s all chaotic , ’ said @entity78			0
‘ the @entity81 have got to clear it up			0
just make the decision and stop messing around because you ’re creating a circus which is distracting everybody else			0

@entity9 and @entity10 both impressed in the nets on sunday
@entity13 is also appearing to bowl without discomfort after joining squad
@entity0 were missing an x-factor as the first test *fizzled* out in a draw
and selectors must decide whether to freshen things up for second match
