faced with a shortage of nuts and seeds in the wild , grey squirrels are piling into gardens and pinching food left out for birds			1
with numbers up a third on recent years and expected to grow as the winter bites , the @entity15 has produced a list of tips for bird lovers concerned that there will be enough food to go around			2
helping hand : animal lovers fear competition for food will be fierce this winter advice ranges from coating food with chilli powder , which is disliked by squirrels but palatable to birds , to greasing poles that bird feeders are hung on			1
the influx of squirrels has been blamed on the topsy - turvy weather reducing yields of nuts and seeds in the wild			1
plus , in some trees , such as the beech , nut production follows a cycle and this year marks a natural low point			0
short of nuts and seeds to eat now and to squirrel away for the winter , the animals are trying their luck on already - busy bird tables and nut - filled feeders			1
@entity53 , of the @entity15 , said : ‘ expect some fireworks at garden feeders this autumn and winter			2
bird lovers recommend covering bird food in chilli powder , because squirrels do not like the taste of it ‘ large numbers of birds are already gathering , with species such as the chaffinch and starling being joined by their continental cousins			1
‘ with more grey squirrels than normal also on the scene , competition may be intense			2
‘ unlike many other small mammals , grey squirrels do not hibernate and so they will be looking for food throughout the winter			2
’ dr @entity53 has a range of tips for bird lovers who want to keep squirrels at bay			1
for instance , feeders can be covered with guards which only allow small birds access			0
it may also be possible to keep squirrels away from bird tables by creating a separate feeding area for them , complete with tempting treats			1
more unusual solutions including using something like @entity95 to grease the poles that squirrels shimmy up to reach nut and seed - filled feeders			1
for this to work , the feeders must of course , also be out of jumping distance			0
another option is to coat bird food in chilli powder			0
while it is distasteful to squirrels , birds find it perfectly palatable			2
dr @entity53 said : ‘ it is thought that squirrel ’s taste receptors are like our own and so they feel the heat of the chilli and are put off by that			0
‘ but birds just behave perfectly normally			0
’ he added that like cats , public opinion is divided on the benefits of having squirrels visit gardens			0
‘ people have quite strong feelings			0
they are one of these creatures that some people love having come into the garden and other people do n’t like quite so much			0
‘ where people want to attract them , they can do that and hopefully still provide for the birds .			0

the animals are raiding bird tables and feeders as they *struggle* to find nuts of their own
experts recommend ' greasing poles with @entity95 ' so squirrels can not grip to reach the top
