by @entity0 and @entity1 if you packed a cardigan for a day out yesterday , you might be able to leave it behind today			2
temperatures are forecast to peak at a rather warm @entity6 ( @entity7 ) , right on cue for @entity9 monday			1
yesterday glorious sunshine sent the average @entity12 temperature creeping up from a cool @entity14 ( @entity13 ) earlier in the week to @entity15 ( 64f ) in many parts of the country , including @entity18 , while @entity19 enjoyed highs of @entity21 ( 61f )			1
families flocked to the coast in @entity24 and @entity25 , while roads were gridlocked in @entity27 , @entity28 , as day trippers made their way home from the seaside resort			1
the 27 - year - old lapped up the sunshine on @entity37 in @entity38 figures from @entity50 suggested the sunshine inspired a wave of impromptu barbecues , with sales of sausages and equipment expected to triple those of april			2
the fine weather was not evenly spread , however , according to a forecaster from the @entity60			1
' large swathes of @entity63 , @entity64 and southern parts of @entity66 had good spells of sunshine but further north and west there was thicker cloud producing outbreaks of rain , ' he said			1
' today there is likely to be an east / west split with the best sunshine in the south - eastern parts of @entity63 from @entity78 up to @entity79 , and temperatures will reach 20 or @entity81 ( 68 - 70f )			2
' outbreaks of rain from the west to the east are expected to arrive in the evening and could carry on into tuesday			2
yesterday , with no work till tuesday and clear blue skies and temperatures nudging the mid teens in the @entity92 and @entity93 , children and adults were out playing in the parks and flocking to the coasts			1
a cavalcade of narrow boats descended on the @entity98 in @entity99 , @entity78 to make the most of the weather dozens of boats lined the waterways , bearing bright bunting as passers - by stopped to enjoy the spectacle but it was n't quite yet warm enough for serious sunbathing and , although there were ice creams aplenty , many were still taking precautions with hats and jackets			1
in @entity116 , @entity117 , children were out playing by the sea , building sandcastles and dipping their toes into the still chilly waters despite a stiff breeze			1
bursts of colour blanketed @entity125 , meanwhile , as powdery blue carpets of bluebells shone in almost celestial light of the glorious early morning sun. photographer @entity131 snapped the plants , which have been voted @entity12 's favourite , in two locations near his home in the county			1
' i was fortunate to stumble across some bluebells outside of @entity139 by accident , ' he said			2
' they inspired me to find more and i visited the @entity142 a week late and found this beautiful carpet of flowers			2
' i love how the almost unnatural blue stands out against the woodland green			0
' boaters enjoyed winding their way along the @entity98 and through north @entity78 @entity150 's @entity149 bask in the sunshine , as dozens flock to the pretty city centre spot to make the most of the warm weather ' i love how the almost unnatural blue stands out against the woodland green			1
' : @entity131 photographed these bluebells in bloom near his home in @entity125 a couple take a ride in a kayak , enjoying meandering along the @entity40 in @entity41 but the change in weather , while almost universally welcome , has come with warnings			0
nature lovers have begged holidaymakers not to get too close to huge but harmless basking sharks which are moving close to beaches on the @entity171 coastline			1
the docile monsters of the deep , which can reach 30ft in length and weigh up to eight tonnes , drift round just below the surface with their vast 4ft wide jaws wide open as a net to catch millions of microscopic plankton , their staple food			0
shark fins have been spotted cleaving the water , with this spring 's first sightings close to the shore at @entity185 and near @entity186 in @entity187 , @entity188			0
today wildlife tour operator @entity189 , based in @entity187 , urged excited and curious holidaymakers to take great care when they spot basking shark cruising lazily in shallow water			0
' we 're now getting into the time of year when basking sharks can be found feeding off the @entity188 coast and it 's fantastic to see them , ' said a spokesman			0
' but it 's important to remember that they need to be approached carefully so as not to disturb their natural behaviour			0
' if a shark thrashes its tail and dives or stops feeding and dives , then it is likely you have disturbed it			0
if this happens learn from the mistake and try not to repeat it			0
' @entity216 , three , from @entity217 , enjoys a paddle on @entity116 beach			0
she was joined there @entity221 and @entity222 , two and one respectively , from @entity223 sand between the toes : @entity225 , three , and his sister @entity226 , eight months , enjoy the sun on @entity116 beach in @entity19 people enjoyed an interactive temporary art installation , the @entity231 project in the city centre meanwhile , in @entity41 , university officials have urged students to boycott a notorious annual booze - up today in the city 's @entity236			0
' @entity238 sunday ' attracts thousands of students every year who dress up and play drinking games			0
but locals and visitors have been upset as the historic riverside park has been left littered with rubbish , empty bottles and vomit			0
after years of complaints university officials are calling on students to shun today 's event			0
a @entity253 spokesman said : ' the colleges will be asking students preferably not to attend but if they do to be considerate of others and avoid any behaviour which may cause offence			0
' the three - day forecast : temperatures will increase tomorrow , but a band of rain moving in from the west will gradually cover the country and sit there for the rest of the week but with a fine afternoon and evening expected , it may be difficult to dissuade @entity12 from making the most of the springtime sun. @entity269 , a forecaster with the @entity60 , told @entity270 that for much of @entity63 and @entity64 ' there 's some good weather to be had			1
' although cloud is still overshadowing central and northern parts of the country , many inland areas will enjoy temperatures of up to 15c even as far north as @entity150			1
the best of the sun will be in the @entity280 , particularly around coastal areas , which will nevertheless be slighter cooler under the influence of the sea breeze			2
overnight the clear skies over these areas will lead to a frost and a chilly morning , but @entity288 bank holiday temperatures tomorrow will then increase up to @entity15 in @entity78 and surrounding areas , with much of the rest of the country also enjoying a ' pretty good day '			1
however , rain will start moving into western parts over the course of the day , bringing with it colder temperatures and heavier cloud cover			1
' there 's a little bit of a change coming into western areas , ' said mr @entity269			0
' there is a band of rain coming through			2
' by tuesday , rain will advance across much of the country , with summery weather holding out only in the far west , in an outlook that looks likely to persist for the rest of the week .			1

@entity12 basks in temperatures reaching the *mid-teens* and clear skies across the @entity92 and @entity93
families hit the beaches on bank holiday outings , even as stiff breezes make for lower temperatures by the sea
temperatures are forecast to peak at a rather warm @entity6 ( @entity7 ) , right on cue for @entity43
however rain is forecast to return in the @entity171 and will spread across the country for the rest of the week
