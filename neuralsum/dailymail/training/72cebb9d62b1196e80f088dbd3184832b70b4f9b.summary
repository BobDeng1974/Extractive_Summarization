by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent last updated at 9:13 am on 9th december 2011 @entity3 police have threatened to arrest @entity5 border staff stopping illegal migrants taking @entity8 trains to @entity9			1
dozens of migrants are thought to exploit the so - called ‘ @entity12 ’ every day			2
they buy a @entity8 ticket from @entity14 to @entity12 , allowing them to avoid the @entity5 border checks in the @entity3 capital			1
loophole : passengers can miss key border checks by buying a ticket from @entity14 to @entity12 but then stay on until @entity9 and when the train stops in @entity12 they simply stay on board and carry on through the @entity23 to @entity9 , where passports are rarely checked			1
@entity26 border agency figures suggest use of the loophole has shot up in recent months			2
the @entity3 authorities insist @entity5 can not interrogate @entity8 passengers with tickets to @entity32 because both countries are inside the @entity36 ’s @entity35 area of free movement			2
the government alone is powerless to close the so - called ' @entity12 loophole ' and is in negotiation with other @entity43 countries @entity5 officials were pulled up when they tried to stop two @entity45 men said to ‘ bear all the hallmarks of @entity12 loopholers ’			1
hiding under a @entity8 train is one way of getting into @entity5 – as is trying to sneak into the back of a lorry			0
but both are dangerous and far from certain to succeed – unlike the ‘ @entity12 loophole ’			1
illegal migrants must first buy a ticket – often for as little as £ 23 – from @entity14 in @entity3 to @entity12 in @entity32			1
crucially , this ticket allows them to bypass the @entity5 border controls at the @entity8 terminal in @entity14 , which are designed for those with tickets to @entity9			1
instead the migrants walk down the passport - free lane for @entity12 passengers – where only their ticket is checked			1
when the train gets to @entity12 , they stay on board and complete the journey to @entity9			1
some buy a second ticket covering the final leg of their trip so they do not fall foul of ticket inspectors			2
@entity14 police say stopping passengers with tickets to @entity12 , even those thought to be headed for @entity9 , breaches the @entity35 agreement on free movement			1
one of the @entity5 officials told @entity82 ’s the report that a @entity3 officer shouted at him : ‘ this has got to stop			0
you are not in @entity5 now , you are in @entity35			0
if they make a complaint you will be arrested			0
’ the threats mean @entity5 officials may now have to turn a blind eye to suspected illegal migrants			0
in the first six months of this year , officers caught 80 migrants using the loophole to get into the country			0
but in the following five months that number increased to 240			0
last year just 14 migrants were caught on the route			0
as the figures show only those who are detected by the @entity104 , the true figure is likely to be much higher			0
@entity104 sources said there were fears the loophole could be exploited by terrorists and people traffickers			0
one said it was not unusual to see up to 20 suspect passengers on a @entity8 train			2
another officer even claimed @entity3 police had been known to use the loophole to clear migrants from the streets of @entity14			1
immigration minister @entity119 said : ‘ we are working closely with our @entity3 counterparts and @entity8 to resolve this as quickly as possible			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity3 government did not respond to requests for a comment .			0

passengers buy a train ticket from @entity14 to @entity12 but can stay on until @entity9 without passport checks
alarm first raised in 2001 but nothing was done about it
@entity137 *'s* @entity136 tells *mps* it is ' *unsatisfactory* ' but insists it is not a loophole
