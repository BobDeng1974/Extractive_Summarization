by @entity0 you 've heard about the @entity3 - women working out multiple times per week - but there 's a new breed of gym bunnies giving the likes of fitness fanatic @entity9 a run for her money			1
middle - aged men are forging a new unofficial cult of gym - goers being dubbed @entity16 ( middle aged men in lycra ) , who are becoming obsessed with going to the gym to bulk up			1
this breed of over 40s now represent more than one in ten of the nation ’s bodybuilders and they 're inspired by muscular role models including @entity27 , 45 , @entity28 , 44 , and current ‘ @entity30 ’ actor , 42 - year - old @entity31			1
these so - called @entity48 are taking up bodybuilding partly to battle the onset of middle - aged spread ( 76 per cent ) , but also as a way to improve their long - term health ( 66 per cent )			1
just under a quarter ( 23 per cent ) say they have taken up bodybuilding as a way to improve their performance in other sports			1
the survey also revealed that over a third ( 36 per cent ) of these men take daily work out supplements , such as protein shakes , to maximise the effectiveness of their workout			1
@entity67 : a new survey found that 40 - somethings are the fastest growing age group of people who have taken up bodybuilding in the last 12 months and they want to look like @entity28 , left @entity27 , who will reprise his role as @entity36 in @entity73 , told the june issue of @entity75 about how he prepped before stripping off			1
the 45 - year - old works out all the time , and it seems he upped the ante before showing off his hunky body in all its glory			1
he told them : ‘ it ’s interesting			1
i ’ve been fascinated myself that i do n’t want to completely do nothing			2
this morning , including this [ photoshoot ] , i ’ve trained twice			2
‘ i ’m betting that for the next five or 10 years , i ’ll still get asked to do stuff where i have to be physical			2
it ’s tempting to just go and do yoga , or swim , or play tennis			2
but being skinny , i ’ll lose the muscle like that			2
i know how hard it is to get back			2
’ bulking out : the survey also revealed that over a third of these men take daily work out supplements , such as protein shakes , to maximise the effectiveness of their workout and look like @entity31 ' @entity101 , left @entity27 added : ‘ and by the way , it ’s harder at 45 than it was at 30			1
even now , i ’m noticing the weight starting to go down			2
you have to work hard			1
’ @entity108 , 47 , is also an avid gym goer and lifts weights every week , as well as cycling most places			1
he 's frequently spotted riding , and told @entity75 that he likes to get in about 100 miles a week			2
a spokesperson for @entity114 , who commissioned the survey , said : ' it ’s great to see that men aged 40 and above are not viewing their age as an excuse to slow down , but as an extra motivation to look after their fitness and overall well - being			1
' working out four times a week or more is an excellent way to maintain health , prevent middle age spread and maintain a positive mental attitude			2
' fit over forty : @entity129 , 43 , left in 2014 film @entity131 , and 62 - year - old @entity132 , right , stay fit over forty @entity75 , @entity134 and sports conditioning specialist @entity135 , @entity136 and director of personal training at @entity133 , said : ‘ it ’s brilliant that more and more men over 40 enjoy looking , moving , feeling and performing at their best by exercising regularly			1
the benefits are wide - ranging and unequivocally backed by science			2
here are my top 4 benefits of regular exercise for men over 40			1
' regular exercise increases sexual drive , activity and satisfaction			2
physical endurance and muscle tone improve sexual function and exercise jump - starts the sympathetic nervous system , which increases blood flow down - below to keep your ‘ equipment ’ working properly			0
short bouts of intense exercise increase testosterone , which stimulates sexual desire			0
for example , men over 50 who work out regularly have a 30 per cent lower risk of impotence than those who do n't			1
' plus , most people lose 10 % of their aerobic capacity each year after the age of 30			0
however , men who work out regularly have more energy , strength and endurance than non-exercisers			1
' exercising reduces stress and anxiety by diminishing electrical activity in tense muscles , which makes you less hyperactive and jittery			0
moreover , your body releases endorphins after you work out which boost your mood and promote relaxation			1
' the best reason of all to work out regularly is that it reduces your risk of many serious and potentially deadly diseases , such as heart disease , high blood pressure , osteoporosis , diabetes , obesity , high cholesterol , colon cancer , stroke , heart attack , and arthritis			1
video source @entity196 @entity135 shares his top tips ... @entity135 , @entity136 and director of personal training at @entity199 maintain a @entity200 - as you age , your ability to digest protein gradually declines , requiring a higher protein intake than you needed when you were younger			0
choose the @entity205 - find training movements and / or sports that you can do safely , and ideally , succeed at			0
switch to using a @entity209 for squats and @entity211 or neutral - @entity212 instead of wider grips			0
@entity215 your expectations on your current status and rate of progress , not on what you did ‘ back in the day ’			0
sure , always try to beat last year 's personal records , but what really counts is what you can do currently			0
restore @entity224 bouts of high intensity exercise increase testosterone , which has profound effects on energy , recovery , body composition , and overall mood			0
for the older man , developments in the pharmaceutical field are accelerating at pace here			0
i 'm referring to the increasing use of @entity237 ( @entity237 ) , which is legal , medically supervised , safe , and a lot easier to do than most guys think			0
take counsel from an expert in this field before pursuing this route			0
@entity245 we age , it takes longer to recover from workouts and it also takes longer for injuries to heal			0
instead of thinking , ‘ what else could i do ? ’ think , ‘ will i really benefit from doing this ? ’ make sure that the exercises you choose are safe , effective , and not redundant			0
specialize , but do n't be ‘ @entity257 ’ at anything - as an older exercise enthusiast , you should n't let any physical quality or capacity erode to ‘ bad ’ levels			0
even if you can deadlift 200kg , it is unacceptable to get winded after climbing a few flights of stairs , or to be unable to touch your toes while maintaining a good back position			0
if you allow yourself to think or say anything that ends with ‘ ... for my age ’ , stop			0
do n't miss my point - if you ’re 40 - plus , your body is n't the same as it was in your 20 's			1
it 's most certainly different , but not entirely in a bad way			0
in most respects many can be fitter and more capable than ever			0
prime yourself to train - perform a dynamic mobility warm - up before you train to reduce aches and pains , lengthen typically tight areas and strengthen classically weak areas to prime your body to train			0
use this @entity282 routine ( see video above ) to release tension and restore muscle tissue quality across your entire body			0
then , perform either of these @entity287 routines ( see second and third video ) before your main workout for peak performance .			1
