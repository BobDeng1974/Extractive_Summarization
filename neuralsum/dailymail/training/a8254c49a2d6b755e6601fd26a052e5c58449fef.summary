by @entity1 reporter published : 17:01 est , 2 february 2013 updated : 17:04 est , 2 february 2013 @entity2 , @entity3 , and @entity4 were the most conservative states in @entity6 in 2012			1
in each of the states , between 49 per cent and 50 per cent of residents identified with being conservative			0
meanwhile , people living in the @entity10 were by far the nation 's most liberal , with 41 per cent identifying themselves in that way			1
the annual @entity14 poll found @entity15 was the second most liberal state with 31 per cent of residents , followed by @entity17 , and @entity18 , which were each 29 per cent liberal			2
most conservative : @entity2 , @entity3 , and @entity4 were the most conservative states in @entity6 in 2012 as with most years , the ideological distribution in last year 's poll generally reflected the familiar ' blue state ' and ' red state ' patterns that define the political geography of today 's modern @entity6 , @entity14 said			1
the top 10 conservative states all vote reliably @entity28 in national elections and are all located in the nation 's @entity31 , @entity32 , and @entity33 regions			1
@entity4 and @entity3 were joint second on the list of most conservative states , followed by @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , and @entity44			2
but interestingly , there is n't a perfect correlation between ideology and party as three of the 10 most @entity28 states - @entity51 , @entity52 , and @entity53 - do not rank among the most conservative states			0
similarly , @entity38 , @entity42 , and @entity44 rank in the top 10 most conservative states but not the most @entity28			0
after the top three liberal states comes @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , and @entity62			0
these are all reliably @entity64 voting states and all but @entity18 and @entity10 are on the coast , or - in @entity61 's case - surrounded by the @entity67			2
@entity68 : people living in the @entity10 were by far the nation 's most liberal , with 41 per cent identifying themselves in that way according to @entity14 , there is a closer correlation between liberal states and @entity64 states			1
only @entity77 and @entity78 rank among the most @entity64 but not the most liberal where as @entity17 and @entity59 state rank among the 10 most liberal states but not the 10 most @entity64 , @entity14 found			0
@entity53 , @entity60 and @entity82 were the three states where the most residents considered themselves moderate			0
however , the distribution of moderates across the states is not highly related to whether that state is a swing state			0
@entity53 typically votes @entity28 and has a high @entity28 identification while @entity60 is a blue state and @entity82 is a swing state			0
overall , @entity6 identified themselves as slightly more liberal last year than they did in 2011 , though more people still consider themselves conservative with 38 per cent , compared to 36 per cent for moderate or 23 per cent identifying themselves as liberal			1
in 2011 , 40 per cent of @entity6 citizens said they identified with being conservative , while 36 per cent said they were moderate and 21 per cent considered themselves liberal .			1

@entity3 and @entity4 tied as the nation 's second most conservative states
@entity10 was by far the most liberal in the @entity6 last year , with 41 per cent of residents identifying themselves that way followed by @entity17 and @entity18
overall , 23 per cent of @entity6 citizens considered themselves liberal up from 21 per cent in 2011
more people still claim they *'re* ' conservative ' with 38 per cent however it has dropped from 40 per cent in 2011
