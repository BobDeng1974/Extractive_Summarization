he was notorious for terrorising shipping in the west @entity2 , but treasures discovered among the wreckage of @entity6 's ship suggest the feared pirate may have had a caring side			1
marine archaeologists have found evidence of medical equipment used to heal the sick and wounded on board the pirate captain 's flagship , the @entity15			1
the artifacts are the latest clues of what life would have been like on the ship that became feared along the east coast of @entity22 and the @entity23			0
a pewter syringe ( above ) was found to contained mercury , which was used to treat diseases like syphilis the wreckage of the @entity15 was discovered in 1996 on a sandbar in @entity30 , @entity31 , where @entity6 , also known as @entity6 , ran it aground in 1718			1
since then archaeologists working on the @entity15 project have recovered cannons , glass beads , coins , pottery and gold dust from the remains of the vessel that have provided a glimpse of the pirates ' lifestyle			0
experts have found an array of fascinating artifacts from @entity6 's @entity15 's @entity49 wreckage since 1996			1
archaeologists have recovered onion bottles , two bells of @entity53 or @entity54 origin a coin weight with @entity15 's likeness stamped on it , buckles , glass beads , buttons , cuff links , pieces of wine glasses , a syringe , gold flakes , among others			2
the same team are said to have also found 11 cannons from the pirate ship , including one in 2005 and another in 2007			2
another rare find was a partly gilded hilt thought to have held the sword of @entity6 himself			2
but among the wreckage they have also found a number of items that would have been used for medical care , including a syringe , a blood porringer , an apothecary 's weight set , along with a mortar and pestle			1
archaeologists who have been studying the artifacts say that they suggest @entity6 made great efforts to keep his crew healthy			1
it is a image that contrasts greatly with the pirate captain 's ruthless and ferocious reputation			1
the @entity92 pirate had a fearsome appearance , tying his thick black beard into pigtails , stringing weapons from slings around his shoulders and sticking lighted matches under his hat when he went into battle			0
he also had a reputation for marooning members of his crew and enforcing strict discipline on board his ships			2
@entity107 , an archaeologist with the @entity108 at the @entity109 in @entity110 , @entity31 , said : ' treating the sick and injured of a sea - bound community on shipboard was challenging in the best of times			1
' chronic and periodic illnesses , wounds , amputations , toothaches , burns and other indescribable maladies of the crew , captain , and enslaved cargo had to be treated			0
' she added that maintaining his crew 's health was so important to @entity6 that when he turned the captured @entity128 slaver ship @entity127 into the @entity15 , he released most of the original crew but forced the three ship 's surgeons to stay			1
the wreck of the @entity15 was discovered where it had run aground in @entity134 ( above ) a mortar and pestle ( above ) was thought to have been used to prepare medical treatments for the crew @entity6 , played by @entity139 in the @entity141 films ( above ) , had a fearsome reputation among the medical equipment discovered on board were a pewter urethral syringe that has been found to contain traces of mercury			1
it is believed this was used to treat the sexually transmitted disease syphilis , although the mercury itself would have eventually poisoned the patient			2
divers have also recovered a set of apothecary weights that were thought to have been used to weigh out medicines while a mortar and pestle was used to crush treatments			0
they have also discovered the remains of two pump clysters , which would have been used to perform enemas , which would have allowed medication to be quickly absorbed			0
an 11ft anchor , weighing nearly 3,000lb , was recovered from the wreck of the @entity15 in 2011 the graphic above shows what the @entity15 would have looked like at the time of @entity6 they have yet to analyse the clysters to discover what they had contained			1
a blood porringer - used to measure out blood during bloodletting that was thought to cure some conditions - was also found			2
the remains of glass bottles and pots that may have contained drugs and balms were also discovered			2
dr @entity107 , who presented her findings to the @entity183 , also said that other items have been found that could have had medical uses			0
a silver needle and the remains of scissors could have been used to help repair injured sailors after battle while a brass set of screws could have been used in a tourniquet during amputations			0
dr @entity196 has used records from the original crew list of @entity127 to discover the names of some of the surgeons that served on the @entity15			0
the remains of square glass bottles were found on the wreck that may have contained drugs or medical gin @entity6 used his appearance to strike fear into his enemies but the new finds suggest he had a softer side these included the @entity127 surgeon major @entity213 , from @entity214 , @entity215 , from @entity216 and @entity217 , who was also a gunsmith			1
she claims that there is also evidence from records at the time that @entity6 would trade hostages for medical supplies			1
in 1718 , for example , he blockaded the port of @entity226 , @entity227 , capturing the ships that tried to enter			0
while parleying with the governor of @entity227 , @entity6 demanded a chest of medicine or he would murder all their prisoners			1
the governor complied an the prisoners were released			0
dr @entity107 told the @entity236 : ' to our knowledge , he never killed anyone directly , but did issue harsh punishment to some and wounded one of his crew on purpose			0
' but the fact that he retained , or kidnapped , if you prefer , the @entity128 surgeons leads us to think he had no other medical professionals on board at the time he stole the @entity127 and his men were suffering the ills of syphilis and scurvy and perhaps other wounds			0
' they were no good to him as crew members if they were not able to sail the ship and maintain the business at hand - that of piracy			0
' medical equipment and supplies and surgeons , may have been equally as important to him as gold was			1
' however , in november 1718 , @entity6 was finally hunted down by the @entity265 and he died in a final battle after apparently receiving more than 25 wounds			0
among the other items to be recovered from the shipwreck of the @entity15 are five cannons that @entity6 had installed on the vessel after he captured it			1
the cannons , one of which weighed more than 3,000lb , would have fired 6lb cannon balls at any ships daring to confront them			0
one of the five cannon used by @entity6 is raised from the wreck of the @entity15 's @entity281 in 2013 grains of gold have also been found on the vessel ( above ) hinting at the riches enjoyed by @entity6 's crew historians believe the largest cannon found was made in @entity289 , meaning @entity6 who was also known as @entity6 or @entity6 , had guns from different countries on board			1
in total , 40 cannons were believed to have been on board the @entity15			0
since the wreck was discovered in 1996 , 22 of the ship 's guns and about 280,000 artifacts have been recovered			2
other finds have included onion bottles , bells , buckles and a partly gilded hilt thought to have held @entity6 's sword .			0
