despite the numerous health benefits of condoms , they 're often criticised for reducing the level of pleasure felt by men , and women , during sex			1
with this in mind , a pair of @entity10 students has created a digital prototype device that sends short electric impulses along the underside of a condom			1
this can increase the amount , and range of sensations , felt during sex - and opens up the technology to be used with other wearable devices and sensors			2
the prototype was made using a soft ' stimulating sleeve ' fitted with electrodes a porn studio in @entity38 has started using software to digitally remove condoms from scenes in post-production			1
state law insists scenes are filmed using condoms			0
however , this is said to be damaging business ; causing permits and viewing numbers to drop dramatically			0
@entity48 used cgi and airbrushing in their latest production in a bid to appease the law and viewers			0
@entity26 , the prototype was created by @entity30 and @entity31 from @entity33 ’s @entity32			2
using their design , @entity56 and @entity31 said they envisage conductive leads being directly embedded into existing condoms by manufacturers , while ' maintaining the soundness and protection that the condoms already provide			0
' to test the range of sensations , @entity56 and @entity31 made a soft , ' stimulating sleeve ' fitted with conductive arrays of electrodes along the underneath part of the shaft			1
the device is powered by a programmable @entity75 microcontroller , which can receive various inputs and commands , and send electrical impulses to small electrodes lining the inside of the sleeve			1
' this type of device could be hooked up to numerous controllers , directed in person or using existing internet software , ' said the designers			0
the device is powered by a @entity75 microcontroller , pictured , which can take in various inputs and commands , and send electrical impulses to small electrodes lining the inside of the sleeve			1
the amount of electricity applied is ' very small ' although the designers did not specify the exact charge one example @entity56 and @entity31 tested was connecting the device to a homemade breath sensor			2
users could control the pulses by changing the frequency of breaths and during tests , the device was described as ‘ pleasurable , comfortable and exciting			0
’ in terms of safety , the amount of electricity applied is very small – although the designers did not specify the exact charge - and the designs have all been tested by the makers , personally			2
@entity56 and @entity31 have set up an @entity115 campaign to fund the project and are hoping to raise $ 10,000 ( £ 6,000 ) by march 31 .			0

the @entity26 prototype was created by @entity10 students from @entity120
device sends short electric impulses along the underside of the condom
it was designed to *encourage* men to wear condoms , which can *traditionally* reduce the levels of pleasure felt during sex
prototype was made using a soft ' stimulating sleeve ' fitted with electrodes
it is powered by a microcontroller that can connect to various sensors
the maker ’s claim the amount of electricity applied is ' very small '
