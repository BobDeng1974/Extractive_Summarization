speaking in @entity8 , @entity4 's prime minister @entity68 said that ' @entity70 police are investigating , but it 's obviously a suicide			1
it 's hard to figure out the motives or causes			0
' @entity11 is believed to have been unhappy about living apart from his @entity54 - based wife and their 17 - year - old son the death cast a pall on the second day of a meeting of @entity5 foreign ministers			1
