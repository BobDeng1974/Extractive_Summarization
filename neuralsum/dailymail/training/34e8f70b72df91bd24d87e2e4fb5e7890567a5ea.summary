by @entity0 , @entity1 published : 18:06 est , 30 june 2013 updated : 18:34 est , 30 june 2013 whiplash claims are soaring despite a drop in the number of accidents , motor industry experts revealed today			1
up to 90 per cent of third party claims involve relatively small amounts of cash are bogus whiplash cases			1
it means that @entity12 - already dubbed the ‘ whiplash capital of the world ’ with more than £ 1billion of bogus claims a year - is now also beating the @entity16 as the most litigious country in the world			1
fresh evidence shows that there has been a boom in ' claims farming ' by law firms of backdated incidents which has artificially boosted the number of claimants leading insurance analysts say new figures show whiplash claims have increased by a disproportionately high level at a time when claims for accident damage to cars have decreased			1
by rights , crash and injury data should run in tandem , they say			0
they blamed the alarming disparity on a boom in @entity16 style ‘ claims farming ’ by law firms and claims firms of backdated or historic incidents which is artificially boosting the number of whiplash claimants - many of them bogus or exaggerated			1
the fresh evidence was revealed by the @entity49 ( @entity50 ) which independently assesses financial risks and liabilities to businesses and pension funds			0
it said there was a five per cent increase in the proportion of accidents involving third - party injury claims involving bodily injury in @entity62 and @entity63 last year			2
nine out of ten of these were from ‘ small whiplash - like claims ’ of under £ 20,000 - with the average being £ 9,512			1
however , at the same time there has been a decrease in third party insurance claims involving damage to cars			0
the report was authored by @entity76 , chairman of the @entity49 who recently told @entity78 watchdogs that up to 60 per cent of whiplash claims were ‘ exaggerated , misrepresented or fraudulent ’ meaning up to £ 1billion claims a year are wholly or partly bogus			1
he explained : ‘ a total of 90per cent of the third party injury claims made in 2012 were what we consider ‘ small claims ’ for less than £ 20,000			1
’ ‘ coupled with the average claim figure of £ 9,512 , this suggests that the majority of claims continue to be for whiplash - like injuries			2
’ a number of claims made last year were for accidents in 2011 and 2010 , suggesting that a high volume of back - dated claims have been filed			0
this is known as ‘ claims farming ’			2
mr @entity76 noted : ‘ the data we have collected for the last four years clearly shows a decrease in the number of accidents and you would expect that to correspond with a decrease in the number of third party injury claims			0
‘ instead we have seen an increase in injury claims			0
the motor insurance industry paid out £ 2.2billion in whiplash claims in 2011 ‘ this could mean that people are driving less safely			1
however police data shows that the number of motor accidents involving casualties has decreased			0
the other conclusion that you can draw is that claims farming is on the increase			2
’ mr @entity76 added : ‘ the proportion of claims for insured accidents involving bodily injury is higher in the @entity12 than in the @entity16 , which is generally considered the most litigious jurisdiction			2
’ he noted the recent suggestion by the @entity129 - to which he gave evidence - that the @entity12 was the ‘ whiplash capital of the world ’ noting : ’ they may well have a point			0
” the @entity49 ’ figures were based on analysis of third - party motor claims , looking at data from around 95percent of the @entity12 motor insurance industry			0
the motor insurance industry paid out £ 10.7 billion in claims in 2011 , of which whiplash claims cost approximately £ 2.2 billion , the @entity140 ( @entity140 ) has told mps			1
with whiplash claims representing 20 per cent of overall claims expenditure , this represents approximately £ 90 of the average premium			1
the @entity140 blamed the dysfunctional compensation system ’ for leading to a ‘ growing compensation culture ’ in the @entity12 , as well as ‘ aggressive marketing by claims management companies ’			0
referral fees paid by claimant solicitors were banned from april 1 this year			0
one reason for the ‘ whiplash epidemic ’ is that it is cheaper to settle than to fight cases suspected to be fraudulent , say insurance experts			2
the scale of the scandal in @entity62 and @entity63 is much greater than countries like @entity160 , where lawyers ’ claim fees are severely limited			0
insurance underwriters noted : ‘ it ’s nothing to do with @entity160 necks being stronger than @entity12 necks			0
’ @entity167 , manager of the @entity168 which manage 90 insurance underwriting syndicates told @entity78 that bogus claims were ‘ in overdrive ’ because whiplash was too easy to fake with too few checks .			1

up to 90 per cent of claims are small whiplash claims for less than £ 20,000
boom in @entity16 style claims farming by law firms of backdated incidents
@entity78 watchdogs have been *warned* that up to 60 per cent of claims are exaggerated or fraudulent
