it was a striking image of fishing boat sheds with @entity2 in the background and was heralded as the best landscape photograph among hundreds of entries in a top competition			1
but now the photographer who won the prestigious prize has been stripped of his title and the £ 10,000 prize money - because of his use of @entity12			0
@entity13 , 43 , from @entity14 , @entity15 , won the take a @entity17 award last month as it was a ' clear favourite ' of the judges who agreed it best captured an aspect of the @entity23 landscape			1
a photographer showed how the position of the clouds and the light in @entity13 's winning photograph of @entity2 was physically impossible because the sun would have to be in two different places at once			1
the red lines in the image point to two different points in the sky where the sun would be positioned if the shadows and light were correct striking : @entity13 's picture of upturned boats on the coast of @entity2 , @entity41 , @entity42 , was doctored to include clouds in the sky to make it look darker and gloomy @entity13 's father 's photograph of the same landscape , also doctored , was taken nine minutes later and the light is shown to be different however after winning the prize , mr @entity13 said he was subject to a ' witch - hunt ' for adding clouds in the sky , leading to his disqualification for employing excessive digital manipulation in his winning entry			1
two other photographers turned detective and highlighted in their own blogs how the photograph was realistically impossible and days later mr @entity13 was pulled from the competition			1
mr @entity13 told @entity62 that he had removed some moored boats in the middle of the harbour and doctored the sky to make it look dark and gloomy by adding a few clouds			1
he said : ‘ i added clouds because the sky was a bit boring			1
unfortunately , while i do n’t feel like i have done anything wrong , i did n’t read the regulations and it does say that replacing the sky is not allowed			0
‘ the purists out there were not happy			0
@entity78 about with pictures has been done for over 100 years			0
i treat my photography as art and i try to make the best looking picture			0
' after winning the prize in october , two landscape photographers posted blogs on the internet explaining through a sequence of images why mr @entity13 's photograph could not be real			1
one of the photographers , @entity91 , who entered the competition the previous year , highlighted through a series of red lines how the varying lights and shadows in the photograph were realistically impossible			1
for the shadows on fishing boat sheds and the light from the sky to be correct , the sun would have had to have been in two different places at once - highlighted by where the red arrows point to			1
while the red lines on the shadow on the sheds point to the correct position of the sun , the arrows on the other image point to a position in the sky where the sun would not have been at that time of day , according to mr @entity91			2
atmospheric : @entity118 's misty view of pines in the @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity42 , won the ' @entity123 ' category ambiance : @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity42 , the @entity128 winner in the @entity130 award mr @entity13 , who has only been taking landscape photographs for two years , said since winning the competition he had received abusive emails from other photographers			1
he said : ' to me i feel like i have been hounded for days , it has been quite unsettling			0
' i ca n’t blame take a view , the witch hunt was not going to stop anyway			0
‘ i felt like i was being investigated by the @entity139			0
' he said some of evidence used against him was a picture that his father took nine minutes after him on the same day - which showed the clouds in a different position in the sky			2
his father , @entity149 , told @entity62 : ' it is quite accepted and desirable to add another sky to enhance the characteristics and remove ugly modern day rubbish and graffiti etc , after all this is art. ' thousands and thousands of photographers in camera clubs do this all the time , it is accepted by the world ruling body @entity161 as long as composite images are the work of the photographer			2
' the contest 's organisers , take a view , said mr @entity13 ’s photograph was assessed in ' good faith ' and was the ' clear favourite ' of the judges			2
winner : this wistful image of fishermen on @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 , was crowned winner in the @entity130 award living the view category lines in the landscape : the 8:30 from @entity185 crosses @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity42 in this picture which won the @entity190 @entity191 , founder of the competition said : ' this is extremely regrettable and it appears there was no deliberate intention to deceive the judges but the level of manipulation means that this photograph gained an unfair advantage in this category and in winning the overall competition			1
' the integrity of the competition is very important to all involved and it was clear that disqualification was the only course of action open to us			0
' a second photograph by mr @entity13 , which won the ' classic view ' category of the competition , has also been disqualified			1
