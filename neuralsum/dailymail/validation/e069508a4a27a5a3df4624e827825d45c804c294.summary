the 31 - year - old told @entity13 getting back into shape for the pageant has been more challenging compared to previous years , particularly because she has to juggle her time with her two young kids			1
but mrs @entity1 says she would n't have it any other way as her family always comes first and further hopes she can encourage other mothers to love their post-baby bodies too			1
@entity3 was crowned mrs @entity1 when she was 37 weeks pregnant and is now gearing up for @entity4 - just eight weeks after giving birth to her second child the former model turned full - time mother has completely embraced her post-baby body but recalls struggling to accept her changing figure			1
she is pictured ( left ) before becoming a mother and then three weeks after giving birth to her son @entity30 ( right ) family comes first for the mother - of - two , aged 31 , with daughter @entity34 , who is now 19 - months - old it was only eight weeks ago that mrs @entity3 , who has been in the modelling industry since the age of three , gave birth to her baby boy @entity30			1
she and her husband @entity40 also have a 19 - month - old daughter @entity34			2
but mrs @entity3 is determined more than ever to represent @entity1 and will be flying to @entity42 in the @entity43 to compete against more than 60 other women around the world			1
' it 's an honour to be representing the country and i 'm really looking forward to it all , ' she said			0
mrs @entity3 , who was recently crowned mrs @entity1 2015 and is also an ambassador for charity program @entity52 , says she became involved in the competition as it was n't solely based on looks			1
' this pageant is really refreshing for me because it 's open to all married women from all backgrounds , shapes and sizes , ' she said			0
' about 50 per cent of it is about raising awareness about your charity while the rest is about your evening gown and your health and fitness			0
' mrs @entity70 gave birth to her second child , a son called @entity73 in january since giving birth to her second child , mrs @entity3 's attitude has changed			1
' it took me some time to finally accept my body during my pregnancy and afterwards too , ' she said			2
' i 've been a model most of my life so not being in control of my body was really hard for me			2
my belly was growing and it felt like i was gaining five kilos just by looking at a piece of lettuce			0
' looking at myself in the mirror after my first child , with a fuller figure , was really difficult			0
' but when i was pregnant with @entity30 , i went in with brighter eyes and knew what to expect from my body			2
mrs @entity3 back in her modelling days ( left ) and then with her second child ( right ) ' i especially knew i had to have better and more positive views about my changing body in order to become a good role model for my daughter			1
' and it is with that attitude she has decided to go into the mrs international competition			2
in between tending to her two children , mrs @entity3 takes advantage of whatever free time she gets			1
' i try to go the gym every night when my husband is home to look after the kids and do about 30 minutes of cardio , ' she said			0
' of course , i actually do n't end up doing this every day because as a mother something last minute always comes up			0
' but i 'm going to sign up to do a heavy training session with my personal trainer so i 'll be committed to do that once a week			0
' during nap - time for the kids , i try and squeeze in any other training			2
' piper and husband @entity40 with their first - born , daughter @entity34 last year mrs @entity3 is also very conscious of her diet , particularly because she is currently breastfeeding			1
' i have to make sure i eat healthy for my baby so i ca n't just eat salads all the time for the sake of the competition , ' she said			2
' plus this pageant does n't have a swimwear section and instead focuses on health and fitness which is also why i wanted to get involved			0
' mrs @entity3 says her main goal is n't about getting her pre-baby body back			1
' there 's too much pressure on mums these days to go back to the way they were and i do n't think that 's a realistic goal , ' she said			0
' i 've had two children and there is no hiding that			0
my focus now is being fit and healthy rather than skinny			0
' so i 'd really like to reach out to other mothers , encouraging them to go easy on themselves because it 's an amazing thing that we can have children and bring them into this world			0
' mrs @entity3 says she 's feeling pretty confident about the competition			1
' it feels good to be part of something i 'm familiar with again and hopefully i can bring home another crown for my daughter , ' she said .			0
