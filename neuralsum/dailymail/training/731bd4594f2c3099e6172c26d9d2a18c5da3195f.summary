a former @entity1 director said that the @entity2 is the only country that could carry out a sustained attack against @entity5 's nuclear facilities in an effort to dissuade any such action by @entity8			1
@entity9 , who was the director of the @entity1 until 2009 , granted an interview with @entity8 's oldest daily newspaper saying that issues regarding the location of the weapons , the stockpile of the attacker , and the collection of sufficient planning would all cause problems if @entity8 were to attack and not @entity2			1
' i do not underestimate the @entity8 talent , but geometry and physics tell us that @entity5 's nuclear program would pose a difficult challenge to any military , ' mr @entity9 told @entity28			2
@entity29 : former @entity1 director @entity9 spoke to an @entity8 newspaper telling them a list of reasons why @entity2 would strike @entity5 more efficiently than @entity5 he explained that because any thorough attack on @entity5 would not be a one - time event and would require repeated efforts , the @entity2 would be better equipped because ' @entity8 's resources are more limited ' than @entity2 's			1
for decades , the relationship between the @entity38 of @entity5 and the jewish state of @entity8 has been contentious but more extreme rhetoric by @entity5 leaders escalated the balance to a worrying tipping point			0
as @entity45 sanctions have done little to prevent @entity5 from continuing their nuclear weapons development , @entity8 continues to feel pressure to pre-emptively strike , but mr @entity9 was quick to push for patience , giving several reasons as justification			1
' there is no absolute certainty that all targets are known , ' he said of the various nuclear development sites in @entity5			0
dangerous : tensions have continued to grow over @entity5 's nuclear capability , and president @entity58 ( center ) was see touring the facilities in 2008 locations : @entity9 said one of the problems with any potential strike would be that it will be difficult to find out where all of @entity5 's facilities - like this one in @entity68 - are located ' they will have to be revisited - which only the @entity69 would be able to do - and the operation will only set the @entity5 back some time and actually push them to do that which it is supposed to prevent , getting nuclear weapons ' while it is probably true that the so - called " window " regarding effective action is closing , there is still some time , as real decisions are to be made in 2013 or 2014			2
' mr @entity9 's explanation comes just two days after president @entity81 publicly confirmed that @entity2 forces will be taking a number of less violent actions in an effort to dissuade @entity5 from doing anything drastic			0
the @entity87 reported that tougher sanctions on @entity5 oil , a new antimissile system based out of @entity91 that is specialized for the region , and varied naval exercises will show that @entity2 will get directly involved if @entity5 strikes .			0
