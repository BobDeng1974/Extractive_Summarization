during a rare interview , @entity3 ceo @entity4 appeared to suggest that a less expensive version of their covetable but pricey gadgets might be in the pipeline			1
' we are making moves to make things more affordable , ' he said at the @entity15 technology and internet conference in @entity16			1
rare interview : @entity3 ceo @entity4 admitted the tech giant was looking at making ' more affordable ' products the revelation came after mr @entity4 said that he saw a ' wide open field ' because @entity3 's @entity1 was currently ' only available to 50 per cent of [ mobile phone ] subscribers in the world '			1
asked whether the problem might be that only 50 per cent could afford an @entity1 , mr @entity4 said : ' good question			2
our @entity27 is " great products " - we would never do something that is n't a great product , that 's not why we 're on this earth			0
' that said , if you look at what we 've done to appeal to people that are price sensitive â€” lower price of @entity1 , @entity41 , in most recent quarter , not enough supply of @entity1 - surprised us			2
' he added : ' we are making moves to make things more affordable ' , but insisted @entity3 still wanted to make something ' great '			2
he said : ' if you look at @entity3 's history , look at @entity50 : it was $ 399			0
today you can get an @entity52 for $ 49			0
' instead of how can you cheapen to get it lower , we were saying how can we make something great ? @entity3 ceo @entity4 said they wanted to make ' great products ' like the @entity56 , left , and the @entity57 , right ' the same thing in a different way : people said why do n't you have a @entity61 that 's less than $ 1,000 ? we worked on them , we could n't do a great product			1
what did we do ? we invented @entity57 and it starts at $ 329			0
' sometimes you can take the issue and solve it in different ways			0
' mr @entity4 added : ' we will never make a crappy product			2

@entity3 's mr @entity4 said that while the company was looking at ways to get shareholders more returns , the cash might be used to make a major acquisition , and said the lawsuit was ' bizarre ' when the cash reserves put the company in such a position of strength			1
