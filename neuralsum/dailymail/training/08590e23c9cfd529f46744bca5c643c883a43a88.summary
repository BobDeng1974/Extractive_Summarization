by @entity0 published : 19:09 est , 5 march 2014 updated : 10:42 est , 6 march 2014 business secretary @entity2 has accused teachers of failing to provide good careers advice for their pupils teachers are failing students because they ‘ know absolutely nothing about the world of work ’ , business secretary @entity2 has said			1
the @entity13 minister was accused of being ‘ crass ’ and ‘ insulting ’ to teachers after suggesting they are to blame for a lack of good careers advice in schools			1
his remarks were seized on by political opponents , and risk undoing months of attempts by the @entity13 to win back some of their traditional support in the teaching profession by attacking education secretary @entity24			1
the business secretary was speaking to hundreds of senior figures in the manufacturing industry , and claimed @entity29 schemes to get students interested in careers in their sector were being thwarted by an ‘ underlying problem ’ - teachers themselves			1
‘ there has been an argument in @entity29 about how to get the right careers advice in schools and successive governments have frankly messed this up , ’ mr @entity2 said			1
‘ but the underlying problem is of course that most teachers , particularly in the secondary sector , are graduates			0
‘ they know how universities work , they know what you have to do to get an a-level , they know about @entity50 forms – but they know absolutely nothing about the world of work			0
‘ they do n't know how to direct people to apprenticeships or traineeships which we 're now doing as a first stage for people			0
‘ we 're issuing guidance to schools on how they should put in place proper careers guidance in schools linked to the world of work , but we start from a bad place			2
’ a senior source at the @entity72 said : ‘ these comments are offensive to teachers who work hard every day			0
cable should pay a visit to some inner city schools before saying teachers know nothing about the world of work			2
instead of lashing out at teachers , @entity2 should be getting business to engage with schools			1
’ mr @entity2 claimed @entity29 schemes to interest students in careers in their industry were thwarted by teachers @entity87 , head of @entity88 in @entity89 , said mr @entity2 ’s remarks were ‘ absurd ’ , pointing out that many teachers converted from other careers			1
‘ before i went into teaching in 2000 , i was responsible for managing a marketing and advertising budget for a cosmetics company which was larger than our entire school budget is now , ’ she said			0
‘ there would be very few industries in which staff would have sufficient experience in all other business sectors to be able to give career advice			2
‘ many teachers do convert to teaching from other careers , usually because they feel strongly about the vocational aspect of teaching , but there is nothing wrong with being a career teacher			2
@entity112 , general secretary of the @entity113 , labelled mr @entity2 's comments ' crass ' ‘ we do n't pretend to have an in depth knowledge of the manufacturing industry but even as a primary school , we have already this year taken our ten - and 11 - year - old children on visits to manufacturing factories and had people talk to them who do			0
‘ when i was at school there was a careers advice centre which was separate to the school which sent people in to do practice interviews and offer careers advice			1
i 'm not sure at what point careers advice became the job of schools alone			1
’ teachers ’ representatives accused mr cable of seeking to curry favour from a business audience , saying he was ‘ finding scapegoats and playing to the gallery ’			1
@entity112 , general secretary of the @entity113 ( @entity113 ) , said : ‘ this is a crass remark , which is insulting to teachers who are workers in their own right			2
‘ as the government ’s own survey shows , teachers work an extraordinary number of hours and show real dedication to the world of work			0
indeed , the teaching profession mirrors society and many of our teachers come from diverse backgrounds with different life experiences			0
they are a resource to the young people they teach , not a hindrance			0
’ a spokeswoman for the @entity163 was unapologetic			0
‘ the business secretary was echoing concerns from industry about the need to improve the quality of careers advice in schools , ’ she said			1
‘ he was making the point that teachers have an important role in making sure their pupils are aware of all options available to them to help them build a career			0
' for some this may be via a graduate route , but for others a vocational skill or qualification is more appropriate			0
