guilty : @entity0 , 30 , told an alleged rape victim it was her fault @entity3 has dropped the case a policewoman was jailed yesterday after lying to bosses and an alleged rape victim that prosecutors were not going to press charges			1
in fact , pc @entity0 had not even passed the case file to the @entity3			1
@entity0 , who had taken on detective duties as a sexual offences - trained officer at @entity17 , was assigned to the case in july 2011			2
the alleged rapist was arrested and interviewed , and his mobile phone and computer examined			0
but when @entity0 was later asked for a progress report , she told a superior the @entity3 had dropped it			1
it was then logged on the police system as needing ‘ no further action ’ and @entity0 even told the alleged victim that prosecution lawyers had decided to drop the case , despite knowing it had never been passed to them			1
yesterday , the 30 - year - old , from @entity33 in @entity34 , broke down in tears as she was jailed for four months at @entity36 , in @entity37 , having already pleading guilty to a charge of misconduct in public office			1
prosecutor @entity41 said : ‘ she falsely informed her superiors and the victim of the case that the @entity3 had advised that no further action be taken against the suspect when in fact no file had been sent to the @entity3 , no such advice had been received			1
’ the court heard @entity0 even gave superiors the name of the @entity3 lawyer who had taken the decision , which was also a lie			1
in february last year , @entity0 spoke to the complainant , telling her that the @entity3 had dropped the case because she had reported it too late so there was no physical evidence			1
miss @entity41 said this was a blow to the complainant , adding : ‘ she was clearly upset because it implied that the decision to some extent was her fault for reporting the rape late			1
she failed to correct the assumption of her superiors at @entity17 that the case had been investigated and passed on to the @entity3 ( @entity3 ) , the court heard ‘ on the evening that she was telephoned by @entity71 to say that there was no further action , she tried to take her own life			2
‘ she says that because of miss @entity0 ’s actions , the man she states raped her is walking round the streets			0
’ the matter only came to light after an independent adviser allocated to the complainant pursued the matter and it transpired that the @entity3 had never been sent the file			2
@entity0 told the adviser she would ‘ chase ’ prosecutors			2
when she realised the truth was coming out in april last year , she called her professional standards department to confess			0
guilty : @entity0 pictured at an earlier hearing the rape allegation was re-investigated and the alleged perpetrator was charged			2
he is to stand trial in may			0
judge @entity94 said : ‘ you let down the police			0
you let down the wider public , but in particular you let down the complainant			0
‘ you looked her in the eye and you told her things that were untrue and you knew were untrue			0
‘ that was a very cruel thing to do			0
’ @entity103 , defending , said @entity0 was depressed at the time and had had a breakdown			0
she had split from her fiance weeks before their wedding , and later suffered a miscarriage			0

@entity0 , 30 , told victim she had reported the alleged rape too late
@entity122 ' looked victim in the eye ' and said prosecutors had dropped the case
in fact , @entity0 had never passed the file on to @entity3 in the first place
