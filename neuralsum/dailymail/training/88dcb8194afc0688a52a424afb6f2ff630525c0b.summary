by @entity0 four drunken holidaymakers have been forced to write grovelling apology letters to the people of @entity4 after being caught throwing empty alcohol bottles into the sea			1
residents in the @entity9 resort watched from their windows as the gang , who had come to the town for the @entity14 , lurched drunkenly and cheered as they hurled bottles from the cliff top at the @entity18 beauty spot			1
furious calls went through to the police and sergeant @entity21 caught up with the gang , in their early twenties , who were lurching unsteadily back to their holiday campsite			1
holiday beauty spot : the drunken revellers threw empty alcohol bottles from the cliff tops at @entity18 beach he said ' i decided there and then to make them write letters of apology to the residents			1
' what they did was just idiotic and unbelievable , really			2
' they thought it would be fun and had n't even thought of the possible consequences			2
' so we were sat there thinking what we could do them for , and checked to see if anything had landed on the beach , because if it had we could have got them to clean the beach			0
' we found bottles out in the sea , so it was a minor offence for littering			1
' we thought the most appropriate thing would be for the lads to write letters of apology			1
' so we sent them away with the bits of paper and told them to drop them into the police station by 3pm the next day , which they did			0
' we told them we 'd be out hunting for them if they did n't			0
' grovelling : sergeant @entity21 decided to ask the drunken holidaymakers to write apology letters ' inconsiderate behaviour ' : one letter writer claimed to be dearly sorry for disturbing the peace one letter read : ' i am sorry for all of our actions and it was also very inconsiderate , we will be sure to never act so stupid again and i regret what happened			1
' another said ' to whom this may concern , i am extremely sorry the incident occoured ( sic )			0
it was just a moment of madness			0
' a third man wrote ' all apologies go to all residents around the area for disturbing them			1
' one acknowledged that he would not have committed the offence in his own local area			0
' it is something i would not have done in my own town and i am genuinely deeply sorry for bottles being thrown in the sea while sitting on the local cliffs , ' he said			2
' a moment of madness ' : the letters assure local residents that there will be no more raucous behaviour apologies : one letter writer even thanks the police for being ' polite ' and ' genuine ' when speaking to him sergeant @entity21 said he stressed to them the dangers of what they 'd done			1
' actions like this can have a huge impact			0
in the first instance it 's ruining the coast , which is a beautiful part of the world where we do n't want rubbish , ' he said			0
' secondly , there 's the danger side , when the bottles wash up and people can tread on them and suffer serious injury			2
' then there is the danger to the marine wildlife			0
' hopefully it made them think about everything we told them and will have had more of an impact than anything else we could have done			2
' @entity4 has already issued a warning that parents who give their children alcohol will be named and shamed @entity4 has already issued a summer season warning that parents who fuel their youngsters with booze for a ' no holds barred ' holiday in the resort will be named and shamed			0
the @entity151 campaign group says naming and shaming could stop what they call ' parent dealing ' where mums and dads are happy to let their offspring have alcohol for summer breaks			0
@entity160 , from @entity151 , said that existing laws might not be adequate for dealing with parents who supply children with large amounts of alcohol before sending them on holiday			0
@entity168 and @entity169 and crime commissioner @entity170 said : ' parental buying is a problem , but you have to give credit to retailers , they can detect this sort of buying and try and prevent it			1
' ' we believe we now have evidence that the 24 - hour licensing actually enables pre-loading			1
' there 's now a feeling that you can drink as long as you want			2
it allows you to purchase cheap booze , go home , and get tanked up			0
then you know you have plenty more time in the night to enjoy drinking			0
' for me it 's a no - brainer to try and limit some of this licensing during the night			1
it 's not working , 24 - hour licensing has enabled a mentality of pre-loading			1
' ' we are seventh in the league table of 43 policing areas on violent crime , we are fourth on rape , and we have been searching for the reasons behind this and we have come down heavily on the issue of misuse of alcohol			2
