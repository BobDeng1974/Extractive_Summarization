@entity1 and niece @entity0 went to @entity2 for cosmetic surgery and now say they are left disfigured and regretting the decision two @entity7 women who travelled to @entity8 to undergo plastic surgery are now warning others not to make the same decision they did			1
@entity1 and her niece @entity0 decided to save money by outsourcing their medical procedures to a facility in @entity16			1
but after what they say were gruesome and life - threatening results at @entity2 , the two women say they wish they ’d just saved their money and had the work done at home			1
she chose to have surgery at a @entity16 , @entity8 hospital and says she regrets the decision @entity29 chose to go to @entity2 for two reasons : first , after losing 130 pounds , she said she wanted the remaining loose skin removed via a tummy tuck			1
and second , the hospital told @entity29 she ’d be charged just $ 5,000 in total			2
according to the @entity36 , that ’s about the average cost for the surgery in the @entity39 , but does not include costly anesthesia , operating facilities , or other expenses			2
after her dramatic weight loss , she was ready to see the full effect of all her efforts			0
it ’s heavy , it ’s loose skin and it ’s just hard to live like that , ’ @entity29 told @entity46			0
it seemed like the perfect solution , until the women made it to @entity16			0
' i made a very , very wrong decision to go through with it ' : @entity29 and her niece say the @entity2 was actually a clinic in a strip mall when they arrived there post-surgery : @entity29 underwent a tummy tuck and her niece had surgery on her breasts			1
' i had skin hanging out of the incisions , ' @entity0 said			1
they said the @entity2 , pristine and welcoming on their website , was more like a clinic in a strip mall			1
despite reservations , @entity1 and @entity0 decided to go through with it			1
‘ i was already there , ’ @entity0 told the @entity80 @entity79 affiliate			1
‘ i knew i was n’t going to get my money back and i made a very , very wrong decision to go through with it			2
and i should have listened to my intuition but i did n’t			0
’ nightmare : @entity0 and her aunt @entity1 say they are now both disfigured from their surgery prior to their surgeries , @entity29 taped a testimonial at the clinic			1
she beamed into the camera , ‘ i ’m very excited ! ’ but that excitement quickly turned to fear for both women			0
‘ immediately after the bandages were removed , ’ @entity0 said , ‘ i took a look in the mirror at my breasts , i had skin hanging out of the incisions			1
’ her aunt was in bad shape as well			0
' i 'm very excited ' : @entity29 seems thrilled in a testimonial she taped before the surgery in @entity16			2
now , she asks , ' why did i do this ? ' ‘ when i went to the hospital , they said we do n’t know if we can save her , ’ @entity29 told @entity46			0
thankfully , both women survived the ordeal			0
however , they both now complain of disfigurement and say @entity16 wo n’t even acknowledge they were ever patients			0
a hospital spokesperson invoked the @entity117 ’ @entity118 and declined to comment			0
unfortunately , stateside experts in the world of surgery abroad say these women ’s story comes as no big surprise			2
' we answer to higher calling ' : the @entity2 site promises life - hanging results from bariatric and other surgeries but advice group patients without @entity132 says to be very choosy about overseas surgeries ‘ patients who travel for medical care can greatly increase their chances of successful outcomes by placing quality over cost - savings , ’ wrote the group @entity132 on @entity135 in response to the @entity46 story			1
the group also suggests ‘ carefully vetting the hospital or clinic for accreditation and other quality indicators , and checking doctor 's credentials			0
’ left with no legal recourse , the women said they just want others to be more cautious than they were			2
‘ many times i said “ why did i do this ? ” i should have saved enough money and had it done with a doctor in @entity7 , ’ @entity29 said .			0
