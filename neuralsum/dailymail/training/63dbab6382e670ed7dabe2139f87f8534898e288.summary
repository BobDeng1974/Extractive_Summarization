’ aftermath : police cordon off the scene of the shooting which took place in march last year parents : @entity128 , left , and @entity129 whose daughter was shot arrive at the @entity38 mr @entity89 added : ‘ the reality of this shooting may be that while there was an intention to kill the suspected rival gang member , the gunman and his accomplices could not have cared less if someone else was shot too			2
’ the second victim , @entity139 , 35 , who was chatting to the owner before returning home to his flat above the shop , was hit in the face but miraculously survived			2
