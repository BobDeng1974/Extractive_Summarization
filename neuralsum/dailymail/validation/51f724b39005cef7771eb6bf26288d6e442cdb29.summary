a crystal with a ‘ forbidden symmetry ’ that was once thought to be impossible to form naturally has been found			1
the so - called quasicrystal was discovered in a 4.5 billion - year - old meteorite in a remote region of northeastern @entity6			1
and studying it could help scientists find out how mysterious materials like this formed in the universe			1
scientists at @entity14 , @entity12 studied an ancient meteorite ( shown ) and found a quasicrystal with a structure that it was once dubbed ' impossible '			1
it was thought such material could not naturally occur in nature because the crystal has a symmetry in which atoms should n't form the discovery was made by a team from @entity14 , and is the second natural quasicrystal ever found - both in this meteorite			1
prior to the team finding the first natural quasicrystal in 2009 , researchers thought that the structures were too fragile and energetically unstable to be formed by natural processes			2
‘ the finding of a second naturally occurring quasicrystal confirms that these materials can form in nature and are stable over cosmic time scales , ’ said dr @entity33 from @entity14			1
on the outside , quasicrystals are solid minerals that look like quite normal , but it is their inner structure that fascinates scientists			2
instead of the regularly repeating clusters of atoms seen in most crystals , quasicrystals contain a more subtle and intricate atomic arrangement involving two or more repeating clusters			2
as a result , a quasicrystal ’s atoms can be arranged in ways that are not commonly found in crystals , such as the shape of a 20 - sided icosahedron with the symmetry of a soccer ball			1
the difference between crystals and quasicrystals can be visualized by imagining a tiled floor : tiles that are six - sided hexagons can fit neatly against each other to cover the entire floor			0
but five - sided pentagons or 10 - sided decagons laid next to each will result in gaps between tiles			0
the team published the findings in the journal @entity75			0
dr @entity33 said the discovery raises the possibility that other types of quasicrystals can be formed in nature			2
quasicrystals are very hard , have low friction , and do n't conduct heat very well - making them good candidates for applications such as protective coatings on items ranging from airplanes to non-stick cookware			0
the newly discovered quasicrystal , which is yet to be named , has a structure that resembles flat 10 - sided disks stacked in a column			0
this type of structure is impossible in ordinary crystals , in which atoms are packed closely together in a repeated and orderly fashion , earning it the ‘ forbidden symmetry ’ moniker			1
‘ the structure is saying ' ” i am not a crystal , but on the other hand , i am not random either , ” ’ dr @entity33 said			0
crystals with these ‘ forbidden symmetries ’ had been created in the laboratory , but it was n't until 2009 that dr @entity33 and his team reported the first natural quasicrystal , now known as icosahedrite , in a rock that had been collected years before in @entity115 , @entity6			1
on the left , the top panel shows the symmetry of the first natural quasicrystal called icosahedrite			2
the lower panel shows the symmetry of the recently discovered quasicrystal , which has not yet been named			2
right is the ordered yet non-standard pattern of the quasicrystal revealed by an electron beam crystals with these ‘ forbidden symmetries ’ had been created in the laboratory , but it was n't until 2009 that dr @entity33 and his team reported the first natural quasicrystal , now known as icosahedrite , in a rock that had been collected years before in @entity115 , @entity6 ( shown ) the researchers confirmed that the quasicrystal originated in an extraterrestrial body that formed about 4.57 billion years ago - around the time our solar system formed			1
they published those results in the @entity135 in 2012			0
‘ bringing back the material and showing that it was of natural origins was an important scientific barrier to overcome , ’ dr @entity33 said			0
this new quasicrystal was found in a different grain of the same meteorite and has 10-fold , or decagonal , symmetry			1
it is made up of aluminum , nickel and iron , which normally are not found together in the same mineral because aluminum binds quickly to oxygen , blocking attachment to nickel and iron			0
the researchers confirmed that the quasicrystal originated in an extraterrestrial body that formed about 4.57 billion years ago , which is around the time our solar system formed ( artist 's illustration shown ) the researchers are now exploring how the mineral formed			0
‘ we know there was a meteor impact , and that the temperature was around 1,000 to 1,200 degrees @entity164 , and that the pressure was a hundred thousand times greater than atmospheric pressure , but that is not enough to tell us all the details , ’ said dr @entity33			0
‘ we 'd like to know whether the formation of quasicrystals is rare or is fairly frequent , how it occurs , and whether it could happen in other solar systems			0
‘ what we find out could answer basic questions about the materials found in our universe			1

scientists at @entity14 , @entity12 studied ancient meteorite
they found a second quasicrystal with a ' forbidden symmetry '
it was thought such material could not naturally occur in nature
@entity189 has a symmetry in which it should n't be possible for atoms to form
@entity194 could shed light on how these materials exist in the universe
