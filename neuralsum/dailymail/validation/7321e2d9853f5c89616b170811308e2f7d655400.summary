@entity0 has been reported to police by @entity3 mp @entity2 over claims she incited racial hatred in tweets linking @entity8 men to the @entity10 child sex abuse scandal outspoken former reality tv star @entity0 has accused the @entity3 mp @entity2 of reporting her to the police to deflect attention from being ' caught watching porn '			1
mr @entity2 said he had received death threats after asking @entity16 police commissioner @entity15 to investigate whether ms @entity0 had incited racial hatred in a series of tweets linking @entity8 men to the @entity10 child sex abuse scandal			1
ms @entity0 sent the tweets after mr @entity2 attended the raising of a @entity8 flag over the town hall for half an hour on march 23 to mark @entity8 's @entity24			1
ms @entity0 posted a series of messages to her account after the mp tweeted a picture of himself at the event			1
in response the controversial columnist sent a picture of eight men convicted of child exploitation offences , asking mr @entity2 if they were his friends too			1
mr @entity2 said the messages were ' inciting racial hatred '			2
he told @entity36 tonight that he had seen the police today and will do so again tomorrow and revealed he had received death threats as a result			1
ms @entity0 sounded unconcerned and said she laughed when she heard mr @entity2 had reported her to the police			1
she said she will stand up herself and ' defend the right of @entity43 people to have the @entity45 flag flying '			0
she added that mr @entity2 is ' wasting police time '			1
the businesswoman said mr @entity2 was just covering up the fact that he had been ' caught watching porn ' and because he has a wafer thin majority and ' needs the @entity8 vote '			1
it came after mr @entity2 this weekend confessed to watching pornography but insisted voters want politicians who ' live in the real world '			2
the husband of selfie - loving @entity59 was spotted favouriting hard - core porn on @entity61 - but blamed it on a fault with his @entity64			0
however , the 48 - year - old was unembarrassed about the gaffe			0
he stressed he does not use porn regularly , but insisted : ' i am a man of the world and it is part of life , many people do			0
' mr @entity2 tonight dismissed ms @entity0 ' claim that he had only reported her to cover up his embarrassment			1
but ms @entity0 said she stood by her comments saying : ' for me , in somewhere like @entity10 , you ca n't raise a @entity8 flag and talk about community cohesion in the same sentence			1
' ' if we look at why someone did n't call the police earlier when our white girls were being attacked by these gentlemen , if someone had called the police earlier then that would have been a good thing would n't it ? ' @entity0 is said to have started sending the tweets after mr @entity2 attended the raising of a @entity8 flag over the town hall for half an hour on march 23 to mark @entity8 's @entity24 mr @entity2 said @entity10 has faced up to the ' heinous crime ' of child grooming ' in a way that 's managed to keep our communities together '			1
he said : ' that 's why @entity0 ' crass comments are not helpful			2
they are a clear attempt to divide communities , undo three years of hard work and make an unfair and racist generalisation that anyone of @entity8 origin is a child abuser			2
' to equate the @entity8 flag with child abuse , as she has done on social media over the last week , is absurd and it creates a dangerous environment where extreme intolerance becomes acceptable			1
' we have already seen taxi drivers stabbed in the face in race hate attacks and i 'm not prepared to allow people like @entity0 , who know nothing about our town , to stir up tensions in such a dangerously provocative way that could lead to innocent people being attacked by extremists			2
' as a result of her comments last week , i have been threatened by extremists and hard right groups have pledged to march on our town			0
i am a strong supporter of free speech but it has to be responsible - and that 's why we have laws to prevent people deliberately provoking hatred of a racial group			0
' earlier this week ms @entity0 sparked outrage after being accused of making a @entity139 joke aimed at the wife of @entity141 – even though his @entity143 parents fled from the @entity145			2
' raising a @entity8 flag in @entity10 is not helping community cohesion , ' she added in another			1
@entity151 you & your party disgust me ' she wrote : ' are these your friends too ‪ @ @entity153 ? is this why you are raising the @entity8 flag in @entity10 ? 77 years inside ' the controversial tv pundit faced calls for her arrest after saying the @entity3 leader could ' gas ' his wife @entity160 in a message on friday			1
she tweeted : ' pollsters say @entity160 is the least popular of party wives			0
he might stick her head in the oven and turn on the gas			0
' the outspoken star was then bombarded with hundreds of furious messages condemning her ' vile ' tweet , with one saying : ' you really are a deplorable and scummy piece of excrement			0
' she has also courted controversy this week for her comments about the @entity178 disaster			0
the tv pundit tweeted saying : ' sympathy for the co-pilot is making me angry			0
if you are suicidal , for goodness sake top yourself in private			0
attention seeking b * * * * * * s. ' the controversial tv pundit faced calls for her arrest after saying the @entity3 leader could ' gas ' his wife @entity160 ( pictured together ) she followed this up with a number of tweets about depression , including : ' most depression is just genuine sadness at a social situation			2
