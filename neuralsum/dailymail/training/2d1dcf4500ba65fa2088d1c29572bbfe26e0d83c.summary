if food no longer smells appetising and perfume seems less pungent , you could be seriously ill. men and women who have lost their sense of smell are almost six times more likely as others to die within the next five years , a study found			1
the inability to identify fish , rose , leather , orange , and peppermint – the five scents used in the experiment – could predict death within five years , scientists said			1
while the finding may seem odd , a poor sense of smell raises the odds of death more than established medical conditions including cancer			1
file picture the @entity26 researchers said that while the dulling of the sense does not directly cause death , it provides ‘ early warning that something has gone badly wrong ’			1
they believe that a simple smell test could be used to identify pensioners most at risk of an early death			2
@entity42 researcher @entity41 said : ‘ of all the human senses , smell is the most undervalued and underappreciated – until it ’s gone			1
’ but @entity46 experts urged people not to panic – and said that much more research is needed to confirm the link			1
in the first study of its kind , more than 3,000 men and women aged between 57 and 85 were put through a three - minute smell test			0
they were asked to sniff the scent given off by felt tip - pen like gadgets and given four possible answers			0
they did this five times			0
the fragrances used were , in order of increasing difficulty , peppermint , fish , orange , rose and leather			0
the inability to identify fish , rose , leather , orange , and peppermint – the five scents used in the experiment – could predict death within five years , scientists said most of the men and women got at least four of the five right , meaning they had a normal sense of smell			1
almost 20 per cent only identified two or three of the smells – indicating a mild loss of the sense			2
some 3.5 per cent got one or none right – and were judged to be ‘ anosmic ’ – or to have lost their sense of smell			1
five years later , 430 of the men and women had died			0
those who had failed the smell test were almost six times as likely to have died as those with a healthy sense of smell , the journal @entity97 reports			1
the finding could be partly explained by age , gender and socio - economic status			0
but , even when these were taken into account , someone without a sense of smell was more than three times as likely to have died			1
the @entity26 researchers said that while the dulling of the sense does not directly cause death , it provides ‘ early warning that something has gone badly wrong ’ even a moderate loss of sense of smell raised the odds of an early death			1
what is more the link was n’t simply due to those with poor sense of smell having lost their appetite , or drinking or smoking more , having cancer or heart problems or being generally frail			1
in fact , not being able to smell things provides a more accurate warning of an early death than cancer or heart failure			2
only severe liver damage is more strongly linked to dying within five years			0
dr @entity41 said : ‘ we think that loss of sense of smell is like the canary in the coal mine			2
‘ it does n’t directly cause death , but it ’s a harbinger , an early warning that something has gone badly wrong			0
’ one possibility is that the health of the olfactory nerve , which carries information on smell from the nose to the brain , is a sign of overall health			0
if it has become old , worn and unable to repair itself , the brain and body may be in the same position			0
another possible explanation is that infections , poisons and pollutants that we breathe in damage our sense of smell before harming the brain and body			2
dr @entity41 said : ‘ pollution can affect heart , lung and brain disease , predisposing to early death			0
’ dr @entity169 , the study ’s senior author , said : ‘ this evolutionary ancient special sense may signal a key mechanism that affects human longevity			0
’ @entity174 , a consultant head and neck surgeon , described the research as interesting – but questioned the reliability of the smell test used			2
he would give a patient 40 different fragrances , rather than just five , to establish if they have lost their ability to identify smells			0
professor @entity174 , honorary secretary of @entity184 , the @entity46 association for ear , nose and throat specialists , added that people who are starting to lose their sense of smell should n’t panic			1
however , they should seek medical help as previous studies have linked the loss with the early stage of @entity197 ’s and @entity198 ’s diseases .			0

those who lose smell six times likely as others to die within next five years
a poor sense of smell raises the odds of death more than established medical conditions including cancer , say @entity42 researchers
but experts urged people not to panic – and said more research is needed
