@entity0 is on course to crush the @entity1 in the @entity2 and @entity3 by - election , according to a new poll last night			1
the @entity7 poll for the @entity8 gave @entity0 candidate @entity9 a 15 - point lead over his former party			1
the lead has widened by six points since an identical poll last month , and suggests that a huge @entity1 effort to hold the seat is failing to gain traction			2
former @entity1 mp @entity9 is on course to win the @entity2 and @entity3 by - election the poll puts support for @entity0 on 48 per cent , with the conservatives on 33 , @entity22 , who came second in 2010 , on 16 per cent , the @entity24 on two percent and the @entity25 on just one per cent			1
@entity0 ’s vote has risen by eight points since last month , while the @entity28 and @entity25 have both fallen by two points and @entity22 ’s support has slumped by nine			2
the development is a serious setback to @entity33 , who has pledged to ‘ throw the kitchen sink ’ at the attempt to hold the seat , in a bid to halt the @entity0 surge			1
it comes amid warnings that the prime minister could face a leadership challenge if the @entity1 fail to win			1
former leadership contender @entity43 was yesterday reported to be taking soundings about a possible plot to depose mr @entity33 if the seat is lost			2
mr @entity43 , who could not be contacted for comment yesterday , is said to have told fellow @entity48 that there is a ‘ window ’ of opportunity to organise a vote of no confidence in mr @entity33 between the 20 november by - election and @entity56 , if rebels act quickly			1
mr @entity33 yesterday tried to steady the ship by summoning his mps to an away day in @entity60 to discuss how to get back on the front foot			0
mps were told that @entity63 plans to use next month ’s @entity64 to ram home the @entity28 successful record on the @entity67			0
it comes amid warnings the prime minister could face a leadership challenge if the @entity1 fail to win and @entity1 strategist @entity72 told @entity48 that the party could still win next year because of @entity75 ’s unpopularity			1
but one mp who stayed away , warned that the @entity1 leadership was underestimating the threat posed by the current situation			0
‘ i did n’t go , because i thought i was better off putting in a day ’s campaigning			0
the message is always the same – @entity22 are so hopeless that we are going to somehow pull things out of the fire			0
it ’s just like 1996			0
’ the prime minister was rocked earlier last month by the @entity87 by - election , where @entity1 defector @entity89 crushed his former party to become @entity0 ’s first elected mp			1
a second defeat by @entity0 would be a body blow to mr @entity33 just six months out from the @entity94			1
@entity0 leader @entity95 is predicting that more mps will defect to the @entity98 party if mr @entity9 wins , sparking further debilitating by - elections			2
mr @entity9 enraged the @entity1 leadership when he defected to @entity0 on the eve of the @entity1 conference			2
senior @entity28 were initially confident they could hold the seat , and @entity1 mps were ordered to campaign in the @entity106 constituency at least five times			0
at the 2010 election mr @entity9 took @entity2 and @entity3 for the conservatives with a majority of almost 10,000 over @entity22			0
@entity0 did not stand in the seat last time			0
@entity1 sources acknowledge they have flooded the constituency with leaflets since mr @entity9 quit			0
this has included a personal letter from mr @entity33 to every home in the constituency inviting voters to take part in an ‘ open primary ’ election to select @entity1 candidate @entity122			1
but @entity0 has also piled huge resources into the fight and appears to be picking up votes from across the political spectrum .			0
