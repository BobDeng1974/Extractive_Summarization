by @entity0 take a look at a map today , and you ’re likely to see that @entity5 is larger than @entity6 , @entity1 is larger than @entity7 and @entity8 is smaller than @entity9			1
but in reality @entity8 is four times bigger than @entity9 , @entity6 is three times bigger than @entity5 and @entity7 is larger than @entity1			1
the distortion is the result of the @entity20 projection , the map most commonly seen hanging in classrooms and in text books , which was created in 1596 to help sailors navigate the world			1
the @entity20 projection , the map most commonly seen hanging in classrooms and in text books , was created in 1596 to help sailors navigate the world			1
the familiar map gives the right shapes of land masses , but at the cost of distorting their sizes in favour of the wealthy lands to the north you might think that the advent of satellite imagery and tools such as @entity37 has improved our view of the world , but this is n’t necessarily the case , according to @entity41 writing in the @entity42			1
much of this is due to technical reasons , said mr @entity41 , while others inconsistences are caused by ideological assumptions that can change the way we see the world			0
the biggest challenge is that it is impossible to portray the reality of the spherical world on a flat map – a problem that has haunted cartographers for centuries			1
one of the best alternatives to the @entity20 projection was presented in 1974 by @entity58 ( pictured )			2
the @entity60 projection makes seeing the relative size of places much easier			0
however it also has its flaws as certain places appear stretched , horizontally near the poles and vertically near the @entity67 a depiction of the world by @entity70			0
it 's said that @entity72 used this map or one like it to persuade @entity74 and @entity75 to support him in the early 1490s			0
the map was made by a @entity78 cartographer living in @entity79 and reflects the latest theories about the form of the world and the most accurate ways of portraying it on a flat surface @entity6 is around 14 times larger than @entity9 and yet on the map both are almost same size			1
@entity88 is more than five times larger than @entity1 , yet @entity1 is larger than @entity88 on the map			2
the map suggests that @entity93 countries are larger than @entity94 , whereas in reality @entity94 is three times the size of all @entity93 countries put together			1
while it looks like @entity101 is larger than @entity5 on this map , in reality the reverse is true			1
@entity103 also is n't as large as it is depicted , with @entity6 larger than @entity103 in reality			1
as a result , shapes of world maps have typically been diverse , ranging from hearts to cones			2
but the diversity gradually faded away with one model , invented by @entity20 , surpassing the others			2
the familiar ' @entity20 ' projection gives the right shapes of land masses , but at the cost of distorting their sizes in favour of the wealthy lands to the north			1
for instance , in the @entity20 projection , @entity5 looks at least as big , if not slightly larger , than @entity6			1
and @entity9 also looks of comparable size			1
but in reality @entity6 is larger than both			1
in fact , you can fit @entity5 into @entity6 and still have space for @entity94 , @entity130 , @entity131 and some left over , notes mr @entity41			1
@entity9 , meanwhile , is 1/14th the size of the continent as can be seen in @entity60 equal projection , which provides the correct proportion of land mass to the continents			2
the map suggests that @entity93 countries are larger than @entity94 , whereas in reality @entity94 is three times the size of all @entity93 countries put together			1
as well , as this , it seems the fact that our maps typically put north at the top is a mere convention but has been accepted as correct in most of the world			2
looking back , the diversity of maps can reveal a history of the world			0
the @entity154 which was made for the @entity155 in 1623			0
the creators exaggerated the size of @entity8 and placed it in the middle of a world that otherwise consisted mainly of small offshore islands the @entity163 heart - shaped project of the world ( left ) the fact that our maps typically put north at the top is a mere convention but has been accepted as correct in most of the world			2
pictured on the right is a @entity20 map turned on its head for instance , the ‘ @entity172 ! ’ map was created in 1921 when infant @entity174 was threatened with invasion , famine and social unrest			1
to counter this , designers such as @entity179 were employed to create @entity182 propaganda			0
using a map of @entity103 and its neighbours , @entity186 's image of a heroic @entity188 guard defeating the invading ' whites ' helped define the @entity174 in the @entity191 popular imagination			0
an earlier map , called the @entity193 , created in 1623 reveals the ancient @entity8 view of the world			2
made for the @entity155 , this is the earliest known @entity8 terrestrial globe , and a fusion of @entity199 and @entity200 cultures			0
the creators exaggerated the size of @entity8 and placed it in the middle of a world that otherwise consisted mainly of small off ¬ shore islands			0
a century earlier , the 1507 @entity207 map named and envisaged @entity5 as a separate continent for the first time			2
photo of a genuine hand drawn world map , it was drawn in 1844 and therefore the countries are named as they were in that period			2
the biggest challenge is that it is impossible to portray the reality of the spherical world on a flat map perhaps to emphasise the independent existence of the @entity223 , the map shows what we now know is the @entity226 lapping the western coast of @entity228 , though its existence was only confirmed years late			1
in 2005 , @entity230 presented a world in which the area of most concern to the used could be at the centre , and which - with mapped content overlaid - can contain whatever you think is important			0
almost for the first time , the ability to create an accurate map has been placed in the hands of everyone , and it has transformed the way we view the world			0
but it comes at a price			0
there are few , if any , agreed standards about what should be included , and the less populated and ' less important ' regions get ignored			0
the infant @entity174 was threatened with invasion , famine and social unrest			0
to counter this , brilliant designers such as @entity179 were employed to create @entity182 propaganda			0
using a map of @entity103 and its neighbours , @entity186 's image of a heroic @entity188 guard defeating the invading ' whites ' helped define the @entity174 in the @entity191 popular imagination @entity37 claims that it is on a ' never - ending quest for the perfect map ' , but @entity266 , historian of cartography and the author of @entity269 in @entity270 , is n't so sure a @entity20 map created in 1569			1
in the @entity20 projection , @entity5 looks at least as big , if not slightly larger , than @entity6			1
and @entity9 also looks of comparable size today , billions of searches are made on @entity37 each day , helping people navigate their way around , streets , towns and countries			1
@entity37 claims that it is on a ‘ never - ending quest for the perfect map ’ , but @entity266 , historian of cartography and the author of @entity269 in @entity270 , is n’t so sure			0
he argues that all maps are of their time , their place and serve certain purposes			0
‘ no world map is , or can be , a definitive , transparent depiction of its subject that offers a disembodied eye onto the world , ’ he writes			0
‘ each one is a continual negotiation between its makers and users , as their understanding of the world changes			0
’ this map was used in 1782 by @entity301 diplomats negotiating an end to the @entity303 in @entity304			0
@entity305 , secretary to the delegation , annotated it with coloured lines to show where it was thought past treaties established the @entity314 / @entity313 border			0

the distortion is the result of the @entity20 map which was created in 1596 to help sailors navigate the world
it gives the right shapes of countries but at the cost of distorting sizes in favour of the wealthy lands to the north
for instance , @entity5 looks larger , or at least as big , as @entity6 , and @entity9 also looks of comparable size
in reality , you can fit @entity5 into @entity6 and still have space for @entity94 , @entity130 , @entity131 and some left over
@entity338 suggests @entity93 countries are larger than @entity94 , whereas in reality @entity94 is three times the size
the biggest challenge for cartographers is that it is impossible to portray reality of spherical world on a flat map
