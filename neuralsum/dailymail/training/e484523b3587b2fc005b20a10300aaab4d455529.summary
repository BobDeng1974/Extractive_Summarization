by @entity1 reporter published : 17:21 est , 2 september 2012 updated : 02:25 est , 3 september 2012 if it took a year and ten months to build the warship @entity4 in the 17th century , how long would it take to make a 1:84 scale model today ? the answer , astonishingly , is two years and seven months – nine months longer than shipwrights took over the original , which was the largest vessel of her time			1
it will also cost £ 804.65 for 135 issues of a new weekly magazine showing how to create the 110cm - long replica of the wooden @entity17 ship commissioned by @entity18 and launched in 1637			1
readers will have to buy 135 issues if they want to build the entire ship the magazine will be launched at an introductory price of £ 1.99 but will cost £ 5.99 thereafter the magazine – which has been widely advertised on tv – costs £ 1.99 for the first issue , then £ 5.99 per copy after that			1
its website says : ‘ @entity30 is a new magazine that comes complete with all the parts to build a stunning model of the most powerful warship of the 17th century			1
’ but a spokesman for pressure group @entity35 said : ‘ the cost of these magazines can really mount up			1
‘ before taking on a long - running subscription to make a ship or anything else , people should work out the final cost and decide whether they feel that is worth paying			2
’ the magazine series includes detailed images showing how to put together the masts , rigging , guns and anchors			1
the first edition details the origins of the ship in @entity52 and includes a cannon and the first parts of the hull			1

@entity57 of @entity58 , who has run his model ship - making website for ten years , said you could buy a similar model ready - made for around £ 300			2
he added : ‘ enthusiasts can buy a complete @entity65 kit from a shop and complete it in a few months			2
’ @entity30 cost £ 65,586 when it was built which is the equivalent of £ 8million today a spokesman for @entity70 , the firm behind the magazine , said : ‘ this type of partwork provides for a niche modelling audience a very high - quality model in easy to manage parts			1
it is a tried and tested formula much appreciated by our loyal modelling fans and allows @entity70 to create and develop beautiful ships to a degree of detail and scale that is not normally available in the @entity85			0
’ @entity4 was the most magnificent ship of her era , with no expense spared during her construction			0
the £ 65,586 cost is the equivalent of around £ 8million today			0
she was the first ship to have three full gun decks , carrying 102 guns on the orders of the @entity97 , instead of the 90 originally planned			0
all her guns were made from bronze instead of cast iron , which meant they were much lighter but four times more expensive			0
@entity4 was known by @entity105 ’s enemies as the @entity106 because of her stunning black and gold colouring			0
her first engagement was the @entity110 , fought in the @entity111 during the @entity112 in september 1652			0
