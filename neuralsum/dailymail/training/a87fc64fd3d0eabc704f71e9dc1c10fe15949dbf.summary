remarkable intervention : @entity1 said feminism was partly to blame for damaging the family feminism is partly to blame for the breakdown of the family , one of @entity6 ’s most senior female politicians has said			1
@entity1 , the party ’s public health spokesman , said that major issues facing society ‘ stem from family breakdown ’			1
and in a surprise admission from one of the @entity18 ’s most outspoken feminists , she conceded that women ’s rights campaigners have neglected the family			0
miss @entity1 , a divorced mother with one son , also highlighted the harmful impact on society of internet pornography and fast food			0
perhaps most surprising , however , is her argument that left - wingers and feminists should make family breakdown a key battleground rather than leave the issue to conservatives			2
in an interview with @entity34 , she said : ‘ those of us who came of age at the height of feminism had very mixed views about the family , since it seemed to be defined as a heterosexual thing with a certificate , children and mum at home			2
’ but she said the @entity18 had to recognise that ‘ some of the biggest public health issues stem from family breakdown ’ , explaining : ‘ doctors say to me that so many of the drug and alcohol problems they see stem from family difficulties			1
’ in a nod to @entity6 orthodoxy , miss @entity1 said : ‘ when i talk about stable families , i do not only mean the heterosexual , 2.1 - children set - up , but also extended families or same - sex relationships			2
’ but she added : ‘ i still believe some kind of stable family structure is vital and that is what most people want around them			1
i do not think we should abandon that terrain to the @entity69			0
’ miss @entity1 ’s intervention is remarkable since it echoes the views of work and pensions secretary @entity72			1
miss @entity1 , who stood for the @entity6 leadership in 2010 , said local authorities should have stronger powers to ban the spread of fried chicken shops and other fast food outlets , adding : ‘ for too many children , fast food is not a treat but a dietary staple			2
’ miss @entity1 recognised that ' some of the biggest public health issues stem from family breakdown ' advice : miss @entity1 also said local authorities should have stronger powers to ban fast food outlets surprising : the @entity6 mp 's views echo those of @entity90 secretary @entity72 miss @entity1 also threw her support behind @entity94 mp @entity93 ’s crusade to introduce controls on viewing internet pornography			1
‘ children very young , ten or 11 , can go online and see stuff they could not have bought in a newsagent 20 years ago , ’ she said			0
‘ this crude pornification is new , and leads to the objectification of the human body , especially girls ’ bodies			0
’ miss @entity1 also said she had come to support school uniforms – traditionally opposed by the @entity18 – to combat the modern obsession with designer brands			0
she said : ‘ there are these young mums that do not necessarily read to their children , they do not take them to the library , but they think they are good mums because their children are dressed in brand names from top to bottom			0

the @entity6 mp said big issues facing society ' stem from family breakdown '
added that ' some kind of stable family structure is vital ' and what most want
her intervention echoes the views of @entity94 mp @entity72
