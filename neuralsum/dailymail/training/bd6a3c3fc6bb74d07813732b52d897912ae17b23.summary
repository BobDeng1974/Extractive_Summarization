a government - funded project is being launched to combat malnourishment among the elderly			1
one million people over the age of 65 in @entity6 suffer from or are at risk of malnutrition , according to the charity @entity9 , which makes them more susceptible to poor health			1
the project aims to increase diagnosis and treatment of the condition , and improve care and support for older people to stop them ' slipping through the net '			1
health risk : age @entity9 warned that a million over- 65s are at risk of malnourishment , which can lead to ill - health more generally , and make it harder for people to recover from hospital treatment the @entity26 is being piloted in five areas of the country			1
projects in @entity30 and @entity31 in @entity32 , and @entity33 , @entity34 , will begin in january			0
hospitals , gp practices and care homes will work with community groups to reach the elderly at risk			2
the project will focus on those who have a low body mass index , are underweight , or who lose weight without trying			0
it will also target dehydration , which is often linked to malnutrition			0
volunteers and professionals will raise awareness the symptoms among , and help those affected to take action			0
the project is funded by the @entity56 and run by the @entity57			0
the group of experts , which includes @entity9 , was set up last year to address preventable malnutrition and dehydration in older people			1
it is part of the government 's response to the @entity66 into the @entity68 scandal , which revealed that patients , many of them older , were unable able to eat or drink properly and that nutrition was not treated as a priority			1
research has shown that 93 per cent of malnourished older people are living in the community , @entity9 said			1
yet the condition often goes undiagnosed or untreated because of the incorrect belief that a smaller appetite and losing weight is a normal part of ageing			0
people who are malnourished experience increased ill - health , hospital admissions and risk of infections			1
it also takes them longer to recover from surgery , the experts behind the project say			2
when compared with well - nourished people , those who were malnourished see their gp twice as often , have three times the number of hospital admissions and stay in hospital more than three days longer			1
problems : @entity97 was a serious issue at hospitals , including @entity101 hospital , caught up in the @entity102			0
the investigation found many older people were unable able to eat or drink properly and that their nutrition was a priority			1
one in three older people are already at risk of malnutrition when they arrive at hospital , making speedy recovery from other conditions more difficult			1
in addition , 37 per cent of older people who have recently moved into care homes are at risk of malnutrition			1
@entity115 , chairman of the @entity57 and of @entity9 , said : ' eating and drinking properly is critical to being healthy and remaining independent			2
yet malnutrition goes untreated and diagnosed in nearly one million older people in @entity6			2
' we hope that by working closely with hospitals , gp surgeries and care homes we can tackle this hidden problem and help ensure that older people do not slip through the net			2
' health minister @entity124 added : ' many people think of malnutrition as a problem that only affects the @entity128			0
but the reality is that over three million people in the @entity9 have the potential to become malnourished - many of whom are frail and elderly			1
' action must be taken , and that is why we 're teaming up with @entity9 and funding the first stage of its campaign			2
damning : the new @entity140 initiative is part of a response to a report by @entity144 , who led the @entity146 ' carers and @entity149 staff will be better equipped to identify , tackle and prevent malnutrition - so older people get better care and receive more support in their own homes and communities			1
' around 13,000 people a year are admitted to hospital while suffering from malnutrition , and that is something that needs to change			0
' it is hoped the scheme will be expanded to tackle malnutrition nationally			0
@entity161 , of @entity162 , said the charity believes that one in 10 people over 65 suffer from malnutrition , meaning about 2,500 people in @entity30			0
mr @entity161 told @entity166 the project can work if the health side of care is integrated with community - based support , which would help protect the health service from increased emergency admissions from malnutrition			0
he said the @entity162 pilot might involve a ' social prescription ' that would involve advice on exercise and healthy eating			0
' older people go for regular health checks and the idea is that when they get the prescription they get some information on nutrition and exercise , ' mr @entity161 said			2
' we would like the @entity186 to refer them to us			0
we can give them an adviser who will pair them up with people locally who will befriend them and volunteer to go shopping and things like that			0

age @entity9 warns elderly who eat too little are at *greater* risk of *disease*
they also need more hospital visits and take longer on average to recover
new government - backed initiative aims to increase diagnosis and treatment of malnourishment
response comes in the wake of the @entity68 scandal , where many older people were left without food or water while they were treated in hospital
