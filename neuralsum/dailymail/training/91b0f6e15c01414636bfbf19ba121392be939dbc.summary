the search for a cure to the common cold came a step closer yesterday – thanks to the common cod. a unique enzyme found in the @entity9 species of the fish has the ability to trap the cold virus and stop it in its tracks , scientists claim			1
they have now adapted the enzyme , called trypsin , into a mouth spray that reduced the spread of the virus in clinical trials by 99 per cent – effectively curing it			1
scientists have made a spray using an enzyme found in cod that halved the average number of days that people suffered from the common cold the unique enzyme found in the @entity9 species of the fish has the ability to trap the cold virus and stop it in its tracks , scientists claim the spray works by forming an invisible barrier in the mouth and throat , which stops the virus being taken up by human cells and multiplying			1
the trials showed that the spray – made by @entity38 – also halved the average number of days those who caught a cold had symptoms from 6.5 to three days			1
dr @entity42 , head of research and development at @entity45 , said the remedy had been five years in the making , adding : ‘ it is pretty revolutionary			0
‘ the common cold is a virus which binds to the mucus membranes of the nose , mouth and eyes			2
it is taken up by human cells and multiplies			0
‘ once someone is infected , the virus moves to the throat area , where the first symptoms are a sore throat around 20 hours after the virus takes hold			0
' the spray works because the enzyme forms a temporary , invisible barrier on the membranes preventing the virus being taken up			2
' the enzyme does n’t kill the virus , it effectively disarms it because it stops it being taken up with human cells , so the cold and its symptoms ca n’t progress			2
’ @entity72 , which is found in the pancreas of deep - sea cod , becomes more efficient at body temperature , making it very effective at stopping the virus when it comes into contact with skin or other tissue			0
the spray , known as @entity85 , costs from £ 9.99 for a 7ml bottle and is being sold by boots from this month .			0

an enzyme found in @entity9 cod can stop the cold virus from spreading
scientists have adapted the unique *chemical* into a mouth spray
it can reduce the number of days people suffer from cold symptoms by half
