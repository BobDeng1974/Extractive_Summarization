by @entity0 published : 14:39 est , 7 march 2014 updated : 20:59 est , 7 march 2014 the mysterious woman branded the ' vamp in the veil ' has spoken out about her @entity7 battle ' hell ' the so - called ‘ vamp in a veil ’ , accused of scamming a pair of property developers out of luxury flats worth £ 14million , could now face deportation for giving immigration officials a false identity			1
@entity16 , who is also accused of posing as a @entity18 royal and has variously claimed to be 31 and 43 , has lived in @entity19 for more than ten years after she was granted refugee status			1
according to her ‘ victims ’ @entity21 and @entity22 , miss @entity16 was a penniless @entity24 prostitute who posed as a @entity18 princess to swindle them out of a property empire			1
high court judge @entity28 recently ruled miss @entity16 could keep the flats , saying her true identity was irrelevant to the case			2
but remarkably , the judge admitted : ‘ the exact identity of ms @entity16 remains unknown			2
’ buried in her lengthy judgement , however , was the revelation that miss @entity16 was an asylum seeker who was granted refugee status by the @entity38			0
and in a twist that will embarrass immigration judges , judge @entity28 ruled : ‘ had it been necessary , i would have found that ms @entity16 ’s father is not the person stated in the documents produced for the @entity38			1
’ her refugee status has to be periodically reviewed , and she has not yet been awarded a @entity19 passport			0
now she could be belatedly deported because officials may not have been told the truth about her identity			1
her daughter @entity50 , 13 , was born here however , meaning she would be able to argue the right to remain to preserve her ‘ right to a family life ’			0
property developers @entity21 and @entity22 claimed they temporarily signed six flats in @entity55 over to @entity56 , but that no payment was forthcoming above , from left : @entity59 , a less - modestly dressed @entity60 , former table dancer @entity61 and @entity63 ' @entity62 , pictured at a @entity65 nightclub miss @entity16 has used her @entity38 identity card to help raise a huge loan from the @entity69 bank			0
while in the country , she has been forced to answer allegations not only that she was a prostitute posing as a princess for an elaborate fraud , but also that she snorted cocaine and the horse tranquilliser ketamine on champagne - fuelled nights out			1
she angrily denies being a prostitute , and claims her @entity80 faith requires her to hide her face with a veil			2
according to the @entity7 judgment , miss @entity16 apparently first applied for asylum in march 2002 , claiming that her father was ‘ from a powerful business family in @entity18 who owns amongst other things , the @entity88 and the @entity89 in @entity24 ’			1
mrs @entity90 accepted @entity56 's claim that she was having a secret affair with mr @entity22 , 45 , behind the back of his long - term girlfriend , and that the flats were repayment for millions she lent him while @entity56 denied presenting herself as a princess as part of the scam , the judge noted that she has bodyguards and ' travels in a black @entity104 , part of the registration number of which is " hrh " ' judge @entity28 recorded that in court miss @entity16 had accepted that two different @entity18 billionaires named in previous documents given to the @entity38 and banks as her father were not related to her , and blamed her lawyers or others searching on the internet for mistakenly using their names			2
the @entity38 has repeatedly refused to discuss miss @entity16 ’s refugee status , saying she is entitled to privacy			0
yesterday miss @entity16 continued to deny prostitution claims , and maintained she faced execution in @entity18			0
she said : ‘ this country is bad sometimes , the way they portray @entity80 women			0
‘ but i also love this country because it saved me			0

despite winning her £ 14m @entity7 battle , @entity127 was accused of being a penniless @entity24 prostitute posing as an @entity131 princess
now it has *emerged* she lied about her identity on immigration documents
she could be deported for *misleading* officials about who she really was
@entity140 has branded claims made about her as ' *sexist* and racist ' and revealed that she had been *criticised* in the street by strangers and spat at
