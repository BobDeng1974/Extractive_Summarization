love birds : these swans appeared to be coming over all romantic as they formed a perfect heart shape at the @entity13 in @entity14 home to a colony of around 600 nesting @entity29 , the @entity26 was originally set up by the @entity32 monks who built their monastery at @entity13 during the 1040s			1
originally the swans were farmed to produce food for the monks ' lavish banquets , and when the monastery was destroyed by @entity39 in 1539 , they @entity26 came under the stewardship of @entity41 , which still oversees it today			2
unlike most @entity45 swans , these are not owned by the @entity46 as they were sold by @entity39 to sir @entity48 , @entity49			2
heart to heart : the birds are among the 600 who live at the @entity26 , which is the world 's only only managed colony of @entity29			1
the sanctuary is home to the world 's only managed colony of @entity29			1
as well as being a popular tourist destination the @entity26 is also popular with film makers due to its natural wildlife habitat , and was used as a location for @entity64			2
every july the swans moulting feathers renders them flightless for around six weeks , anabling them to be rounded up , weighed and measured			0
any swans that are new to the colony are ringed as part of the round - up , which involves around 50 canoes driving the birds into a lagoon where they are checked over and given inoculations before being released back into the wild			0
