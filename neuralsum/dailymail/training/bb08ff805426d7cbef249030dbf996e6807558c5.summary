by @entity0 published : 06:40 est , 16 august 2012 updated : 09:01 est , 16 august 2012 podiatrist @entity1 told to leave his local @entity3 store after a security guard stopped him entering a podiatrist who walks everywhere in his bare feet was banned from his local branch of @entity3 for refusing to wear shoes			1
@entity9 , 48 , believes walking without footwear is good for posture and general health and says shoes are unnecessary			1
he has been walking everywhere barefoot for the last two years but was stunned when a security guard stopped him entering his local @entity3 in @entity15 , @entity16			1
the manager intervened and explained the policy was in place in case anyone injured themselves walking around the shop			0
but father - of - four mr @entity9 criticised the rule : ' i should be able to be responsible enough to look after my bare feet as well as a guide dog does			2
' it ’s the healthiest way to walk and it strengthens your feet and connects you to the environment			0
' i would like to see that there ’s no discrimination and people are given the option of going barefoot			0
' mr @entity9 is a qualified podiatrist of 27 years experience and runs the @entity38 in @entity15			1
he believes feet are much healthier without shoes and by going barefoot people can improve general health			2
mr @entity9 claims his foot hygiene is better than those who wear shoes and that people wearing flip - flops or high heels are more likely to have an accident			1
he said his two boys , @entity51 , 12 and @entity52 , 19 , do not have a problem with going barefoot and often do it themselves , with @entity52 even going barefoot at @entity55			0
mr @entity9 said : ' when i first started going barefoot everyone thought i was mad , but now they have accepted it and see it as acceptable as bare hands			1
' people do not have to go around wearing gloves to cover up their hands so i do n’t see why people should cover their feet			1
let him back in ! @entity67 manager @entity66 with podiatrist @entity68 who was banned from walking barefoot in the @entity3 store in @entity15 , @entity16 ' people are not offended if they see others wearing flip flops and that is just a piece of cord on their feet , but as soon as the feet are bare people generally do not like it			1
' i have always thought that people needed to wear shoes as they can support your feet up to 80 per cent			0
' however , then i read a book named @entity83 and it was about a barefoot runner			0
after reading it i did a bit of research about barefoot walking and running and liked what i read			0
' amazingly , mr @entity9 said he has never had any injuries from going barefoot , and has only encountered a few splinters			1
he has been shopping barefoot at the @entity3 branch for years without incident but was suddenly blocked by a security guard on august 5			1
mr @entity9 explained : ' when i got banned from @entity3 i was pretty shocked , i had been going there for two years and spent hundreds of pounds			1
' the security officer basically said there was glass everywhere and did n’t want me to end up suing @entity3			2
' he went and got the manager - they were both very pleasant and agreed with me that it should not be an issue but they have a regional policy in case somebody claims against them for accidental damage			0
' but if you ’re barefoot you ’re more aware of your surroundings			0
i asked if they had a similar policy to ban guide dogs and they do n’t ban toddlers from walking around with their hands on the floor			0
' i think quite a lot of people in this part of the world go barefoot as there is a very outside way of life here			0
' the father claims that people wearing flip - flops or high heels were more likely to have an accident , whereas he is more aware of his surroundings however mr @entity9 , who also has two daughters @entity133 , 15 and @entity134 , 18 , launched an appeal against the decision by @entity3			1
after a ten - day period bosses agreed to make an exception to their barefoot policy and allow him back into the store			2
a spokesman for @entity3 said : ' we do tend to ask customers to put footwear on during the summer months , as a lot of them come straight from the beach and we want to stop sand spreading through the store			2
' but we try to take a common sense approach and are happy to make an exception in mr @entity9 ’s case			0
' mr @entity9 said he would continue to campaign for anybody to be able to enter the store without shoes .			2
