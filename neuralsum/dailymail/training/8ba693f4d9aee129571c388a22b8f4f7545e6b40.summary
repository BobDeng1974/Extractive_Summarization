by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent millions of people who pay their energy bills by direct debit are set to receive refunds , it will be announced today			1
power firms have caved in to pressure from ministers and will hand back money to householders who are in credit on their gas and electricity			1
it follows criticism that the @entity17 are making millions in interest by hoarding money they make when people pay too much during the year			1
action : millions of people who pay their energy bills by direct debit are set to receive refunds , it has been revealed			1
power firms will hand back money to householders who are in credit on their gas and electricity but one of the big companies – npower – has said it may not follow the other firms in refunding its customers			1
energy minister @entity34 said householders may wish to ‘ vote with their feet ’ and switch suppliers if npower refuses to follow suit			1
the energy firms will announce that they will make annual automatic refunds on balances which are more than £ 5 in credit , as well as reviewing customer accounts every six months			2
' excellent result ' : energy minister @entity34 said the move is ' a good step towards restoring trust in the majority of companies ' the move comes after an investigation found that power firms are stockpiling up to £ 2billion of cash from customers			1
with more than 13million households paying a fixed amount every month , many are overpaying in the summer , when usage is lower – leading to huge credits on accounts			0
industry experts estimated firms were making up to £ 36million a year in interest , leading to accusations that they were profiteering from customers			2
following anger from consumers , the companies held a summit with ministers in november , at which they promised to make changes including a refund if an account was in credit by £ 75 or more			0
further negotiation led to the amount being reduced to £ 5 , which @entity79 revealed on friday ahead of the expected joint announcement today			0
mr @entity34 said : ‘ this is an excellent result for consumers worried about energy prices , and this is a good step towards restoring trust in the majority of companies			1

it is their money at the end of the day			0
a spokesman for npower , which has 3.5million customers in the @entity102 , said : ‘ we ’re looking at this suggestion but we need to be sure it reflects what our customers want			0
opting out ? however , npower has said it may not follow the other firms in refunding its customers ( file picture ) ‘ our research strongly suggests customers want to be given a choice between a full refund today and keeping their direct debit payments down tomorrow			2
‘ we ’ve had feedback that refunding very low amounts is n’t seen as worthwhile , and we also know many people like to keep their account in credit , as a buffer for next year ’s bills			2
‘ however , we do automatically refund credit balances of over £ 60 , and customers in credit can request and receive a refund at any time			0
