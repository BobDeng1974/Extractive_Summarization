the 24 - year - old 's first match in @entity53 was hard work against @entity18 rising star @entity10 , who three years ago was controversially asked by the @entity62 to sit out of the @entity57 junior event due to her weight			1
but @entity10 has put that behind her to climb into the top 100 and she further showed her future promise by providing a stiff challenge for @entity0 on the @entity70			1

you saw yesterday how many seeds went out			0
you always know that first one , maybe it 's not going to be that comfortable			0

i 'm happy to be through and on to the next one			0

she 's won here before			0
it 's not the easiest on paper			0
