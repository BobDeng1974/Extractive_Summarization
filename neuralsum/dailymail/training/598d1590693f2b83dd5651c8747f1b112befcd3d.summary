people 's brains are slower to realise when they have done something wrong than right , scientists say while most of us are happy to take the credit when things go well , few of us are willing to take the blame when things go awry			1
now scientists have figured out why			2
rather than trying to hide our shame or embarrassment , experts found we are simply less aware when our actions result in a negative outcome			1
our brains take longer to associate our actions with a bad result , according to the study , and our perception of such events are more remote			2
the research may explain why we often feel it hard to take the blame for our actions			2
‘ our result suggests that people may really experience less responsibility for negative than for positive outcomes , ’ said lead researcher professor @entity24 of the @entity25 at @entity26			1
‘ this is not merely a retrospective justification about how well we have done : the actual experience that we have changes , even in basic aspects like its timing			2
’ in a series of tests , participants were asked to press a key			0
a sound then followed , either disapproving , neutral or approving , and they were then asked to estimate the time between the action and when they had heard the sound			0
researchers found individuals experienced different levels of responsibility depending on the outcome			0
they also discovered they were significantly slower to recognise if their actions had resulted in a bad consequence , compared to when they had done well			0
‘ effectively we have found that we experience a negative outcome differently , not just retell it differently			1
we make a weaker connection when there is a bad result , and respond much more strongly when something good happens , ’ said professor @entity24			0
‘ everybody who has worked in a team , will recognise the scenario			0
when something goes right , everyone want to take credit and when things go wrong , nobody is interested in putting their hand up			0
’ researchers at the @entity25 at @entity26 found participants experienced different levels of responsibility depending on whether what they did was right of wrong the researchers said our brain is ‘ very much concerned ’ with reward as biologically good results are key to survival			1
but they warned that although our own perception of culpability is altered by the outcome , this does not provide a defence if we have done something wrong			0
‘ this mechanism may well explain why some people do things and do n’t fell as responsible as they should , ’ said professor @entity24			1
‘ our experience of our own responsibilities can be misleading and can be strongly coloured by the outcomes of our actions			1
‘ but the way we experience an outcome is not the same as the facts of the event			1
we have to take responsibility for what we actually do , not just for how we experience things			0
