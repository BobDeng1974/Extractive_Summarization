residents in @entity1 are bracing themselves for another round of catastrophic flooding after the area 's main river rose to a dangerous level , amid warnings of a ' conveyor belt ' of winter storms			1
heavy rain has caused the @entity11 at @entity12 , near @entity13 , to rise by a staggering two metres , leaving it just one metre away from bursting its banks			2
the perilously - high levels caused the water to spill over into dozens of gardens , just 11 months since the last major flooding incident in @entity1			1
it comes less than two weeks after the @entity22 finished dredging two of the area 's rivers in an attempt to prevent future flooding			2
the project was started after the heaviest january rainfall for 250 years flooded the @entity61 , forcing thousands of people to flee their homes			0
but residents were sand - bagging their homes , after forecasters warned heavy rain and fierce winds of up to 70mph could batter the @entity68 - especially the south west			1
forecasters have warned that a spiralling 3,000 - mile diameter weather front , which brought downpours to the @entity68 this morning , will continue to sweep in from the @entity73 , bringing wet weather misery and gale - force winds until at least sunday			1
the bleak - looking forecast has led to severe weather warnings being put in place across large parts of @entity68 , with the south west of @entity81 , south @entity82 and parts of @entity84 expected to suffer the worst			1
forecasters say gusts of up to 70mph are expected to sweep across the @entity87 , potentially wreaking havoc as they hit the mainland			1
and they have also warned people to be on their guard for flooding all over the country , due to the onslaught of ' persistent ' rain expected over the past few days			2
residents began sand - bagging their homes as forecasters issued severe weather warnings across parts of the @entity68 , including @entity99 meteorologists have warned people to be on their guard for flooding all over the country , due to the onslaught of ' persistent ' rain expected and even though there will be a brief let - up early next week , a second weather front will reach the @entity68 on wednesday , pushing rain over and southern @entity68 again and presenting problems for residents in @entity1 a car drives over the bridge , as the @entity11 continues to rise to a very high level , blocking off the arch to the bridge dredging has been taking place since march , as part of a Â£ 5.8million plan to clear a five mile stretch of the nearby tone and @entity11 rivers the project is a bid to increase the capacity of the rivers , and reduce the risk of them overflowing during periods of heavy rainfall but , despite the alarming sight , some locals said it was nothing unusual for this time of year			1
@entity133 , who was forced to evacuate her farm and home last winter , said : ' it has been raining a lot over the weekend - this is probably water from three days ago			0
' we are designed to take a bit of water - the key thing is how fast they get rid of of it and now we have super duper wide dredged rivers there is plenty of room for water			2
' @entity1 held a meeting to reassure residents they were doing everything possible to prevent last year 's tragedy from repeating			0
representatives from the @entity22 's explained work being done to reduce the risk of flooding , while local council chiefs discussed back up plans			0
residents were also told about measures which have been put in place to keep the roads in use , as well as rescue operations and community flood plans			0
councillor @entity169 , leader of @entity1 said : ' a lot has happened since the disastrous events of last winter and much work is still going on			0
' ( the meeting is ) an opportunity for the broader community to understand what has changed , what flood prevention measures have been put in place and what will now be different should we experience similar conditions across @entity1 in the future			2
' meteorologists say that , although the route of the rainfall is difficult to predict , almost nowhere in @entity68 will escape the wet weather			2
and even though there will be a brief let - up early next week , a second weather front will reach the @entity68 on wednesday , pushing rain over central and southern @entity68 towards the middle and end of next week			1
@entity191 from the @entity192 said : ' bands of rain will keep coming through and , while they are not unusual , they are fairly static and continuous			0
we are getting a big accumulation of rainfall and it will be hanging around for quite a while			0
' we are looking at unsettled weather over the next few days			0
most places throughout the next couple of days will see some rain at some time			0
' the @entity192 has issued severe weather warnings for the south west , south @entity82 and parts of the south coat tomorrow , where rain will be particularly heavy in the evening			1
areas in @entity84 , south west @entity81 and @entity209 could see up to 70mm fall over tomorrow and friday , the @entity192 said			1
the average total rainfall for the @entity68 over the whole of november is 120mm			0
residents in @entity215 sheltered from the rain this morning , as more wet weather and strong gusts are expected to hit the @entity68 forecasters have warned people to be braced for localised flooding , due to the onslaught of ' persistent ' rain expected over the next few days , as shown here in @entity215 severe weather warnings are in place across the south west , south @entity209 and the south coast , where there were strong winds this morning workmen in @entity215 began setting up the @entity233 market stalls despite the wet weather which swept across @entity235 @entity238 , parts of @entity237 and @entity82 will experience the worst of the strong winds , with a wind weather warning in place tomorrow and there is also a 24 - hour warning in place for heavy rain over @entity84 , which starts at midday tomorrow			1
although the weekend is looking slightly brighter , there will still be showers and strong winds , with only central @entity81 expected to be given some dry weather reprieve			0
but , despite feeling breezy , temperatures will remain around average - about 9 degrees - for the time of year			0
a spokesman for @entity251 said : ' very unsettled on friday with heavy rain across much of the @entity68			0
remaining windy in many eastern areas			0
' saturday will see the risk of rain in northern and eastern parts of @entity257 as well as eastern parts of @entity81			0
some sunny spells are possible further south and west across the @entity68 but with the risk of a scattering of showers too , these most likely in @entity209 and south - west @entity81			1
' @entity264 , chief meteorologist , from the @entity265 , said : ' there is a large low pressure circulation over the eastern @entity73 , some 3,000 miles in diameter , and this spiralling low pressure system will very gradually move eastwards over western @entity270 this weekend , slowly ' spinning itself out '			1
this three - day forecast shows heavy rain across many parts of the @entity68			1
@entity275 could also spread across the country on saturday weather warnings are in place across the south west and west of @entity209 and @entity81 with more warnings expected over the next few days ' bands of rain will move around it so we can expect quite unsettled weather , but the timing and track of these disturbances is difficult to forecast			1
' there is also another smaller disturbance way out over the mid @entity73 that is now caught in the jet stream			0
the jet stream will bring this quickly around the southern flank of the upper low over the east @entity73 and then northwards over the western side of the @entity68 on thursday			2
' the system will be travelling at 40 to 50mph as it runs up over sw @entity81 on thursday morning and then western @entity209 to the @entity87 by thursday afternoon			2
' @entity298 for a time as it moves north with gusts 60mph over exposed parts of the south west and south and west @entity209 with the risk of brief gusts to 70mph across some headlands and hills			1
some heavy rain too over @entity209 and especially east and northern @entity84 with yet another 30 to 40mm for @entity309			1
' the next pulse of rain will push across all areas on thursday night to friday			0
this now looks like it will move a little more quickly so rainfall totals not as high as earlier expected with typically 7 to 15mm for @entity81 and @entity209 , but 30 to 40mm for the @entity316 and particularly the southern @entity317			2
' as pressure rises early next week the weather becoming drier and a little more settled for a time , but the next area of low pressure is likely to reach the west during wednesday and push rain over central and southern @entity68 by thursday			1
' the @entity192 said earlier this week that its latest three - month outlook suggests that there is an increased risk of milder and wetter than average conditions for november , december and january .			0
