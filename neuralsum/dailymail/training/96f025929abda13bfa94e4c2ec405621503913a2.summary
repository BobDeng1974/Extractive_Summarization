by @entity0 attack : deputy prime minister @entity2 will insist fathers should no longer be made to see themselves as bread - winners @entity2 will today launch an extraordinary attack on ‘ old - fashioned ’ bosses who ‘ raise an eyebrow ’ when men ask for time off work to look after their children			1
the deputy prime minister will insist fathers should no longer be made to see themselves as breadwinners rather than carers			1
and he will claim more needs to be done to encourage men into caring professions such as childcare and nursing			0
mr @entity2 will hail the government ’s changes to parental leave rules , which are being torn up next year to smash what he calls an ‘ edwardian ’ attitude that women rather than men should stay at home to look young children			1
it comes as a study found one in three fathers who work in the @entity32 took either no paternity leave or cut short their two - week entitlement			1
the research , carried out by @entity36 , a new support group for working fathers in the @entity39 , also found that one in five men feared it would be ' career death ' to ask for time off to look after their children			1
speaking at the launch of the group today , mr @entity2 will say will say he has ‘ fought to drag the clapped - out rules into the 21st century ’			1
he will highlight new childcare subsidies worth up to £ 2,000 year per child designed to encourage women to return to work , insisting @entity54 ‘ could boost its gdp by up to £ 23billion if we use the skills of our female workforce more effectively ’			1
mr @entity2 will argue there is also a need for a culture change across @entity54 industry to tackle ‘ clapped - out ’ attitudes to flexible , family - friendly working practices			1
he will say : ‘ we need to challenge the ways in which many fathers are still pushed to see themselves as a breadwinner first and carer second – whether it ’s by a manager ’s raised eyebrow when you ask for some family time off , or your friends ’ surprise when you say you ’d like to be a stay - at - home parent if you could			2
’ despite efforts to introduce flexible parental leave that can be shared between men and women and extend free childcare , there are still ‘ hidden prejudices ’ which limit women ’s career ambitions and men ’s ability to spend time with their families			1
the coalition ’s reforms , he will say , are ‘ only the start ’			0
reforms to parental leave , which come into effect next year , have been the subject of a fierce coalition argument and have split the business community			2
but the new study has raised fears that many fathers wo n't take advantage of the new rules , with one in three high - earners saying they wo n't be sharing their partner 's maternity leave			2
@entity104 founder @entity103 said : ' employers need to give greater support to their employees who are working hard , juggling office and home life , otherwise the prospects look dim both for morale in organisations and for the government 's plans for more flexible working			0
' the @entity117 has condemned the reforms as a ‘ nightmare for small businesses ’ , but the @entity121 said it was pleased the @entity122 had listened to concerns about how the system will operate			0
the reforms mean that from april next year , parents will be able to share 52 weeks of parental leave			2
new mothers will have to use the first two weeks , deemed important for recovery and bonding with a baby			0
but then , they will be able to transfer the rest of their time off to their partner – meaning a father can tell his employer he wants as much as 50 weeks off			0
alternatively , parents could each take 25 weeks to run concurrently			0
@entity2 ’s salary is vastly outstripped by his wife			0
mr @entity2 earns £ 134,565 a year as an mp and deputy prime minister , while @entity144 – a @entity145 - born lawyer for international legal firm @entity146 – earns £ 500,000			1
three sons : mr @entity2 and his wife @entity149 , who brings in a £ 500,000 salary from her legal work the @entity152 live in a £ 1.6million townhouse in @entity154 , @entity155			2
they married in 2000 and have three sons – @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158			0
mrs @entity144 has said previously that the pair split the childcare and her husband often tried to do the school run			0
she admitted they had a ‘ fantastic nanny ’ to help look after the children .			0

men should not have to be the breadwinner , deputy prime minister will say
mr @entity2 will hail reforms to parental leave rules and childcare subsidies
will also attack ' clapped - out ' attitudes to family - friendly working in @entity54
one in three fathers in the @entity39 failed to take full two weeks paternity leave
one in five of those *surveyed* said it was ' career death ' to ask for time off
