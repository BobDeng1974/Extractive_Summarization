it took photographer @entity1 eight years of online dating before she finally found her prince			1
the most frustrating part of her dating experience ? constantly meeting people who looked nothing like their profile photographs			1
on one occasion the 44 - year - old could n't find her date in a bar so called his phone only to realise he was standing right next to her - looking utterly different to the hunk she was expecting			2
on another date destined for failure she says she turned up expecting someone ' who looked like @entity21 ' only to to be faced with someone who looked ' more like @entity23 '			0
' needless to say , i did n’t stay long , ' says the @entity26 - based photographer			2
' it ’s not that i ’m shallow about looks - far from it - but it ’s about being honest to people from the outset			0
lying about age , height or looks is not a great way to start a meaningful relationship			0
or did it ? you caught me ! : in another of @entity41 's shots she 's seen chilling on the grass ' even if guys did n't intend to mislead , i found they used out - of - date , blurry photos , ' she adds			2
inspired by her uninspiring experiences , @entity1 set out to put the online dating world to right with her company ' @entity54 ' , a photography firm specialising in online dating profiles			1
she left her job as a senior manager in a charity to study photography at @entity62 art school before setting up her business in may last year			0
online dater @entity64 snapped by @entity1 oh , i did n't notice you there ! : will online daters be attracted to the casual poses ? she now says she has over 200 clients and offers three different packages - a 30 - minute shoot with three images costing £ 80 , an hour shoot and six images costing £ 140 and the whole shebang with ten images and a 90 - minute session for £ 210			1
considering research has found that 90 per cent of online dating decisions are made according to pictures rather than the written profile , it 's not a bad investment for those looking for love			1
when it comes to her dating photography @entity1 has a clear ethos - to create images that have a natural but confident and happy feel			1
' the idea is to create a set of photos that are of professional quality , but look as though they have been taken while they 're out with their friends - by a friend with a good camera ! ' i shoot outdoors and stay away from studios to avoid those embarrassing , naff studio shots which just do n't work for dating			1
' left : @entity109 in her previous profile shot , with just an eyebrow of her ex on show ; right : looking confident in her new photograph @entity1 believes that an ideal profile image needs colour and personality , as in @entity109 's portrait , above @entity109 looking happy and confident - two important elements to attract online love interest , according to @entity1 so who has are the saturday night 's alright clients ? ' they 're ready to take dating seriously and want to do everything they can to give themselves the best opportunity of finding a compatible partner			1
and i love knowing that i play a key role in helping them achieve that			0
' i totally understand who my clients are and the journey they are on - and i think they value that			0
' but not everyone on ' the journey ' is keen to be given the professional finish			0
' it 's certainly not for me , ' says 35 - year - old lawyer @entity137			2
' there 's nothing less attractive than looking like you 've made too much effort and even if they 're casual ' but according to @entity1 , clients often find their new profile pictures bring them dating success			1
one such singleton , @entity146 , swears by his new - found dating image			2
' it 's already made a massive difference in a few days , ' he says			0
cool or contrived : would you use a professional shot on your dating profile ? @entity153 , pictured above , has gone the professional route @entity155 , above , photographed by @entity1			1
the photographer 's ethos is to create shots that look like they could have been casually taken by a friend before : saturday night 's @entity162 client @entity161 , reveals her previous profile look after : @entity161 looking casual yet sexy in her updated image so given @entity1 's expertise on the dating game , what 's her advice for creating the perfect profile shot - whether it 's a home snap or a professional ? ' most people are n’t impressed with out of focus , dark , dingy photos with messy backgrounds			1
it 's not going to jump off the page and stand out			0
but my pet hate is when an ex is cropped out the picture			0
it 's such a turn off			0
' i love profile photos that are bright , well - lit , have pin - sharp focus and are colourful to help them stand out from the sea of dating photos on any dating site			2
' i also love a photo which tells people a little about the person ’s personality			0
clothes , make - up , hair style , accessories , props , the background and location all help with this and it just needs a little thought beforehand to get it right			0
' the photographer adds , ' it ’s also important that the person in the photo is looking confident , relaxed , happy and attractive - that goes such a long way to attracting people to your profile			2
' @entity209 ( left ) and @entity210 ( right ) in their professional saturday night 's alright images photographer @entity1 spent eight years on the dating scene , which inspired her to set up an online dating profile service			1
