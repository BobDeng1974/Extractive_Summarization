maybe it is a formality , after all			0
@entity1 said recently no decision had been made on who would be @entity5 ’s next captain but is there really a decision to make ? for all that @entity5 ’s manager will not be rushed into anointing @entity11 ’s successor , @entity8 is compiling a case that is becoming impossible to overlook			1
he did exactly what a @entity5 skipper should do , making the difference in a game of great significance			2
fresh from unleashing a thunderbolt that unhinged @entity27 , @entity8 delivered once again , with a goal , an assist – his 11th of the season – for @entity19 and 90 - minutes of relentless running in a 2 - 0 win that enhanced his side ’s @entity23 ambitions			1
@entity5 midfielder and vice-captain @entity8 ( left ) celebrates scoring the opening goal for his side against @entity32 @entity33 ( left ) readies himself for the shot of @entity32 striker @entity35 ( right ) during the @entity37 game at @entity38 on wednesday @entity5 's attacking midfielder @entity39 ( left ) @entity39 closes down @entity32 's @entity40 ( right ) who has a shot at goal @entity44 boss @entity1 ( left ) stands unmoved on the touchline while @entity32 counterpart @entity46 ( right ) shouts at officials @entity32 winger @entity48 shields the ball away from the oncoming @entity33 ( right ) as his side chase the game at @entity38 @entity8 opens the scoring with a long - range effort , netting his second goal in his last two appearances for @entity5 the midfielder lashes in a right - footed attempt from outside the box as @entity5 continue their charge on a top - four finish @entity8 slides to his knees delighted and is congratulated by team - mates @entity39 ( right ) and @entity64 ( left ) @entity5 ( 3 - 4 - 3 ) : @entity65 7.5 , can 7.5 , @entity66 7 , @entity67 7 : @entity39 6.5 , @entity8 8.5 , @entity68 7.5 , @entity69 6.5 ( @entity70 73 , 6 ) , @entity64 6.5 , @entity19 6.5 ( @entity71 82 , 6 ) , @entity72 7.5 subs not used : @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 scorers : @entity8 29 , @entity19 51 manager : @entity1 7.5 @entity32 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity80 7.5 : @entity81 7 , @entity82 7 , @entity83 7 , @entity84 6.5 : @entity85 6 , @entity86 7 , @entity87 6.5 , @entity48 6 ( @entity88 52 , 6 ) : @entity89 6 ( @entity90 66 , 6 ) , @entity35 6.5 ( @entity91 90 , 6 ) subs not used : @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity77 booked : @entity84 manager : @entity46 6 referee : @entity98 6.5 attendance : 44,717 @entity100 : @entity8 @entity19 caps off a well worked @entity5 move to give his side a 2 - 0 lead on 51 minutes			1
this may not have been as eye - catching as sunday ’s tour de force but it was no less impressive			0
they were ruthless , efficient and energetic with excellent performers all over the pitch and in @entity8 , @entity1 had someone to set the necessary example			1
‘ we were talking before the game about how well he ( @entity8 ) is doing , ’ noted @entity19			1
‘ he is improving in every game and he has taken the responsibility with the armband			0
he has taken it to the next level			0
’ these are the types of games that @entity11 , watching in the @entity123 , has grabbed by the scruff of the neck and he would have nodded approvingly at the way @entity8 led @entity5 in his absence			1
so , too , would @entity1			2
games that come so soon after significant victories can often become tests of endurance rather than opportunities to make statements and there was a reason to believe , having expended so much energy against @entity27 , that @entity32 could make things difficult			2
@entity5 started , however , with intent			2
quick , aggressive , energetic , they burst out of the blocks and could have had the lead within 24 seconds when move full of deft flicks and subtle touches , that brought @entity38 to its feet , ended with @entity80 flinging himself to thwart @entity19			1
@entity5 striker @entity19 ( right ) competes for the ball with @entity32 's @entity83 ( left ) during the @entity37 clash @entity19 ( right ) uses his pace to lose his marker , @entity32 defender @entity148 ( left ) and advance forward on the opposition goal @entity5 defender @entity67 ( left ) climbs highest to head the ball away from @entity32 striker @entity89 ( right ) yet @entity32 were not daunted			1
@entity11 noted in his programme notes that “ nobody has it easy ” against @entity46 ’s side and they were intent of making this a contest , just as they had done at the @entity159 and @entity160			0
at one point , when @entity66 scuffed a clearance that nearly allowed @entity32 to profit , @entity1 span on his heels and shook his head , anxious @entity5 might not capitalise on that big effort three days prior to topple the champions			1
his anxieties , though , were soon quelled			0
@entity8 had served notice of his intent in the 24th minute , when forcing a plunging save from @entity80 , but there was nothing @entity32 ’s keeper could do when the ball fell to him on the half - hour and he rifled in a swerving half - volley into the @entity178 net			1
@entity8 might not commands big headlines but his importance to this @entity5 team should not be taken for granted and this was a vital contribution , his goal releasing the tension			2
with 16 months left on his current deal , @entity5 must surely endeavour to finalise a new contract for him			0
‘ his strike was terrific and so was the ball for the second goal , ’ said @entity5 ’s manager			0
‘ he has wonderful athleticism and is improving all the time			0
with him learning tactically he will become even better			0
it was a wonderful performance by him			0
’ had @entity19 taken a glorious chance in the 42nd minute , when @entity72 ushered him through , the game would have been wrapped up but , as it was , @entity5 were given a reminder in injury time that they still had work to do when @entity89 tested @entity65 with a header			1
@entity32 came out fighting at the re-start and @entity65 needed to take dramatic action in the 48th minute when he surged out of his goal to head away a ball that was @entity89 was chasing , clattering into the forward in the process			0
@entity35 ( centre ) presses forward for @entity32 but is challenged by @entity5 winger @entity64 ( right ) @entity44 striker @entity19 ( right ) again battles @entity32 's @entity83 ( left ) with @entity5 firmly in control of the game @entity8 rises highest send a headed effort towards @entity80 in the @entity32 goal at @entity38 on wednesday night @entity8 ’s strike meant @entity5 scored three @entity37 goals in a row from outside the penalty area for the first time since 2007			1
yet any hope they had of a comeback was soon extinguished			0
@entity5 pushed forward , with @entity39 bobbing and weaving on the edge of the area , trying to find a way through ; @entity8 arrived to provide support and his precise cross demanded @entity19 apply the finish touch			1
from that point on , there was never any suggestion @entity5 , who have collected 30 point from the last 36 available , would falter , particularly with @entity33 – the hugely impressive @entity230 whom @entity1 labelled as being on the verge of “ world - class ” – helping @entity8 set the tone			1
with good reason , @entity5 will be looking at their fixtures in the spring and sensing an opportunity to attack but so , too , do @entity32			2
this might have been an eighth game without winning but he is not in the mood to thrown in the towel			0
‘ @entity5 were a different side to the one we ( lost to ) on @entity244 , ’ said @entity46			2
‘ i would have taken being in this position with 10 games to go			0
there are teams under more pressure than we are			0
’ @entity5 manager @entity1 beams as he watches a dominant display from his side against relegation battlers @entity32 @entity19 loses his man and leaps to score a headed goal and give @entity5 a 2 - 0 lead over @entity46 's men at @entity38 @entity19 's goal sealed three points for @entity5 , a result that sees them move to fifth in the @entity37 table			1

@entity5 secured a 2 - 0 win over @entity37 *strugglers* @entity32 at @entity38
@entity8 opened the scoring for the @entity44 with a long - range effort in the first - half
@entity19 sealed the three points with a header after the restart
the result sees @entity5 move to fifth in the @entity37 table with 51 points
@entity1 ' side are two points behind fourth - placed @entity278
