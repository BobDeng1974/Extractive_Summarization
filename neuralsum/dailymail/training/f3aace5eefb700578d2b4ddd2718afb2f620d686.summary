change of scenery : soldiers from the @entity23 - based 2nd battalion of the @entity12 , patrol at dusk as they take part in @entity32 on the outskirts of @entity19 , @entity9 staged fight : soldiers try to control a staged riot scene , one of many elements in the exercise which saw the regiment pitched into a fictional battle between two made - up nations morning call : piper @entity42 from @entity43 plays his pipes as the sunrises over @entity9 described as a ' sophisticated game of laser tag ' , troops had been armed with muzzled weapons loaded with blank rounds			1
using a set of lasers and receivers attached to each soldier , any simulated injuries could be recorded as the @entity11 went up against the @entity58 's @entity57 regiment			0
the staged battle also included village riots staged by local @entity61 , employed to take part and add an extra dimension to the exercise			1
the soldiers were not told how events would unfold and had to react to developments around them as if they were real			2
at one point , troops had to intervene in a fictional village where actors had been hired to play out a clash over the made - up battle			1
this scene also saw staged blasts hitting the village , and the troops had to handle ' the victims ' - locals using blood - covered prosthetic limbs			2
hard at work : sandbags are filled to reinforce the trenches dug out by soldiers from the @entity11 , the @entity12 the staged battle also included village riots staged by local @entity61 , employed to take part and add an extra dimension to the exercise a soldier puts camouflage on as the troops from the @entity11 , the @entity12 ready themselves for the exercise an unnamed soldier from the @entity11 , the @entity12 takes aim as sergeant @entity94 from @entity95 cools down during the fake - battle @entity19 , @entity9 acting up : a man plays the role of the minister as he tries to move villagers away as a riot scene is staged by locals controlling the crowd : troops had to intervene in a fictional village where actors had been hired to play out a clash over the made - up battle fake it til you make it : ' injured villagers ' used blood - covered prosthetic limbs to add realism to the faked riot during the exercise all fake : the scenes which saw the soldiers break up a village riot were not rehearsed and the soldiers had to deal with the situation as they would in real life a ' casualty ' is carried away as soldiers from the @entity11 , the @entity12 , take part in @entity32 new experience : a young soldier looks on during the staged riot on the outskirts of @entity19 , @entity9 the training site in @entity9 used to be seen as the primary base to prepare for deployments to @entity133 but the the latest exercise was designed to ' reset the regiment 's dna ' as an infantry unit			1
commanding officer @entity138 said : ' here , we 've gone back to basics - a light infantry force working out of a backpack , living on our feet and demonstrating our capabilities against what we would call a near peer enemy ; an enemy that is not an insurgent , but a more conventional force who have their own artillery , air support and those sorts of things			0
' it 's getting back to basics and resetting our dna as infantrymen			0
' under an agreement with the @entity61 government , six @entity58 battalions carry out exercises in @entity9 every year , and despite a diplomatic row last year over travel advice issued by the @entity1 to @entity1 travelling to the east @entity167 country , it remains an important base			1
commander @entity138 added : ' it 's such an important relationship we have ( with @entity9 )			2
we 're only here as guests of the @entity61 people and they are truly hospitable			0
' we have many locals taking part as players in the exercise in some of the fictional villages and they do the job so well			1
' the animals roaming the training area gave the exercise a sense of safari but the wildlife was not kind to everyone			2

' when we 're being transported between spots you see hundreds of animals - sometimes elephants , baboons and lots of zebras - but when you 're on the job you hardly notice them because you 're concentrating so much , ' the 23 - year - old said			1
' that 's what happened when i got stung by a scorpion while i was pulling my bergen ( backpack ) off one of the trucks			0
' it must 've been underneath , i did n't see it and it stung me on my right hand			0
i had pins and needles and i felt a bit rough - like i had a really bad hangover - but the medics said it was n't poisonous so it wore away and i just got on with it			0
' although @entity20 is a training exercise , the troops are pushed to their limits			1
pipe major @entity42 , from @entity43 , said : ' the first lot of phases were in @entity264 where it was absolutely roasting , around 45 degrees			0
' i think i managed three hours sleep in the first couple of days of the final exercise because we were moving and preparing at night			2
resting : the training site in @entity9 used to be seen as the primary base to prepare for deployments to @entity133 but the the latest exercise was designed to ' reset the regiment 's dna ' as an infantry unit soldiers ' dinner : captain @entity278 cooks rations on mess tins as the sun sets on the troops in @entity9 playing and pretending : private @entity283 digs a trench on the outskirts of @entity19 , @entity9 entrenched : a soldier eats his rations in a trench as troops take a short break during @entity32 commanding officer @entity138 ( centre ) talks with soldiers at @entity293 during @entity32 groom - to - be : corporal @entity295 from @entity296 , @entity297 , took part in the exercise in @entity9 just weeks before his wedding ' it 's obviously very different from deployments where the danger is real and everywhere but it 's hard work and everyone takes it seriously			1
' i just hope i 've got enough energy to play the bagpipes in the final leg of the exercise , i 'm thinking i 'll do the @entity314 theme			0
' private @entity315 , from @entity23 , spent four hours digging one trench with his platoon after an overnight move			0
he said : ' three of us worked non-stop to get in to the ground in the middle of a valley , which is so dry			0
' my hands were sore , feet agony and we get a wee break before it 's on to the next one			0
' corporal @entity295 from @entity296 , @entity297 , was in the country with his regiment for the third time , just weeks before his wedding next month			0

despite six weeks away , @entity334 said his fiancee @entity335 was not worried about his trip being so close to their big day			0
