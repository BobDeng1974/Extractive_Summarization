this breaks @entity25 – the @entity26 , the chamber of the court ruled			1
the seven judges came to this conclusion on a 4 - 3 majority			2
the court said neither passengers or colleagues had complained about mr @entity2 , who was considered a ‘ first - class employee ’ before his @entity7 membership became public knowledge			1
‘ @entity38 was struck by the fact that he had been summarily dismissed following complaints about problems which had never actually occurred , without any apparent consideration being given to the possibility of transferring him to a non-customer facing role , ’ it added			0
the court ruled that right to freedom of association must apply to everyone , not just those whose views are considered favourable or inoffensive , but also ‘ those whose views offend , shock or disturb ’			0

he was summarily dismissed when he was elected as local councillor for the @entity7			2

ruling : @entity2 won his case at the @entity4 in @entity20 where judges voted 4 - 3 affiliated : @entity2 was dismissed because he was a member of the @entity7 , which is led by @entity55 ( pictured ) the tribunal found his continued employment could cause considerable anxiety among @entity21 ’s passengers and their carers and there was a risk vehicles could come under attack from opponents of the @entity7			1

the @entity20 judgment also criticised the fact mr @entity2 could not bring a case of unfair dismissal against @entity21 in 2004 because @entity120 law said he had not worked long enough for the firm			2
the driver was forced to claim race discrimination because no unfair dismissal claim was allowed within the first year of employment			0

the judgment added : ‘ a legal system which allowed dismissal from employment solely on account of an employee ’s membership of a political party carried with it the potential for abuse and was therefore deficient			0
