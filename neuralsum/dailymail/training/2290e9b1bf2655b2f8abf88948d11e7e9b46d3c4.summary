a crisis of confidence among girls studying maths is dragging down their performance at school and stunting their choice of careers , a report has found			1
girls are better than boys in most subjects and outperform them in the vast majority of formal exams			2
but they have so little self - belief in maths that they are up to a term behind boys by their mid-teens and are far more likely to drop it for a-levels			1
crisis : the performance of girls in maths is being dragged down by their lack of confidence , a report found ( @entity29 picture ) the low expectations are the result of parents and teachers assuming they are better suited to other subjects , according to the @entity35 , which conducted the research and described its findings as ‘ troubling ’			1
the study of 15 - year - olds in developed countries revealed 41 per cent of @entity42 girls believe they are not good at maths , compared to just 24 per cent of boys			1
this translates into just ten per cent being high - fliers in the subject at school , compared to 13 per cent of boys			1
the @entity35 average is 11 per cent and 15 per cent respectively			1
the worst - performing girls are around three months behind their counterparts in other @entity35 countries and a staggering six years adrift of top students in world leader @entity55			1
self - belief : 41 per cent of @entity42 girls believe they are not good at maths , compared to just 24 per cent of boys , according to research ( stock picture ) the gender gap in teenagers planning to continue studying maths when they leave school is 14 per cent in the @entity42 - 60 per cent of boys and 46 per cent of girls - compared to an average of 12 per cent in developed countries			1
and girls rule themselves out of some of the most lucrative jobs because of their dislike for the subject			0
only 40 per cent would consider a job that ‘ requires considerable use of mathematics ’ over one that is science - based , while for boys it is 50 per cent			2
even if they choose science - heavy jobs , they tend to opt for those with little maths , such as health and social fields			2
boys show a preference to be engineers or computer scientists			0
the study suggested there is no genetic reason for the difference between the sexes in the @entity42			0
there is no gender gap in 23 of the 65 countries or major economic regions studied and girls outperform boys in several countries including @entity103 and @entity104			2
the data comes from further analysis of the @entity35 ’s 2012 @entity108 survey ( @entity108 ) , which last month revealed @entity42 teenagers have dropped out of the top 20 rankings in maths , science and reading for the first time			1
pupils in @entity116 , @entity55 and @entity117 now have a better understanding of all three core subjects			0
another report from the organisation in october found the @entity42 was the only country where young people were worse at maths and reading than those approaching retirement , despite years of rising exam grades			1
the latest research said there had been no improvement in closing the gap in maths between boys and girls since 2003			2
let down : education minister @entity134 said girls had been let down by ' outdated assumptions about what they are good at ' ( @entity29 picture ) the authors said : ‘ more troubling still is the fact that the gender gap extends to students ’ attitudes towards learning mathematics , which has repercussions in life well beyond school			0
‘ shrinking the gender gap in mathematics performance will require the concerted effort of parents , teachers and society as a whole to change the stereotyped notions of what boys and girls excel at , what they enjoy doing and what they believe they can achieve			0
’ recommendations to ‘ change the mindset ’ include making the subject more interesting to girls and eliminating stereotypes in textbooks			0
education minister @entity134 said girls had been let down by ‘ outdated assumptions about what they are good at ’			0
she added : ‘ this government ’s reforms are fixing the problem			0
thanks to the new @entity177 measure [ of core subjects including @entity179 , maths and science to check a school ’s performance ] , the number of girls doing @entity174 physics is at record levels , while girls ’ a-level entries for chemistry and maths are at their highest ever levels			0

@entity35 studied 15 - year - olds
it revealed 41 per cent of @entity42 girls believe they are not good at maths
same survey found just 24 per cent of boys had same crisis of confidence
