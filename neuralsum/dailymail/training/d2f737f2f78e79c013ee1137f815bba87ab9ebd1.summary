by @entity0 published : 09:51 est , 5 august 2013 updated : 11:08 est , 5 august 2013 from a gentle tweeze to the full @entity4 strip , having a well - groomed look down below has become almost as important as ensuring the hair on your head looks good			0
but one @entity9 hair salon has taken the creative approach to grooming one step further and is offering £ 40 dye jobs for your short and curlies along with their regular cut and blowdries			1
whether you 're after a pink heart - shaped patch or a pretty leopard print ' do , @entity18 , which has branches in @entity22 's @entity21 flagship and in @entity23 , has a dye job to suit even the quirkiest of tastes			1
controversial : @entity30 caused a furore when they used this photo of visible pubic topiary in a 2003 ad campaign fan : @entity37 singer @entity36 is a regular visitor to @entity18 the looks gaining the most love at the moment are the leopard - print landing strip and a vivid neon dye job			1
but it seems that not everyone is impressed with the salon 's new offerings , with owner @entity48 admitting that pubic dye jobs provoke strong reactions among her clientele			1
' it ’s a bit like @entity54 , ' she told @entity56 ' people seem to either love it or hate it			0
we put it [ pubic dye jobs ] on the menu for a bit of fun but it ’s getting to be quite popular , especially because of the summer			1
' i ’ve had it done , a few of our stylists have had it done , loads of my friends have been in and had it done			0
' we ’ve got people coming in just for a wax that are seeing it , thinking about it , and then coming in the next time asking for it			0
every one of my friends who has had it done has come in for a second go			0
' unusual though a neon @entity80 might be , it 's not the first time that @entity48 's creative urges have made waves			1
she was famously responsible for the dip - dyed ' ombre ' hair trend that dominated last summer and counts @entity37 's @entity36 and singer @entity88 among her clients			2
@entity48 was also responsible for @entity91 's controversial embrace of greying locks - and has revealed that it was discovering grey pubic hairs on her own nether regions that led to the launch of the salon 's increasingly popular pubic prettying service			1
customer : @entity100 , @entity18 's owner , also counts @entity102 singer @entity88 among her clients ' first you pick the shape you want — a triangle , strip , heart — anything like that , ' she explains of the dyeing process			1
' then @entity111 [ @entity113 's public hair expert ] will paint the area in the shape , you do n’t actually dye all of it			2
' it is then bleached , left on for 10 to 15 minutes , then wiped off and a secondary colour is applied			0
this is a stain and only takes two minutes			0
' then @entity111 takes that off and does the waxing procedure as normal			0
no paper underwear , but you do have a disposable towel on top and a blanket on your legs so you ’re not just sitting there waiting			0
' she added : ' we ’ve done multicolour , pink and blue hearts — hearts are very popular — tie - dye , and leopard print			2
' @entity111 is always experimenting and pushing it forward ; she sees how the stylists dye hair and wants to try it out and it goes from there			2

clients at @entity9 's @entity18 can choose from a *variety* of colours
pubic topiary can also be waxed into heart , triangle and other shapes
