plans for the next stage in the fight against terrorism could be in the toilet - quite literally			0
@entity6 scientists have developed sensors that can be fitted inside waste tunnels and used to detect bomb making chemicals in sewage			1
if suspect chemicals are detected , the sensor alerts the authorities who can carry out infrared laser ‘ sweeps ’ above ground to locate the precise location of the bomb - making factory			2
the @entity21 has developed sensors fitted inside tunnels , such as the one in this stock image , that detect bomb making chemicals in waste			1
it uses ' ion - selective electrodes ' to determine trace elements			0
if the level of ions is high enough to arouse suspicion , the system alerts the authorities @entity35 is made up of a ‘ network ’ of sensors plotted above and underground that can detect chemicals in liquid waste , and detect gas vapours			1
each sensor contains ‘ ion - selective electrodes ’ that sit in the flow of waste water in sewage tunnels			0
if a bomb - maker flushes chemicals down the toilet , or the chemicals and gases from bomb making are ingested into the person ’s blood stream and ultimately enter their urine or faeces , these chemicals will pass through the sensors			1
the ions that are found in these chemicals will travel through the electrodes and change a resistor ’s voltage			0
this change is recorded and tracked using software designed to seek out even the smallest traces of suspect ions			0
the system is called emphasis , which stands for @entity67 and @entity68			2
developed by the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) , it is made up of a ‘ network ’ of sensors plotted above and below ground that can detect chemicals in liquid waste , and detect gas vapours			1
each sensor contains ‘ ion - selective electrodes ’ which are around four inches long and sit in the flow of waste water in sewage tunnels			0
if a bomb - maker flushes chemicals down the toilet , or the chemicals from bomb making are ingested into a person ’s blood stream and ultimately enter their urine or faeces , these chemicals will pass through the sensors			1
the ions that are found in these chemicals travel through the electrodes and change the built - in resistor ’s voltage			0
this change is recorded and tracked using software designed to seek out even the smallest traces of suspect ions			0
this infographic explains the concept behind the @entity35 sewage detection sensor network			0
if a bomb - maker flushes chemicals down the toilet , or the chemicals from are ingested into the person 's blood stream and ultimately enter their urine or faeces , these chemicals will pass through the sensors if the ions are found in ‘ elevated amounts ’ , data about the type of ions , the approximate location based on the proximity of the sensors , the time and the level of ions detected are sent to a command centre			1
mobile units armed with infrared lasers then carry out a scan of the nearby area in a bid to detect suspect gas molecules and narrow down the target area			1
as the target area is narrowed , extra sensors are placed in the sewers around that area to pinpoint the precise location			2
if ions are found in ' elevated amounts ' , data about the type of ions , the approximate location of based on the proximity of the sensors , the time and the level of ions detected are sent to a command centre			1
mobile units armed with infrared lasers , pictured , then carry out a scan of the nearby area in a bid to detect suspect gas molecules and narrow down the target area @entity35 is an @entity147 - funded project for the ‘ detection of production of explosives			1
’ the objective of the @entity35 project is to test a system for detecting ' ongoing illicit production of explosives and improvised explosive devices in urban areas			2
' according to the @entity21 website : ‘ the goal of the @entity35 project is to test a system concept for the surveillance tool of tomorrow for detection and localisation of illicit bomb factories in urban areas			2
’ the team have already successfully tested the sensors in waste water inside a lab and intend to trial the sensors in sewers next year .			0

emphasis system was created by the @entity21
sensors are placed in sewers to detect chemicals used in bomb making
chemicals are detected either because they have been poured down the *drain* or ingested into the terrorist 's blood stream and then excreted
once detected , the information is sent to a command centre
a mobile unit then uses infrared lasers to scan the areas for gas molecules
these molecules can help further pinpoint the location of a bomb maker
