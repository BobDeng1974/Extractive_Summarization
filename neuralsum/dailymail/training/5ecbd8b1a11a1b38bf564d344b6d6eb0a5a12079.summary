after displays to please the eye this season , @entity0 displayed their determined side to rescue a draw with 10 men and ascent to the summit of the championship			1
@entity10 scored with 17 minutes left to edge @entity12 's side a point ahead of @entity14 and @entity15			0
a day after @entity18 's parent company brought in receivers to control affairs , it looked like the team would produce a positive response , courtesy of a @entity25 penalty that also saw @entity0 goalkeeper @entity26 sent off			1
midfielder @entity25 converts a penalty to give @entity18 a 1 - 0 lead at @entity29 's @entity18 forward @entity30 ( left ) tussles for the ball with @entity0 defender @entity33 but , perhaps hesistant after six games without a win , they failed to press their numerical advantage and the visitors finished the contest the better team			1
@entity10 struck his 12th goal of the season with a finish through the legs of @entity45 , following a one - two with @entity46 to unlock @entity18 's defence			0
' the mighty @entity0 , we 're going up , ' the travelling fans chanted			2
who can blame their optimism after nine league matches without defeat			0
@entity55 's team had gone ahead thanks to a terribly underhit backpass from @entity33 in the 42nd minute			0
@entity57 seized onto the ball ahead of @entity26 , touching it into space , only to be brought down by the diving @entity0 goalkeeper			1
@entity62 striker @entity57 jumps and fends off pressure from @entity0 's @entity64 @entity18 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity45 , @entity25 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 ( @entity69 60 ) , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 ( @entity73 77 ) , @entity30 ( @entity74 69 ) , @entity57 subs not used : @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 booked : @entity71 scorers : caddis 45 ( pen ) @entity0 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity26 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity33 , @entity84 , @entity46 , @entity85 , @entity86 ( reach 85 ) , @entity10 , @entity87 ( @entity88 62 ) , @entity89 ( @entity90 45 ) subs not used : @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 booked : @entity96 sent off : @entity97 scorers : @entity99 74 referee : @entity101 attendance : 15,101 referee @entity101 was some distance away but pointed to the spot without hesitation , producing he red card soon after			1
the incident bore echoes of @entity110 's penalty against @entity111 but @entity26 remaining on the ground injured illustrated contact had been made here			2
there may have been an element of gamesmanship as the 36 - year - old @entity117 took his time to walk from the field with @entity120 coming on , but it proved fruitless			0
three minutes after the initial award @entity25 dispatched from 12 yards with zero fuss			2
tensions on the touchline had been bubbling away , with @entity55 and @entity12 exchanging words and jabbed fingers at one stage , but little argument was made over this key decision			0
it had been an even contest to that point , @entity18 shading the attacking moments thanks to the deadball delivery of @entity71 and the pace of @entity136			0
@entity72 struck a fine shot from range that required a good save , while @entity65 was denied by a desperate block from @entity33			0
@entity0 goalkeeper @entity26 was sent off after he brought down @entity57 @entity57 is sent flying after the late challenge from @entity26 towards the end of the first - half @entity26 protests as referee @entity101 brandishes the red card , but it makes no difference the visitors , naming seven of the same starting xi who began sunday 's @entity152 defeat top @entity153 , could have taken the lead as early as the third minute			1
@entity85 burst through in midfield and released @entity156 in the area , but the @entity0 winger sent his shot just wide of the far post			2
after scoring the spot kick , @entity25 runs off to celebrate with his team - mates @entity57 and @entity33 battle for the ball during the @entity166 match at @entity29 's @entity18 's @entity72 ( left ) and @entity0 's @entity85 wrestle in midfield @entity12 's side actually improved a man down , @entity89 the player making way , and thought they had levelled when substitute @entity172 placed the ball in the net			1
but the offside flag had been raised			0
@entity12 's crew wanted a penalty when @entity10 fell under pressure from @entity66 but @entity101 was unmoved and bemused fourth official @entity178 was left to count the six backroom staffers who had stood up to appeal			0
given the circumstances , they will be happy to leave the @entity182 in first position â€“ doubly so when they saw @entity57 somehow plant his header from a @entity25 cross over the bar in added time			1
@entity0 striker @entity10 scores past @entity62 goalkeeper @entity45 to make it 1 - 1 the result sees @entity0 climb to the top of the @entity166 as they target a return to the top - flight			1

@entity25 scored a 74th minute equaliser after @entity25 ' penalty
