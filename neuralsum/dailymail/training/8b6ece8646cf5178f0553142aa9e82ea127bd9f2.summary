one @entity1 family was looking forward to a relaxing trip to sunny @entity3			0
but that trip screeched to a halt when a @entity6 agent in @entity8 ’s @entity7 targeted and searched the family ’s disabled seven - year - old daughter , who suffers from cerebral palsy			1
@entity12 could not walk through the metal detectors because of her crutches and orthotics , and was instead subjected to a pat down by security agents – a severely traumatic event for the young girl			1
dr @entity19 , a doctor who practices pediatrics on @entity1 , exclusively told the @entity21 that the lengthy pat down and resulting emotional trauma caused the family to miss their flight to @entity3			1
the congressman called the @entity6 agent ‘ aggressive , ’ adding : ‘ he was patting me down where no one is supposed to go , ’ according to @entity39			1
when the congressman moved the @entity6 worker ’s hand away , the agent stopped the search and brought in supervisors , he said			2
the @entity6 told @entity39 that neither man was cited in the incident			0
‘ she ’s not a threat to national security , ’ the outraged father told the @entity50 news publication			0
because of a reported mental illness , the family requested that the @entity6 agents introduce themselves to her and take their time with the pat - down			1
dr @entity19 said the @entity6 agent on duty at @entity62 was unnecessarily aggressive with @entity12 , and so he began filming the inspection on his @entity64			1
he said one of the @entity6 employees began screaming at him to turn the camera off , and threatened him			0
later , a supervisor eventually decided that a simple inspection of @entity12 ’s crutches was sufficient , and let the family pass			2
the @entity21 reported that the family had to wait for more than an hour for a manager told them that the @entity6 ’s inspection of @entity12 was acceptable and they could proceed to the gate			1
the family hurried down to their gate with @entity12 in a wheelchair , hoping to make their flight			1
however , the commotion at the security checkpoint , combined with the excruciating wait , had eaten up too much time , though , and the @entity76 missed their flight			2
the government agency launched a program in december of last year called ‘ @entity89 ’ that is supposed to assist those with mental and physical disabilities			0
their website reads : ‘ @entity6 strives to provide the highest level of security while ensuring that all passengers are treated with dignity and respect			2
’ the helpline number offers support to those who are travelling with people who have certain medical issues , physical limitations , or mental handicaps			0
the @entity6 did not respond to calls or emails from @entity107 requesting comment			0
there is some good news in all of this – @entity12 was able to take her first unassisted steps following a revolutionary procedure where @entity114 and phenol are injected into her muscles			0
as @entity117 @entity8 reported , @entity12 gets injections twice a year at @entity119			0
phenol is an alcohol often used for chemical peels while @entity114 is famously used to fight wrinkles			0
happy ending : by getting @entity114 injections in her muscles twice a year , @entity12 is able to walk without crutches or a wheelchair departure : the @entity19 family was flying out of @entity8 's @entity7 , destined for sunny @entity3			1

@entity12 , seven , forced to undergo ' lengthy ' pat - down from ' overly aggressive ' @entity6 agent at @entity7
@entity132 requested that @entity6 agent introduce himself and take his time
@entity6 manager finally let family go through security but family missed flight
