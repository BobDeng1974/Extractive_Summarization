furious parents have accused @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , of taking autistic and dyslexic children out of classes to ' hide them ' from @entity5 inspectors enraged father @entity21 said his 15 - year - old son @entity22 , who suffers from dyslexia , was removed from important @entity7 and maths lessons and put into a mechanics lesson for two days while the inspectors were at the school			1
mr @entity21 , a former soldier , said : ' i 'm furious			0
my son did n't mind that he was moved classes as he does well in motor mechanics as to him that 's the easy subject , but obviously the other subjects like @entity7 are the ones he struggles in			1
' not only does this give a false impression to @entity5 but my main concern is that he is now missing out on lessons where he needs the extra teaching			1
' the reason given to him by the school was that they did n't want to risk that he along with all the others , another five in total , might cause disruption during the visit			2
' their reason is completely unfounded without any justification and purely based on an assumption			0
' the 46 - year - old , who has two other children at the secondary school , said @entity22 's autistic classmates were also ' hidden ' from the inspectors			1
some children were removed from @entity7 , maths and science lessons last week as the education watchdog visited the @entity61 veteran fumed : ' i spoke to another parent whose son is autistic and she said she received a call from the school on wednesday basically saying we think it would be better if he did n't come in as they did n't think her son would be able to cope with an inspector sat at the back of the room			1
' they did n't give her an option , they were telling her not asking			0
she asked if that was allowed and was told it would be an authorised absence			0
' writing on @entity82 , school governor @entity81 accused parents of ' trying to cause trouble for no good reason '			1
@entity87 dr @entity86 ' a small number of very autistic kids were considered to need protecting from the obvious change to routine that would normally occur during the normal full @entity5 inspection , ' he said			1
' the parents had to be informed so they could decide whether to send their children in			2
it is sad that some misguided people have stirred a false and grossly misleading story			0
' it is quite clear to me that some parents are simply trying to cause trouble for no good reason			2
the school basically did exactly what other schools do , in the best interests of everyone			0
' in a statement , the school said : ' @entity10 is proud to be a fully inclusive school that successfully accommodates students with a wide variety of educational needs			0
' the school was alerted to some threads of negative comments on local social media sites concerning our support for students during the inspection			2
as a matter of policy @entity10 does not engage in discussions or comment on social media sites			0
' we encourage parents who have any concerns to contact the school so we can respond to their individual queries sensitively and constructively			0
we thank the vast majority of parents who have supported us through this period			0
all of our students have represented the school with pride			0
' inspectors visited the school on thursday and friday last week			2
@entity5 's last report of the school , in 2013 , said : ' low attainers , students eligible for pupil premium support and most of those identified as disabled or with special educational needs are not making as much progress as their peers			2
' an @entity5 spokesman said : ' when @entity5 visits a school , inspectors gather evidence about how well individual pupils and particular groups of pupils , such as those with special educational needs , are learning , gaining knowledge , and making progress			1
' @entity5 can not comment on individual complaints			0
