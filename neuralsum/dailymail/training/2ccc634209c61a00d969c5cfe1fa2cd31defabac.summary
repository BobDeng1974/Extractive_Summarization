@entity0 has made a storming start to life at @entity3 and @entity4 has hit the ground running at @entity6 , but what about the players that @entity10 clubs are regretting bringing in ? here , @entity11 takes a look at 10 summer signings who have flopped			1
@entity15 , @entity16 £ 16m from @entity17 the most obvious candidate for biggest disappointment of the season so far , ' @entity18 ' has n't had it his own way on his return to @entity25			1
brought in by @entity28 as a replacement for @entity30 , the former @entity27 striker has played 758 minutes in the @entity10 without scoring while looking disinterested			2
@entity16 have struggled without @entity30 and the injured @entity31 this season , and @entity15 's ineptitude on the pitch and attitude off it have done nothing to help their cause			1
@entity15 has yet to score in the @entity10 this season after his £ 16m move from @entity17 @entity38 , @entity27 £ 35m from @entity39 when @entity27 signed dominant @entity42 centre back @entity38 in what was the fifth - biggest transfer of the summer , many thought the champions had fixed their only weakness			1
but the 6ft 2in destroyer has struggled to adapt , and has been targeted by so - called lesser teams , especially when captain @entity48 is n't alongside him			1
he admitted the @entity10 was tougher than he ever expected , in an interview @entity51 's @entity50 last month			2
' i would say that playing against @entity3 back at the start was n't particularly a typical @entity25 game , it 's the sort of football i 'm more used to			1
' @entity38 , pictured against @entity57 in november , has admitted he has struggled in @entity25 @entity58 , @entity59 £ 10m from @entity60 @entity59 have built their reputation as a relatively prudent side in the @entity10 , so when they splashed £ 10million on a striker , you expect him to fire immediately			1
but that just has n't happened for @entity58 , who @entity66 admitted he had n't watched before spending the money on him			2
the 26 - year - old has scored two goals in 13 games in all competitions and has been linked with a january switch with @entity74 and @entity75 possible destinations			0
@entity58 ( no 9 ) was signed for £ 10m by @entity59 despite @entity66 not seeing him play before @entity76 , @entity75 on loan from @entity78 somewhat of a mystery man in @entity25 football , the @entity78 forward was tipped to shine at @entity75 , with @entity83 fans bemused as to why he was let go			1
but the @entity85 , nicknamed ' @entity86 ' has been limited to a handful of under 21 appearances , and even a change of manager is n't likely to have a baring on his future at @entity94			0
@entity76 was tipped to shine but has yet to make a @entity10 appearance for @entity75 @entity97 , @entity98 free transfer from @entity100 @entity101 insisted on @entity98 signing the experienced defender in the summer after his contract at @entity104 ran down			2
however , after @entity97 struggled at the start of the season , @entity105 and @entity106 have been preferred in central defence			0
@entity97 has been fulfilling his punditry duties but this looks likely to be his last season in the @entity10			2
@entity97 ( left ) has struggled at @entity98 , while @entity113 had his loan spell at @entity115 cut short @entity113 , @entity115 on loan from @entity75 at his best , @entity113 is a winger who can trouble even the best defences			0
but he is most often a sulky trouble - maker who frustrates his manager			0
@entity123 did n't see enough from the @entity42 international , who believes he can one day win the @entity126 , during his stay at the @entity128 and cut short his loan			0
@entity75 rejected the chance to have him back too , terminating his contract , and @entity113 has now penned a deal at @entity134 side @entity133			0
@entity135 , @entity136 £ 3.5m plus @entity137 as @entity138 also moved from from @entity139 to @entity136 @entity141 international vorm would have been high up on managers ' lists when considering a new no 1 after impressing over two seasons in @entity146			0
but he has yet to make a @entity10 outing for @entity136 and has instead had to settle with a place on the bench and @entity152 appearances			2
@entity135 is a talented goalkeeper but has had to settle for cup outings for @entity136 @entity154 , @entity75 £ 6m from @entity155 @entity75 raided @entity134 again to sign the @entity42 striker , but despite impressing at @entity155 , @entity154 has n't scored in 11 @entity10 games			1
the 24 - year - old struggled to lead the line on his own and has been left in the dark by @entity161 and @entity162 this season			0
@entity75 spent £ 6m on @entity154 - who was highly rated in @entity42 with @entity155 @entity164 , @entity59 free transfer from @entity166 the @entity168 striker once went two years without scoring an international goal despite featuring regularly			1
so it is perhaps not a surprise that he has yet to hit the target for the @entity59			0
@entity164 was cheaper than @entity58 for @entity59 but has still flopped in the @entity174 @entity175 , @entity176 undisclosed from @entity177 ' he was n't good enough , ' @entity178 replied when asked why @entity175 had not featured more for the @entity176 , who has now moved on loan to @entity98			1
the former @entity182 and @entity183 frontman seemed to settle in well at the start of the season , but with @entity187 returning and @entity188 on form , it was obvious the @entity85 was n't going to get the opportunity he craved			0
@entity178 admitted @entity175 ' was n't good enough ' for @entity176 and he has left on loan for @entity98			0

@entity15 has n't scored a @entity10 goal for @entity16
@entity195 admits he has found it tough to adapt in @entity25
@entity59 strikers @entity58 and @entity164 have struggled
but who else makes @entity11 's list ?
