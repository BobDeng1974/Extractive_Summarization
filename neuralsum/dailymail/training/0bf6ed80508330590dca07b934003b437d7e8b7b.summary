a techy father has come up with a novel way of keeping an eye on his son as he walks to the school bus stop - a flying drone camera			1
the 21st century solution to the time - honoured tradition of escorting children to the bus stop is the brainchild of @entity11			1
called the @entity13 the hi - tech gadget uses a smart phone and chat software to record images from a lightweight ' quadcopter '			0
once he is safely on board the flying machine hovers back to the family home , ready for another flight the following day			0
posting on the @entity36 ieee site , mr @entity11 says : ' on school - day mornings , i walk my grade - school - age son 400metres down the hill to the bus stop			1
' last winter , i fantasized about sitting at my computer while a camera - equipped drone followed him overhead			1
so this year , i set out to build one			0
' intricate : wires sprawl across the machine from its circuit board compact : the small piece of kit has a main control board plus sensors , batteries , a power distribution board and power controllers for the motors in order to ensure the helicopter flies close to his son a beacon has been fitted in the child 's backpack which uses gps to link up to an antenna attached to the quadcopter			2
mr @entity11 has successfully used the device , but admits there are still some obstacles to overcome to make it efficient			2
he said it has proved difficult to obtain batteries powerful enough to complete the flight when weather conditions are anything other than fairly flat , and wind has also proved to be a problem			0
he added : ' to see the world from the quadcopter ’s point of view , you can put together a fancy video - transmission rig , or just do as i did — strap on a smartphone and fire up your favorite video chat app. ' the motors i got can lift a few kilograms , but my surveillance drone ’s total weight comes closer to 1 kilogram , for a good margin of maneuverability			0
' he used open - source code to keep the helicopter stable in flight and to ensure it maintained whatever altitude the controller commands			0
back from the comfort of his home mr @entity11 can connect to a number of pc - based graphical user interfaces that overlay the quadcopter ’s position and other data on a map in real time .			1
