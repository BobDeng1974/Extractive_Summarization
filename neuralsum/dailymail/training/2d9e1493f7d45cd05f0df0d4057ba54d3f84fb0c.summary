dissociative identity disorder ( @entity8 ) is the most complex dissociative disorder and is also known as multiple personality disorder ( @entity8 )			1
some people see it as a personality disorder , although it is not			0
the defining feature is severe change in identity			0
people who have did can experience the shifts of identity as separate personalities			2
each identity may be in control of their behaviour and thoughts at different times and each has a distinctive pattern of thinking and relating to the world			2
dissociation can affect a person 's perception , thinking , feeling , behaviour , body and memory			2
the impact of dissociation varies from person to person and may change over time			2
how well a person appears to be coping is not a good way of telling how severely affected they are			0
a person 's sense of reality and who they are depends on their feelings , thoughts , sensations , perceptions and memories			0
if these become disconnected from each other , an individual 's sense of identity , their memories and they way they perceive themselves in the world will change - and this is what happens to sufferers of dissociative identity disorder			0

’ a spokesperson for @entity254 , the mental health charity , said : ‘ dissociative identity disorder is the most complex dissociative disorder			0
' you may experience shifts of identity and each one may be in control of your behaviour and thoughts at different times			2
every identity you have has a unique pattern of thinking and way of relating to the world			0
‘ if you are experiencing these symptoms then we would urge you to talk to a family member or friend about how you ’re feeling or seek help from your gp or a psychiatrist			0
' a health professional can assess your symptoms and discuss all your treatment options with you			0
