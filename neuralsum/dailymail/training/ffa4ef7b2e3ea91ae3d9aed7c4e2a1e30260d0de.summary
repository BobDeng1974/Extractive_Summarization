by @entity0 outspoken journalist @entity1 has angered parents around @entity3 expressing her disgust with the ' uncivilised pushchair posse ' , and calling for a ban on baby buggies in public places , particularly during rush hour			2
@entity10 , 42 , appeared on @entity12 's @entity11 to debate about whether or not prams should be banned from public places , in light of research that shows more cafes , buses and shopping centres are prohibiting buggies from using their facilities			1
the childless blonde - who first courted controversy by stating that all women hate her because she 's beautiful - took on broadcaster and mother - of - two @entity27 , declaring that she ' wholeheartedly agrees ' with cafe owners who forbid parents with prams from entering their restaurants			1
there was an ageing population and a business population and none of us could get through			0
' of course mothers with prams have as much right to be there , but when you get a woman behind a pushchair it does become a weapon of mass destruction			1
it 's like the modern day version of a gladiator with a chariot : she is armed and dangerous			0
' the number of times i 've had my shins run into or i 've been knocked off the pavement ... you can say it 's a joke and they 're only children , but we 're a society and we 've all got to share the pavement			2
' @entity27 jumped in to defend pram - pushing parents , explaining that , sizewise , today 's buggies are remarkably modest compared to the enormous @entity42 perambulators favoured by wealthy parents in the early 1900s and before			1
when @entity10 complained that buggies are everywhere - from cafes and buses to shopping centres and supermarkets - and should at least be banned during rush hour , @entity27 interjected that mothers and fathers pushing prams have absolutely no desire to be on the streets during rush hour			1
she said : ' the vast majority of parents are trying to get from a to b with the least hassle possible			0
' @entity1 said : ' the number of times i 've had my shins run into or i 've been knocked off the pavement ... you can say it 's a joke and they 're only children , but we 're a society and we 've all got to share the pavement ' @entity10 also commented that it was ' fair enough ' for @entity27 to have once been asked to get off a bus when pushing her little girl in a buggy			1
she added : ' i was shopping with my elderly gran in a wheelchair recently and there was no question of us gettting into the lift before those women with buggies - and some of them are like mini cars : they 've got drinks containers , playcentres ... it 's gone too far			2
' @entity123 users reacted unfavourably to @entity10 's comments			2
@entity125 said : ' @entity1 on @ @entity11 complaining about women with baby buggies in coffee @entity129 woman			1
' @entity131 said : ' is @entity1 for real @ @entity11 ! ? ridiculous ! ' broadcaster @entity27 , left , said she was once thrown off a bus when her little girl was in a buggy , and @entity1 , right , said that was ' fair enough ' speaking about the ' pushchair posse ' , @entity10 said : ' they assume they are @entity138 of the @entity139 and refuse to budge an inch for the rest of society - including the elderly and infirm ' @entity123 users were not impressed with @entity1 's comments , and took to the micro-blogging site to call her ' stupid ' speaking to @entity146 , @entity10 added : ' all too many mothers get behind nearly 50 kilos of stainless steel and become utterly uncivilised			1
' they assume they are @entity138 of the @entity139 and refuse to budge an inch for the rest of society - including the elderly and infirm			0
' until the pushchair posse recognise they do n't have a divine right to use their ( usually in need of a clean ) weapons of mass destruction on four wheels where and when they please - then calls for them to be banned will continue			0
' i for one do n't want to see them on buses or the tube during rush hour			0
i 've had enough knocked shins , scuffed heels and laddered tights to last me a lifetime			0
' after all the planet and the human race managed perfectly well without them for centuries			0
