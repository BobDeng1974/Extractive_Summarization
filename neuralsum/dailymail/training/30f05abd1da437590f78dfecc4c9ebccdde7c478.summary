by @entity0 last updated at 4:13 pm on 21st september 2011 it weighs six tons , it ’s spinning out of control and it ’s going to plunge back to @entity3 some time this month			1
@entity4 estimates that there ’s a 1 in 3,200 chance that pieces of the defunct satellite could hit someone when it plunges from orbit			1
it would be the first time in history someone was injured by space debris			2
the @entity16 , or @entity16 , ran out of fuel in 2005 and could land on any of six continents			1
@entity4 says it could land at any point between 57 degrees north and 57 degrees south - which includes almost all the populated areas of our planet ( see map below )			1
most of the satellite will burn up during re-entry , but a hefty half - tonne of metal will still plummet to the @entity3 ’s surface			2
danger : the six - ton @entity16 will crash to @entity3 and could land in @entity31 the satellite could fall anywhere between the two latitudes , where billions of people live it ’s being tracked by the @entity37 of @entity38 at @entity39 in @entity40 , but @entity4 admits it has no idea where it will come down , or when			1
it predicts that it will enter the atmosphere in late september , but it could be october			2
the space agency said that the crash site will be anywhere between 57 degrees north latitude and 57 degrees south latitude and the remains could scatter over a 500mile area			1
that means pieces of it could land in @entity54 – or somewhere in @entity55			1
astronomer dr @entity56 , from the @entity31 @entity57 , says the @entity3 's atmosphere slows down falling satellites a great deal			2
he explained that what remains of @entity16 will hit the ground relatively slowly and ' certainly not at orbital velocity of 17,500mph '			2
much of any satellite crashing to @entity3 will be disintegrated by heat , caused by friction with the atmosphere			2
it 's the reason we get shooting stars - created by meteors burning up in the upper atmosphere			2
@entity16 is large enough , though , that up to half a ton will strike the ground			0
it will probably not be in one piece , however : space vehicles experience incredible stress on re-entry			0
the load can be as much as @entity80			0
an @entity82 car experiences around @entity83 with maximum braking from high speed			0
the reason why the location of the crash site is so hard to predict is because the density of the atmosphere varies so greatly higher up , producing different amounts of drag			1
a prediction that was wrong by even a few minutes would mean the satellite landing a huge distance away , owing to its speed			0
however , a @entity4 spokesman pointed out that there has yet to be any reported injury from falling space debris			1
he said : ‘ the risk to public safety or property is extremely small , and safety is @entity4 's top priority			1
since the beginning of the @entity108 in the late - 1950s , there have been no confirmed reports of an injury resulting from re-entering space objects			0
‘ nor is there a record of significant property damage resulting from a satellite re-entry			0
’ this satellite is far smaller than the 135 - ton @entity119 space station @entity120 , which fell to @entity3 in 2001 or the 100 - ton @entity121 that fell in 1979			0
@entity120 fell into the @entity122 , while @entity121 hit the @entity123 and parts of sparsely populated western @entity125			0
because two - thirds of the @entity3 is ocean , space debris usually hits water			0
@entity4 is urging anyone who finds a piece of the @entity16 satellite not to touch it			1
the spokesman added : ‘ if you find something you think may be a piece of @entity16 , do not touch it			0
contact a local law enforcement official for assistance			0
’ it was launched back in 1991 by the @entity140 to measure ozone levels , wind speeds and temperatures in the stratosphere			0
junk yard in space : @entity16 is one of the thousands of objects in @entity3 orbit being tracked by @entity4 , as shown by this computer graphic but now it ’s one of 370,000 pieces of junk floating in space at speeds of up to 22,000mph			1
the volume of debris was greatly increased by a 2007 @entity160 anti-satellite weapon test and a 2009 crash - in - orbit of two satellites			1
the widely criticised @entity160 test used a missile to smash an aging weather satellite into 150,000 pieces of 1cm debris and 3,118 pieces can be tracked by radar on the ground .			0

it ran out of fuel in 2005 and @entity4 has no idea where it will crash land
