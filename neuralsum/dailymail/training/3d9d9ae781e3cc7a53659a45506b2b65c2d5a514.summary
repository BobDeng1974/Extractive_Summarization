meteorologists working for the @entity3 government 's weather and meteorological body @entity4 have been forbidden from publicly discussing climate change			1
a government spokesperson said this week that the policy exists because its meteorologists are n't qualified to answer questions related to climate change			1
the policy is part of a government - wide @entity13 introduced in august 2006 , soon after prime minister @entity16 's conservative party came to power			1
off limits : meteorologists with the @entity3 government are not permitted to publicly discuss climate change ' @entity4 scientists speak to their area of expertise			1
for example , our @entity26 are experts in their field of severe weather and speak to this subject , ' government spokesperson @entity25 wrote in an email to journalist @entity34			2
' questions about climate change or long - term trends would be directed to a climatologist or other applicable authority			2
' meteorologists are among the most oft - quoted government experts and according to @entity43 , half of all media inquiries received by @entity4 are for them			1
however , other federal scientists must seek official permission to speak to journalists and in some cases must have their responses approved by their superiors , as per @entity50			2
as a result of the often lengthy process , there has been a huge drop in interview requests for government scientists from major media organizations , which are often working on same - day deadlines			0
from above : the rule is part of a @entity13 introduced by prime minister @entity16 according to a leaked @entity4 document , the agency has noticed that ' media coverage of climate change science , our most high profile issue , has been reduced by over 80 per cent			1
' critics say the government is seeking to ' muzzle ' scientists from speaking about climate change			1
according to a study by the @entity73 , many federal scientists feel they are unable to speak openly in their areas of expertise			1
' 90 per cent [ of federal scientists ] feel they are not allowed to speak freely to the media about the work they do and that , faced with a departmental decision that could harm public health , safety or the environment , nearly as many ( 86 per cent ) would face censure or retaliation for doing so , ' reads the report			1
' federal scientists are facing a climate of fear , ' says @entity73 president @entity90 , ' a chill brought on by government policies that serve no one ’s interests , least of all those of the @entity3 public			1
' the safety of our food , air , water , of hundreds of consumer and industrial products , and our environment depends on the ability of federal scientists to provide complete , unbiased , timely and accurate information to @entity3			2
current policies must change to ensure these objectives are met			0
' hot debate : environmentalists are against two tar sands pipelines , which would bring landlocked @entity114 's oil to market due to the huge amounts of energy required to extract it			0
@entity16 's administration doubled its pro-tar sands advertising budget between 2012 and 2013 according to @entity122 , environmental organizations say they have also come in for undue scrutiny from the government			2
seven organizations were subject to audits by the @entity127 ( @entity127 ) this year , just before decisions relating to two tar sands pipelines , which would bring landlocked @entity114 's oil to market , were being made			0
the audits are investigating whether the organizations have committed abuses which would result in them losing their non-profit status , which exempts them from paying taxes			0
@entity3 law states that no more than 10 per cent of a non-profit 's proceeds can be used for political advocacy			0
if the @entity127 determines that they have surpassed their advocacy limit , many of the organizations may be forced to shutter			0
' it ’s all very scary , ' dr @entity142 , @entity143 at @entity144 told @entity145			0
' it ’s all about controlling the message			0
in my estimation the government does n’t want the work of environmentalists running counter to their official policies			0
' @entity16 's administration doubled its pro-tar sands advertising budget between 2012 and 2013 , reports @entity43			2
mining the controversial oil uses up a fifth as much energy as it produces and is extremely unpopular with environmentalists .			0

a spokesperson said the policy is because meteorologists are not climate experts
other federal scientists must seek permission to speak to media
the measures are part of prime minister @entity16 's @entity13
