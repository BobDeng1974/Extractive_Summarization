this breathtaking image offers a rare glimpse of a comet hurtling through space and leaving a magnificent trail of ice and gas in its wake			1
@entity8 is currently shooting north as it passes @entity9 - and photographers around the world are itching to capture its incredible green glowing tail			1
the comet is getting brighter every day making it easier for those in the @entity14 to spot , and views of the celestial body are expected to be at their best in around a week 's time			1
the comet , also known as @entity23 , was first spotted by @entity25 @entity24 , who has a prolific record among amateur astronomers			0
to date , mr @entity24 , from @entity28 , has discovered five comets , all using relatively simple equipment compared to what 's found at a professional observatory			0
it was first spotted on august 17 and in recent weeks has been dramatically captured on camera by amateur astronomers around the world			0
stunning : views of the comet are expected to be best in around a week 's time when it will be visible ' from light - polluted city suburbs ' this graph shows how @entity8 's trajectory is taking it northwards outside our planet 's orbit - it will be closest to us on january 7 comets are essentially piles of rock , gravel , and dust held together by various kinds of ice - essentially water and carbon dioxide ice			1
as the comet nears the sun , its icy tail turns into a gas and blows away - due to pressure from the solar wind and sunlight			0
they also release dust and gravel which tend to follow the comet around the sun - and if the @entity9 â€™s orbit intersects this material it results in annual meteor showers			2
as the graph shows though , the comet 's trajectory does not take it inside the @entity9 's orbit			2
at its current levels of brightness , @entity24 can be spotted with the naked eye - although a full moon tonight will make viewing more difficult			0
a comet 's brightness is measured by magnitude and on the astronomical magnitude scale , lower numbers indicate more intense brightness			0
at its current levels of brightness , @entity24 can be spotted with the naked eye - although a full moon tonight will make viewing more difficult it was first spotted on august 17 and in recent weeks was dramatically captured on camera by stargazers in @entity91 , above @entity24 started off at magnitude 15 brightness and has since reached magnitude 5 , the brightness necessary to be seen without the aid of a telescope			0
as @entity98 reports , comet @entity24 should hit magnitude 4.1 in mid-january , which would mean that sightseers could spot traces of the comet ' from light - polluted city suburbs '			1
some observers were able to spot @entity24 in late december as it reached magnitude 5.3			0
@entity24 's striking color is due to two gases emanating from the comet : cyanogen and diatomic carbon , which both glow green when sunlight passes through them			1
according to @entity112 , @entity24 will be closest to @entity9 on jan 7 - after this time , it will start to move away from @entity9 and lose its intensity			2
guide : stargazers hoping to see the celestial body can use this graph to locate the comet 's position in relation to well - known constellations			1

@entity8 first spotted in august by an amateur astronomer and is currently shooting northwards past @entity9
the celestial body is leaving a magnificent trail of glowing green ice and gas in its wake as it passes over our *skies*
the comet will glow brightest in around a week 's time and is expected be visible from light - polluted areas
