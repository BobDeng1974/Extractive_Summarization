non-european migrants living in @entity1 have cost the public finances almost £ 120billion since 1995 , according to a study			1
the report by @entity5 found that the immigrants had cost the country more in public services and state handouts than they had paid in taxes in every single year between 1995 and 2011			1
the research by dr @entity12 and professor @entity13 – which comes at a time of huge public concern over migration policy – sought to put an overwhelmingly positive gloss on the economic impact of mass immigration			1
migrants lining up at the @entity23 port town of @entity24 with some trying to travel to @entity1			2
a new study has found @entity26 migrants coming to @entity1 have cost the country £ 120billion since 1995 headline - billing was given to a claim that migrants who arrived from the @entity31 – predominantly the @entity32 – since 2000 made a net contribution of £ 20billion			1
three - quarters of the contribution – £ 15billion – was made by people born in the 15 members of the @entity32 prior to the ‘ big bang ’ admittance of @entity40 countries in 2004			1
it includes huge sums paid in by the likes of @entity23 bankers and @entity47 engineers			0
a further £ 5billion came from the @entity48			0
recent @entity26 immigrants ’ net contribution was also said to be positive , at about £ 5billion			1
but buried inside the 51 - page report was the calculation showing that , if the time period 1995 - 2011 is considered instead , @entity26 migrants living in @entity1 took out more than they put in for 17 consecutive years			1
for 12 of the past 17 years , native @entity1 have taken out more in public services and state benefits than they have paid to the exchequer			1
millions of workers will have made a net contribution			1
but , overall , the drain on the public finances between 1995 and 2011 was more than £ 541billion – reflecting the significant deficit being racked up in recent years			2
factors include rising unemployment and the large welfare bill during the financial crash , which began in 2008			0
the report ends in 2011 just as the economic recovery is getting under way			0
crucially , this group includes all @entity71 migrants – not just the new arrivals since 2000 , who @entity13 and @entity12 focus upon			0
in understated language , the study reports : ‘ over the 17 fiscal years considered , the amount of public expenditures received by natives [ @entity1 ] exceeds the amount of government revenues they contributed in 12 instances			2
although such is also the case for @entity71 immigrants for all 17 fiscal years , it applies to @entity71 immigrants for seven years			0
’ the explanation given is that @entity71 nationals – many of whom are likely to have arrived from the @entity91 – may have been in the @entity1 longer , have more children and a lower employment rate			0
overall , the net cost to the @entity1 of @entity71 nationals living in @entity1 between 1995 and 2011 was nearly £ 118billion			1
@entity71 nationals contributed £ 4.425billion			0
critics will say the report is backward looking – focusing on the taxes paid by the influx of @entity101 when they are young , single and healthy – but not the future burden their families may place on schools , hospitals and the welfare state			2
sir @entity108 , chairman of @entity109 , said the report had confirmed that immigration had cost the country vast sums over the past 17 years			0
he added : ‘ as for recent @entity118 migrants , even on their own figures , which we dispute , their contribution to the exchequer amounts to less than £ 1 per week per head of our population			2
meanwhile , they have added one million to the number of people on this island			0
’ last night , @entity128 , director of independent think - tank @entity129 , accused the authors of making ‘ shallow calculations ’ to prove their case , while ignoring the social harms caused by mass immigration			0
for example , @entity13 and @entity12 say immigrants have ‘ endowed the @entity1 labour market with human capital that would have cost £ 49billion through the @entity1 education system ’			1
however , mr @entity108 says the arrival of well - educated young migrants coincided with a slump in apprenticeships for @entity1 teenagers – at great social cost			2
there is a huge discrepancy between the financial contribution of migrants born inside and outside the @entity31			0
@entity118 migrants living in @entity1 between 1995 and 2011 made a net contribution of £ 4.425billion			1
in only seven of the 17 years did they take out more in services and benefits than they paid in			0
the group will range from the hundreds of thousands of low - skilled migrants who have arrived from @entity101 in recent years to very well paid bankers , fashion designers and engineers from countries such as @entity47 and @entity23			0
by contrast , migrants from outside @entity101 – most of whom arrived from @entity91 countries – cost the public finances almost £ 118billion and were a drain in each of the 17 years covered by the report .			1

report finds immigrants have cost more in handouts than paid in taxes
non-european migrants living in @entity1 have cost £ 120billion since 1995
by contrast @entity32 migrants since 2000 made a net contribution of £ 20billion
research comes at a time when there is public concern over migration
