by @entity0 published : 21:01 est , 2 july 2013 updated : 04:52 est , 3 july 2013 @entity1 could have been a footnote in the history of grunge : the guy who was kicked out of not one but two of the biggest bands in the iconic ' 90s scene			1
dismissed by @entity10 as a ' moody metalhead ' , and fired from @entity12 because it ' was n't working out ' , @entity1 , now 45 , had his dreams of rock ' n ' roll greatness snatched away as grunge reached its height			1
but he did n't want to dwell on what could have been - or be harping on about how he was once in @entity18 20 years later			1
so in 1993 , at the age of 26 and with a career touring the world with the biggest bands of the time already behind him , @entity1 joined the @entity24			1
this was going to be my identity , ' @entity1 told the @entity36 of his music career in a recent profile			2
@entity18 's @entity39 said , ' we had some great shows with @entity1			1
but then things went south really fast			0
' in a band that was to become known for the dark moods of its front man , @entity1 was too depressive			2
it was @entity1 who paid the $ 606.17 recording fee for @entity18 's debut album @entity50			1
they credited him as guitarist on the album 's notes , even though he did n't play on the album , but they never did pay him back			0
after the crushing blow of being kicked out of @entity18 , @entity1 stumbled into his dream gig - playing guitar for @entity12			1
1989 : a @entity12 promotional shot featuring drummer @entity61 ( left ) , lead guitarist @entity62 ( top center ) , bassist @entity1 ( bottom center ) , and singer @entity65 ( right ) after a massive world tour , @entity1 turned up for what he thought was a band meeting - but instead he received his marching orders			1
it seems his moods again were the reason his band - mates had difficulty working with him			0
' he was funny and witty , and then a cloud would come over him			0
he would sit in the bus and be really mad with his headphones on all the time , ' @entity12 's road manager told the @entity36			2
as a child , @entity1 's moods were also getting him in trouble so his worried grandmother sent him to a therapist , who also happened to be a guitar enthusiast			2
@entity1 picked up his first guitar in the offices of his therapist			2
soon after , he discovered punk rock and spent much of high school playing in bands			0
with the band : @entity1 's temperament did n't fit in with his @entity12 , but he did have the right hair a low period followed @entity1 's dismissal from @entity12 before he picked himself back up , moved to @entity97 and joined another band , @entity98			1
it was there that he realized he needed to do something , ' something impossible '			0
' i was in all the cool bands , ' @entity1 told the @entity36			2
' i was psyched to do the most uncool thing you could possibly do			0
' the grunge guitarist with his head of tumbling strawberry blond curls , nose - ring and @entity109 t - shirts got on a bus bound for @entity24 training camp at @entity115 in @entity116 to undergo the 61 - day training course			2
the @entity118 are the @entity24 's elite infantry unit ; @entity1 was one month into his training when @entity10 committed suicide and his commanding officers and recruits figured out who he was			1
according to his former @entity24 colleagues , @entity1 never mentioned his illustrious past , but somehow it always found him out			1
after his first enlistment , @entity1 's ambitions had n't been satisfied and he applied for the @entity129			1
it was during training that he watched a plane hit one of the twin towers and realized he was going to war			0
war hero : @entity1 ( center , in 2009 ) was awarded the coveted @entity139 badge the @entity36 profile describes @entity1 ' riding horseback with the @entity141 , helicoptering in for midnight raids , sitting at a base for days at a time with absolutely nothing to do			1
@entity1 saw @entity147 tanks rusting in the @entity148			2
he smelled the poppy fields outside of @entity150			0
' in war , @entity1 became a rockstar soldier			0
his cabin is filled with badges honoring his service to his country , and photographs of him with the nation 's political leaders			0
' throughout my adult life i have made the conscious effort to develop three aspects of who i am : the artist , the soldier and the philosopher , ' @entity1 said			0
he left the military in 2006 , and enrolled at @entity169 , studying philosophy			0
@entity1 graduated with a @entity171 in @entity172 on may 20			1
according to a @entity169 profile of @entity1 , he has also worked as a commercial fisherman in @entity175 and for a period lived as a monk in @entity178			1
after his great achievements musically and in fighting for his country , it seems @entity1 is at last sated			0
his next move , he told the @entity36 , may be something distinctly more ordinary			0
' i 'll probably just be a bartender somewhere , ' he said .			0

@entity1 was in @entity18 and @entity12 , two of the ' 90s biggest bands - but was kicked out of both
he went on to become a @entity188 in the @entity24 and then part of the elite @entity129 and earned the coveted @entity139 badge
@entity1 has just earned his *bachelor* of arts in @entity172 at @entity169
