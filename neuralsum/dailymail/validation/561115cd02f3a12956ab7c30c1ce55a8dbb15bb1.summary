police , midwives and campaigners remain confused over whether s o - called designer vagina operations fall within female genital mutilation laws , a group of mps have said			1
the government has previously said the @entity8 does not contain any exemptions for cosmetic surgery and it has no plans to amend the legislation specifically to prohibit female genital cosmetic surgery			1
but in a report on @entity16 , the @entity14 said despite @entity7 reassurances there is still confusion and the @entity8 should be amended to make it clear female genital cosmetic surgery would be a criminal offence if conducted on girls under 18 without physical or mental health justification			1
the government says it has no plans to amend the @entity26 specifically to prohibit female genital cosmetic surgery @entity14 chair @entity28 said : ' the law relating to female genital cosmetic surgery is ambiguous and must be clarified			1
we can not tell communities in @entity33 and @entity34 to stop a practice which is freely permitted on @entity36			2
' the number of cosmetic genital surgeries - or labiaplasties - performed by the @entity40 has risen five-fold since 2001 , with 2,000 operations being carried out in 2010			1
however , many operations are performed in private clinics , which do not have to submit statistics to the government			1
@entity46 is the most common form of cosmetic genital surgery and involves reducing the size of the labia so they do not protrude			1
it is feared that the rise in demand for cosmetic genital surgery is a result of what doctors have called ' unrealistic representations of vulval appearance in popular culture '			1
the @entity14 warned there is a ' chasm ' between the number of reported cases of @entity16 and the lack of prosecutions			2
in @entity67 in @entity68 alone , 1,500 cases of @entity16 were recorded over the past five years with doctors seeing six patients who have undergone the procedure each week			2
@entity28 said ' the law relating to female genital cosmetic surgery is ambiguous and must be clarified ' the first prosecution under the @entity26 resulted in a not - guilty verdict when dr @entity76 was cleared of performing the illegal procedure on a woman in a @entity80 hospital			1
the @entity14 said different authorities , including the director of public prosuections @entity82 , were passing the buck for failure to prosecute @entity16 cases			0
mr @entity28 said : ' the dpp informed the @entity14 that she could only prosecute on the basis of evidence , the police said that they could only investigate on the basis of referral , and the health professionals told us that they could not refer cases because their members were not fully trained and aware of the procedure			1
' while agencies play pass the parcel of responsibility , young girls are being mutilated every hour of every day			0
this barbaric crime which is committed daily on such a huge scale across the @entity105 can not continue to go unpunished			0
' mandatory reporting of @entity16 by healthcare professionals , teachers and social care workers to the police has been introduced to the @entity111 , however , the @entity14 said what happens to those who fail to report a case remains unclear			0
the group of @entity116 recommended that the government set out the sanctions that may apply when a professional has failed to meet their duty , which should range from compulsory training to a criminal offence for intentional or repeated failures			2
some 170,000 women and girls are estimated to be living with @entity16 in the @entity105			0
more than 2,603 women and girls who went through @entity16 have been treated by the @entity40 since september 2014 with 499 women and girls with @entity16 seen in acute @entity40 trusts in @entity129 in january alone			1
more than 200 fgm - related cases were investigated by the police nationally in the past five years			0
crime prevention minister @entity132 said : ' female genital mutilation is a crime and it is child abuse			1
' the coalition government is bringing in new civil orders to protect girls before they can be subjected to @entity16 , through the @entity111 , and measures to punish parents who fail to prevent their daughters being cut			2
' we have also introduced legislation to grant victims of @entity16 lifelong anonymity , from the time an allegation is made , in order to encourage them to come forward			0
our cross-government @entity16 unit is listening carefully to campaigners and those living with the effects of this harmful practice			0
' in addition , we are introducing a mandatory duty on professionals to report @entity16			0
we believe this will provide clarity for professionals on their responsibilities and give them the confidence to confront @entity16			0
it will aid police investigations and support an increase of the number of perpetrators caught and prosecuted			2
' we are clear that failure to comply with the duty will be dealt with through disciplinary measures that can include referral to a professional regulator or the @entity171			0
this will ensure that all breaches are dealt with in accordance with the specifics of the individual case			0
