@entity0 have sacked sporting director @entity1 , while club legend @entity2 has also left his position at the @entity5 giants			1
@entity2 was operating as @entity1 's assistant , but announced he had terminated his working contract at the club in the wake of @entity1 's sacking on monday			1
the club will now discuss the future of coach @entity13 at an emergency board meeting on wednesday			0
he was then announced as @entity1 's assistant @entity49 the swift action follows the team ’s defeat in the first game of the new year against @entity55 's @entity54 , although is also a direct consequence of the @entity58 ’s decision to uphold @entity60 ’s one - year transfer ban on the club for illegal signing of under - age players			1
@entity13 ’s position is not believed to be under threat but a no - show from @entity67 in monday ’s training session added to speculation that the coach has lost the dressing room with players tired of his constant changing of the first @entity74 in a statement released on monday , former @entity0 defender @entity2 said : ' i would like to announce to you that i have decided to terminate my working relationship with @entity0			1
' these three - and - a - half months have given me the opportunity to see the other side of the club			0
i have learned a lot , i am very grateful , and now i would like to experience other things from another perspective and in different surroundings			2
' his colleague @entity1 has paid the price for a failure last summer to effectively strengthen @entity0 ’s defence			2
the club signed @entity93 full - back @entity92 and @entity95 ’s central defender @entity94 but the former has looked hopelessly out of his depth and started only one league game and the latter is yet to play because of injury and needed surgery towards the end of last year which is likely to rule him out for the rest of the season			1
only @entity33 has made more appearances for @entity0 than @entity2 , who terminated his contract on monday @entity0 's squad , including @entity15 ( pictured right ) visited a children 's hospital on monday afternoon @entity1 also sanctioned the transfer of @entity94 , who is yet to play a game for @entity0 goalkeeper @entity115 ( left ) arrived from @entity116 in the summer born on october 23 , 1961 in @entity117 , @entity118 joins @entity119 from @entity120 in 1981 make @entity118 debut in january 1985 joins @entity0 in 1986 having made 239 appearances for @entity119 joins @entity123 in 1994 having made 410 appearances for @entity0 retires in 1998 having made 126 appearances for @entity118 and a total of 833 club appearances for @entity119 , @entity0 and @entity123 honours : @entity129 ( 6 ) : 1983 , 1984 , 1991 , 1992 , 1993 , 1994 @entity130 ( 3 ) : 1984 , 1988 , 1990 @entity131 : 1992 @entity132 : 1989 @entity133 : 1992 @entity134 : 1984 , 1991 , 1992 post-retirement : @entity119 sporting director ( 2000 - 2010 ) @entity0 sporting director ( 2010 - 14 ) there is also a good argument for @entity0 not needing a sporting director now that they know they will not be able to sign any new players until january 2016			1
@entity2 , in his statement , continued by thanking his former club , at which he played professionally for 15 years until his retirement in the summer			1
' i want to develop not only professionally but on a personal level too so that in the future i could perhaps return to this home and give back everything that you have given to me during these unforgettable years , ' he added			0
' i continue to be enormously grateful to the employees , directors , president and to the sporting management for trusting and helping me in a transition that is no way easy for me			0
' above all , to the supporters , who i always felt so close to as a player , and now even since my retirement , i feel that it continues much more today			0
i have been and i am very fortunate to feel so much warmth , for this i can only say @entity162 and that you know that i will always carry you in my heart			0
' @entity0 president @entity165 will speak on wednesday about the decision when he is also expected to give coach @entity13 a vote of confidence but @entity67 ’s absence with a stomach bug from monday 's training after he was left out of the starting line - up for the opening game of the year has added fuel to rumours the coach who took over at the start of the season has lost the dressing room			0
a @entity0 statement on the sacking of @entity1 read : ' the @entity0 president @entity165 has decided to terminate as of today the contract of the club 's director of football , @entity1			1
' the president , in the name of the club , thanks @entity1 for his contribution , dedication and professionalism over the last four years in his role at the head of the club 's football area			2
' despite speculation over their manager 's future , some @entity0 squad members met fans at a hospital @entity1 ( right ) at @entity15 's unveiling at @entity0 in june 2013			2
the @entity93 is the club 's record signing			0
