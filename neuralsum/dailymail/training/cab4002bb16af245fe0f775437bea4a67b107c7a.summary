by @entity0 it 's the tantrum every parent knows all too well - the kicking and screaming when a child is n't paid their pocket money			1
but when ten - year - old @entity9 's father was late in paying him his weekly 50p stipend , the stubborn youngster took matters into his own hands			2
rather than break some toys or sulk in his room , he climbed onto the window sill of the family 's third - storey apartment ... and threatened to jump if he was n't paid in full and on time			1
incredibly , police in @entity20 in south @entity22 's @entity21 said it was the fifth time he had threatened or attempted to end his life - part of a trend being mirrored across the country			2
' i 'm going to jump ' ! rather than break some toys or sulk in his room , @entity9 climbed onto the window sill of the family 's high - rise apartment ... and threatened to jump if he was n't paid in full and on time ultimate tantrum : rather than break some toys or sulk in his room , he climbed onto the window sill of the family 's third - storey apartment ... and threatened to jump if he was n't paid in full and on time he has attempted to take his own life so many times over any lapse in his lifestyle remuneration that his father did n't even come to the scene - choosing to drink rice wine at home instead			1
police said that on one of the occasions when he had tried to kill himself his mother had to give him money on the ledge of a window to get him back inside			0
another time he held a knife against his throat and threatened to slit his artery in protest at being asked to do his homework			2
looking on : he has attempted to take his own life so many times over any lapse in his lifestyle remuneration that his father did n't even come to the scene - choosing to drink rice wine at home instead protest at an end : after some thirty minutes on the sill , police finally persuaded the boy that his efforts were ultimately fruitless and he decided to give up his protest and come inside @entity69 inspired : when he was quizzed about where the idea had come from to end his life from a building leap , he said : ' i saw an adult doing it on tv ' and last month he actually did leap from an apartment building , but his fall was broken by telegraph and electrical cables and he was only slightly hurt			1
according to the father , both he and his wife are ' common workers ' unable to give into their sons endless demands for pocket money			0
' he is always comparing himself to kids who have more and thus becomes extremely dissatisfied , ' said his dad			0
when he was quizzed about where the idea had come from to end his life from a building leap , he said : ' i saw an adult doing it on tv			0
' serial offender : police said that on one of the occasions when he had tried to kill himself his mother had to give him money on the ledge of a window to get him back inside hard up : according to the father , both he and his wife are ' common workers ' unable to give into their sons endless demands for pocket money a baffled psychiatrist in the area said : ' just as children can be conditioned to be violent by playing video games , so they mimic disturbed adult behaviour if they think it will serve their ends			1
it is happening more and more in our country			0
