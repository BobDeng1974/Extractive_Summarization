by @entity0 psychology and security experts are trying to identify ' superpredictors ' among the @entity5 population who can predict world events better than security experts			1
. the ' @entity8 ' has already enrolled over 3,000 people , who are asked their opinion on a range of events and to forecast outcomes			1
experts say they have been ' surprised ' by how accurate the predictions are - even though many of the participants admit they just use @entity18			1
participants have been asked to predict the outcomes of a number of world events			2
here , including @entity25 soldiers with a tank are seen deployed next to the @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity25			0
users sign up online via the @entity8 web site the site accepts any application , but say : ' requirements for participation include the following : ' a baccalaureate , bachelors , or undergraduate degree from an accredited college or university is helpful , but those without such a degree and those with more advanced degrees are welcome			1
' the primary requirement is a curiosity about how well you make predictions about world events â € “ and an interest in exploring techniques for improvement			1
' if accepted , they are regularly asked to try and predict a range of events ranging from political visits to potential invasions			0
predictions are entered online users then compete in prediction tournaments those found to be ' superpredictors ' can be moved to special teams @entity63 of @entity64 has been taking part in the project , and believes the fact participants are under no pressure is the key			1
' i 'm just a pharmacist , ' she told @entity72			0
' nobody cares about me , nobody knows my name , i do n't have a professional reputation at stake			0
' and it 's this anonymity which actually gives me freedom to make true forecasts			2
' according to one report quoted by @entity72 , the predictions made by the @entity82 are often better even than intelligence analysts with access to classified information , and many of the people involved in the project have been astonished by its success at making accurate predictions			1
one participant even admitted ' i usually just do a @entity18 search ' to make predictions			1
the project is even believed to have a special team with superforecasters whose predictions are reportedly 30 percent better than intelligence officers with access to actual classified information			2
the good judgment research team is based in the @entity105 and the @entity106			0
it has been running for three years , but is still recruiting new members			0
the project is led by psychologists @entity111 , author of the award - winning @entity113 , @entity115 , an expert on judgment and decision - making , and @entity118 , an expert on overconfidence			0
participants are asked to comment on a range of areas , including economic indicators the site says : ' we will post new forecasting questions about every one to two weeks , each requiring a separate prediction , such as ' will any country in the @entity134 default on bonds in 2014 ? ' or ' which party will win the most seats in the next parliamentary election in @entity25 ? '			1
' the questions will focus on world events that might be of interest to the intelligence community , so donâ € ™ t expect questions on @entity5 domestic politics , sports or popular culture			2
' other team members are experts in psychology , economics , statistics , computer science and interface design			2
it is part of a larger project called @entity153 and sponsored by the @entity5 @entity154			0
it claims to be aiming to ' dramatically enhance the accuracy , precision , and timeliness of forecasts for a broad range of event types , through the development of advanced techniques that elicit , weight , and combine the judgments of many intelligence analysts			0
the @entity8 project is unclassified , and the team say results ' will be published in traditional scholarly and scientific journals , and will be available to the general public			1
' the @entity8 where participants can still sign up to the project ' the good judgment project is a four - year research study organized as part of a government - sponsored forecasting tournament , ' it says			1
' thousands of people around the world predict global events			0
their collective forecasts are surprisingly accurate			0
' ' everyone has been surprised by these outcomes , ' said @entity111 , one of the three psychologists who came up with the idea for the @entity82			0
