we ’ve known for centuries that man ’s best friend is the dog - right ? not necessarily , according to a latest @entity6 study , which found that lobsters were the preferred animals for men - when compared to the choices by women - followed by alligators , sticklebacks , sharks and eagles			1
for women , meanwhile , the results were a bit more timid - with miniature pigs , cats , ponies , donkeys and chinchillas making up the top five			1
man 's new best friend ? dogs may have once ruled the roost , but now according to a @entity6 survey of people in the @entity31 , men prefer lobsters as their favourite animal - when compared to female choices - which may be because they associate them with fine dining ( picture of red reef lobster shown ) the study involved a poll of 190,000 @entity6 members in the @entity31 , which the company says is ‘ perhaps the largest dataset ever collected of people ’s passions and phobias in the animal world ’			1
overall , when gender is not taken into account , the nation ’s favourite animals are dogs , tigers , elephants , cats and dolphins			0
the least favoured are eels , millipedes and spiders			0
when male choices were compared to female choices , however , there was a surprising battle of the sexes on what the most popular animals were			2
the data showed that lobsters were the most popular animal among men when compared to those less liked by women , followed by alligators , sticklebacks and so on			2
for women , compared to men , it was miniature pigs at the top of the list , followed by cats and ponies			1
as for the most popular animals , the study found that things like dogs and snails were slightly more popular among women than men			2
men were more likely to prefer ' heroic ' , ' aggressive ' or ' creepy ' animals , while women preferred ' cute ' , ' beautiful ' and ' exotic ' species			0
in the episode of @entity93 titled @entity94 ( seventh episode of season 10 ) , @entity91 gets a pet lobster that he names @entity99 , and unfortunately ends up cooking him towards the end of the episode			0
while his actions seemed bizarre , did @entity91 actually predict that the animal was favoured by men ? for women , when their choices were compared to men , their favourite animals were miniature pigs ( shown ) , followed by cats , ponies , donkeys and chinchillas ‘ animals with violent defensive abilities - sharks , eagles and piranhas - are particularly favoured by men , ’ noted @entity115 in an article for @entity6			1
‘ the only mammal in the top 20 most uniquely male animals is the @entity124 , while every animal in the corresponding female list apart from the penguin and butterfly is mammal			0
’ speaking to @entity130 , mr @entity115 added that his suspicion as to why men are more likely to have a positive impression of lobsters is because they associate them with fine dining ' as for why miniature pigs score so highly on female uniqueness , this is n’t because men are particularly likely to dislike them , but because women are more likely to be drawn towards cute animals , ' he continued			1
' we ca n’t tell for sure , but i suspect this is because it is easier to anthropomorphise these animals , in other words to ascribe human emotions to their facial expressions			0
' this chart shows the full scores for the ' uniquely male ' animals , which were the ones that scored especially high with men but not high with women conversely , this chart shows those animals favoured by women , but not liked so much by men			0
it should be noted that none of the animals were ' disliked ' - the survey asked for positive results only			2

@entity6 survey asked 190,000 people in the @entity31 which animals they liked
for both genders the most popular animals were dogs and tigers
but when the genders were *correlated* , the results were surprising
men preferred lobsters , alligators , sticklebacks , sharks and eagles
women were in favour of miniature pigs , cats , ponies and donkeys
