' @entity50 pictures show that women can now buy three quarters of a box of cereal , books , umbrellas and sweaters â€“ all at a special female rate			0
' it 's the prime service you love at a price you can afford when you are taking home three quarters of what a man would for being equally as productive , ' she says			2
miss @entity66 notes that there is also a specific service for black women , who earn 64per cent to every man 's dollar , and @entity74 women who make only 54per cent			0
and while the video appears to poke fun at the current wage gap , the facts behind the funny side of the clip are brutally correct			0
women only : the fictional service , which was created by comedian @entity10 , jokes that females deserve 78per cent satisfaction looks like a lady : this cartoon shows a woman utilizing 78per cent of the umbrella she purchased on @entity5 for women women 's world : this book from @entity13 may be missing a chunk of text , but it costs 13per cent less than the full copy according to the @entity95 , the typical white woman working full - time in the @entity97 made 78per cent of men 's earnings in 2013 , while black women made 64per cent and @entity74 women took home a mere 54per cent			1
