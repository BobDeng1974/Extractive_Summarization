an elderly woman died alone after doctors failed to tell relatives they were ending her life on the controversial @entity4			1
@entity5 , 85 , passed away with no one by her side after medics neglected to consult with her family about her treatment at @entity11 and @entity12			1
last night mps , including @entity15 health spokesman @entity14 , called for an urgent review into the way the pathway operates			1
@entity5 , aged 81 , just before she went into the care home			1
she died at 85 with no one at her side after doctors put her on the @entity4 @entity23 , a member of the influential @entity25 health select committee , said : ' these cases are disturbing , and if families have not been kept informed , that is wrong			1
it undermines the mutual bonds of trust which are essential in the @entity32			2
we need an investigation into this breakdown of trust			2
' as miss @entity5 lay dying alone , staff reassured relatives on the phone just hours before her death that there was no urgent need to visit – even though doctors had already removed tubes providing vital food and fluids			1
her family discovered that she had died only when her niece went to visit her and found she was already being prepared for the mortuary			1
they said last night that they will never be able to stop feeling guilty that no one was there in her final hours			2
the @entity54 has been contacted by several families who claim that relatives were put on the @entity4 – the controversial system designed to ease the suffering of the dying in their final hours – without any consultation			1
some said they found out that their relatives were on the pathway only after they happened to read their medical notes ; and by that time it was too late			2
the process involves withdrawing life - saving treatment and can involve the heavy sedation of a patient and the removal of tubes providing food and fluid			2
thousands of patients every year are placed on the pathway , which was devised in the 1990s as a means of easing pain when it is impossible for a patient to recover and death is imminent			0
concern : shadow health secretary @entity14 has called for an urgent review into the way the pathway operates medics at @entity11 and @entity12 neglected to consult with @entity88 's family about her treatment however , critics say it is increasingly being applied to patients without their families ' knowledge and when they still have a chance of recovery			1
miss @entity5 's niece , @entity97 , 68 , last night told how her aunt was admitted to @entity11 and @entity12 in @entity99 after she broke her humerus bone in a residential care home in february last year			1
mrs @entity97 made the 70 - mile round - trip to visit from her home near @entity104 on several occasions during miss @entity5 's stay in hospital			1
but she had no idea that her aunt , who never married and had worked as a seamstress , was about to die on the pathway and had in fact been trying to find her a place in a nursing home closer to where she lived			0
mrs @entity97 said : ' my aunt was not well and she had a water infection , but i would not say she was close to death			0
we were preparing for her being released from hospital			0
on the thursday i visited her and her speech was laboured but she recognised me and did not seem near death			0
' i wanted to spend the last hours and days of her life with her			0
they could have told me that i needed to come down and see her			0
' miss @entity5 's niece ' i told the staff that i was going to a wedding the next day but told them to contact me if there was any deterioration and that i 'd take calls on my mobile			1
' on the saturday i rang and asked how she was and asked if i should come in , but they told me that there were no worries			0
on the sunday , i picked up my cousin and we arrived at the hospital at 12.15pm , which was a bit before visiting hours started at 1pm , but we went up to the ward to ask if we could see her			0
' when we got there , the nurse said , “ have n't you got our phone call ? we phoned you about 11.15am ” and we were asked to go into the relatives ' room			1
' she then told us , “ unfortunately your aunt has passed away ”			0
when i said surely i should have been called , the nurse said , “ you knew that she was on the @entity4 ”			1
i knew absolutely nothing , they had never mentioned it			0
' mrs @entity97 added : ' i wanted to spend the last hours and days of her life with her			0
they could have told me that i needed to come down and see her			0
' if they had talked it over with me we may have thought it was the best thing , but we were never told			0
i now have to live with the guilt that nobody from her family was there for her			2
' last night the @entity11 and @entity12 admitted that doctors had put @entity162 on the pathway without telling mrs @entity97 and apologised			2
a spokesman said : ' we have implemented a number of recommendations to improve care for patients in the last days of life			0
instead of a single tick - box for staff to confirm that relatives have been involved in discussions about end - of - life care , staff now have to specify what was discussed , when and with whom			0
' mr @entity23 said he would write to the health secretary today to demand an investigation into the pathway , to ' restore faith ' in it			0
mr @entity14 added : ' i have looked carefully at the @entity4 and i support it			1
it is absolutely essential that it is properly communicated and understood by the family , and done in complete partnership with them			2
' i would call for a review to ensure that that happens in every instance			1
