a pregnant woman and her husband were forced to sleep in the car park of an @entity4 motel after the receptionist said he had no record of their booking			1
unfortunately for @entity10 and @entity11 , they had failed to check the @entity13 reviews of @entity14 before they decided to stay there			1
the couple , from @entity17 in @entity18 , may have decided to book in somewhere else had they spent some time researching their accommodation			1
complaints from past guests range from mould in the bathroom and unpainted walls to blood on the bed sheets			1
@entity28 and her husband @entity29 were forced to sleep in their car after the motel said there was no record ‘ i thought i was lucky to find somewhere because it was one of a very few that were available , ’ mrs @entity28 told @entity35			1
‘ i 'm not fussy so at $ 75 a night it sounded reasonable and within distance			0
’ but when the pair arrived on february 21 , they were told the motel was booked out despite mrs @entity28 having a ' full confirmation ' receipt as proof when they went to check in			1
' the guy at reception looked confused and said there was no booking for @entity28 , ' mrs @entity28 said			2
' he then gave me a book of motels in the area and told me i should call around			0
' i was devastated and it was our first night out together without our two - year - old son since may 2014 so it was rewarding but i ended up in tears trying to find accommodation			2
' the photo advertised by @entity63 does n't appear to add up , according to previous guests @entity65 who stayed at the motel with his wife recently said his room had ' wet carpet with a light fur of mould on it ' ( left ) and ' unfinished repair in the bathroom ' ( right ) another guest , @entity75 , said the motel should ' invest in exit mould ' after staying in an ' unclean ' room ( left ) and old rubbish left behind by previous guests the 29 - year - old said she spent the next few hours scouring through the phone book but the couple had no luck			1
' i called every motel , hotel and hostel - while trying not to sob over the phone but every single one said they were fully booked out because of the concert in town , ' mrs @entity28 said			2
' we ran out of time because we had to meet up with some friends who had flown in from the @entity96 and then it was time to head to the gig			0
' my husband bought some bath towels and we agreed it was looking likely we were to sleep in the truck			2
' the couple found a quiet cul - de - sac and camped inside their four - wheel - drive overnight			2
‘ it was the worst night ’s sleep i ’ve ever had , ’ mrs @entity28 said			2
‘ i am half way through pregnancy and my husband is 1.8 metres tall			0
‘ there is n't enough words to describe the anger and upset i felt as it totally ruined what should 've been an exciting and happy weekend			0
‘ to get no offer of help was disgusting , having worked in customer support myself i was in shock			2
‘ but i do feel like i ’ve dodged the bullet after reading those horrible reviews on trip advisor			0
’ mrs @entity28 said she was left in tears after spending hours trying to find another accommodation but had no luck motel manager @entity125 told @entity35 he feels ' terribly sorry ' for mrs @entity28 and has offered ' free of charge ' accommodation			1
' we 've done what we could , ' @entity125 said ' something went wrong on our website and it was something i could n't fix			0
i could n't just ask someone to move out and give the room to her - we do n't work like that			0
' she was never charged when she made the booking but we have already provided her a complimentary - free of charge accommodation - so everything will be paid for			1
' i 'm not in a position to comment on the condition of the motel but all i can say is i 've done what i can as a manager			1
' an @entity147 spokesman told @entity35 there were no records of complaints but the council will be investigating the motel			1
the 29 - year - old mother said it was the first time in almost a year to spend quality time with her husband @entity29 this guest claimed after a ' poor night ’s sleep ' - he experienced ' a horrible chesty feeling ' and the ' taste of mould in our mouths after breathing in that disgusting air ' overnight mrs @entity28 and her husband were not the only ones who experienced a bad encounter			1
another guest , penned under ‘ @entity170 ’ from @entity18 , thought she was entering a ‘ demolition site ’ after claiming she had fount piles of rubbish littered outside the motel			1
‘ worse to come inside , mould in the showers etc. , towel rail held onto wall with blocks of unpainted wood , windows that did n't close , furniture that was very dirty , and yes stains on the linen , ’ @entity170 posted on trip advisor			0
‘ if i had n't pre-paid i would not have stayed there			0
i had to park my car almost up to the door of the unit as i felt someone would hit my car trying to get past			0
‘ then i thought i could take my mind off the situation by watching a little telly with a large glass of wine but alas the remote had no back and the batteries were @entity201 in not allowing for very easy operation			0
‘ re the room service etc. that had been advertised on the website , forget it , if it existed i felt the health department would need to be involved			0
never have i experienced such a disgusting " motel "			2
’ captioned along this photo ( left ) by @entity210 : ' this is not the courtyard as it is today ' while others have found pile of rubbish left along the motel one guest took to the trip advisor page , claiming they had found bloodstains and damaged parts of the motel @entity222 posted : ' rusty light shades in the bathroom ' that did n't work and moulds along the broke - door fridge another guest , ' @entity229 ' , who stayed at the motel with his wife ahead of the @entity232 claimed they had ‘ noticed a strong smell something like mould and cigarette smoke ’ inside their room			1
‘ we noticed one of the lights would n’t work , the fan would n’t work , the aircon [ sic ] would n’t work and we could only get one tv channel			0
there was also a stifling smell of mould in the room			0
‘ we found a double bed had been moved to cover a large wet mouldy patch of carpet caused by the aircon dripping inside the wall onto the carpet			0
@entity222 found stains on her spreadsheets as well as droplets of blood during her stay in november 2014 @entity259 said she had found ' moulds in the shower ' , ' unpainted wood ' and ' windows that did n't close ' other guests found cupboard falling apart inside their room ( left ) and mould and dirt around the fridge ( right ) another guest found a ' mouldy sopping wet bedside cabinet ' and a broken curtain with a missing clip ‘ on moving the bed we found the patch was huge ( larger than the double bed ) and very wet and mouldy and stunk			1
‘ this had been like this for some time because the skirting was badly discoloured and the bedside cabinet next to the bed has swelled up like a balloon and was mouldy as well			0
‘ as a result we woke after a very poor night ’s sleep with a horrible chesty feeling and the taste of mould in our mouths after breathing in that disgusting air all night			1
