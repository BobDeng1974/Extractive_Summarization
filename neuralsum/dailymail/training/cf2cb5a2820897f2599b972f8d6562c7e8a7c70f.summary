@entity0 has issued a ' reality check ' on news yesterday that an asteroid could hit @entity4 on august 26 , 2032			1
the @entity5 found the massive asteroid , called 2013 @entity7 , last weekend			2
the international scientific community has already rated it as one of the two most dangerous asteroids ever recorded			0
but @entity0 said that the probability of an @entity4 impact is only one in @entity15 means astronomers are 99.9984 per cent certain that it will miss @entity4 's orbit			1
a satellite which can spot asteroids in orbit between the sun and @entity4 will be launched into space next month by the @entity24 the newly discovered asteroid made a close approach to @entity4 on september 16 , when it came within about 4.2 million miles ( 6.7 million kilometers ) of the planet			1
it is initially estimated to be about 1,300 feet ( 400 meters ) in size and its orbit carries it as far out as about three quarters of the distance to @entity35 's orbit and as close to the sun as @entity4 's orbit			1
as of october 14 , asteroid 2013 @entity7 is one of 10,332 near - @entity4 objects that have been discovered			2
scientists have given it a danger rating of 1 out of 10 on the @entity43			0
only one other asteroid has been given a rating of 1			0
the risk for all others has been judged 0 , negligible			0
this diagram shows the orbit of asteroid 2013 @entity7 ( in blue ) , which has just a one - in - 63,000 chance of impacting @entity4			1
its risk to @entity4 will likely be further downgraded as scientists continue their investigations massive : the asteroid would strike with 2,500megatons of explosive force , enough to create damage within a 100,000 square - mile radius			1
( @entity61 location for illustrative purposes only ) the effects of an impact would be catastrophic , especially if it struck a populated area			0
if 2013 @entity7 were to collide with @entity4 , it is estimated to impact with 2,500 megatons of explosive power			2
the standard @entity71 @entity70 missiles carries a nuclear warhead with an explosive power of a little over 1 megaton			0
but @entity0 said that with only a week of observations for an orbital period that spans almost four years , its future orbital path is ' still quite uncertain			1
' the space agency expects the object to be easily observable in the coming months , and will be using the @entity80 in @entity81 , @entity82 to improve calculations			0
the asteroid was discovered by astronomers at the @entity5 and later confirmed by scientists as observatories in @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 , @entity91 it said the most likely result will be a dramatic reduction , or complete elimination , of any risk of @entity4 impact			1
‘ to put it another way , that puts the current probability of no impact in 2032 at about 99.998 per cent , ’ said @entity98 , manager of @entity0 ’s @entity99 at the @entity100 in @entity101 , @entity102			1
‘ this is a relatively new discovery			0
with more observations , i fully expect we will be able to significantly reduce , or rule out entirely , any impact probability for the foreseeable future			2
’ the asteroid is much smaller than the interplanetary object that hit @entity4 and killed off the dinosaurs 65million years ago			1
currently , 2007 @entity115 is believed to have the best chance of striking @entity4			2
the 420 - foot - wide object is said to have a 1 in 2700 chance of making contact with the planet in 2048			0
it is the only other asteroid to have a 1 rating on the @entity43 .			0

@entity125 astronomers claim giant asteroid could strike @entity4 in 2032
if it does , it would hit the planet with a force of 2,500 nuclear bombs
but @entity0 says it is 99.9984 per cent certain that it will miss @entity4 's orbit
it added that future observations may rule out the risk entirely
