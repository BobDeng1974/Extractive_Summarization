by @entity0 after @entity2 won the @entity3 at @entity5 last season , @entity1 memorably declared @entity6 were ' in a negative spiral of results			1
' the @entity9 promptly won eight and drew two of their final 10 games and snatched fourth place from @entity1 ’s faltering flops			1
some things in football never seem to change and @entity2 being the laughing stock of the @entity18 is one of them			1
these facts should leave all @entity2 fans embarrassed by their football club			1
they 've been treated to some top quality players down the years , but none of them have turned @entity2 into champions			1
the club has now appointed a manager , possibly temporarily , who , when things are n’t going his way , throws his jacket to the ground and hurls a ball full force at an opposition player - twice			0
i 'm puzzled why the @entity37 are ignoring @entity21 ’s touchline actions on sunday			1
how his players will get any discipline from him is a mystery			2
i suppose @entity21 thinks a few cheeky - chappy quips in the post-match press conference or a random blast at his players will be the answer			2
on top of that , @entity2 have had a player in recent seasons , @entity70 , who admitted he played for the money and football was n't his passion			2
' it ’s a job , ' he said , humiliatingly for @entity2 , especially as they willingly shovelled thousands of pounds into his bank account for several seasons			2
spurs now have @entity79 ; a player who seems to show more care and precision with his hair than his passing			0
he gave the ball away for @entity6 ’s goal on sunday , got booked , substituted and actually contributed very little else to one of @entity2 ' biggest games of the season			1
candidate for worst @entity18 @entity91 ever ? possibly			0
players like @entity70 and @entity79 are revered by some fans because they are so ' quirky '			0
may i suggest @entity2 need dedicated and talented professionals rather than characters ? for a short time @entity97 turned @entity2 into a top - four club			2
they were also @entity39 quarter - finalists			0
it now seems ridiculous that @entity2 were so happy to let him go			2
why did n’t the chairman do more to improve his relationship with @entity97 ? the chairman is the one who can change things at @entity5			0
the focus now is firmly on the stony - faced silent assassin – @entity108			0
is he doing his job properly ? does he have sufficient knowledge of the game to make the right decisions for @entity2 ? how 's my hair looking ? @entity2 do n't need quirky players like @entity79 ( right ) and @entity70 right man for the job ? @entity2 manager @entity21 throws the ball at @entity6 's @entity119 temper , temper : @entity21 threw his gilet down in frustration during his side 's defeat by @entity6 anger : @entity21 has struggled to deal with the pressures of managing in the @entity18 people said @entity2 played well and did n’t deserve to lose to @entity6			1
@entity6 took the lead and let @entity2 have possession knowing they did n’t have the ability to break the @entity9 down			2
@entity2 ' passing was poor , their finishing horrendous and with more penetration needed , @entity21 bizarrely left @entity138 and @entity139 on the bench			1
in fact , @entity2 looked weaker after the changes the manager did actually make			2
it was almost as if @entity6 were carrying out some sort of football experiment on @entity2 , or worse still , they were teasing them			2
spurs have been rubbish for too long			0
what have you got @entity108 ? do you know how to stop @entity2 being so useless ? let ’s see if you ’re up to the job ... in the firing line : @entity2 chairman @entity108 may replace @entity21 in the summer not happy : @entity2 fans protest at @entity108 's handling of the club before the defeat by @entity6 on sunday @entity161 players have underperformed this season and their manager has proved to be lacking in man - management skills as well as tactical knowledge			1
but did you ever see a @entity161 side with such awful discipline ? @entity169 caught @entity171 's calf early on , and was lucky to get away with it			1
@entity173 was despicably late on @entity174 and was rightly booked			0
they gave away three penalties – perhaps @entity177 went down easily for the third , but it was a poorly - timed , ill - advised lunge from @entity179			0
arguably there should have been two more spot - kicks ; @entity169 and @entity182 on @entity171 in the first half was debatable but @entity184 tripping @entity177 in the second half was a stonewall penalty			0
and just before @entity182 ' ridiculous challenge on @entity188 for the penalty at the start of the second half , @entity169 bundled recklessly into @entity171 in the penalty area			0
@entity173 should have been sent off ; @entity179 was dismissed			0
why are well - paid professional footballers at a giant club like @entity161 making such poor decisions on the pitch ? not given : @entity169 ( right ) and @entity182 challenge @entity171 at @entity197 down he goes : @entity182 fouled @entity188 for @entity199 's second of three penalties at @entity197 lunging in : @entity179 fouled @entity177 and was shown a second yellow card fury : @entity179 screams at @entity203 after the penalty is awarded but is then sent off by @entity205 @entity206 is supposed to be a special place , is n’t it ? so should the play - off , @entity210 and @entity212 ’s paint finals all be played there ? i must declare an interest here ; my team is @entity218 , and we are going to @entity206 for the @entity220 final on march 30			1
i have bought tickets already , i will be there with my son and i will thoroughly enjoy the day ( if we win )			0
on top of that , i ’ve seen @entity218 win twice at @entity206 before – we ’ve got a 100 per cent record there , in fact			1
i celebrated both victories wildly			0
but that does n’t change my view that the small - time lower league and even non-league finals should not be played at @entity233			0
i love our striker @entity234 , but this will be his second game at @entity206 , yet he ’s only 21 and has started only two games above @entity239 level			1
been there , done that : @entity243 players celebrate with the @entity244 he lost the final of the same competition last year when he was on loan at @entity249			1
@entity243 were winners that day which means @entity6 youngster @entity251 , on loan with the @entity254 last season and this , has been a @entity206 winner at club level more times than fellow gooners @entity259 , @entity261 , @entity262 and @entity263 combined			2
@entity206 occasions are wonderful , but it should be for true showpiece games – @entity37 and @entity268 finals , the @entity270 play - off final , @entity272 games , and the @entity273			1
for me , working your way through a sea of @entity239 and @entity275 mediocrity should not be rewarded with a trip to @entity206			2
but that ’s the way it is – i ca n’t change that , so i will be there supporting my team			0
if i let my heart rule my head for a moment , then i think it ’s magical that the club i love is allowed to play at @entity206 – i ca n’t wait ! @entity206 veteran : @entity234 will play his second game at the national stadium at the age of 21 in reality though , we all know @entity218 vs @entity296 does n’t really belong at the national stadium			1
a word of warning though : having watched @entity218 put in a totally inept display last week at home to @entity301 – they were so bad i refused to celebrate our goal – i can only hope my team does n’t disgrace @entity206			1
some great players never got the chance to play at the home of football , so it does n’t seem right to me that there are an endless number of journeymen lower league footballers with far less talent and ability who have had the honour and privilege			0
they are lucky guys , so i really hope none of them take their good fortune for granted			0
come on @entity218 ! we 're going to @entity206 ! @entity218 prepare for their @entity244 final congratulations to @entity322 on reaching 1,000 games this weekend			1
but it ’s an empty , meaningless milestone			0
the first 500 games included all the trophies			1
so the 500 since have been relatively unsuccessful			0
incidentally his 500th game was also at @entity329 – the @entity9 lost 1 - 0 to @entity331 ’s side			0
that was just a couple of months after @entity322 last picked up a trophy , the @entity37 in 2005			1
the truth is @entity322 should n’t have been allowed to reach 1,000 games at @entity6			1
no other big club would have tolerated such failure over such a long period of time			0
milestone : @entity322 will take charge of his 1,000th game when @entity6 visit @entity329 at the weekend			2

@entity2 's lack of trophies should leave their fans feeling embarrassed
the @entity37 should be taking action against @entity21 for his touchline antics
@entity161 's discipline against @entity199 was *shocking*
@entity218 might be in it , but should the @entity244 final be held at @entity206 ?
@entity322 's last 500 games have yielded no *silverware*
