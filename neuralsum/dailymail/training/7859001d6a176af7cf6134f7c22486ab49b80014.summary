@entity1 , 27 , made more than ten hours of amorous calls to drug dealers and robbers			1
one prison inmate said he could not forget ‘ walking through those gates and seeing my beautiful gal ’			2
another referred to kissing her ‘ beautiful lips and body ’ and spoke about how he wanted to see the petite warder ’s ‘ size 2 feet ’ in the air as they made love			0
the letters , smuggled out of her workplace , @entity29 , were later found in her bedroom at her parents ’ home			2
after the arrest it emerged she had previously been disciplined for failing to disclose her father was serving a four - year sentence for immigration offences , and that her boyfriend was inside for robbery			1
although @entity1 only admitted misconduct with four prisoners , police suspect she was conducting relationships with a further three inmates			1
her defence counsel insisted that though the letters contained ‘ sexual matters ’ , it was all fantasy			2
@entity53 , prosecuting , said between march and november 2011 : ‘ miss @entity54 developed an inappropriate intimate relationship with serving prisoners on a wing at @entity29			2
‘ they were @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61			0
she was responsible for them at prison and she did not disclose any of the contact , contrary to the @entity65			2
’ @entity60 and @entity59 were both heroin dealers			2
mr @entity53 , detailing @entity1 ’s previous disciplinary offence , said : ‘ her father was a serving prisoner and she joined the prison service [ in january 2009 ] 12 days after her father ’s imprisonment			1
also she did not disclose her relationship with a serving prisoner , @entity73			0
’ @entity1 ’s tangled love life came to light in october 7 , 2011 , when a mobile phone was found in @entity61 ’s cell at @entity79 open prison			1
he had been an inmate at @entity29			0
mr @entity53 said the phone had been in contact with @entity1			1
a check revealed that the same number used by @entity1 had been used to call ‘ a number of serving prisoners ’ including @entity59 and @entity60			1
between march 10 and november 22 , 2011 , there had been ten hours of calls between @entity1 and the prisoners			1
affairs : @entity29 , south @entity90 , where @entity1 shared racy phone calls letters with two convicts as well as a third in an open prison mr @entity53 explained prisoners are allowed to make calls to a restricted number of approved numbers which are taped			1
@entity59 had @entity1 ’s number listed ‘ as his mother ’ and @entity60 had it listed on the system as ‘ his partner ’			2
police retrieved the tape of one three - and - a - half minute phone call between @entity59 and @entity1 dated august 28 , 2011			1
mr @entity53 said @entity1 finished the call saying ‘ i love you , ’ as he did to her			2
@entity1 was arrested on january 28 , 2011 after her home in @entity112 , @entity90 was searched and the letters found			1
the letters from @entity73 were ‘ of an innocent nature , ’ while the letters from @entity60 and @entity59 were more graphic , the court heard			0
@entity1 ’s counsel , @entity119 , said in mitigation the sexual content in the letters was ‘ fantasy and flattery			1
’ judge @entity125 told @entity1 , who admitted misconduct in a public office : ‘ you undertook a knowing and sustained voluntary and gross breach of trust			1
’ until the 1980s women prison officers were restricted to working in women - only @entity134 , male guards could not work outside all - male jails			0
however , since the ban was dropped , that division of labour has been broken down			0
there are now nearly 6,000 women prison officers in @entity142 and @entity143 , around one in four of the total			0
the @entity145 could not provide a breakdown of how many women work specifically in men ’s prisons			0
but @entity151 , editor of the @entity152 ’ handbook , estimated that around 500 women officers were working in men ’s prisons			0
there are very few rules restricting what work female prison officers can carry out			0
they can work in maximum security environments dealing with the most violent and dangerous criminals			0
female officers can not carry out body searches of male inmates , and there is a similar ban on searches of women prisoners by male officers			0
pregnant female officers can be limited in their contact with inmates for their own safety			0
the only other restrictions are those imposed in individual prisons by governors if there is thought to be a particular risk with certain inmates .			0
