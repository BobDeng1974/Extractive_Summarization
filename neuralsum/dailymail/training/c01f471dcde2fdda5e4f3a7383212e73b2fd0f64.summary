but things are finally turning a corner : in july own finally became profitable and the ratings are improving			0

reflecting on those early mistakes , @entity1 told @entity10 : ‘ i have a tendency to look at everything from the point of view of : what is going to be meaningful , and uplift people ?

so we ( began ) looking for lighter fare			0

@entity1 said : ' i never imagined that , because i 've done the opposite			1
i 'm the person that 's taken everybody on the world cruise with their families			0
i 'm not the person who 's laying people off			2
' @entity1 has taken time to adjust to having a smaller budget but has found enough money to keep @entity83 on the channel , and he has been a huge hit			1
