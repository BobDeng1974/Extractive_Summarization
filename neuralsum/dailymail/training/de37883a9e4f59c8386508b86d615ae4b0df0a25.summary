by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 14:42 est , 25 september 2012 updated : 14:42 est , 25 september 2012 ' @entity2 ' : @entity3 , who has escaped an @entity4 to reduce the numbers of dogs he owns because of his right to a family life when @entity3 moved to a new home with his pack of nearly 50 @entity12 , his neighbours were understandably concerned			1
and they claim that their worst fears were confirmed over the next few months when the din from nearby kennels left them depressed and exhausted , forcing the council to seek an @entity4 to reduce numbers and control the noise			0
but yesterday a sheriff dismissed the @entity4 bid and allowed mr @entity3 , who she described as the ' pack leader ' , to keep all his animals			1
referring to mr @entity3 ’s human rights , sheriff @entity24 ruled there was no justification to interfere in his ' family life ' with his dogs			1
she said that while his circumstances were ' unusual ' - mr @entity31 sleeps with all but two of his pets in a caravan in a remote rural compound - his lifestyle does not amount to anti-social behaviour			1
the reclusive 58 - year - old already has a history of owning noisy dogs and was jailed and banned from keeping the animals in @entity42			1
the former @entity44 hairdresser moved to the plot near @entity46 , @entity47 , early one morning in 2006 after fleeing from @entity48 , near @entity49 , when @entity50 won an asbo against him			0
last night neighbours in @entity47 were horrified by the court ’s decision			0
one tearfully said : ‘ i feel let down by the criminal justice system , we put our faith in it , that it would work something equitably but that has n’t happened			0
‘ if he could find a way of living the way he wants to live without disturbing the rest of us there would not be any problem from the community			0
’ the leader of @entity74 , which tried to reduce the number of dogs to four , said he was disappointed by the decision			2
@entity78 said it was wrong ' for the sheriff to to talk about a lifestyle that centres on a man being the leader of a pack of 46 large dogs '			1
it is thought the four - year legal battle could cost the taxpayer around £ 50,000			0
mr @entity31 ’s current home , the @entity91 compound , contains several caravans , and a block of 17 individual kennels			0
there are 46 @entity97 shepherds on the site , which is surrounded by a six - foot high perimeter fence			2
retired husband and wife @entity101 and @entity102 live at @entity105 , which is less than half - a - mile away from mr @entity3			1
they were horrified when he moved in with what they thought was ' a truck load of noisy turkeys '			0
the @entity111 compound where mr @entity3 lives with his pack of 50 @entity97 shepherds : @entity114 claim the noise made by the dogs has disturbed their sleep the @entity118 kept noise diaries , describing how the @entity12 ’ barking disturbed their sleep			1
mrs @entity102 , 66 , a retired teacher , later told @entity121 that the noise of the dogs was disturbing , distressing , disruptive , exhausting and depressing			2
@entity74 carried out an investigation into the noise after receiving a formal complaint			0
mr @entity31 was later warned that if he allowed his dogs to bark at excessive levels , the council would apply for an @entity4 - which it did in august 2008			2
environmental health officers and acoustic experts were instructed to prepare noise level reports and work - out how many dogs could be kept there without causing alarm or distress			2
however , the sheriff said she was bewildered as to why @entity74 chose to rely on a report that focused on a property in @entity140 that was not relevant to the asbo			2
she branded the council experts ’ starting point for noise pollution as ‘ inept ’ as they chose a model which was for rating industrial noise in mixed industrial and residential areas			0
sheriff @entity24 said there were other ' perplexing and baffling ' aspects to their report which called into question its evidential value			0
she also said their evidence was ' remarkable in its disingenuousness '			0
in court , mr @entity3 denied there was a barking problem and said the noise diaries were ' lies and exaggerations '			1
one of mr @entity3 's dogs peers through the bottom of the six foot fence surrounding the compound : a sheriff ruled that there were no welfare issues surrounding the dogs in her report issued yesterday , sheriff @entity24 said there were no welfare issues surrounding the dogs			1
she added that mr @entity3 had not acted in a manner or pursued a course of conduct likely to cause alarm or distress and that keeping his pack at the compound was reasonable			1
she believed neighbours had ' unreasonably low tolerance or unreasonably high sensitivity ' to his animals and lifestyle			0
she concluded by saying : ' in my view ... the respondent ’s lifestyle is deserving of respect whether or not it falls within the legal definition of " family life " and in my considered opinion , there is no justification for interference with the respondent ’s lifestyle			1

dog *breeder* @entity3 sleeps with all but two of his 46 dogs
@entity114 have complained saying that barking disturbs their sleep
sheriff backs ' unusual ' lifestyle , and rules it is not anti-social behaviour
she finds no justification to interfere with his ' family life ' with the pets
