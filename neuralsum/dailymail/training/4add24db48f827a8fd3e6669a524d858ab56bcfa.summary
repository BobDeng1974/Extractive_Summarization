study : pregnant women with high perchlorate levels are more like to have children who go on to score in the bottom 10 percent for iq a chemical used in rocket fuel that is found in some regions ' drinking water has been linked to significantly lower iq 's in the children of mothers exposed while they were pregnant , a new study has found			1
perchlorate , which is also found in fireworks , explosives and is a byproduct of using fertilizers , may cause this by disrupting the thyroid 's normal hormone production			2
' our report highlights a pressing need for larger studies of perchlorate levels from the general pregnant population and those with undetected hypothyroidism , ' the authors wrote			2
the study , which was published in the @entity30 , identified pregnant women in @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 , @entity35 who had iodine deficiency and thyroid dysfunction			2
researches then tested their perchlorate levels			0
three years later they tested their children 's iq			0
they found that women with the highest 10 percent of perchlorate levels were over three times more likely to have children with an iq score in the lowest 10 percent			1
perchlorate is found in around 4 percent of the @entity51 public drinking water , according to @entity52			1
that affects 5 to 17 million people			0
perchlorate is most prevalent in the @entity56 @entity51 , specifically near @entity57 and @entity58			1
a @entity60 survey released in may reported that all samples of fresh fruits and vegetables , dairy products and infant formulae analyzed for perchlorate were safe for consumption			0
the @entity68 tested a total of 611 samples , including 433 fresh fruit and vegetable , 89 dairy product , and 89 infant formula samples , collected from @entity60 retail stores			0
the 2010 - 2011 study found that 65 percent of fresh fruit and vegetable , 87 percent of dairy product , and 63 percent of infant formula samples analyzed were found to contain very low levels of perchlorate , in the range of 2 to 540 parts per billion			1
@entity85 officials have long gone back and forth as to whether to cap the amount of perchlorate allowable in drinking water			1
in 2002 , an @entity85 draft risk assessment found that 1 part per billion should be considered safe			0
six years later , the @entity92 administration decided not to regulate the chemical , instead recommending that concentrations not exceed 15 parts per billion			0
at the time , federal scientists estimated that 16.6 million @entity51 could be exposed to unsafe levels through their drinking water			2
@entity58 and @entity100 in the meantime have set state - level drinking water standards			1
currently , the @entity85 plans to unveil new standards for perchlorate in water in summer 2015			0
rocket fuel : the @entity85 has debated for decades over whether or not to put a limit on how much perchlorate may be present in drinking @entity109 chemical is most prevalent in areas adjacent to military bases			1

pregnant women with high perchlorate levels are more like to have children who go on to score in the bottom 10 percent for iq
the @entity85 has debated for decades over whether or not to put a limit on how much perchlorate may be present in drinking water
the chemical is most prevalent in areas adjacent to military bases like @entity57 and @entity58
perchlorate is also used in fireworks and explosives and is found as a by - product from *industrial* sources , including the use of *nitrate* fertilizers
