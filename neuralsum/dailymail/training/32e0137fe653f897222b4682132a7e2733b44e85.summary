by @entity1 reporter she once called @entity2 ' a maggot , a cockroach and a crumb			1
' this week , he remembered her as ' an impossible person			0
' the woman who became a folk hero for resisting decades - long efforts by big - name developers like @entity2 to displace her @entity13 boardinghouse is now 86 and , at last , has sold			1
the 29 - room property @entity15 and her husband bought for $ 20,000 in 1961 and fought to hold onto went at auction thursday afternoon for $ 530,000 plus 10 percent commission , said @entity19 of @entity20 , which handled the sale			1
bidding started at $ 199,000 , priced to sell in @entity13 's depressed real estate market			1
@entity15 has moved to @entity24 to be near her family			2
and the 29 - room property she and her husband bought for $ 20,000 in 1961 and fought to hold onto is on the auction block thursday for a $ 199,000 starting bid			1
the now - vacant property had been listed for $ 995,000 since september			1
holding out : @entity32 towers over @entity15 's three story rooming house , the decrepit boarding home owned by @entity15 the long - running saga has paralleled the rise and fall of @entity13 's real estate fortunes , which in recent months imploded			1
the decision to auction the property was made by @entity15 's family after they could not find a buyer in recent years , said @entity44 of @entity20 , which is handling the sale			1
the road to the auction block has been circuitous			0
coking first took on @entity50 publisher @entity48 in the 1970s , who was reportedly so angered by her refusal to sell that he started building his casino above and around her property			2
@entity2 , who bought @entity58 's unfinished project , also tried to buy @entity60 's building to tear it down and use the land for his @entity32			1
@entity60 battled with @entity2 and prevailed in a 1998 state @entity63 case that blocked attempts by the state to use eminent domain to condemn the property			2
@entity60 's one - woman battle was closely followed in the press and by the people of @entity13 , where she and her property , sitting defiantly in the shadow of @entity2 's casino , have been a familiar sight for decades			1
triumphant : in this 1997 file photo @entity15 walks past @entity2 , partially obscured against wall at left , in a courtroom hallway at @entity81			2
@entity15 , who became a folk hero for resisting decades - long efforts by developers like @entity2 to displace her @entity13 boardinghouse , is now 91 and ready to sell the modest , three - story clapboard structure is a block from the famous @entity13 boardwalk and adjacent to the casinos , that like @entity2 's , have sought to expand their parking facilities or outdoor footprint			1
@entity20 has been stressing the boardinghouse 's location just steps from a planned @entity96 and adjacent to an outlet mall that the city advertises as a main attraction			0
@entity44 and his associates say that they are confident that @entity13 will bounce back and that the coking property is a great buy in one of the last affordable beachfront towns in @entity105			1
since then , @entity13 's real estate market and casino businesses have faltered			2
@entity32 may close in september , although @entity2 himself is largely divested			2
the portrait of @entity60 as a principled holdout is wrong , @entity2 said , asserting that she had been willing to sell but that they could never agree on a price			0
' a crumb ' : @entity15 had some choice words for @entity2 , who in turn called her a ' difficult person ' ' she could have lived happily ever after in @entity119 , @entity120 ; instead , she was an impossible person to deal with , ' @entity2 told @entity1 this week			1
in addition to millions of dollars , he said , he had offered coking housing for the rest of her life in one of his properties			0
the famously stubborn @entity2 laughed off a question as to whether he would bid on @entity15 's home â€” just to have the last word			2
@entity60 's grandson , @entity130 , previously told the @entity131 that it was n't true his grandmother had once been offered millions			0
he said she was n't opposed to selling but was proud to live in and fight for her longtime home			0
messages left at a @entity24 listing for @entity130 were not returned , and @entity44 said the family had told him they no longer wished to speak publicly about the matter			0
information about @entity60 's health was n't available			0
but back in the day , @entity60 was n't afraid to throw a zinger			0
at the height of their battle in 1998 , the 70 - year - old @entity15 said of @entity2 to the @entity147 : ' a maggot , a cockroach and a crumb , that 's what he is			1
' ' if @entity2 's thinking i 'm gon na die tomorrow , he 's having himself a pipe dream , ' she said then			0
' i 'm gon na be here for a long , long time			0
i 'll stay just to see he 's not getting my house			0
we 'll be going to his funeral , you can count on that			0
