when the @entity0 first burst onto the royal scene courtesy of a catwalk appearance in a risqué sheer dress , few could have predicted that within a decade , hers would become one of the most talked about wardrobes in the world			0
sales of the £ 780 floor - length @entity9 lace gown worn for the @entity11 last night have gone into orbit , as the @entity14 brand becomes the latest beneficiary of what has been dubbed ' the @entity17 '			2
but fashion fans are n't the only one left swooning by the @entity0 's stellar sense of style			1
since her marriage four years ago , an army of @entity24 clones has appeared , among them her own mother and some of @entity31 royalty 's heaviest hitters			0
looks familiar : @entity32 of @entity33 , @entity35 's @entity34 ( left ) and @entity37 's princess mary ( centre ) all have similar style copy kates ! @entity40 chose a strikingly similar dress for the @entity11 , while princess @entity42 loves a bit of lace the @entity17 strikes again ! @entity45 ( far left ) in a similar dress at the @entity47 last saturday lovely in lace : queen @entity34 and the @entity0 regularly opt for black lace , as does @entity24 's sister @entity50 @entity40 , who like her daughter chose a black lace dress for the @entity11 , has form when it comes to taking her pick from @entity24 and @entity50 's wardrobes			1
days after the @entity0 , dressed in a demure blue spotted dress , left hospital with @entity60 , her mother was seen wearing an almost identical frock			0
but it is n't just @entity24 takes style tips from her mother too , and even borrows her clothes			2
one was a £ 650 @entity66 dress , worn by @entity40 to a wedding in 2009 and by @entity24 to another in 2011			2
another dress loved - and worn - by both was a simple royal blue draped dress by @entity73 that made its debut on @entity40 at @entity75 in 2010 and was worn for the second time by the @entity0 in 2012			2
while @entity40 has unfettered access to @entity24 's wardrobe , the @entity0 ' elegant style has also proved a hit with her royal contemporaries , among them @entity45 and princess @entity42			1
like mother , like daughter : @entity32 of @entity33 and @entity40 regularly share clothes , including this hat ladies in red : the @entity89 's @entity88 , the @entity0 and princess @entity42 step out in similar scarlet styles chic : @entity45 has had a @entity24 - style makeover in recent years and adores tailored coat - dresses and patent nude courts snap ! like @entity45 and princess @entity42 , @entity50 is n't immune to the lure of the @entity0 's wardrobe @entity45 , who , pre- 2011 , boasted a wardrobe remarkable only for its normality , has undergone an impressive makeover in recent years , much of it inspired by her niece - in - law			1
like the @entity0 , she loves a tailored coat - dress and an elegant hat , which , like @entity24 , she often buys from up - and - coming milliner , @entity106 - who also numbers princess @entity42 among her clients			1
@entity42 , 26 , has also revamped her style in recent years , swapping frumpy , ageing dresses and the infamous pretzel hat for a succession of glamorous separates and tailored dresses			0
as with the @entity0 , she 's partial to a spot of lace and has also chosen similar colour combinations to her cousin - by - marriage with royal blue and cream becoming firm favourites			0
and it is n't only members of the @entity126 royal family who have taken note of the @entity0 's elegant look			0
others to do so include @entity130 @entity34 of @entity35 , crown princess mary of denmark and soon - to - be - royal @entity132 , 29 , who wore a royal blue dress , strikingly similar to the @entity136 number worn by @entity24 , for her engagment photo			1
glamorous in green : queen @entity139 of the @entity140 , crown princess mary of denmark and the @entity0 in green tailoring going grey : grand duchess @entity144 is the latest royal copy @entity24 , although @entity147 also seems to be an influence elegant : @entity32 of @entity33 , @entity50 and @entity132 , fiancee of prince @entity150 , are pretty in nude pretty : @entity132 , the duchess of @entity33 and @entity152 in surprisingly similar white ensembles @entity34 and @entity147 , both 42 , share the @entity0 ' love for floor - length lace , tailored shift dresses and nude court shoes , as well as understated ' @entity159 ' earrings by @entity126 jewellery brand , links of @entity162			1
like the @entity0 , both come from relatively humble backgrounds with @entity34 enjoying a successful career as a journalist before marriage , while @entity147 worked as a marketing manager for an @entity170 pub. both have won plaudits for their elegant sense of style in the years since they married and the pair have even been known to dip into each other 's wardrobes - on occasion stepping out in identical dresses			0
indeed , so successful are they - and @entity24 - at picking the perfect ensemble whatever the occasion , other royals have begun to take note , with @entity184 of @entity185 , 30 , sporting grey shift dress for her meeting with @entity34 last week that had been worn by the @entity37 princess seven days before			1
the @entity89 ' @entity88 , 43 , also favours a tailored style - albeit one enlivened by some seriously eye - catching costume jewels - as does the elegant @entity130 @entity139 , 41 , of @entity140			0
but of all the royals in @entity31 , the @entity192 royal family is the one that bears the closest resemblance to the @entity0 , with both @entity196 , 37 , and her sister @entity152 , 32 , opting for increasingly elegant , tailored ensembles in recent years			0
like the @entity37 princess , both love a sequin but as with the @entity0 and her mother , lace and elegant shades of navy , cream and royal blue reign supreme			0
flower power : queen @entity34 and princess @entity147 are a match , while the @entity0 opts for a more traditional print top tweed : queen @entity34 and the @entity0 are both fond of a tweedy suit , here in the same dark turquoise shade think ink ! @entity132 makes her mark in black and chooses a similar style to dresses worn by @entity42 and the @entity0 evening glamour : @entity220 and @entity221 and @entity37 love a cream gown - as does the @entity0			1

@entity32 of @entity33 's glamorous , tailored style has proved a hit with fashion fans - and other royals
@entity40 often wears similar looks , including the black lace dress worn to the @entity11
others to take style tips from @entity24 include princess @entity42 , @entity45 and @entity34 of @entity35
princess @entity235 , @entity237 and princess @entity152 all have similar attire
