a 600lb woman , whose eating spiraled out of control after she was molested as a child , was left fighting for her life after she developed a deadly case of pneumonia following her weight loss surgery			1
on last night 's episode of the @entity14 obesity series my 600lbs life , @entity9 , from @entity10 , @entity11 , admitted that she was afraid she would die on the operating table – but it was actually her persistent refusal to address the symptoms of a lung infection that almost cost the 41 - year - old her life			1
' we got her just in time to keep her alive , but its not looking good right now , ' @entity9 's surgeon dr @entity23 told the cameras			1
' she is very close to dying			2
instead , @entity9 was later rushed to the emergency room , where she was placed in the intensive care unit and given a ventilator because she could n't breathe on her own			1
' a patient this size ca n't handle any sort of sickness , ' dr @entity23 said			0
' [ her ] body has nothing left to give			0
' @entity9 's common law husband @entity28 tearfully watched her quietly battle the infection in her hospital bed			1
mad love : @entity28 had to help @entity9 get out of bed in the morning because she was morbidly obese , weighing 594 lbs team work : @entity9 's mom @entity59 and @entity28 had to help clean @entity9 's body and get her ready for the day ' @entity9 is my life , ' he said			1
' she 's been there with me through thick and thin			2
' despite her severe condition , @entity9 miraculously managed to make a full recovery after spending two weeks in the hospital – but sadly her illness was just one of her many set backs			1
when @entity9 first traveled to @entity40 to meet with dr @entity23 , she was told that she needed to shed 50lbs from her 594lb frame before being eligible for gastric bypass			1
' she is physically in one of the worst shapes i have ever seen , ' the doctor said of @entity9 , who was a diabetic and needed an oxygen tank and a wheelchair with her at all times			2
after @entity9 lost the necessary weight , dr @entity23 proceeded with the surgery , only to find in the midst of the procedure that @entity9 's liver and spleen were far too large for her to actually undergo the gastric bypass			1
emotional trauma : when @entity9 was a young child ( @entity88 ) , she did n't have a problem with her weight			1
she started piling on the pounds ( r ) after an older cousin started molesting her when she was only five - years - old constant struggle : @entity9 continued to put on weight , and by the time she was in high school , she weighed more than 300lbs soulmates : @entity28 and @entity9 met when she was 27 - years - old			1
he said he was attracted to heavier women at the time and liked the way she looked instead , he had to do a gastrectomy , in which he removed 80per cent of @entity9 ’s stomach			2
although the procedure would n't be as beneficial to her weight loss as a gastric bypass , it was all he could do			0
@entity9 , who almost cancelled the surgery the night before it was scheduled because she feared it would kill her , was devastated to learn that the doctor could n't perform the gastric bypass			2
weeks later she was deathly ill and fighting for her life , but battling pneumonia gave @entity9 even more determination to lose weight once and for all			1
' it made me realize how much of my life i had wasted , ' she said			0
' i have taken all this pain and bitterness and all i have done was eat instead of dealing with it			0
' major problem : @entity9 , who said she is addicted to sweets , can be seen eating candy that @entity28 had given her bad news : weight loss expert dr @entity23 told @entity9 she had to lose 50lbs before being eligible for gastric bypass surgery panic mode : @entity9 's niece watched her aunt cry into her pillow the night before her surgery because she feared the procedure would kill her she continued : ' i thought if i lost the weight , then i would start to get happy , but its really just been bringing everything to the surface and i do n't want to run from it anymore			1
' as a young child , weight was never an issue for @entity9 , but after an older cousin began molesting her when she was only five - years - old , her eating habits dramatically changed for the worst			1
' i never told my parents anything so the molestation went on for years , ' she told the cameras while crying			0
' my whole life just changed , so i turned to food , that was my comfort			0
' being the heaviest kid in elementary school brought her even more pain			0
family support : @entity9 's mom and sister spend time with her before her scheduled surgery change of plans : in surgery , dr @entity23 learned that @entity9 's liver and spleen were too large for gastric bypass			1
instead , he had to perform a gastrectomy , in which he removed 80per cent of her stomach filled with fear : @entity167 watched @entity9 as she battled pneumonia in the intensive care unit at the hospital ' they would call me fat and say : " you are going to break the desk , " ' she tearfully recalled			2
' and i took all that pain and kept eating			0
' @entity9 weighed more than 300lbs when she was in high school , and she was even heavier when she met @entity28 at the age of 27			2
' i did like heavy set girls when i was younger , ' @entity28 said			0
' i liked the way she was			0
' but after gaining so much additional weight @entity9 confessed that she had started to feel more like a burden in his life			1
@entity28 and her mom @entity59 had to do almost everything for @entity9 , including bathe her			2
@entity186 to @entity187 : @entity9 can be seen lighting a candle at church after recovering from her life - threatening bout of pneumonia listening ear : in order to move past her traumatic childhood , @entity9 began seeing @entity195 , a therapist who could help her with her emotional issues final results : a year into her journey , @entity9 was weight and learned that she had lost 237lbs @entity9 explained that she felt ' trapped in this body '			1
