for a man who has made billions from encouraging the world to share , it was a very private event			0
@entity4 founder @entity3 married his girlfriend of nine years on saturday – in a ceremony so secret that even the guests did not know they would be attending a wedding			1
they turned up at @entity3 ’s £ 4.5million home in @entity11 , @entity12 , thinking they were there to celebrate @entity15 ’s graduation from her degree in paediatrics			1
true love : @entity15 , the new mrs @entity3 , was walked down the aisle last saturday by the couple 's dog @entity20 , a @entity24 sheepdog			2
the couple also wrote their own vows social media : @entity15 ( left ) and @entity3 interact regularly on @entity4 , and @entity3 announced their wedding on his personal timeline married : the couple have been together for nine years , but did not reveal their engagement but instead they were greeted by @entity3 – who famously always wears jeans and hoodies – in a navy suit and tie , and his bride in a wedding dress			1
@entity3 , 28 , and @entity42 , 27 , spent four months planning the wedding , but had not publicly revealed they were engaged			1
the only announcement came after the event – and , of course , appeared on @entity3 ’s @entity4 page , where he posted a picture of himself and his new wife and changed his relationship status to ‘ married ’			2
the day before the wedding , @entity4 floated on the stock market and his fortune rose to £ 12billion			1
but despite this , @entity3 ’s nuptials remained relatively modest , with £ 7.50 meals of @entity58 food from his favourite local restaurant for the guests , who numbered fewer than 100			0
performer : @entity62 , the lead singer for @entity63 , arrived with his wife @entity64 in town and carrying a @entity67 guitar			1
he provided entertainment for the newlyweds , playing ' @entity70 ' dessert was a selection of chocolate mice at £ 2 each , and the venue was the back garden of his five - bedroom home			0
it is not known whether the couple , who met at @entity79 , signed a prenuptial agreement to protect @entity3 ’s fortune in the event of a break - up			0
if they did not , @entity12 divorce law works under the principle of ‘ community property ’ , where anything earned by either party during the marriage is divided 50 - 50			0
ms @entity15 graduated from medical school at the @entity92 , on monday , the same day mr @entity3 turned 28			0
the couple have been together for more than nine years and a source at the wedding said mr @entity3 designed the ring featuring ' a very simple ruby			0
' the guests all thought they were coming to celebrate ms @entity15 's graduation but were told after they arrived that the event was in fact a wedding			1
' everybody was shocked , ' the source said			0
couple : ms @entity15 and mr @entity3 met when they studied at @entity79 and have been together ever since guests : those invited thought they were attending a party to celebrate ms @entity15 's graduation arrival : guests were pictured turning up at the @entity11 home on saturday afternoon mr @entity3 invited @entity63 lead signer @entity62 to entertain his wedding guests and celebrate the ceremony			1
a video tmz filmed outside mr @entity3 's home reveals that he played ' @entity117			0
' mr @entity62 told guests he wrote the song for his own wife			1
in addition to the live performance by mr @entity62 , @entity121 says guests partied to @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127			1
however , the @entity4 family favorite appeared to be @entity129			2
neighbors reported hearing the @entity131 more than any other artist			0
according to a source the timing was not tied to the ipo , since the date the company planned to go public was a ' moving target '			2
private : mr @entity3 is known to be secretive about his personal life despite running a social network drinks : the @entity4 founder ordered large amounts of alcohol in anticipation of the party despite his strong advocacy of online openness and sharing , and scant regard for web users ' desire for privacy , mr @entity3 has long been secretive about his own personal life			1
it was not even widely known that the @entity4 founder was engaged to ms @entity15 , despite the length of their relationship			2
even after friday 's ipo , mr @entity3 remains @entity4 's single largest shareholder , with 503.6million shares			1
and he controls the company with 56 per cent of its voting stock			0
the site , which was born in a dorm room eight years ago , has grown into a worldwide network of almost a billion people			0
flotation : mr @entity3 opened trading on the @entity170 last friday , the day of @entity4 's ipo mr @entity3 founded @entity4 at @entity79 in 2004 , in a saga which would later become the basis for @entity175 - winning film @entity174			1
he was named as @entity177 's @entity176 in 2010 , aged just 26			0
mr @entity3 grew up in @entity178 , @entity179			0
despite the hype over friday 's initial public offering , the share price fell flat by closing bell , finishing at only 23 cents more than its expected opening price			2
millions of new investors will be wary come next week amid fears as the ipo failed to match expectations			0
however , the slightly underwhelming impact of the big day will do little to dent mr @entity3 's mood , considering that he is believed to have landed nearly $ 20billion from the deal			2
he is not alone in striking it rich from the ipo - other @entity4 investors to profit include co-founder @entity195 and @entity197 frontman @entity196 .			1
