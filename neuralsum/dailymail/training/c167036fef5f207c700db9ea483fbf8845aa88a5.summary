welcome to @entity5 ... the @entity3 government made three - quarters of requests to @entity5 to reveal users ' identities over the past six months , the microblogging site revealed in its latest transparency report today the @entity22 revealed details of another top secret @entity25 programme which allows its spies to search through the online activities of millions of people with no prior authorisation			1

the breakdown of the kinds of legal action used to compel @entity5 to release users ' personal information to the @entity3 in the past six months in one well - known case , a @entity48 court ordered @entity5 in february to turn over information about an anonymous account that posted anti-semitic tweets			1
@entity5 , which had initially resisted by arguing that the data was stored beyond @entity48 jurisdiction in its @entity56 servers , ultimately complied in june			0
explaining the numbers , the transparency report says : ' the @entity3 leads the way , comprising 78 per cent of all requests received			0

@entity5 was censored the most in @entity65 , where courts issued orders on nine occasions to remove a total of 39 defamatory tweets			2
increasing pressure : how the number of information requests has increased over the three transparency reports published since january 2012 - not including requests made under the @entity19 , which the firm is banned from revealing			1
governments usually want the email or ip address linked to a particular account source : @entity5 transparency report transparency reports such as the one published semi-annually by @entity5 have been a particularly contentious issue in @entity102 in the wake of a series of leaks by former security contractor @entity106			2
he alleged that major service providers including @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 systematically pass along huge troves of user data to the @entity25			0
the companies all deny the scope of mr @entity106 's allegations			0

the majority of the requests come in the form of court - issued subpoenas , @entity5 said .			0

@entity3 government made *902* requests for @entity5 users ' personal information between january and june
the total could be much higher since the @entity102 firm is banned from revealing requests made under the @entity19
@entity61 came in second , with 87 requests , followed by the @entity69 , with 26 requests , then @entity65 , with 22
