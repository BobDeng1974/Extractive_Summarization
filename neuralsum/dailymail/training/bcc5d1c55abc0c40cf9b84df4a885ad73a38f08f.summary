more than four years since the lender had to be rescued by @entity18 and a massive government bailout , the ‘ reckless ’ bankers at the top have been slated in an official report into the debacle			1
but as the blame game escalated today , former @entity23 treasury minister @entity22 took aim at @entity26 , claiming the former pm who gave him a job in government ' got it wrong ' on opposing tougher rules in the @entity8			1
the government ’s @entity32 examined the roles played by former @entity3 chairman @entity35 and former chief executives sir @entity36 and @entity38 , and its damning report today accuses them of presiding over a lending spree which led to the bank ’s downfall at the height of the financial crisis in 2008			1
like @entity45 , @entity3 – created in 2001 by a merger of @entity47 and @entity48 – fell to the brink of collapse after relying on risky short - term loans from other banks to fuel its own lending to customers			2
when banks became too scared to lend to each other during the financial crisis in 2008 , @entity3 – saddled with £ 238billion of debt – had to be rescued by @entity18			1
all three men at the top of the company have moved on to lucrative positions since leaving @entity3 , but the commission found their actions so ‘ deluded ’ it has called on the @entity8 watchdog to consider banning them from working in the financial sector ever again			1
it also singled out former chairman @entity35 as being ‘ incapable of facing up to the reality of what placed the bank in jeopardy ’			1
in its devastating report , the @entity32 says : last night critics also called for @entity35 and sir @entity36 to be stripped of their honours , after former @entity75 chief executive @entity74 was relieved of his knighthood last year			1
@entity77 , the former head of risk at @entity3 who was sacked in 2004 shortly after he raised the alarm on its reckless lending , said : ‘ these former bosses have been proved to be incompetent and willfully reckless , maybe even dishonest			1
' they need to be stripped of their knighthoods and peerages			0
’ he added : ‘ we ’ve got here very rich people with great power who have not been held to account – finally someone from the establishment has taken off their gloves and is telling it how it is			0
it says : ‘ the @entity104 was ‘ not so much the dog that did n’t bark as the dog barking up the wrong tree			0
’ @entity22 , a former @entity114 executive brought appointed city minister by mr @entity26 in 2008 , praised the ' brilliant ' and ' forensic ' report but said politicians made a mistake in opposing stricter regulation of the industry			1
@entity22 said : ' i was n't in the government at the time , but i probably was part of a consensus that missed what was happening			0
' @entity26 was wrong in what he said ; his judgement has proven to be wrong , and i ’ll put my hand up and say that i was with the consensus in thinking that the @entity8 was doing probably quite a good job , ' he told @entity131			2
' i had been on the court of the @entity133 at that time and had been urging the governor to look at the issues of risk and poor risk management			0
but i think @entity26 got it wrong			0
' shareholders , including pension savers , have seen their investments wiped out , while more than 35,000 staff at @entity18 and @entity3 have lost their jobs since the bailout in 2008			2
bailed out : during the financial crisis in 2008 , @entity145 saddled with £ 238billion of debt ¿ had to be rescued by @entity18 @entity148 mp , chairman of the @entity32 , describes ‘ the history of @entity3 as a manual of bad banking ’			1
he added : ‘ consumers and the wider economy , as well as shareholders and taxpayers , have paid a heavy price for the blunders of the @entity3 board			0
’ in its 90 - page report , the commission catalogues the ‘ toxic ’ and ‘ incompetent ’ decisions made by the management at @entity3			2
the report added : ‘ we are shocked and surprised that even after the ship has run aground , so many of those who were on the bridge still seem so keen to congratulate themselves on their navigational skills			0
’ the @entity32 criticises the regulator for only punishing former director @entity172			0
known as the banker to the stars , @entity172 headed the corporate division which dished out huge loans			0
he was fined £ 500,000 last year and received a lifetime ban from working in the @entity8			2
the @entity104 has this week been replaced by two new watchdogs , the @entity179 and the @entity133 ’s @entity180			0
a spokesman said : ‘ the government has done away with the discredited system that failed to sound the alarm as the financial system went wrong , and put in its place a new system that puts the @entity133 back in charge			0
’ lord @entity35 former @entity3 chairman @entity35 is accused by the @entity189 of being ‘ delusional ’ and ‘ incapable of facing the realities of what placed the bank in jeopardy ’			1
a series of telling exchanges between the 67 - year - old peer – who is a friend of @entity198 – and the @entity8 watchdog shortly after the run on @entity45 in september 2007 , are highlighted in the @entity32 ’s report			1
when asked how @entity3 was coping with the crisis on november 13 , 2007 , @entity35 insisted that the management team had scaled - back its high - risk behaviour			2
‘ without wishing to sound hubristic , management has done a superb job - a - job ( sic ) that started five years ago … ’ , he said			0
@entity35 also accuses the @entity104 of being ‘ paranoid ’ about the health of @entity3 , adding on march 17 , 2008 , just months before the lender ’s collapse : ‘ my soberly considered view is that given the extraordinary external environment , @entity3 in an admittedly uncertain and worrying world is in as secure a position as it could be			1
’ the @entity215 - educated peer , who once described himself as ‘ an unreconstructed 1960s @entity217 - reading liberal ’ and an ‘ intellectual snob ’ , received £ 815,000 in annual pay and perks at @entity3			2
but despite this , in december he stunned the @entity32 by claiming he only worked there part time and was not responsible for its risky lending			0
@entity32 member and former chancellor @entity225 accused him of ‘ living in cloud cuckoo land ’			0
despite @entity35 ’s attempts to portray himself as a fringe player in the downfall of @entity3 , the @entity32 points out he was at the helm from ‘ its birth to its death			2
’ the keen violinist became chairman of @entity47 in 1999 and assumed the top role two years later when it merged with @entity48			0
since leaving @entity3 after it was rescued by @entity18 , @entity35 has worked for a private equity firm and he recently quit as a non-executive directorship of a venture capital firm based in tax haven @entity240 .			1
