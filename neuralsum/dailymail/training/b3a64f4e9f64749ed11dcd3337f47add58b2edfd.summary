it 's hard to compete with the stunning footage taken by astronauts orbiting @entity3			0
now , @entity4 plans to make the videos even better by showing a series of tours around the @entity8 in @entity9			1
in a newly - released video , crew members submerge a @entity13 camera in a water bubble which then floats around the @entity8 in microgravity			1
separate footage , shot by astronaut @entity18 in 2012 , takes the viewer through a tour of the topsy - turvy world of the @entity8 in the gym area for example , the treadmill sticks out from the wall while to reach the viewing station you have to float upside down			1
the most impressive views come when @entity18 holds the camera towards a window to capture views of a @entity25 soyuz capsule docked to the station			1
a stunning view of @entity3 from the @entity8 captured by astronaut @entity18 using a £ 13,000 ( $ 21,000 ) 3d camera to view both videos in @entity9 you need to use red - blue stereoscopic vision glasses			1
@entity4 says these are the first in a series of @entity56 , as the cameras they use to take the footage fare better in space			0
this is because radiation in space damages ordinary cameras , burning out thousands of pixels - enough to make them fail every eight to 12 months			2
but the £ 13,000 ( $ 21,000 ) 3d camera brought aboard @entity8 in 2011 has remained largely undamaged through the years			1
a @entity67 photobombed astronauts making repairs to the @entity70 ( @entity8 ) last month - setting off a wild frenzy of speculation online			1
the spooky incident happened on 7 october , when flight engineers @entity30 of @entity4 and @entity31 of the @entity75 conducted a spacewalk outside the @entity8 to fix an electrical problem			2
in video shot by @entity4 and uploaded to @entity79 , the @entity67 can be seen hovering just for a few seconds behind the astronauts , before the camera cuts to another angle			1
as always , the size and shape of the mysterious craft could not be made out and of course , the footage appeared grainy			0
the @entity67 appears during the video at around the 1:50 minute mark and the apparently elliptical craft hovers a short distance behind one the astronauts			2
according to the the examiner , one possible explanation for the @entity67 is that it could be one of two resupply craft that visited the @entity8 but most experts agreed it was just the sun 's glare glinting in the camera			2
' shooting in @entity9 has n't changed much in 50 or 60 years , ' said @entity103 , manager for @entity4 's @entity104			0
' the camera still has two distinct left and right lenses , but now we record to two separate flash memory cards , one for the left camera eye and one for the right			0
' we do n't have to transmit taped footage and re-record it here			0
we can simply download an exact copy of those digital files to the ground , merge them in our editing software here , and create the same @entity117 they had in orbit			0
' mr @entity103 and his team are now planning to send up a camera that could shoot nearly six times the resolution of a hd camera , encouraging the crew to record more video to share with the public			0

in one video , astronauts submerge a @entity13 camera in a water bubble
bubble then floats around international space station in microgravity
another video shows @entity8 *interior* and views of a @entity25 @entity146 capsule
to see videos in @entity9 , you need to use red - blue stereoscopic glasses
