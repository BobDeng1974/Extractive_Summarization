by @entity0 a mother of two buried what she thought was the family cat after finding him dead outside her house - only to realise hours later that their pet was still alive			1
@entity8 found the dead tabby - which looks exactly like her own cat , @entity11 , on the street near her home in @entity14 , @entity15			1
just hours after the discovery she had buried the animal in her garden , and said a fond farwell to her companion of seven years			2
mistake : @entity8 , left , found a dead cat which looked exactly like her beloved tabby @entity11 , right , on the street in @entity14 , @entity15 but , bizarrely , she then heard @entity11 purring nearby , and was stunned to realise that he had been safe and well all along			1
ms @entity8 said : ' i thought he had been resurrected and then i thought " oh no , i have buried the wrong cat " '			1
' i gave it such a lovely burial so in a way whoever ’s cat it was , at least they know it was lovingly buried '			1
she continued : ' a woman knocked at the front gates saying a cat had been hit right outside my door			2
it was n’t her that hit it but she wanted to let me know			0
' there ’s not many cats by us and i have never seen another tabby cat around here			2
it looked exactly like mine - it was the same size and everything			0
i was pretty shocked as he never goes near the road			0
' ms @entity8 is now appealing to find the owner of the cat , so they can be told what happened to their pet			1
she said : ' we put him in a blanket			0
it was n’t until about an hour later that i heard my cat meow			0
he was walking from the very place i had just buried him			0
' i gave it such a lovely burial so in a way whoever ’s cat it was , at least they know it was lovingly buried '			2
now she hopes to track down the owner so they can know what has happened to their pet .			0

@entity8 , a mother of two , found a dead cat outside her home
it looked the same as her pet tabby @entity11 , so she *quickly* buried it
but when @entity11 made a *surprise* *appearance* she realised her mistake
