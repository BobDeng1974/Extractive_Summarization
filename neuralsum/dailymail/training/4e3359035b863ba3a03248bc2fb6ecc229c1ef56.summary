the bouncer has been a staple of cricket since @entity5 ' the @entity1 ' @entity0 is said to have parted @entity7 's beard in the earliest of @entity9 battles - but the tragic passing of @entity11 has even @entity12 , among the best exponents of the short ball , unsure when it will be a part of the game again			1
asked by @entity16 , what he thought will happen to the often intimidatory clashes between fast man and top - line batter , @entity12 said : ' i ca n’t begin to think for the current players but certainly the tragic passing of @entity24 will be on everyone ’s mind for a little while			1
' ' different people will handle it in different ways and it may take someone a little longer to get over it			0
@entity11 was brought into the @entity43 test team by the selection panel which included @entity12 @entity11 in typical attacking style against @entity46 in last season 's third test at the @entity49 @entity11 salutes the crowd after scoring a century during the third cricket test against @entity46 in @entity52 in september of 2011 @entity11 , 53 , is recognised one of @entity55 's all - time great fast bowlers			1
a colourful character who played 53 tests for @entity55 and claimed 212 wickets during a 10 - year international career			0
@entity12 was a renowned personality of the game with as much a combative streak on the pitch as a soft heart he showed off it - and while he feels the gladiatorial nature will return to the @entity67 arena , he 's unsure when that will happen			1
' it is a part of the great game and again it ’s going to affect people it in different ways and certainly time will tell but it ’s hard to imagine that bowlers , over time , are n’t going to resort to the bouncer , ' he said			1
' it ’s about taking a wicket and it ’s about planting the seed of doubt but by no means , as a bowler , do you think that you ’re going to hit someone or hurt someone			0
' i ’d suggest fast bowlers will be very mindful of the damage they can do			1
' the man who once famously knocked the cap of @entity92 legend sir @entity91 during a test match in the @entity94 added : ' as a fast bowler we are not trying to hit a batsman or hurt a batsman , we ’re trying to take wickets so when you bowl a bouncer you are looking for a glove through to the wicket - keeper or possibly a catch down at deep square leg or deep fine leg , so it ’s not about hitting batsmen it ’s about taking their wicket			1
' ' certainly it going to be in the back of people ’s minds for a little while everyone is going to be different so it ’s a case of seeing what comes of it , ' he said			1
of the bouncer , @entity121 said : ' it ’s about taking a wicket and it ’s about planting the seed of doubt but by no means , as a bowler , do you think that you ’re going to hit someone or hurt someone			2

@entity11 in dashing action during his final innings for @entity55 versus @entity138 @entity12 thoughts turned to @entity140 : ' my heart goes out to him , a young man early in his career , a promising young bowler			1
' ' again i have met him a couple of times , i do n’t know him all that well but i could n’t even begin to imagine how he ’s feeling or what he ’s going through			0
' it ’s up to the individual and possibly time , you hope that he ( @entity140 ) does n’t hold himself to blame because it was just a tragic incident			0
' many bowlers have run in , over time , bowling short balls at batsmen and have hit batsmen and been worried about it			2
it ’s very , very , tough for him - there ’s no doubt about that - i ca n’t even begin to imagine			0
' ' my heart goes out to him , a young man early in his career , a promising young bowler , ' @entity12 said of @entity140			2
' you hope that he does n’t hold himself to blame because it was just a tragic incident			0
' he told @entity16 that ' there has not been a more sad and sombre time '			0
' when @entity24 got hit last week , you know that it was going to be fairly critical when three games of cricket are called off as a result			2
' since his passing on thursday just the outpouring of grief and feeling of sadness , i ca n’t remember anything like it in any sport , to be honest			2
' just a young man taken so tragically , obviously he had a big future – to have played 26 test matches at the age of 25 , to have accomplished what he had accomplished he was a very promising player and certainly the @entity43 selectors invested a fair bit of time on him and the view was that he was going to play a very big part in the cricket going forward			0
' @entity12 has turned his hand to writing and acting in his post-cricket career post-retirement @entity12 played his part as an @entity43 selector and was part of the panel which brought @entity11 into the international fold			1
since then he has turned his hand variously to writing , including his new book ' @entity202 ' , as well as some acting and television work			0
' i ’ve made a living out of cricket and while i have n’t played for 20 years – you can go deep into it and cricket has given me the life i ’ve got , ' @entity12 said			1
' i ’m the first to put my hand up and say i was very fortunate with the way that i was seen as a cricketer and to go out and about now and be recognised is great			0

@entity11 plays another trademark shot for @entity55 in the test match against @entity46 in @entity216			2
