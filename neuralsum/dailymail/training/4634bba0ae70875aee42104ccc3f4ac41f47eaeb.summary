a new review site will speak on behalf of the animals at wildlife attractions around the world and give @entity5 - style ratings to the best and worst of them			1
@entity7 has launched @entity8 to provide assessments of tourist parks that feature animals , from giants such as @entity13 to small koala petting parks			1
@entity15 , care for the @entity18 's right - tourism campaign manager , said : ' most people who visit zoos and animal attractions wo n't bother to check reviews online , but those who do will most likely check out the @entity5 and @entity24 reviews - these can be a great measure in many ways , but when it comes to animal welfare , they are n't always accurate			1
' the @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity29 was given a positive appraisal on @entity8 the care for the @entity18 's right - tourism initiative looks at animal welfare in interactive wildlife attractions @entity8 is starting in @entity29 with ten reviews of some of the most popular animal attractions and zoos in a country that has a notoriously poor reputation for animal welfare			1
ratings range from ' best in class ' to ' unacceptable '			1
' some of the tiger attractions in @entity29 are a case in point , ' @entity15 says			1
' these places will get lots of five - star reviews because people get to meet tigers – how cool is that ? but often these reviewers wo n't see the chains holding the tigers down , the sticks that hit them or the tiny enclosures they are kept in			1
' @entity8 aims to supplement these reviews by focusing purely on the animal welfare side of things			1
it 's an internet - based review system – like @entity5 , we 're not actually visiting these places , we 're relying on the information available in reviews , in blogs and news stories , and on websites			1
we 're basically doing the research that anyone could do – but that most do n't			0
' major attractions including @entity13 will come under the microscope in the @entity5 - style site @entity8 looks behind the marketing and assesses attractions back on real experiences the initiative aims to reward places that do the right thing with positive publicity , and steer tourists away from the places that do n't			1
' it 's sometimes easy to point out what people should n't do , but they also want to know what they can do , for example how do they see elephants without taking part in an elephant trek , which can be harmful ? ' says @entity15			0
' @entity8 will enable us to flag up the best in class , and point tourists towards them			1
by doing that , and by warning people of the zoos or animal attractions with the poorest conditions , we can not only help tourists do the right thing , but ultimately cause a shift in behaviour and understanding which will lead to improved conditions for the animals , which is the whole point of doing this			1
' ' a lot of zoos say they do a lot of work in terms of conservation – but do they really ? and are the interactions with animals , for example , done in the best interests of the animals and education , or purely for entertainment ? ' so yes , we ’ll be looking at @entity13 , @entity128 and so on			2
if they truly deserve the best in class review , then they ’ll get it ; but if there are flaws that people need to know about then we ’ll point them out too			2
' a dog , a tiger and a pig share an enclosure at @entity141 , which @entity8 says should be avoided best in class @entity30 : ' overall this is a seemingly incredible place to support where you can to see “ happy ” elephants			1
if you believe that animals have the right to live a peaceful and natural ( as best as can be afforded ) life , free from fear or pain or distress then this would be a place to go to in @entity29			1
' average @entity155 , @entity156 : the animal ‘ shows ’ draw a lot of praise , but here is where problems occur			2
while elephant parades , dolphin shows and orangutan boxing may please the customers , they are hiding almost certain animal cruelty			2
while orangutans hitting each other is more obviously abusive , tourists will not see the violent and cruel training methods that must be used to ‘ train ’ an elephant			0
there is no indication that @entity155 is any different			0
best in class @entity179 ’s @entity178 : ' a caring and loving sanctuary that strives to provide the best life they can for rescued elephants			2
they have fields and forests that the elephants wander around and actively encourage them to form herds and breed			0
their goal is to set up a reserve for the elephants to be released into			0
average @entity194 : @entity195 states that it was the first elephant camp in @entity29 to achieve international accreditation for animal safety and welfare , but there is significant room for improvement			1
despite presenting itself as ‘ a new - age elephant camp which gives … visitors a real glimpse into the lives and facts about elephants ’ , the camp prioritises ' entertainment ’ ( unnatural animal behaviours ) over educational , conservational or animal welfare goals			1
@entity30 : ' overall this is a seemingly incredible place to support where you can to see “ happy ” elephants			0

@entity247 : this reviewer would warn against this zoo and suggest that sanctuaries and reserves are more worthy of your money			0
that said , if you wish to visit a zoo whilst in @entity29 then this would be better than most of the others			1
animals are allowed to wander rather than being in small cages , and there is a focus on studying the animals and reintroducing them to the wild			0
however there are animal shows , which can often lead to cruelty			2
poor @entity269 , @entity31 : tourists searching online for reviews of the @entity269 will be greeted with many five - star reviews , however , further research shows that the animal welfare standards may not be as high as they first appear			1
although @entity269 seems preferable over @entity276 , there is still much cause for concern over animal welfare			2
unacceptable @entity276 : the @entity8 score is perhaps higher than it could have been , due to good reviews on @entity5 and @entity24			1
it is obvious that many people love the @entity276 as it gives them the chance to get close to the tigers			0
many claim not to see evidence of mistreatment or cruelty			0
however , focusing purely on animal welfare criteria , the @entity276 seems to deserve an unacceptable rating , as the conditions of the tigers is of extreme concern			2
@entity141 : tourists searching online for reviews of the @entity141 will be greeted with many positive reviews ; however a greater number speak of the unsanitary conditions the animals live in , the rough handling of tiger cubs and the evident fear and intimidation of tigers during the shows			0
these conditions and the treatment of the animals are of huge concern to animal welfare experts and wildlife charities , and therefore , we recommend that @entity141 should be avoided			0
@entity313 and @entity314 : the welfare of the animals here appears secondary to making money and entertaining the visitors			0
no education , conservation or reintroductions are performed by the zoo in direct contradiction of the principles of “ ethical zoos ”			0
the relatively high score is more indicative of lack of internet exposure than positive aspects of the animals ' welfare			0
@entity331 : one of the most popular attractions in @entity29 , but by all accounts it ’s a horrific place for the animals , with poor conditions and severe abuse reported			1
crocodiles were found to have piled up due to lack of space while tigers and elephants were chained and drugged for the shows			0
animals were also found to have severely abused for the photographs			0
reviewers strongly urge this zoo to close down until its situation is improved			0
a crocodile ' show ' at @entity331			0
