if you have ever been embarrassed by an unflattering or too revealing picture posted online , @entity0 , a new @entity1 app , could be the answer to your prayers			1
enter : the self - destructing photograph			1
@entity0 was born after two undergraduates at the @entity9 university , @entity8 , noticed their friends frantically deleting incriminating or unsuitable photos from their @entity12 accounts just before going on a job interview or on a date			1
their app allows users to take a photo and send it to friends , but the recipient can only look at the photo for a few seconds before it self - destructs - leaving no digital trace			1
he needs @entity0 ! @entity9 congressman @entity22 sent lewd pictures of himself to a 21 - year - old student via @entity25			1
unfortunately , he also managed to tweet them to everyone else too			0
the app could also come to the rescue of the many celebs caught out by the sexting trend , which has seen the likes of @entity33 and @entity35 congressman , @entity22 , reveal much more than expected to the public			2
other celebrities who probably wish they had @entity0 include @entity39 actress @entity38 , whose topless photos were splashed across the internet when her email inbox was hacked , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45			2
even prince @entity46 was left red - faced , after a fellow party - goer snapped him in the nude during a game of strip billiards earlier this year			2
but if you 're hoping @entity0 is the answer to all of your pictorial woes , be warned : there 's a glitch			0
unscientific testing conducted by the @entity57 revealed that fast - fingered @entity1 users can save a screen grab of the image before it self - destructs , so long as they 're within the time limit set by the sender			1
perhaps it might be better to think twice before sending that risque text after all ...			2
leaked : twilight actress @entity38 ( left ) was embarrassed when topless photos were leaked onto the internet , while singer @entity33 ( right ) has been known to tweet revealing pictures to her ex , @entity69 mystery : pictures of a topless woman believed to be @entity73 ( left ) were released online , although the actress has neither confirmed or denied the rumours			0
like @entity38 , @entity43 's ( right ) email account was hacked and topless pictures were leaked onto the net			0
caught out : actress @entity45 ( left ) posed nude for ex-boyfriend @entity79 but the pictures later made it onto the internet			0
prince @entity46 ( right ) was snapped by a fellow partygoer during a game of strip billiards earlier this year in @entity86			0
the embarrassingly candid shots later made it onto the web .			0

new app deletes photos *30* seconds after you send them ...
but quick - fingered @entity1 users could still manage to hang on to them
