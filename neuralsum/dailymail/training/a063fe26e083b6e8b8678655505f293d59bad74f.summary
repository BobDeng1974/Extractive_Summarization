success : the way to a woman 's heart is simple - wear a t - shirt forget expensive designer clothes , a simple t - shirt could be the best way to capture a woman ’s heart			1
wearing a plain white short - sleeved top with a large black letter @entity12 printed on the front can make a man up to 12 per cent more attractive , scientists claim			1
researchers suggest it creates an illusion that broadens the shoulders and slims the waist , producing a more v - shaped body – a sign of masculinity			1
the best results were observed in participants who were most out of shape , with already toned individuals only gaining a slight increase in perceived attractiveness			0
in contrast , all those wearing a top with an inverted ‘ t ’ - with the bar running around their waist - were deemed up to 12 per cent less attractive			1
it suggests shifting the focus to a man ’s gut reduces his desirability			0
the team said a waist - to - chest ratio ( @entity43 ) of between 0.7 and 0.8 - where the shoulders are around 20 per cent broader than the hips - was seen as the ideal			2
@entity48 psychologist dr @entity47 said : ‘ the wider barred ‘ t ’ seems to emphasise the upper chest when upright , which accentuates men ’s ‘ optimum ’ shape			2
the opposite happens when inverted			0
‘ @entity43 is one of just a number of body measures that humans use to judge attractiveness and health			2
' our ability to detect , process and use this information appears to be implicit			0
' the brain and sensory mechanism underpinning this are probably evolved and are almost certainly managing what we look for and how we respond			0
improving chances : women who were shown images of men wearing the white t - shirt with a large black @entity53 were 12 per cent more likely to be attracted to them ‘ the effect was most notable for normal men with a waist as wide as their shoulders			1
whereas with those who are already in good shape , the @entity12 was simply amplifying the body shape they already had , so the benefit was less marked			1
’ the study involved showing 30 female undergraduates , aged 18 to 25 , images of five different male body shapes and asked them to mark their perceived attractiveness and health			2
each male model wore a plain white t - shirt with no @entity53 , and with an upright and inverted t - illusions of varying shapes and sizes			1
the results showed that upright t - illusions increased attractiveness and health perceptions			0
dr @entity47 said the horizontal bar on the t - shirt had to be as equal or longer than the vertical bar for optimum effectiveness			1
he said : ‘ clearly there are individual tastes and preferences , but we can see here how fashion could have an implicit positive or negative effect on perceived attractiveness and health			0
‘ it suggests that you can use this kind of optical illusion that artists and fashion designers use all the time to tap into our basic sensory psychology			0
