by @entity1 reporter published : 09:35 est , 2 october 2013 updated : 11:05 est , 2 october 2013 an estimated 10,000 walruses unable to find sea ice over shallow @entity5 water have come ashore on @entity7 's northwest coast			1
scientists with the @entity9 on friday photographed walruses packed onto a beach on a barrier island near @entity13 , an @entity14 village 300 miles southwest of @entity15 and 700 miles northwest of @entity16			1
the walruses have been coming to shore since mid-september			0
the large herd was spotted during @entity9 's annual arctic marine mammal aerial survey , an effort conducted with the @entity23 , the agency that conducts offshore lease sales			0
refuge : thousands of walruses pack onto a remote @entity7 island after being unable to locate any @entity5 sea ice an estimated 2,000 to 4,000 walruses were photographed at the site sept. 12			1
the @entity31 , the agency that manages walruses , immediately took steps to prevent a stampede among the animals packed shoulder to shoulder on the rocky coastline			0
the agency works with villages to keep people and airplanes a safe distance from herds			0
young animals are especially vulnerable to stampedes triggered by a polar bear , a human hunter or a low - flying airplane			1
the carcasses of more than 130 mostly young walruses were counted after a stampede in september 2009 at @entity7 's @entity53			0
the gathering of walruses on shore is a phenomenon that has accompanied the loss of summer sea ice as the climate has warmed			1

females give birth on sea ice and use ice as a diving platform to reach snails , clams and worms on the shallow continental shelf			2
as temperatures warm in summer , the edge of the sea ice recedes north			1
females and their young ride the edge of the sea ice into the @entity86			1
however , in recent years , sea ice has receded north beyond continental shelf waters and into @entity5 water 10,000 feet deep or more where walrus can not dive to the bottom			1
walrus in large numbers were first spotted on the @entity96 side of the @entity86 in 2007			0
they returned in 2009 , and in 2011 , scientists estimated 30,000 walruses along one kilometer of beach near @entity13			0

the goal of the marine mammals survey is to record the abundance of bowhead , gray , minke , fin and beluga whales plus other marine mammals in areas of potential oil and natural gas development , said @entity130 marine mammal scientist @entity129 in an announcement			0
' in addition to photographing the walrus haulout area , @entity9 scientists documented more bowhead whales , including calves and feeding adults in the @entity138 this summer compared to 2012 , " said @entity129			0
" we are also seeing more gray whale calves in the @entity86 than we have in recent years			2
' environmental groups say the loss of sea ice due to climate warming is harming marine mammals and oil and gas development would add to their stress .			2

the @entity103 have been coming ashore on an island 700 miles northwest of @entity16 since mid-september
in recent years the sea ice has receded north to deeper water where walrus can not dive to the bottom
