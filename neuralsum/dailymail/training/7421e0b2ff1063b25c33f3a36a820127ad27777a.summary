by @entity0 published : 05:26 est , 3 january 2013 updated : 14:14 est , 3 january 2013 a girl left severely disabled at birth is being forced to fly to the other side of the world every month in a ' soul destroying ' journey to qualify for medical compensation			0
@entity8 was born in @entity9 14 years ago but suffered horrific brain damage when she was starved of oxygen			1
the authorities ruled that mistakes made by a midwife were to blame and @entity8 was handed a massive payout package to provide care for the rest of her life			1
@entity8 , pictured right with her mother @entity19 , has to fly to the other side of the world to qualify for her medical compensation when her @entity24 mother @entity19 decided to return home to live in the @entity26 in june 2010 the compensation money was halted			1
but mrs @entity8 found a loophole in the legislation which means so long as @entity8 is present in @entity9 for just 24 hours once a month she still qualifies for the Â£ 1,000 - per week compensation			1
payments started in jan 2011 as soon as they landed @entity8 has now endured 11 round - the - world trips of 23,000 miles from her home in @entity33 , @entity34 - the equivalent of flying further than the moon which is 238,855 miles away			1
amazingly , when the teenager , her mother and her mother 's partner land - they are automatically registered as having been in the country - meaning they often return after just one night 's stay at an airport hotel			0
sadly nearly all of the money , which should be for wheelchair bound @entity8 's medical care , is instead spent on air fares and travel costs			1
@entity19 , 43 , and her husband , @entity53 , 47 , have to accompany the teenager on the exhausting trips which often involve a journey time of up to 40 hours to get out there			2
@entity8 , now 14 , with her mother @entity58 ( left ) when she was born and ( right ) @entity59 when she was three @entity8 pictured after having undergone surgery for an @entity62 infection when she was five but mrs @entity8 is determined to continue with the journeys in a bid to highlight @entity8 's plight and force the authorities in @entity9 to back down and just make the compensation payments without the gruelling condition attached			1
she said : ' @entity8 did not ask for this life and all this is about is giving her the care she so desperately needs			1
' it 's not so that we can be wealthy - we are not living a life of luxury from this money - it 's about providing round - the - clock care for her			2
' @entity8 's conditions mean she is wheelchair - bound and she is only able to speak a handful of words			2
mrs @entity8 - a former shop manager - is now @entity59 's full - time carer			2
she added : ' i do n't know how long we are going to be able to carry on doing the trips - they are soul destroying			0
i am in tears every time we get onto the plane			0
@entity8 has now endured 11 round - the - world trips of 23,000 miles from her home in @entity33 , @entity34 ' we have to have @entity8 lying across our laps because she is not able to sit upright			2
' i was ready to quit after the first few journeys we made but @entity8 's brothers and sisters encouraged me to carry on , reminding me that we are doing this for her future , hopefully so she will still be provided for in years to come when we are no longer alive			2
' financial support is restricted for people once they leave @entity9 , meaning the only way that @entity8 can get her full entitlement is by moving back out there			1
mrs @entity8 , a mother of six , said : ' it is heart - wrenching for us			1
@entity8 needs 24/7 care and it is very difficult			1
' we really do want to get the best care we can for her and improve the quality of her life but they are making it extremely difficult			0
' why should we have to be living in @entity9 in order to get the money she is entitled to ? all of our support network is now here in @entity24 and moving back to @entity9 is simply not an option			1
' @entity8 was born at home in @entity9 but suffered perinatal hypoxia - meaning her brain was starved of oxygen at the critical time			1
the teenager , who can barely speak , also suffers from cerebral palsy and has a twisted spine			0
mrs @entity8 hopes one day to be able to take her daughter to @entity127 for an operation to straighten it and relieve the pain she constantly suffers			0
the mother - of - six says she has been constantly having to battle the authorities in order to get the compensation @entity8 is due			2
she added : ' she is a fighter , so i am going to keep fighting for her			0
we were told she would never speak , but she recently started to say a few words			0
' when she said ' mummy , i love you ' it was one of the happiest moments in my whole life			0
' mrs @entity8 has five other children - @entity144 , 21 , @entity145 , 19 , @entity146 , 16 , @entity147 , 11 and @entity148 , seven			0
@entity144 takes responsibility for looking after her younger siblings when her mother and husband , a carpenter , head to @entity9			2
the compensation money - to provide ' attendant care ' stopped in july 2011 and mrs @entity8 's @entity9 lawyer argued there was ' no logical reason ' why @entity8 should not receive the same payment in the @entity26 but the case was dismissed			1
a spokesman for @entity9 's @entity161 said he was unable to comment on individual cases			0
he said : ' we provide a range of support for people with accident - related injuries			0
however , the @entity168 restricts the support to clients once they leave @entity9			0
' there is discretion for the @entity161 to fund people living overseas , but factors such as cost and whether the care can be monitored are taken into account .			0

@entity8 was starved of oxygen at birth in @entity9
she was given massive payout package to provide care for rest of her life
but when her family moved to @entity24 with her the payments stopped
that was until her mother @entity19 found a loophole in the *system*
