the 47 - year - old revealed he was tied down for hours at a time while a feeding tube was inserted into his nose so the liquid nutrient drink ensure could be digested , causing his nose to bleed			1
but the father of ten was adamant that nothing would deter him from his four - year hunger strike			2
' during each force - feeding , my nose bleeds , ' @entity2 said in a sworn statement submitted to the court by his lawyer , @entity22 , a law professor at @entity23			1
' the pain from each force - feeding is so excruciating that i am unable to sleep at night because of the pain in my throat			0
' the former sheep merchant who was never charged with any crime during seven years at ' @entity3 ' , stopped eating in june 2005 , and kept up his protest until he was sent home to @entity6 in 2009			2
@entity2 alleges he was roughly forced into the restraint chair - what he called ' the torture chair ' - and left there much longer than the two - hour maximum , even though he was n't always confrontational			1
the military acknowledges a ' forced cell extraction team ' was repeatedly used to move @entity2 when he refused to walk on his own to where striking detainees were fed. @entity2 says his nasal passages and back are permanently damaged from the way he was strapped down and fed through a nasogastric tube			1
court papers show that @entity2 once racked up 80 disciplinary infractions in four months , refusing to be force - fed among them , and that he and fellow prisoners smeared themselves with their own feces for five days to keep guards at bay and protest rough treatment			1
the one - time merchant said he has no work now , with his stomach and back in constant pain from the effects of his strike			2
' my family did not know what i was going through at @entity3 - the humiliation , the torture , the solitary confinement , ' he told @entity65 ' not once did the thought occur to me to stop my hunger strike			2
' i think about the men who are at @entity3 and i wonder about @entity70 's humanity			2
' i ask myself how much longer this will go on			0
' former @entity3 inmate @entity2 , pictured in @entity6 , was never charged with any crime during seven year detention this is the restraint chair used to force - feed @entity3 inmates the news comes amid a raft of protests against the @entity70 military facility in @entity83 and its controversial force - feeding processes , with about 44 detainees being fed through their nose every day to prevent them from starving to death			1
@entity65 reports 104 of the 166 prisoners are hunger striking , and it 's @entity70 police to keep strikers alive			1
navy capt. @entity92 , a spokesman for the detention center , said the feeding procedure is considered safe and its use has been upheld by the courts			0
he said the feeding tubes are lubricated and prisoners are offered anesthetics to prevent long - lasting damage			0
' we think there are adequate safeguards in place to make it as pain - free and comfortable as possible , ' he said			0
' it 's not done to inflict pain and it 's not done as punishment			0
it 's done to preserve life			0
' officials refer to the process by the medical term ' enteral feeding ' rather than ' force feeding '			0
it involves restraining men with straps that resemble airplane seatbelts to a specially designed chair that looks like a piece of exercise equipment			0
more than 40 @entity3 detainees are force - fed each day human rights groups , seen here protesting outside the @entity124 on friday , have criticized president @entity125 for failing to close @entity3 but dr. @entity126 , an internist on the faculty of the @entity128 , said force - feeding hunger strikers is unethical			1
he said there are risks to prolonged enteral feeding , including the possibility of getting liquid in the lungs and or damaging the nasal passages , particularly when the person is uncooperative			1
' you do a procedure when it 's the best choice under the circumstances , ' @entity126 said			0
' in this ethical context , these are people you are forcing to receive sustenance they do n't want			0
' i do n't know how you begin to measure risk - benefit trade - offs , but there are some medical risks , certainly			0
' the military began using the restraint chair at @entity3 to feed prisoners in january 2006 after hunger strikers grew dangerously thin and officials feared some might die .			1

*ex-guantanamo* @entity154 inmate @entity2 , 47 , has revealed four years of being forcibly fed through the nose while strapped to a ' torture chair ' has permanently damaged his back and nasal passages .
