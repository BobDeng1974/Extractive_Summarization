plans : a development being built in @entity2 , @entity3 , part - funded by @entity4 and @entity6 city council , will feature toilets that do not use the words ' men ' or ' ladies ' but have symbols denoting that they can be used by anybody a council is planning to replace traditional male and female lavatories with ' gender neutral ' toilets in an attempt to facilitate the transgender community			1
the facilities will avoid using the words ' men ' and ' ladies ' , instead using symbols that indicate they can be used by people of any sex			0
but the plans to change signage on the toilets , which will be used by both adults and children , have attracted criticism and been described as ' political correctness '			2
@entity4 and @entity6 city council chiefs said that they wished to ' promote the term gender neutral ' in emails discussing the proposed block on @entity36 , @entity3			1
the Â£ 140,000 development , which will include a cafe and four lavatories , is being joint - funded by a @entity40 and the city council			1
conservative councillor @entity42 expressed her dissatisfaction at the development , with construction set to commence this week , describing the plans as ' unnecessary bureaucracy '			2
she told the @entity49 : ' local residents , particularly women with children , would much prefer to use separate facilities as apart from anything else , it is safer			0
' if the male / female symbols , rather than any text , are to be used on the toilet then this avoids any confusion , so why is the council muddying the waters by insisting they are called gender neutral , which will mean nothing to most people ? ' the councillor from the @entity2 ward claimed that the city council were planning to gradually phase out single - sex lavatories			1
promote : @entity4 and @entity6 city council chiefs said that they wished to ' promote the term gender neutral ' in emails discussing the proposed @entity4 has a gay , lesbian and transgender population of approximately 40,000			1
the development , due to take 12 weeks to complete , follows the creation of a city council working group ' into making it fairer for trans people to live , work and socialise in @entity4 and @entity6 '			1
mrs @entity42 added : ' the parish council , which is part funding this toilet , actually wanted to have separate male and female toilets , which would also have been my preference and , i suspect , the preference of most local residents			0
' however , the city council in their wisdom , decided otherwise			0
' parish councillor @entity91 said a sign will shortly be placed on the fencing around the site describing the toilets as ' gender neutral '			0
an image of a male , female and child will also be fitted to the doors when complete			0
a city council spokesman said : ' when producing signs for public toilets in the city we use standard images rather than words			2
this is particularly beneficial to the many tourists from overseas visiting our city			0

a new development will include toilets that can be used by any adult or child
@entity4 and @entity6 city council want to ' promote term gender neutral '
*opponents* described change in signage as ' unnecessary bureaucracy '
toilets will not feature the words ' men ' and ' ladies ' but *universal* symbols
