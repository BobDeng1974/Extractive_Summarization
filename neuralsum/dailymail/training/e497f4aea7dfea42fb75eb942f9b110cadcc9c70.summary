hundreds of dolphins are seen diving through the sparkling waters as they migrate along the @entity3 of @entity4			2
on the last leg of their annual 6,000mile migration , the dolphins can be seen joyfully breaking the surface , and jumping across the waves off the coast of @entity12			2
the migration saw the dolphins move from @entity15 on the south coast of @entity4 along the @entity17 up though @entity18 to @entity12 on the east coast			1
long journey home : thousands of migrating dolphins reach @entity12 on their trip along the @entity3 of @entity4 moving on : coastal dolphins , such as these , are known to stay closer to the coastline and therefore do not travel as far as off shore dolphins , who prefer to live further out moving down the line : the large pod 's migration has taken them from @entity15 on the south coast of @entity4 , along the @entity17 , up though @entity18 to @entity12 on the east coast photographer couple @entity36 and @entity38 followed the dolphins for seven months – from february to august - before they found the perfect conditions in @entity12 , having spent a total of 440 hours and travelled 6,060miles on sea			1
@entity36 said : ‘ it suddenly all came into place			0
‘ we found the common dolphins close to the river and followed them out at sea for about 30 km , the light was perfect and the dolphins played along			0
‘ i love seeing them ' bow riding ' , breaching next to the boat , just for fun , and hunting fish			0
‘ here and there we can spot a humpback whale - these animals live a life of paradise			0
’ jump for joy : the dolphins migrate with the seasons and often travel in pods of up to 30 individuals catching a ride : the dolphins are not the only animals moving along the @entity4 coastline , birds also follow in their wake dedication : photographers @entity36 and @entity38 followed the dolphins for seven months - from february until august - before shooting the spectacular images absolute prefection : in order to find the perfect conditions to shoot the dolphins the @entity82 spent a total of 440 hours and travelled more than 6,000 miles on sea onwards and upwards : some of the dolphins breaks the surface inn a jump in the afternoon sun off the coast of the @entity3 near @entity92 a skip and a hop : although the dolphins have been travelling a long way - 6,060miles - along the @entity4 coast , there is still time for fun and play all for one : the pods protect each other against predators , but also keep families together , hunt together and communicate			1
