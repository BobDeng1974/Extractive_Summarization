' @entity16 , a dancer since she was four years old , was living in @entity73 , @entity74 pursuing a career as a professional dancer when she learned of her father 's diagnosis			1
@entity16 said the experience forced her to revisit her past and also reevaluate her role in her family @entity16 said she has been working on the project for more than a year and said in the end , she was able to accept the struggle , and found love and acceptance in the home with her family after her move to @entity14 , the project , which she has been working on for more than a year , unfolded while she was working on a photo series for a graduate studies class at @entity94			1
while home one day , she walked past her dad , who was fast asleep on the couch in the living room after a long day of dialysis treatment			2

' it was symbolic to how i have felt being back in the space and how we mentally exist in different worlds , ' she said of that moment			0
' this was the first image in the series that actually took me some time to understand			0
the images were captured throughout the house as she is seen performing a different move in each frame as she explores her place in the family structure using lights , a tripod and a timer , @entity16 said each process of creating the images is different as she moves around the spaces in the home to capture the spontaneous moments while she is waltzing around the home , her family members are seen maintaining their daily lives			2
she said because they are used to her dancing around the house it does not seem like anything unusual to them ' from there i continued to create these images that demonstrated how i felt unseen and trapped within my own home			0
' the images were captured throughout the house including the living room , at her family 's kitchen table , in a bathroom and in bedrooms as she explores her place in the family structure and also the tensions of returning to her childhood home as an adult			1
while she is seen performing a different move in each image , her family performs their daily routines while the timer flickers capturing the spontaneous moments			0
