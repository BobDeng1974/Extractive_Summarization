by @entity1 reporter published : 12:37 est , 13 september 2013 updated : 12:47 est , 13 september 2013 tragic : @entity2 , 17 , was killed after he was catapulted from his trail bike by a wire a nursery firm gamekeeper had tied to two trees as a makeshift fence in @entity8 a nursery firm has been ordered to pay out £ 50,000 over the death of a teenager who was thrown off his motorbike when he rode it into a makeshift wire fence			1
@entity2 , 17 , suffered severe head injuries when he was catapulted off his 110cc off - road bike after hitting a line tied between two trees on land close to @entity19 , @entity20 in 2008			1
he was found unconscious by his father @entity21 lying near his bike and airlifted to @entity23 , but later died from his injuries			2
bosses at nursery firm @entity26 have now pleaded guilty to causing his death at @entity28			1
the court heard that the company 's gamekeeper @entity30 erected the wire along with a sign in a bid to deter trespassers from entering private land			1
the sign , however , was taken down by an unknown person , and replaced with a ' grubby white t - shirt '			2
as @entity2 rode along the track he failed to spot the marker and hit the wire , which had been tied at around chest height			1
@entity44 , @entity45 said : ' the cable should have been removed while there was no sign present and @entity30 should have done more to alert people to the potential danger			0
' such failures by the company gave rise to the potential of danger , a danger that ultimately claimed the life of @entity2			1
' the cable and shirt combination presented a foreseeable risk of serious injury and should have been dealt with accordingly			0
' judge @entity61 added : ' unfortunately , the metal sign was at some point removed by some unknown and unauthorised person			0
' when the loss was discovered by mr @entity30 ’s stepbrother , he replaced it by the crude expedient of attaching what has been accurately described as a “ grubby white t - shirt ” to the middle of the cable			0
' the cable in its altered state was inconspicuous , particularly as it was shaded by trees on either side of the track			0
' despite the fact that @entity2 was probably driving at less than 20 mph , he would have had little time to react to its presence by the time he saw it			1
' to those who loved @entity2 , no sentence will seem remotely adequate , and they are right to think so			1
his life was priceless and could never be measured in monetary terms			0
' speaking after the verdict , @entity2 's devastated father @entity21 slammed the ' hollow apology ' his family had received from the company during the judgment			1
guilty : @entity92 pleaded guilty in @entity28 and were ordered to pay a £ 50,000 fine over the death of teenager @entity2 he said : ' it ’s nice to get some sort of justice			1
today was the only time we have received an apology in five years - it was a bit of a hollow apology			2
' i want to thank the @entity105 ( executive ) , they were the only ones that have stuck by us throughout all of this and we ’re pleased with today ’s outcome			0
' losing a child for anyone is devastating and we hope the judge ’s actions will deter anyone who is thinking of doing something similar and to stop any other family having to go through what we ’ve gone through			0
he was a typical 17 year - old getting ready for his adult life			2
he was a happy - go - lucky lad who always had a smile on his face			0
' the wheels of justice turn very slowly			0
it ’s taken five years but that ’ll never change what ’s happened so today ’s the end of a chapter for us			0
' no amount of fine would have made us feel better but all i hope that people who are thinking of doing something irresponsible like this will think about the suffering it could cause			0
' police at scene of @entity2 's death on the country path in @entity20 in 2008			1
@entity26 now have four years to pay the fine , which amounts to over £ 100,000 including legal costs			2
@entity105 inspector @entity143 , who helped the @entity2 family bring the case to trial , said : ' @entity2 ’s tragic death at such a young age could have been avoided if @entity92 had thought more the potential consequences of erecting the cable			1
' it was strung between two trees in a dark , wooded area part of the way down the track , which made it difficult to see for anyone travelling towards it			0
' sadly , @entity2 was thrown from his bike when he collided with the cable and suffered fatal head injuries as a result			1
' if the company wanted to stop people from using the track then it should have installed a proper barrier or warning sign at the entrance			2
that way , it could have kept vehicles away without putting lives in danger			0
