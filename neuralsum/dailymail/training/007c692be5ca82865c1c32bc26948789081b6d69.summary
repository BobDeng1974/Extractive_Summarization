by @entity0 follow @ @ charliefscott @entity2 's prolific pre-season continued as @entity3 swatted @entity4 aside on monday evening , recording a comfortable 2 - 0 win with goals coming either side of the break			1
@entity2 , a one - time @entity10 international , put the visitors ahead at @entity12 with a deflected effort from distance , and @entity15 , son of @entity3 boss @entity16 , increased their lead with a stonking strike into the top corner from 30 yards in the second half			1
@entity3 have now won four and drawn one during their run of pre-season games , as they prepare to play in the @entity24 for the first time in a decade			1
the difference : @entity3 goalscorer @entity2 , right , hassles @entity27 in possession during the match @entity2 was at the heart of everything good about @entity3 's play at @entity12			1
the former @entity34 striker netted the opening goal of the game , provided the assist for @entity15 's stunning second - half effort , and was handful for @entity4 ' defence throughout			1
as early as the fifth minute @entity2 was causing problems , dropping deep before threading a pass out to @entity43 , whose cross then found @entity45 on the left			0
only a decent stop from @entity48 kept the score level			0
@entity4 : @entity48 ; @entity50 ( @entity51 74 ) , @entity52 ( @entity53 74 ) , @entity54 ( @entity55 84 ) , @entity56 ( @entity57 84 ) ; @entity58 ( @entity59 69 ) , @entity60 ( @entity61 69 ) ; @entity62 , @entity63 ( @entity64 46 ) , @entity65 ( @entity66 53 ) ; @entity67 ( @entity68 69 )			0

subs not used : @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89			0
goals : @entity2 23 , @entity15 67			2
not long after @entity3 thought they were ahead when @entity84 bundled home from close - range after @entity2 had flicked an enticing cross from @entity82 into his path			2
despite the @entity98 striker 's appeals the goal was chalked off , with @entity84 adjudged to have fouled goalkeeper @entity48 in the build - up			2
midway through the first half @entity15 's side were deservedly in front			1
@entity2 , with his back to goal , swiveled on to his left and let fly from 30 yards , the ball bouncing into the back of the net courtesy of a generous deflection			0
@entity3 continued to pepper the goal of their former player @entity48 , and the @entity4 ' goalkeeper had to be alert to keep out efforts from @entity84 and @entity43 in quick succession			1
the hosts began to force the issue as the half progressed			0
their exciting academy product @entity27 fired an effort against the post in the 43rd minute , and seconds later put @entity121 loanee @entity120 through on goal , but @entity75 saved well			2
dons completed the loan signing of @entity67 earlier on monday , and there were encouraging signs for the club 's fans as he and @entity129 struck up an immediate understanding going forward			0
the home side started the second half stronger , with @entity67 's pace pinning @entity3 's defence back			1
good impression : @entity120 , right , played well on his @entity4 debut after joining from @entity121 on loan in the 58th minute @entity67 wasted their best chance of the game , when his touch let him down inside the area following a decent cross from @entity62			0
only a goal - line clearance from @entity81 stopped @entity67 levelling the scores shortly after the hour mark , the @entity3 midfielder hoofing the ball away from danger after the 21 - year - old forward had shot at goal following a @entity62 corner			2
despite @entity4 ' dominance after the break it was @entity3 that grabbed the second goal of the game - and what a goal it was			1
that man @entity2 's cross from the left was cleared only as far as @entity15			2
the right - back needed just a single touch to set himself , before hammering a shot into the top corner from 30 yards that prompted applause from both sets of supporters			0
five minutes later he departed to a standing ovation from the @entity173 fans			0
dons introduced a couple of trialists late on , with @entity61 firing just over and then clearing off his own line within the space of a minute			0
@entity179 and @entity180 are next up for the @entity173 , before they start their @entity24 campaign against @entity183 on august 16 .			1

former @entity10 international scored midway through the first half , his fourth goal in pre-season for the foxes
