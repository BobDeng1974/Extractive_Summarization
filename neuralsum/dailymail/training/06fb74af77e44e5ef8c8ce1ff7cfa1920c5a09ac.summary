facing the possibility of more than 45 years in jail , @entity9 pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder and was sentenced as an adult to 25 years			1

' i ’m very positive and confident that my son will be tried as a juvenile , ' @entity9 said , ' and that he will be out a lot sooner than he was supposed to be			1
' @entity9 was one of three juveniles from a small town in northeastern @entity11 charged with killing 49 - year - old @entity57 as part of a plot to run away to @entity60 in april 2010			0
