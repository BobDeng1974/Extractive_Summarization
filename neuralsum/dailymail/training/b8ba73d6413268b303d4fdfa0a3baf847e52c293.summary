by @entity0 @entity1 : 08:39 est , 16 december 2013 @entity2 : 11:31 est , 16 december 2013 an engineer has created what he believes is a solution to the @entity9 ’s looming housing crisis - a three - storey flat pack home			0
dr @entity10 has created the @entity12 ‘ cube house ’ , which is 10ft ( 3m ) tall and 13ft ( 4m ) wide and can sleep up to two people			1
he says the house is as easy to build as ' an @entity16 bookcase ' and takes just four hours to erect			1
the bedroom contains a full - sized double bed			0
there is also a 4m - long galley bathroom - complete with a full - sized shower , sink and toilet which uses a composting toilet			2
a fully functional kitchen with hob , fridge freezer , combination microwave oven			2
a dining table which can be stowed to make room for a four - seater sofa			0
a two - seater sofa and two ottomans that can be reconfigured for 4 - person dining / sitting or two - person lounging			0
low - energy lighting and appliances ( including a tv and washing machine ) mechanical heat - recovery ventilation			0
very efficient heating and hot water using an optional air - source heat pump			0
solar panels on the roof providing power to led lighting			0
despite the cube ’s compact dimensions it crams in a lounge , spiral staircase , kitchen , full - size bathroom and bedroom which are spread over three floors			1
it achieves this through ingenious internal design , such as a bookcase that doubles as a mini spiral staircase			2
the @entity12 will go on the market early next year and range between £ 10,500 to £ 45,000			1
it does not require planning permission because it is under 13ft ( 4m ) in height			1
dr @entity10 said : ' the @entity12 is practical and fits together easily			1
if someone can put up an @entity16 bookcase then they can put this up			0
' it goes together like flat - pack furniture , although when a customer buys it they will get the finished product and wo n’t have to put it together themselves			0
' it takes around four hours to put the cube together , however it would obviously take longer when you add i ’m the furniture , it depends how quickly you work			1
' most of the furniture inside is from @entity18 , which i guess does coincidentally link in with how easy the @entity12 is to put together			1
' inside the @entity12 there is a lot of practicability , with things such as the dining table being able to move while still attached to the wall , giving more room to move around and also lounge on the sofa			1
' the @entity12 has everything a normal home has , except it is all scaled down , however , there is still enough room for people , with a double bed as an available feature			1
' the house is as easy to build as ' an @entity16 bookcase '			1
it features a scaled - down , fully - functioning bathroom he added : ' it is quick to put up too , we can build the shell in under four hours , although obviously it would take us longer to add everything in , including the kitchen			1
' i think it is great , of course i would say that , but i really do think it is and it is the only one in the world			0
' the building starts at £ 9,495 to build yourself or £ 10,305.00 for @entity125 to erect it for youthe basic option includes foundations , floor joists , ceiling joists and wall studs			2
the second option costs between £ 22,839 and £ 27,208 and adds insulation to walls , floor and ceiling , roof covering and internal birch lining to walls			2
cosy : the @entity12 costs between £ 10,000 and £ 45,000			1
the dining table ( pictured ) can be stowed to make room for a four - seater sofa cutting red tape : the structure does not require planning permission because it is under 4m in height the deluxe package costs up to £ 47,200 and includes a shower , furniture , led tv , kitchen appliances , bed and mattress , lights , switches , wiring , plumbing , triple - glazed windows , chesnut cladding , cork tile flooring , and is fully painted throughout			1
the @entity12 made its tv debut on @entity165 ’s @entity164 on @entity166 last week			2
because of the small dimensions , the structure has the same planning status of a static caravan			0
dr @entity10 , who teaches at the @entity172 , decided to make the cube in order to teach people how they could help the environment			2
lead by example : dr @entity10 decided to make the cube in order to teach people how they could help the environment he said : ' i used to be an engineer and i was looking to encourage people to be greener and make pro-environmental changes			2
' i thought instead of telling people , i could show them			0
' for example , if someone tells you that an led light is better and explains why , you ’ll probably go home and not do anything about it			0
' however , when people would say " how is it better , and show me how " , i could , all i had to do was flick a switch , it started as a way of encouraging people they could do what i have done			0
' because of the small dimensions , the structure has the same planning status of a static caravan bedtime : the rooms are spread out over three floors and the sleeping quarters ( pictured ) contain a double bed			0

@entity12 ' cube house ' costs between £ 10,500 and £ 47,000
it takes just four hours to build and sleeps two people *comfortably*
kitchen , staircase , lounge and bathroom all contained within
it does not require planning permission as it is just 10ft tall
