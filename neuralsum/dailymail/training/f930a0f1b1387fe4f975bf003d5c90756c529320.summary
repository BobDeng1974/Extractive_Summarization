by @entity0 when animal - loving zookeeper @entity2 , 31 , from @entity3 , proposed to his long term love @entity5 , 26 , he had already decided that only a wildlife themed wedding would do			1
much to his surprise , his paramedic bride - to - be agreed - and even allowed him to take complete control over planning for their nuptials			2
but with £ 1,800 spent on life - size plastic animals for the reception and just £ 96 on the dress , the results were n't quite what she bargained for			1
big day : @entity2 and @entity19 's big day involved plastic zoo animals and a pair of very real pygmy crocodiles happy couple : @entity2 decided to make @entity19 's bouquet a tropical one ' all i could think was how can he be given so much money and yet not pay out for a proper wedding dress ! ' she laughs			1
the couple married this summer in a wildlife - themed wedding , complete with sharp - toothed special guests in the shape of a pair of pygmy crocodiles			1
but @entity19 , who will appear with @entity2 on @entity35 , says dress notwithstanding , she would be happy to let her new husband do it all over again			1
' i was happy for @entity2 to make the decisions because it was a once in a lifetime opportunity and we would never have been able to afford such a wedding if we had n't have been on the show , ' she confesses			1
' obviously , i trust him			0
he always does great little surprises for me so i thought he would do a good job , although i did n't trust him with the dress			0
' he does n't always have the best taste in clothes though , but i hoped he would get some inspiration from somewhere and choose well			0
' unfortunately for @entity19 , @entity2 's inspiration came from @entity53 instead			2
' on @entity53 , i had 14,000 dresses to choose from , ' he protests			0
' i had more choice than any dress shop could have ever offered so it was exactly what i wanted			0
' he adds : ' i would totally recommend an @entity53 wedding dress			0
' @entity2 , who describes his ideal wedding as ' crazy , memorable and nothing normal - just like my whole life so far ' , says he loved the experience of planning his big day and says more grooms should get involved			1
precarious : @entity64 is used to handling sharp - toothed wildlife , but it 's all new to paramedic @entity19 perfect venue : the couple married within @entity71 's @entity70 - a series of domed biospheres ' i guess i should say do n't do it , ' he says , ' but looking back , it was a once in a life time experience and it you can take the pressure then just go for it and do it large			1
' he also reveals that he was the one who first came up with the idea of getting married on television and says that too was ' very me '			0
' i knew @entity19 would love what i planned as long as it came from the heart and she she did , ' he adds			0
' i 'm good at planning things , although it is n't so easy with a film crew breathing down your neck. , ' for her part , and in spite of the @entity53 dress , @entity19 says she had a wonderful day that ended just as she had imagined it - married to the man she loves			1
' the best part of the wedding was seeing @entity2 and knowing we were there to take the biggest step of out lives together , ' she says			2
' and seeing all our family and friends gathered together was wonderful			0
' smart choice : @entity19 looked lovely in her @entity53 dress and @entity2 says he would recommend it to anyone what 's more , despite not getting the church ceremony she had hoped for and having to share centre stage with a squad of plastic animals , she says she does think grooms should get more involved in wedding planning			1
' the big day was really important to me as i wanted it to be a big coming together of all our friends and family , ' she says			1
' i wanted it to be somewhere traditional that was really picturesque and hoped for a church ceremony although i knew @entity2 would never go for that			2
' she adds : ' i definitely think it proves that brides should give more thought to their fiance 's thoughts when planning a wedding , even if something does n't sound like a great idea			0
' @entity2 himself says he would n't change a thing			2
' i did everything i could to make the wedding perfect and very us , even though some of it might seem crazy , ' he says			0
' it was memorable and personal - just the way i imagined it			0
' @entity19 and @entity2 appear on @entity152 , tonight at 9pm on @entity35			2
