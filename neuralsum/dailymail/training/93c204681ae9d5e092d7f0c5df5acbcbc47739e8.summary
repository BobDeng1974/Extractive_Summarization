a hiker who was stranded in the @entity2 wilderness for nearly three months after a bear destroyed his supplies was forced to eat his beloved dog			1
@entity6 escaped with his life when his @entity8 chased away the wild animal that attacked their camp - destroying their canoe and food supplies - just days into a planned three - month climbing trip			1
but three days later , in a real - life display of survival - of - the - fittest , the 44 - year - old killed his heroic @entity8 with a rock and ate it in a desperate bid to survive			1
with no way to call for help , the stranded explorer then spent a further three months alone and starving before a search party came to the rescue			2
desperate measures : experienced hiker @entity6 is said to have eaten his pet dog to survive incredibly , survival experts have praised mr @entity6 's actions as a good use of ' reason ' , which may have saved his life			1
by the time mr @entity6 was airlifted out of the @entity34 wilderness , about 800km from @entity35 , he had lost half his body weight , was suffering from hypothermia and was unable to speak			2
however , @entity38 , claims it is unlikely he would have been alive at all without sacrificing his dearest companion			2
' he survived because he made â€¹ good decisions			0
eating his dog was one of them , ' mr @entity38 said			0
' you have to be desperate , but there 's no shame in [ eating the dog ]			0
he had to use reason			0
' another expert , @entity50 , a survival instructor , said the act was a natural instinct of the human body provoked by extreme hunger : ' when you start to go hungry , you get mood swings , your mind breaks , and you cramp up all over your body			0
eventually , your body will start cannibalizing itself			0
' found : @entity59 lake , where @entity6 was discovered after his solo trip turned into a disaster he added : ' up there , in the @entity2 shield , there 's little plant life to live off , so he would have been slowly , painfully dying when they found him			1
' it 's an amazing feat that he was able to keep himself alive this long with almost no equipment			0
' mr @entity6 's family only reported him missing in the past few weeks after he failed to return from the planned solo trip to @entity71			1
eight days into the search , mr @entity6 was spotted by a helicopter crew , but they were unable to land close by so rescue workers had to carry the malnourished hiker about a mile to the aircraft			1
raided : a black bear in a national forest destroyed food supplies and a canoe before the dog chased it away several survival experts agreed that conditions in the @entity34 wilderness were tough and , with temperatures dropping below freezing , the ordeal would have been enough to mentally break even the most experienced hiker			1
@entity91 , a @entity92 who lives on an island at the mouth of the river , told the @entity96 he had warned mr @entity6 to stay away			2
' he said it did n't scare him , but it 's not a river to travel alone , ' mr @entity91 said			0
' other adventurers have gone there over 20 , 30 years and never came back			0
' mr @entity6 is currently in serious condition in hospital .			2
