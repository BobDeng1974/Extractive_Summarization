by @entity0 @entity1 and other members of @entity4 's famous ' class of ' 92 ' squad are poised to front a £ 2billion takeover of the club , it has been claimed			1
the takeover is believed to be funded by the oil - rich @entity11 royal family and brokered by @entity1 - who spent several months playing for @entity11 - owned @entity13 before retiring last season			1
@entity1 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 are said to be in detailed talks to become the frontmen of a multi-billion consortium hoping to buy a 90 per cent stake in the club from @entity25 and @entity26 , who purchased @entity4 in 2005			1
the claims , made in @entity28 today , have not been confirmed by the former players and a spokesman for the club said it had not received any bids			2
the players are said to be in detailed talks to front a multi-billion pound takeover of the club shares in @entity4 rose by $ 16.14 on the @entity43 yesterday amid speculation over the prospective takeover bid			1
the club is currently valued at $ 2.6 billion , equal to £ 1.6 billion , despite having one of their worst seasons in living memory - including losing 3 - 0 to local rivals @entity51 on tuesday			2
the club 's underachievement this season has seen players past and present complain publicly about the way the club is performing			1
following the defeat to @entity51 , striker @entity58 admitted that rivals are no longer afraid of coming to @entity60 anymore because @entity4 are simply not good enough			2
@entity58 was left to reflect on another poor performance after admitting the team had lost their @entity60 ' fear factor '			0
owners : the ' class of ' 92 ' stars are said to be hoping to buy a 90 per cent stake in the club from @entity25 and @entity26 ( pictured ) , who purchased @entity4 in 2005 shares in @entity4 rose by $ 16.14 on the @entity43 yesterday amid speculation over a prospective takeover bid by the ' class of ' 92 ' stars the players involved in the alleged takeover bid were all members of @entity4 's 1992 youth team			1
they include @entity17 ( back row , second from left ) , @entity19 ( back row , second from right ) , @entity1 ( bottom row , second from left ) and @entity16 ( bottom row , second from right ) legends : @entity15 ( left ) and @entity18 ( right ) are another two @entity4 stars linked to the bid			1
both were considered members of the club 's famous ' class of ' 92 ' many @entity4 fans have been unhappy with the ownership of the @entity26 family since they purchased a controlling stake in the club for £ 810million in 2005			1
the initial protests came as a result of the takeover itself , as the @entity94 performed a highly leveraged buyout - effectively dumping £ 525million debt on the club overnight			1
@entity4 's board had earlier branded the @entity26 family 's plans ' aggressive '			1
debt : the @entity26 family ( @entity26 left and @entity25 right ) performed a highly leveraged takeover of @entity4 - effectively dumping £ 525million debt on the club overnight although they paid £ 270million from their own funds , the rest of the money used to purchase @entity4 came in the form of loans - the majority of which were secured against the club 's assets - which have since incurred interest payments of more than £ 60million a year			1
in the four years up to june 2009 , when @entity4 last published their accounts - the club became liable to pay more than £ 325million in interest alone , not including interest not paid			1
this increased the debt the @entity94 loaded on to the club to about £ 700million			0
many supporters felt the @entity26 family - who also own the @entity124 's @entity123 - had taken a great risk in their financial dealings			1
fans accused them of using @entity4 purely for financial gain and to remove debt from their @entity131 - business interests , adding that they had failed to understand the significance of owning one of the most successful and best supported clubs in the world			1
the @entity94 have always denied this to be the case			0
unpopular : supporter groups have taken to wearing green and gold in protest at @entity94 ownership			0
the colours were originally worn by @entity4 , who changed their name to @entity4 in 1902 as a result of the anger , from 2009 supporter groups encouraged match - going fans to wear green and gold - the colours of @entity4 - which was the original name for @entity4			1
the protest was seen as a way to remind the @entity94 of the long history of the club and to remind them there was more at stake than money			2
@entity161 and gold scarves and hats have become a symbol of resistance against the @entity94 ever since , and remain a common sight at the club 's 76,000 - seater stadium @entity60			1
troubled : the tactics used by @entity170 ( pictured ) have led to fan and even player unrest at @entity4 just over a week after describing their 3 - 0 defeat by arch - rivals @entity176 as one of the worst days he had ever had in football , the @entity174 international found himself trying to explain a similar scoreline at home to neighbours @entity51			1
the poor performance has led to rumours the club 's owners may be happy to walk away			1
' the @entity94 have lost interest			1
everyone knows the club is effectively up for sale , ' a source told @entity28 @entity192 bidders have reportedly approached the @entity94 several times about a prospective takeover , with the only sticking point on each occasion being the price , the newspaper reported			2
in 2010 the club were subject to a takeover bid from a local group dubbed the @entity201 , but they also failed because they could n't meet the @entity94 ' asking price			1
earlier this week @entity16 gave credence to rumours of discontent at the club when he gave a scathing review of current manager @entity170 during an appearance on @entity209			0
despite saying the club needs to stick by @entity211 , @entity16 was highly critical of the current crop of players and the tactics being deployed in the post sir @entity215 - era			2
lost interest ? there is speculation the @entity26 family ( @entity26 pictured centre ) are ready to sell the club decline : following the defeat to @entity51 , striker @entity58 admitted that rivals are no longer afraid of coming to @entity60 ( pictured ) anymore because @entity4 are simply not good enough protect : stewards were seen guarding a banner declaring @entity170 ' @entity227 ' from angry fans after @entity4 's defeat to @entity51 on tuesday despite rumours that the ' class of ' 92 ' players may be involved in the purchase of @entity4 , @entity17 and @entity15 are also said to be close to purchasing @entity234			1
