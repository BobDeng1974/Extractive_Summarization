by @entity0 published : 10:23 est , 20 august 2013 updated : 11:26 est , 20 august 2013 a mother has given her first television interview since she was ordered to stop breastfeeding her baby in a public swimming pool			1
appearing on this morning , @entity5 , 22 , mother of four - month - old @entity6 , defended her right to breastfeed in the toddler pool at @entity9 - an issue which divided public opinion when it came to light last week			1
' i do n't see the unhygienic part of this , ' she said , when host @entity15 expressed her misgivings about the potential dangers of feeding her son in the water - citing the veruccas , germs and bacteria present in public baths			1
' it was reported last week that @entity5 was ' waist - deep ' in the toddlers ' pool , but she now denies this , saying she was standing in the shallow end , with @entity6 raised up out of the water			1
when asked why did n't initially sit beside the pool to nurse @entity6 , she explained : ' this was n't about a feed - it was to soothe my son			1
if i 'd left the pool , it would n't have been right for @entity6			1
' there was no safety risk , there was no health risk			2
' @entity5 , with her four - month - old son @entity6 , who she attempted to breastfeed in the toddler pool at the @entity9 at the end of the interview , @entity6 joined his mother on the @entity58 sofa			1
' how could you not feed him ? ' the doting mother asked @entity61 and @entity15			1
' he should n't be the boss all the time , ' was @entity61 's reply			1
and viewers seemed to agree with him , with only 26 per cent in favour of breastfeeding in public pools in a poll conducted by the show			2
@entity69 and @entity15 ( right ) debate the issue with @entity5 ( left ) and journalist @entity27 ( far left ) thousands of readers have had their say on the website and on @entity74 about whether @entity5 should have been breastfeeding little @entity6 in the pool : @entity76 @ @entity77 tweeted : ' no breastfeeding # mailonline i 'm all for feeding but even i would n't there ! ' @entity81 , from @entity82 commented : ' i do n't see there is a problem			1
breastfeeding is the most natural thing in the world			2
i worry about some people i really do			2
' @entity89 , from @entity90 , said : ' not in a swimming pool for heavens sake			2
' living life by @entity94 , from @entity95 , commented : ' fair enough - i ca n't eat in the swimming pool nor can you little one ! but it 's not " indecent " ' @entity101 , from @entity102 in @entity103 added : ' i agree wholeheartedly with breastfeeding in public provided it is done in a discreet manner and not in full view of everyone			1
feeding in a public swimming pool is completely wrong ! after all you would n't eat your lunch whilst waist deep in a public swimming pool would you ? ? ? ? ' @entity114 from @entity115 said : ' totally disgusting , why should the rest of us and our kids be exposed to her feeding her baby in a pool , there is a time and a place for heavens sake			1
sick of breast feeding mums trying to make a point at the expense of the rest if us			1
' @entity130 , from @entity131 added : ' there 's a time and a place ; this was n't the latter			1
' @entity137 , from @entity95 , said : ' what is wrong with these women who do this			2
if you wish to feed your kid , then go somewhere else			0
not where people are swimming			0
' @entity146 , from @entity147 , commented : ' i 'm concerned that she was ' waist deep ' in the water , it does n't seem the safest place for a tiny baby breastfeeding or not			1
could have been handled better though obviously			0
' @entity154 , from @entity155 , said : ' certainly not the place for this			0
she must have known her baby was due for a feed so why get in the pool , she should have waited until after			0
' @entity161 , from @entity162 , said : ' she definitely should not do that in a swimming pool really disgusting			0
' diamonds are forever , from @entity166 , added : ' yes he was right ! ! ! there is a time and place for every thing ... i would n't want to swim in her breast milk ... nor if or when her child throws it back up again ... ... get real its a public bath ! ! ' last week , mrs @entity5 , who is on maternity leave from her customer service job at @entity182 , said : ‘ i should be allowed to breastfeed where i want			1
‘ as long as i do so tactfully and i am in within the law then i should not be harassed by people telling me to stop			0
i was humiliated and it was very distressing			0
' she said one staff member told her breastfeeding in a pool was akin to a swimmer urinating in the water and also amounted to ‘ indecent exposure ’			1
‘ they made a real scene , ' said the mother - of - two			1
' they were saying me breastfeeding was indecent exposure but i was covered more than most of the other swimmers			1
‘ one staff member also said he would stop a man urinating in the pool and that is why they did not want me breastfeeding in the water			2
’ bosses at the state - of - the - art @entity9 , a training venue for last year ’s @entity208 and @entity209 , have now apologised about the incident on sunday afternoon			1
mrs @entity5 from @entity211 , @entity9 , said she had only moved to the side of the toddlers ’ pool for a few moments to feed her son			1
‘ it was just a matter of a few seconds but the response from staff was dreadful			2
the manner in which they treated me was aggressive and upsetting and caused me major embarrassment			0
‘ if they did not like it they could have asked me quietly to stop , ’ she added			0
‘ i would have still questioned their reasons but it would not have been as inappropriate			0
’ mrs @entity5 , whose husband also works in customer service , added : ‘ this was the worst possible customer service i have ever come across			1
’ the family have made an official complaint			0
the aquatics centre , one of the largest in the country , is run by @entity237 and @entity238 , part of @entity9 council , which is investigating			1
the @entity241 has made it illegal for anyone to ask a breastfeeding woman to leave a public place such as a cafe , shop or public transport			0
however , it is not against the law to prevent a woman breastfeeding where there are legitimate health and safety risks			0
although restaurants and cafes generally do not have separate breastfeeding areas , some store chains such as @entity257 and @entity258 do provide dedicated areas away from women ’s toilets			0
other businesses have begun displaying stickers on windows telling mothers that breastfeeding is welcome on the premises			0
new mother @entity5 was ordered to stop breastfeeding her four - month - old son @entity6 in a swimming pool at the @entity274 after staff claimed feeding her son was ' indecent exposure ' and similar to someone urinating in the pool councillor @entity280 , executive member for culture and leisure at @entity9 council , said : ‘ we keenly encourage new mothers to use our leisure facilities and they have every right to breastfeed their babies when they need to do so , in line with existing legislation			1
' we have also asked that the @entity238 and @entity237 review their existing policies , to make sure that they reflect the law			0
‘ as a breastfeeding mother myself , i expect staff contracted to work in our leisure facilities to understand and respect women ’s right to breastfeed in public places			1
’ a spokesman for @entity237 said : ‘ we are fully supportive of mothers breastfeeding their child whilst in our centres			0
‘ @entity237 ’s operating practices are to encourage breastfeeding in a safe and comfortable environment for both the mother and child rather than it taking place in the swimming pool			2
‘ we will fully investigate this matter and where appropriate we will amend our policies and put in place appropriate training for staff			2
‘ we apologise for any inconvenience that was caused			0
’ @entity317 was asked to stop breastfeeding her son @entity318 at the @entity319 in @entity320 the @entity321 revealed last wednesday a mother of five burst into tears after she said she was kicked out of a @entity319 for breastfeeding her baby			2
@entity317 had taken her four - month - old son @entity318 with her to an appointment at the centre in @entity320 , south - east @entity95 , where she was meeting to discuss her income support money			1
miss @entity317 , of @entity329 , said the interviewer then told her she felt ' uncomfortable '			0
but the mother replied : ' there 's nothing uncomfortable about me breastfeeding my son , it 's natural			2
' however the interviewer was said to have told her the breastfeeding was ' disgusting ' , adding : ' if you do not stop it , i 'm terminating this interview '			0
mrs @entity317 added : ' she was raising her voice then she kicked me out and ended the interview			0

' a spokesman for @entity371 , a campaign group supporting breastfeeding in public , said : ' perceptions of breastfeeding in public still continues to be a sticking point for both new and experienced mums who choose to breastfeed			2
