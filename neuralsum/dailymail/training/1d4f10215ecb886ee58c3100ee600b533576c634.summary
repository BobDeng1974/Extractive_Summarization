controversial : police asked the @entity1 not to reveal the vigilante 's identity to protect his family this is the @entity6 man behind a disturbing phenomenon of vigilantes who set out to hunt down and trap suspected child sex offenders , and expose them on the internet			1
he is the self - appointed leader of @entity12 , a gang that closed down this week just nine months after he set it up , following the suicide of a man it accused of grooming a pre-pubescent girl for sex over the internet			1
the gang ’s members acted as detectives , judges and jurors towards those they targeted			0
first , a gang member would lure the men they suspected into the trap by striking up flirtatious conversations with them on the internet while posing as a young girl			0
next , they would agree to meet them , still pretending to be a young girl			0
at that meeting , they would confront and film them before posting the footage on the internet and giving their ‘ evidence ’ to the police			0
though police have criticised its methods , the group ’s controversial activities have led to at least ten arrests			1
none has been charged with sex offences and it remains to be seen whether they are guilty of anything			0
and while they claimed they were behind the jailing this week of pub manager @entity52 on child sex charges , police say evidence collected by the group played no part in the conviction			2
the irony is that these self - appointed investigators — whose aim was to expose the men they suspected to the full glare of publicity — operated undercover , refusing to identify themselves to the police or anyone else , claiming they risked revenge attacks			1
this week , when we tracked down their leader , he begged us not to expose him , for fear that he and his family would become targets			1
indeed , it was his fear of being identified publicly — rather than the suicide of a man he hounded — that caused him to close down his gang			2
yesterday , @entity83 police also asked us not to identify him			1
‘ we believe there is a realistic chance of him coming to some harm , ’ they said			0
‘ feelings on issues surrounding paedophilia run very high , both against those accused and against those who make such allegations			2
’ we have agreed to abide by the police ’s request — though with deep reservations , because there is no doubt this man in his black hoodie top is a highly questionable figure			2
this does not mean , however , we can not tell you his story or try to explain why he took the law into his own hands in his war on paedophiles			0
@entity113 : @entity12 members film the pursuit of a targeted man in a park the @entity12 warrior is convinced he is a messenger from @entity120 crusading against those who have committed heinous crimes and that he is entitled to punish them			2
in his 20s , he is almost evangelical about his work			0
but this week , the methods and motives of his gang were criticised after the inquest of @entity130 , a 29 - year - old engineer who hanged himself just days after the vigilante gang accused him of grooming a young girl			1
the police , @entity133 and the @entity134 were concerned about the gang ’s activities , saying they risked jeopardising police investigations			0
many claimed the videos the gang posted online of the men they suspected rarely met the tough evidential requirements needed for a criminal prosecution			0
' we believe there is a realistic chance of him coming to some harm			0
feelings on issues surrounding paedophilia run very high , both against those accused and against those who make such allegations			2
' @entity157 but what motivated this crusader ? was it the fact that his father was once attacked by a gang of vigilantes and left badly beaten ? and how does he reconcile his group ’s activity with police criticism and the death of a young man ? @entity174 ’s leader , who lives with his girlfriend , who is also in her 20s , rejects the suggestion his activities circumvent the legal system			1
he also refuses to countenance the idea that he and his gang may have contributed to @entity130 ’s death			1
he claims mr @entity130 ‘ killed himself because he tried to meet a child for sex ’			1
he adds : ‘ all our evidence was sent to the police			0
it ’s not my fault the police sent someone to arrest him			0
they were the last ones to handle him			0
’ he refused to talk further about the case , pulling his hood over his head and driving off in his convertible car with his girlfriend and their child			0
but we can reveal exactly what happened to mr @entity130			1
he went online and hooked up by mistake with one of the vigilante group , who was pretending to be a 14 - year - old girl			1
mr @entity130 , they say , showed an interest in meeting the ‘ girl ’ for sex			1
suicide : @entity130 who killed himself in may a meeting was arranged in a park in @entity83			1
it took place four months ago			1
in fact , the vigilantes sent an 18 - year - old as a decoy			1
when confronted , mr @entity130 was said to have sworn at members of @entity12 filming the encounter			1
he then left the park			0
the group say they sent a ‘ file ’ of evidence to @entity223			2
subsequently , mr @entity130 was questioned by a police officer and released on bail in may			1
he was not charged with any criminal offence			0
however , four days later he was found hanged in his garage at his home			1
the inquest into his death found he had committed suicide , though the coroner did not refer to any encounter with @entity12 or his arrest			2
while the truth about mr @entity130 ’s intentions will never be known , the group insists it was doing an important public duty by monitoring the internet to protect children from paedophiles			1
@entity12 was inspired by an @entity245 tv programme , to catch a predator , in which alleged paedophiles are filmed being lured to a house where they think they are going to meet an under - age girl for sex			2
the @entity12 group has posted a series of shaky , hand - held videos of men arriving in public places to meet girls they had been chatting to on social networks and whom they thought were willing to have sex			1
when challenged by the @entity12 team , the men ran off — while being chased by a vigilante cameraman			2
it has emerged this week that two sisters , who have been among the many who have criticised the group on @entity267 for their tactics , were subjected to thuggish comments from the group on social networking sites			1
one said she feared for the safety of her child after the name of her street was tweeted			0
meanwhile , a man who made negative comments online about the group ’s activities said he received a message from a follower that said : ‘ i will cut your throat if i see you in the street			1
’ this controversy puts the spotlight on the legality , morality and motivation of @entity12			0
in the past , during previous @entity1 investigations into its leader ’s activities , he has asked for money to pay for ‘ kit ’ for the group			1
this is despite him having told his local newspaper : ‘ i ’m not doing it for any kind of monetary gain			2
’ no longer in action : the vigilante group - whose @entity267 page is pictured - announced that it is to fold he also claims to have ‘ studied law ’ , though in reality he has no formal legal qualifications			1
what is fascinating is that when he was a teenager , his family was the subject of a vigilante attack in an apparent case of mistaken identity			1
perhaps this is why the vigilantes ’ webpage quoted the ruthless @entity323 leader , @entity322 , saying : ‘ i am the punishment of @entity120			2
if you had not committed great sins , @entity120 would not have sent a punishment like me upon you			0
’ the @entity12 leader — who calls himself ‘ @entity329 ’ — was born in the @entity330			2
his father worked in the car industry and his mother was a shop worker			0
tragically , she died two years after his birth			0
jailed : police say that none of the vigilante group 's evidence was used to convict @entity52 this week it was when he was 18 that his father was attacked			1
he was repeatedly knocked to the ground as three men punched and kicked him			0
he suffered a smashed up face and serious eye injuries			0
the attack happened near a local pub on a friday night and it was reported that the attackers had accused their victim of having recently assaulted someone			2
the @entity174 vigilante ’s father , who was 42 at the time , vehemently denied this claim			2
he said it must have been a case of mistaken identity			0
ten years on , it is his son who is the vigilante			0
last year , with his girlfriend , the @entity12 leader set up a security firm , and he is known to be keen on keeping fierce dogs			1
it has also been alleged that he has taken at least one dog with him when confronting alleged paedophiles			0
the man lived in a council property in @entity6			0
@entity369 say he ‘ ruined ’ a perfectly respectable property by carrying out unnecessary building works and now rents a semi-detached home			0
his vigilante work has been marked by a bitter rivalry with another man who also targets paedophiles			1
their respective groups have been engaged in a war of words on @entity267 , accusing one another of incompetence			0
while the @entity12 leader claims his group includes concerned parents of both sexes , the truth is that it is predominantly run by himself and two other men			2
some may wonder why the police take the group ’s videos and related ‘ evidence ’ seriously			0
the problem is that the police have a duty to respond to any claim that the law has been broken and must begin to investigate if they believe a crime might have been committed			0
one of the vigilante ’s neighbours says : ‘ what gives this man the right to think he is a latter - day @entity405 figure ? such work should be left to the police			1
’ how bitterly ironic it is that , as soon as the @entity12 leader realised he was going to be exposed , he scuttled off to the police and lawyers — a courtesy he never afforded to the people , such as suicide victim @entity130 , that he exposed online .			1
