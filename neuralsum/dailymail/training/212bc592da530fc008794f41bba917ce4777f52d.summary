by @entity0 @entity1 , the woman who , with her parents , first introduced the now famous @entity4 waffle to the @entity5 at @entity7 's @entity6 in 1964 , has detailed how the fluffy breakfast treat fast became a culinary sensation			1
' from the moment we opened there was a line			0
we could n't see the end , ' recalls ms @entity1 , 66 , who helped her parents serve an average of 2,500 waffles a day during the fair , which opened on april 22 , 1964			0
' the @entity4 family , who served their waffles topped with fresh whipped cream , powdered sugar and sliced strawberries , touted their creation as a ' light , crispy and fluffy ' alternative to the @entity5 variety			1
@entity31 delights : @entity32 were introduced to the @entity5 public at the 1964 @entity6 ( pictured ) by @entity34 and @entity35 and their daughter @entity36 the @entity37 first served the treat two years earlier at the @entity39 in @entity40 , and for years after they made the waffles at the annual @entity42 in @entity43			1
but it was at the 1964 event in @entity7 that the waffles became a sensation			1
according to ms @entity1 , they were supposed to be called @entity50 waffles â € ” named for the @entity4 capital , where they were a specialty â € ” but her mother @entity53 soon realized many @entity5 did n't know where @entity50 was			1
to this day , baby boomers fondly recall the memory of enjoying them at the fair			0
where it all began : the actual pitcher and waffle iron ( pictured ) used to make the now famous waffles , sit on a table in the @entity67 home in @entity68 , @entity7 ms @entity1 said that for years she ran a coffee shop , @entity71 's @entity70 , in her current home of @entity73 , @entity74 , that featured a picture of the 1964 @entity6			1
' people would look at the name and see the picture and say , " i ate those waffles at the @entity6 , " and they 'd pick up the phone and call their parents , ' said ms @entity1 , who is in @entity7 to attend the fair 's 50th anniversary celebration this month , and also to care for her 95 - year - old mother , who lives in @entity68			1
' i could n't believe how often that would happen			0
' what made the waffles so good ? ms @entity1 cites a special cast - iron pan that heats up to 500 degrees			0
family ties : @entity35 , 95 , ( left ) and her daughter , @entity36 , 66 , ( right ) pose for a photo in their home , 50 years after they introduced @entity4 waffles to @entity5 ' as soon as the batter touches the grill , it gets crispy on the outside and soft on the inside , ' she says			1
' you do n't want to put anything syrupy on it or it will turn it into a sponge			0
' they served the waffles with whipped cream , adding hand - sliced strawberries for color			2
waffles in the @entity5 date back to the @entity116 , who were familiar with them from time spent in the @entity118 , which has a similar waffle culture			2
from the moment we opened there was a line			0
we could n't see the end and during the latter part of the 18th century , ' waffle parties ' were all the rage			0
today , a version of the @entity4 waffle can be found in diners and restaurants across the country			0
ms @entity1 said she vowed never to create an instant mix because the recipe requires fresh , carefully prepped ingredients : pure vanilla , fresh yeast or self - rising flour , melted but cooled sweet butter , and eggs at room temperature , with egg whites added at the end			2
but that 's as much information as she 'll divulge			0
about 12 years ago , she sold the @entity147 recipe to a @entity43 family on condition that it be served only at the @entity42			1
the exact recipe , she says , is a secret .			2

delicacy was first served in the @entity5 by @entity34 and @entity35 and daughter @entity71 at @entity7 's @entity155
family recipe remains a *closely* *guarded* secret
