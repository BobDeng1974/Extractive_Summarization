by @entity1 reporter published : 11:10 est , 31 march 2013 updated : 11:14 est , 31 march 2013 eight out of 10 women say they still do more housework than their husbands @entity6 has failed working class women by focussing too much on gender equality in high profile roles , according to new research			1
eight out of 10 married women still do more housework than their husbands , according to the research by think - tank @entity14 ( @entity14 ) , while just one in 10 married men do an equal amount and 13 per cent do more			1
despite this , the number of ' house husbands ' in @entity20 trebled over the last 15 years , with 62,000 men staying at home to care for their family and remaining economically inactive			1
while the average gap between the earnings of men and women has narrowed in the last 50 years , differences between professional and unskilled women are significantly higher than those between men , a report by the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) found			1
with or without a university degree , men continue to earn more than their female counterparts			1
but researchers found that women with a degree born in 1958 earned nearly three times as much as women in unskilled jobs born in the same year - compared to a difference of less than half between men in the same groups			2
@entity46 , @entity14 associate director , said : ' while feminism has delivered for some professional women , other women have been left behind			2
' many of the advances for women at the top have masked inequality at the bottom			0
' the " break - the - glass - ceiling " approach that simply promotes " women in the boardroom " has not been as successful in changing family - friendly working culture or providing opportunities for other women to advance			0
' gender still has a strong independent impact on women 's earnings prospects - but class , education and occupational backgrounds are stronger determinants of a woman 's progression and earnings prospects			0
motherhood was also a key factor , with women who had children earlier seeing their earnings prospects decrease compared to those who postponed forming a family , the study found			2
for men the reverse was true , as fathers enjoyed a ' fatherhood pay bonus ' which saw them earn more than men without children			0
the @entity14 called for a more progressive parental leave system , more affordable and accessible childcare and better paid part - time jobs to address these issues			0
it also warned against the ' decoy effect ' of focussing on women in high profile positions , and said the breaking down of stereotypes should be the priority			0
researchers discovered that @entity20 men and women increasingly marry partners from their same social group , with a decline in women ' marrying up ' and a small increase of women ' marrying down .			1
