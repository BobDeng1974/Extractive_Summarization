@entity1 searchers have said electronic ' pings ' initially thought to have come from missing @entity4 flight may not have emanated from the plane at all			1
a senior @entity7 naval officer said he ' increasingly suspects ' some of the signals detected last month did n't come from the jetliner 's black - box flight recorders , piling further doubts over the search effort			1
@entity7 naval commander @entity13 said of four ' pings ' picked up by the @entity17 's @entity16 - 21 autonomous underwater vehicle , two were too weak to have been from a man - made device			1
but two of them now appear to have been too weak to have been from a man - made devic search teams picked up two signals on april 5 at a frequency of @entity37 before two more were received three days later at @entity38			1
while both are significantly lower than the @entity36 black box beacons are designed to emit , the april 5 signals are still possible , down perhaps to weakening batteries or the ' vagaries of deep - sea conditions '			2
@entity45 , captain of the @entity28 vessel , said : ' as far as frequency goes , between 33 khz and 27 @entity48 is a pretty large jump			0
' he did say the authorities still believe that the two april 5 signals , one of which was held for 2 hours and 20 minutes - are consistent with black - box locator beacons			2
fresh doubts : @entity7 naval commander @entity13 said while both readings are significantly lower than the @entity36 black box beacons are designed to emit , the april 5 signals are still possible , down perhaps to weakening batteries or the ' vagaries of deep - sea conditions ' so what was it ? dolphins can produce echolocation signals of anywhere between @entity66 and @entity67 to obtain sonic information about their environment @entity45 did not give any clues as to what may have emitted the april 8 ' pings ' if they did not indeed come from @entity1			1
dolphins can produce echolocation signals of anywhere between @entity66 and @entity67 to obtain sonic information about their environment			0
experts say dolphins ' lower frequency vocalizations ( between about 0.2 and @entity78 ) are likely used in social communication while higher frequency clicks ( 40 to 150 khz ) are primarily used for spacial awareness			0
days after the signals were detected , @entity7 prime minister @entity82 said he was ' very confident ' they were from the black box on @entity1			2
embarrassing : days after the signals were detected , @entity7 prime minister @entity82 said he was ' very confident ' they were from the black box on @entity1 ' we have very much narrowed down the search area ... and we are very confident the signals are from the black box from @entity1 , ' he said			1
' we have a series of detections , some lasting for quite a long period of time			0
' we 're now getting to the stage from where the black box is starting to fade			0
we 're hoping to get as much information as we can before the signal finally expires			0
' i really do n't want to give any more information than that at this stage ... as a sign of respect to the @entity104 people and their families			0
' the @entity107 firm whose satellites helped track the final route of missing @entity4 airliner @entity1 , is to offer a free , basic tracking service to prevent other flights from disappearing			1
@entity114 said today that the service would be offered to all 11,000 commercial passenger aircraft which are already equipped with @entity114 satellite connection , comprising virtually 100 percent of the world 's long haul commercial fleet			1
it 's launch comes two months after @entity121 went missing without a trace on march 8 with 239 passengers on board			1
it still has not been found despite a multi-agency , international search effort , including fruitless analysis by @entity114 's own network of satellites			1
nerve centre : the control room at @entity114			2
@entity1 automatically sent hourly signals to a satellite belonging to the @entity107 firm after the plane 's transponder and all communication systems had shut down			1
yet , not a single piece of wreckage from the lost plane has been found , not even after a new analysis led investigators to change the focus of their search yet again it was very brief electronic ' pings ' from @entity114 equipment on the lost plane that prompted investigators to look for wreckage in the @entity24			1
' in the wake of the loss of @entity1 , we believe this is simply the right thing to do , ' chief executive @entity149 said			2
' this offer responsibly , quickly and at little or no cost to the industry , addresses in part the problem brought to light by the recent tragic events around @entity1			1
' it said at its results last week that it would make available free data transfers for a position reporting service			0
it would see a plane determine its location using gps and then transmit that data - together with a heading , speed and altitude - over @entity114 's global network of satellites every 15 minutes			1
still nothing : a map of the most recent search area , which is 5,700 feet off the coast of @entity177 looking : captain flt lt @entity178 of the @entity180 @entity179 flying a p - 3 orion during a search trying to locate missing @entity1 over the @entity24 the @entity4 jet lost contact with air traffic controllers on march 8 and data from @entity114 's satellite network was analysed to deduce the airliner 's flight path			1
but it has still not been found and investigators appear no closer to finding it as they were two months ago when the plane mysteriously vanished from the world 's radars			1
not a single piece of wreckage from the lost plane has been found , not even after a new analyses led investigators to repeatedly change the focus of their search			0
the latest search area is based on extremely limited satellite data combined with radar data taken some five hours before the plane is believed to have gone down			2
it is , as one search official said , ' a very inexact science			0
' the aircraft could indeed still be in the area planes and ships from several countries have been combing in recent weeks			0
each unsuccessful day , though , adds to the skepticism			0
disappeared : the @entity4 @entity214 which vanished two months ago without trace a source told the @entity217 that if they were to find debris from the jet it would be down to ' luck ' and they might need to expand the search sources said that while the plane could be on land , the possibility of a specific country hiding the plane was ' absurd ' ' without any kind of proof , uncertainty rules the day , ' said @entity232 , a satellite imagery expert at @entity234 in @entity235 , @entity236			2
' people still ca n't wrap their head around how a modern airplane that big could just go missing in the modern world			2
' the focus of the search has changed repeatedly since air traffic controllers lost contact with the @entity214 between @entity245 and @entity246			0
it began in the @entity248 , then shifted toward the @entity249 to the west , where @entity245 officials eventually confirmed that military radar had detected the plane			0
then came evidence that the plane had continued flying for at least five hours after contact was lost			0
the plane automatically sent hourly signals to a satellite belonging to @entity114 after the plane 's transponder and all communication systems had shut down			1
the ' pings ' did not include specific location information , but the team of experts who studied them said they must have come from one of two vast arcs that ran through both the @entity270 and @entity271 hemispheres			0
days of costly and fruitless searches off the coast of @entity177 since then have employed satellites , advanced aircraft and ships , but so far there have only been dead ends			0
' the problem is , we 're dealing with probabilities â€” estimates , ' @entity232 said of the @entity114 data			2
' it 's where they think the plane went down			0

searchers now say 2 of 4 ' pings ' picked up ' too weak ' to be man made
comes as satellite firm used in search for @entity1 offers low - cost tracking system to prevent another flight disappearing
service to be offered to all commercial aircraft with @entity114 satellite link
that comprises virtually 100 percent of world 's long haul commercial fleet
@entity121 has now been missing for two months
