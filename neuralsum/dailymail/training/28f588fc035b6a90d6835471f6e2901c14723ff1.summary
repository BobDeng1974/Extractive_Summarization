@entity0 and the @entity1 are set to launch missile strikes against the @entity4 regime in retaliation for its barbaric chemical attack on civilians			2
@entity8 and @entity9 discussed the plan in a 40 - minute phone call at the weekend and will finalise the details within 48 hours			1
the two leaders want to send a clear warning to dictator @entity15 over the deaths of as many as 1,300 people , many of them children			1
‘ we can not , in the 21st century , allow the idea that chemical weapons can be used with impunity – that people can be killed in this way and that there are no consequences for it , ’ insisted the foreign secretary			2
‘ we believe it is very important there is a very strong response so that dictators , whether @entity15 or others who might slaughter their own people , know that using chemical weapons is to cross a line , and that the world will respond			1
’ @entity53 commanders in the region are preparing to take part in the assault , which is likely to be unleashed within ten days			2
government sources indicated the cruise missile blitz is likely to be short and sharp and will not signal an intention to get involved in the bloody civil war in @entity4			2
but it will inevitably lead to fears that @entity0 could get sucked into another @entity64 - style nightmare			1
military planners in @entity66 and @entity67 are addressing the ‘ significant challenge ’ of finalising a list of potential targets designed to cripple @entity15 ’s chemical warfare capability			1
the intervention is likely to involve missile strikes rather than an airborne bombing campaign , in order to avoid the dangers posed by the sophisticated air defences supplied to @entity4 by @entity78			2
a @entity0 source said ‘ naval assets in the region ’ were likely to be involved , suggesting the possible use of submarine - borne @entity82 cruise missiles			1
in an ominous development @entity86 last night warned @entity1 president @entity9 that any intervention would not be a ‘ walk in the park ’ , adding : ‘ it will bring chaos and the region will burn			1
’ @entity94 warned the @entity95 it would face ‘ severe consequences ’ if it intervened in @entity4			2
and @entity78 , which has blocked @entity98 action against @entity4 , said unilateral action by the @entity95 would undermine efforts for peace and have a ‘ devastating impact ’ on the security situation in the @entity104			2
the @entity4 regime last night attempted to head off a military intervention by the @entity95 by announcing it would finally allow @entity98 experts to visit the gas atrocity site in @entity86			2
inspectors are expected to begin their work today			1
death toll : hundreds died in the alleged chemical attacks , including many women and children calling @entity15 a ' thug ' and a ' murderer , ' @entity117 declared , ' history would judge us all extraordinarily harshly if we turned a blind eye to a dictator 's use of chemical weapons			1
' ' evidence ' : secretary of state @entity117 said images like these contributed to the @entity1 assessment that chemical weapons were used in @entity4 but @entity66 and @entity67 dismissed the move , saying it was ‘ too late to be credible ’ , and followed almost a week of shelling of the area during which much of the evidence may have been destroyed			2
@entity0 , the @entity1 and @entity134 have all blamed the @entity15 regime for the attack because the rebel fighters are not thought to have the capability to carry out an atrocity on that scale			1
president @entity141 , who spoke to mr @entity8 yesterday , is also pushing for swift military retaliation and could authorise the use of @entity134 forces in the attack			1
in a statement following the talks , @entity145 said the two men ‘ agreed that a chemical weapons attack against the @entity4 people on the scale that was emerging demanded a firm response from the international community			2
this crime must not be swept under the carpet			2
’ mr @entity141 ’s office said : ‘ @entity134 is determined that this act does not go unpunished			2
’ a government source said the prime minister had not abandoned hope of achieving tougher @entity98 action against @entity4 in the future			2
but with @entity78 frustrating progress , the source said mr @entity8 believed any short - term military response would have to be taken outside the @entity98 process			1
‘ this looks like one of the worst chemical weapons attacks of modern times , ’ another @entity159 source said			0
‘ if you are responding to an attack on this scale you have to do it quickly			0
if you let it go for two , three , four weeks there is a danger you send a message that it does n’t matter			1
’ just one section of the huge @entity183 refugee camp in @entity64 which is now home to thousands of displaced @entity4 refugee siblings in the camp eat watermelons being distributed by the @entity188 @entity98 aid agencies say the number of children fleeing @entity4 has now reached one million one of the @entity194 refugees protects himself from the sun with a shemagh while walking through the camp a grandmother and mother with a disabled child who fled from @entity4 to the camp in @entity64 deputy prime minister @entity202 has discussed the crisis several times with mr @entity8 in recent days and a senior @entity206 source said there would be an agreed @entity209 response			1
‘ the government is working as one on this , ’ the source said			0
a government source said it was ‘ possible ’ that @entity216 could be recalled early from its summer recess this week to discuss the crisis			0
but the source stressed that mr @entity8 had always reserved the ‘ flexibility ’ to order a military strike in response to fast - moving events without recourse to @entity216			1
former @entity206 leader @entity224 yesterday warned against rushing to military action on @entity4			0
but @entity224 , who remains close to mr @entity202 , acknowledged that the @entity98 would be ‘ greatly diminished ’ if the world failed to respond to @entity15 ’s ‘ terrible breach ’ of international law			1
@entity229 , the ranking @entity230 on the @entity232 foreign affairs committee , said he had spoken to the @entity9 administration about its plans for @entity4 and believed the president would seek authorisation from @entity237			1
‘ i think we will respond in a surgical way and i hope the president as soon as we get back to @entity66 will ask for authorisation from @entity237 to do something in a very surgical and proportional way , ’ he told @entity238			0
a @entity145 spokesman said : ‘ no decisions have been taken on military action and the timetable for a serious response from the international community is not yet clear			0
‘ we are very conscious of when mps are due to return and have n’t ruled out recalling them earlier			0
’ shadow foreign secretary @entity252 said it is right that the @entity0 works with the international community to find a solution on @entity4 @entity8 was under pressure to recall @entity216 last night to debate the @entity4 crisis before @entity0 launches any missile strikes			1
labour politicians , backed by @entity261 counterparts , said it was essential that mps had their say on such a potentially momentous move			0
shadow foreign secretary @entity252 said : ‘ in light of ongoing international developments , it is right that the @entity0 works with the international community to try to find an agreed way forward in @entity4			0
if , in reality , the prime minister is now considering military options involving @entity0 personnel then of course i would expect him to seek a recall of @entity216 and to come to the @entity276 and make his case in advance of a decision being made			0
’ @entity280 , a @entity261 mp and former military commander , said : ‘ @entity216 may well have to be recalled before we take any military action , because then that gives us justification			0
‘ we ’re not going to get a @entity287 resolution because the @entity78 are n’t up for it , and the @entity288 certainly are n’t			0
’ he said that if it was confirmed that the @entity4 regime was responsible for the chemical weapons attacks then @entity0 would have to act			0
‘ we should n’t just talk , ’ he added			0
‘ we would have to actually act , and by acting we probably mean some kind of punitive warning action using missiles			1
that means military action – that means a recall of @entity216			0
’ fellow @entity261 mp @entity299 indicated she would oppose any military intervention in @entity4 that did not have the full backing of the @entity98			0
dr @entity299 , one of many in her party who is sceptical about the benefits of any intervention , said : ‘ @entity216 must be recalled before , not after , any decision on military involvement or action in @entity4			0
‘ i do n’t believe unilateral @entity311 intervention in @entity4 can achieve anything other than escalation into a global conflict			0
’ @entity263 are away from @entity315 for another week on @entity216 ’s long summer recess			0
@entity8 indicated before the recess that he would recall @entity216 before taking any step toward war , such as arming the @entity4 rebels			1
a @entity145 source said it was possible @entity216 would be recalled this week to discuss the crisis			0
but the source said the prime minister had always stressed that the government needed the ‘ flexibility ’ to respond to major events without recourse to @entity216			0
speaking in the @entity330 before the summer , mr @entity8 said : ‘ we make a big commitment to come to this @entity276 and explain , vote and all the rest of it but governments have to reserve the ability to take action swiftly on this or other issues			1
’ technically the prime minister has the power to authorise military action without the approval of @entity216			0
but in practice , all major military interventions in recent times , including the wars in @entity64 and @entity347 have gone ahead only after a @entity330 vote			0
however , government sources last night suggested the missile attacks being planned against @entity4 were simply a response to last week ’s chemical weapons atrocity			0
a source said any strikes should not be seen as a sign that further action , such as bombing raids , no - fly zones or arming @entity4 ’s rebels , will follow			1
the prime minister has the power to declare war as a result of the wide - ranging royal prerogative – powers held by the @entity367 and exercised by the government of the day			1
in 2006 , mr @entity8 questioned whether a prime minister should continue to be able to use the royal prerogative to declare war or sign international treaties without first consulting mps .			1
