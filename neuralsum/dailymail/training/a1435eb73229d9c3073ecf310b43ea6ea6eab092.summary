by @entity0 the mp who first raised the alarm against @entity3 last night warned that @entity4 was ' turning a blind eye ' to sexual harassment in the corridors of power			1

she said senior political figures have many ' questions to answer ' over the culture of the @entity4 , dubbed the ' @entity18 '			1
the mp spoke out days after fellow conservative mr @entity3 , the former commons deputy speaker , was cleared of eight charges of sex attacks on young men , including one of rape			2
speaking out : @entity8 said she had faced ' rank hostility ' from colleagues whom she accused of turning on her over her decisions to report allegations against @entity3 the case went to court after dr @entity8 raised allegations she had heard from an alleged victim with the commons speaker @entity31			1
mr @entity3 said he had been the victim of a machiavellian plot and said dr @entity8 had ' decided to have it in ' for him			1
but last night he claimed he bore no ill will towards dr @entity8			1
' [ if i met her ] i 'd say , " @entity36 , let 's have a chat " , and no doubt at some stage we will , ' he told @entity42			0
' it 's difficult for anybody to be put in the position that @entity8 was put in , and then to think , " what would you do if somebody came to you with something like that ? " , and so i do n't blame her			1
' it emerged last night that former @entity9 leadership contender @entity52 had organised a welcome back to @entity54 party for mr @entity3 , the mp for @entity55 , to be held next week			0
after mr @entity3 's acquittal a survey for @entity56 uncovered evidence of a culture of excessive drinking between some mps and young male researchers in commons bars			0
writing for the @entity66 's website , dr @entity8 said : ' this process was never going to be easy			2
but i have been truly shocked by the rank hostility since mr @entity3 's acquittal , from those who seriously feel i should have done nothing			1
how can it be acceptable for a third of the 70 researchers interviewed by @entity56 to have experienced sexual harassment at @entity4 ? ' the people who truly have questions to answer are those who have for so long turned a blind eye to the reports of such harassment			1
i did n't , and do n't , want to be one of them			0
' one of the alleged victims in the case spoke to police last may after telling dr @entity8 what he claimed had happened			2
she informed mr @entity31 , who said it was a police matter after being told another young man had accused mr @entity3 of rape			0
in court , mr @entity3 said that the alleged rape had been consensual sex , and accused other complainants of telling ' absurd ' stories as part of a co-ordinated effort to wreck his political career			0
dr @entity8 wrote : ' following his acquittal on nine charges of rape and sexual assault , @entity3 – the former deputy speaker – has claimed that i " had it in for him "			1
' others have demanded that i apologise , and reflect on my role in the case			0
' to them , i ask : what would you do if , in a social setting , someone told you that they had been sexually assaulted by one of your most popular colleagues ? ' would you have laughed off the allegation , or brushed it aside ? i did not			0
' she revealed that since the verdict , she had spoken to the young men and ' offered to stand down as an mp if they feel that i pressured them to take the complaint forward '			0
' both are clear that i did not do so , and that i discussed with them the risks of doing so as well as their own concerns about protecting others , ' she said			0
and she also rejected mr @entity3 ' argument that rape suspects should be given anonymity			0
' few cases make it to a courtroom and fewer still result in a conviction , ' she said			0
' changing the rules on anonymity would slash reporting rates even further			2
' dr @entity8 , who is a gp , said she felt she had to pass on the allegations because she was a member of the @entity139 health select committee which has called for doctors to be struck off if they fail to report serious allegations about colleagues			1
' it would have been rank hypocrisy to demand that standard from my fellow doctors , while failing to be prepared to do so myself , ' she said .			2

@entity8 said she faced ' rank hostility ' after reporting allegations
she said there are ' questions to answer ' over sexual harassment
