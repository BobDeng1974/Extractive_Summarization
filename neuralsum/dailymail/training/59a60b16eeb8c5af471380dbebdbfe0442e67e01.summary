by @entity0 @entity1 is set to get an inflation - busting pay rise of 22 per cent for 2014/2015 the @entity1 is set to receive an inflation - busting 22 per cent ‘ pay rise ’ over two years , according to new official figures			1
the monarch is said to be ‘ down to her last £ 1 million ’ , leaving her vulnerable to ‘ unexpected costs ’ , a report has said			1
she is now expected to be given £ 37.9 million in 2014 - 15 to run her @entity10 and conduct official engagements , up from £ 31 million in 2012 - 13			1
the figures were released yesterday by the @entity13 which has , for the first time , been allowed to examine all aspects of the @entity1 ’s funding as @entity17			1
but while recommending the increase , their report goes on to highlight what it describes as ‘ significant reductions ’ in the monarchy ’s funding over the last 20 years			1
it says that grants for royal travel on official engagements both at home and abroad has been slashed by 76 per cent in real terms			0
the maintenance for royal palaces , including @entity33 and @entity34 , was similarly reduced by an impressive 60 per cent			0
that has left , according to the @entity13 , a huge backlog in property maintenance , with 39 per cent of occupied royal palace being deemed below their ‘ target condition ’			0
in order to cope with the shortfall the @entity1 ’s money men have been dramatically scaling back their spending , reducing net expenditure by 55 per cent in real terms			1
according to the figures , that led to real - term expenditure of £ 32.9 million in 2011 - 2012 , compared to £ 72.6million in 1991 - 92			1
in order to help meet the shortfall , the @entity1 has repeatedly eaten into her savings - known as ‘ drawing down on reserves ’ - over the years and is , apparently , down to her last £ 1 million in the bank			1
@entity1 , shown meeting @entity54 of @entity55 at @entity33			2
the @entity13 has , for the first time , been allowed to examine all aspects of the @entity1 's funding as @entity17 the @entity13 , which scrutinises public spending for @entity60 and is independent of government , says this poses serious questions about the palace ’s ability to cope in an unexpected crisis if , say , the roof of @entity33 fell down			1
‘ as part of its long - term planning the @entity10 may need to consider whether the @entity70 is adequate to meet unexpected costs , ’ it says			2
the @entity13 report will be put before parliament ’s powerful @entity73 on monday as part of as investigation into royal finances			0
until last year the monarch was funded by a complicated combination of civil list payments and government grants			2
following an extensive review of royal finances by the government , the @entity1 now receives one single pot of money known as the @entity87 to largely spend as she wishes on everything from funding her office to repairing the palace roof			2
the maintenance for royal palaces , including @entity33 and @entity34 , has been reduced by 60 per cent over the last 20 years in each of the last six years , the @entity1 ’s programme has on average seen her conduct more than 300 engagements in addition to 3,000 trips by the rest of the @entity100 , six gardens parties and more than 26 investitures			1
the money is taken from the @entity104 , a wealthy portfolio of agricultural land , buildings and property - ranging from a retail park in @entity109 to @entity111 ’s @entity110 - which historically belonged to the monarchy but the profits of which have , since the reign of @entity116 , gone to the @entity117			0
this year the @entity104 announced record revenue of £ 253 million as a result of protracted - and sometimes combative - negotiations with @entity122 , the monarch is now , for the first time in two centuries , entitled to keep 15 per cent of its profits with the rest going to the @entity117			1
this year the @entity104 announced record revenue of £ 253 million			1
its entire holdings are now worth an astonishing £ 8.1 billion and the @entity13 says that profits are likely to continue to rise , meaning the @entity1 will enjoy further increases in funding to come			1
the palace insists most of its extra cash will be spent on a ‘ massive backlog ’ of repairs to royal palaces , which the @entity1 holds in trust on behalf of the nation			2
it has long complained of having to put off millions of pounds worth of essential repairs due to those real - term falls in funding			0
buckets are frequently used to catch water leaks in the picture gallery while none of the state rooms , regularly used for entertaining heads of state , have not been decorated in more than sixty years			0
the new @entity13 report also highlights the royal household ’s efforts to increase income through money - spinning schemes such as renting out its facilities for commercial events			0
this has generated a rise of 54 per cent in profits , £ 11.6 million last year alone			1
other nuggets in the report show that the monarch ’s 436 staff cost her £ 19.5million a year , although anyone earning more than £ 21,000 has had their pay frozen since 2011 in a bid to cut bills			1
last year the family spent £ 4.5 million on travel , a real term reduction of 30 per cent in the last decade , as royals were told to stop using private jets and take scheduled flights instead			1
of that £ 900,000 was spent on rail journeys last year and £ 1.6 million on helicopters			1
the royal train , which was used just 15 times last year at an average cost of more than £ 25,000 is now under review again			2
@entity179 receives an mbe from the @entity1 at an @entity181 at @entity33 in central @entity111 yesterday if you ’re worried that your children or grandchildren will grow up more interested in @entity185 than fairytales , you ’re not alone			2
in fact , you have an unlikely new champion – the @entity1			2
she has shared her fears that children are more likely to play computer games or read e-books than settle down with a traditional story			0
it is highly unusual for the @entity1 to openly express an opinion on such issues			2
she made the comments as she presented author @entity179 with an mbe for services to literature at @entity33 yesterday			0
miss @entity179 is perhaps best known for her bestselling novel @entity201			0
asked about her chat with the @entity1 yesterday , miss @entity179 said : ‘ she asked me what i thought about e-books and computer games and said that she feared children were playing with those more than they were reading books			0
‘ so i told her that we start them on e-books and computer games and tv and then try to get them on to books later			0
’ she added of her mbe : ‘ it ’s wonderful to be recognised and it ’s wonderful to see the world of literature be recognised every time this happens to one of us			0
’ earlier this year , the @entity224 revealed that most children preferred to read on screens rather than from books , but those who used the new technology had weaker literacy skills			0
and research published this week shows tablets have become a ‘ must - have accessory ’ for toddlers			0
half of @entity237 ’s two and three - year - olds use one , the @entity236 survey revealed			0
@entity239 , @entity240 member of the @entity73 , who set to quiz the @entity1 ’s chief ‘ bean counter ’ , @entity245 sir @entity244 , on monday as part of the royal finances investigation said : ‘ it is the first time the pac or parliament has had this level of access to the @entity10 ’s accounts			1
‘ we want to show we take our responsibilities very seriously and be sure the @entity10 is giving good value for money			0
‘ i think this kind of scrutiny can only be good for the monarchy			0
