by @entity0 published : 12:37 est , 17 january 2014 updated : 09:03 est , 18 january 2014 at first glance these images may appear commonplace , but in actual fact they are highly realistic sculptures made from a single piece of pine			1
artist @entity7 uses only @entity9 white pine and acrylic paint to create these stunning designs , which look just like real - life objects			2
from flimsy newsprint , toworn trading cards , translucent pieces of tape and even deteriorating cardboard boxes , @entity7 creates them all in his workshop			1
what 's even more impressive is that he does n't work from a photograph or model , but instead creates each object as he goes , using only an image in his mind as a guide			0
after graduating from the @entity27 in the late 1960s @entity7 opened his first exhibition of surrealist paintings , a direction he pursued until the late 80s			2
his focus then shifted to architectural design and next into the realist sculptures he creates today			0
this may look like a cardboard box full of money , but it is in fact a wooden carving by artist @entity7 the @entity42 born artist uses a single piece of @entity9 white pine to make each of the sculptures @entity7 creates each image by picturing it is his mind , rather than working for a real life object he then uses acrylic paint in order to finish the highly realistic artwork by adding texture and detail after the paint has dried @entity7 adds elastic bands , tape , and a parcel label to the outside of the box while this may appear to be the start of a delicious dinner , it is in fact made entirely of painted wood the first stage of any project is to use a chisel to carve out the basic design to be built on later @entity7 then uses more precise tools to add detail and texture , including the impressive twisted elastic bands these hard - wood structures are a far cry from the surrealist art @entity7 produced when he first left college the finished product appears exactly like a box of old baseball trading cards hyper - realistic : in this model @entity7 has even painted the outline of the notes on the outside of this envelope to give it the appearance of being translucent @entity7 uses his painting techniques to create sticky tape which seems transparent , as in this baseball album @entity7 takes up to two weeks to create each work , using paint and a ' micron ' pen with archival ink @entity7 's work is so realistic that the crossword on the back of this newspaper was actually solved , by @entity7 , at his his coffee table @entity7 has been making the artworks for two years , after switching from surrealist painting every single detail on these newspapers , from the pictures to the text , is hand painted by @entity7 @entity7 says the key to getting things looking realistic is to start by making them looking bigger than they need to be , then slowly carving in more and more detail until they reach the proper size ' undercutting ' each paper , making it appear balanced on the paper underneath , is the key part of the process			1
after that nothing about the carving can be changed baseball , newspapers and money are all favourite subjects of @entity7 's @entity7 's eye for fine print was tested to the extreme on this precise map			0
he says he often works for weeks on minute details which often nobody notices			0

@entity7 , from @entity42 , carves these amazing sculptures
each piece takes up to two weeks to make from scratch
@entity7 says the hardest thing to get right is the *effect* of cardboard
