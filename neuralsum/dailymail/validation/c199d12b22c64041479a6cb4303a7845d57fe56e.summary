@entity0 condemned critics who try to ' excuse ' terrorists including @entity4 by pointing the finger of blame at the security services @entity26 citizens who travel to @entity27 and @entity28 to fight against @entity3 could face prosecution if they return			1
@entity0 said that parents and schools have a responsibility to help prevent young people from travelling abroad to take part in the conflict in @entity28 and @entity27			1
asked what the authorities ' response would be to @entity26 who take up arms against @entity41 , the foreign secretary said : ' the simple , legal answer is that anyone conducting irregular fighting activity overseas is subject to @entity26 legislative sanction			1
' that is unlawful activity and can be dealt with on their return to the @entity26			0
' the parents of three @entity6 schoolgirls believed to have entered @entity28 with the aim of joining is - @entity53 , 15 , @entity54 , 16 , and 15 - year - old @entity55 - are later due to appear before the @entity56 , alongside the ambassador of @entity58			0
@entity8 sparked outrage last month with its attempts to justify @entity13 's brutal killings of @entity3 hostages			1
in an extraordinary press conference , the group 's research director @entity63 said @entity67 - born @entity66 was a ' beautiful young man ' , ' extremely gentle ' and ' the most humble young person that i ever knew '			1
the 32 - year - old blamed @entity26 security services for @entity13 's radicalisation , saying he had tried to fit in but had been made to feel like an ' outsider '			1
today mr @entity0 vehemently rejected the idea that the actions of @entity76 and other @entity3 murderers can ever be justified			1
he said : ' the exposure of the alleged identity of one of the most murderous @entity3 terrorists over the last few weeks has seen some seeking to excuse the terrorists and point the finger of blame at the agencies themselves			2
' we are absolutely clear : the responsibility for acts of terror rests with those who commit them			2
but a huge burden of responsibility also lies with those who act as apologists for them			1
' in a rare speech on the intelligence agencies , mr @entity0 will mount a strong defence of their work saying that it was only their ' brilliance ' that had kept @entity26 safe in the face of the continuing terrorist threat			2
the agencies have also faced criticism over the fact that @entity13 was allowed to travel to @entity28 - where is believed to have carried out the brutal beheadings of a series of western hostages - even though he had be known to @entity12 since 2008			1
speaking at the @entity110 in @entity6 , mr @entity0 - who is responsible for @entity112 and @entity113 - said that agencies are currently facing an ' unprecedented ' level of challenge in the face of a wide range threats from around the world			2
' the sheer number and range of cases , old and new , amounts to the greatest challenge to our collective security for decades and places unprecedented demands on those charged with keeping us safe , ' he said			0
' @entity131 ' @entity8 's research director @entity63 ( left ) at a press conference about @entity4 last week prime minister @entity133 dismissed as ' nonsense ' the suggestion that jihadis like @entity13 had been radicalised by their contact with security services			1
mr @entity133 told @entity140 radio : ' the fact is we face a terrorist threat in @entity26			0
that is the opinion of the experts who advise me and set the threat level			0
' our police and security services have a very important role to play to find out about people that could do us harm and to step in and prevent them from doing that			0
' of course we need to work with communities to do that - and we do			0
' but i totally reject the idea that police or security service tactics have somehow radicalised people			0
that is , i think , nonsense			0
' campaign group @entity8 sparked outrage last month with its attempts to justify @entity13 's brutal killings of @entity3 hostages			1
in an extraordinary press conference , the group 's research director @entity63 said @entity67 - born @entity66 was a ' beautiful young man ' , ' extremely gentle ' and ' the most humble young person that i ever knew '			2
the 32 - year - old blamed @entity26 security services for @entity13 's radicalisation , saying he had tried to fit in but had been made to feel like an ' outsider '			1
he said that while in the past they had simply had to focus on ' ideologically - driven expansionist states ' they now had to deal with international terrorist groups and state - sponsored aggression as well as self - radicalised , ' lone wolf ' terrorists			2
' the emergence of groups such as @entity182 in @entity183 and ( @entity41 ) in @entity28 , @entity27 and @entity184 , simply serves to underline the pace with which the threats to our safety and security from this source are evolving , ' he said			0
' it is only thanks to the dedication , and in many cases the brilliance , of our intelligence officers that we have succeeded to detect and contain these threats			0
' at the same time he pointed to the renewed threat to international order posed by @entity200 after years of re-engagement with the @entity202 following the end of the @entity204			0
' we are now faced with a @entity200 leader bent not on joining the international rules - based system which keeps the peace between nations , but on subverting it , ' he said			0
' president ( @entity213 ) @entity212 's actions - illegally annexing @entity214 and now using @entity200 troops to destabilise eastern @entity216 - fundamentally undermine the security of sovereign nations in @entity219			0
' he said that the ' clandestine nature ' of the threats - from weapons systems developed in secret to covert plotting by terrorists - underlined the need for @entity26 to maintain a ' highly effective , secret capability ' to identify , monitor and act against them			2
' as the range of threats gets bigger , so the pace of technological change with which the agencies must keep up is getting faster , making their central task of keeping us safe ever more demanding , ' he said			0
' we must respond decisively and positively to the public and parliamentary debate about the powers required by our intelligence agencies to do their job in a changed technological environment - and in doing so draw a line under that debate so that the agencies can get on with the job of keeping this country safe			0
