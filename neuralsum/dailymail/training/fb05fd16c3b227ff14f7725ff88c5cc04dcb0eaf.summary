by @entity0 for @entity1 if you think you know what a rainbow looks like , think again - this series of amazing images shows the moment upside - down rainbows were spotted in the sky			1
the extremely rare weather phenomenon was seen in the blue sky above @entity12 recently			2
known as circumzenithal arcs , the spectacle occurs when sunlight bounces off ice crystals high in the atmosphere , sending the light rays back up and bending the sunlight into a band of colours			1
web designer @entity22 has spotted a rare instance of circumzenithal arcs , or upside - down rainbows , in the @entity26			1
the photo above shows one of the snaps he took above @entity12			2
the rare phenomenon is usually only seen near the @entity32 poles web designer @entity22 saw the rainbow shining down at him last month and rushed to get his camera to capture the bizarre spectacle			1
rather than being caused by raindrops like normal rainbows , upside - down rainbows are the result of freak atmospheric conditions , rarely seen outside the @entity41			1
meteorologists say the clouds must be convex to the sun , with the ice particles lined up together in the right direction , to refract the light			0
this results in the sunlight bouncing off the ice crystals high in the atmosphere , sending the light rays back up and bending the sunlight like a glass prism into a spectrum of colour			1
the arc is generally only seen in the artic circle - and this is one of just a handful of instances where the arc has been spotted in the @entity26			0
the ' rainbow '' is also much brighter and more concentrated than a rainfall rainbow			0
rainbows are formed when sunlight is refracted in a raindrop			0
but in a circumzenithal arc , the colours are in reverse order from a rainbow , with violet on the top and red at the bottom			0
the arc usually vanishes quickly because the cirrus clouds containing the ice crystals shift their position			1
mr @entity22 , 43 , said : ' i ’ve never seen anything like it before but there it was - directly upwards in the sky from my back garden			2
' it was a very sunny evening , a blue sky with only a few tiny bits of white cloud , but you could n’t miss the rainbow			0
' i was amazed , and my wife and daughter could n’t believe their eyes			0
they thought it was simply wonderful			0
' upside - down rainbows are usually found in the @entity32 @entity41 and are formed when light shines through tiny ice crystals in the clouds			1
the arc only appears when the sunlight catches a specific angle through thin clouds at a heights of around 25,000ft ( 7,600m )			2
because of the altitude , the clouds are made of tiny ice crystals , unlike traditional rainbows that form due to reflection and refraction of light in water droplets			1
and unlike an ordinary rainbow , the sky has to be clear of rain and low level clouds for a circumzenithal arc to be seen			2
the colours in a circumzenithal arc are also in reverse order from a rainbow , with violet on the top and red at the bottom			0
' upside - down rainbows or circumzenithal arcs are an example of a halo , ' @entity127 , a forecaster for the @entity128 , tells @entity1			1
' similar to a rainbow , a halo is formed when light is reflected by ice crystals ( instead of water droplets )			1
' if the light rays strike the ice crystals at a particular angle the light is refracted which gives a slight colouration			2
' the ideal angle is 46 ° and typically only part of the halo forms , appearing like an arc convex to the sun , hence the upside down perspective			0
' the amazing photos show a rainbow that appears to be the wrong way up			1
upside - down rainbows form when sunlight reflects off ice crystals in cloudsat high altitude			1
meteorologists say the clouds must be convex to the sun , with the ice particles lined up together in the right direction , to refract the light the colours in a circumzenithal arc are in reverse order from a regular rainbow ( stock image shown ) , with violet on the top and red at the bottom			2
and unlike a normal rainbow the sky has to be clear of rain and low level clouds for an upside - down rainbow to be seen mr @entity22 ’ spot is one of only a handful of occasions where this phenomenon has been captured in the @entity26			1
he used a @entity182 dslr to capture the extraordinary moment			0
mr @entity22 added : ' it was only there for about five minutes before it started to fade so i rushed inside the house to grab my camera so i could catch it			0
' it was truly unbelievable			0
' a spokesman for the @entity128 added : ' it is quite rare to see an arc as clearly as this in the @entity26			0
visibility of these arcs can vary greatly with someone ten miles away not being able to see it			0

web designer @entity22 spotted the phenomenom above @entity12

upside - down rainbows are *scientifically* known as circumzenithal arcs
they form when sunlight reflects off ice crystals in clouds at high altitude
the incredible spectacle usually only appears near @entity32 or @entity217 poles
