@entity0 is renowned for his enormous vocabulary as well as his introduction of new words to the @entity5 language - but can any modern - day writers compete with his literary skills ? a @entity9 data scientist not only proved that there are indeed contemporary lyricists that can give the playwright a run for his money , he has also discovered that they come from an unexpected source - hip hop			1
by comparing the works of @entity0 with 85 different hip - hop artists , he found 37 - year - old @entity20 rapper @entity19 - who used 7,392 unique words in his first 35,000 lyrics - has a wider vocabulary than the 16th century poet			1
click the image below to explore the interactive graphic earlier this week , @entity9 - based data scientist @entity27 analysed the first 35,000 lyrics of 85 hip - hop and rap artists and compared the number of unique words to those used in the first 35,000 words of @entity0 's plays and @entity38 's @entity37			1
in top spot was @entity19 who used 7,392 unique words , highlighted , while @entity40 sat at the opposite end of the scale with 3,214 unique words 1			1

@entity78 : 5,096 unique words 19			2
@entity80 : 5,090 unique words 20			1
@entity82 : 5,005 unique words by comparison , @entity0 used 5,170 unique words , putting his vocabulary alongside @entity80 and @entity75 , while @entity37 author @entity38 scored 6,022 , only beaten by @entity48 , @entity46 and @entity19			1
‘ literary elites love to rep @entity0 ’s vocabulary : across his entire corpus , he uses 28,829 words , suggesting he knew over 100,000 words and arguably had the largest vocabulary , ever , ' explained @entity27 from @entity93 in @entity9			1
‘ i decided to compare this data point against the most famous artists in hip hop			2
i used each artist ’s first 35,000 lyrics			1
that way , prolific artists , such as @entity95 , could be compared to newer artists , such as @entity103			0
@entity27 analysed the first 5,000 words for seven of @entity0 's works including @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , and @entity112			2
while for @entity38 , he studied the first 35,000 words used in his 1851 novel @entity37			1
all lyrics were taken from website @entity116 , but @entity27 only used lyrics current to 2012			0
as a result , he said this lack of recent data prevented him using a number of more recent artists such as @entity123			0
he also admitted a few other high - profile rappers did n’t have enough official material to be included , for example , @entity127 and @entity128			0
according to @entity27 , 35,000 lyrics is the equivalent of between three and five studios albums , but because not all artists have released that number of tracks , he included mixtapes			1
he then used a methodology called token analysis , also known as lexical analysis which involves using a computer to turn words into tokens that can be analysed and counted			0
as @entity27 explained , each word was counted once , so pimps , pimp , pimping , and pimpin are four unique words			2
to avoid issues with apostrophes , for example , pimpin ’ versus pimpin , @entity27 removed these from the dataset			0
‘ it still is n’t perfect			0
hip hop is full of slang that is hard to transcribe , for example , shorty vs. shawty , featured vocalists , and repetitive choruses			0
’ but he adds it ’s still interesting and reveals a wide range			0
@entity19 was well - above every artist in the dataset , while the presence of @entity57 at number seven , excluding @entity38 , was also significant			1
this is because , as well as being in the top ten as a group , individual members also feature in the top 20 with @entity46 at number two , @entity61 at nine and @entity170 and @entity171 at 19 and 20 respectively			2

while @entity40 , known as @entity40 , pictured right holding the award for @entity186 at the @entity187 in @entity188 , sat at the opposite end of the scale with 3,214 unique words ‘ perhaps their countless hours of studio time together exposed each rapper ’s vocabulary to one another , ’ explained @entity27			1
to further understand each rapper 's vocabulary in @entity57 's first five albums , @entity27 selected a 3,500 - word threshold to put each member was on an equal footing			0
‘ @entity204 and @entity46 clearly bolster the group ’s average , ’ said @entity203			0
' @entity170 and @entity171 ’s contributions have a lower average compared to other members , but recognise that their data points would exceed most artists in hip hop			1
’ @entity57 made the top ten , but individual members also made the top 20			0
@entity46 is at number two , @entity61 is at nine and @entity170 and @entity171 at 19 and 20			0

to explain the group 's large vocabulary , @entity27 said : ' perhaps their countless hours of studio time together exposed each rapper 's vocabulary to one another ' @entity27 also looked at where the rappers were from , to see if there was a vocabulary divide between southern , midwest , west and east coast states			0
the south had the lowest average at 4,268 , while the east - coast , including @entity243 and @entity244 , scored highest with 4,804			0
only four of the 17 southern - based artists in the dataset were above average , including @entity75 , as @entity27 explained : ‘ at 15 , @entity75 ’s deep vocabulary is definitely a function of their style : frequent use of portmanteau , such as @entity254 , @entity255 , southern drawl , including nahmsayin , ery’day , and made - up slang , for example , flawsky - wawsky			1
' my guess is that this is a function of crunk music 's call - and - response style , resulting in more repetition of words			0
