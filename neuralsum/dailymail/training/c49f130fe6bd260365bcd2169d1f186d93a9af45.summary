by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 04:06 est , 20 june 2013 updated : 04:14 est , 20 june 2013 troubleshooters : sir @entity3 , chief inspector of schools , wants to best teachers to go into the worst schools hit squads of top teachers and headteachers should be employed directly by the government and parachuted into failing schools , @entity8 ’s chief inspector said today			1
experienced staff with a proven track record of success could transform children ’s prospects , sir @entity3 believes			1
the trouble shooters would be drawn from @entity20 , which were set up two years ago to train top graduates			0
they would be targeted at areas which have been identified as the worst - performing in the country			0
sir @entity3 said : ' we ’re calling these teachers " national service teachers "			1
these would be a tranche of teachers identified – not newly - qualified teachers , people who are working in schools that we know to be good teachers			2
' we ’re suggesting to government that they contract with government and are then directed to these schools where children are failing , for a period of time , incentivised to do so – financially incentivised to do so – and also then given the chance to move on when they ’ve proved themselves … fast - tracked into leadership positions , ' he told @entity46			1
sir @entity3 has already revealed that a report he is publishing today , @entity47 and @entity48 , will show inner city areas are no longer hotbeds of under - achievement among pupils			1
instead , the problem has shifted to deprived coastal towns and rural areas , as well as ‘ sinking schools ’ , often in areas of relative affluence			2
sir @entity3 added : ' where the problems now are is in schools – good schools , outstanding schools – in county areas , with small proportions of poor children who are doing extremely badly			1
' the worst place that we found for a poor child to be educated in @entity68 is in @entity69 ; not exactly the sort of place you ’d expect			0
' @entity69 is a place where poor children do badly in the primary sector , in the secondary sector , and in post- 16 in rural areas , like @entity77 and @entity78 , in @entity80 and coastal areas , @entity81 and so on			1
we need to think carefully about what we ’re doing to do in these situations			0
' white working - class boys are also the most likely to leave education with few or no decent qualifications now instead of ethnic minorities			0
rural : sir @entity3 said that leafy @entity69 was the worst place for a poor child to be educated in @entity68 in a speech sir @entity3 said : ‘ today , many of the disadvantaged children performing least well in school can be found in leafy suburbs , market towns or seaside resorts			1
often they are spread thinly , as an ‘ invisible minority ’ across areas that are relatively affluent			0
‘ these poor , unseen children can be found in mediocre schools the length and breadth of our country			1
they are labelled , buried in lower sets , consigned as often as not to indifferent teaching			0
‘ they coast through education until - at the earliest opportunity - they sever their ties with it			0
‘ the most important factor in reversing these trends is to attract and incentivise the best people to the leadership of underperforming schools in these areas			2
‘ this may require government to work with @entity20 to identify and incentivise experienced and effective teachers to work in less fashionable , more remote or challenging places			2
the concept of a @entity119 should be considered			0
’ an @entity8 insider last night said details of how the scheme would work had not been drawn up , although the idea is they would be ‘ employed and funded by central government ’			0
it leaves open the prospect of teams of top teachers being sent in to turn around struggling schools or individuals taking long - term placements			2
sir @entity3 has already said the report will recommend a series of regional initiatives that will improve weak areas by focusing on leadership and mentoring by leading schools			1
a @entity144 spokesman said : ‘ we will consider @entity8 ’s recommendations and respond in due course			0

sir @entity3 warns of ' poor , unseen children in mediocre schools '
demands new focus on failure in coastal and *countryside* areas
government should contract the best teachers to parachute into schools
