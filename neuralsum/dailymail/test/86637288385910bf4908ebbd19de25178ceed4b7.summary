president @entity0 will once again stop short of calling the 1915 massacre of @entity2 a genocide , prompting anger and disappointment from those who have been pushing him to use the politically fraught term			1
as a candidate for president in 2008 , @entity0 promised to use the term to describe the mass murder if elected but has not followed through despite calls from the most famous @entity12 , @entity13 , and the @entity14 for the world to recognize the killings as a genocide			1
@entity13 , whose @entity19 heritage comes from her father , the late @entity20 , has used her celebrity since at least 2011 to bring awareness to the genocide			1
she last week traveled to the country for the first time with her husband @entity26 , sister @entity27 and cousins @entity28 and @entity29			1
' an emotional day at the genocide museum , ' read a tweet posted by @entity13 that was accompanied by a photo of her and @entity27 laying flowers at the @entity36 monument ’s eternal flame			2
but the @entity44 still refuses to call the mass killings of ethnic @entity2 a ' genocide ' for fear of offending ally @entity48 @entity50 : historians estimate that 1.5 million @entity2 were killed by @entity43 during @entity52 , @entity2 are made to march in this picture from the 1915 massacre @entity13 , in red , and @entity57 , in blue , walk in the plaza at the @entity59 last week			1
@entity13 and @entity27 were accompanied by their cousins @entity28 and @entity29 and @entity13 's husband @entity26			1
@entity13 and @entity64 's @entity19 heritage comes from their father , the late @entity20 as a senator and presidential candidate , @entity0 did describe the killings of @entity2 as genocide			1
but he has never used that description since taking office , mainly out of deference to @entity48 , a key @entity75 partner			2
top administration officials discussed the decision with @entity19 - @entity75 leaders tuesday			1
the @entity44 said @entity75 officials pledged to @entity19 - @entity75 leaders that the @entity75 would use this week 's 100th anniversary of the killings ' to urge a full , frank and just acknowledgement of the facts , ' but a statement about the meeting did not include the word ' genocide			1
' historians estimate up to 1.5 million @entity2 were killed by @entity43 , an event widely viewed by scholars as a genocide			1
@entity48 , however , denies that the deaths constituted genocide because it was not an ethnic - driven battle and says the death toll has been inflated			2
@entity97 rep. @entity96 said yesterday he was ' deeply disappointed ' by the president 's decision			0
' the @entity75 has long prided itself for being a beacon of human rights , for speaking out against atrocity , for confronting painful chapters of its own past and that of others , ' said @entity96			0
' this can not be squared with a policy of complicity in genocide denial by the president or @entity112			0
' @entity13 and @entity27 laid flowers at the @entity59 genocide monument ’s eternal flame during their visit paying their respects : @entity13 has used her celebrity status to bring awareness to the genocide since at least 2011			2
the @entity14 has also called the slaughter ' the first genocide of the 20th century ' @entity13 and @entity26 are pictured here with daughter @entity125 and @entity27 as they walk inside church hallways to view art prior to baptism in at @entity131			1
james in the historic @entity133 of the @entity134 last year for @entity136 's christening the @entity44 said that while it understands the perspective of those hoping to hear different language from @entity0 this year , the administration believes its approach is right , ' both for acknowledging the past , and for our ability to work with regional partners to save lives in the present			2
' the @entity44 also announced that treasury secretary @entity147 will attend a ceremony in @entity40 friday making the anniversary			1
' president @entity0 's surrender to @entity48 represents a national disgrace , ' @entity151 chairman ( @entity151 ) @entity152 said in a statement yesterday			1
' it is , very simply , a betrayal of truth , a betrayal of trust			0
' the @entity14 added his name last week to the list of high - profile leaders characterizing the 1915 slaughter as the ' first genocide of the @entity166			1
' he further proclaimed that ' concealing or denying evil is like allowing a wound to keep bleeding without bandaging it			0
' @entity13 has been publicly calling for the deaths to be recognized as a genocide since 2011 , when she wrote in a blog post , ' every year , i honor the memory of the martyrs who were killed during the @entity176			2
even though so many countries around the world recognize the @entity36 , the government of @entity48 still denies it			0
' ' it happened before @entity181 , @entity182 , and the @entity183			0
maybe none of those other genocides would have happened if more nations had condemned the @entity187 , when 1.5 million @entity2 were massacred			1
' during their trip last week to her ancestor 's homeland , @entity13 , @entity27 and their cousins met with the country 's prime minister , @entity193 , who ' expressed how proud they are that we are proud @entity2 and we have not forgotten our roots ! ' @entity13 said in a tweet			1
@entity13 's husband @entity26 also threw an impromptu bash and free concert in @entity202 at @entity203 before departing @entity40 for @entity204 , @entity205 - the location of their daughter 's christening at an @entity19 church in 2014			1
the @entity211 also visited the @entity212 during their trip to @entity40 @entity27 wrote in a tweet on the day of their visit to the genocide memorial : ' my sister and i are trying to bring awareness not only to our @entity19 genocide but genocides and human slaughter , in general			1
knowledge is power ! ' she kept the campaign going after she returned home , asking her fan base on @entity230 to sign a @entity232 petition ' to bring awareness to the @entity19 genocide ' by requesting that @entity235 highlight the conflict with its homepage doodle on the anniversary of the killings , april 24			2
' i did ! ! ! ' she said			0
as of wednesday morning the online petition had more than 175,300 supporters and was less than 25,000 signatures away from it 's goal of collecting 200,000 names			0
' the @entity211 have helped strike a powerful blow at @entity48 's campaign of genocide denial , ' @entity151 communications director told @entity249 after the visit			2
their trip to @entity40 ' has helped shine a global spotlight ' on the genocide and ' the need for justice for that crime with millions , ' she said			0
ties that bind : the @entity13 family tree that traces back to two @entity19 families home : @entity13 's ancient ancestors fled the @entity19 village @entity264 ( pictured recently ) to escape a prophecised genocide that did come to pass genocide : the village of @entity268 ( pictured in the @entity269 ) was among hundreds destroyed as the @entity43 laid waste to the region			1
residents - possibly including the @entity211 - can be seen standing by their traditional houses disputed : @entity19 lands ( in red ) were disputed just after the turn of the @entity166 , with bloody consequences @entity2 say up to 1.5 million of their kin were killed between 1915 and 1917 as the @entity43 was falling apart and have long sought to win international recognition of the massacres as genocide			1
@entity48 rejects the claims , arguing that 300,000 to 500,000 @entity2 and as many @entity43 died in civil strife when @entity2 rose up against their @entity43 rulers and sided with invading @entity287 troops			2
the fundamental division was religious			0
@entity2 are @entity289 , while @entity43 are @entity290			2
the two groups had lived alongside each other for hundreds of years , but the @entity43 @entity43 had always been on top			0
as @entity43 rule crumbled , rival nationalisms arose , and the @entity296 - itself to experience revolution in 1917 - also invaded			0
@entity2 say they were forced from their homes , marched to mass graves and slaughtered			0
some managed to flee south into modern - day @entity302 and the @entity304 , others to @entity287 - held land which is now modern - day @entity40			0
hundreds of thousands met a violent end or died as they fled			0
the outcome in terms of mass death is not now widely disputed			0
but the use of the word ' genocide ' is hugely controversial , as turkey - successor to the @entity43 empire , and with a huge majority of @entity290 ethnic @entity43 - rejects the description			2
@entity40 , which became a fully - fledged nation in its modern form at the collapse of the @entity322 , has campaigned for recognition of its description of the deaths			0
its modern borders are much smaller than the areas where the deaths occurred			0
the province of @entity329 ( above ) , where the @entity211 ' roots - and the origin of their name - lies , is almost entirely in @entity48			0
its capital , @entity329 , is now a symbol of the division over the deaths between the two countries : it sits on the border but the frontier is closed .			0

in 1915 , 1.5 million @entity2 were killed by @entity43 in what historians have described as the first genocide of the 20th century
@entity0 refused to call the mass killings a ' genocide ' in official statement despite promising as a presidential candidate that he would
@entity48 officials *furiously* deny there was a genocide , and @entity0 has shied away from offending the close @entity75 ally
@entity13 - who is @entity19 on her father 's side - and the @entity14 have both called the killings a genocide
@entity360 last week traveled to the country for the first time with her husband @entity26 , sister @entity363 and cousins @entity28 and @entity29
the @entity44 will be sending treasury secretary @entity147 to @entity40 this week to mark the 100th anniversary of the killings
