by @entity0 @entity1 : 13:46 est , 21 december 2013 @entity2 : 07:39 est , 23 december 2013 pope @entity3 brought some much - needed @entity5 cheer to sick children today as he continued to ride a wave of popularity - while telling his staff that ' gossip ' was spoiling their service to @entity12			1
the 77 - year - old pontiff walked minutes from his home to bless and kiss smiling youngsters of all colours and creeds at the @entity19 children 's hospital in @entity20			1
his visit , echoing one in 2005 by his predecessor @entity22 , came after the moderniser was named person of the year by @entity26 - which said he had pulled the papacy ' out of the palace and into the streets '			1
after his election in march he washed @entity34 prisoners ' feet , caught shuttle buses with other bishops and called his local newsagent in @entity38 to cancel his delivery when he was elected @entity3			1
he is preparing for his first @entity5 address this week he handed @entity5 packages with an international calling card and a @entity60 metro travel card to 2,000 immigrants living at a shelter			0
but the pontiff 's @entity5 address today to the @entity65 , the 1.2 billion - strong church 's governmental arm , exposed the gossip , infighting and bureaucracy which still dogs the @entity52			2
he said the @entity65 had its ' saints ' but warned staff to be more professional to avoid ' a slow drift downwards toward mediocrity '			1
' when the attitude is no longer one of service to the particular churches and their bishops , the structure of the @entity65 turns into a ponderous , bureaucratic customs house , constantly inspecting and questioning , hindering the working of the @entity83 and the growth of @entity12 's people , ' he said			2
he urged staff to exercise a ' conscientious objection to gossip ' , adding : ' i 'm not simply moralising ! gossip is harmful to people , our work and our surroundings			1
' the @entity3 's star is rising among modernisers after he washed @entity34 prisoners ' feet and rode the bus blessing : photographers captured the moment the pontiff singled out one child in particular at the hospital reform : the @entity3 is tearing up the ageing bureaucracy of the @entity52			1
pictured , former @entity52 secretary of state @entity106 gossip is in no short supply in the @entity52 , where the @entity3 's attempts to overhaul its ageing bureaucracy are fast taking effect			0
the need for change ramped up last year when the secretive , closed world of the @entity52 was exposed as a den of gossip by the leaks of papal documents from the previous @entity3 's butler			1
last week pope @entity3 reshuffled the advisory body of the powerful @entity122 for bishops , the office that vets all the world 's bishop nominations			2
he has already removed the arch - conservative @entity128 cardinal @entity127 , a key figure in the @entity128 culture wars over abortion and gay marriage , and the hard - line head of @entity135 's bishops , cardinal @entity136			0
in the next few weeks he will name his first batch of cardinals and in february will preside over the third summit of his ' @entity141 ' cardinal advisers , who are expected to put forward a first round of plans for revamping the @entity52 bureaucracy			0
two commissions of inquiry , meanwhile , will work on reforming the troubled @entity52 bank and rationalizing the @entity52 's finances			0
four big - name consulting firms - @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152 - have been contracted for various projects			0
the @entity3 has said he wants a @entity154 more responsive to the needs of local bishops , who have long complained of @entity60 's slow or unhelpful interventions in their work			2
he also said he wants the church as a whole to be less consumed with moralising over issues like gay marriage than showing mercy to the needy			0
humility : the @entity3 had previously released a ' home video ' praising the work of recyclers and cleaners			0

@entity172 , 77 , repeated visit to hospital by pope @entity22 in 2005
he has been named @entity178 person of the year for modernising the church
after election in march he washed @entity34 prisoners ' feet and caught buses
but a speech to staff in the @entity154 warned of ' gossip ' and ' mediocrity '
he said *refusal* to deal with real world hindered work of the @entity83
