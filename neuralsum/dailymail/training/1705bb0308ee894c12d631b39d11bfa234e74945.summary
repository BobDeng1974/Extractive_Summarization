climate - changing ? the glaciers in the @entity1 between northern @entity2 and western @entity3 have actually grown , rather than shrinking huge glaciers in the area between @entity2 and @entity3 are puzzling scientists - and disproving the doom - laden predictions of some climate experts			1
the glaciers in the @entity1 between northern @entity2 and western @entity3 have actually grown , rather than shrinking			1
unlike most mountain glaciers , the @entity1 glaciers , which account for 3 percent of the total ice - covered area in the world , excluding @entity14 and @entity15 , are not shrinking			1
a team of @entity19 glaciologists has recently confirmed that these glaciers on average have remained stable or may have even grown slightly in recent years			0
the new study used data from satellites to study the @entity1 of northern @entity2 and western @entity3			1
the researchers found that the ice had actually increased in thickness by 0.11 ( plus or minus 0.22 ) meters per year between 1999 and 2008			1
experts cautioned that the gain is so small that the glaciers might not actually be growing - but what is clear is that the glaciers are not shrinking , according to a report published in @entity34			2
@entity35 , a glaciologist at the @entity36 in @entity19 says , ' not all glacial regions are changing in the same way			0
' a @entity40 study earlier this year using the gravity - sensing grace satellites hinted that ice loss in the high @entity44 mountains might be far less drastic than earlier predictions			2
previous estimates of ice loss in the high @entity44 mountains have ranged up to 50 billion tons a year , according to the @entity49 's professor @entity48			0
previously , it had been claimed by the @entity51 that @entity53 glaciers would have melted to a fifth of current levels by 2035 , leading to sea level rises and drought			0
experts cautioned that the gain is so small that the glaciers might not actually be growing - but what is clear is that the glaciers are not shrinking , according to a report published in @entity34 unlike most mountain glaciers , the @entity1 glaciers , which account for 3 percent of the total ice - covered area in the world , excluding @entity14 and @entity15 , are not shrinking those predictions used ground - based measurements , whereas the new study measured the effect of gravity on twin @entity40 satellites to give an accurate measure of the mass of ice being lost			1
‘ the results in this region really were a surprise , ’ said @entity48			0
‘ one possible explanation is that previous estimates were based on measurements taken primarily from some of the lower , more accessible glaciers in @entity44 and were extrapolated to infer the behavior of higher glaciers			0
' ' but unlike the lower glaciers , many of the high glaciers would still be too cold to lose mass , even in the presence of atmospheric warming			2
’ around the world , melting has been overestimated			0
@entity96 's glaciers and ice caps are shedding roughly 150 billion tons of ice annually - up to 30 per cent lower than predicted			1
the researchers used satellite measurements taken with the @entity101 , or @entity101 , , to calculate that the world 's glaciers and ice caps had lost about 148 billion tons , or about 39 cubic miles of ice annually from 2003 to 2010			2
traditional estimates of @entity96 's ice caps and glaciers have been made using ground - based measurements from relatively few glaciers to infer what all of the unmonitored glaciers around the world were doing , he said			1
only a few hundred of the roughly 200,000 glaciers worldwide have been monitored for a decade or more			0
‘ the strength of @entity101 is that it sees everything in the system , ’ said @entity48			0
‘ even though we do n't have the resolution to look at individual glaciers , @entity101 has proven to be an exceptional tool			0
’ the total does not count the mass from individual glacier and ice caps on the fringes of the @entity14 and @entity15 ice sheets -- roughly an additional 80 billion tons			2
@entity128 melting in a stream of blue water , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 : scientists now believe that glaciers may be melting more slowly than predicted @entity40 's twin grace satellites measured ice loss far more accurately than previous studies , which used ground - based estimates launched in 2002 , two grace satellites whip around @entity96 in tandem 16 times a day at an altitude of about 300 miles , sensing subtle variations in @entity96 's mass and gravitational pull			1
separated by roughly 135 miles , the satellites measure changes in @entity96 's gravity field caused by regional changes in the planet 's mass , including ice sheets , oceans and water stored in the soil and in underground aquifers			1
a positive change in gravity during a satellite approach over @entity14 , for example , tugs the lead grace satellite away from the trailing satellite , speeding it up and increasing the distance between the two			0
a sensitive ranging system allows researchers to measure the distance of the two satellites down to as small as 1 micron - about 1/100 the width of a human hair - and to calculate ice and water amounts from particular regions of interest around the globe using their gravity fields			0
‘ the total amount of ice lost to @entity96 's oceans from 2003 to 2010 would cover the entire @entity180 in about 1 and one - half feet of water , ’ said @entity48 , also a fellow at the @entity177 - headquartered @entity176			2
according to the grace data , total sea level rise from all land - based ice on @entity96 including @entity14 and @entity15 was roughly 1.5 millimeters per year annually or about 12 millimeters , or one - half inch , from 2003 to 2010 , said @entity48 .			1

glaciers between @entity2 and @entity3 have gained mass of ice since 1998
survey using satellite data
area accounts for 3 *%* of ice - covered area on @entity96
gain in thickness between 1999 and 2008
flies in face of predictions of climate activists
