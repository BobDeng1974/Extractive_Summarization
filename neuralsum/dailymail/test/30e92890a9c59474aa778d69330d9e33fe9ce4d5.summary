@entity59 , @entity61 regional policy advisor , said : ' @entity62 are protected by law and people should n't be interfering with badgers or setts			2
' this incident is really unusual and surprising , given the time at which it happened			0
but badgers are pretty headstrong			0
i suspect he was searching for an easy source of food			0
' @entity62 can squeeze through any gaps in fences or hedges which are bigger than 7.5 centimetres			0
so if you have fencing with the slats spaced more narrowly , that will help			0
' even better , people can protect their property through badger - proof fencing			2
this goes a foot or two into the ground so that badgers can not tunnel underneath it			0
' people should also keep the lids on their bins , and if they have a dog or a cat , do n't leave their food or water bowls out in the open			2
' if you do have to make contact with a badger , be sure to wash your hands afterwards			0
