what was meant to be the holiday of a lifetime turned into a nightmare for an @entity5 man when the formerly fit university lecturer was left stranded in a foreign hospital for five weeks after a severe stroke			1
@entity9 and @entity10 were on a holiday in @entity12 in june last year , visiting their daughter @entity13 , her husband , and their grandson , when the sprightly 70 - year - old suffered an unexpected and significant stroke and was rushed to hospital in the capital @entity21			1
the couple had taken out the highest level of travel insurance with @entity25 , and despite being assured on the day of her husband 's stroke that the funding needed to bring him home would be quickly provided , mrs @entity10 was left helplessly begging the insurer for five weeks before any action was taken			1
the holiday of a lifetime turned into a nightmare for an @entity5 man when the formerly fit university lecturer was left stranded in a foreign hospital for five weeks after a severe stroke @entity9 ( right ) and @entity10 were on a holiday in @entity12 in june last year , visiting their daughter @entity13 and their grandson ( left ) , when the sprightly 70 - year - old suffered an unexpected and significant stroke ' the whole experience was terribly traumatic			1
seeing your father have a stroke and nearly die is awful enough , and then to have the company not provide coverage just made everything worse , ' mr @entity44 's daughter , @entity13 told @entity51			1
mr @entity44 had no pre-existing medical conditions , and was extremely fit for his age , riding 35 kilometres to his work on the @entity55 each day			1
the stroke left the mr @entity44 with severe memory loss - to the extent that he could not remember which country he was in - and without the ability to walk			1
mrs @entity10 was initially assigned a case worker , but over the course of five weeks allegedly spoke with at least 18 different staff members with @entity25 , who she claims had not read the case notes before they rang her			1
' it was so upsetting to hear her be asked the same questions over and over , and to have supposedly medically trained staff ask to speak to my father who was very clearly not in a position to communicate , ' ms @entity13 said			0
' every day that they delayed my father declined			0
he lost 18 kilograms while he was in hospital , and every time my mum asked why @entity25 was unable to fly my dad home they came up with an excuse , ' she said			1
the @entity10 's claim that the delay in funding by @entity25 prevented mr @entity44 from receiving the rehab he needed the 70 - year - old ( before the stroke ) was rushed to hospital where he waited five weeks to be sent home ' in emails they blamed ' world events ' and ' time zone differences ' , which made no sense because we were checking them all the time			1
my father was stuck in a foreign country where neither he nor my mum spoke the language which is completely unfair , ' she said			0
a statement from @entity25 said that it was important to highlight that ' what may be interpreted as ‘ taking time ’ to make decisions and get someone home is actually a highly rigorous process that has the safety and well - being of the patient at the forefront of every decision			1
' ' ensuring we take the time to understand the exact situation and impacting factors is paramount to ensuring a safe and secure transit home , ' the statement said			0
mrs @entity10 was informed that @entity25 was waiting on a report from her husband 's neurologist to confirm that he had not had a pre-existing medical condition and that their claim was valid , despite providing medical history to the company when they took out the insurance			1
a customer service representative allegedly told mrs @entity10 that the company was trying to prove that her husband did have a condition , in order to avoid paying the claim			1
' they were legitimate customers , they knew what their age was and did the smart thing and took out proper travel insurance , ' said ms @entity13			0
' in the end he just became a number to them , a projective cost that they did n't want to pay , ' she said			0
mr @entity44 spent five weeks in the @entity140 in @entity12 ( above ) , and lost 18 kilograms mr @entity44 was also not able to start rehabilitation while he was in the @entity12 hospital , as the doctors understood him to be leaving any day to go back to @entity5 ' when we are informed that one our customers requires medical treatment we ensure that we are obtaining medical information from the treating medical team overseas			1
coinciding with this we also request a medical report from our insured ’s gp in @entity5 , ' the statement from @entity25 said			2
' this allows us to have a view of any current or previous medical history our insured may have , understand whether there are any existing medical conditions we need to be mindful of when looking at repatriation options and to assess whether the claim falls within the insured ’s travel cover , ' ' in some instances , as was the case with the @entity10 family , the information provided by the @entity151 may lead to further questions or require further clarification from other involved medical professionals			2
in this case we ensure we speak to all appropriate medical specialists to understand exactly what the medical history of the insured is			0
' ms @entity13 said that the way her father was treated was very clinical and claimed that the company has lost touch with the fact that it deals primarily with people in need			0
' obviously what they forgot is that he is a father , a grandfather , and a husband , and that every minute of every day he was declining , ' she said			0
mr @entity44 was also not able to start rehabilitation while he was in the @entity12 hospital , as the doctors understood him to be leaving any day to go back to @entity5			1
ms @entity13 said that despite doctors at the @entity12 hospital recommending that mr @entity44 be flown back to @entity5 lying down with trained medical nurses to accompany him , @entity25 asked for a family member to fly with him			1
mr @entity44 's daughter said that @entity25 did not provide an ambulance to transport mr @entity44 to the airport mr @entity44 with his grandson before the stroke , which left him unable to walk and significant memory problems she said that the chief medical officer of @entity25 directly denied the recommendations of the hospital , which her family believes was due to the high cost of contacting the nurses			1
' my father had to be put on antidepressants , and by the time he left his dosage had doubled			0
i can not emphasize enough the emotional impact this had on my whole family , ' ms @entity13 said			0
' in the end after hearing my mum talk to the 18th person i decided to get on @entity213 and complain publicly and ask them what the hell they were doing , ' she said			0
' within two hours i had been contacted by @entity25 and the funding to send my father back to @entity5 was all approved			1
it took a public threat to make them take action , which just goes to show what kind of company they are			0
' mr @entity44 's daughter said that @entity25 did not provide an ambulance to transport mr @entity44 to the airport , and had never been contacted by the company 's local agent , who was meant to be organising all the paperwork on the ground			1
' it was my mother and i who were standing at hospital photocopy and fax machines trying to get everything sorted			0
we were just left on our own , ' ms @entity13 said			0
' where a stretcher repatriation with 2 medical escorts is deemed the safest form of travel ( as was the case with the @entity243 ) , we must speak to airline providers to understand the availability for the transfer home – peak travel periods can make this difficult as stretcher repatriations require up to 10 economy class seats for the patient and the medical escorts , ' the statement from @entity25 said			2
mr @entity44 ( above left , with his wife ) had no pre-existing medical conditions , and was extremely fit for his age , riding 35 kilometres to his work on the @entity55 each day ms @entity13 said that her mother ( left ) has never received any follow up on the incident , despite sending multiple emails , and has been left quite traumatised by the whole experience ' @entity261 can take up to 7 days to clear a patient for travel as it requires their medical team being happy with the information as well as clearance from the engineering team			1
if the airline requires further medical information from the treating hospital , this can add to the time it takes to get clearance			0
' ms @entity13 said her father 's rehabilitation has been significantly delayed due to the amount of time it took to bring him back to @entity5 , and that he is still not able to walk up stairs and has no feeling in his left hand			2
' his mental health deteriorated in the period he was there , he thought he was in @entity286 and kept saying how long it had been since i 'd seen him when i 'd visited only a few hours ago , ' ms @entity13 said			0
' we are talking about a smart , fit , @entity5 man who taught it at university , whose hard - earned money went to insurance coverage , ' she said			2
' we were n't trying to wrought them ; we just wanted to bring him home			0
now he needs a full - time carer and we are dealing with the effects of the stroke on a day to day basis			2
' ms @entity13 said that her mother has never received any follow up on the incident , despite sending multiple emails , and has been left quite traumatised by the whole experience			0
' it affects us every single day - emotionally , physically , and mentally			0
for us to even hear the name @entity25 brings up terrible images of my dad withering away in the hospital , ' ms @entity13 said , ' it was terrible and unnecessary and there was a complete lack of reality behind it all , ' she said			2
' you can vote with your dollar , and until people in ivory towers start to treat customers like people and not like numbers this wo n't get better			0
' ' we are glad that the @entity10 family has returned home safely and that we were able to cover approximately $ 90,000 aud in costs to repatriate @entity9 home			2
repatriations are very complex and require the safety of the patient to be at the forefront of every decision , ' the statement from @entity25 said			2
' it is vital that the right information is received , which can at times be difficult , particularly in countries where the language and medical treatment may differ from what is standard in @entity5			2
