‘ maybe he was pushing it a bit			0
i was delighted , of course			0
’ @entity26 @entity107 , 2005 to 2007 ‘ he had been constantly frustrated at his inability to persuade any health ministers anywhere that [ complementary medicine ] was a good idea , and so he , as he once described it to me , found me unique from this point of view , in being somebody that actually agreed with him on this , and might want to deliver it			1

’ @entity291 majorprime minister 1990 to 1997 ‘ i think it is encouraging that the @entity1 is entirely free from his unique perspective to write to ministers or the prime minister in a way that is invariably intended to be helpful , and i think to cut that off , or to make sure those letters are much more bland than they otherwise might be , would be a loss			1
