@entity0 and 23 other states trying to block president @entity3 's recently announced immigration orders are holding up the costs of providing unemployment insurance , education , health care , driver 's licenses and other programs to illegals as evidence that the directives will cause them ' irreparable damage ' if allowed to take effect			1
the states made the case in a filing submitted to a @entity0 court ahead of a hearing on thursday at which they hope to obtain a preliminary injunction barring the @entity3 administration from proceeding with its plans to give more than 4 million illegal immigrants work permits			1
@entity29 is also claiming that illegal immigrants residing in @entity29 will be able to get concealed carry permits as a result of @entity3 's unilateral action			1
states say that president @entity3 's immigration directives will cost untold millions , and they are trying to get them blocked through the courts ' @entity38 will have to pay millions of dollars to remediate the problems created by the @entity40 , ' the brief states			1
' it will be difficult or impossible to recover those costs from the federal government			1
' driver 's licenses alone will cost millions , states participating in the legal challenge argued			2
using @entity0 ' population of 1.6 million illegal immigrants as an example , the brief claims that the state would face a net loss of $ 174.73 per license if a third of its immigrant population sought ids			2
if just two percent applied , it would still cost @entity0 taxpayers close to $ 131 per license			0
in just the last two years @entity0 says it has spent $ 1.313 billion on administering medical care to illegal immigrants and $ 303 million in @entity63 money			2
the costs of educating illegal immigrant children in @entity0 are nearly $ 9,500 a pupil , annually , the briefing asserted			0
' @entity0 is not unique , ' it goes on to explain			0
also listed as plaintiffs in the @entity0 suit are : @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity29			0
separately , @entity29 is claiming that @entity3 's executive order will allow otherwise qualified illegal immigrants to apply for concealed carry permits for handguns			1
' the cost to the state are immense , ' @entity29 's then - attorney general , @entity97 , said last month during an appearance on @entity103 host @entity102 's show			2
' we have certain things that under this law we have from provide to these four to five million national illegal immigrants such as drivers licenses , they will get @entity110 , the ability to get work permits , they will get unemployment benefits , ' he claimed			2
in addition , @entity97 , who exited office last week , said , ' very importantly in @entity29 , where we have permits for concealed carry of firearms , they are going to be able to lawfully carry firearms when they are not even lawfully in the country			1
' a spokeswoman for the ag 's office confirmed to @entity126 at the time of the appearance that illegal immigrants who meet the requirements for concealed carry will be able to apply for permits in @entity29			1
. but one of the documents applicants must provide is a proper license for the gun , and an undated copy of @entity140 guidelines once posted to the agency 's website and obtained by @entity143 states that its a crime for illegal residents to have guns , let alone purchase them			1
@entity140 has not returned @entity143 's requests for confirmation that the policies outlined in the document are still in effect			0
however , @entity154 founder and firearms expert @entity152 told @entity143 that illegal immigrants are still barred from buying or owning guns in the @entity156 , contrary to @entity29 's claims			1
former @entity29 attorney general @entity97 , left , shakes hands with newly inaugurated attorney general @entity159 at the state @entity160 on monday , jan. 5 , in @entity161 , @entity29			0
@entity97 has argued that illegal immigrants will be eligible for concealed carry permits under @entity29 law but that may not be true the president announced his immigration measures in late november , but they will not take effect until this spring , giving @entity169 politicians at both the state and federal levels ample time to challenge the directives before the @entity174 begins issuing work permits			1
in addition to the state - based strategy to undo the immigration orders , lawmakers opposed to @entity3 's executive actions are looking to link appropriations for the @entity174 through the end of the fiscal year to legislation barring funds from being spent on immigration services they believe are unlawful			1
@entity189 passed , and the president signed , a large spending bill in december that allotted money to every area of the government but @entity174 through the end of september			0
appropriations for the department will run out on feb. 28 unless @entity189 acts			0
the @entity197 is considering legislation this week that would effectively cut off funding for @entity3 's directives and stop @entity174 agencies from spending the money they collect from fees on those immigration services while approving the bulk of the department 's budget			2
the @entity208 said monday that it would veto any legislation that tampers with the president 's executive order			0
' there 's never a good time for @entity169 to do something like this , but right now it seems like a particularly bad time to do so , ' the president 's spokesman said			0
if the @entity208 and @entity169 ca n't agree on a compromise before the end of next month , @entity174 will go into a partial shutdown and non-essential staffers will be put on unpaid leave until the the legislative and executive branches resolve the situation			0
@entity197 and @entity229 @entity169 leaders have said they wo n't let that happen , though .			0

' @entity38 will have to pay millions of dollars to remediate the problems created by the @entity40 , ' a court filing states
