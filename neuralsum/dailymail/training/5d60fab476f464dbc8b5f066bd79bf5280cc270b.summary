judge @entity16 directed @entity17 , which is behind @entity1 , to pay out £ 100,000 as an interim payment			1
gleeful : @entity20 , 45 , registered the name for his chain of comedy clubs as a trademark in the @entity4 in 1999 - ten years before the @entity2 musical show first aired in @entity4 on @entity25 but the order will have to get the backing of the @entity28 before it can be fully enforced			1
@entity20 registered the name ‘ @entity12 ’ as a @entity4 trademark in 1999 under @entity31 , some 10 years before the tv show arrived			2

teen musical : mr @entity20 argued customers were being put off attending @entity12 because people associated them with the teen musical drama senior executives from @entity44 's @entity17 were flown in to contest the claims , saying they had no prior knowledge that the comedy clubs or their trademark existed			1
