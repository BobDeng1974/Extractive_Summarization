with their moody murder mysteries , flatpacked furniture , and minimalistic designs , you may be fooled into thinking that @entity6 @entity5 is a modest affair			1
however , when it comes to celebrating the holidays , the @entity6 tend to go for more is more - at least in the food and drinks department			2
the @entity6 celebrate @entity5 on @entity10 instead of @entity5 , and as one of the most secular countries in the world , the festivities are rarely about the birth of @entity16			1
this is just the starter : a small version of a traditional @entity6 @entity19 - a smorgasbord enjoyed across the country on @entity10 the food @entity6 people take their @entity5 - time eating very seriously , and most families serve the traditional @entity25 ( @entity26 ) – a winter - season smorgasbord			1
to most @entity6 , the idea of only having one kind of meat for @entity5 dinner is absurd			1
@entity25 is eaten in ‘ rounds ’ , requiring several visits to the smorgasbord to refill the plate			0
traditionally , the rounds are ; herring , salmon and cold meats , entrees , and dessert ( if there is still space )			2
as well as the inevitable different types of pickled herring to start , the most common dishes include @entity5 roast ham , @entity5 sausages , meatballs ( obviously ) , pork ribs , gravadlax , smoked salmon , beetroot salad , cheeses , and @entity55 's @entity54 - a casserole dish made of potatoes , pickled sprats and cream			1
the @entity25 differs somewhat between north and south , and families hailing from the farming lowlands of @entity62 often serve geese , duck and eel , while those from the colder latitudes go for reindeer , deer and cloudberry jam			2
one thing is consistent throughout the land – there is lots of it			0
pickled fish and shots : a proper @entity25 will have at least three different types of herring and shots of frozen aquavit is served in constantly refilled long - stemmed shotglasses the drink drinking during @entity5 is considered an artform among @entity6			1
@entity84 , a @entity86 version of mulled wine is drunk steaming hot with raisins and almonds at any time during the @entity5 period , but the real deal starts with the first @entity25 round on @entity10			0
@entity93 is a spirit flavoured with botanicals and herbs , one of which must be dill or caraway , which tends to have an @entity101 of 35 - 40 per cent			0
many @entity6 have a selection of different aquavits ready in the freezer ahead of the @entity25			0
the aquavit is served frozen in long - stemmed shotglasses and works both as a palate cleanser and digestif during the @entity25 , which sometimes involves several hours of eating			0
traditionally , someone around the table suggests a toast , which sees the entire table burst into a song known as ‘ snapsvisa ’ – a short and often humours chanson describing how much the table is going to enjoy drinking the aquavit			0
when the song is over , the aquavit is ' taken ' , like a shot			0
the entertainment the @entity6 have a slightly odd tradition of religiously watching the same 1950s @entity123 cartoons over and over again			1
to a @entity6 , there is nothing that says @entity5 like @entity126			1
at 3pm sharp on @entity10 , @entity128 - the @entity6 @entity131 - broadcasts ' @entity129 ' ( @entity126 and his friends wish you a @entity5 )			1
this is a 1958 @entity133 special called @entity129 , where @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity126 presents about a dozen animated shorts and clips from @entity123 films from the 30s - 60s			2
millions of @entity6 sit down at 3pm and watch the exact same shows year after year ( it has been broadcast since 1959 )			1
@entity142 forbid you would record it or mix things up			0
for a progressive country they sure hate change : @entity123 's @entity148 has been shown on @entity6 television at 3pm on christmas eve since 1959 - millions still watch every year and what would a good old social democrat @entity5 be without @entity152 's @entity10 , a 1975 animated short - film set during the @entity153			1
it tells the @entity155 - like story of 14 - year - old @entity152 who works in a post office and steals @entity5 presents addressed to rich people in order to give them to the poor			2
at 7pm , the @entity6 gather in front of the television set and try to forget that 13 per cent of them voted for a right - wing anti-immigrant party in the last general election			0
the @entity6 do not open their @entity5 presents at dawn , but instead keep all gifts under the tree which are then handed from giver to recipient in a present ceremony at some point during the day ( normally between the @entity25 and @entity152 )			1
like his distant relative @entity175 , the @entity174 holds and annual @entity176 , but not until christmas day when most @entity6 are still recovering from food coma			2
. although the @entity180 have much in common when it comes to christmas eve traditions , the foods differ somewhat			0
in @entity184 , families stay away from the gluttony of its neighbours , serving @entity188 with sugar - fried potatoes and gravy , accompanied by wine			0
however , this is only a respite from the snaps and smorgasbord , as the @entity184 enjoy @entity195 ( @entity196 , similar to the @entity25 ) throughout december , and on @entity5 and @entity197			0
the @entity198 generally , also have a ‘ smorgasbord - free ’ @entity10 , but still serve multiple entrees during dinner , such as lamb - ribs , deer , turkey and fish			0
the @entity205 do not stray far from the @entity6 when it comes to food ( and drink ) , but there can be no @entity5 in the @entity205 homes before the @entity5 sauna .			1

@entity6 @entity5 traditions involve copious amounts of food and drink
most families serve several types of meat , pickled herring and salmon
each course is accompanied by at least one shot of aquavit
every year @entity6 watch the same 1950s @entity123 @entity5 special
