' @entity57 , in these tough economic times , has to find a way to balance their budget			2
they 've got to make choices , ' mr @entity2 said			2
' they expect @entity13 to live within its means and to make choices as well and it 's time for the president and @entity68 @entity51 to get serious about the long - term spending problem that we have			1

it 's a very natural human emotion			0

it 's a job he 's got to do , and it 's a job only the president can do			2
