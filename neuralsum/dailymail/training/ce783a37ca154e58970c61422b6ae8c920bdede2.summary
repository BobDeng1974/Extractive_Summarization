@entity0 , @entity1 by @entity2 one day in june 1969 , a young couple from @entity5 took the train to @entity7 where they had been offered a council house			1
seeing two policemen , they asked if they could direct them to the @entity14 estate			2
‘ we should do , we have to go there often enough , ’ replied one			2
his colleague added he would not live there ‘ for all the tea in @entity21			2
’ when the pair finally found the house , passing huge ‘ @entity27 ’ grafitti , their two - bedroom property had boarded - up windows and an overgrown garden			2
the second volume of @entity32 politician @entity2 's memoir follows him from teenage postman married to a single mother four years his senior through to national union official it was an inauspicious start to married life			1
but for @entity2 , raised in grinding poverty , it was an offer he grasped with gratitude			1
‘ we would make the @entity14 estate our home , ’ he writes			2
‘ life there was good			2
’ he recalled how his mother spent her life in barely habitable slums , dreaming of the day she had her own front door — only to be finally offered a council house two weeks after her early death , when he was just 13			1
the estate provides a backdrop for the second volume of the @entity32 politician ’s memoirs , in which he goes from teenage postman married to a single mother four years his senior through to national union official — and marital separation — two decades later			1
a young @entity2 when he was general secretary of the @entity64 like his acclaimed first volume this boy , this is named after a @entity69 song and beautifully written , a series of affectionate anecdotes and vividly observed sketches that conjure up a recent age slipped into the past			1
this time it is the @entity76 and early @entity77 , working in a public service barely changed over the previous century			2
postmen — and they were all men when he started — wore traditional uniforms , were often ex-forces and central figures in their communities			0
he and his colleagues fed cats for owners on holiday , delivered magazines after surreptitiously reading them first and ate hearty breakfasts at farms during their round			0
meanwhile , they relied heavily on overtime and @entity95 practices to boost pay packets			0
this is another elegiac slice of social history , conjuring up the days when drink driving was rife , postal workers saw the fax machine as a threat to their future and drivers had to ‘ double declutch ’ their clunky vans			0
so different were society ’s attitudes the young couple gave a false wedding date to their new neighbours since his wife ‘ did n’t want anyone to know that she had been pregnant when we married ’			1
abandoning ambitions of pop stardom after his guitar is stolen , the author educates himself by listening to the radio and reading — including a quality newspaper he hides at work ‘ as if it were a pornographic magazine ’			0
for all its easy charm , this is a less compelling saga than @entity2 ’s story of his tough childhood in post-war @entity5 slums			1
there is too much detail of postal shift patterns and rather dreary union politics			1
yet please , mr @entity133 is still a first - class delivery , head and shoulders above most political memoirs with its self - deprecating style			0
‘ they dressed scruffy but talked posh			0
we dressed posh but talked scruffy , ’ he says on meeting some middle - class militants			0
he writes movingly about being raised in poverty by far the most moving chapter is about his sister ’s husband @entity146 — ‘ the kindest , gentlest , most decent man i ’d ever known ’ — who was a secret alcoholic , and killed himself in the basement of the shop where he worked			0
@entity2 idolised his brother - in - law , who arrived in his life shortly before his mother ’s death			1
‘ the tears i found it so hard to shed when my mother died have poured down my face a hundred times for @entity146 and for the awful , tragic end to his short life			1
’ it is indeed a tragic tale with @entity146 ’s drinking — stashes of vodka hidden in the garage and garden shed — spiralling out of control amid worries over his job			0
then @entity2 ’s beloved and big - hearted sister crumbles into delayed depression during a summer holiday in @entity178 and he is needed to support the sister who for so long supported him			1
then there is the subtle way this ‘ militant moderate ’ handles his political awakening			0
he admits to having no idea when he became interested in politics , yet his evolution emerges in a series of revelatory vignettes			0
these begin with a snooker - playing colleague who worked during a strike and was sent to @entity193			0
‘ in the canteen he would rise from the breakfast table hopefully , snooker cue in hand , but nobody would play against him			0
’ after five months @entity2 left , during which no one ever spoke to this poor man			1
‘ for all i know his isolation lasted until his retirement , ’ he writes			0
‘ i colluded in trying to break a man ’s spirit and it ’s something i ’ve been ashamed of ever since			0
’ he watched as @entity32 politics turned nasty amid the hard - left takeover , saw through the posturing of @entity210 , rejects the chance to buy his council house and uses a telephone on the desk of his union ’s general secretary to symbolise the @entity218 new order			1
his predecessor showed him this special white phone and said it was a hotline for ministers and senior civil servants seeking the general secretary ’s opinion on crucial affairs of state			0
but during this beleaguered union baron ’s decade at the helm , the phone only rang once			2
‘ the caller had been a woman asking if this was @entity233 ’s			0
’ @entity2 with now leader of the @entity32 @entity235 at a press conference in @entity237			1
@entity2 writes about having seen through the posturing of certain politicians such as @entity210 during his long and varied career			1
the memoir ends with @entity2 parting from his wife and driving away from @entity14 after 19 years ‘ keeping my eyes firmly fixed on the road ahead ’ .			1

this is the second volume of @entity32 politician @entity2 's memoir
it follows him from teenage postman married to a single mother
by the end he had risen to become anational union official
