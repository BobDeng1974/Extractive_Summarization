by @entity0 published : 05:14 est , 30 october 2012 updated : 06:44 est , 30 october 2012 a new era for mobile phone use begins today as superfast @entity4 products and services are made available to millions of consumers in 11 cities across the @entity8			1
claiming to offer speeds five times faster than current networks , it is billed as a ' landmark day ' for @entity8			1
however , experts have hit out at the pricing , and warned consumers to wait			0
@entity8 's first @entity16 , run by @entity17 , launches today - but has come under fire for its high prices costly : @entity17 has come under fire for its high pricing , with experts advising consumers to wait for rival networks to launch @entity17 , formerly known as @entity17 , launch its range of @entity4 products and services today in @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38			1
the launch comes amid criticism of @entity17 ’s @entity4 pricing plans , which will hit customers on certain tariffs with additional charges if they exceed download allowances			2
consumers will have to switch their mobile contract to @entity17 to use the new network			1
the cheapest @entity17 tariff offers just 500mb worth of downloads each month - the equivalent to two one - hour programmes on the @entity54			1
customers who want to download more than their 500mb allowance will have to pay extra , with a user looking to download eight one - hour programmes a month facing additional charges of up to £ 180 a year			0
the @entity17 deals range from £ 36 a month for 500mb of data downloads to £ 56 a month for @entity62 of data			1
the @entity64 , which offers speeds up to five times faster than @entity67 , will be available on the @entity68 as well as devices from @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73			1
there are no plans for unlimited data downloads , leading experts to warn consumers to wait			1
' very few consumers should buy a @entity4 contract from day one , ' said @entity81 of @entity82			0
' the service only works in eleven cities today ( although many more will follow quickly ) , and it 's very expensive to use			2
' come back in a year or two though , and many more of us will be on @entity4 , so if you 're buying a top - end phone , make sure it will work with all the 4g networks that will launch in the @entity8			2
' for example , @entity90 's @entity68 will only work with one or two @entity8 4g networks in the future , whereas the @entity94 or @entity95 will work with all of them			2
however , @entity81 admits the service is a big step forward			0
' if you do n't do your research , you could get caught out once your contract comes to an end and you want to use the phone you paid so much for on a different network			0
' ' today is massive for @entity8 tech - @entity8 's first @entity4 phone network launches			2
' this is an incredibly important milestone in our race to compete with the rest of the world as several other countries already have @entity4			0
@entity17 customers in a further five cities - @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 - will have access to @entity4 by the end of the year			1
the group then plans to roll out the service to further towns , cities and rural areas next year , with population coverage of 70 % and rising to 98 % in 2014			0
rival operators including @entity127 , @entity130 owner @entity128 and @entity131 will be able to launch their own 4g services and products from next spring			0
the companies had threatened legal action against communications regulator @entity136 over its @entity4 auction process , which has allowed @entity17 to be the sole @entity8 provider of the superfast services until next year			2
@entity127 launched a ' @entity4 phone promise ' last week , offering customers the chance to bring an eligible phone into any store and have 70 % knocked off their remaining contract , in exchange for taking on a 4g device			0
@entity17 , ceo at @entity17 , said : ' today is a landmark day for our company , the @entity8 mobile industry and , most importantly , the country ’s businesses and consumers			1
' but this is just the start as our 4g network will continue to grow stronger and wider by the day			0
' we ’re investing £ 1.5 billion in our network to be the first company to offer mobile 4g in the @entity8 , alongside the biggest 3g network			0
' @entity17 , ceo of @entity17 says today is a ' landmark day ' for the firm as it launches @entity8 's first @entity4 network @entity163 , telecoms expert at @entity164 , said : ' the @entity4 rollout is a game changer for the mobile market			1
but the launch of the service on a single network , @entity17 , has already stirred up problems for mobile users when it comes to choosing whether or not to make the leap to super-fast mobile internet or stay put with their current providers			1
' as expected , rival networks have waged war on @entity17 in a heated bid to hang onto existing customers , promising discounted mid-contract upgrades to @entity4 phones in the future , as an alternative to switching to @entity17 right now			1
' the first spanner in the works for mobile fans was @entity127 's ad campaign ’s claim : " not all 4g networks are the same , " ' citing that their eventual roll - out will provide better indoor coverage than that of @entity17			2
the second is the realisation that handsets touted as ' 4g - ready ' could well cause confusion , with different networks using different spectrums to provide the service			0
' our research shows that as many as 45 % of @entity203 think they do n't need @entity4 and 29 % do n't even know what it is			0
if the mobile giants want to win customers , they need to make things as jargon - free and transparent to the average consumer as possible – or risk causing even more confusion			0
