by @entity0 a humpback whale that had been tangled in rope was spotted while swimming just off the coast of @entity5 's @entity4 on saturday			1
the mighty animal appeared to have the right side of his tail caught in an orange rope when it was sighted by @entity11 at around 3pm			1
' the rope is most likely from some fishing gear			2
generally they get trapped in fish traps or crab traps that are dropped along the coast and are usually around 30 metres long with a cage at the end , but sometimes they may have picked up a drift net , ' @entity11 @entity5 's manager @entity14 told the @entity23			1
a humpback whale was spotted tangled in an orange rope while swimming just off the coast of @entity5 's @entity4 on saturday it was sighted by @entity11 at around 3pm but the group reported that it was ' swimming along fine and did n't seem to be in any stress ' ' you can see that the rope is sort of going straight down and its taught , which means it has got a fair bit of gear underneath that it 's towing along			1
if it was just a rope , it would be trailing along , not dragging down			0
' the tour group reported however , that the animal was ' swimming along fine and did n't seem to be in any stress ' when it was first seen			0
nevertheless , two of the group 's boats stayed alongside the whale while they waited for @entity49 to arrive with disentanglement gear and assess the situation			2
a spokeswoman for @entity11 told the @entity23 that by the time @entity53 arrived it was already too dark for them to assess and free the whale			1
a spokeswoman for @entity11 told the @entity23 that by the time @entity49 and @entity57 arrived it was already too dark for them to assess and free the whale an @entity61 spokesperson assured that spotters had been placed from the @entity63 to @entity64 as of sunday morning in an attempt to relocate the tangled mammal an @entity61 spokesperson confirmed that the rescue teams lost sight of the whale , but assured that spotters had been placed from the @entity63 to @entity64 as of sunday morning in an attempt to relocate the tangled mammal			1
it 's been a sad migration season for whales across @entity76 with at least three entanglements off the coast of @entity5 as well as one in the north coast where a beaching also occurred			0
mr @entity14 said that the increase in entanglements is not necessarily due to an increase in debree , but could instead be due to the rise in whale populations , leading to a rise in the number of the animals who head to warmer waters along the eastern coast fromm may to mid august each year			2
' this year there are over 20,00 humpbacks traveling along the coast and in the past there were only 8,000 , ' mr @entity14 said			0
' the numbers have increased , so now you 're seeing more incidents of them being beached and entangled , not particularly because there 's more fishing gear but because there 's more whales coming so close to the coast - but it is a problem			0
' another humpback whale was stranded on a sand bank at the @entity110 earlier in the week , but finally managed to swim its way to freedom two days later despite freezing temperatures and the potential danger , the spectators decided to take matters into their own hands by using their combined weight to move the eight - metre mammal as light was fading mr @entity14 said that @entity121 had begun researching the effectiveness of using ' pingers ' on shark nets to ward off sea creatures including whales and thus prevent them from becoming entangled in the rope			2
however funding for the project , under the @entity129 , was cut by the @entity131 government this year			0
