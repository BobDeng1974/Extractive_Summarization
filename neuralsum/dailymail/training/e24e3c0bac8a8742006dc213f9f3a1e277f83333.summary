by @entity0 published : 03:30 est , 14 january 2013 updated : 04:56 est , 14 january 2013 a brain - boosting milkshake that is said to reduce symptoms of early @entity4 has gone on sale in the @entity6 today			1
the drink contains a mix of ‘ memory boosting ’ nutrients including those found in breast milk and herring			0
the ‘ medical food ’ comes after a decade of research into a formula food that might improve the brain function of people in the early stages of the disease			1
it contains omega 3 fatty acids , the nutrient found in fish which is known to be good for the brain , with a daily dose equivalent to eating three or four herrings			0
the drink also contains two other compounds normally present in the blood - uridine , which is produced by the liver and kidneys and found in breast milk , and choline found in meat , nuts and eggs - b vitamins and other nutrients			0
it will be available over-the - counter in pharmacies and online at £ 3.49 for a daily dose - adding up to almost £ 1,300 a year - and consumers have to confirm they have consulted a doctor or other health professional			0
studies originally carried out by researchers at @entity55 suggest it helps improve memory performance after six months in people with mild @entity4 who are not taking drugs			1
however , a study on people with moderate @entity4 ’s who were on prescribed medication found no improvement			1
the @entity64 has warned the milkshake ' is a lot less effective than current drugs available for people in the early stages of dementia ' some have welcomed @entity23 for providing a new dietary aid to improve the health of early @entity4 ’s patients , but critics warned it was an expensive option that was less effective than drugs			1
around 800,000 people in the @entity6 live with dementia , of which @entity4 ’s disease is the most common form			1
the loss of connections in the brain called synapses which help relay information is one of the key features of early @entity4			1
the three main compounds in @entity23 are needed by brain nerve cells to make phospholipids , the primary component of cell membranes that form synapses			1
dr @entity95 , consultant in @entity96 , said ‘ alzheimer ’s disease is not part and parcel of aging but a serious and progressive disease of the brain which prevents us from being able to retain new memories			0
‘ as we age , our bodies become less efficient at processing essential nutrients , meaning that we need to increase our intake of food to absorb the same amount of nutrients in order to maintain a healthy body			0
in the same way , we need the right nutrients for our brains to keep them healthy			0
‘ @entity4 sufferers often find it very difficult to get everything they need through diet alone and the nutritional intervention by the use of @entity23 is a new area of research offering promising results for the management of early alzheimer ’s disease			1
’ products marketed as food for special medical purposes do not have to go through the same @entity132 regulatory process as drugs			0
but they have to prove they are ‘ safe and beneficial and effective in meeting the particular nutritional requirements of the persons for whom they are intended ’ and must be taken under medical supervision			0
people buying @entity23 , which comes in two flavours vanilla and strawberry , are being urged to speak with a doctor , specialist nurse , dietitian or pharmacist first			1
professor @entity146 , director of research at the @entity64 charity , said ‘ people should n’t get excited that an off - the - shelf drink is going to transform the lives of people with dementia			2
‘ while past studies of this product have showed some benefits for memory , there is no evidence that it has an effect on other aspects of thinking or everyday life and there was also no benefit on other symptoms of dementia			2
‘ this is likely to cost about £ 1000 a year and is a lot less effective than current drugs available for people in the early stages of dementia			1
‘ for many older people with dementia where finances might be tight , people are probably much better off putting their money towards good quality care or taking part in exercise			2
‘ one in three people over 65 will develop dementia			2
it ’s vital we continue to fund research into new treatments to enable people to live well with the condition			0
’ @entity185 , chief executive of dementia @entity6 charity , said ‘ a diagnosis of dementia is devastating both for those with the condition and their families and carers			0
‘ early stage intervention is important for maximising choices and enabling people with dementia and their carers to lead healthier lives for longer			2
’ @entity23 is made by @entity198 , the medical foods division of @entity200 .			0

makers of @entity23 claim it reduces symptoms of early @entity4 's
@entity205 said to boost levels of nutrients necessary for building synapses
but experts say it is a lot less effective than current drugs available for people in early stages of dementia
