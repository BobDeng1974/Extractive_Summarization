@entity15 , based at the @entity4 , used an image of a female student alone in the dark with the caption : ' someone will lose their friends ' to sell tickets for its party in the @entity26 event in june			1
critics said it suggested young women attending the event would be ' fair game '			1
the @entity31 has called the poster ' disgusting ' and it led to a campaign by students to have it removed from the @entity36 campus			2
it has also emerged that the photo used was from last year 's ball and put on the poster without the young woman 's permission			2
the former student , named only as @entity42 , tweeted after seeing the poster : ' @ @entity44 clearly i 'm fair game without those pesky protective friends			1
love from : girl in the photo '			0
student @entity50 , 20 , who is women 's campaign officer for the @entity15 said : ' when i first saw it , i was disgusted			1
i think it 's really harrowing for women students in particular who may have been attacked or had a bad experience on campus			2
' a lot of students , both male and female , find it quite disturbing			0
the picture was also used without the consent of the girl featured			0
it only shows her body , which objectifies her			0
