by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity3 mayor @entity2 dropped the f - bomb during a speech at the city 's @entity6 monday night as he congratulated the @entity8 for their @entity10 win			1
having shed his pinstriped suit of choice for a hockey jersey monday , @entity2 stepped in front of the tv cameras and a full house at the stadium , and declared it a big day for @entity3			1
' there are two rules in politics , ' @entity2 told those celebrating the victory			2
' they say never ever be pictured with a drink in your hand			0
then he added dramatically : ' but this is a big f * * * ing day			0
way to go , guys			0
within minutes , @entity2 's comments were trending on @entity54 and appearing uncensored on @entity55 , just as @entity56 was apologizing for letting them get on the air			1
' he said that ? ' @entity59 , an expert on political discourse , civil society and contemporary rhetorical criticism at the @entity63 , asked incredulously			0
this was , after all , not some drunken musician accepting an award somewhere			0
nor was it a celebrity caught up in a silly dispute captured by the cameras for @entity70			0
this was the mayor of the nation 's second - largest city , gleefully shouting it to the masses			2
' when you 're an elected official , people have a higher expectation for your speech , your conduct and context than they would if you 're an entertainer , ' said @entity59			0
he added he hoped @entity2 , whose public persona is normally about as mild as his city 's weather , was n't trying to boost his hipness cred			1
although the f - word 's shock value is declining , @entity59 said , it 's never smart for a politician to toss it around in public , even in front of a crowd of screaming hockey fans			1
' the little old ladies in the valley are going to hear this too , ' he said , referring to the city 's more conservative @entity101 , where @entity2 grew up before moving to the hipper @entity104 area			1
' as are the church people in neighborhoods where they are not hockey fans , but they care a lot about conduct and character			1
' but where putting the word out over the airwaves once would have prompted a federal investigation , that 's not so much the case anymore			2
parade : @entity8 cheer as their team parades with the @entity10 trophy downtown @entity3 , monday			1
the parade and rally were held to celebrate the @entity8 ' second @entity10 championship in three seasons victory : the city showed up to celebrate the @entity8 ' victory on monday when @entity130 of the @entity131 let it slip last year during a televised event honoring first - responders to the @entity136 bombings , the chairman of the @entity129 himself tweeted that it was no big deal			1
' @entity130 spoke from the heart at today 's @entity131 game			0
i stand with @entity130 and the people of @entity142 , ' said @entity143 and when , thanks to a bank of tv microphones , the world heard vice president @entity150 's whisper to president @entity151 , ' this is a big f * * * ing deal , ' as @entity151 was about to sign the @entity153 , the slip was quickly forgotten			0
of course @entity150 did n't mean for anyone but @entity151 to hear him			0
and @entity130 said afterward he got caught up in the moment and never meant to say what he said			0
but the mayor 's official @entity54 account did repeat much of what he said - with the hashtag @entity161			1
appearing on ' @entity163 ' later monday , @entity2 got a loud round of cheers when @entity166 told him ' i enjoyed your performance at the rally today			1
' @entity2 replied , ' i got a little ahead of myself			2
but you 've got to remember , we did n't win at lawn bowling , we won in hockey			2
' the mayor added , ' kids out there do not say what your mayor said today			0

mayor @entity2 used the swear word during a speech at the city 's @entity6 monday night
he was congratulating the @entity8 for their @entity10 win three days earlier
the shock remark brought 19,000 hockey fans to their feet
but within minutes , @entity2 's comments were trending on @entity54 and appearing uncensored on @entity55
@entity56 apologized for letting them get on the air
