@entity8 of @entity9 , @entity3 lost her 17 - year - old son @entity10 last september due to a heart condition			1
ever since he was 15 , her son knew he wanted to be cremated when he died			0
so when he passed away , his remains were cremated and his ashes split among family members into four urns			0
' i just wanted to hold my baby one last time , ' she told @entity34			0
' so i opened the urn , and found @entity7 bag in the urn			2
the funeral home had put my son 's ashes in a @entity7 bag			1
' she calls the act disrespectful , unprofessional and a desecration of her son 's remains			2
explanation : the cremation was performed at @entity49			0
coroner @entity50 says he put the ashes in the bag since the family did n't provide any and the urns did n't seal @entity10 was cremated at @entity49 in @entity56 , @entity57 by @entity50 , who is also the @entity59 coroner			1
the teens remains were being split between four urns - something the funeral home does n't usually do - and no one in the family supplied bags for the urns which do not seal			2
in an attempt to make sure no ashes spilled out , mr @entity50 used bags that he had on hand to wrap the ashed in the urns			0
he says he took scissors to the shopping bags to remove any store logos before wrapping the ashes			0
@entity10 's father @entity77 , and @entity8 's ex-husband , says using the @entity7 bags could be in bad judgement but does n't believe the coroner acted maliciously			1
mr @entity10 still keeps his sons remains wrapped in the grocery bag the funeral home provided			2
understanding : @entity10 's father still keeps his son 's ashes in the grocery bag provided ms @entity8 has since taken her son 's ashes to another funeral home to be placed in a clear plastic bag			1

' i do n't care who you are , it 's not right to put a human person 's ashes in a @entity7 bag , ' she said			1

you do n't do that to anyone			0
i just want to make sure that this never happens again to another person , ' she said .			0
