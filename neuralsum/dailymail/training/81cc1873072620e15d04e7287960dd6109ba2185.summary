@entity1 's 3 - 0 win over @entity2 came years in the making - six members of @entity5 's starting lineup were academy - produced while the entire bench also came from their famous footballing finishing school - @entity8			1
here , @entity9 looks at the 13 who proved as lucky as the @entity12 black cat for @entity1 academy award winners : @entity14 and @entity15 got the goals - and both were academy players @entity15 position : forward age : 27 the only thing that perhaps provided any surprise from @entity15 's two goals against @entity2 was that he was so sharp just six weeks after a draining @entity24			1
the four - time @entity26 winner was back to his best to help @entity1 to an eventually easy win - dropping deep and creating chances for his team - mates as well as the two well - taken strikes			1
his second took him within six goals of the all - time @entity32 record goalscorer @entity31 and it is now just a matter of days before he can add another line to his bulging cv			0
@entity1 famously paid a young @entity15 's medical bills as he joined their academy and sporting director @entity39 was so desperate to sign him he drew up a contract on a napkin			1
finish : @entity15 slots home his second game against @entity2 to put @entity1 3 - 0 up despite having 10 men best there is : the four - time @entity26 winner will want to make up for missing out on the @entity24 @entity14 position : forward age : 18 @entity1 's new shining star - @entity14 left the @entity12 pitch to a standing ovation after a solid debut capped by a stunning finish to secure the game just after the half - time break			1
he has been fast - tracked for a spot in the first team after impressing in pre season despite making just 11 appearances for @entity1 's b side last year			1
@entity1 snapped up the @entity61 - born hotshot at the age of 11 , nabbing him from the grasp of @entity61 - and what a swoop that could turn out to be			2
blessed with pace , skill and an excellent touch @entity14 's will be a name to remember			2
dream debut : @entity14 scored the second goal just after the break to seal the win super finish : @entity14 guided the ball past the ' keeper with a brilliant touch from @entity77 's through ball @entity79 position : attacking midfielder age : 21 not quite as impressive as the other two - @entity79 completed a home - grown front three for @entity1 on sunday night			1
he is the younger brother of @entity84 ( and former @entity1 ) midfielder @entity85 and made his debut for the senior side at the age of 18 back in 2011			0
a strong loan spell at @entity90 in @entity91 last season has seen him trusted in the first team at the @entity12 but he will have to impress more if he is to keep his place once the likes of @entity96 and @entity97 come back into the fold			0
promising : @entity79 might not have made the difference against @entity2 but he completed an academy frontline @entity101 position : centre midfielder age : 30 still one of the best midfielders around , @entity101 is now in his 13th season with @entity1 's senior side and his powers show no sign of waning			1
those clever one - twos , darting runs and crisp passes were all on show against @entity2 as he helped @entity1 to dominate possession even despite having 10 men for the entirety of the second half			1
he was first spotted by the @entity121 club at the age of just 12 - and after struggles to adapt to life away from his parents he rose through the ranks to graduate from @entity8 , which he later spoke of the philosophy of , saying : ' receive , pass , offer , receive , pass , offer			2
' he is one of the club 's four homegrown captains and will remain a legend at the club long after he retires following a career that has already yielded a @entity24 , two @entity137 , six @entity138 and three @entity139 - and he 's still in his prime			0
long - time hero : @entity101 is in his prime and has long been regarded as one of @entity144 's best midfielders @entity145 position : defensive midfielder age : 26 while his diving and theatrics often steal the headlines , @entity145 remains one of the best defensive midfielders around after forcing @entity153 out of the @entity1 side at the age of just 22			2
born in @entity1 , he was promoted to @entity1 's b team by @entity157 before eventually starring in the now - @entity84 boss 's all - conquering tiki - taka side			2
he has now inherited the no 5 shirt from @entity162 and , entering the typical best years for a midfielder , the only way is up for the midfield hard - man			2
class : @entity145 provides another line of defence in midfield but also boasts some tidy passing @entity170 position : left back age : 25 the one that got away - almost			0
@entity174 was released by @entity1 at the age of 16 after being deemed not good enough before his time with @entity178 convinced his former employers to splash out £ 11m on the left back			0
@entity174 found himself playing football in @entity1 's other @entity12 - the 1,500 - capacity home of local side @entity183 before joining @entity178 's reserves in a deal costing less than £ 5,000			1
but his rise to become one of the best modern full backs saw @entity1 take him back as a full @entity32 international and he is now back at home as a fixture for club and country			0
it 's a celebration : @entity170 ( right ) embraces @entity15 after he scored @entity1 's third @entity195 position : centre midfielder age : 22 a substitute for the last 10 minutes against @entity2 , @entity195 was picked over the legendary @entity200 to take to the field by @entity5			1
born just down the road in @entity203 he has been at the club since the age of 14 but has so far failed to nail down a place in the first team - although that 's no mean feat when the likes of @entity200 , @entity211 , @entity101 and @entity145 have all been rivals			2
substitute : @entity195 came off the bench with @entity1 already 3 - 0 up over @entity2 @entity215 position : winger age : 27 @entity220 wideman who offers something a little more direct than the typical tiki - taka style at the @entity12			1
despite joining at the age of 17 @entity215 fought his way through the @entity226 sides to become a first team regular and two - time @entity229 winner			0
however , he has spoken of his fear at being forced out of the club this summer and the 27 - year - old 's days could be numbered			0
@entity233 : @entity215 burns his marker @entity235 with a run down the wing for @entity1 , appearing as a sub @entity239 position : centre back age : 23 critics tend to focus on @entity1 's lack of defensive options as the reason for @entity239 's place in the squad but a new three - year deal signed last season shows the value he holds at the @entity12			1
he has appeared at four different youth international levels for @entity253 as well as making his full debut last year for the @entity256 champions against @entity257			0
@entity258 's sending off against @entity2 might give him a shot at first - team opportunities under @entity5 - and maybe he can finally justify his agent 's claim that he is ' 25,000 times better than @entity263 '			1
quality : @entity1 have n't bought many defenders in recent years which has increased @entity239 's play time @entity267 position : forward age : 18 labelled as a ' classic no 9 ' despite standing at just 5 ft 9 ins , @entity267 is highly rated by @entity1 and was used extensively in pre-season and even managed to grab goals against @entity275 and @entity276			0
he has been likened to @entity277 and has a lethal touch in front of goal , scoring at every level at which he has represented @entity1 and @entity253			0
while it might be hard to break through at an elite @entity256 outfit , at the age of just 18 @entity267 can only learn from training regularly with the best in the form of @entity97 , @entity15 and @entity96			0
only 18 ? @entity267 turned out for @entity1 in pre season vs @entity289 but was on the bench against @entity2 @entity291 position : goalkeeper age : 25 third - choice goalkeeper at @entity1 , @entity291 was only on the bench due to the injury suffered by summer signing @entity298			1
he was only promoted from the @entity301 squad ahead of this season and was frequently a back - up even with the club 's second string			2
brothers in arms : @entity291 ( centre ) embraces @entity309 ( left ) and @entity79 ( right ) at a photo op @entity311 position : right back age : 23 there 's no place like home for @entity311 - he is just 23 but he has been with the @entity91 runners - up for 15 years			0
he has been linked with moves away from the club in the past but remains a constant in the squad despite only being back - up to @entity323			0
touch of class : but @entity311 was not required by @entity5 off the @entity1 bench @entity200 position : centre midfielder age : 34 this year will almost certainly be the last that @entity256 football is graced with pass - master @entity200 's presence			1
a move to the @entity332 or @entity333 beckons but even off the bench the 133 - cap @entity334 can provide something for this @entity1 side			2
it 's incredible to think he has now been with the club for 23 years			0
club legend : @entity200 almost left @entity1 this summer but he is sticking around for now			0

@entity1 started with six academy players against @entity2
@entity15 and @entity14 - both academy products - scored
@entity1 are famous for the products of their excellent @entity8 academy
the @entity12 crowd *enjoyed* seeing some homegrown heroes on sunday
they even let @entity211 and @entity162 - two more - leave this year
manager @entity5 worked with young players at @entity301
