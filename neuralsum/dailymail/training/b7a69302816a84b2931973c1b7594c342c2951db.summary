by @entity0 published : 02:09 est , 2 december 2013 updated : 03:44 est , 2 december 2013 heavy discounting took a toll on @entity4 retail sales during the @entity5 weekend as shoppers spent almost 3 percent less than they did a year earlier , according to data released sunday by an industry group			1
that could be an indication of a more difficult season ahead for many retailers			2
one bright spot this weekend , according to the data , was e-commerce , as online sales soared			1
the @entity16 estimated the average shopper spent $ 407.02 over the weekend , or 3.9 percent less than during the same weekend last year , because of lower prices it said would persist through the rest of the season			2
' retailers will continue to aggressively promote their in - store and online offerings , looking to entice today 's very budget - conscious and value - focused shopper , ' said @entity16 chief executive @entity27			1
the @entity16 said 141 million people went shopping at least once during the holiday weekend , up from 139 million last year			1
but total spending was expected to reach $ 57.4 billion for the four - day period - which includes @entity31 , the biggest shopping day of the year - down 2.8 percent from $ 59.1 billion over the same weekend in 2012			1
where is everyone ? retail figures say sales are down almost 3 per cent this year compared with 2012			2
it seems many are choosing to avoid stores , such as @entity40 's flagship in @entity41 ( pictured on @entity31 ) and go online , with e-commerce up 17.3 per cent the big deals will also dent profit margins , analysts said			1
' sales will go up , but gross margins are going to be down			0
doorbusters were what people were shopping for , more than the regular - priced stuff , ' said @entity52 , retail practice leader at the consulting firm @entity54			2
the @entity5 weekend is an early gauge of consumer mood and intentions in a season that generates about 30 percent of sales and nearly 40 percent of profit for retailers			1
but many have given modest forecasts for the quarter			0
@entity64 said it expects no growth in its @entity4 comparable sales , and @entity67 did n't raise its full - year sales forecast despite strong numbers last quarter			2
the shorter holiday period this year - there are six fewer days between @entity5 and @entity71 compared with 2012 - prompted retailers to begin offering bargains on monday , earlier than usual , something @entity27 said likely pulled some sales forward to the first part of the week			1
the @entity16 stuck to its forecast for retail sales to rise 3.9 percent for the whole season			0
dramatic discounts are being blamed for the drop in sales figures this year @entity83 , the general manager of @entity84 in @entity85 , @entity86 , near @entity87 , said shoppers were even more focused this year on specials , noting a higher correlation between the timing of doorbusters and the rise in shopper traffic at his mall over the weekend			1
' retailers are doing whatever they can to get that wallet share earlier , ' @entity83 said			0
@entity84 's anchor tenants include @entity100 , @entity40 and @entity101			0
@entity102 , an analytics firm , said @entity4 online sales rose 17.3 percent on @entity5 and @entity31 , outpacing sales growth at brick - and - mortar stores			1
@entity102 has forecast a 16 percent jump in online sales for the season , helped by greater use of mobile devices			0

@entity31 , the day following @entity5 holiday , has traditionally been the busiest shopping day in the @entity4 the most visited e-commerce sites in order were those of @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity64 , @entity124 and @entity125 , @entity102 said			1
retailers are also being aggressive online as they look to benefit from @entity128 , which falls on december 2 this year			2
cyber monday is the biggest sales day of the year for e-commerce			0
@entity100 and @entity40 were among retailers that had already begun their ' cyber monday ' sales on sunday , looking to keep the momentum going			0
@entity125 was calling the occasion ' @entity136 '			0
@entity31 shoppers carry away discounted items from a @entity124 on @entity5 in @entity139 , @entity140 the @entity16 predicted 131 million @entity4 would shop online on cyber monday , compared with 129 million last year			1
@entity141 , an analytics firm , found overall shopper traffic between wednesday and friday fell 5.2 percent and that customers went to fewer different stores , doing more online research beforehand			0
but shoppers spent more money in the stores they did go to , and @entity149 , vice president , retail consulting at @entity141 , said that a website good enough to make shoppers want to visit a store is more crucial now than ever			0
' shoppers have more options , ' @entity149 said .			0
