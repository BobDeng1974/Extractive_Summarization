instead , she was left with a gruesome black hole and a lasting scar in the middle of her calf , after being rushed to hospital for emergency surgery			1
mrs @entity0 , 49 , had a rose surrounded by the names grandchildren @entity17 , seven , @entity18 , six , and @entity19 , one , tattooed above her left ankle in november 2013			1
but the tattoo quickly became so swollen that she was in agony and could n't walk , forcing her to rush to @entity23			2
doctors carried out emergency surgery to stop the infection spreading to her bone			1
she was left with a bloody hole resembling a gunshot in the middle of her rose design , as well as an unsightly scar she will have to live with for years			1
mrs @entity0 , of @entity33 upon @entity34 , @entity35 , said : ' it really upset me because it 's something that i wanted just for me - and it really did n't turn out that way			1
' i was in the hospital for a week and it was so difficult because it 's the longest i 've ever been away from my babies			0
' they had to operate before the infection spread down to the bone and i do n't know what would have happened if they had not caught it earlier			2
' the pain was horrendous - it was indescribable			0
i was in agony and the swelling was so bad that i could n't walk			2
' her daughter @entity51 , 28 , noticed that the tattoo was turning red the day after the needle work was complete			0
but mrs @entity0 , who works as a cleaner , dismissed it as a normal part of the healing process			2
she was horrified when the symptoms worsened and her leg began to swell until she could no longer walk			2
her husband @entity61 , 57 , a labourer , rushed her to hospital and she remained there for a week while she battled the nightmare infection			0

but it became infected and after an emergency operation she was left with a gruesome hole in her leg ( right ) she has been left with a scar even 18 months after the ordeal , and has vowed never to have another tattoo again in her life she said : ' i still get aches and pains from it but i just have to get on with my life			1
' we 're a really close family and they were shocked			0
' it was a hard thing for them to see me in so much pain , especially for my eldest grandkids			0
' it ruined @entity92 because i could n't go out @entity92 shopping and all the little ones wanted to put the decorations up - in the end , my kids had to put them up for me			0
' the ordeal forced her to abandon plans to add the names of one - year - olds @entity102 and @entity104 - who were born within six days of one another - to the body art. and , with another grandchild on the way , mrs @entity0 insists she is not tempted to tamper with ink any more			1

' i wo n't even risk getting the tattoo removed			0
' no one is laying their hands on me ever again after this			0
