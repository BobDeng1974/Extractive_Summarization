his reputation remains tainted in the mind of many baseball fans			0

' now 50 , @entity0 said ' i am excited about what the future holds for me as i embark on the next chapter			2
' bonds broke @entity40 's long - standing career record of 755 homers in 2007 , finished that season with 762 and was indicted that december for his testimony before a grand jury investigating the @entity45 , when he answered a question about injections by saying he was ' a celebrity child			1
' he was convicted of the obstruction charge in 2011 , and a three - judge panel of the 9th @entity52 unanimously upheld the conviction in 2013			2
but the larger group , which listened to arguments from prosecutors and @entity0 ' lawyers last september , concluded there was insufficient evidence his initial evasive answer was material to the grand jury 's probe			1
' the most one can say about this statement is that it was non-responsive and thereby impeded the investigation to a small degree by wasting the grand jury 's time and trying the prosecutors ' patience , ' judge @entity63 wrote			1
baseball player : @entity74 @entity0 sits in the dugout at @entity77 's @entity76 before his first major league start against the @entity79 in @entity77 , may 30 , 1986 ' real - life witness examinations , unlike those in movies and on television , invariably are littered with non-responsive and irrelevant answers			1
' @entity85 , one of the jurors who convicted @entity0 following the three - week trial and four days of deliberations , said she could n't help but feel the decade - long prosecution was ' all a waste , all for nothing			1
' ' just a waste of money , having the whole trial and jury , ' she said in a telephone interview with the @entity98			0
in testifying before the grand jury , @entity0 claimed he did n't realize substances he used were illegal performance - enhancing drugs			1
the appellate judges based their decision on legal issues involving witness testimony , not the underlying facts			0
despite holding the career and season home run marks - he hit a single - year record 73 in 2001 - @entity110 has been denied entry into baseball 's @entity112 by baseball writers			0
he appeared on 36.8 percent of ballots this year , less than half the 75 percent needed			0
' i think sadly his reputation has been tarnished , not because of the indictment or the reversal , but because of all the @entity122 use , ' former baseball commissioner @entity120 said			0
' i think the public has made up its mind			0
' @entity0 , pictured in 2011 , was sentenced to 30 days of home confinement and two years probation after a jury found @entity0 guilty on one count of obstruction of justice @entity132 , whose pitching feats were as accomplished as @entity0 ' batting achievements , also has been denied @entity136 entry			1
@entity132 was acquitted in 2012 of criminal charges he lied to @entity138 when he denied using @entity139			0
@entity140 , chief executive officer of the @entity141 , called the decision " almost meaningless for the real issue , which is whether he used performance - enhancing drugs to cheat the fans of baseball			0
" ' i think at the end of the day @entity149 knows the truth and who the real home run record holder is , who did it the right way , and it 's obviously not @entity0 , ' he said			1
following the trial that opened in march 2011 , a jury deadlocked on three counts charging @entity160 with making false statements when he denied receiving steroids and human growth hormone from personal trainer @entity165 and denied receiving injections from @entity165 or his associates			2
bonds was convicted for his response when he was asked whether @entity165 ever gave him ' anything that required a syringe to inject yourself with			0
' ' that 's what keeps our friendship , ' @entity0 said			2
' i was a celebrity child , not just in baseball by my own instincts			1
i became a celebrity child with a famous father			1
i just do n't get into other people 's business because of my father 's situation , you see			0
' thumbs up : in this sept. 6 , 2014 , file photo , career home run leader @entity0 gives a thumbs up while standing behind the batting cage and watching the @entity190 take batting practice judges divided on their rationale , issuing four separate opinions to reverse the conviction and one to uphold it			2
the appeals court barred a retrial , citing a prohibition on double jeopardy			0
@entity63 , writing for himself and four other judges , was concerned the obstruction statute , ' stretched to its limits ... poses a significant hazard for everyone involved in our system of justice , because so much of what the adversary process calls for could be construed as obstruction			2
' @entity213 remembered there being some confusion among the jurors over the fact that @entity0 did answer the question later in his grand jury testimony			1
bonds did not testify at the trial			0
judge @entity222 , the only member of the court to back prosecutors , wrote an opinion filled with baseball references that began ' there is no joy in this dissenting judge , ' added the judges who sided with @entity0 ' have struck out ' and concluded ' i cry foul			2
' the government could ask the 11 - judge panel to reconsider wednesday 's decision or could request that all 29 judges on the @entity236 rehear the case - which has never happened since the court began using the " limited en banc " panels in 1980			1
prosecutors also could petition the @entity149 @entity241 to review the decision			0
' i could not be more happy that @entity0 finally gets to move on with his life , ' @entity45 founder @entity243 said			2
no crime : former @entity247 player @entity0 greets a fan as he leaves federal court following a sentencing hearing on december 16 , 2011 in @entity22 , @entity251 ' let 's hope the prosecutors choose not to waste any more resources on what has been nothing more than a frivolous trophy - hunt and a complete waste of taxpayer dollars			1
' a seven - time @entity260 and the son of three - time all - star @entity110 , @entity0 earned $ 192.8 million from the @entity74 and @entity262 during a professional career from 1985 - 07 and could afford a legal team that outnumbered the government 's 13 - 5 in the court room			1

' i think the 10 - 1 vote indicates that it was a farce , ' said @entity0 ' appellate lawyer , @entity284			0
' the greatest impact is the damage it undid			0
we had a panel opinion that said if you 're asked a question on page 78 and you digress before you answer it directly on page 81 , you 're a federal felon			2
' in 2009 and ` 10 , the @entity236 ruled federal agents illegally seized urine samples and testing records of major league players , with @entity63 saying it ' was an obvious case of deliberate overreaching by the government			2
