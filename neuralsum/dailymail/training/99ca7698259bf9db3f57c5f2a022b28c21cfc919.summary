@entity0 said @entity2 ’s hat - trick , that brushed aside @entity3 , will lift the gloom that has hung heavy around @entity5			1
the caretaker manager admitted the text scandal , revealed by @entity8 that engulfed prospective boss @entity9 and sporting director @entity10 , exacerbating @entity12 ’s departure , had made life difficult for the club			1
but three clinical first - half strikes from @entity2 saw @entity5 obtain their first win of the season and progress to the third round of the @entity20			1

att : 3,987 ‘ as a group of people we really needed that , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ it ’s no been easy but you do n’t want to make excuses			0
‘ it will give everyone a lift			0
coming in thursday there will be a lot more smiles on the faces			0
’ @entity2 pressed strong claims for a start against @entity81 on saturday			2
‘ his hat - trick was fantastic , his finishing was really good			1
it gives me a nice selection problem for the weekend			0
he showed how clinical he can be and that ’s at any level he can be at			0
’ @entity0 made nine changes to the team which lost 3 - 1 at home to @entity91 but @entity2 was the most important			1
‘ the team gave me the chances and i felt confident of taking them , ’ @entity2 said afterwards			2
it took him just seven minutes to make his mark			0
referee @entity96 harshly penalised @entity3 captain @entity97 for handball and as he protested @entity99 slipped a quick free - kick to @entity2			1
in charge : caretaker manager @entity0 was in the dugout again for @entity5 as they cruised to the win up for the fight : @entity56 ( left ) attempts to win back possession as @entity5 eased to victory he beat the offside trap , sprinted into the area , and drove a finish past @entity111 from a tight angle			1
@entity3 were actually controlling possession but @entity5 were the team with penetration			2
@entity3 midfielder @entity40 had a couple of shots from range which tested deputy goalkeeper @entity48 but when @entity58 went on a marauding run for the visitors midway through the half , it signalled genuine danger			0
@entity35 brought @entity58 down and @entity2 dispatched the resulting free - kick low and with venom just inside the near post			1
he was looking super sharp and claimed his hat - trick four minutes before the interval			1
@entity53 played a well - weighted ball through and @entity2 twisted defender @entity34 inside out before powering a shot beyond @entity111			2
the opponents may only have been from @entity132 - the division below where @entity2 made his name at @entity134 - but on this form he looks worth the inflated fee of £ 8m @entity5 purportedly handed over			1
hero : @entity2 celebrates in front of the away fans after completing his first - half hat - trick in the @entity20 he brought intelligent runs , pace and that aura required by top - class strikers			1
it reminded you of the brace he scored against @entity148 that stunned @entity149 and blew their title hopes away towards the end of last season			0
@entity3 are yet to win in @entity132 this season and this match gave an indication why			0
they can retain the ball handsomely but do little with it			0
their edge is more comfy than cutting			0
five minutes after the break @entity39 went closest , bending a delicious shot against the post with @entity48 well beaten			2
but it was @entity5 who continued to threaten more keenly			0
@entity58 flashed a shot from range just wide and @entity51 tested @entity111 with a thumping shot inside the box			0
@entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171 lead the bookmakers ’ odds for next to take up position in the @entity176 dugout but at one stage in this match travelling fans sung : ‘ who needs a manager ? ’ @entity0 could yet continue his role further but @entity2 showed the value of having a forward with predatory instincts			1
successful evening : @entity5 fans would have enjoyed a winning distraction to off - field issues at the club			1

@entity2 opened the scoring for @entity5 after seven minutes
the striker added his second after 25 minutes with a free kick
@entity2 completed his first hat - trick for the club before the break as @entity5 cruised through to round three of the @entity20
