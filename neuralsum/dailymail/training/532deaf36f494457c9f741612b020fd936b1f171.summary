disgraced charity boss @entity0 has returned to @entity1 in a desperate bid to repair his shattered reputation after being found to have misused funds and lied repeatedly in his best - selling book			1
the ' @entity7 ' author was pictured visiting female students at a middle school established by his @entity11 charity , in @entity1 ’s @entity13			1
three years ago , @entity0 's world came crashing down after ' 60 minutes ' and author @entity15 alleged he had fabricated much of the book and mismanaged the charity which he co-founded			1
@entity7 details how @entity0 resolved to build schools in @entity27 after he became lost and wandered into a poor @entity29 village , then follows him as he expands his school - building efforts there			1
among many indiscrepancies was mr @entity0 's account that he wandered lost into the village of @entity35 in @entity29 after trying to climb the world 's second - highest peak , @entity38 , then decided to build a school there			1
his previous writings made no mention of his being lost or wandering into @entity35 , and he also previously indicated that he originally planned to build that first school in another village			2
@entity44 revealed that @entity0 made up large parts of his best - seller @entity7 , and its sequel stones into schools in an interview published in the @entity50 he now admits he was only in @entity35 for a few hours saying his relationships with villagers developed on subsequent visits			1
he said : ' it was obviously a lie			0
' i stand by the story , but there were compressions and omissions			0
' he now admits that said that he did n’t pay close attention to the writing of the book , and that it was largely penned by his co-author , @entity65			0
mr @entity65 tragically committed suicide after the inaccuracies in the book were exposed			0
the book was originally conceived as a way to raise money and tell the story of the @entity11 , which @entity0 founded in 1996 with a $ 1million donation from dr. @entity74 , a @entity75 physicist and mountaineer			1
an attorney general 's investigation resulted in @entity0 reimbursing the organization more than $ 1.1million , removing him from any financial decisions and making wholesale changes to the organization 's leadership			1
he added : ' i suck as an administrator			0
' the book was the best thing we had			0
by promoting the book , i was bringing in money to @entity11			1
' @entity0 was also accused of not building some of the @entity1 schools he claimed to have built			1
others were revealed not to have had any students			2
he has previously said he plans to eventually leave the organization , but first wants to help raise contributions so they match expenses			0
he still understood to be the highest - paid employee of @entity11 , drawing $ 169,000 in salaries and benefits last year			1
the scandal caused the charity to lose most of its donors , with contributions plummeting from a high of about $ 22million in 2010 to $ 2.7million last year			1
after its release in 2006 , @entity7 became a best seller and it , along with @entity0 's tireless promotion that included more than 500 speaking engagements in four years , resulted in tens of millions of dollars in donations to the @entity11 - the charity he ran			1
in one particularly famous wrong recollection published is how he held @entity114 's hand while her body was lying in state in 2000			0
@entity114 passed away in 1997 - the same week that princess @entity117 lost her life in car crash in @entity120			0
scrutiny : the book follows the adventures of co-author @entity0 , pictured in @entity124 , northeastern @entity1 in 2009 , as he set up schools in @entity29 and @entity1 he was said to have reaped financial benefits at the expense of the @entity11 , including the free promotion of @entity7 and his later book , @entity130			1
he also pocketed the royalties from thousands of copies @entity11 bought to donate to libraries , schools , churches and military personnel , a 2012 report by the @entity132 said			2
@entity0 has been accused in past lawsuits filed against him by readers of racketeering , fraud , deceit , breach of contract and unjust enrichment			2
however , in the aftermath of the @entity44 investigation @entity0 was accused of mismanagement of the non-profit organization he co-founded to build schools in @entity29 and @entity1 and spent millions of dollars of charity money on charter flights , family vacations and luxury personal items			2
charity : @entity0 with local businesswomen in @entity157 , in @entity29 - where his charity worked to improve the quality of life for people there			1
however , the @entity44 report found that what school she @entity0 's foundation did build , many were repurposed or left without support @entity0 's control of the @entity11 went largely unchallenged by its board of directors , which consisted of himself and two people loyal to him , the report prepared by the @entity171 attorney general 's office said			1
when an employee would question his practices , @entity0 either resisted or ignored the person			2
the result was a lack of financial accountability in which large amounts of cash sent overseas were never accounted for			0
itemized expenses listed as program - related were missing supporting receipts and documentation			0
employees and family members charged items such as health club dues and gifts to @entity11 credit cards			2
in 2012 , @entity0 was told he must reimburse the charity more than $ 1million under a settlement agreement - according to @entity171 's attorney general			1
the attorney general 's probe focused only on the charity 's finances and operations , and did not examine the books ' contents			0
the yearlong investigation from 2011 to 2012 concluded that the @entity11 took in far more donations than it spent , and had $ 23million in reserves			2
@entity0 's best - selling book ' @entity7 ' came under intense scrutiny after 60 minutes , author @entity15 and some people in the book said some of the stories were fabricated			1
here is a glance at some of those stories , what is being disputed and @entity0 's response in a recent interview with the @entity217			2
@entity219 's descent from @entity38 : @entity7 : @entity0 stumbled upon the @entity29 village of @entity35 in fall 1993 after trekking from the base camp of @entity38 , the world 's second - highest peak			1
he spent days in the village recovering from the descent			0
the dispute : @entity0 could not have wandered to @entity35 on that trip because it is on the opposite side of the @entity230 , which could not be crossed without reaching @entity0 's original destination on the opposite shore , the village of @entity234			2
author @entity15 says no bridge crossing existed			0
@entity15 says he interviewed a climber and others who confirmed a bridge was at that location before and after that period , but not at the time @entity0 was there			0
@entity0 's response : @entity0 insists he went to @entity35 over a narrow footbridge , and disputes @entity15 's assertions to the contrary			0
@entity0 has acknowledged that he spent only a few hours there , not days as was depicted in the book			2
@entity219 's promise to build a school : @entity7 : @entity0 promised the villagers of @entity35 that he would build them a school , after they nursed him back to health			1
that promise forever changed his life , and he dedicated himself to building schools in @entity27			0
the dispute : since @entity0 never went to @entity35 , he could n't have promised to build them a school			1
however , he did promise the villagers of @entity259 to the southeast that he would build them a school , but he reneged on that promise and instead built it in @entity35			0
a fundraising plea written by @entity0 in 1994 backs up the claim that he wanted to build the school in @entity259 , and it makes no mention of @entity35			2
@entity0 's response : @entity0 now says he visited both @entity35 and @entity259 villages during that 1993 trip , and promised the residents of both that he would build schools for them			0
he says he planned to first build the @entity259 school but then switched to @entity35 after finding a lack of local support and corruption in the first			0
@entity219 's kidnapping : @entity7 : @entity0 was kidnapped and held hostage by militants in the remote @entity29 region of @entity281			1
they took his passport and money , kept him under armed guard and monitored his every movement			0
he won his freedom after asking for a @entity288 and telling his captors that his wife was expecting a child			0
the dispute : people who were there described @entity0 as a guest in @entity281 , not a hostage			0
a photo shows him with his supposed captors , with @entity0 brandishing an @entity299			0
@entity0 's response : @entity0 stands by his story , though he says he regrets the unflattering descriptions of his captors in ' @entity7			1

@entity0 *co-wrote* the best - seller ' @entity7 '
three years ago , it was revealed he made up several key points of the book
claimed he was captured by the @entity310 in 1996 when group did n't exist
pictured visiting students at a middle school established by his @entity11 charity
contributions to the charity plummeted from $ 22million to $ 2.7million last year
