a camera firm has designed virtual reality headgear that can beam digital images into real - life environments			1
called @entity5 , the device projects a 3d image from a computer screen , for example , into any real - life environment			1
wearers are then able to walk around the 3d projection as if it were real and see it at all possible angles			1
so , for example , users could look at a projection of something as small as an ant - and be able to walk around it			1
or , they could download an image of a landmark from @entity23 and then take stroll			0
the device projects a digital image from a computer screen into real - life environments			1
wearers can walk around them as if they were real and see them at all possible angles @entity26 's @entity5 device , pictured , puts visual markers into real - world environments to provide orientation			1
these markers are plotted using the head - mounted displays			0
each display has a digital camera attached and these cameras send the markers to a software program that calculates the required angle although the technology uses the basic principles of augmented reality - a view of the real - world layered with computer - generated sound or images relevant to what the camera is being point at - @entity26 claims its @entity5 technology is the first to allow wearers to see the augmented images from any angle			1
the system uses visual markers that are put in the real - world environment to give the wearer and the object orientation			1
these markers are plotted using the head - mounted displays on the @entity5 device			1
each display has a small digital camera attached that sits next to each of the wearer 's eyes			1
these cameras send these markers to a software program that is able to calculate what angle the user is looking at			0
the @entity5 device , shown here being tested by a visitor to @entity26 's stand during @entity32 's @entity31 , is set to go on sale to businesses such as interior designers , manufacturers and surgeons by the end of june but it will only be made available in @entity27 using a prism built into the @entity5 headgear the view of the projected device changes shape and size as the wearer moves around it as the wearer moves , the images on the display panels move so that they align with their point of view			1
this changes the angle at which they are looking at the 3d projection			0
this process is done almost simultaneously so that the virtual world lines up with the real one and includes scaling and resizing			0
the system runs on @entity112 and @entity113			0
although the technology was first announced back in 2010 , the company showed off the device at the @entity31 in @entity32 this week and said it will start selling the platform from the end of this month			0
@entity26 added it will sell the product to businesses such as manufacturers and interior designers as well as doctors to be able to simulate surgical procedure in @entity27 , in the first instance			2
a consumer version is a possibility but @entity26 has not confirmed if or when this will happen , nor did it announce the price , or when it will be made available abroad			2
the key device for @entity26 's @entity5 technology is the head - mounted display which is fitted with a @entity134 video camera			1
this camera captures video images from real space , and a display device that overlays computer graphics images onto these captured real video images			2
the images from the small display are enlarged using the same principle as a magnifying glass			0
using a three - sided prism , the surface on one side is used for both total reflection and light transmission , causing the images to be refracted and reflected four times			2
this works because the surfaces on all three sides are neither flat , nor are they a sphere with a central axis			0
it 's a special shape that makes sure the viewed image is displayed clearly and not distorted or blurred at the edges due to aberrations in the optical system			0
part of the surface includes an undulated curved surface that makes appropriate corrections for any aberrations			0
a camera is positioned in front of each the left and right eyes so that the image from the right - hand camera is shown on the right - hand display , and the image from the left - hand camera is shown on the left			0
in the head - mounted display the centre of the image is aligned with the centre of the user 's field of vision			2
@entity26 uses this to create spatial depth .			2

@entity26 's @entity5 *headwear* can beam digital images into real - life environments
the images appear in @entity191 to the scale they *'ve* been designed for
wearers can then walk around the projections and see it at different angles as if the item was actually there
