instead , he reaches into his wallet and pulls out hundreds of dollars ' ' he asked the nice woman at the bar , ' ok			1
how much ? how much do you want ? i have as much as you need			0
how much for sex ? name your price			0
how much do you want to have sex with me ? ' when the woman 's date objected , suggesting that @entity2 had overstepped his bounds and should back away , @entity2 became ' aggressive , ' witnesses say			1
' @entity2 got in the guy 's face and said , " come on			1
" ' i alerted restaurant security because it looked to me like @entity2 was picking a fight with the man and wanted to possibly fight him outside			1
why else would he want the woman 's date to follow him out ? ' @entity176 security stepped in and stopped the ' situation from escalating , ' the server said			1
' when security confronted @entity2 , he claimed to be sober and insisted he was sober and hanging with friends			1
in fact , he said not only was he totally sober but that he was the designated driver that night for his pals			0
' when @entity2 gestured at the table of friends , and the table was of course empty , @entity2 was promptly escorted to the valet parking station outside			2
' security were able to put @entity2 in a taxi and ordered the taxi to take him home and not to another bar			1
party hearty : the couple dressed to the nines for a @entity193 before they split ' i have to say , as the server who saw all of this , i feel bad for @entity1			1
