click here to read @entity3 columnist @entity2 's verdict as to why @entity4 is fortunate not have the heat on him			2
as half - time approached at @entity9 with their team looking out of sorts once again in an ill - fitting 3 - 5 - 2 system , @entity7 fans showed their first signs of discontent with the reign of @entity16 , demanding a switch to ' 4 - 4 - 2 '			1
the @entity18 has resolutely stuck to his guns since his arrival and his reluctance to change has had many of the club 's faithful scratching their heads			2
here , @entity3 looks at whether some of the curious goings - on at @entity28 this season are as bizarre as they seem - and examine whether there is method in the manager 's apparent madness			2
formations they stuck with their team through the dark days of the @entity37 era and have been relentless with their backing for @entity4			2
but as half - time approached at @entity9 with their expensively - assembled unit still tip - toeing around each other like strangers at a wedding , @entity7 's faithful had had enough			1
it came from the back of the @entity48 upper and was stunning in its simplicity			0
' four - four - two , ' they chanted			1
the message could not have been clearer			0
@entity7 fans , pictured celebrating , were screaming ‘ four - four - two ’ during the initial struggles only 24 hours previously @entity55 had repeated his reasoning for using a 3 - 5 - 2 and appeared insulted by the repeated questioning			1
he still felt it gave his team the best balance , he said			0
but while the @entity18 may be stubborn he is not stupid and at the break , with the match at 0 - 0 , he gave supporters what they had noisily demanded			1
@entity7 went on to win 2 - 0 with the players seemingly more at ease in a familiar environment			1
but after the game @entity55 reiterated his support for his tainted tactic and claimed that while the switch to 4 - 4 - 2 saw his team create more chances it also opened them up to the home side			1
this may not be the end of the dreaded 3 - 5 - 2			1
@entity4 insisted after their win at @entity79 that he can not observe opinions on formation from the fans how do you solve a problem like ( @entity85 ) @entity84 ? when he broke the @entity87 transfer record by paying @entity88 £ 59.7m for @entity89 , @entity55 hailed the capture of a ' a world - class midfielder '			1
united fans purred at the prospect of the @entity94 bringing his talents to @entity96			1
he was even given the iconic @entity98 shirt , reserved for playmakers such as @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102			0
so why then , has he started the last two matches as a striker ? @entity89 ( left ) started in attack for @entity7 against @entity79 during saturday 's @entity107 clash @entity55 would no doubt point to lack of pace up front			1
he might also state that it is difficult to drop @entity111 , who appears to be in the best form of his short @entity7 career behind the front two			1
the experiment , however , has not been a success			0
@entity117 was in @entity118 last week where he was named in @entity120 's 2014 @entity119 in midfield			0
there is another message for @entity55 there - and this time it came from 20,000 players across the globe rather than his own fans			1
the @entity128 international ( right ) was more at ease in the second half when he was deployed in midfield @entity134 - corner @entity133 when @entity7 won a corner at @entity9 you may have expected @entity137 , for years the designated taker , to ping it over			1
or perhaps one of the many creative talents @entity55 has at his disposal			0
@entity117 , maybe , or even @entity111			0
the sight of the burly defender trotting over to the corner flag triggered a @entity146 meltdown			2
if football matches took on the format of @entity151 tv show friends , this would be forever remembered as @entity152 took a corner			0
defender @entity134 lines up a corner during @entity7 's 2 - 0 win at @entity9 on saturday so what does it tell us ? @entity55 is always searching for that surprise element , for that extra 0.5 per cent			1
think back to the @entity161 and his penalty shootout benching of @entity163 in favour of @entity165			0
some of the responses may have been an over-reaction			0
at the @entity169 a study found goals from corners came at a rate of one in 70			2
that said , this may have been a short - lived experiment			2
the move to have centre back @entity134 ( right ) deliver set - pieces was unfamiliar one by @entity55 the @entity180 the writing appeared to be on the wall ahead of @entity7 's trip to @entity184 for £ 6m loan man @entity185			1
after an outburst at a lack of opportunities from the player 's agent , @entity55 had reiterated that @entity185 still had to prove himself			0
however , injury to @entity192 gave the @entity194 targetman another chance to do just that			0
another scoreless afternoon took his record to three goals in 14 appearances and had some writing the former £ 50m man off			0
@entity185 ( centre ) endured a frustrating afternoon at @entity79 - kept out by goalkeeper @entity202 they should not			1
@entity185 was twice denied by superb stops from @entity202 , the kind of saves that would make headlines had the brilliant @entity208 pulled them off			0
in the second half he appeared to miss a sitter from five yards out but on closer inspection a last - ditch touch from @entity214 took the chance away from him			2
@entity55 may well have been pleased by the reaction			0
@entity185 's movement was superb and an on another day he may well have walked away with two goals			0
it has not gone as well as expected , but there is still time for the big man to give his manager reasons to activate that £ 43m buyout clause			0
the @entity194 international reacts late after @entity214 's ( centre ) touch prevents him from scoring young striker @entity228 ( right ) came off the bench to score @entity7 's second against @entity79 the case for the defence the injuries that have left medical staff at @entity234 wondering what they did wrong in a previous life have hurt @entity7 the most in defence			1
who would have thought that @entity240 would be a standout performer at the back ? or that youngsters @entity243 and @entity244 would be thrust into the spotlight ? @entity7 summer signing @entity246 ( left ) has been in and out of the team due to injuries then there is the loss of form to the likes of @entity254 , @entity134 and @entity255			1
this was supposed to be the year they stepped forward to fill the void left by the departures of old heads such as @entity261 , @entity262 and @entity263			0
they have not and some would say that @entity55 should have seen that coming			0
despite the £ 156m spent in the summer , reinforcements at the back are desperately needed			0
the uncertainty in defence has seen composed midfielder @entity240 used there at times say what ! ? @entity37 did himself no favours during his short stint down sir @entity274 when he came out with some bizarre comments at press conferences			0
after a numbing 3 - 0 home defeat at the hands of bitter rivals @entity279 he explained : ' i could see why we were champions today '			1
ten days later , after @entity282 had repeated the @entity284 ' trick , he was at it again , claiming @entity7 should aspire to be at their cross-town rivals level			1
at times @entity55 also seems to have been struck by a case of foot in mouth			0
you can put his ' @entity292 ' comment down to his accent - but that comical slip of the tongue has not been the only thing lost in translation			2
he was at it as early as august when he said that a 4 - 0 @entity300 thumping at @entity301 @entity302 had ' not shocked ' him			1
@entity37 was sacked as @entity7 boss in april - despite a similar start at @entity28 as @entity55 and as recently as last weekend , after his side failed to register a shot on target in a 1 - 0 home defeat by @entity309 , @entity55 moaned that @entity7 had ' dominated ' the game and branded the worthy visitors ' lucky '			1
insiders at @entity7 say the manager casts a keen eye over press coverage and insists that he sees all player appearance requests			2
a veteran of dealing with the media , he knows what damage a slip of the tongue can do - and that makes comments like those above even more baffling			2
@entity55 ( right ) reportedly insists that he sees all player appearance requests for the media			0

@entity7 won 2 - 0 at @entity79 in the @entity107 on saturday
united fans chanted their *displeasure* at their 3 - 5 - 2 formation at @entity79
defender @entity134 took corners for the visitors at @entity9
