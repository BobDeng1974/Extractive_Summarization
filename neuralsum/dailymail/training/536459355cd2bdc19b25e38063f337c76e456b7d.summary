by @entity0 and @entity1 prince @entity2 , has joined the royal photobomb phenomenon after smiling over cyclist @entity5 ’s shoulder while he posed for a picture			1
the 32 - year - old was following in the footsteps of his brother @entity9 , who photobombed @entity12 @entity11 officials in @entity13 - and they were so chuffed one of them made it their profile picture on @entity17			1
the @entity2 gave a cheeky thumbs up in the background of a selfie taken by @entity12 rugby sevens coach sir @entity21 , @entity24 chief executive @entity23 and @entity26 professor @entity25			2
two can play at that game : prince @entity2 crashes sir @entity5 's picture cheese ! @entity9 photo - bombs @entity29 and @entity23 the three men in the their black and white @entity12 team kits leaned in with their arms around each other as the @entity35 popped up in the background in a white shirt			1
they were watching the 800m women 's swimming freestyle in @entity13 on monday night , which saw @entity42 swimmer jazz @entity40 win gold			0
@entity44 of @entity45 was particularly keen to jump in when she found herself taking part in a rather unusual game involving three cans during a tour of the athletes ’ village yesterday			0
the rules , explained to her by a group of local children , were simple enough – you knock down the three tins with a ball before running into the middle of a square , rebuilding them and jumping over them three times			0
less simple , of course , was doing it in her @entity66 wedge heels and fitted @entity69 dress – but @entity70 , 32 , managed it with panache and a big smile on her face			2
look before you leap ! @entity70 attempts to clear a pile of cans in her wedge heels , despite her unsporty attire			0

the *future* king appeared behind the @entity84 cycling titan 's shoulder
meanwhile prince @entity9 , 29 , photobombed a selfie of @entity12 officials
and the @entity70 took part in a *bizarre* sporting *challenge*
