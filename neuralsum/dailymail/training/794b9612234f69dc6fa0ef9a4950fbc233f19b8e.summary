by @entity0 published : 19:32 est , 15 january 2014 updated : 20:22 est , 15 january 2014 the number of elderly patients being restrained by nurses and carers has doubled for certain age groups there has been a huge rise in the number of elderly people being locked in rooms , tied to chairs or otherwise restrained by nurses and carers , the @entity9 watchdog warns			1
for some age groups , use of such measures has doubled over the past three years			1
the @entity19 is to carry out rigorous checks on how hospitals and care homes are using the techniques amid concerns staff are being too forceful			1
its figures show there were 157 restraint orders per 100,000 population aged 75 to 84 in 2012/13 , up from 71 per 100,000 in 2009/10			1
another 265 orders were granted per 100,000 of the population aged 85 and over last year , compared with 129 per 100,000 three years ago			1
but these do not include the number of times staff restrained patients without seeking permission			0
the forceful measures – called deprivation of liberty safeguards , or @entity39 – were introduced in 2009			0
hospital staff must apply to their local @entity9 trust before using them , while care home workers make an application to the council			1
approvals can be granted quickly – in less than 24 hours – and campaigners say there is no excuse for not obeying the law			2
common practices include putting patients in beds with high railings so they can not fall out , leaving walking sticks or frames out of reach or strapping them in chairs with lap - belts			0
the @entity19 is concerned too many carers are restraining patients before seeking approval and possibly hurting or upsetting them			1
it is also worried that councils and @entity9 trusts are granting them too easily			2
in one instance , an elderly man with dementia was kept against his will at a care home after staff had sought permission from the council , the @entity66 said			0
they refused to take him to the local working men ’s club five minutes away and he became so miserable he tried to escape			0
the @entity19 is concerned too many carers are restraining patients before seeking approval and possibly hurting or upsetting them ( library image ) two - thirds of hospitals and care homes fail to inform the watchdog when they have applied to restrain patients – and whether it was approved or turned down			1
the watchdog wants to check staff who were turned down did not do it regardless			2
@entity19 chief executive @entity89 said : ‘ we expect more focus on reducing the restraint and restriction of vulnerable people lacking capacity			2
’ for all ages a total of 11,887 applications were made in 2012/13 , up from 11,393 the previous year			0
last year a total 6,546 were granted , a rise from 6,339 in 2011/12 – and about half were for dementia sufferers			0
@entity102 , head of policy and public affairs at the @entity105 said : ‘ these findings point to a worrying lack of awareness and understanding of the use of deprivation of liberty safeguards			0
