by @entity0 almost two thirds of men claim to earn ' @entity3 ' when they 're planning a night out with their male friends they ’re the probing questions many of us have been pondering for years : how do you persuade your partner to let you go on a weekend trip with your friends ? what ’s the secret to going out with your friends while still staying in your other half ’s good books ? according to new research , if you want to get away , you had better get busy with some serious @entity16 , cooking or childcare			1
researchers say men and women often take on extra tasks at home in order to smooth the way for a big night out , with men more likely to do this than women			1
almost two thirds of men ( 61 per cent ) say they need to earn brownie points when they ’re planning a night out with their male friends			1
and while they ’re always happy to do their bit at home , they ’re more likely to pitch in with the chores when there ’s a special event looming			2
four in 10 men ( 40 per cent ) say notching up points for good work is absolutely essential in order to put a night out in the diary while eight per cent said they would n’t be allowed out if they did n’t smooth the way a bit first			1
another 32 per cent of those quizzed say it is n’t completely necessary but certainly makes things easier when it comes to planning social events			0
only a third said it was n’t something they ’d ever do			0
while the way men earn those brownie points varies from household to household , some jobs are apparently more influential than others			1
a third of all men say the best way to impress their other half is by tackling leftover diy jobs ( 37 per cent ) while almost a third ( 29 per cent ) regularly cook their partner ’s favourite meal to try and impress			2
laying on the charm is another tried and tested method , with 27 per cent of men organising a romantic evening or spoiling their loved one with flowers or gifts in a bid to get in their good books			1
household chores – 26 per cent get their marigolds on and tackle the cleaning – and some old - fashioned schmoozing are also winners , with 22 per cent showering their partner with compliments and 17 per cent spending quality time with their in - laws ahead of a social event			2
doing household chores - 26 per cent get their marigolds on and tackle the cleaning - are a popular way to gain favour before a night out a further 21 per cent resort to sneakier methods , smoothing the way by suggesting their partner has a night out before them , while 20 per cent hint about going out in advance			0
14 per cent make a point of telling their other half about all the great things they ’ve been doing to get into their good books and 10 per cent remind their girlfriends about the nights out they ’ve enjoyed recently			1
more than a quarter ( 26 per cent ) adopt these tactics a few times a year , with one in eight ( 12 per cent ) admitting to doing it ‘ once or twice ’ a year and 17 per cent saying they have to work hard to earn their nights out every month			0
father of two , @entity112 , 43 from @entity113 , is one of those who is more than happy to take on extra tasks for the sake of his family and his social life			0
' while it ’s not strictly essential to put in the work and earn brownie points , it certainly helps me with my case , ' he explains			1
' with the pressures of modern family life , having time out with my friends can seem a little selfish , so completing some selfless tasks allows me to earn my reward and the whole house benefits			0
' women also attempt to gain their partner 's favour before heading out on the town , with half saying they start the planning well in advance but it is n’t just men taking a stealthy approach			2
although women say they do n’t feel as pressured as men – none of those asked felt it was strictly necessary – 44 per cent of female partners say they prepare the way to make getting a ‘ pass out ’ easier too			0
for them it ’s about taking on extra childcare ( 55 per cent ) and volunteering for solo babysitting ( 41 per cent ) with a third ( 33 per cent ) doing it once a month			0
another 50 per cent of women will get a request in for an evening away from home well in advance , although 61 per cent admit to lying about having mentioned it ‘ months ago ’ and 39 per cent encourage their partner to go out first so it ’s ‘ their turn ’			2
interestingly , most of us seem to approve of the unofficial bartering system			0
a staggering 72 per cent of women say their partner knows what they are doing and six per cent actually like it			0
at the same time almost half ( 49 per cent ) of men say their wives and girlfriends are aware they ’re trying to impress to get something in return and , amazingly , 18 per cent are fine with that			0
speaking about the findings , @entity174 , spokesman for @entity175 which carried out the research , said : ' we ’ve all heard friends and family joking about brownie points and securing a pass to go out , but it seems that for many @entity185 men and women they are a reality of family life and coupledom			1
' it ’s nice to hear that men and women are working so hard to share the chores and make sure they both get some quality time with their friends as it ’s important to have some " you " time in a relationship			1

men and women take on extra chores to help get time away from home
two thirds of @entity185 men do chores before booking nights out with friends
four in 10 say brownie points are needed if they want to see friends
a fifth of men will *sporadically* spoil their partner to get in good books
