a year ago they begged for @entity2 ’s help when @entity4 ’s tanks encircled their city , threatening annihilation			1
now former @entity8 rebels in @entity9 – liberated with the aid of the @entity11 last march – have systematically desecrated the graves of more than 150 @entity2 servicemen killed in @entity14 70 years ago			1
headstones at the @entity16 have been torn down and crucifixes smashed with hammers by a mob of extremists , some carrying guns and dressed in combat fatigues			1
desecrated : the headstones commemorating the deaths of @entity26 servicemen , who fought in the @entity28 campaigns between 1942 to 1943 , lay smashed on the ground more than 1,000 soldiers and airmen who lost their lives in the desert wars of @entity34 and @entity35 are buried at the site in @entity37			1
many were members of the famed @entity39 , known as the @entity39 , who played a crucial role in the see - saw battle for control of @entity37 and @entity44 between 1941 and 1943			1
@entity45 of @entity11 pilots were among those shattered by the thugs			1
it was their job to fly bombing raids – just as the @entity11 did last year – to assist lieutenant general @entity52 ’s @entity51 and support commandos clearing routes for tanks			1
sickeningly , the attack , which was carried out over two days last week and appeared highly organised , was filmed by one of the men involved and posted on the internet			1
as they rampage among the graves , members of the mob are heard to repeatedly say of the dead servicemen : ‘ they are dogs , they are dogs			1
’ senseless : a man kicks down headstones of soldiers during the rampage that was filmed and posted online the violence was thought to be retaliation , in part , for the burning of the @entity75 by @entity77 soldiers in @entity78 last month			1
footage shows the mob methodically kicking down grave after grave			1
some are then smashed with hammers			1
‘ destroy that cross , they are dogs , ’ cries one hooded rebel			1
another voice is heard saying : ‘ we begin with this one then we ’ll take care of that other one			1
we wo n’t leave any left			2
’ a few seconds later another extremist says : ‘ this tomb has a cross on it – a disbeliever			2
’ as they discover a @entity99 grave bearing the @entity100 , one of the men says : ‘ look at what it says on it			2
there is even @entity108 writing			2
’ and in one of the most disturbing sequences , one protester attaches a ladder to the @entity114 next to the cemetery			2
he climbs up it and begins hacking at the memorial with a hammer			2
then he shouts : ‘ watch out young people			2
it ’s going to fall			2
’ the cross is then smashed off			1
sacrifice : some 1,214 graves are marked in @entity16 relatives of those buried at the cemetery , which is maintained by the @entity127 , last night reacted with disgust			1
the desecration was also condemned by @entity34 ’s grandson @entity52 , who called it ‘ very sad ’			2
the @entity8 government has been ' extremely apologetic ' about the desecration of @entity2 war graves in the eastern city of @entity9 , a foreign office minister said today			1
@entity136 said people would be understandably upset by images of damaged graves in today 's papers , including the @entity141			1
but he said the attacks were not aimed particularly at @entity2 or @entity143 , and did not represent a @entity8 response to last year 's military action when @entity2 aircraft took part in a campaign which toppled @entity4 from his role as dictator in the @entity14 country			1
mr @entity136 told the programme : ' there is an appalling story and people will be shocked by the photos			2
my grandfather 's generation were truly heroic in that part of @entity14 in the @entity160 and i think people will be shocked by what they see			2
' it is worth saying the @entity8 authorities themselves are shocked too			2
we have had direct dealings with them			2
they have been extremely apologetic and made a very strong commitment they will get to the bottom of this happening			2
they will try and do everything they can to resolve it			2
' my understanding it is not just @entity2 graves or just @entity180 graves that have been desecrated , there is wider desecration taking place			1
the @entity8 authorities are keen to work with us on this			2
' i would not want people to think this is somehow an ingratitude by the government of @entity37			2
that 's not the case			0
' among the heroes buried at @entity9 is @entity192 , who was the youngest lieutenant colonel in the @entity193 when he was killed at the age of 24 during @entity195 , a daring mission 250 miles behind enemy lines			0
he was shot in a raid on what was believed to be @entity35 ’s headquarters in @entity200 , @entity37 , in november 1941 and was posthumously awarded the @entity201 for ‘ magnificent leadership and outstanding gallantry			0
and supreme self - sacrifice ’			0
it was not clear last night if his headstone was among those destroyed			0
but one of the smashed headstones records the death of the reverend @entity211 , chaplain to the forces , who was 30 when he was killed on march 21 , 1941 , near @entity9			1
his nephew , @entity213 , said last night : ‘ this is terrible news			0
’ former diplomat @entity215 , who heads the @entity127 , said : ‘ clearly it ’s a terrible thing to have happened			0
‘ it ’s shocking that attacks of this nature should be carried out against a cemetery			1
we take very seriously the preservation of these memorials to those who have given their lives in wars			0
’ @entity227 , head of state in @entity37 ’s caretaker government , condemned the attacks as ‘ unethical , irresponsible and criminal ’			0
he said the @entity8 government ‘ severely denounces such shameful acts and vows to find and prosecute the perpetrators ’			0
there are 1,214 @entity127 servicemen of the @entity160 buried or commemorated at the @entity16			1
of the 1,051 identified graves , 851 are @entity2			1
it also contains graves of @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity241 and @entity242 servicemen			1
religious hate : fanatics attack a @entity99 headstone one shattered headstone , broken into a dozen pieces , records the death of a @entity250 pilot , @entity249 , who was killed in october 1943			1
the cemetery is the last resting place for several soldiers from one of @entity2 ’s oldest regiments , the @entity256 , founded in 1775			1
four of the regiment ’s battalions took part in the @entity14 campaign and one of its members , rifleman @entity261 , was awarded the @entity201 after being killed while storming a @entity265 machine - gun post at the battle of @entity267 in november 1941			1
@entity268 , secretary of the regiment association , said : ‘ our 1,500 surviving members will find it difficult to cope with what has happened			1
all riflemen , regardless of their age or where they served , will be disgusted by these scenes			0
’ wrecked : extremists fetch a ladder to smash away at the war memorial next to the cemetery fury : extremists hack away at the monunent disrespect : a man smashes the cross with a hammer sad : a remnant of the cross lies smashed on the floor shattered : the memorial after it was attacked by the mob @entity291 , whose father , flight lieutenant @entity292 , is buried at @entity9 , said she was ‘ greatly saddened ’ by the attack			1
the @entity11 officer was 40 when he died in an aircraft crash near the city on february 3 , 1943			0
his daughter , who lives in @entity298 in the @entity299 , said : ‘ he was attached to a unit that set up broadcasting facilities and was sent out to @entity303 when @entity304 was there to make an important speech			0
on the way back to @entity9 , where he was based , my father ’s plane was brought down in the desert by a mechanical fault			0
the pilot was killed outright and one of the crew walked away			0
my father was badly injured and survived for a week			0
‘ i was concerned about what would happen to the cemetery all the time @entity4 was in power			0
i never visited because i was put off by the thought of him running the country			0
yet now this happens after his departure			0
’ a @entity127 spokesman promised that the cemetery would be restored ‘ to a standard befitting the sacrifice of those commemorated at @entity9 ’			0
but he added : ‘ this could take some time because we will need to source replacement stones			0
’ although the burning of the @entity75 was blamed for the desecration , others in the city believe it was also a perverse expression of deeper frustrations			0
the uprising that brought an end to @entity4 ’s 42 - year rule began in @entity9 , but many of the rebels there now feel left behind in the new @entity37			0
since the transitional government moved west to the capital @entity342 , they say they have been ignored and have suffered economic hardship			0
' he had a special aura ' : the top half of @entity348 's smashed memorial @entity348 at his wedding to @entity350 in 1940 it lies smashed in half and smeared with red earth from the boots of the men who stamped upon it			1
like the rest of the 1,200 plain white gravestones in @entity16 , it records only elementary details			0
it says that the reverend @entity211 , chaplain to the @entity362 , died on march 21 , 1941 , at the age of 30			0
and below this stark fact is a cross and the inscription : ‘ let light shine perpetually on him			0
’ but yesterday , traced by @entity141 , one of his surviving relatives recalled a cultivated , ‘ extraordinarily charismatic ’ man			0
@entity373 said : ‘ he was my mother ’s brother and a very wonderful man			0
‘ i was only a baby when he died but my mother absolutely adored him			0
she spoke of his special aura , a way he had of making everyone feel better about themselves			0
‘ i had a brother who died aged three and i know @entity192 counselled my mother afterwards and played a crucial role in getting her through her grief			0
’ mr @entity213 said his @entity386 - educated uncle – whose own father @entity387 was killed at the @entity388 in 1916 – was also held in affection by servicemen who greatly valued his pastoral care			1
when he married @entity392 in @entity393 in march 1940 , he was presented with a silver cigarette box by officers from 1st @entity396			0
his widow died in 1990			0
of the attack on the cemetery , mr @entity213 said : ‘ it is greatly upsetting , a disaster			1
