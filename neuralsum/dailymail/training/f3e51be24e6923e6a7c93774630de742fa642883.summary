by @entity0 last updated at 5:49 pm on 27th november 2011 @entity1 for @entity3 - speaking @entity2 will be led using the new translation of the @entity5 , which is intended to be closer to the @entity7 original @entity3 - speaking @entity2 may have noticed a little something different during their church services today as a new translation of the liturgy is introduced			1
for decades at the very beginning of @entity1 , the priest has greeted the congregation by saying ' the lord be with you ' and congregants responded : ' and also with you			2
' however starting today in the @entity3 - speaking world , the response has become : ' and with your spirit			1
' familiar prayers , both spoken and chanted , have also changed to contain new words like ' consubstantial ' and ' incarnate			2
in the @entity26 , which is recited during services , the affirmation ' we believe ' has been replaced with ' i believe ' the changes were agreed following a year - long process to produce an @entity3 translation that is closer to the original @entity7 - the text of prayers and instructions for celebrating @entity1 it is the most significant change to worship for @entity3 - speaking believers since the @entity37 in the 1960s , which was held at the @entity39 in @entity40 to address relations between the @entity2 and the modern world			1
an @entity3 - language missal was produced by 1973 , but that was intended to be temporary while improvements were made			1
in 2001 , the @entity39 office that oversees worship issued a directive requiring translation of the @entity3 missal that would be closer to the @entity7 rather than to more familiar vernacular speech			1
all change : services will all be held using the new translation of the @entity5 , which has become compulsory numerous revisions and bishops ' meetings eventually produced agreement on the translation being used this weekend			1
@entity60 's five million @entity2 have already been dealing with half of the new liturgy since september			1
however , the full translation has become compulsory as of today			1
monsignor @entity65 , pastor of @entity66 in @entity67 , @entity64 says he likes the new translation , but is aware of some priests and parishioners who have been less enthusiastic			1
critics say the new version is too laboured and in some cases have circulated petitions that called for a delay in introducing the new missal			2
mr @entity65 said : ' it 's human nature that we 're resistant to change			2
' i 'm old enough to remember when we went from @entity7 to @entity3 , and that was just a huge change			1
' parishes and dioceses around the @entity85 have spent months trying to prepare @entity2 for the change			1
priest : the lord be with you response : and also with you start of the @entity26 : ' we believe in one @entity92			2
' believe in : seen and unseen the relationship between @entity94 and the father : consubstantial to receive @entity1 : ' lord , i am not worthy to receive you			2
. priest : the lord be with you response : and with your spirit start of the @entity26 : ' i believe in one @entity92			2
’ believe in : visible and invisible			0
the relationship between @entity94 and the father : one in being to receive @entity1 : ' lord , i am not worthy that you should enter under my roof			0
' descriptions of the new translation have been printed in weekly bulletins , seminars have been held and since many parishes have been gradually introducing the new translation piece by piece , starting with the parts of the liturgy that are sung			1
' most of those activities are for the benefit of the average @entity121 , but it 's priests who have more new material to master			0
' i 've had a new missal in my hands for about three weeks now , and i 've been literally practicing the prayers			0
' i 've been doing this now for 31 years , and a lot of these prayers i actually know by memory			0
i have to make sure my brain is n't getting ahead of my mouth			0
' ' i 've been literally practicing the prayers ... a lot of these prayers i actually know by memory			0
i have to make sure my brain is n't getting ahead of my mouth			0
' the @entity2 of @entity139 in @entity140 , @entity138 had leaflets printed informing its parishioners of the changes			1
parishioner , @entity145 , of @entity146 , learnt @entity1 in @entity7 as a youngster told the @entity148 : ' i ’m 63 , so this is all going back to the old for me			0
' however , @entity151 , 50 , who attends services at the @entity154 also in @entity138 is n't keen on the changes			0
she said : ' hopefully , it ’ll bring more consciousness to the words we say when we ’re praying			0
' but there ’s something i do n’t like about making it uniform that prevents the unique cultural influences from each community that might be taken away			0
' @entity168 , 29 , who moved to @entity169 this year from @entity170 , where the changes have already taken place said : ' if you know your faith , then it ’s not really a big deal			0
' it ’s very close to the @entity121 culture and its origins , and it makes it more helpful in understanding it			0
