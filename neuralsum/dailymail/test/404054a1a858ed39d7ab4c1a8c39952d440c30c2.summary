a transgender woman who had her face horribly damaged after it was injected with cement and tire sealant stepped out on sunday showing off a new look			1
@entity5 was one of the victims of ' toxic tush ' doctor @entity7 , who performed illegal plastic surgeries using substances such as @entity11 , @entity12 and mineral oil			1
@entity5 had @entity7 inject her cheeks , lips and chin back in 2005 , and ended up disfigured after she did not have the money to go to a proper cosmetic surgeon			1
in a 2014 interview she said that her new look was helping to boost her self - esteem , and that men were taking notice			2
' recently this guy said that being with me is like being with a sexy dragon , ' she said at the time			1
' i did n't know whether to slap him or kiss him			2
' now , she has had her look improved once again by dr @entity24 and dr @entity25 , a process that will be featured on the premiere episode of @entity28			1
@entity5 , who was born in @entity49 but grew up in @entity50 , explained when she realized she was a woman in that 2014 interview			1
she explained ; ' up until i was in my mid-twenties i just thought i was a feminine gay male			2
i thought about all the things i did when i was growing up - like taking the basketball my dad had bought me and instead of playing basketball with it i was simulating pregnancy and actually pretending to give birth and be a mommy			2
' when i used to fantasize about being with guys i used to always picture myself with breasts and a vagina			0
i did n't realize i was doing it , it was just so natural for me			0
one day i just connected all the dots and thought " you 're not gay , you 're transgender			0
" ' @entity5 lived in solitude and was afraid to go out after her face was left disfigured ( above ) that all changed in 2012 when she began receiving free treatments from dr @entity30 @entity5 , who had been too ' embarrassed and ashamed ' to go to the authorities , claims she paid just $ 100 per session to @entity7 for the life - changing injections back in 2005			1
' the last thing i wanted was to look like a man in a dress			0
i wanted to be a beautiful woman , ' she said of her decision to get the injections			0
' if you really want to live your authentic self as a woman you need to do some sort of face and body reconstruction			1
' so i made the choice to get injections done			0
in our community it is called pumping			0
' and while she knew she was not seeing a licensed surgeon , she was still excited the day she went to see @entity7			1
' when it finally came to the day , i was more excited than nervous because i was finally going to be the woman i had always wanted to be , ' she said			0
' there was a room that she had set up where she did a lot of medical procedures			0
' the room looked sterile and clean she said , and sokn after she arrived they began the procedure			2
' i got injections in my face and my hips and my buttocks and initially i was fine , ' said @entity5			1
' but then the nightmare started			0
' ' the last thing i wanted was to look like a man in a dress			0
i wanted to be a beautiful woman , ' @entity5 ( above ) said of her decision to get the injections			1
@entity7 @entity7 ( above , file photo ) is accused of leaving women ill and disfigured after injecting them with a mixture of toxic substances , including super glue and @entity11 she was left with a large boil on her face that kept growing bigger and bigger , and then ' green pus exploded out of my face and onto the mirror			1
it was green and yellow and mixed with blood			0
' she ended up spending years in solitude as a result of these botched procedures , until dr @entity30 agreed to help her for free			2
because of him , she says she has gone from ' victim to victorious			0
' she is also ready to start dating again , saying ; ' i definitely deserve more than just the 3 o'clock in the morning knock on the window			0
' as for @entity7 , she is now facing manslaughter charges after one of her patients died following a procedure .			1
