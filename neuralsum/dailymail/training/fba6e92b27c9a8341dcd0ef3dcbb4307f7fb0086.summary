a woman has revealed how she visited her dying father in jail to tell him ' i love you ' after he was jailed for decades of horrifying abuse in which he treated her as his ' dutiful wife '			1
@entity9 , 46 , from @entity10 , was just six when her father @entity11 began abusing her , keeping her imprisoned in the family home			1
for years he beat her , shot her in the chest and forced her to undergo an agonising home abortion using a coat hanger			1
@entity9 pictured as a child with her father @entity11 , who began abusing her when she was six @entity9 visited her father in 2004 , days before he died of cancer			1
she felt ' love and compassion ' for her abuser @entity9 cooked and cleaned for her father after her mother left the family when she was just six			1
for years he subjected her to years of physical and sexual abuse , breaking her bones and even shooting her in the chest			1
finally the survivor , who now teaches others to overcome difficulty , fled to @entity10 and finally @entity31 where meeting her husband gave her the strength to bring her father to justice			1
even though the abuse started when she was very young , looking back at her early childhood , @entity9 has mixed memories			1
' most people have happy childhood memories			2
mine include my dad teaching me to swim and taking me for picnics			2
' but i have a lot of bad ones memories too			2
' when i was six and my dad taught me to box			2
i was only little but he expected me to fight him , even though it hurt me			2
; inspirational survivor @entity9 has found peace and now helps others achieve their dreams she was n't his only victim			2
' he was mean to my mum and called her useless and lazy and hit her , ' said @entity9			2
when she was six her mother left			2
she later returned , only to flee again when @entity9 was ten , leaving her at her father 's mercy			2
' each time she left he treated me like his dutiful wife , ' she said			2
@entity11 forced @entity9 to share his bed from the age of 11			1
' i should have been going to school			2
but he did n't let me			2
he said , " you have too much to do here "			2
' i had to stay home and look after my five kid siblings			1
i had to get up early to make breakfast for everyone , and pack their lunchboxes			2
' i was made to wash our clothes by hand , as we did n't have a machine			2
@entity74 won custody of his daughter in 1979 when she was 12 or 13 and he continued to bully her			2
' he threatened me with knives , ' she recalled			2
' the back - breaking housework left me feeling exhausted			2
by the evening i was always ready for bed - but my dad had other ideas			0
' he made me stay up with him until he wanted to go bed			0
he would then demand that i sleep in his room , and would force himself on me			0
' i was only a kid when he started to sexually assault and rape me			0
i was in such pain afterwards			0
he left me feeling confused and totally worthless			0
@entity9 , pictured as a teenager , her smile belies she endured throughout her childhood and beyond no one else know what @entity9 was going through			0
' my siblings never saw him do @entity96 did n't know i fell pregnant that year either as , fortunately for dad , i miscarried			1
' when she was 13 his violence left her with broken bones and he threatened to shoot her			0
' he told me i was evil and was n't worthy of his love , ' she said			1
' he said he had sacrificed having a life himself , to save me			0
' he told me : " if you do n't change i 'm going to have to kill you			1
" ' one day when i was 14 , he got angry and shot me in the chest			1
' a neighbour called an ambulance and doctors told her she could have died but @entity74 told them she had pulled the trigger herself			1
yet despite landing in hospital , @entity9 could n't rely on anyone to help her escape her living nightmare			0
she said : ' we kept moving house so we did n't have neighbours looking out for us , or my school			0
@entity117 forbade me to go so i did n't have friends to confide in			0
' he 'd force me to wait for him in his bed for when he got home from work			1
that same year , i fell pregnant a second time			1
' i wanted to keep the baby as i was incredibly lonely locked up all day			0
i hoped it would give me someone to talk to			0
' but dad could n't risk people knowing what he 'd done to me			1
' so he punched me in the stomach , made me take scolding hot baths , to try and end the pregnancy			0
' finally he carried out a home abortion using a coat hanger			1
' her husband @entity134 , who she met in @entity31 , finally helped her see the abuse was n't her fault two years later she had another abortion at a clinic			1
@entity74 gave @entity9 a script to recite to the doctors , declaring that a pretend boyfriend had made her pregnant			1
she said : ' later i apologised to dad for getting pregnant			1
i felt it was my fault			0
' finally when @entity9 was 20 she hatched a plan to escape			0
she contacted employment agencies to secure a job , got a credit card , packed her bags with clothes and a stone from a necklace her dad had bought her			0
she then escaped during the night , stayed in a @entity155 and next morning went to the airport to fly to @entity10 where she trained as an accountant			1
' i had realised if i did n't make a run for it or i might not get another chance , ' she said			0
yet even being in @entity10 was too close to her father so @entity9 moved to @entity31 where she met @entity134 , 46 , who she later married			1
he made her finally realise that she was n't to blame for how her father had treated her			0
thanks to his support and encouragement she finally worked up the courage to face her father in court			0
in october 2000 , @entity74 , then 55 , appeared at the @entity168 in @entity169			1
out of 30 charges , @entity74 admitted to three charges of rape and two of indecent exposure			0
@entity9 was face to face with her father for the first time in more than a decade			0
' there was n't a screen in the court room , and i looked straight at dad as i gave evidence , ' said mrs @entity9			0
with @entity134 's support ( left , with @entity9 ) , @entity9 had the courage to return to face her father and bring him to justice ' in a statement read out to the court , my dad had described our relationship as special			0
he 'd said , " we lived as husband and wife , so when my daughter left , my world fell apart "			1
' but justice @entity195 described the crimes ' as one of the worst cases of this nature he had ever heard			0
' @entity74 , of @entity200 , @entity201 , was jailed for 15 years			1
just four years into his sentence , in 2004 mrs @entity9 received a message from police saying her father was in a hospice with terminal lung cancer			1
so she decided to see him			0
' i realised i had to tell him i cared , ' she said			0
' i was grateful for everything he 'd taught me - how to swim , and be strong			1
i was scared at first but the fear soon melted away as i set eyes on dad who was ravaged by cancer and frail			0
' yet @entity74 had no idea of the pain and misery he 'd inflicted on his daughter			1
she continued : ' i hated seeing him suffer and he was pleased to see me			0
' he was confused about why i 'd reported him to police though			1
but it did n't upset me , or make me angry			0
i could n't judge him			0
' i told him , " i love you " and he said it back			1
' after he died i was sad			1
