@entity1 boss @entity0 has created a new answer to the @entity4 question of ' how do you eat yours ? ' - by turning the chocolate into a pie to serve with chips			1
eschewing the savoury favourites of sausage and egg or mince pies , mr @entity0 decided to wrap the @entity15 delicacies in pastry before they were battered and deep - fried			1
the result is his very own ' @entity18 oozing from the traditional pie casing which is then served with chips to more adventurous customers at a price of £ 2.75			0
the pie was created by blind - baking the casing as the egg would otherwise melt down , then one - and - a - half @entity26 were popped in as a filling			1
a lid is put on to seal the dish before the pie is battered and fried until golden , and if the timings are expertly observed , the chocolate will just begin to soften in the middle			1
mr @entity0 , who runs mr @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity33 , said : ' i love @entity15 and i love @entity26 but i thought it would be fun to try and put my own spin on them			1
' everyone has heard of battered @entity58 by now so i thought , " what would be the next step up ? " mr @entity0 rolls out the pie casing ( left ) before stuffing one and a half @entity26 into it ( right ) the pie is then covered with a lid and dipped in batter ( left ) before being quickly deep fried ( right ) ' @entity26 are just the right size and shape to be placed in a pie , so i thought ' why not ? ' ' it 's a laugh and i always like seeing what i can conjure up next for customers that might be seen as a bit strange or unusual			1

' his wife @entity78 added : ' they actually taste delicious and i do n't even like @entity81 ! ' the couple are no stranger to wacky food creations			0
last year , they created the world 's largest battered @entity86 which weighed a whopping 5kg and contained around 25,000 calories			2
mr @entity0 says his savoury - sweet mix is a hit with customers , who have taken to dipping chips into the @entity93 , much like traditional toast soldiers and while this particularly sweet - savoury offering may seem odd to some , mr @entity0 is n't the first to have added his own touch to @entity98			2
the @entity4 in a @entity99 a family butcher in the @entity102 borders has come up with a new way to eat the eggs - inside a scotch egg			1
@entity106 and @entity107 say their snack contains 1,000 calories - and is best served warm so the chocolate melts with the chilli - flavoured pork			0
@entity106 's @entity113 in the village of @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity102 , is now even planning to sell mini egg sausages to add to shop 's @entity15 offering			0
for just £ 1.85 you too could could enjoy the @entity4 surrounded by chilli flavoured sausage meat and covered in breadcrumbs			2
@entity124 explained : ' we always try to think up something new and exciting for the time of year - we try to get our thinking caps on			0
' the 36 - year - old continued : ' we came up with the sweet chilli in the sausage meat and the egg in the middle			0
