binge drinking as a teenager can cause long - lasting damage to the brain well into adulthood , a new study has warned			1
this is because drinking excessive amounts of alcohol when young can damage the brain and cause permanent changes to @entity11			1
this , in turn , can put teenagers at risk of anxiety disorders and alcoholism , researchers found			0
alcohol changes genes in brain cells , which stop the cells developing connections between them , altering behaviour , they said			1
however , they discovered a cancer drug may reverse the damage			1
binge drinking as a teenager can cause long - lasting damage into adulthood , putting young people at risk of anxiety disorders and alcoholism professor @entity33 , of the @entity34 , explained that binge drinking during the teenage years disrupts the brain 's normal development			1
he said : ' our study provides a mechanism for how binge - drinking during adolescence may lead to lasting changes that result in increased anxiety and alcoholism in adults			1
' intermittent alcohol exposure ' degrades the ability of the brain to form the connections it needs to during adolescence , he explained			1
' the brain does n't develop as it should , and there are lasting behavioural changes associated with this , ' he added			2
as part of the study , professor @entity33 and his team carried out lab experiments on 28 - day - old rats to investigate how alcohol would affect their brain development			2
they were given alcohol for two days on , then two days off , which was repeated over 13 days			0
rats exposed to alcohol showed changes in behaviour that lasted into adulthood , long after the exposure to alcohol ended			0
alcohol causes changes in the @entity11 in brain cells			1
however , researchers discovered a cancer drug may be able to reverse the changes they showed increased anxiety - like behaviours and drank more alcohol in adulthood			1
when brain tissue from the area of the brain called the amygdala was examined , rats given alcohol showed changes to their dna , known as epigenetic changes			0
professor @entity33 explained that epigenetic changes are chemical modifications of dna , or of the proteins around which @entity11 is wound , like thread on a spool			1
modification of these proteins , which are called histones , can change how loosely or tightly the dna is wound			0
many of us enjoy a chilled glass of wine or a cold beer after a hard day at work			0
but while the majority of people believe their drinking habits are under control , one in five young professionals now considers themselves to have a problem with alcohol , a survey found			2
a new poll laying bare the public 's attitudes to drinking found nearly half of young workers think it is acceptable to regularly get drunk on a night out , compared to a fifth of the general population			2
it also revealed the risky effects of drinking , as young people admitted to forgetting how they got home , driving themselves home drunk or getting in a car with someone they knew was intoxicated			2
genes that lie within @entity11 that is tightly wrapped around the histones are less active than if the dna is loosely wrapped			1
the looser the dna is coiled , the more accessible the genes are to the cellular machinery that ' expresses ' them			0
the rats exposed to alcohol had more tightly coiled @entity11			2
they also had increased levels of a protein called @entity138 , which modifies histones , causing dna to be wound tighter around them			0
these epigenetic changes were linked to lowered expression of a gene that nerve cells need in order to form new connections between cells , known as synaptic connections			1
professor @entity33 argued the lowered activity of this gene may be due to the tighter winding of its dna			0
the lower activity of the gene persisted in adulthood , even if alcohol exposure was stopped weeks before			0
the researchers also observed diminished connectivity between nerves in the amygdalae of these affected adult rats			0
but a cancer drug known to block the activity of @entity138 could be used to treat them , he said			1
in his experiments , the drug restored expression of the gene needed for synapse formation and the rats ' dna was observed to be less tightly coiled			0
the effect of this was that the rats exhibited less anxiety and reduced alcohol intake			0
professor @entity33 added : ' we are n't sure if the drug needs to be given long term during adulthood in order to completely reverse the harmful effects of adolescent alcohol exposure			2
' the findings were reported online in the journal @entity187 .			0

binge drinking when young can cause changes in @entity11 in brain cells
the changes mean connections do not form as normal between the cells
this alters the way genes are expressed and changes behaviour
however , experts discovered a cancer drug can reverse the changes
