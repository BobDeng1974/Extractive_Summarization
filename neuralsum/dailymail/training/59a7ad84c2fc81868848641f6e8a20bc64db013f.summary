it has baffled astronomers for years - just what causes the ' red spot ' on the surface of @entity5 ? now they have an unlikely answer - sunburn			2
@entity8 experts believe it is likely a product of simple chemicals being broken apart by sunlight in the planet 's upper atmosphere			1
experts believe the ' spot ' is a product of simple chemicals being broken apart by sunlight in the planet 's upper atmosphere			1
in the lab , the researchers blasted ammonia and acetylene gases - chemicals known to exist on @entity5 - with ultraviolet light , to simulate the sun 's effects on these materials at the extreme heights of clouds in the @entity29			1
this produced a reddish material , which the team compared to the @entity29 as observed by @entity34 's @entity33 ( @entity33 )			1
the results contradict the other leading theory for the origin of the spot 's striking color - that the reddish chemicals come from beneath @entity5 's clouds			1
' our models suggest most of the @entity29 is actually pretty bland in color , beneath the upper cloud layer of reddish material , ' said @entity47 , a @entity34 team scientist based at @entity8 's @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50			1
' under the reddish ' sunburn ' the clouds are probably whitish or grayish			1
' @entity47 and @entity48 colleagues @entity55 and @entity56 arrived at their conclusions using a combination of data from @entity34 's december 2000 @entity5 flyby and laboratory experiments			0

they found that the light - scattering properties of their red concoction nicely matched a model of the @entity29 in which the red - colored material is confined to the uppermost reaches of the giant cyclone - like feature			1
a coloring agent confined to the top of the clouds would be inconsistent with the competing theory , which posits that the spot 's red color is due to upwelling chemicals formed deep beneath the visible cloud layers , he said			1

the spot is actually a violent storm			0
the biggest in the solar system , it appears as a deep red orb surrounded by layers of pale yellow , orange and white			0
winds inside the storm have been measured at several hundreds of miles per hour , @entity8 astronomers said			0
if red material were being transported from below , it should be present at other altitudes as well , which would make the red spot redder still			0
@entity5 is composed almost entirely of hydrogen and helium , with just a sprinkling of other elements			0
scientists are interested in understanding what combinations of elements are responsible for the hues seen in @entity5 's clouds , as this would provide insights into the giant planet 's make - up			2
@entity5 possesses three main cloud layers , which occupy specific altitudes in its skies ; from highest to lowest they are : ammonia , ammonium hydrosulfide and water clouds			2
as for why the intense red color is seen only in the @entity29 and a few much smaller spots on the planet , the researchers think altitude plays a key role			1
' @entity137 is extremely tall , ' @entity47 said			0
' it reaches much higher altitudes than clouds elsewhere on @entity5			2
' the team thinks the spot 's great heights both enable and enhance the reddening			0
its winds transport ammonia ice particles higher into the atmosphere than usual , where they are exposed to much more of the sun 's ultraviolet light			0
in addition , the vortex nature of the spot confines particles , preventing them from escaping			0
this causes the redness of the spot 's cloud tops to increase beyond what might otherwise be expected			0
other areas of @entity5 display a mixed palette of oranges , browns and even shades of red			0
@entity47 says these are places where high , bright clouds are known to be much thinner , allowing views to depths in the atmosphere where more colorful substances exist .			2
