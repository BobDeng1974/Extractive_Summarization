by @entity0 for @entity1 from dangerous driving conditions to slimy clothes and a frizzy hair - do - nobody enjoys cycling in the rain			1
but now intrepid cyclists can keep dry using an umbrella that has been specially designed to clip onto bikes			0
a @entity11 firm based in @entity12 has invented a simple clamp that fits a bike ’s handlebars and holds a windproof umbrella firmly in place to protect a rider from wind and rain			1
easy rider : a @entity11 firm based in @entity12 has invented a simple clamp that fits to a bike ’s handlebars and holds a windproof umbrella firmly in place to protect a rider from wind and rain ( pictured ) the holder can also be used to store the umbrella when the rain stops too			1
the umbrella 's asymmetric design is said to help it withstand high speed wind gusts of up to 70mph ( 113kph )			2
the aerodynamic design directs wind over and around the brolly , which holds its shape and keeps people dry underneath			2
streamlined : the holder ( pictured left ) it works with the umbrella which has an asymmetric design said to help it withstand high speed wind gusts of up to 70mph ( 113kph )			0
the device is pictured in action ( right ) good for gusts : the aerodynamic design of the umbrella ( pictured ) directs wind over and around the brolly , which holds its shape			1
it is sold separately to the holder ( also pictured ) as an increasing number of people cycle in cities , new bikes and add - ons have been developed to make life easier			0
last week , a new bike was unveiled that has handlebars that can be used as a bike lock			0
the @entity68 bike lots of safety features , an automatic gear shifter , built - in lights and a motor to help cyclists up hills			0
a @entity76 - based company named @entity77 showcased a safety feature called @entity79 , which projects an icon onto the road , helping to ensure that drivers are aware of an approaching cyclist , even if they can not see them			0
a green image of a bike is beamed between 16 and 19ft ( five and six metres ) in front of a cyclist , signalling that a driver should not turn across their path			0
while its makers , @entity94 , cautions against riding in high winds , the umbrella design lends itself to coping with the air stream created by cycling			1
a spokesperson for the @entity11 firm said : ‘ ruining your hairdo , ending up with dripping clothes after a quick ride to the shops will be a thing of the past with the @entity108 umbrella holder			2
‘ the clamp allows you to attach your umbrella on your bike , while keeping both hands on the handle bars and giving a good sight of traffic			2
‘ when it is not raining the holder is easily folded back and the brolly attached to the bike forks			0
’ the clamp costs € 39 ( £ 31 ) while the umbrellas come in different sizes and are sold separately for € 25 ( £ 20 ) and € 50 ( £ 40 )			1
the aerodynamic and wind - resistant umbrella was invented by engineering student @entity124 after storms broke three of his standard umbrellas in a week			0
a protective shield : while the umbrella and clamp 's makers , @entity94 , cautions against riding in high winds , the umbrella design lends itself to coping with the airstream created by cycling no more wet clothes for £ 30 : ‘ the clamp allows you to attach your umbrella on your bike , while keeping both hands on the handle bars and giving a good sight of traffic , ' the firm said			1
the clamp ( pictured ) costs € 39 ( £ 31 ) and is sold separately to the umbrella			1

€ 39 ( £ 31 ) clamp was created by a company in @entity12 , @entity11
it fixes to a bike 's handlebars and holds an aerodynamic umbrella
together , the two devices can protect a cyclist in strong winds and rain
umbrella design lends itself to coping with the air stream created by cycling
