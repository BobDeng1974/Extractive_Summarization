by @entity0 published : 11:09 est , 25 september 2012 updated : 18:36 est , 25 september 2012 wealthy pensioners should be stripped of universal benefits such as free bus passes , @entity1 suggested yesterday			1
anyone with assets of more than £ 1million could lose out on payments including the winter fuel allowance and free tv licences			0
the deputy prime minister insisted age - related payments would be protected for the duration of this @entity13			0
but he indicated they could be curbed afterwards			0
idea : @entity1 , pictured with his wife @entity16 yesterday in @entity17 , said wealthy pensioners should be stripped of universal benefits such as free bus passes mr @entity1 said the welfare budget could not be ‘ immune ’ from the swingeing cuts aimed at reducing @entity21 ’s budget deficit			1
the controversial plans are expected to be included in the @entity24 manifesto at the next general election , due in 2015			2
but some senior @entity24 are calling for them to come sooner			0
mr @entity1 ’s comments follow demands for a £ 2million ‘ mansion tax ’ for the ‘ stinking rich ’ and chief secretary to the treasury @entity30 ’s warning that the government would go after tax dodgers			0
@entity34 promised to retain free bus passes during the live television debates between the party leaders before the last election			1
but work and pensions secretary @entity38 wants an end to universal benefits for the elderly to help shave £ 10billion from the welfare budget			2
mr @entity1 said it would be ‘ very difficult to explain ’ if low earners lost state help while better - off pensioners continued to receive universal benefits			1
middle class parents are already due to lose their child benefit payments next year			0
proposal : work and pensions secretary @entity38 wants an end to universal benefits for the elderly to help shave £ 10billion from the welfare budget ‘ it would be quite interesting if you could ask the @entity57 for this , because they appear to be saying that at a time when people ’s housing benefit is being cut , we should protect @entity64 ’s free bus pass , ’ mr @entity1 told @entity54			1
he said that the @entity65 ruled out changing age - related universal benefits , but that would change ‘ in the future ’			2
' the @entity57 appear to be saying that at a time when people ’s housing benefit is being cut , we should protect @entity64 ’s free bus pass ' @entity1 , deputy pm but one of his ministers called for cuts to be made immediately			1
local government minister @entity24 told @entity74 : ‘ it ’s not yet @entity24 policy , it ’s something we ’ll work on			2
but you know , if there is something that can be done now then we need to get the economy moving now , not just put it in a @entity24 manifesto for 2015			0
‘ if we can get something like this implemented now then that would be better			0
’ former @entity88 spokesman @entity87 added that mr @entity34 should take a ‘ hit ’ by axing universal benefits for the elderly			1
unhappy : @entity1 said it would be difficult to defend the state giving a free bus pass to wealthy pensioners like businessman and tv star @entity64 he said : ‘ i ’ve been raising these questions about winter fuel payments going to people who do n’t need them , whether they are sipping @entity101 in the sun in @entity103 or people like me in their 60s with good jobs : why at least should these not be taxed ? ' if you start means - testing pensioner benefits , many of those who need help will not get it , as they wo n’t claim , it will cost huge sums in administration and you will be penalising those who have saved ' @entity117 , @entity118 ‘ @entity1 has bravely taken hits for the @entity65 team on tuition fees and the @entity122 , for example , why on earth ca n’t @entity34 at least accept that if we ’re all in it together , rich pensioners in good jobs should take the hit too ? why are n’t we fighting for fairness on well - off pensioners ’ perks now rather than waiting for 2015 ? ’ but @entity117 , of @entity118 , warned : ‘ if you start means - testing pensioner benefits , many of those who need help will not get it , as they wo n’t claim , it will cost huge sums in administration and you will be penalising those who have saved			1
’ later mr @entity1 shot down mr @entity24 ’s calls for the change to happen before 2015			2
he said : ‘ he ’s wrong and it ’s not going to happen in this @entity13 , and i can not stress enough that what i mean is people , who are very wealthy indeed , receive off millions of ordinary taxpayers across this country free bus passes , tv licences and winter fuel support ; even though they frankly do n’t need it			1
’ fight : @entity1 , who yesterday visited the @entity151 in @entity17 , is preparing to do battle with the @entity153 over cuts to the welfare bill last night lord @entity156 , 65 , hit back at mr @entity1 ’s comments – saying he did n’t even have a bus pass and that mr @entity1 was an ‘ idiot ’ and a ‘ twit ’			1
even if i did have a bus pass , i ’ve personally paid tens of millions in tax , my companies hundreds of millions in the past 45 years			0

i have n’t got one			0
even if i did have a bus pass , i ’ve personally paid tens of millions in tax , my companies hundreds of millions in the past 45 years			0
’ the attack on universal benefits is the @entity24 ’ latest plan to target wealthy @entity21			2
