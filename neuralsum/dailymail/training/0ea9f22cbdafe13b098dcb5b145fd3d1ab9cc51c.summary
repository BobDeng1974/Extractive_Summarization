@entity0 will continue to fret over the physical condition of his trio of centre - forwards as he plots for sunday ’s game at @entity5			1
@entity7 did not train on wednesday , @entity6 is operating at less than 100 per cent and @entity8 came off against @entity9 on tuesday with a groin problem , although he refuses to rule himself out of the game at @entity12			1
' i do n’t think it ’s too bad , ' said @entity8			1
' i felt something in my groin			2
fortunately i stopped playing because i felt something			0
it was a bit stiff			0
that ’s why i prefer to come off			0
@entity8 scored the opener against @entity9 on tuesday night but was promptly replaced by @entity6 the @entity21 limped off after injuring his groin but remains confident he will be fit to face @entity5 ' i have to care about myself and if i ’m not feeling very good it ’s better to leave for another player who is 100 per cent			1
it is frustrating because @entity7 is injured but i am not afraid			1
i do n’t think it is really bad			0
i really hope to play again this weekend			0
' @entity8 went for a scan on wednesday but @entity0 has told his players he wants no injury news to leak out ahead of the game at @entity5			1
he claims @entity7 has ' very little chance ' but some will suspect kidology at play from the @entity36 manager			2
without @entity7 and @entity8 , @entity0 is likely to turn to @entity6 , his 36 - year - old warhorse , just back from an ankle injury and not in condition to play 90 minutes			1
@entity7 missed training on wednesday and is a major doubt for the trip to @entity12 this weekend @entity6 , in action against @entity9 on tuesday , is operating at less than 100 per cent @entity44 suggests @entity7 will miss @entity5 game ' i need time , ' said @entity6			1
' before signing , i did n’t play for two or three months and then i had this injury			0
but i ’m training hard to be back to full fitness			0
i ’m not fit yet but these games will help me improve			0
' it ’s up to the manager to decide who starts , but if you ’re a player how would you feel if they say you can play at @entity12 ? you ’ll be happy			2
to be able to enjoy these kind of moments is fantastic			0
we are lucky and if i play i will feel lucky one more time			0
' @entity59 who played at centre - forward for @entity36 at @entity12 last year is ready to return after a virus and teenager @entity62 is expected to keep his place in the squad			2
@entity0 , pictured out shopping on wednesday , is sweating over the fitness of his strike trio			1
