they were undoubtedly the main attraction			0
two rays of @entity4 sunshine to pierce the gloom of a freezing january afternoon in @entity6 , two dashes of spice sprinkled on the already - tasty dish of @entity10 versus @entity11			1
in the blue corner , @entity13 of @entity14			1
back in business , fit again and firing after injury and hotly - fancied to add to his 19 goal tally for the season so far			0
in the red corner ( well yellow and blue ) , @entity21 of @entity22			2
a Â£ 30m man who has paid back his hefty transfer fee already ; exceeding even the loftiest of pre-season expectations with his 18 goals , copious assists and a seldom - found and whole - hearted desire to play in every single game			2
@entity21 hurdles the challenge of @entity33 during his bravura first - half performance the sight of @entity21 surrounded by @entity10 players became a familiar one as he controlled the first - half @entity10 's @entity13 , by contrast , was struggling to impose himself on the game @entity13 attempts to close down @entity11 defender @entity41 as @entity10 seek a route back into proceedings @entity13 and @entity21 were worth the admission money alone at the @entity45 - they belong to that magical category of players who make impressionable young fans fall in love with the game			1
but in the first - half just one of the pair made any impression			1
the opening 45 minutes was a collector 's item in itself - a modern @entity11 team travelling away to one of the big teams and dominating proceedings			1
goalkeeper @entity63 was redundant , quite incredibly , as @entity11 controlled the game and , better yet , gained the lead through a @entity67 penalty after @entity68 was brought down - how easily is another debate - by @entity69			1
but that seemed to be the only moment when @entity21 was n't involved			2
the @entity22 was holding the baton , conducting the orchestra and yet also playing some solos of his own			0
@entity21 ( right ) gets involved in the celebrations with @entity78 and @entity67 after the first goal @entity13 ( left ) cuts a frustrated figure after @entity78 doubles @entity11 's advantage at the @entity45 @entity21 was picking passes at will , dictating the pace and direction of the game in the first - half the result leaves @entity10 five points behind @entity89 in the @entity91 title race @entity92 had been assigned the task of minder			1
early on , @entity21 played the role of little silver ball to pinball machine bumper			2
on six minutes , he showed immaculate chest control to bring an @entity11 move infield but the @entity100 snatched the ball			2
@entity21 would have to be persistent			2
he mainly occupied the open acres on the left but willingly drove inside			0
at one point , he thrillingly squeezed between two blue shirts only to be swallowed by four more on the edge of the box			0
as has so often been shown this season , @entity21 is indefatigable			2
one minute he was performing defensive duties , dispossessing @entity111 and knocking it out for a throw , the next he was charging down @entity33 as he hacked clear			0
as @entity11 sat back a little more following @entity67 's penalty , @entity21 refused to follow suit but his forward charges increasingly led down blind alleys			1
@entity92 started to take control and perhaps the @entity22 might have dropped back more to help the increasingly - stretched back line			0
but what of @entity13 ? frankly , he was anonymous			2
for a side who found themselves five points behind leaders @entity89 after saturday 's action , they had surprisingly little impetus			0
on 34 minutes , the @entity14 positioned his body to win a corner - set - pieces were pretty much their only threat in the first - half - but it was his first contribution in about 25 minutes			1
ironically , the corner was headed away by , you 've guessed it , @entity21			2
the first - half heat map for @entity21 shows how he gravitated to the left side to orchestrate attacks @entity13 , by contrast , was starved of touches in the @entity11 box during a quiet first - half the start of the second - half suggested the tide was turning			1
@entity10 started brightly , pressed incessantly and looked like scoring at last			0
@entity13 set the tone , cutting inside from the right , onto his left foot , before forcing a fingertip save from @entity151			2
all of a sudden , he was everywhere , the touchpaper lit. he tried to shoot with the outside of his right boot but it sliced away from goal as unmarked team - mates glared at him			0
@entity21 just was n't in the game , his ball - carrying instinct nullified as @entity11 struggled to gain the ball			1
then , out of nowhere , a sucker punch			0
@entity163 was caught napping , @entity67 pinched the ball and @entity78 headed home for 2 - 0			1
as the @entity11 players celebrated with knee slides in front of their delirious fans , @entity21 greeted the goal with a high - pitched screech			1
it obviously meant a lot			0
in all honesty , @entity67 was overshadowing everyone			0
the man known as the ' @entity177 ' was outstanding , the best on the park			0
his execution of the first - half penalty was perfect , his cross for the second unstoppable			1
like @entity21 , he drove @entity11 on - probably more often			1
you lost count of the number of times the @entity187 was visible on the back , streaking away into space			0
while @entity21 was impressive , it was @entity67 who made more of a difference for @entity11 @entity67 dispatches his first - half penalty past the outstretched @entity194 to give @entity11 the lead his touch was assured , his energy limitless , his creativity infinite			1
still , despite his efforts , you sensed a big finale was in store			0
@entity13 's partner - in - crime , @entity204 was introduced from the bench			1
@entity21 exited the stage with seven minutes left , replaced by @entity208 as @entity11 shored up the barricades			1
the travelling fans applauded warmly , it had been another excellent performance by their star signing from the summer			0
moments later , @entity13 raced 60 yards to catch up with @entity208 as he sprinted clear down the left			0
the striker pulled back his shirt and earned a booking			0
the effort was admirable but it kind of summed up his afternoon			0
the late onslaught never came , this was a poor @entity10 display			0
the @entity45 was half - empty long before the end as a massive blow in the title race was dealt			1
@entity21 had well and truly got the better of @entity13 in the battle of the @entity4			2
@entity224 greets @entity21 after he is replaced by @entity208 late in the game @entity21 's heat map for the whole 90 minutes shows how he was forced to backtrack more after half - time @entity13 had more influence in the second - half but was unable to conjure a goal for @entity10			1

@entity10 vs @entity11 was billed as clash of @entity21 and @entity13 at the @entity45
@entity21 pulled the strings for the *visitors* in the first - half
but @entity13 was anonymous as @entity10 struggled to impose themselves
the @entity14 improved after the break as @entity21 faded a little
both were overshadowed by @entity67 , the game 's best player
he *converted* a first - half penalty and set up @entity78 for second
