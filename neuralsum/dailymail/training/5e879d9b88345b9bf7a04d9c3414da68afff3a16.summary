soldiers from @entity2 countries have been banned from joining @entity4 ’s @entity3 unless they have lived here for five years			1
the residency test , which came into force yesterday , will prevent overseas recruits joining immediately as they do now			1
the @entity9 reinstated the requirement , which was scrapped in 1998 , as it attempts to reduce the size of the military by nearly 30,000 troops			1
cutbacks : @entity2 citizens will be require to have lived in @entity4 for five years before they are eligible to join the @entity3 recruits from @entity2 countries have a long and distinguished history of serving in the @entity3			1
in the @entity20 , 1.2million men from the @entity19 fought alongside the @entity21 with 74,000 losing their lives			1
@entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , and @entity27 all lent troops during @entity29			2
and @entity4 's @entity2 companions have proved to be brave in the battlefield			2
@entity32 , pictured above , originally from @entity33 , was awarded the @entity34 for his valour while serving in @entity36			2
others to have been given the highest military honour include two @entity24 @entity39 and @entity40 for their actions in the @entity42			2
but the controversial move could lead to accusations of betrayal because @entity2 troops have shed blood for the @entity4 on the battlefields of @entity36 and @entity49 – as well as in previous conflicts such as the two world wars			2
in the past decade 24 @entity2 soldiers have been killed in conflict			0
dozens more have been wounded			0
if the rules had been in place when sergeant @entity32 arrived in @entity4 from the @entity58 island of @entity33 in 1999 , he would not have been permitted to join the @entity19 in 2001			0
and the soldier , who serves with the @entity60 the @entity61 , would not have been on the @entity36 battlefield in 2004 , when he won the @entity34 for twice saving comrades in ambushes			0
typically , 500 @entity2 soldiers are among the 7,000 new recruits each year and the residency rule could leave the @entity3 perilously overstretched if they failed to recruit enough @entity4 soldiers			1
throughout the infantry , about one in ten soldiers is from outside @entity4			0
many join units that fail to recruit their full complement of soldiers at home			0
but armed forces minister @entity76 said the rule was unavoidable as the military coped with sweeping cuts			1
in a written ministerial statement he acknowledged the contribution of @entity2 citizens serving in the @entity83			0
but he added : ‘ in order to deliver the future structure of the @entity3 under the requirements of the @entity88 , we are already reducing their size by adjusting our recruit intake and making some redundancies			1
‘ we are confident that we will still be able to meet our recruitment targets			0
’ change : the ruling had been scrapped in 1998 but is now being reinstated , effective immediately the changes will not affect @entity96 or those from the @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100			1
@entity102 defence spokesman @entity101 said : ‘ when rightly recruiting those from the @entity4 , ministers must never undermine the many sacrifices and commitments made by those from the @entity2 who have served on frontlines across the globe in the name of @entity4 national security			1
‘ the country will want to know this is based on the best possible military advice and nothing else			0
’ colonel @entity113 , who commanded @entity4 forces in @entity49 , praised the long tradition of ‘ sterling service ’ that @entity2 soldiers have provided – ‘ and still provide ’ – in the @entity19			0
he said the @entity3 had ‘ depended heavily ’ on @entity2 troops to bring units up to strength and accused the @entity9 of using ineffective recruiting techniques			1
but he added : ‘ however , at a time when our armed forces are reducing to the lowest levels in more than a century , it is right that priority should be given to @entity4 citizens			0
’ an @entity9 spokesman said : ‘ at a time when we are having to reduce the size of our armed forces , it is only right we focus on recruiting @entity4 personnel			0
