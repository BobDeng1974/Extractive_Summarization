by @entity0 flood predictions could be made far more accurate by analysing satellite data , it has been claimed			1
researchers say they could have predicted floods five months in advance using the technique			2
the team tested their theory on the 2011 @entity10 floods - and found it could have given five months warning			1
@entity10 flooding in 2011 : researchers say they can predict floods five months in advance using the satellite technique			1
researchers measured how much water was stored in a river basin months ahead of the spring flood season , and factored it into predictions			1
a case study of the catastrophic 2011 @entity10 floods showed that factoring into hydrologic models the total water storage information from @entity25 ’s @entity27 mission – including groundwater accumulation below the surface – could have increased regional flood warning lead times from two months to as long as five months			1
@entity33 underground measurements are not currently part of predictive models , which typically take into account river flow rates and some snowfall amounts			0
the @entity39 research was published online sunday in the journal @entity41			0
researchers measured how much water was stored in a river basin months ahead of the spring flood season			2
the use of such data , which capture a much fuller picture of how water is accumulating , could result in earlier flood warnings , potentially saving lives and property , researchers said			2

a review of the 2011 @entity61 floods found that warnings could have been issued three months before they occurred			1

' grace data contain important hydrologic information that is not currently being utilized to estimate regional flood potential , ' said lead author @entity70 , who did the work as a @entity39 postdoctoral researcher and recently joined @entity25 ’s @entity73 as a research scientist			2
' this could significantly increase flood prediction lead times within large river basins			0
' the 2011 @entity10 floods lasted for months , closing interstates , shutting down nuclear plants and scouring farmland			1
@entity83 flooding causes an average of 133 deaths and $ 4 billion in property losses per year in the @entity87 , according to the @entity88			0
earlier flood predictions could help water managers better plan for possible water diversion and evacuation strategies			2
the two grace satellites provide a means to observe monthly variations in total water storage within large river basins based on measurements of tiny changes in @entity101 ’s gravitational field : when the amount of water stored in a region increases , the gravitational pull from that area increases proportionately – which the satellites can detect			0
' these data can show us when river basins have been filling with water over several months , ” said senior author @entity110 , a @entity39 @entity101 system scientist who ’s on leave to be @entity73 ’s senior water scientist			0
' we ’re not talking about actual flooding but about the saturation level of the ground and its predisposition to flooding			0
' when it finally rains and the basin is full , there is nowhere else for the water to go			0
