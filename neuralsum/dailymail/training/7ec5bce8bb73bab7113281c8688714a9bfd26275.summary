by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 blitzed first practice ahead of the @entity5 @entity4 as he set his sights on again reeling in @entity8 team - mate @entity7 in the battle for the formula one world title			1
unusually , there was no @entity8 lock out of the top two places as instead @entity2 spearheaded a @entity13 one - two , with @entity16 's @entity15 second on the timesheet around one of the sport 's historic tracks , @entity21			1
@entity2 , though , was in a class of his own as he finished 0.623secs ahead of @entity15 , with @entity7 forced to settle for only third best , with the @entity26 0.808secs down			1
despite apologising and paying a significant six - figure fine handed down by @entity8 , @entity7 still emerged from the event with a further 18 points more than @entity2 , and is now 29 ahead in the standings			1
that has placed additional pressure on @entity2 to enjoy a clean weekend , something that has eluded him for some considerable time			1
at least his time of one minute 26.187secs laid down a marker he means business this weekend			2
@entity53 's @entity52 also managed to finish within a second of @entity2 , lapping 0.982secs off the pace			1
