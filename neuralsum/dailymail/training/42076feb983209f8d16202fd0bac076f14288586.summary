by @entity0 published : 12:34 est , 7 june 2013 updated : 04:26 est , 10 june 2013 this week it 's one hundred years since @entity2 died at @entity3 becoming a martyr for the cause of women 's rights			1
while her name , and that of @entity11 founder @entity10 , have gone down in history , there are countless other women who fought for the cause who have since been forgotten			1
without the spirit and actions of these brave females , @entity19 women today would n't enjoy many of the freedoms they now take for granted - from being able to vote , to being able to wear what they want			1
hundred year anniversary : @entity2 became a martyr for the cause of women 's rights after she died from injuries sustained at @entity3 votes for women : as the founder of the @entity11 , @entity10 's name has also gone down in history but her great - granddaughter said the efforts of other women should not be forgotten now author @entity35 is giving these women a voice again with her new book ' march , women , march '			1
the books tells the story of the women 's movement in @entity19 from the publication of @entity45 's @entity44 to them finally getting equal voting rights with men in 1928			0
dr @entity49 , great - granddaughter of @entity10 , provides a foreword to the book in which she calls for the women 's movement to be remembered beyond her own family 's contribution			1
she writes : ' too often nowadays , the complexity and multi-dimensional aspect of the mid-victorian and @entity57 women ’s movement in the @entity19 is boxed into a few iconic images and words			0
high up on the list are the @entity61 , “ @entity65 , white and green ” , the @entity62 , militancy and the ' @entity64 '			0
influencing fashion : models @entity67 and @entity69 championed for the loose - fitting , long flowing dresses they were painted in by artists like @entity73 to become acceptable wear fashion statement : the @entity76 campaigned for women to wear clothing , like that shown in this engraving from 1882 , that freed women from the painful constraints of corsets and cages who knew ? the @entity87 coined the term ' suffragette ' to distinguish the militant @entity11 activists from the more genteel suffragists of the @entity92 ' these words and images have been absorbed into the @entity19 psyche and collective memory - they define , but in doing so , they also shrink the women ’s rights movement			1
there were so many other women who pioneered a whole raft of social , political and economic changes and who are now largely forgotten			2
we need to remember them			0
' dr @entity10 calls on women such as @entity106 - who staged the first hunger strike that was to become a trademark action for the suffragettes - and @entity67 - who campaigned for women to be able to wear comfortable clothing - to be remembered			1
ms @entity35 explains their contribution to the women 's movement , as well as many others who have since become a footnote in history , in her book			2
fight : suffragettes endured hunger strikes and force feeding to enable women today to have many of the rights they now take for granted deeds not words : @entity10 is arrested outside @entity126 during a demonstration in 1914 long - term health consequences : some of the women who were force fed in prison suffered for years to come @entity132 : @entity106 was the first to go on hunger strike @entity67 was a model for the famous @entity136 painters but she had brains as well as beauty			1
along with other women such as @entity141 's @entity140 who shocked @entity142 by wearing trousers ( but did n't actually invent bloomers that were given her name ) , she campaigned for women to be able to cast off the restrictive national dress of corsets			2
@entity67 and @entity69 championed the loose - fitting , long flowing dresses they were painted in by artists like @entity73			1
ms @entity35 writes : ' both women made their own clothes and were influential in creating a style commonly known as @entity136			0
' she adds that in @entity158 society , this style of dress was seen as ' shocking and unseemly ' but the women were unrepentant in what they wore - despite often being sneered at by corset - wearing women			2
in 1881 , the ' @entity162 ' was formed in @entity163 protesting against : ' any fashion in dress that either deforms the figure , impeded movement of body or in any way tends to injury health			0
' as medical studies began to prove that corsets could intend damage internal organs , the cage crinoline , the bustle and the corset began to fall out of fashion and was no longer required wear for women			2
in the early 20th century , the women 's movement really began to move a pace as the @entity11 began using militant tactics to get noticed including attacking both politicians and property			0
as the women began to be imprisoned for their actions , the hunger strikes - for which the suffragettes became synonymous - were born			1
the suffering of the women who went on hunger strike and were painfully force - fed is well - known but perhaps little known is the women who started it all			1
the artist @entity106 was the first to go on hunger strike after she was arrested for ' wilful damage ' in 1909 for attaching a ' bill of rights ' to a wall in the palace of @entity202			1
ms @entity35 writes : ' although the @entity11 had not known beforehand that @entity106 would start this form of protest , the union rapidly adopted it as its own			2
' fight for justice : @entity35 's book chronicles the women 's rights movement the book relates in shocking detail the degrading and painful form the force - feeding took for the women on hunger strikes with many suffering from long - term health problems as a result			1
but suffragette @entity218 summed up the feeling after she was released from prison for disrupting an election rally			0
' they have not tamed us , ' she said			0
' we have more fire in us than ever before			0
' in her book , ms @entity35 fully explores the impact the @entity62 and @entity2 had on the progress of women 's rights but she also writes about lesser known heroic figures who fought social and political injustice			1
for instance , writer @entity232 fought the legal system to obtain a divorce from her abusive husband - and in doing so changed for the better the laws that govern divorce and child custody today			0
she was instrumental in the passing of the @entity241 , the @entity242 and the @entity243 ; she also helped to change the laws governing working women ’s rights			0
meanwhile , feisty widow @entity245 fought not only the archaic laws concerning the guardianship of children , but also began the hugely successful campaign : ‘ no taxation without representation ’			0
dr @entity10 sums up the impact all these women made in her foreword			0
she writes : ' the determination of a few and the persistent support of the many , despite huge setbacks , slowly but surely , led to a transformed @entity19 landscape in which “ liberty and justice ” became more than just a dream			0
