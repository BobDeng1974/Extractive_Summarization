by @entity0 a newly - opened apartment building on the outskirts of @entity3 has stringent rules banning smoking , perfume and mobile phones in a bid to provide a haven for those hypersensitive to everyday chemicals			1
the structure has been purpose - built for people who say exposure to everyday products such as perfume , hand lotion or wireless devices make them so sick they can not function			1
' i have been suffering since i was a child			2
this will really move my life in another direction , ' said @entity23 , the 59 - year - old head of the @entity24 and @entity25 , the organisation behind the project			2
sterile : a new apartment building in @entity3 does not allow smoking , mobile phones or perfume to cater to those hypersensitive to everyday chemicals refuge : the project aims to make daily lives more comfortable for people whose conditions have often left them isolated and unable to hold jobs @entity23 and the other residents suffer from @entity40 ( @entity40 ) , a chronic condition not broadly recognised by the medical community			1
those afflicted , however , believe it is sparked by low - level exposure to chemicals in things such as cigarette smoke , pesticides , scented products and paint fumes			1
twelve of the 15 apartments in the earth - coloured building in a remote part of @entity56 , on the outskirts of @entity59 's largest city , have already been rented since it opened in december			0
many occupants also suffer from electromagnetic hypersensitivity , in which electrical circuits and radiation from wireless equipment make them equally ill. ' it makes me weak , anxious , i ca n't breath , my lungs hurt , and i get dizzy , ' says @entity23 , who suffers from both conditions			2
verboten : a sign shows residents and visitors what is not permitted in the apartments a chair displays the cleaning and personal hygiene products residents are allowed to use while living in the building will not cure @entity23 or others , it aims to make daily lives more comfortable for people whose conditions have often left them isolated and unable to hold jobs			0
@entity23 , who first felt sick from the fumes in his parents ' furniture factory when he was three or four , has lived most of his adult life in a trailer in the pristine @entity93			0
it was not until he was 35 and stumbled across an @entity96 book on @entity40 that he realised he was not alone , but it was another decade before he found a doctor who took him seriously			1
' all my life it has been like i was only half alive , ' he said			0
the new building is the first of its kind in @entity104 , according to officials in @entity3 who decided to play a pioneering role in helping people with what they called ' a very harmful problem '			1
they estimate about 5,000 people in @entity59 alone suffer from @entity40			1
anyone entering the building is expected to switch off their mobile phones			1
perfume is also banned as it can trigger reactions for @entity40 sufferers			1
file pictures the city made available the land and provided interest - free loans to help finance the £ 4.1m project			1
' we wanted to help these people to have a calm home where they hopefully will be less sick , ' said @entity3 housing office spokeswoman @entity126			1
with a mask covering his nose and mouth , @entity23 proudly shows off the 0.0 reading on a handheld electricity - measuring instrument with a triangular , green antenna			0
' this room is very good , because we have almost no electricity , ' he said , nodding around a large common area equipped with a big carbon filter to purify the air			0
the @entity3 building was constructed with special materials , by purpose - trained builders banned from smoking or using scented products like cologne as they worked anyone entering the building is expected to switch off their mobile phones , which in any case do not function inside , but there are landlines for telephone and @entity153 communication in the building			1
near the entrance , the only cleaning and personal hygiene products residents are allowed to use in the building are on prominent display			0
' avoiding the environmental burdens is really the only thing that helps most of these patients , ' said @entity162 , an internist specialised in environmental medicine who has treated @entity23 and other @entity40 patients at the @entity166 near @entity3			1
@entity40 is an unusually severe sensitivity or allergy - like reaction to many different kinds of pollutants including solvents , @entity172 's ( @entity172 ) , perfumes , petrol , diesel , smoke , ' chemicals ' in general and often encompasses problems with regard to pollen , house dust mites , and pet fur			1
multiple chemical sensitivity - unlike true allergies where the underlying mechanisms of the problem are relatively well understood and widely accepted - is generally regarded as ' idiopathic ' - meaning that it has no known mechanism of causation and its processes are not fully understood			0
source : @entity193 ' they have to find shelter somewhere where there are no antennas , no radiation from cell phones , which is getting more and more difficult , ' said @entity162			2
the condition is difficult to pin down , and sufferers are often dismissed as hypochondriacs			1
but a growing body of research suggests an initial chemical exposure can spark an ' allergic reaction ' in some people when they later confront even very low levels of a range of chemicals			2
' these patients are really suffering , ' said @entity162 , who is urging medical recognition of the condition			0
the @entity3 building was constructed with special materials , by purpose - trained builders banned from smoking or using scented products like cologne as they worked			2
it has a ventilation system aimed at sucking out all odours			0
' i think a good example for the whole thing is the plaster on the wall , ' said architect @entity227 , who designed it			0
' it does n't smell , and that is very important for these people , ' he added , saying he searched for months for a completely odourless plaster			0
the floor plan is layered like an onion ' so that the deeper you enter the apartment , the cleaner the rooms get , ' he said			2
the building 's most ' contaminated ' parts are the common areas , main hallway , stairwell and the lifts			0
from there , residents enter their apartments , moving through a hallway where they can remove ' polluted ' clothing , the bathroom and kitchen or other technically equipped rooms , before getting to the ' cleanest ' rooms : the living room and bedroom			0
a special ' net ' has also been built into the facade and roof to protect inhabitants from electromagnetic or electrostatic waves or fields , @entity227 said			0
despite all the efforts , @entity23 still only spends a few days a week in his new apartment			2
more ventilation is needed , he said , until all traces and scents of the builders are gone .			0

@entity3 apartment caters to sufferers of @entity40
mobile phones and wireless devices do not work in £ 4.1m project
those afflicted by @entity40 are often dismissed as hypochondriacs
but there is growing evidence that everyday chemicals cause reactions
