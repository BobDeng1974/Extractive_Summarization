in an astonishing attack on one of @entity13 ’s flagship policies to boost the economy , the business secretary claimed the ‘ route of using big institutions did n’t work ’ and said there was still a ‘ lot of frustration with the big banks ’			1
singling out state - backed @entity21 , he said that five years after the financial crisis small companies are still being starved of cash by lenders which were bailed out by @entity5 taxpayers			2
‘ the restriction on credit that followed the financial crisis is a problem that has persisted to this day , ’ he said			0
‘ five years after the crisis , we still have more money being taken out [ of small business lending ] , by @entity21 in particular , than being put in by @entity33 , @entity34 and some of the new challenger banks			1
’ mr @entity0 ’s comments came at an event to promote the government - backed @entity38 , which provides state support for ‘ challenger banks ’ and other alternatives to the main @entity44 lenders			2

it was designed to boost the economy by halting a downward spiral of lending and borrowing since the onset of the financial crisis he continued : ‘ ever since i got into government i ’ve been having conversations with @entity13 about how we get small business lending going			2
