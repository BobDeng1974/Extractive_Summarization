mr @entity7 met his wife while he was working in @entity3 as a consultant in 2009			1
their daughter @entity9 was born in @entity3 in 2010 and they married in 2012			2

' you have to earn £ 18,600 a year as a minimum			2
i 'm self - employed and earn about £ 3,000 a month and i gave them bank statements and everything i could think of to prove it			0

they said i didnt give the necessary evidence , but did n't say what that was supposed to be			0
' she had 28 days to appeal but you have to be in your home country to do that , so she would have had to go back to @entity3 so we could appeal it			0
' if we cant get this decision turned around , we will all have to go back to @entity3 and start the process of applying again			2
' when we went to @entity3 to hand in the forms and evidence , i was there to answer any questions they wanted to ask , but they did n't ask me anything			2
' it 's not the refusal that i think is unfair , but it does indicate incompetence and a broken system			0

a @entity26 spokesman said : ' we welcome those who wish to make a life in the @entity5 with their family , work hard and make a contribution			1
