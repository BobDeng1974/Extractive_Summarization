@entity0 will rely on homegrown talent as they begin their 2014 - 15 @entity3 campaign with a tie against @entity5 at @entity6 on tuesday night			1
@entity0 are due to field a side in which all but three of the squad have been with the club since the age of seven			1
the exceptions are defender @entity13 , who came from @entity14 , @entity15 , formerly of @entity16 , and goalkeeper @entity17 from @entity18			2
@entity19 will be part of a @entity0 squad packed with homegrown talent @entity23 will be hoping to feature during @entity0 's 2014 - 15 @entity3 campaign the line - up will be similar to the one that drew 0 - 0 with neighbours @entity28 in the @entity29 at @entity30 earlier this month			1
coach @entity31 said : ‘ we ’ve got younger players coming up and it ’s only going to improve them			1
we played three or four schoolboys at @entity28 early in the season and it was a shock to the system because they were n’t quite ready for it			0
‘ now they ’ve had a few games , they are more experienced and we hoped it would be a different story in the home match with @entity28			0
certainly , they ’ve improved a lot and i think this team will continue to improve			2
’ @entity31 spoke to @entity46 about why he has such affinity with the @entity3			1
the @entity49 coach was in charge of the 2011 side that lifted the trophy and his father , former @entity0 player and manager @entity53 , won the competition in 1954 , 1955 and 1956 and captained the side in the third of those seasons			1
in total , he played 27 ties and is one of only five players to have earned three winners ’ medals			2
‘ the competition means a lot to me , ’ said @entity31			1
i grew up with my dad telling me how he won @entity69 with the @entity70			0
he played more @entity3 games than anybody else - there were only a few of them who played in all the fixtures - and he ’s got that record so i grew up with all of that			0
@entity17 is one of just three players not to have come through @entity0 's academy ‘ i wanted to play in the @entity3 myself but i only had a brief substitute appearance when i was playing here [ against @entity83 in 1984 ]			1
i was still at school at the time			0
‘ in my time as a coach , it ’s been great as well			2
i can honestly say , while the goal is to win the @entity3 of course , it is not the biggest thing			0
it ’s the experience the players gain from having a run in the competition			1
‘ the year we got to the final when @entity97 was in the team as a schoolboy , the experience he gained there stood him in good stead playing for @entity0 and @entity103 at the top level			2
i know that run helped him go such a long way			0
@entity107 in action during @entity0 's under 18 fixture against @entity28 earlier this month ‘ it ’s more what the @entity3 can do itself in preparing players for bigger challenges with competitive football and a simulation of first - team football			1
if you get to the end of it , you deal with big crowds and extra pressure			0
the most important thing about it is to win it and it ’s a massive bonus as it really helps you but it ’s the process along the way			0
‘ you can see them develop in front of your own eyes if they get through each round			0
the problem can easily be when you go out as it ’s a cup competition and you can lose in the first round			1
then you miss that opportunity			0
‘ we ’re making some progress by playing matches at @entity30 this season and we need to simulate that kind of game whether we ’re in the @entity3 or not			0
but , in @entity143 football , the @entity3 is still one of the most special tournaments to play in			0
@entity31 is mobbed by his players after winning the @entity3 cup final in 2011 ‘ a number of them are ready to make quite a bit of a breakthrough and it would definitely help to have a little run in the @entity3			1
’ @entity154 - @entity153 missed the draw with @entity28 due to injury , with @entity13 dropping into defence , while @entity158 remains sidelined			0
the cup tie is also live on @entity160 as @entity0 strive to win the competition for the first time since 2011			1
@entity0 ( probable ) : @entity17 ; @entity15 , @entity163 , @entity13 , @entity164 ; @entity19 , @entity165 ; @entity23 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 .			2

@entity0 set to field side in which all but three squad *members* have been with the club since age of seven
united *youngsters* take on @entity5 at @entity6 on tuesday night
coach @entity31 *claims* cup competition means a lot to his players
