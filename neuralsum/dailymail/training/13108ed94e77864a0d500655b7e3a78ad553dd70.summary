@entity49 child : another frame shows her sporting a more hippie look , with pale lips , smoky eyes and a woven band around her head in each picture , of course , one can see items from the collection , all made from a fake gold called @entity59			2
but the phallic ' grow a @entity61 ' pieces - an instant sellout after the august 1st launch - are curiously absent from the shoot , indicating that even she could n't get her hands on any of it			1
those pendants , earrings and rings are priced between $ 12 and $ 20 - but other items hold steeper price tags			2
@entity72 : phallic jewelry designs , from ke $ ha 's grow a @entity61 collection , have proved an unlikely sellout			1
the line includes earrings , $ 15 ( left ) a pendant necklace , $ 24 ( center ) and a ring , $ 12 ( right ) for the slightly less provocative : rose rings ( $ 60 ) , a teeth charm bracelet ( $ 135 ) and a spike cuff ( $ 195 ) the most expensive piece on offer is a skull necklace at $ 600			2
quite pricey : ke $ ha 's most expensive offering is a $ 600 skull necklace made from cooled lava the line includes two other collections : warrior , which features arrowhead and shark teeth designs and @entity97 , which is modeled from human teeth - real human teeth , sent in by fans			2
ke $ ha is of course best known for her ' garbage - chic ' style			0
she told @entity107 last year : ' i do n't take myself that seriously			0
' indeed : she famously wore a garbage bag to the 2010 @entity110			0
those who want to be as much like ke $ ha as possible will likely make @entity97 a success too , because she herself has worn teeth in the past			0
in 2011 , she asked her fans via @entity118 to send her their teeth			0
' i got , like , over 1,000 human teeth , ' she told the @entity122 last year			0
' i made it into a bra top , and a headdress , and earrings , and necklaces			0
i 've worn it out ! ' now fans can do the same .			0

the ' grow a @entity61 ' pieces were an instant sellout after the august 1st launch
