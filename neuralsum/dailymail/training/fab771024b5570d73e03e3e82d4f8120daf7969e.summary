by @entity0 published : 11:36 est , 9 may 2013 updated : 20:51 est , 9 may 2013 this is the moment a leopard got too close to a herd of elephants - and got a soaking for its troubles			1
the big cat tried its luck against the herd of 15 elephants by stalking the group and sipping from the same water hole			1
but one of the herd spotted the leopard , decided it was being far too bold and squirted a stream of water in its direction to shoo it away			0
the leopard had been stalking the herd of 15 elephants when one decided to give it a good hosing to scare it off the leopard was spotted by @entity21 photographer @entity20 , in @entity22 in @entity23 the moment was captured by @entity20 , 46 , at the @entity26 water hole in @entity22 , @entity23 , as he watched the elephants at play			1
the @entity21 photographer said : ' they were splashing about , spraying water on their backs and being rather noisy			1
' but other animals in the surroundings , including giraffes and zebras , clearly sensed danger and moved away			0
' suddenly i discovered a leopard entering the open area around the waterhole , ' said mr @entity20			1
the elephant loomed over the leopard as it stalked the herd the leopard tried its luck against the herd the @entity26 waterhole but came away with a soaking mr @entity20 said it was a ' one of a kind ' experience to capture the two - second tussle ' the leopard calmly and without any signs of fear just walked between the elephants and some giraffes to the waterhole , crouched down and started to lap up water			1
' the elephants must first have been as surprised as me at the cat 's careless attitude , despite the proximity of the much larger elephants			2
' the elephants began to encircle the leopard in an act of intimidation			2
it began to walk away , but paused between some of the herd and a giraffe			0
and that 's when one elephant decided to teach the smaller creature a lesson			0
' what i did not notice at the time was that one of the elephants must have sucked up a trunk full of water , ' mr @entity20 said			1
' with a flash that elephant sprayed the water at the leopard , which stood no more than five metres away			0
' the impromptu shower sent the leopard running for the bushes and left mr @entity20 , who uses a @entity91 camera , reeling with his good fortune			2
he said : ' i do not think i breathed from the moment the leopard started walking between the elephants to the waterhole			2
' the shower was so unexpected and i was very lucky to have captured it - that sequence took maybe two seconds			0
' i knew immediately that i had witnessed something very special			0
' it is already elusive enough to observe leopards in the wild , but this was one - of - a - kind			0
