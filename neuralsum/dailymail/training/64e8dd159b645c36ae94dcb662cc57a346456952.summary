by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 13:07 est , 16 november 2012 updated : 13:12 est , 16 november 2012 smiling with his arms around his three young children as his wife looks on , @entity2 is the picture of a supportive husband and father			1
and on saturday , mr @entity2 made the ultimate sacrifice in a bid to save his children 's lives , perishing in an early - morning fire after he ran back inside to save them			1
but along with their father , nine - year - old @entity17 , eight - year - old @entity15 and four - year - old @entity16 all died in the blaze that took firefighters two hours to extinguish			1
only their mother , @entity21 , survived the deadly flames after escaping from a second - storey window onto the roof of their home in @entity28 , @entity29			1
ripped apart : @entity21 was the only survivor of the fatal @entity28 fire that killed her husband @entity33 and their children ( from left ) @entity15 , @entity36 and @entity16 cardboard boxes left inches from a wood - burning stove are being blamed as the cause of the blaze			1
the fact that the family was only using the stove temporarily as they waited for loan approval to finance their purchase of a new furnace only adds to the tragedy of the situation			1
a funeral will be held on sunday , and the community is holding a bowling fundraiser on december 9 at the @entity55 and @entity56 , where the family went hours before the tragedy			1
' @entity21 was very moved by the support when i talked to her last night , ' family friend @entity59 wrote on the @entity63 page for the event			1
' she is very grateful for the love and support she is getting and so amazed at how much love and support the bowling family is showing			2
' the @entity69 reports that when the fire department arrived on the scene , they tried to enter through a window but ruled the blaze too dangerous and were forced to pull back			2
tragic : @entity21 , 31 , survived by climbing out a window but she realized that her husband and three children , including @entity15 , four , ' went the wrong way ' @entity79 fire chief @entity78 said that the four victims were likely already dead when the responders got to the scene around 2.30am			1
@entity83 and @entity84 called the police when they heard @entity21 screaming and they called the fire department			1
' we jumped out of bed and saw the orange fire on the front of the house , ' neighbor @entity87 told the @entity69			0
' i called 911 while my husband jumped into some clothes			0
' while i was on the phone with emergency , i opened the window and hollered out to her that i heard her and she kept hollering to please help			0
' ( @entity21 ) said that her husband and kids were in the house which i relayed to 911			1
when i opened the window i heard her and her husband talking ... and she just kept saying " they went the wrong way , they went the wrong way ! " ' horror : a fire at this rural wood home early on saturday killed a father and his three children , while the childrens ' mother escaped and was taken to a hospital to be treated for smoke inhalation the bodies of the three children were found in a bedroom on the second floor while the father ’s body was found at the top of the stairs nearby			1
@entity21 was on the roof when emergency workers arrived			1
this fire - which is the deadliest fire in @entity29 in the past 20 years - is not the family ’s first tragedy , as the @entity131 reports that one of the couple ’s son @entity133 died of @entity135 in 2007			1
@entity21 is still being treated for smoke inhalation at @entity137 in @entity138 and is fielding visits from friends as she plans the funerals for her husband and children			1
' @entity17 was her soul , the kids were her soul , so i just do n’t know how well she ’s going to recover , ' her friend @entity144 told the paper			0
' it ’s just been one thing after another for her			0
' deadly : firefighting crews from @entity138 and four other towns were called in after the fire was reported at around 2:30 a.m. , and it took an hour to extinguish the blaze remainders : the husband was found at the top of the stairs on the second floor and the three children were found together in a second floor bedroom the children attended @entity166 where principal @entity167 described them as ' great kids , very nice kids			1
' ' this is just such a tragedy			2
it 's going to be devastating for the kids because it 's such a small school and everybody knows everybody , ' @entity167 told the @entity69			0
the @entity175 had just moved into the house in the rural town of @entity28 six months ago			2
they were in the process of buying the house through a short sale , meaning that it would take months for the loan agreement would be finalized by the lender , @entity184 , in the coming months			2
once the sale was approved , they were planning on replacing the 46 - year - old hot water furnace , which explains their use of the wood stove with a propane heater			2
the @entity175 arrived home late friday night after an evening of family bowling and lit the stove in the first floor living room			2
investigators found empty cardboard boxes - which were likely used as kindling to start the fire in the first place - just inches away from the stove			2
a container of lighter fluid was nearby as well , which added to the pace at which the fire spread			0
damage : the fire ravaged the house and caused part of the roof to collapse tragic end of a nice night : the family lit the fire to keep the house warm after returning home from a night at the local bowling lanes police are still investigating the fire , but their initial reports suggest that they did not have smoke alarms installed in the home			2
one of the last people to see the husband and children alive was the owner of their local bowling center , @entity55 , who was in shock at the news of the fire			0
‘ the entire bowling center is in shock			0
it feels like he ’s been here forever , ’ owner @entity229 said of @entity2			0
her work : @entity21 works from home and self published this novel over the summer ‘ we were surprised he was only 30 because it seems like he ’s been here so long			1

@entity2 worked at @entity56 in @entity138 and @entity21 is a self - published author who released her first book ‘ @entity246 ’ earlier this summer			1
in her brief author bio , she describes herself as living happily in a small town in @entity29 with her husband of 10 years			0
she also says that she is the mother of four , including her son @entity133 who died in 2007			1
' i enjoy drawing , and have enough books in my house to start my own bookstore			0
i enjoy horseback riding , singing , and as strange as this sounds , yard work			0
i 've travelled all over as an ex-military brat , ' she wrote			0
friends and family remembered how the children had vivid imaginations , playing ' spies ' with each other at the house , where the family had moved just six months ago			1
@entity16 loved hot dogs and @entity272 shows , while his big sister hoped to be a horse trainer or jockey when she grew up , and loved helping her mother in the kitchen			0
their big brother @entity2 shared many of his father 's hobbies - building and bowling - and looked forward to learning golf with his dad and grandfather			0
@entity166 remained open during the @entity288 holiday monday in order for the victim ’s classmates to meet with grief counsellors that were available			0
one of those students was @entity294 , whose mother @entity295 brought the third grader to meet with a counsellor because she was friends with @entity15			0
