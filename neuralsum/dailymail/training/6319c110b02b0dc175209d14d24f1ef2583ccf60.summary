by @entity0 linguists claim that humans learned to speak by copying primates and birds 100,000 years ago			1
a silvery gibbon is pictured there are plenty of animals that talk by mimicking the language of humans			2
but now linguists claim that humans learned to speak by copying primates and birds 100,000 years ago			1
while previous research has suggested that humans copied the melodic part of our language from birds , @entity13 experts now think that we evolved the content - carrying part of our speech from primates			1
the two types of communication fused together into roughly the form of human language that we know today , the experts said			1
@entity28 , a linguist from @entity29 , ( @entity29 ) said : ‘ how did human language arise ? it 's far enough in the past that we ca n't just go back and figure it out directly			1
the best we can do is come up with a theory that is broadly compatible with what we know about human language and other similar systems in nature			1
’ scientists believe that human language is unique as it can expand to describe an infinite amount of new meanings			1
but our language still shares qualities with other animals			0
‘ yes , human language is unique , but if you take it apart in the right way , the two parts we identify are in fact of a finite state , ’ dr @entity28 said			1
‘ those two components have antecedents in the animal world			0
according to our hypothesis , they came together uniquely in human language			2
’ the team ’s reasoning goes that as birds only sing a certain number of melodies , humans much have incorporated another aspect from nature – probably from primates			2
dr @entity28 explained that the human language consists of two distinct layers : the expressive layer , which relates to the structure of sentences , and the ‘ lexical layer ’ where the meaning is found			2
while previous research has suggested that humans got the melodic part of our language from birds , @entity13 experts now think that we evolved the content - carrying part of our speech from primates			1
a screen print showing a family of prehistoric cave dwellers is pictured a 2013 study claims that @entity80 could speak like modern humans			0
in the last 20 years , some scientists have come to believe that @entity80 had the ability to communicate with each other using speech , and new analysis of a fossilised hyoid bone has added weight to their claims			2
the horseshoe - shaped bone in the neck looks like a modern human ’s and now computer modelling has revealed that it was probably used in a similar way			2
the hyoid bone supports the root of the tongue and enables humans to speak			0
researchers believe the way the bone worked is ‘ highly suggestive ’ of complex speech in @entity80			0
before the discovery of a @entity80 hyoid bone in 1989 , it was thought that only modern humans were capable of complex speech , which evolved around 100,000 years ago			1
he thinks that both layers are derived from the languages of birds and mammals			0
the researchers , who were joined by colleagues from the @entity114 , admit that there is more work to be done on their hypothesis			0
the most recent ancestor between birds and humans appears to have existed about 300 million years ago , so there would almost have to be an indirect connection via older primates - even possibly the silvery gibbon , which is unusual because it sings			1
the endangered animals can make long , complicated songs using 14 types of note to signal territory , woo mates and communicate with family members			0
@entity132 , co-author of the study , published in the journal @entity135 , noted that researchers are still exploring how these two modes could have merged in humans , but the general concept of new functions developing from existing building blocks is a familiar one in evolution			0
‘ you have these two pieces			0
you put them together and something novel emerges , ’ he said			0
‘ we ca n't go back with a time machine and see what happened , but we think that 's the basic story we 're seeing with language			0

linguists from the @entity29 claim that early humans evolved the content - carrying part of our speech from primates
*people* living 100,000 years ago got the melodic part of our language by copying birdsong , previous research suggests
together , these two *inspirations* combine to create the form of human language that we know today , they claim
