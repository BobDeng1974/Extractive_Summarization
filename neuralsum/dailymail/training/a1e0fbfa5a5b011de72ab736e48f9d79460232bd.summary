by @entity0 in 2014 many people will be seeking a date for @entity3 via dating websites and smart phone apps			2
gone are the days when women had to wait to be asked to dance at a stately hall ball or seek their father 's approval on whether a man was rich enough to take their hand in marriage			1
back when @entity16 was penning her novels in 19th century @entity18 , a woman 's reputation was everything and finding a husband was imperative			1
but while many of the traditions from that time have changed , there 's still a lot that modern day daters can learn from their literary heroines ... timeless : modern women can still learn from @entity16 's stories which are no longer just books but films and tv series too we all know that first impressions count on a first date but do n't be too quick to judge			1
in @entity37 mr @entity36 dismisses @entity38 as ' barely tolerable ' and ' not handsome enough to tempt me ' after their first meeting but soon realises the error of his ways once he gets to know her			2
our friends may have our best interests at heart but they do n't always make the ideal matchmakers			2
a man they deem to be your perfect match could actually be the opposite			0
this is proved in the novel , @entity56 , when the book 's heroine @entity57 convinces her friend @entity56 that farmer @entity60 is n't the man for her and she should reject his proposal			1
she instead encourages her to pursue the gentleman mr @entity64 but this ends in tears when he reveals he does n't have feelings for her			0
if only @entity69 had followed her heart			0
as @entity16 writes : ' you must be the best judge of your own happiness			1
' but keep your friends close as you will certainly need them as you negotiate the dating scene as @entity16 observes in @entity76 : ' friendship is certainly the finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love			1
' was n't love at first sight : but the path of true love ran smoothly for mr @entity36 and @entity84 in the end in @entity37 too good to be true : online daters have to be wary of boastful profiles when online dating , it 's not easy to know if you can believe someone is who they really say they are when they boast of their riches and good - looks on their profile			1
unfortunately , it was the same in @entity16 's day and men who seemed too good to be true usually were			1
she illustrates this in the character of mr @entity37 in @entity37 , a charming soldier who makes a wonderful impression on everyone he meets and seems like the perfect catch			0
however , he turns out to be untrustworthy after it is revealed he gambled away his inheritance and nearly ruins the reputation of @entity110 by convincing her to elope with him			0
he had no intention of making her an ' honest woman ' by marrying her but is forced to do so by mr @entity36			0
@entity117 words : author @entity16 hands up if you 've been guilty of rejecting someone just because they were n't an inch taller , did n't earn enough money or shared your love of your favourite film			1
while it 's fine to have standards , being too fussy could prevent you from finding true love			1
mr @entity36 shows he was being a bit too picky when he declares in @entity37 that he is looking for an ' accomplished woman ' who ' must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern languages , to deserve the word ; and besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved			0
' @entity148 also fears she will never meet a man to meet her high standards in @entity151 when she declares : ' @entity154 , the more i know of the world , the more i am convinced that i shall never see a man whom i can really love			1
i require so much ! ' she adds : ' i could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every point coincide with my own			0
he must enter in all my feelings ; the same books , the same music must charm us both			0
' looking for such a mr @entity165 could leave you single for a long time			0
in @entity151 , the wise @entity168 cautions her younger sister @entity169 not to get carried away with her feelings for mr @entity171 after he comes to her rescue			0
@entity168 advises her to be more prudent : ' pray , pray be composed , and do not betray what you feel to every body present			0
' but @entity169 does n't listen and gets caught up in a whirlwind romance before having her heart broken			0
fools rush in : @entity169 in @entity151 , played by @entity178 in the film , listened to her heart over her head in @entity183 , after being rejected by mr @entity182 , @entity181 marries for money			0
later she is reunited with her first love and they have an affair which leads to her fall from grace			1
playing cupid : but that meant @entity56 , played by @entity191 , almost missed out on love her herself @entity56 is so busy involving herself in other people 's business she completely misses the fact that her one and only is her life - long friend mr @entity196 - until another woman expresses an interest in him			1
@entity16 writes of her @entity201 moment : ' a few minutes were sufficient for making her acquainted with her own heart			1
a mind like hers , once opening to suspicion , made rapid progress ; she touched , she admitted , she acknowledged the whole truth ... mr @entity196 must marry no one but herself ! ' could your true love be staring you in the face ? in @entity212 's relatives are concerned when mr @entity171 insists their relationship must be kept secret - and it turns out he is engaged to someone else			1
meanwhile , @entity168 's intended beau @entity217 has been secretly engaged to @entity218 for four years and regrets his proposal			2
so if a new man refuses to introduce you to his friends and family , wo n't acknowledge being in a relationship with you on @entity224 or otherwise and insists your dates remain secret , consider why			2
if he loves you ( and if he 's really single ) , he should n't hide you			2
happily ever after : but women today do n't need a man for financial security in @entity37 , poor @entity229 becomes engaged to mr @entity230			0
' there is no earthly reason why i should n't be as happy with him as any other ' , she tells @entity235 , to which she responds : ' but he 's ridiculous ! ' @entity237 tells her friend she ' ca n't afford to be romantic ' because at ' i 'm twenty - seven years old , i 've no money and no prospects			2
i 'm already a burden to my parents and i 'm frightened			0
so do n't you judge me , @entity244			0
' thankfully women today do n't have to be dependent on their parents and then a husband for money and a roof over their heads ( and 27 is no longer considered an age which it 's old to be unmarried )			2
@entity252 , a film about a woman obsessed with @entity37 who travels to a @entity16 theme park in search for her perfect gentleman is out now on dvd			1

times and *technology* have changed since @entity16 's day
but some things still remain true when it comes to finding true love
