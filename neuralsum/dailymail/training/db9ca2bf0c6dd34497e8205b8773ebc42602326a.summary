by @entity0 @entity1 : 10:13 est , 19 december 2013 @entity2 : 19:56 est , 19 december 2013 @entity4 ’s racy routines on @entity5 and her flirty interview techniques have raised more than a few eyebrows over the past few months			0
but a @entity9 politician found herself at the centre of a backlash yesterday after suggesting she ’d like to give the @entity5 finalist a ‘ slap ’			0
@entity14 , 49 , who was one of the ‘ @entity15 ’ standing for @entity16 in 2010 , provoked the row after watching the newsreader dance on saturday ’s show			1
yesterday mrs @entity14 apologised for her choice of words – but said it was absurd that anyone could think a ‘ flippant ’ comment about a reality tv show meant she supported violence			1
mrs @entity14 failed to win a place in @entity16 when she stood in @entity42 in the @entity43			1
next year she will fight for a seat in the @entity16 representing @entity45			0
the would - be @entity47 ’s initial quip – in which she misspelt the @entity22 presenter and @entity5 favourite ’s surname as ‘ @entity51 ’ – was originally viewed by just her 733 followers			1
however it was swiftly passed on by @entity54 , a @entity55 councillor in @entity42 , who wrote that it was ‘ disappointing from someone who wants to represent me in @entity59 ’			1
yesterday the councillor added : ‘ this was n’t a personal conversation , but an actual message from mrs @entity14 to 733 people and organisations who were following her			1
‘ in an age when violence against women is denounced by politicians from all parties and closely associated with domestic violence , i found this offensive and inappropriate			0
’ another local @entity55 activist , @entity72 , posted : ‘ so you ’re advocating violence against another women			2
’ favourite : @entity75 and partner @entity76 are tipped to win the @entity5 final on saturday night and @entity78 , a @entity55 councillor and university tutor , posted : ‘ this is a shameful comment for someone seeking public office , you should know better			1
’ yesterday mrs @entity14 said she was ‘ astounded ’ by the response to her comment , telling how the vicious reaction had left her feeling threatened			1
she added : ‘ i sincerely apologise to anyone who was offended by my comment – it was supposed to be a flippant comment about reality tv			0
surely no rational - minded person would think i was meaning to condone violence against women in any shape or form ? ’ mrs @entity14 , who was involved in the @entity9 ’ @entity97 campaign to increase the number of female @entity99 at the last election , insisted that she had n’t intended any disrespect towards miss @entity4			2
she said : ‘ we all find certain people on reality television irritating , but she seems a very nice lady who like me is trying to hold down a job while looking after a family as well – it was nothing personal			0
‘ what i ’ve found particularly upsetting is the way i ’ve been lambasted on @entity27 by an aggressive posse of @entity55 activists			0
‘ some of my children are on @entity27 and it ’s very unpleasant for them to see their mother bullied and told she ’s not fit for public office in this way			0
unfortunately it ’s this sort of abuse that puts women off trying to take part in politics in the first place			0
’ neither miss @entity4 nor the @entity22 chose to comment on the tweet last night			1
however one of mrs @entity14 ’s close relatives said the candidate had helped her escape from an abusive relationship – and insisted that she would be the last person to belittle the impact of domestic violence			2
the woman , who ca n’t be named for legal reasons , said : ‘ @entity14 nursed me when i had been physically hurt , she helped rehouse me and get me away from a relationship in which i went to hell and back			2
‘ i could n’t have got through it without her help , so i can say for certain that she would never downplay domestic violence – this was just a tongue - in - cheek remark			0
