experts have discovered that this dove grey suit was once worn by notorious @entity3 leader @entity2			1
they used sweat stains on the uniform to link it to the overweight @entity8 commander and it is now expected to fetch £ 85,000 when it goes under the hammer in @entity12 , @entity13			1
@entity2 , who founded the @entity14 and was commander of the @entity8 air force , was well known for being overweight and as a result the suit shows the strain of being worn by the large officer			1
it was originally believed to be a replica , but the careful examination of the sweat blemishes and fraying on the buttons and buckles led experts to believe it had been worn			1
the dove grey suit made by a @entity30 tailor that was once worn by ruthless @entity3 commander @entity2 @entity2 , pictured in his full military dress during @entity32 , favoured a dove grey suit @entity34 , owner of @entity35 , where the uniform is being sold , said the wear and tear on the uniform helped them identify @entity2 as its original owner			1
he said : ' @entity2 was hugely overweight and had a tendency to sweat a lot , that would explain the profusion of sweat in the tunic			1
' the stress levels on the tunic 's folds coupled with the strain on the broaches of the tunic show it was worn by someone overweight			0
' this also proves it was worn for a long , long time by someone who was fat enough to cause it to stretch and wear over a period of time			0
' he also had a habit when he used to walk around talking to people of putting his left hand into his left pocket			0
because of this the wear on the left pocket is substantially more than the right			0
' the outfit was made by the @entity30 tailor , @entity71 , who was known to have made uniforms for the @entity73 during the war			1
stress levels on the tunic 's folds coupled with the strain on the broaches of the tunic show it was worn by someone overweight the uniform was believed to have been liberated by the @entity82 before it found its way into a collection in @entity86 the outfit was made by the @entity30 tailor , @entity71 , who was known to have made uniforms for the @entity73 during the war although the tailoring of dove grey blue ensemble is very good , the materials used are of remarkably lower quality when compared to the uniforms worn by @entity3 officers at the beginning of the war			1
mr @entity34 , from @entity12 , @entity13 , said : ' as the war progressed , it got harder to get materials and quality everywhere went down			0
' there was also an effort by @entity2 to appear less grand during the latter part of the war			2
this is because as he was going around meeting the population , if he looks like he is living in opulence when they are in poverty it would not go down well			0
' @entity2 , pictured above , saw himself as @entity113 's successor and was known to have been ill for much of the war @entity115 chief @entity2 pictured with @entity113 by the @entity3 leader 's train during the war mr @entity34 bought the uniform at auction from a private museum in @entity86 , and at the time it was believed to have been a copy of @entity2 's uniform that would have been used only as a display model and not actually worn by @entity2			1
it was not until mr @entity34 began looking at the tunic and trousers in detail that he realised there were too many aspects of the uniform that could only have been caused by being worn by the @entity3 himself			2

he fought in the air force during @entity135 and at the end of the conflict was recognised as a hero			1

in 1935 he became commander in chief of the luftwaffe and held the post until the final days of the war			0

@entity2 was indicted by the @entity157 in @entity158 in 1946			2
@entity2 was found guilty of war crimes and sentenced to death by hanging			2

' we do n't know the origin of the uniform			0
we assume it was liberated by the @entity82 and the local population and found its way into a collection in @entity86			0
' the uniform is being sold as a set which includes the original tunic , trousers and braces worn by @entity2 as well as a replica peaked cap and an original @entity3 general 's belt that would not have been owned by the @entity3 commander			1
