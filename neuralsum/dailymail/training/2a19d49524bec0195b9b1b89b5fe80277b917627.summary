and while unemployment generally makes all people unhappy , it is twice as likely seriously to affect the mental wellbeing of @entity4 as those of other denominations			1
the findings suggest that the economic downturn may have had a far more serious effect on people in @entity15 than other countries , with joblessness more likely to have led to depression among @entity20 workers			1
hard at work : people in @entity4 countries work harder because they feel guiltier about taking time off , a study has found ( file picture ) scientists from @entity25 studied more than 150,000 people in 82 countries to find out whether there was any truth behind the notion of a @entity4 work ethic			1
the countries deemed historically @entity4 by the researchers , from @entity34 , included the @entity15 , the @entity36 @entity35 , @entity37 , @entity25 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45			1
they found those who were unemployed in all countries said they were less happy when out of work , regardless of religious denomination , but this was exacerbated among those in @entity4 countries			1
in fact , @entity4 are generally 40 per cent less happy when unemployed than others , they reported			1
researchers took into account a number of factors which could have skewed results - such as marital status , age , gender , income , education and health			0
@entity69 economist dr @entity68 , who led the study , said : ‘ the negative effect of unemployment on self - reported happiness was twice as strong for @entity4 compared with @entity74			2
‘ we found that the work ethic does exist and that individual @entity4 and historically @entity4 societies appear to value work much more than others			2
‘ at the individual level , unemployment hurts protestants much more than it does non-protestants			0
@entity4 causes a stronger work ethic			2
misery : while unemployment generally makes all people unhappy , it is twice as likely seriously to affect the mental wellbeing of @entity4 as those of other denominations ( file picture ) ‘ interestingly , it is not so much @entity4 individuals who are hurt more by being unemployed as it is individuals - both @entity4 and @entity74 - living in @entity4 societies			1
’ he added that the results supported sociologist @entity100 ’s idea that a strong work ethic is something which has evolved from historical @entity4 , rather than contemporary interpretations of @entity104 first came up with the notion of a @entity4 work ethic in 1904 , suggesting that the religious concept of achieving @entity109 - given grace through frugality and working hard was one of the crucibles of capitalism			2
despite the theory being widely accepted since , the @entity69 researchers sought to test it			0
@entity117 , professor of @entity118 at @entity119 , said the study ‘ shows that the @entity4 work ethic is alive and kicking ’			0
he added : ‘ it was very evident during the @entity123 and @entity124 years and the current coalition emphasis on the negative aspects of benefits are also evidence of it			0
‘ it is very much a cultural thing			0
in the @entity15 , for example , people work for achievement ; in the @entity36 , with fewer safety nets - no redundancy [ pay ] for example - fear is likely a driver			1
‘ i think 2008 made some differences			0
people who had followed the work ethic for years found themselves without a job			0
all the sacrifices - working long hours , not seeing the kids - had not worked out			0
' we may find that ’s damaged the work ethic and people are putting less focus on work and more on a balance between work and the rest of their life			0
