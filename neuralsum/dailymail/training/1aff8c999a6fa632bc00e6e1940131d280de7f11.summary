by @entity0 published : 10:20 est , 23 may 2013 updated : 10:28 est , 23 may 2013 a glow - in - the - dark cockroach , a harp - shaped carnivorous sponge and the smallest frog on @entity7 are among the most bizarre newly discovered species of 2012 , chosen by scientists			1
also slithering into this year 's top ten is a snail - eating false coral snake , as well as flowering bushes from a disappearing forest in @entity15			1
a green lacewing that was discovered through social media and hanging flies that perfectly mimicked ginkgo tree leaves 165 million years ago were also included by the @entity20 at @entity21			1
the @entity20 at @entity21 has compiled a list of the ten best newly discovered species of 2012			1
they include a glow - in - the - dark cockroach , a green lacewing that was first discovered through @entity26 , and a frog that is only 7mm big			1
a total of 140 species were nominated tiny @entity30 found : @entity31 carnivorous sponge - @entity33 lyra found : @entity35 , @entity36 @entity38 - @entity37 lomamiensis found : @entity39 snail - eating snake - @entity40 noalamina found : @entity42 @entity43 anomala found : @entity44 7mm frog - @entity45 amanuensis found : @entity47 endangered forest plant - @entity48 petrikensis found : @entity15 glow - in - the - dark cockroach - @entity51 luckae country : @entity54 @entity57 - @entity56 jade country : @entity59 hanging fly fossil - @entity60 ginkgofolia country : @entity62 rounding up the list is a new monkey with a blue backside and human - like eyes , a tiny violet and a black staining fungus that threatens rare @entity70 cave paintings in @entity44			1
the weird and wonderful creatures were all identified for the first time in 2012			0
they make it into a list published each year by a global committee of taxonomists , scientists responsible for species exploration and classification			1
professor @entity81 , founding director of the group , said : ' we have identified only about two million of an estimated 10 to 12 million living species and that does not count most of the microbial world			1
' for decades , we have averaged 18,000 species discoveries per year which seemed reasonable before the biodiversity crisis			1
now , knowing that millions of species may not survive the 21st century , it is time to pick up the pace			2
members made their selection from more than 140 nominated species			1
to be considered , species must have been described in compliance with the appropriate code of nomenclature , whether botanical , zoological or microbiological , and have been officially named during 2012			2
nominations for the 2014 list - for species described in 2013 - can now be made online			1
previous top ten lists from the past six years are available from the @entity21 website			1
this glow - in - the dark cockroach was discovered last year in @entity54			2
its official name is @entity110 and it uses luminescence to create its glow			0
more than a dozen luminescent cockroaches have been discovered since 1999 and this latest addition is thought to now be endangered , or even extinct			2
only one specimen has been found a new species of snail - eating snake was discovered in @entity119 mountain range in @entity42			1
the snake is nocturnal and hunts soft - bodied prey including earthworms and amphibian eggs , as well as snails and slugs			2
the snake is not a threat to humans and can ward off prey by mimicking the dark and light rings found on venomous coral snakes			1
its name comes from the @entity133 phrase ' no a la mina ' or ' no to the mine			0
' biologist dr @entity135 , of the @entity136 , @entity137 , said : ' selecting the final list of new species from a wide representation of life forms such as bacteria , fungi , plants and animals , is difficult			1
' it requires finding an equilibrium between certain criteria and the special insights revealed by selection committee members			0
' we look for organisms with unexpected features or size and those found in rare or difficult to reach habitats			0
we also look for organisms that are especially significant to humans - those that play a certain role in human habitat or that are considered a close relative			0
' this carnivorous sponge , called @entity163 was found in the @entity35 off the coast of @entity36			0
it lives in water that averages 3,339 metres deep and has large , harp - or lyre - shaped vanes , with more than 20 parallel vertical branches , often found with a balloon - like ball on the top			0
this unusual shape maximizes the surface area of the sponge for contact and capture of planktonic prey this year 's top ten came from @entity31 , the @entity35 off the north east @entity180 coast , @entity36 , the @entity39 , @entity42 , @entity44 , @entity47 , @entity15 , @entity54 , @entity59 and @entity62			0
@entity81 said : ' i do n't know whether to be more astounded by the species discovered each year , or the depths of our ignorance about biodiversity of which we are a part			1
' at the same time we search the heavens for other earthlike planets , we should make it a high priority to explore the biodiversity on the most earthlike planet of them all : @entity7			0
discovered in the @entity196 of the @entity39 , the lesula is an @entity198 monkey			2
it is is only the second species of monkey discovered in @entity202 in the past 28 years			1
scientists first saw the monkey as a captive juvenile in 2007			0
researchers describe it as having human - like eyes			0
although the forests where the monkeys live are remote , the species is hunted for bush meat and its status is vulnerable adult male lesula monkeys , found in the @entity39 is an @entity198 monkey well known to locals but newly known to science			2
adult males have a large , bare patch of bright blue skin on the buttocks , testicles and perineum , pictured ' with more than eight out of every ten living species awaiting discovery , i am shocked by our ignorance of our very own planet and in awe at the diversity , beauty and complexity of the biosphere and its inhabitants			2
' added prof @entity81 : ' we are calling for a @entity237 - like mission to discover 10 million species in the next 50 years			2
this would lead to discovering countless options for a more sustainable future while securing evidence of the origins of the biosphere			0
' the announcement , now in its sixth year , coincides with the anniversary of the birth of @entity248 - the 18th century @entity249 botanist responsible for the modern system of scientific names and classifications			0
the world 's smallest violet , pictured left , is only found in the @entity256 of the high @entity257 of @entity31			0
it is called the @entity260 violet after named after the race of little people on the island of @entity264 in @entity265 ’s @entity264			0
the fossil shown on the right is of a hanging fly and was found along with preserved leaves of a gingko - like tree , in @entity272 deposits from @entity62 ’s @entity273			0
this discovery is a rare example of an insect mimicking a gymnosperm 165 million years ago			0

other species include a *butterfly* discovered on @entity26 and a *harmless* snake pretending to be venomous
