the shocking moment when a cicada breaks through its creepy larva shell to emerge as a fully - grown vivid green adult , has been captured by a photographer			1
the stunning shots show the creature making its strange journey through its own former shell before unfurling its new wings to dry them out			2
photographer @entity10 was lucky enough to witness the strange process , which took around 30 minutes			1
the shocking moment ( pictured ) when a cicada breaks through its creepy larva shell to emerge as a fully - grown vivid green adult , has been captured by a photographer the bugs spend most of their lives beneath the @entity17 and can lie there for 17 years			1
they only venture above ground level to shed their ugly larva shells and sprout wings to become adults			2
once matured , they sing for a mate			0
mr @entity10 saw the cicada , still within its larva shell , clamber up a plant close to an exit tunnel in the ground where it had previously lived , and choose a leaf strong enough to support its weight - suitable for the creature 's transformation			1

once matured , they sing for a mate as the cicada begins to emerge , the amazing photographs show the stages at which the insect 's wings begin to unfurl			1
however , they are still soft and wet and need to be aired out , so the cicada stretches them out so they are able to dry			1
the whole process from ' birth ' to developing its fully grown wings took 30 minutes			1
mr @entity10 , 47 , captured the transformation at @entity54 in @entity55 , @entity56			1
the professional nature photographer from @entity58 , @entity59 , said : ' i was at the camping ground of the park and there were hundreds of horseflies around me , the car and the tent			2
when the cicada has wriggled out of its restrictive shell , it gradually unfurls its delicate wings , which are soft and wet ( pictured left ) and then spreads them fully to they can dry out ( pictured right ) it is hanging on to its discarded former ' nymphal case ' or shell ' the horseflies disappeared when it got dark at 6pm so i decided to explore the forest area at night			1
' equipped with cameras , flashes and a torch i walked along a small trail and after seeing a few katydids and spiders , i found a cicada larva crawling on the forest floor			0
' i watched and waited for an hour until it found a decent spot to rest and start the metamorphosis on a twig			0
' after two hours nothing happened so i lost my patience and went back to my tent to sleep - but all i could think about was the cicada larva			0
' kept awake by the thought of missing a great photographic opportunity , mr @entity10 left his tent at around midnight and walked back to the spot where he had seen the cicada			2
' right on time the cicada larva started its metamorphosis and i grabbed my camera and took all the pictures of the different stages , ' he said			2
cicadas live underground as nymphs for most of their lives , at depths ranging from about 30 centimetres to 2.5 metres			0
the nymphs feed on root juice and have strong front legs for digging			0
they construct an exit tunnel to the surface and emerge to molt ( pictured ) on a nearby plant for the last time to emerge as adults ' i was so lucky			0
after about 30 minutes the metamorphosis was done and i could calmly go back with a good conscience for a nice sleep			1
' mr @entity10 fulfilled a lifetime ambition of photographing a cicada emergence from start to finish			2
he said : ' i 've wanted to photograph a cicada larva for many years so i could get all the different stages from their birth			0
' in the past i 've seen loads of empty nymphal cases hanging on twigs or tree trunks but i finally managed to see the whole process this time			0

professional photographer @entity10 took the pictures in @entity54 in @entity55 , @entity56
the transformation of bug to adult insect took approximately 30 minutes
when the *vibrant* cicada emerges , it gradually spreads its soft and wet wings , which need to be dried out
