they came to pay homage to @entity3 but , by time up , it was bunnets doffed to @entity6			0
all the new manager ’s rhetoric on energy , tempo and speed manifested itself in the @entity13 ’s first outing at @entity14 as a much - praised @entity16 side were blown away by a performance worthy of champions			1
the cheers that greeted @entity6 ’s team at the interval and the final whistle were palpably louder than experienced at a domestic fixture here in some time — and @entity3 has to take his share of the credit for helping to shape the mood			2
instant impact : @entity30 scored in his first game for @entity32 after just four minutes double trouble : @entity34 celebrates doubling @entity32 's lead as the @entity36 thrashed @entity16 @entity32 : @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity30 , @entity42 ( @entity43 69 ) , @entity44 ( @entity45 45 ) , @entity46 ( @entity47 70 ) , commons , @entity49 subs not used : @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 @entity16 : @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 ( @entity61 75 ) , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 ( @entity65 40 ) , @entity66 ( @entity67 57 ) subs not used : @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 ref : @entity73 att : 44,484 once booed in the act of raising a championship flag at @entity14 , history has been kind to the club ’s returning saviour and he was suitably cheered to the rafters			1
he responded with a raised thumb before addressing the crowd thus : ‘ what an honour it is to be here — just to be here at @entity14 with you			0
things can go up , and things can go down			0
‘ @entity32 , i hope , will go on forever			0
three years as champions is something to celebrate			0
’ after unfurling the flag , he conducted the crowd in a rendition of @entity93 while making his way across the pitch to his seat in the @entity97 , the first section of the ground restructured under his revolutionary stewardship			0
they were selling @entity3 ’s trademark headgear in the club store and , as the crowd revelled in their tribute , the current chief executive , @entity103 , could put away his tin hat as the supporters ’ protestation at his own frugal stewardship was put on ice			2
it helps , of course , when the team is functioning so well			0
yes , @entity16 were abject and never came close to delivering on the promise of the back - to - back victories claimed at the start of this season			1
that 'll do nicely : @entity44 makes it 3 - 0 wiith a well - taken finish before half - time with five different players on the scoresheet including home debut goals for @entity30 and @entity49 , @entity6 ’s team were a delight			1
in @entity46 , they had the game ’s best performer , even if the @entity133 would have been disappointed to depart the fray without netting a goal			2
now in his seventies , @entity3 looks frailer than the figure who rescued the club from bankruptcy 20 years ago , but he also seemed relaxed and having more fun as he enjoyed a rare trip from @entity143			0
he was still posing for photographs as both teams came within inches of opening the scoring			0
@entity42 tried first , striking the post from distance and then @entity150 , included at right - back after @entity152 sustained a calf injury in the warm - up , was shrugged off by @entity64 , who found @entity155 with an exquisite pass marginally more precise than the finish , which crept wide			0
captain fantastic : @entity40 wheels away after making it 4 - 0 in the second half @entity16 clearly fancied their chances of maintaining their 100 - per - cent start to the season but , sprightly as they were , their inability to defend a corner - kick made the result certain before half an hour had passed			1
@entity30 printed his name on the scoresheet when @entity58 headed @entity34 ’ corner straight into the on - loan debutant ’s path			1
@entity30 has been recruited from @entity173 to stop goals but he conjured an instinctive finish that arrowed into the top corner			1
the second goal was even more straightforward , @entity46 providing the set - piece cross and commons enjoying the novelty of a headed goal to open his account this season			0
no 3 came from open play but featured the same level of @entity16 ineptitude			1
@entity58 again contributed with a slack pass to @entity62 , who delayed too long on the ball , allowing @entity44 to nip in and shoot past @entity54			2
brace : @entity49 scored twice after the interval to add further gloss to the scoreline @entity16 were actually lucky to go in three behind			1
@entity46 could have bagged a hat - trick as he peppered @entity54 ’s goal , while @entity49 shook the goal - frame to its foundations with a powerful drive			1
@entity37 started his first competitive game in over two years at @entity200 in midweek and continued with the same calm authority , saving at the feet of @entity63 early on and then turning the same player ’s shot wide following @entity40 ’s lapse after the break			2
the stand - in captain made amends as he glanced home @entity46 ’s free - kick for the fourth and then @entity49 got in on the act , nodding in from close range after @entity46 ’ corner was headed across goal by @entity150			1
@entity57 pulled a goal back with a deflected shot but a rapid counter-attack saw @entity32 restore the five - goal advantage			1
substitutes @entity43 and @entity45 were the creators , the @entity221 ’s overlap resulting in a cross to the back post where @entity49 squeezed home his finish			2
after the trauma of @entity226 , @entity6 no longer need cringe at the mention of a 6 - 1 scoreline .			0

debutant @entity30 put the hosts in front after just four minutes
@entity34 , @entity44 and @entity40 all netted
@entity49 scored two late goals to add gloss to the final score
@entity57 *registered* a *consolation* goal for @entity16
