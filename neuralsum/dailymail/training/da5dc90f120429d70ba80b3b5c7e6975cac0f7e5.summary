a wire - tapping lawsuit in @entity1 against @entity2 could cost the internet giant billions of dollars or nothing , depending on the result of a search of two hard company hard drives			2
22 plaintiffs accuse the search engine company of vacuuming personal data off their @entity13 networks with its roving @entity15 cars between 2008 and 2010			1
if successful the lawsuit would be a landmark judgement , as online corporations have faced criticism but rarely judgments for their handling of users ' privacy			0
snooped : @entity2 is accused of indiscriminately gathering data from unsecured @entity13 networks with @entity15 cars the @entity15 cars were deployed with 360 - degree camera systems to capture images for @entity15 and @entity29			1
when the @entity15 cars were announced , @entity2 did not reveal they were also loaded with wireless analyzers , tools designed to ' sample , collect , decode , and analyze ' data sent over accessible @entity13 networks			1
that led to @entity15 cars vacuuming up huge amounts of ' payload ' data , which includes passwords , email and multimedia like videos and photos			2
even data from @entity46 internet protocols , such as the internet phone service @entity48 , may have been collected			0
@entity49 reports that the case stalled while @entity2 fought to appeal the wiretapping accusation , claiming that data on unsecured wireless networks was equivalent to that on am / @entity56 transmissions			0
the @entity57 declined to hear @entity2 's case in june			1
mapping : @entity15 cars were intended to map the globe and capture photos for @entity15 and @entity29 rogue : @entity62 added code that turned @entity15 cars into vacuums of personal data , which @entity2 alleges he did on his own even as the lawsuit goes forward , proof will need to be found that personal data was collected by searching two hard drives held as evidence in @entity1			1
both sides have been ordered to settle on a neutral expert to comb through the hard drives to find traces of data being picked up			0
once over that hurdle , the plaintiffs will have an easier time winning what would be a watershed online privacy lawsuit , as they do not have to prove they suffered damage from @entity2 's actions or that @entity2 initiated the project maliciously			2
in the past , @entity2 claimed that the wireless analyzer program was the work of a ' rogue ' programmer , which the corporation only found out about after it was initiated			2
the employee , first referred to as ' @entity89 , ' was later outed as @entity62 , a respected @entity90 expert on wireless networks , according to the @entity92			0
@entity15 cars throughout the @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 collected data , triggering various investigations			0
in 2013 , the search engine company said it would pay $ 7million to settle with over 30 states and the @entity101 over its data collection practices			0
the ongoing lawsuit , which has yet to move to the class action phase , would net up to $ 10,000 in damages for each affected user , leading a windfall judgement .			1

22 plaintiffs will need to find evidence of their personal data on two @entity2 servers held in evidence
the suit involves a wireless analyzer used in @entity2 's @entity15 cars from 2008 to 2010 that gathered data sent over personal @entity13
lawsuit is seeking up to $ 10,000 in damages for each affected user , which could total billions
@entity2 blames the use of the analyzer on a ' rogue ' engineer named @entity62 , who it says added the code without *authorization*
