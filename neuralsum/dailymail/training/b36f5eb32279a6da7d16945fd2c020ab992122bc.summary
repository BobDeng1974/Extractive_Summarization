the father - of - two , from @entity13 , @entity14 , underwent eight hours of surgery last december as surgeons battled to remove the tumour			1
hope : @entity6 , who has twice been told he will die from cancer , has defied the odds to get married to partner @entity20 ( pictured ) and celebrate his daughter 's first birthday mr @entity6 , 44 , had already survived four brain tumour operations when doctors revealed a fifth deadly brain tumour had appeared only weeks after the birth of his daughter @entity11 ( pictured ) last october they also warned him that this fifth lifesaving operation would be his last chance of survival			1
miraculously , he pulled through and has now married his partner @entity20 , 33 , and celebrated @entity11 's first birthday			1
mr @entity6 said : ' my partner @entity20 and i were looking forward to the birth of our second child in october last year			1
' but not long after @entity11 was born , i was told i had another tumour			1
' there is nothing i love more than my children and my wife and i knew i had to survive to see them growing up			0
' when @entity11 was born , i was holding her and knew i 'd do everything i could to be around for her for as long as possible			2
' i knew i had to fight , there was just no other way around it			0
so i had the final operation to remove it three months later			2
under the knife : doctors have now told mr @entity6 that , following the removal of a fifth tumour last december ( pictured ) , his brain is unable to take any more surgery despite five bouts of surgery , he remains positive , saying : ' five tumours down and i 'm still here			1
they are always on the left hand side of my brain			0
i have many problems with my left side , i 'm deaf in that ear and blind in that eye ' ' then in july this year , @entity20 and i decided to get married as we realised life is too short - especially when the doctors told me after this operation there was nothing they could do if i get another tumour			1
' mr @entity6 , who also has a seven - year - old son called @entity71 , added : ' celebrating @entity11 's first birthday in october this year exactly 12 months since my diagnosis was such a special day			1
' we went off to the @entity75 camping as a family for the occasion - i just never thought i 'd see it			0
' mr @entity6 , a bar manager , was fit and healthy until he began to suffer headaches in 2006			2
an mri scan revealed he had a tumour the size of a baseball in the left side of his brain			2
celebrating : mr @entity6 with daughter @entity11 , celebrating her first birthday in the @entity75 borders			1
he said : ' i never thought i 'd see that day ' in july this year , the couple decided to get married			2
mr @entity6 said : ' we realised life is too short - especially when doctors told me after this operation there was nothing they could do if i get another tumour ' doctors broke the news that he did n't have long to live and told him to say goodbye to his family before having an emergency operation to have it removed			1
he survived and tried to get on with life , but in may 2007 he began to feel ill again and , following an mri scan , was diagnosed with a second brain tumour , which was again successfully removed			1
then in 2009 doctors found yet another tumour			2
again , mr @entity6 was warned his chances of survival were slim because of the depth of the growth inside his brain			2
he underwent a marathon 12 - hour operation in march that year where his entire face was pulled down and part of his skull removed as doctors worked to remove the lump			1
but he was dealt a further twist of fate when doctors found a fourth brain tumour and he was rushed back into surgery for a six - hour operation			1
even as he recovered , he fell ill again after contracting meningitis and septicaemia			0
doctors have now told him that , following the removal of a fifth tumour , his brain is unable to take any more surgery			1
determined : mr @entity6 added : ' i owe it to my family to fight with all that i can ' family man : mr @entity6 said : ' before this happened to me , i was always at the office , now i just want to be home with my kids			2
i 'm on many different drugs now and i 'm looking to the future ' despite this , he remains positive , saying : ' five tumours down and i 'm still here			0
they are always on the left hand side of my brain			0
' i have many problems with my left side , i 'm deaf in that ear and blind in that eye			0
' the moments when doctors tell you that you have to say your final goodbyes are just heartbreaking			0
' but there is always hope			0
and i still have a life to live			0
people always say i 'm a very positive person but i have to be			0
' he added : ' i owe it to my family to fight with all that i can and just live my life as normally as i can			0
' before this happened to me , i was always at the office , now i just want to be home with my kids			0
' i 'm on many different drugs now and i 'm looking to the future			0
' i 'm keeping my fingers crossed until december and hoping for 12 months clear			0
