graduate students have used a 3d printer to make a limb for a six - year - old boy born without a right arm			1
@entity5 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , was given the new prosthetic arm on friday by a team headed by @entity7 student @entity10			1
the limb took seven weeks for the team to build in their free time and cost $ 350 - compared to the $ 40,000 that doctors told @entity5 's family a prosthetic arm would cost			1
after the little boy put on the arm , which senses muscles in his shoulder and opens and closes , he grinned and gave his mother a hug - the first time he had been able to put two arms around her			1
' i feel everything good , even my robot arm			2
it 's not even heavy			2
' the team started building the arm after @entity10 , an aerospace engineering phd student , began thinking about how to help the family after reading a letter @entity5 's mother posted online			1
on a website for a community devoted to making prosthetic hands , @entity49 that because her son had been born without an arm , their insurance company would n't cover the costs			1
the costs are so steep for childhood prosthetics because of their quick rate of growth and the need to always be replacing the limbs			2
@entity10 was driving his car when he heard a story on the radio about a man in @entity64 who used a 3d printer to make a new hand			1
' i was really inspired , ' he said			0
' when i got back , i talked to my colleagues and friends and said , " we can do this "			0
' first hug : afterwards , the first thing @entity5 did was run to his mother for his first ever hug with two arms trying it out : @entity5 shakes hands with a reporter after receiving the new limb on friday			2
his family had struggled to afford the $ 40,000 that doctors said it would cost to give the boy an arm getting used to it : @entity5 plays with a ball next to his grandfather after getting the arm , which reacts to muscles in his shoulder			1
he can open and close the hand and the battery lasts for a whole day the team - including friends who study electrical , mechanical and civil engineering - got to work on the arm , which is activated by the electromyography muscle energy on @entity5 's bicep , @entity93 reported			1
by july , they had a large working prototype and they then got to work on making a smaller version			0
while the batteries can be bought from stores , @entity105 , one of the biggest commercial 3d printer makers in the nation , also donated some of the supplies			0
' my mother taught us that we ’re supposed to help change the world , ' @entity10 said			2
' we ’re supposed to help make it better			0
that 's why we did it			0
the look on @entity5 ’s face when he used it for the first time was priceless			2
' he added that the boy seemed to get used to the arm pretty quickly			2
' the first thing he did when he could actually control it a little bit was hug his mother , ' he said			0
' he said it was their first real hug			0
there was n't a dry eye in the room			0
' life changing : @entity5 is pictured grinning with his new arm with @entity10 , who came up with the idea thankful : @entity137 , pictured hugging @entity5 , is now developing another printed arm for a second family when he out - grows the arm , it 'll cost just $ 20 for a new hand and $ 40 to $ 50 for a new forearm			1
@entity10 later put the plans of the design online so that others could download them for free and improve them			1
' i have no doubt that the international community will try to move this technology forward and lower the cost , ' he said			0
@entity10 , a @entity153 , heads to @entity154 in august to work for the @entity155 , but he has already promised to help another family with an arm , so he 'll remain committed to the project even when he 's abroad			1
' i think 3d printing is revolutionizing our world in many ways , ' he said			0
' i believe changing the world of prosthetics is very real			0
there 's no reason why this approach should n’t work on adults too			0

@entity5 was born without a right arm and his family could not afford the steep cost to get him a prosthetic one
@entity7 student @entity10 read about their plight on a forum and *decided* to help after hearing about a man who printed a limb
it took a team of friends , seven weeks and just $ 350 to build the boy 's new arm , which opens and closes by sensing the his shoulder muscles
@entity10 has shared his plans online in the hope others will improve them
