by @entity0 last updated at 3:38 pm on 2nd september 2011 migrant boom : @entity2 , the outgoing business chief , said foreign workers are better qualified and have a better attitude migrant workers land the majority of new jobs created in @entity9 because they are more hardworking than their @entity9 counterparts , a business leader claimed today			1
@entity2 , on his last day as director general of the @entity12 , said foreign workers flooding into the country had brought about a dramatic change in the labour market			1
he dismissed suggestions that overseas employees get jobs because they are prepared to work for low wages - but said they had a stronger work ethic			2
mr @entity2 said that the government would have to ' radically change ' the welfare system so that it never paid not to be in work			1
nine out of ten people who joined the workforce last year were foreign nationals , official figures have revealed			1
@entity30 was widely criticised for a promise to provide ' @entity9 jobs , for @entity9 workers ' as figures showed new jobs were going to economic migrants			1
between 1997 and 2010 , more than half of the rise in employment in the @entity9 was accounted for by foreign nationals			2
mr @entity2 said foreign workers are often better qualified and more enthusiastic			1

nine out of ten new jobs last year went to foreign workers ' overwhelmingly , business has adopted migrant workers for the simple reason that they are often better educated and have a stronger work ethic than local people , ' he said			1
fears about the health of the economy were fanned today after two key surveys revealed a worrying slowdown in the construction industry			1
new orders fell by 16.3 per cent in the second quarter of this year to their lowest level since 1980 , the @entity59 revealed			2
and the sector grew in august at its slowest pace this year as the housing sector continued to contract and confidence hit its lowest level for seven months , according to a @entity70 / @entity69 survey			2
the surveys suggest the sector , which has seen strong growth in recent months , could be running out of momentum and will add to fears that the @entity9 's economy is in danger of slipping back into recession			1
the gloomy surveys suggest the sector , which grew by 0.5 per cent in the second quarter of the year , is being dragged downwards as confidence is eroded amid the government spending cuts and the general global economic slowdown			1
the manufacturing sector is also suffering a slowdown , according to recent figures , while the powerhouse services sector is still in growth but is being squeezed as disposable income is hit by inflation			2

he said : ' the construction sector faces an extremely challenging environment , which threatens to weigh down appreciably on activity over the coming months			0
' ' it is not about paying lower wages			0
if the government is serious about @entity9 jobs for @entity9 workers , then not only do they have to improve the education system , but also radically change the welfare system so it never pays not to work			1
' in a bid to kick - start the economy , business chief mr @entity2 also said there needed to be a bonfire of red tape and an end to ' endless tinkering ' with regulations			1
' there have been six major changes to parental rights in the last 10 years , ' he said			0
' small businesses in particular are worried about getting it wrong and ending up in front of an employment tribunal , so the default is often only to employ an extra person as a last resort			0
' this is hardly the right outcome when we have 2.5million people unemployed in the @entity9			0
' figures released yesterday raise questions about whether the government ’s drive to get millions off benefits and into work can be achieved without further curbs on immigration			0
they will also increase pressure to reform the bloated benefits system			0
the figures , produced by the @entity59 , reveal that employment among working age people rose by 181,000 in the @entity143 ’s first year			2
yet employment levels among @entity9 nationals rose by just 14,000 , or less than 8 per cent of the total			0
employment among @entity149 nationals rose by 163,000 during the period – equal to more than 90 per cent of the total			0
@entity153 general secretary @entity152 said that it is not true that it pays to be unemployed			0
' benefit levels are already very low in the @entity9			0
