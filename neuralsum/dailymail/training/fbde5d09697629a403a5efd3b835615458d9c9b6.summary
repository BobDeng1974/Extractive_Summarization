a therapeutic harpist , @entity4 plays for hospital patients to help them deal with pain and anxiety			1
she thought if the soothing sounds helped calm humans , it would work for the primates too			2
' i would love to see every zoo have a harpist			2
i think it benefits the animals , ' said @entity4 , a quick - to - smile woman			1
@entity63 , a zookeeper at @entity64 , said @entity4 has played for all the animals at the zoo			1
some animals appear ambivalent , @entity63 said , but the harp music ' seems to be a really calming thing for the apes to listen to			2

chimpanzees like to listen to music - but have very specific tastes , researchers revealed earlier this year			0
while preferring silence to music from the @entity82 , chimpanzees like to listen to the different rhythms of music from @entity85 and @entity86 , researchers found			0
the research is the first to discover primates have a preference for music , according to the @entity91 , which published the study			0
the researchers admit they made the discovery by mistake , said study coauthor @entity96 , phd , of @entity97			0
' our objective was not to find a preference for different cultures ' music , ' she said			0
' we used cultural music from @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity105 to pinpoint specific acoustic properties			0
' past research has focused only on @entity109 music and has not addressed the very different acoustic features of non-western music			0
while nonhuman primates have previously indicated a preference among music choices , they have consistently chosen silence over the types of music previously tested			0
previous research has found that some nonhuman primates prefer slower tempos , but the current findings may be the first to show that they display a preference for particular rhythmic patterns , according to the study			0
' although @entity109 music , such as pop , blues and classical , sound different to the casual listener , they all follow the same musical and acoustic patterns			0
' therefore , by testing only different @entity109 music , previous research has essentially replicated itself , ' the authors wrote			0
the study was published in @entity91 's @entity138 : @entity139 and @entity140			0
