just days after the @entity2 urged members of the military to clear their social media accounts of anything that might draw attention to them for fear of an @entity11 attack in the homeland , one very important members of the armed forces has gone out and ignored their request			1
@entity15 winner @entity14 , who served in the @entity16 for four years , has used both his @entity17 and @entity18 to taunt members of @entity11 , calling them ' cowards			1
' and now , many around the country are applauding his actions			0
' that means terrorism is working			2
' he then added , ' i refuse to let these idealistic , radical bullies change the way that i live			0
' @entity2 officials had released this warning on monday in fear there may be a copycat attack in the @entity46 similar to the one that happened this past october in @entity49 , when two soldiers were killed in two separate incidents by young men who claimed they were @entity11 followers in the span of just one week			1
@entity14 does not seem to be concerned though , posting his first amusing threat to @entity17 on tuesday , which showed him smoking a pipe and reading a @entity16 handbook			1
' wonder if any @entity11 members want to drop by and join my book club , ' wrote @entity14			1
he also wrote on tuesday , in a post on the website scout , ' if @entity11 is using social media to track me , that 's a dream come true in my book			1
these guys are a bunch of bullies that just prey on the weak			0
' ' i ca n't travel over there anymore now that i 'm out of the @entity16 , so having them come to me would help out a lot			0
@entity11 targeting the @entity46 military is like a sheep targeting a lion			2
hopefully one of these a * * holes actually shows up			0
they 'll definitely get more than they want at my place ! ' he then closed by saying , ' i 'll take the responsibility to be the liaison for the military			2
i live in @entity85 , @entity86 — oops , is that too much information ? oh well			0
' they wo n't win : @entity14 also said if he backs down that would mean ' terrorism is winning ' @entity46 hero : @entity14 received his medal for repeatedly entering a kill zone in @entity94 and saving 36 troops @entity14 was awarded the @entity15 in 2011 after repeatedly charging into a kill zone during a 2009 ambush in @entity98 , @entity94 in search of four of his missing soldiers			1
he was able to rescue 36 troops and kill eight @entity102 attackers despite being shot in the arms			2
he was not however able to save his four fellow soldiers and friends who he went in search of , though he did make sure to go back and carry each of their bodies to safety			0
' because of your humble example , our kids — especially back in @entity85 , @entity86 , in small towns all across @entity46 — they ’ll know that no matter who you are or where you come from , you can do great things as a citizen and as a member of the @entity46 family , ' said president @entity123 at his ceremony .			0

@entity14 , a @entity15 winner , has taken to social media to write amusing taunts to members of @entity11
in one @entity17 post he invites @entity11 members to his book club , and on @entity18 he *labels* them ' cowards '
this just days after the @entity2 urged military members to be careful on social media for fear of an attack on the homeland
@entity14 says he refuses to back down because that would mean ' terrorism is winning '
@entity14 was awarded the @entity15 for *returning* to kill zone in @entity94 repeatedly in 2009 and saving 36 troops when he was just *21*
