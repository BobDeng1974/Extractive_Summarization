website streetartnews said : ‘ at the break of dawn , the @entity154 street artist showed up with a maintenance van and covered all the sides with tarpaulin to execute his new stencil			0
‘ while not officially confirmed by his website , this piece has all the @entity12 characteristics in narrative , style and execution			2
’ @entity16 street artist @entity167 said : ‘ it ’s definitely @entity12			1
graffiti is definitely all about location			0
' that ’s why he ’s come to @entity16 , to do something about @entity19			1

a spokesman for @entity19 said : ' this is the first time we have ever been asked to comment on art. ' @entity185 , director of commissioning at @entity187 said the artwork could be protected , with permission from the landlord			0
abroad : his work has not been confined to the @entity154 - the mysterious artist sprayed this image on the @entity195 @entity194 machine : this @entity12 image caught the eye of commuters after it mysteriously appeared in a bricked up window in 2007 in @entity201 , north @entity64 famous : the @entity203 ( left ) was sold in @entity64 in 2007 for £ 320,900 , while @entity204 and @entity205 ( right ) went for £ 288,000 high price : keep it @entity208 , a 2007 @entity12 , sold in @entity209 in 2008 for £ 1,111,900			1
it is the most expensive piece of his artwork ever sold ‘ the council can not condone graffiti which is put onto people 's property without their permission , ’ she said			0
‘ however , we recognise that the public do see work by @entity12 as significant pieces of public art and it is clear that this piece has been getting a huge amount of favourable attention			2
it would be a shame if it was removed or damaged			0
‘ as the artwork is on private property , it is the for the property owner to decide whether they would want it to be kept - they would need to consider the impact this may have on the residents of the property and the wider community			0
‘ although we still do not know if it is original work by @entity12 , given the public interest , we would be happy to help the owner find a solution which would protect it from tagging or other graffiti			0
