by @entity0 @entity2 brothers are getting stronger each day after they were saved by laser surgery while still in the womb			1
@entity5 and @entity6 will be four months old this week , despite being given only a 33 per cent chance of survival			1
their mother , @entity9 , has also seen her twins fight off blood poisoning and meningitis - and only now are they the normal size of newborns			1
@entity16 and @entity17 , now four months old , are thriving after surviving laser surgery in the womb			1
they had to have an operation after developing a potentially fatal condition called twin to twin transfusion syndrome			1
they are pictured with their mother , @entity9 , and sister , @entity28 the teacher , from @entity30 , @entity31 , had to undergo an operation after it was found the twins had developed a rare and potentially fatal condition known as twin to twin transfusion syndrome			1
the condition , in which one twin has a higher blood volume than the other , can occur in identical twins whose umbilical cords are attached to a shared placenta			1
it was spotted by a consultant at @entity46 during a routine scan , and sparked an extraordinary sequence of events that saw mrs @entity50 have surgery on the same day			1
she said : ‘ i was diagnosed with the condition in december , during a scan at 21 weeks into my pregnancy			1
‘ because the hospital knew i was expecting identical twins , i was having scans every two weeks			1
‘ i was very lucky because it can develop very rapidly and i was n't due another scan for a week , but my consultant said she would do it early as she was going on holiday			2
the babies were born at just 31 weeks but are now the size of average newborns			1
image shows @entity5 the babies were given just a 33 per cent chance of survival before the operation			1
image shows @entity16 ‘ she spotted signs of the condition and i was told to go to @entity74 in @entity75			1
‘ that was at noon and by 5pm i reached the hospital			2
they did an ultrasound and confirmed the condition			2
’ amazingly , an hour later professor @entity80 performed the surgery			1
mrs @entity50 said : ‘ he inserted a laser into my tummy and severed the connections between the babies to stop one baby taking too much from the other			0
’ things moved so rapidly , mrs @entity50 only just had time to call her husband @entity89 to let him know she was being operated on			0
she added : ‘ one minute i was at @entity46 and the next i was on the train			0
‘ my husband was at work so i had to make the decisions myself			0
he got there just as they started the surgery			2
twin to twin transfusion syndrome can affect identical twins who share a placenta			1
it is caused by abnormal connecting blood vessels in the twins ' placenta			2
this causes an imbalanced blood flow from one twin to the other			1
it leaves one baby with a greater blood volume than the other			1
it affects 10 to 15 per cent of identical twins who share a placenta			0
if it goes undetected , there is a very high risk of the babies dying or being left severely disabled			0
there are a number of treatment options , including laser treatment , but in some cases it is necessary to sacrifice one twin in a bid to save the other			2
source : @entity127 ‘ it was an awful decision to have to make because of the risk of the surgery , but there was no time to lose			2
the longer we waited , the higher the chance the babies could die or be brain damaged			1
’ the procedure was carried out under a local anaesthetic with mrs @entity50 , 32 , fully aware of what was happening to her and her babies			0
she said : ‘ they had a camera attached to the laser with a monitor nearby			0
‘ i could see what they were doing			0
i could see a little hand moving about and i prayed the babies would n't move and get caught by the laser			0
‘ it took 45 minutes and then i was sent to recover in a quiet room			0
another scan showed the babies were both well and i was allowed to go home			0
’ despite its success , the couple were told the chances of both twins surviving the surgery was only 33 per cent			1
they then had to face a 20 per cent chance of a miscarriage over the following six weeks			1
mrs @entity50 added : ‘ i 'd had two miscarriages before , so i was convinced i would lose them			0
‘ i went back to work because i did n't want to sit at home and panic			0
‘ at 29 weeks , my waters broke			2
however , i did n't go into labour for another two weeks , which gave them vital extra time			2
i was also given cortisone in that time to help the babies ' lungs develop			0
’ the twins arrived on february 12 by caesarean section			0
@entity5 weighed 3lb 12oz and his brother @entity16 weighed just 3lb 1oz			1
both had to overcome a potentially fatal infection of the stomach and blood poisoning , but survived thanks to @entity46 's neonatal unit			1
they went home to be with their sister , two - year - old @entity28 , on march 9 , but had to return after catching bacterial meningitis			2
however , they pulled through again and now weigh 8lb 3oz and 6lb 10oz			0
mrs @entity50 said : ‘ they are four months old now			2
people ask me how old they are and are very surprised when i tell them			0
‘ we owe professor @entity80 so much			0
without him , we would n't have our boys			0
we would have lost them			0
‘ we are really grateful to @entity46 neonatal unit as well			0
they were all wonderful there			0

@entity5 and @entity6 developed twin to twin transfusion syndrome
causes one to have greater blood volume than the other and can lead to brain damage or death - so needed life - saving surgery at 21 weeks gestation
their mother , @entity9 , was told they had just a 33 *%* chance of survival
amazingly , they survived the surgery and were born at 31 weeks gestation
they are now thriving and are about to turn four months old
