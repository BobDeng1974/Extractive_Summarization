by @entity0 published : 17:35 est , 1 february 2014 @entity2 : 17:35 est , 1 february 2014 to look at @entity4 , you would imagine that the head - turning blonde enjoys a jet - set life of frequent celebrity parties , swanky red - carpet events and lavish holidays with her famous hairdresser boyfriend , @entity11			1
but the reality is far from glamorous			2
for the 32 - year - old faces a daily battle with the rare and potentially life - threatening disease lupus			1
this chronic auto - immune condition , for which there is no cure , affects 50,000 people in the @entity20 – a staggering 90 per cent of whom are women			1
' i wo n't give in ' : @entity24 , 32 , girlfriend of @entity11 , 55 , suffers from lupus , which causes the body ¿ s immune system to turn on itself and start killing its own cells @entity30 causes the body ’s immune system to turn on itself and start killing its own cells , explains lupus expert professor @entity33 , academic director of rheumatology at @entity37 , @entity38 , and @entity4 ’s consultant			1
the primary symptoms are inflammation , pain and tissue damage			0
the inflammation can cause pain , heat , redness , swelling and loss of function , either internally to organs , or externally to the skin			0
@entity52 and external symptoms can even be suffered at the same time			0
then there are breathing problems and chronic fatigue			0
when the major organs are affected , survival for lupus sufferers is likely to be shorter than for those with only skin and / or joint disease related to lupus			1
lupus patients often suffer unpredictable flare - ups followed by periods of remission			1
it all means that late - night parties are off - limits for @entity4 : two glasses of wine would bring on a severe attack ; wearing high heels for more than an hour leaves her knees agonisingly painful ; and if she stays out later than midnight , it takes days to recover from what feels like chronic flu			1
her support : @entity4 says her boyfriend @entity11 sometimes has to help her get dressed in the morning as she is in so much pain some days @entity4 can not even make it out of bed , let alone get dressed and leave the house			1
she says : ‘ every day i wake with pain – a stinging sensation deep within my bones , which moves around the body			2
i also have chronic fatigue , so even if i have ten hours ’ sleep at night , i wake up utterly exhausted			0
‘ on bad days , my fingers are so swollen that i ca n’t make a fist , and @entity11 has to help me get dressed			1
sometimes it flares up for a few days , sometimes for several weeks , and i can be bedridden			0
i feel so sorry for @entity11 as it is hard living with someone with lupus – but he ’s always been absolutely brilliant about it			1
’ @entity4 first experienced lupus symptoms when she was 17			1
‘ i began to feel pain and swelling in my fingers			0
i was studying computer science at college , and i thought it was repetitive strain injury			0
‘ the pain then spread to my wrists , but when i went to see my doctor , i was first told it was growing pains , and then when i changed my consultant , rheumatoid arthritis			0
i tried to manage the condition with painkillers			0
’ the condition went undiagnosed , as is the case in many sufferers			0
prof @entity33 explains : ‘ @entity30 can be very hard to diagnose as it mimics other diseases			1
it is diagnosed via the symptoms , by taking family history and by a series of blood tests			0
treatment includes anti-inflammatory drugs , steroids and new ‘ ‘ biologic ’ ’ drugs which target the auto - immune system			1
’ ‘ i liken lupus to friendly fire in a war situation , ’ says prof @entity33			2
‘ our immune system is like a radar – every day we are bombarded by millions of bacteria and viruses			1
' the immune system identifies and fights these off , but with lupus the body can not distinguish between our own cells and the invading forces			1
’ lupus can cause strokes , excessive bleeding , kidney , heart and lung failure and blood clots			2
in the 1950s , sufferers had only a 50 per cent chance of surviving for five years , but now about 90 per cent will survive for at least 15 years from diagnosis			0
treatments are advancing swiftly with a new range of biologic drugs – such as @entity154			0
the disease ’s profile was raised when pop singer @entity157 said there was lupus in her family but so far she had had no symptoms			1
@entity162 @entity4 ’s pain continued throughout her college course and into her early 20s when she worked as a trader in the @entity166			1
she continued to try to manage the pain , but at 23 she switched careers and started working in the hairdressing industry , which is where she later met @entity11			1
the couple , who live in @entity38 , have now been together for five years			0
hairdressing proved tricky , due to the swelling and pain in her hands , but she persevered as doctors continued to diagnose arthritis			0
finally , last year , she saw another specialist and was told she had lupus			2
‘ i was really shocked , but it made sense and it was a relief to know what was wrong with me and what i was up against , ’ she says			0
the exact cause of the disease remains unknown but lupus is thought to have a genetic link , and @entity4 ’s family now believe her maternal grandmother had lupus as she experienced similar symptoms			1
since the diagnosis , @entity4 has tried an array of medications and requires weekly hospital care for treatment and monitoring			2
her latest treatment , a new drug called @entity154 , is a powerful biological therapy that is designed to reduce the number of b - cells , the type her auto - immune system over-produces			1
the @entity154 treatment was combined with a one - off shot of a chemotherapy drug called cyclophosphamide			2
she has had two treatments of the @entity154 , but takes further drugs and painkillers to manage her condition and her blood is screened in hospital			0
‘ @entity154 is like gold dust and costs about £ 5,000 per infusion via the @entity217 so i ’m really grateful to have it , and it is helping as i have noticed some of my symptoms ease slightly since my second infusion , ’ she says			0
she met @entity11 , 55 , when she joined his @entity223 salon as a trainee hairdresser and has been able to benefit from her partner ’s unwavering support			1
@entity4 says : ‘ he ’s always known about my pain and fatigue , since i first started working with him , and he has always been incredibly supportive and caring			2
‘ he is constantly researching new treatments – we are now drinking lactose - free milk , as he thinks that might help			2
’ despite the severity of illness , @entity4 is determined it will not affect her career			2
‘ last june i launched my own fashion label , she wears a crown , and i would love to have a family with @entity11 , but sadly with lupus you often miscarry so i know it wo n’t be easy			1
’ she is now trying to raise awareness of lupus			2
‘ i ’m doing all i can to support the charity @entity20 to help fellow sufferers			0
in 2015 , i ’m planning to do a husky sledge ride across @entity249 to raise funds			0
‘ being well and strong enough for that is my goal for the next year			0
i wo n’t be beaten by this			0
