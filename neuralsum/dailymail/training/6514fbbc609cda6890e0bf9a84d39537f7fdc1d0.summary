by @entity0 published : 19:09 est , 16 march 2014 updated : 20:29 est , 16 march 2014 pressure : @entity3 has been encouraged to raise to threshold for the 40 per cent tax rate by members of his own party pressure is mounting on @entity9 to raise the 40p tax threshold – after he reportedly said that people did not mind paying the higher rate because it made them feel like a ' success '			1
the row over the millions of workers being dragged into paying the higher rate of tax threatens to overshadow this week ’s @entity19 , with a string of senior @entity21 expressing concern			1
business leaders also weighed in yesterday , with the @entity24 saying the system was ‘ highly damaging to @entity27 plc ’			1
but the chancellor is expected to reject their pleas – instead using the budget to again raise the threshold for basic rate income tax to £ 10,500			2
yesterday the chancellor faced extraordinary claims that he told a private meeting of @entity36 there were ‘ advantages ’ for the party that more people were being pulled into paying the higher rate			1
‘ it means they feel they are a success and joining the aspirational classes , ’ he was said to have told them			2
‘ that means they are more likely to think like conservatives and vote @entity49			0
if they are paying 40p tax they have a greater interest in cutting government spending because they are paying for it			0
’ a @entity58 source insisted : ‘ @entity3 did not say people enjoy paying 40p			2
he was explaining that even though more people are paying a marginal tax rate of 40 per cent , the important thing is that they are paying less tax overall			0
’ but two mps from the @entity49 ’ 1922 backbench committee who were present at the meeting in @entity68 last month said the account of the meeting was accurate			2
one said : ‘ he did say it made people feel they were a success			2
there was a sense of dumbfounded shock around the table			0
’ since the election , 1.4million workers have been dragged into the 40p tax band , which kicks in at £ 41,450			1
there are 4.4 million people paying the higher rate , up from 3.02million when the @entity85 came to power and 1.35million in 1988			0
senior @entity21 , including two former chancellors and @entity89 mayor @entity88 , have urged mr @entity9 to indicate he wants to use further budgets to ease the 40p squeeze on middle - class professionals			1
urged : @entity88 , right , has previously encouraged the chancellor to act over tax a survey of firms by the @entity24 identified growing concern over the number of families paying the tax			1
it found an increase in the higher - rate threshold to £ 50,000 had emerged as their top priority for personal taxation and warned the current system was damaging the country			0
the chancellor said yesterday that anyone earning up to £ 100,000 was better off thanks to the government ’s dramatic increases in the personal allowance			0
‘ it helps people whether they ’re earning £ 20,000 or £ 50,000			0
it ’s only people right at the top , people on incomes of over £ 100,000 , who do n’t get the benefit , ’ he said			0
mr @entity9 said he was ‘ incredibly proud ’ of what the @entity49 had done to raise the personal allowance , mainly helping basic - rate taxpayers – who are better off by more than £ 700 a year as a result			1
intervention : former chancellor @entity130 said mr @entity9 ' ca n't go on forever ' without raising the threshold ‘ this has been an income tax cut for 25million people			1
it ’s taken the lowest - paid two million out of tax			0
‘ and the benefits have been felt by those on the higher incomes , on the higher threshold – those earning £ 40,000 , £ 50,000 , £ 60,000 – so i think that is a misconception in this debate , ’ he said			0
the chancellor hinted that he might look at action on the 40p threshold if the @entity49 won a majority in next year ’s election			2
@entity149 , director general of the @entity24 , said : ‘ what was intended as a tax to hit the very wealthiest has now entrapped millions of hard - working people			1
‘ aspirational middle - earners now suffer an income tax rate of 40 per cent , plus 2 per cent @entity155 , before their incomes exceed even twice median earnings			0
‘ this is a completely unacceptable situation			1
it represents a disincentive for aspiring junior managers and professionals to accept promotions or move jobs and , accordingly , it is highly damaging to @entity27 plc. ’ former @entity49 chancellor @entity130 said : ‘ you ca n’t go on for ever and for ever increasing the personal allowance and not increasing the 40 per cent tax threshold , because you ’re just driving more and more people into that band			1
‘ it also is a very , very expensive policy because in order to keep the number of people not paying tax constant , you have to keep adjusting it and adjusting it each year			1
‘ when the 40p rate was introduced by @entity181 , it applied to one in 20 people			0
it now applies to one in six people and by 2015 next year , there ’ll be 6million people paying this			0

@entity88 and two former chancellors have intervened in tax row
@entity130 , chancellor from 1990 - 1993 , attacked ' very expensive ' policy
@entity24 also attacked the ' unacceptable situation '
yesterday mr @entity9 faced claims he told @entity49 mps that people like being in the higher tax band because it makes them feel successful
but @entity58 sources denied that mr @entity9 had made the *remarks*
