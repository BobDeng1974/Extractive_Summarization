by @entity0 last updated at 11:49 am on 5th february 2012 tens of thousands of @entity2 flooded @entity4 city centre today to demand an end to @entity7 's rule			1
the crowds braved @entity9 ( -4f ) temperatures to protest a month before a presidential election mr @entity7 is still expected to win			0
the march - which drew 120,000 people , according to organisers - was the third mass demonstration since mr @entity7 's party won a parliamentary election on december 4 with the help of what appeared to be widespread fraud			2
no more hot air : protesters storm the streets of @entity4 clutching balloons and holding a banner reading , ' @entity2 without @entity7 and for fair elections ! ' @entity27 calls : demonstrators brave the chill to demand @entity7 give up ahead of the march 4 presidential polls battle of wills : a @entity2 woman dreamily holds an @entity34 sign aloft at the protest , as the prime minister threatens to reclaim his old @entity38 job the election and mr @entity7 's decision to reclaim the presidency proved the last straw for @entity2 increasingly unhappy with the creeping authoritarianism during his 12 - year rule			1
the rallies - which have brought together liberals , leftists and nationalists - are the biggest in @entity2 since the demonstrations that led to the collapse of the @entity51 20 years ago			1
today activists wearing the white ribbons that have become the symbol of the protest movement and chanting ' @entity56 ' marched to a square across the river from the @entity38 to stage the rally in the freezing weather			2
it appeared to be even bigger than december 's protests , despite the bitter cold , in a clear statement that @entity34 sentiment rages as strongly as ever			0
shaky ground : @entity7 meets with election monitors in @entity4 on wednesday thousands of police monitored the peaceful protest , as a 5,000 - strong @entity34 protest took place simultaneously in @entity72 , and smaller rallies were held in several dozen other cities across @entity2			1
a rival rally in @entity4 in support of mr @entity7 drew no more than 20,000 people - most of them teachers , municipal workers , employees of state - owned companies or trade union activists , who had been brought on buses provided by their employers			1
the anti-putin protests have been driven by members of the educated and urban middle class			0
mr @entity7 has ignored many of their demands , including for a repeat election , but has tried to assuage their anger with vague promises to introduce liberal reforms and to guarantee a fair presidential vote on march 4			0
the protest leaders hope to stage another rally a week before the election to keep up the pressure on mr @entity7			2
he has attempted to counter the anger by focusing on his core support group of blue - collar workers , farmers , public servants and the elderly			1
he also has tried to discredit the protesters by casting their leaders as @entity107 lackeys working to weaken @entity2			2
the presidential race pits mr @entity7 against three leaders of parliamentary parties who have run against him in the past , and one new opponent - the billionaire owner of the @entity115 basketball team , @entity116			0
strong challenge : vocal crowds wearing thick coats and scarves , some covering their faces with balaclavas , joined the giant rally public unrest : a masked demonstrator carries a poster which reads , ' @entity128 , please ! ' as he join the ranks of disillusioned citizens solidarity : several thousand demonstrators turned out in @entity72 , some wearing paper bags over their heads to disguise their identities statement : leftists carry red flags while marching to take part in the anti-putin @entity4 rally he joined today 's protest but did not take the stage			1
none of the contenders is expected to pose any serious challenge to mr @entity7 , whose ratings are now hovering just below the 50 per cent needed for a first - round victory			0
if he fails to win an outright victory , he would face a run - off three weeks later , most likely against @entity152 chief @entity151 , a rival he could easily defeat			0
protesters at today 's rally denounced the race as illegitimate , pointing to the tight controls mr @entity7 has imposed over the political scene that have destroyed all genuine political competition .			0

demonstrators took to streets of @entity72 and other @entity2 cities
*pro-putin* rally held at same time drew smaller crowd - most of them public *sector* workers brought in buses
