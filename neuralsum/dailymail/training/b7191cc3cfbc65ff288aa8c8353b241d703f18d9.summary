although he was very premature , he got through the critical first few weeks and was doing well in the hospital 's neo-natal intensive care unit			1
@entity10 , who was born 14 weeks early , pictured on a life support system in hospital			1
his parents allege he was taken off a ventilator without their permission while at @entity21 's hospital the tiny baby had to have a heart operation and so was moved to the hospital - which is in the same trust as the scandal hit @entity20 however , a heart duct which usually closes at birth remained open			1
doctors said he needed to go to @entity31 , which has a specialist children 's heart surgery centre , for an operation			1
five weeks after birth he was transferred to @entity36 - which is in the same trust as @entity20			1
as he was so premature , he needed a ventilator to help fill his lungs with oxygen			1
@entity10 's parents allege a nurse practitioner looking after their son - who had no authority to withdraw the life - supporting device - turned off the ventilator			1
after being taken off the ventilator @entity10 developed necrotising enterocolitis - or @entity51			1
this potentially fatal condition is common in premature babies , especially those with the heart problems			1
@entity10 had a series of cardiac arrests and tragically died the following day			1
after the child was taken off the ventilator , the boy suffered two cardiac arrests and tragically died parents @entity62 and @entity64 ( pictured ) now await the results of an inquest into the circumstances surrounding their son 's death it is understood the nurse who took @entity10 off his ventilator received further training following her action - but remains working at the hospital			1
she has not been disciplined or reported to the @entity78 which has the power to hold a hearing and remove her from the nursing register , it is thought			0
a @entity31 inquest will hear on monday the circumstances that led to @entity10 's death			1
the hospital where he died is part of the same trust as @entity91 - where the deaths of child heart surgery patients are to be the subject of an independent review , @entity87 medical director , sir @entity86 , said last week			1
this week the case of @entity97 , four months , who died of a cardiac arrest shortly after she was discharged from the hospital emerged			2
it is alleged she also received poor care from @entity102			0
@entity10 's parents @entity62 and @entity64 , who live in @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , returned from a rest break to find their son had been taken off the device			2
they said : ' we have no idea why the nurse did what she did - but we are convinced it cost our son his life			2
' nurses can only take a baby off a ventilator under a doctor 's direction and we know there was n't a doctor 's decision to do this			2
' before he could be put back on the machine he suffered a cardiac arrest			0
@entity10 was resuscitated by intensive care medics - but suffered a second heart attack the next day and lost his fight for life			1
@entity10 's coffin - which was made by his dad using wood intended to make his first cot the @entity138 - which is part of the same trust as @entity21 's where @entity10 died ms @entity64 said : ' our little boy was doing so well			1
we are still trying to understand why this nurse did what she did			0
what she did is inexcusable			0
' the doctors said he was n't ready to come of the ventilator and he was going to stay on it until he had his operation			0
' ' @entity154 was very premature at 25 weeks , but his lungs were holding up well			2
' he needed a relatively safe operation to close a heart duct that should normally shut at birth			2
that would have helped his breathing improve			0
' when we arrived at @entity21 's his life was n't in danger even though he was in intensive care			0
' we were told his prospects of coming off the ventilator were good following the heart surgery			1
' we have no idea why the nurse did what she did - but we are convinced it cost our son his life			2
' nurses can only take a baby off a ventilator under a doctor 's direction and we know there was n't a doctor 's decision to do this			0
' parents @entity184 and @entity186 - whose daughter @entity187 died after being discharged from the hospital the child 's parents also accuse @entity102 of delivering poor care and not doing proper medical checks when she was in cardiac arrest after being taken off the ventilator @entity10 developed @entity51			1
the couple believe the lack off oxygen when he was taken off the ventilator triggered the condition			0
ms @entity64 , 34 , who works as a vet , alleges @entity10 was left in ' agonising pain ' from the condition until doctors finally gave him pain relief in his final hours			2
she said : ' the end was terrible			0
his gut burst , he had peritonitis and blood poisoning and his heart just could n't cope			0
mr @entity10 , a 37 - year - old blacksmith , said : ' we have had no explanation for this nurse 's actions			1
' the doctors had agreed that he should stay on ventilation right up until he had his surgery			0
they did n't want to alter anything as he was doing so well			0
' @entity10 was the couple 's only child and is buried in his mother 's native @entity219			2
she said : ' our little boy 's coffin was made in the shape of a boat			0
it was handmade by @entity62 using the wood he had bought to build him his first cot			0
the reason it is a rowing boat is because we nick named him @entity231 and used to sing @entity232 , row , row your boat to him everyday			0
' the family 's @entity236 , of @entity238 in @entity239 , said : ' there is likely to be legal action action over @entity10 's death following his inquest			2
' @entity244 , chief executive of @entity245 said : ' we would like to offer our sincere condolences to the @entity10 family for the loss of their son , @entity10			2

another case was that of four - month - old @entity268 - one of several children to die following surgery at @entity20			1
she suffered cardiac arrest after being discharged from the facility			0
it is now alleged the child received poor treatment at the hands of the @entity102 - one of the largest in the country			0
