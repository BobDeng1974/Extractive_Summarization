mr @entity1 reportedly asked questions to staff about the cleanliness of the hospital and said that hospitals in general should be ' neat and splendid ' , while touring with a cigarette in hand in an emergency meeting of his top defence and security officials on saturday , @entity1 issued a series of orders that included the conclusion of preparations for a new nuclear test , the @entity34 reported			1
