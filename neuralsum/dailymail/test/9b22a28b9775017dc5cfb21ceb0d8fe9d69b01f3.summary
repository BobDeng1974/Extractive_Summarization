@entity1 motorsport boss @entity0 sees no reason to go cap in hand to the powers that be within the @entity7 giant and demand extra revenue to fight off the new threat of @entity10			1
from out of the blue , it was the scarlet red of @entity10 that was back on the top step of the podium for the first time in almost two years last time out in @entity17 , pushing reigning champion @entity18 and team - mate @entity19 down to second and third			1
from the threat of another @entity23 - dominated campaign in the wake of last year 's stunning success and crushing start to the season in @entity28 , @entity29 was provided with a much - needed tonic with @entity10 's return to winning ways courtesy of @entity33			1
@entity33 saw off the challenge from @entity1 drivers @entity18 and @entity19 in @entity17 @entity33 ( right ) won the second race of the season following @entity1 ' dominance last year that led to speculation @entity0 was prepared to ask for more funds from the @entity1 board to ensure his team stayed ahead of the pack			1
but a dismissive @entity0 said : ' we have everything we need			1
' we feel confident in the resources we have , the staff we have , and that we are well - placed			0
' we just need to stay calm , continue to develop and put the right things on the car			2
' maybe we put some things earlier on the car than planned , but there is no reason to panic			0
' we are back into a regular racing season where you have more than just one contender , and more than one - twos every single weekend			0
it 's back to normal business			0
' @entity1 chief @entity0 claims the champions will just keep calm and carry on mercedes will look into reasons why the team was beaten into second and third in @entity17 @entity0 insists his team has left no stone unturned since the race in @entity17 in a bid to uncover what went wrong , even though most teams would jump through hoops for a two - three finish			1
' although we had two cars on the podium , we have been looking very carefully at every area where we could have performed better , ' said @entity0			1
' our opposition has raised its game and we must now raise ours even further			0
' as we have said since @entity78 , we expect a season - long battle for both world championships and we must maximise every opportunity			0
@entity19 ( left ) and @entity18 visited @entity1 ' @entity83 base to go through their cars on thursday ' @entity85 is the next chance to do that - a circuit which has been a good hunting ground for the team			1
' @entity18 has a great record here , and for @entity19 it 's where he made his first step into the winners ' circle			1
' we have the weapons at our disposal and we need to make the most of them this weekend			0
' @entity18 is a three - time winner at the @entity98 - including last year - whilst he has been on the podium on three other occasions			2
@entity19 , meanwhile , was second to @entity18 last year after triumphing in 2012			2
like @entity0 , @entity18 knows more can and will be done , as he said : ' @entity17 was a tough weekend			1
@entity18 heads to @entity98 having won the @entity102 last year on his way to the title ' it always is with the heat , but with car problems on friday , rain during qualifying on saturday and a race which did n't go to plan on sunday , that one was particularly challenging			1
' ultimately we made the best choices we could , but there is always room for improvement and we 've been working hard to analyse everything for the next race in @entity85			0
' the circuit is one i really enjoy and it suits my driving style quite well			0
' i won the race last year and have only finished outside of the podium places twice , so the target is definitely to build on that and get back to the front			0
' the @entity129 driver is congratulated by film star @entity130 after winning the @entity28 @entity102 from his perspective , @entity19 is far from happy with his two races to date which have seen him finish second and third			2
' it 's not been a perfect start to my sixth year with the team and i 'm determined to turn that around this weekend , ' insisted @entity19			0
' of course , my team - mate will have other ideas , so will my compatriot in the red car ( @entity33 ) i 'm sure			2
' but this is a track that has always suited me well , so i 'm aiming to put in a strong weekend			0
