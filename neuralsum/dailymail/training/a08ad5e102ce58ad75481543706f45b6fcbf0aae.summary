by @entity0 published : 18:55 est , 27 july 2013 updated : 18:55 est , 27 july 2013 it is the provocative question posed by a @entity3 grandee which has delighted political gossips : is @entity5 the modern @entity6 ? the @entity8 prime minister was a bed - hopping chancer who deployed his flamboyant wit to charm his way out of trouble and exert a hypnotic hold over the @entity3			1
now @entity15 mayor mr @entity5 has fuelled the debate – by ruggedly defending the flawed leader			0
cut from the same cloth : @entity15 mayor @entity5 , right , and the flamboyant @entity20 leader @entity6 his remarks come in a review of the book that first drew the comparison between him and @entity6			1
in his article mr @entity5 brushes aside the statesman ’s personal failings , insisting they do nothing to diminish his ‘ phenomenal ’ achievements			0
the book – a biography of @entity6 by former foreign secretary @entity34 – argues that , like @entity5 , @entity6 ’s greatness derived more from character than achievement			1
mr @entity5 ’s rollicking and knowing review , for today ’s @entity39 , prompted @entity34 to claim vindication last night			2
mr @entity5 writes in his article : ‘ @entity6 is one of the greatest prime ministers this country has ever had , ’ before recounting with relish the book ’s warts - and - all portrayal of the pm			1
‘ he was an unprincipled adventurer of dubious sexual tastes ... he embezzled money from the husband of his mistress , engaged in at least one @entity51 , had a thing for one smooth - looking young man and seduced a series of older women , persuading one to give him huge sums of money by writing the bemused old trout a stream of oily letters			0
’ but the mayor insists that the critique of @entity6 ’s behaviour in @entity34 ’s ‘ superb and hilarious ’ book ‘ fails to make any kind of dent in his greatness ’			2
‘ his achievements were not slight , as the authors claim ; they were phenomenal , ’ says mr @entity5 , arguing that a politician ’s character flaws should not be allowed to influence the verdict of posterity			0
‘ he was the son of an antiquarian bookseller who overcame entrenched anti-semitism not by concealing his origins – but by foppishly and flamboyantly playing them up			0
’ @entity34 said that @entity5 's robust defence of @entity6 proves he was right all along in the most telling section of his review , mr @entity5 says : ‘ if he had a flaw it was that he was too amused			1
to the very end , he made jokes			0
asked as he lay dying whether he wanted the @entity81 to come and see him , he drawled that she would only want him to send a message to @entity92			0
’ he concludes : ‘ i do n’t know if it was the exact intention of the authors , but i ended the book reverencing @entity6 even more than when i began it			2
’ in the book @entity6 : or the two lives , which @entity34 co-wrote with @entity100 , the peer observes : ‘ according to accepted wisdom on modern politics , @entity5 should have been ruined years ago ... and yet his reputation has soared			1
’ last night lord @entity34 said that @entity5 ’s robust defence of @entity6 proves he had been right all along			2
‘ i am delighted that @entity5 enjoyed our book , but i notice that he does n’t actually contest a key point , namely that @entity6 was a brilliant , witty and remarkable politician driven by an overactive imagination and an overpowering love of fame , ’ said @entity34			1
‘ when we started the book , i thought @entity5 was a bit like @entity6			1
having learned about his review , i am convinced that they are indeed cut from the same cloth			0
