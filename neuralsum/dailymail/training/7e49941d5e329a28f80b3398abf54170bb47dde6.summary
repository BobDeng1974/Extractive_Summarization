young students at an elite private school have been terrorised by older boys who woke them in the middle of the night and dragged them from their dorm rooms as part of a traumatic hazing ritual			1
the principal of @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , said he was going to look ' deeply ' into the incident which saw students walked through the grounds of the school with pillow cases over their heads in the early hours of the morning			1
the scarring ceremony was carried out by six year 12 students , who marched the students around one of the boarding houses at 3.30am last thursday , @entity17 reported			1
during the ordeal a ' prank ' was apparently played , where the older boys hit themselves while another student yelled out - designed to scare the younger students into thinking some of their peers were being tortured			2
@entity29 , principal of @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity28 is looking into a cruel hazing incident which happened last week another student - in year 13 - is said to have hit one of the younger boys on the back of the legs during the horrible event			1
