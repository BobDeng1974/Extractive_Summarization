@entity9 the @entity8 was rescued by owner @entity10 in 1993 , when she was two years old , from a rehoming centre			1
but twenty years on , she 's still going strong			0
@entity9 was once the runt of the litter			2
now she is believed to be the @entity6 's oldest living dog @entity9 the @entity8 is celebrating her 22nd birthday - the equivalent of turning 100 after experts said different breeds age at different rates experts calculate that the terrier 's big day is the equivalent of turning 100 in human years - after scrapping the claim that one dog year equals seven human years , because different breeds age at a different rate			1
and mr @entity10 , from @entity26 , @entity27 , puts @entity9 's longevity down to her long walks in the countryside - and her refusal to eat dog food			1
he said : ' @entity9 has never had a tin of dog food in her life , she eats exactly what we eat			1
' her favourite meal is roast chicken and mashed potatoes , but she 'll happily eat anything			1
' she 's partial to a takeaway @entity42 , and she loves a homemade chilli too , as long as it 's not too spicy			0
' i would n't dream of giving her scraps - i cook an extra portion of food just for her , and she eats before the rest of the family			0
' she 's definitely a very pampered pooch , but she deserves it			2
she 's given us a lot of pleasure over the years			0
' mr @entity10 , 48 , adopted @entity9 from @entity56 for his niece , @entity57 , back in 1993 , after she had begged her family for a dog			1
animal shelter workers did n't have an exact date of birth for @entity9 - but believed her to be at least 24 months old when she was adopted			2
although the oldest dog ever known to have lived in the @entity6 reached the age of 26 , it is believed that @entity9 is the oldest living dog			1
when the family moved into a home that needed major renovations , @entity9 moved back in with mr @entity10 after she gaining a reputation as an escape artist			2
but strong - willed @entity9 decided she did n't want to move back after the renovations were finished and made it clear she 'd rather stay put			2

the @entity8 terrier has lived with the family for 20 years since being rescued life is a bit more sedate for @entity9 as she gets older , but she still enjoys playing with ice cubes and sleeping mr @entity10 said : ' when we rescued @entity9 , they told us she was the runt of the litter and would n't have been expected to survive long			1
' she was left to wander farmland as a stray before someone found her and took her to the shelter			0
' when we first adopted her , we had access to 40 acres of farmland , and @entity9 used to be off out into the fields first thing in the morning , and she 'd suddenly reappear just in time for her tea			2
' she has always hated going for walks on the lead , but give her a field to run around and she 's off			0
@entity9 enjoys playing with ice cubes and sleeping			0
mr @entity10 said : ' i used to have an ice machine , which was quite noisy , and she figured out how to knock it so the ice fell to the floor			0
' i give her one or two cubes as a treat now and then , and she loves them			0
' she spends most of the time sleeping now , but apart from being missing a few teeth and being a bit hard of hearing , she 's in really good health			0
' we do n't know the date of her real birthday , but we have always celebrated it on the day we adopted her , february 21			1
' we had a little party for her , and let her have a bit of cake - but the humans probably enjoyed it more than @entity9			0
' hopefully we 'll be celebrating many more birthdays to come			0
