the revelation comes as evidence piles up that the murderous regime of @entity10 was behind the suspected chemical weapons attack wednesday that killed an estimated 1,500 @entity6 in a @entity13 suburb			1
the preparation for a military strike could mean that president @entity16 intends to make good on his threat of ' enormous consequences ' if @entity10 crossed the ' red line ' of using chemical weapons against his own people			1
warning : graphic images ship - launched cruise missiles have a range of up to 1,500 miles - more than enough to reach @entity6 government targets dozens of children appear among the dead bodies piled up in @entity29 , @entity6			0

serious decisions : president @entity16 said that he will be taking action over the attack on wednesday where chemical weapons were used defiant : president @entity10 has denied that his government used chemical weapons and blamed the attack on rebel forces instead , @entity3 generals are hoping that such an attack could send a message to @entity10 - and also thwart future chemical weapons attacks			1
still , the president played down the likelihood of a unilateral attack on @entity6 government forces and seemed reticent to use military force			0
' if the @entity3 goes in and attacks another country without a @entity88 mandate and without clear evidence that can be presented , then there are questions in terms of whether international law supports it - " do we have the coalition to make it work ?
