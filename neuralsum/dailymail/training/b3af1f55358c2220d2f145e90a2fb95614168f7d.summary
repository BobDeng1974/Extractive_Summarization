@entity0 , @entity2 ’s chief of staff , sidles into the room with his gaze fixed to the floor – or , rather , to the hand - woven @entity7 carpet ( a personal gift to @entity9 from the president of @entity11 )			1
the place : no 10 @entity13			1
the date : november 20 , 2014 , the day of the @entity17 and @entity18 by - election			1
the polls will close in under two hours			1
‘ i ’m afraid it ’s bad news , prime minister , ’ he mutters			1
‘ i ’ve spoken to @entity23 [ @entity24 , the @entity25 ’ by - election head ]			1
we ’re going to ... ’ he pauses for a moment , and avoids the ‘ l ’ word			1
‘ we ’re not going to be successful			1
’ @entity2 casts his eyes upwards , as if in hope of divine intervention			1
finding none , he turns to the next best thing			1
‘ @entity35 , ’ he says , grimly			2
’ the chancellor glances up			2
he is one of three others in the room , together with @entity40 , the prime minister ’s campaigning chief and general svengali , and @entity44 , the chief whip			2
‘ we say we are listening to what the @entity56 people have to tell us			2
’ ‘ in other words , business as usual , ’ @entity40 interjects			1
‘ option two , ’ @entity60 continues			2
‘ make the big speech on @entity63			2
tough action after the next election			1
’ ‘ option three , ’ @entity44 cuts in			2
take the wind from @entity72 ’s sails			2
put @entity73 on the spot			1
@entity75 not to back us			2
if he wo n’t , force an election			2
’ @entity2 groans and glances at the office tv			1
as if to mock his agony , the live feed cuts to an image of horror : a chortling @entity72 , pint in hand outside @entity86 , bopping with @entity87 to the @entity88			2
then it cuts back to @entity90 for @entity91 , @entity2 ’s old rival			1
‘ a no - confidence vote in the prime minister ? ’ he says			2
‘ i could n’t possibly comment ... ’ now , i concede that the @entity49 leader is unlikely to be caught grooving to an allegedly racist song , for which he has apologised – let alone with @entity98 , a former @entity99 mp and @entity49 ’s by - election candidate ( though , @entity72 being @entity72 , you never know )			1
but this scenario is more likely to happen than not			2
the by - election will take place in less than a month			2
the polls show @entity49 in front			1
the prime minister has two options for the next election , stick to his campaign plan , which is to fight the contest on the economic recovery , strong leadership and future tax cuts , or put controlling @entity56 ’s borders at the heart of the election message that may change , of course			2
there could be a swing back to the devil – the conservatives			0
reckless may run into trouble			0
the @entity99 campaign machine , which is in fine shape , could win through			0
but the odds are against it			0
as matters stand , @entity72 ’s party is set to triumph – in which case , welcome to the @entity132			0
three main questions would follow the return of a triumphant reckless to @entity90 – and the consequent turmoil in the @entity99 ranks			0
which of those options would @entity2 take ? could any hold the party together ? would any be enough to stave off defections to @entity49 – and , worst of all , a vote of no - confidence in him ? the prime minister has a choice for the next election			1
the first is to stick to his campaign plan , which is to fight the contest on the economic recovery , strong leadership , future tax cuts and @entity73 ’s dire personal ratings – all woven together by @entity40 under the heading of ‘ security ’			1
tougher immigration control is part of the goods on offer , but it is n’t at the front of the shop window			0
the second is to put controlling @entity56 ’s borders at the heart of the @entity168 message			0
soft and hard versions have been floated , as shown			0
the soft one would promise action after the election – an emergency brake on @entity174 migration , perhaps , as a ‘ red line ’ in the renegotiation that @entity2 has pledged as part of a second term			1
the hard version is that words are no longer enough , and that only action will be taken seriously by the voters			1
it is difficult to see how closing the borders to @entity174 migrants could be either legal or practicable , or both			0
the free movement of people is part of the foundation of the @entity174			0
to bulldoze it would be tantamount to leaving the @entity174 unilaterally , which is why this option is almost certainly one the prime minister wo n’t take			0
he has another danger to shut down			0
@entity56 recently opted out of the @entity196 – the controversial arrangement that empowers @entity174 member states to arrest suspects more easily			0
@entity2 's best chance lies in the weakness of @entity73 - and that conservative mps , recognising this , will stick with him in the hope that most of them will win next may , and that the @entity206 will return to @entity90 as the largest single party			1
having taken @entity56 out , @entity208 wants to take it back in again			0
but the government faces a revolt from up to 100 conservative mps			0
@entity2 could take up alternatives floated by campaigning @entity99 backbenchers , such as the independent - minded @entity214 , to negotiate an agreement with other @entity174 countries that would keep @entity56 courts out of the jurisdiction of the @entity219			1
but he is in an exposed position on these manoeuvres : damned if he acts , damned if he does n’t			0
the @entity174 ’s new cash grab – its demand for an extra £ 1.7 billion – has come at the worst possible time			0
it puts more pressure on @entity2 to tear up the campaign grid and go for broke on halting @entity174 migration			1
that would be strongly welcomed by some @entity229 , but just as strongly opposed by others			0
@entity231 won support after saying , during a recent meeting of @entity229 , that the leadership had to get back to fighting the election on ground that is its own ( economic recovery ) rather than that which is @entity72 ’s ( stopping immigration )			0
the row will go on			0
this will be so even if no more @entity99 mps defect to @entity49 , and there is no challenge to @entity2 ’s leadership			1
a no - confidence vote is unlikely , even if @entity72 wins @entity17			0
some of the prime minister ’s conservative opponents recognise that a challenge could wreck the party altogether			0
others want him to take the blame for defeat			0
nonetheless , his position among @entity99 mps has never been strong			0
he failed to gain a majority of their votes in the leadership election that he won			0
he did n’t win the last election			0
and he looks most unlikely to pull off the next one			0
the distribution of the vote is stacked against the conservatives			0
@entity267 has gained former @entity269 voters			1
@entity49 is disproportionately winning former @entity99 ones			1
@entity2 ’s best chance lies in the dire weakness of @entity73 – and that conservative mps , recognising this , will stick with him in the hope that most of them will win next may , and that the @entity206 will return to @entity90 as the largest single party			1
it is still likely that they will			0
but not for nothing have @entity99 mps been called ‘ the most sophisticated electorate in the world ’			0
or , in other words , the most unpredictable – and hard to read			1
after @entity17 , the apocalypse may yet come knocking on @entity2 ’s door .			1

@entity2 's best chance lies in the weakness of @entity73
words are no longer enough , only action will be taken seriously by voters
if @entity49 triumphs it will be a @entity295
