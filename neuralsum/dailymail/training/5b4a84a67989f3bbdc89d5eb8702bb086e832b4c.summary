awkwardness : author @entity0 has suggested that the @entity1 are unsure how to greet each other @entity1 is the only country where people are unsure of how to greet each other , according to an expert - and the only remedy is to revive an old - fashioned phrase			1
social anthropologist @entity0 claims that the demise of the greeting ' how do you do ? ' has created awkwardness as @entity1 people no longer know how to say hello to each other			1
however , she points out that conversations about the weather often fulfil the function of forming social bonds - in the same way as apes groom each other			2
and she also suggests that the rise of social media has enabled the @entity1 to overcome their habitual reticence and open up to strangers			1
ms @entity0 's best - selling book , watching the @entity1 , which chronicles the habits and foibles of her fellow countrymen , was reissued this year to take account of how the country has changed in the decade since it was first published			1
speaking at the @entity34 on friday , she said that one of the biggest obstacles to more openness among the @entity1 was the difficulty of knowing what to say when you first meet someone , according to the @entity42			1
' i know people think that " how do you do ? " is an archaic , stuffy , sort of upper classy - type thing to say , ' she said			0
' but we really should be mounting a campaign for its revival because since " how do you do ? " declined as a standard greeting we have n't known what to say			0
' we do n't know what to do with our hands , we do n't know whether to kiss once or twice			0
every single other nation on the planet has a straightforward ritual for greeting someone			0
we seem to be the only ones who ca n't reach a consensus on what 's appropriate			0
' at the talk , ms @entity0 also compared the @entity1 habit of talking about the weather to chimpanzees picking fleas off each other - because both are largely meaningless rituals which contribute to ' social bonding '			1
she added : ' when you say , " oh gosh is n't it cold " , you 're not asking for a meteorological report			0
it 's a way of saying hello , or " i 'd like to talk to you " , without having to say anything quite so direct			0
' @entity78 : ms @entity0 , a social anthropologist , is a seasoned observer of @entity1 habits and foibles the updated edition of watching the @entity1 chronicles the changes in the @entity1 national character since the book originally came out in 2004			1
and the biggest change of all , according to ms @entity0 , is the way the internet and social media allow people to connect without the awkwardness of face - to - face interaction			2
she told the @entity93 audience that social networking facilitated the exchange of even the most intimate information - but the ubiquitous smartphone allows people to avoid others ' glances in public			0
ms @entity0 's analysis of @entity1 culture has previously highlighted how minute class distinctions can be determined by how we speak - for example , the upper - middle - class habit of saying ' sofa ' instead of ' settee ' .			2

social anthropologist @entity0 says the @entity1 are the only nation who are unsure how to greet each other
she suggests that people should start saying ' how do you do ? ' again
author tells the @entity34 that talking about the weather is a form of social bonding similar to apes grooming
