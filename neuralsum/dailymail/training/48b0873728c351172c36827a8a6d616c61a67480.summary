by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 05:58 est , 29 january 2013 updated : 04:05 est , 30 january 2013 @entity2 looks set for another row over pay for its casino banking staff following a year of shame for the company			1
the bank , which is more than 80 per cent owned by the taxpayer , is under pressure to claw back £ 4m in shares owed to @entity12 , the head of the investment bank			1
it is also thought that @entity2 is planning to pay bonuses worth £ 250m – an average of £ 21,000 for each of its 11,900 staff in the division , although so - called high - flyers will get far more			1
that would be well down on the £ 390m it paid out for 2011 and £ 937m in 2010 but will still raise eyebrows in the wake of a series of scandals to hit the bank			2
@entity2 ( down 22p at 345.8p ) is likely to be hit with a fine worth around £ 500m over its involvement in the libor rate - rigging scandal – possibly as early as this week			1
the share price fell yesterday after reports that criminal charges could be brought against the bank			0
it is also facing a rising bill for its part in the mis - selling of payment protection insurance having already set aside £ 1.7bn			0
and it has coughed up £ 175m following a computer meltdown last summer which caused havoc for millions of customers at its @entity46 , @entity2 and @entity47 branches			2
former business secretary @entity48 said today that bankers should pay all of the @entity51 fine			0
threatened : @entity2 is likely to be hit with a fine worth around £ 500m over its involvement in the libor rate - rigging scandal - possibly as early as this week ‘ there would be enormous anger if taxpayers had to foot the bill for the sins of @entity2 , ’ he said			1
‘ if they are fined they should take it out of the bonus pool rather than the bank ’s general resources			0
’ unite chief @entity66 added : ‘ it looks like ordinary bank workers and taxpayers will pay the price for the greed at the top of @entity2			2
it is time ( chancellor ) @entity76 put his foot down			0
’ sacrifice : ceo @entity79 has waived his bonus for three of the past four years @entity2 chief executive @entity79 agreed to waive his bonus for 2012 in the wake of the it glitch			0
he could have got £ 2.4m on top of his £ 1.2m salary but has now waived his bonus in three of the past four years since taking over at the bank after its £ 45bn bailout by the taxpayer			0
but @entity90 officials are now pressuring @entity2 to claw back a deferred share package worth £ 4m owed to @entity92			1
he is expected to leave the company shortly as part of a restructuring of the investment banking arm			1
but his departure could also be part of an attempt to draw a line under the libor scandal – even though the settlement with @entity104 and @entity105 regulators is not likely to implicate any senior figures			0
sources close to the bank said the @entity2 case was ‘ not the same situation as at @entity111 ’ where disgraced chief executive @entity112 was forced to stand down			2
they also insisted the £ 4m owed to @entity92 is not a ‘ payout ’ but instead shares he has already earned since he joined the bank in 2009			1
an @entity2 source also said that no decision has been made on bonus payments as yet - but a £ 250m pot would represent another fall and is well below what rivals earn at other banks			1
shadow chancellor @entity125 wrote in the @entity126 today : ‘ there should be fair rewards for performance			0
but these bonuses are bound to cause concern after the interest rate fixing scandals			0
