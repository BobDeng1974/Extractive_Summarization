the @entity8 president blamed @entity9 for economic problems in his country and warned that immediate action is required to solve the eurozone crisis			1
but in an intervention that will alarm the @entity14 , mr @entity1 declared that cuts are preventing economic growth which could prompt an upturn			2
under fire : @entity1 has launched an outspoken attack on austerity measures such as those introduced by @entity23 his remarks are a sideswipe at those , like @entity23 , who have urged austerity measures			2
‘ even as @entity9 countries with large debt burdens carry out necessary fiscal reforms , they ’ve also got to promote economic growth and job creation , ’ said the president			1
‘ as some countries have discovered , it ’s a lot harder to rein in deficits and debt if your economy is not growing			0
’ @entity41 plunged into a double - dip recession this year and the chancellor @entity43 has admitted that cuts will continue for two years after the 2015 general election			1
but the @entity14 insists that the @entity46 will stick to its plans or risk the cost of government debt rising , which would send mortgage rates soaring			0
president @entity1 delivered his hard - hitting attack , warning austerity is ‘ a problem ’ when countries ‘ resort to a strategy of “ let ’s cut more ” ’			1
this leads to ‘ government lay - offs and reductions in spending ’ at a time ‘ when an economy is still weak and a recovery is still fragile ’			2
he added : ‘ if you ’re doing all those things at the same time as consumers are pulling back and there is generally weak demand then you get on a downward spiral where everybody is pulling back			0
‘ that weakens demand and it further crimps the desire of companies to hire more people			0
and that ’s the pattern that @entity9 is in danger of getting into			0
’ mr @entity1 said it was ‘ a positive thing ’ that debate in @entity9 has turned towards growth			1
praised : mr @entity1 singled out @entity80 chancellor @entity79 and @entity82 president @entity81 for ' worknig to put in place a growth agenda he singled out @entity80 chancellor @entity79 and new @entity82 president @entity81 for ‘ working to put in place a growth agenda alongside responsible fiscal plans ’			1
no such praise , however , was offered to mr @entity23			0
amid signs that mr @entity1 fears the @entity9 economic downturn could cost him re-election in november , he said it ‘ matters to us , because @entity9 is our largest economic trading partner ’			1
labelled ' delusional ' : @entity98 prime minister @entity97 claims @entity41 will still one day join the eurozone despite its current economic woes he added : ‘ if there ’s less demand for our products in places like @entity107 or @entity108 , it could mean less business in places like @entity111 and @entity112			1
’ mr @entity1 called for ‘ specific steps ’ that @entity9 leaders ‘ can take right now to prevent the situation from getting worse ’ including injecting capital into weak banks			1
the president spoke out as sources revealed that @entity120 is expected to ask today for a new eurozone bailout			0
a crisis meeting in @entity123 is expected to thrash out the terms of a deal which will pump £ 80billion into ailing @entity120 banks			0
the agreement is expected to see funds handed out from the eurozone bailout fund , meaning @entity41 taxpayers do not have to contribute			2
it is likely to be finally signed off on june 21 , when auditors report on the state of @entity120 bank finances			0
‘ it is more a question of how , not whether there will be a bailout , ’ said one @entity123 source			0
yesterday , the head of @entity142 ’s second largest bank warned that his country will also need a bailout to prop up institutions badly exposed to @entity147 debt			0
