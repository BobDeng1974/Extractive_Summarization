texting while crossing the road was the riskiest activity , making people four times more likely to ignore oncoming traffic and disobey the lights , according to a new study			1
texters also took longer to cross the street at busy junctions			0
almost one in three pedestrians were using phones or doing something else distracting at the same time as they were trying to cross the road			1
danger : the @entity22 study found that those texting while crossing the road are four times more likely to ignore oncoming traffic the findings come from a ‘ real - time ’ study of more than 1,000 pedestrians who were watched at busy road junctions , in the @entity31 city of @entity32			1
study leader dr @entity33 , of @entity34 , @entity22 , said , like drink driving , there should be a ‘ low tolerance ’ approach to pedestrian behaviour that puts both them and others at risk of serious injury			1
she said ‘ some years ago no one would think twice about having a couple of drinks before getting in the car to drive home			0
‘ but today people know the risks and we have to get that same level of awareness in an era of growing distraction			2
‘ we may need advertising campaigns to get the message home ’ she added			0
there is increasing concern about the near trance - like state people adopt while using mobile phones and mp3 players , which psychologists call ‘ divided attention ’ or ‘ inattentional blindness ’			1
it has become the focus for safety campaigners worried about safety on the roads and pavements , with some research suggesting serious accidents involving people wearing headphones while walking in the street have tripled			2
in the latest study 1,100 people were observed crossing 20 busy road junctions this summer at different times of the day , including the morning rush hour			1
the observers recorded ‘ distracting ’ activities , such as talking on the phone , text messaging , or listening to music on mobile devices , as well as talking to others or dealing with children or pets			2
just under 30 per cent of pedestrians were doing something else when they crossed the road , says a report in the journal @entity98 ( must credit )			2
one in 10 were listening to music , seven per cent were texting ; and six per cent were talking on the phone			2
those who were distracted took significantly longer to cross the road - 0.75 to1.29 seconds longer			2
while listening to music speeded up the time taken to cross the road , those doing it were less likely to look both ways before doing so			0
people distracted by pets or children were almost three times as likely not to look both ways			1
hazard : using a mobile phone while driving is already an illegal offence but the study warns that using a phone as a pedestrian can be just as hazardous but texting was potentially the most risky behaviour , as texters took almost two seconds ( 18 per cent ) longer to cross the average junction of three to four lanes than those who were n’t texting at the time			1
they were also almost four times more likely to ignore lights , to cross at the middle of the junction , or fail to look both ways before stepping off the kerb			1
dr @entity33 said ‘ texters were four times less likely to cross the road safely , by looking both ways and obeying the lights			1
they took a constellation of risks of the kind that put people at high risk of being seriously injured			0
’ she said young teenagers and young adults were the biggest culprits			0
‘ the observers were student researchers and they were taken aback by what they were seeing			0
it made them think , and i believe schools should conduct this kind of exercise to make children aware of the risks of being distracted ’ she said			0
advertising campaigns similar to those getting people to obey the law and wear seatbelts might work , she said			0
but people who use mobiles are prey to ‘ compulsive behaviour ’ which is not necessarily rational , she said			0
‘ they may feel they are safer than other people while texting - they are capable of doing it while crossing the road			1
‘ the trouble is when the phone rings they answer it wherever they are , and do n’t realise they need full concentration in a situation which is potentially dangerous ’ she added .			0

people are four times more likely to ignore traffic and disobey lights if texting
@entity22 study looked at 1,000 ' real - time ' pedestrians
one in three were using phones or doing something similarly distracting
