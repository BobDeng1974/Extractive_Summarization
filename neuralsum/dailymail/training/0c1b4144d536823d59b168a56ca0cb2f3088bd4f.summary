by @entity0 published : 10:54 est , 11 march 2014 updated : 18:50 est , 11 march 2014 plans to end criminal punishment for not paying the tv licence could cost the @entity6 £ 200million a year and lead to channels being axed , an executive said yesterday			1
strategy chief @entity8 warned that viewers must be threatened with jail or they would simply stop paying the £ 145.50 annual charge			1
he was hitting back at @entity12 plans to make evading the licence a civil matter , which means offenders would also avoid getting a criminal record			1
@entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 could all face the axe if plans to decriminalise tv licence evasion go ahead , the @entity21 has warned popular shows like @entity26 ' @entity25 ( left ) and @entity27 , presented by @entity28 on @entity18 , would be left without a home removing the threat of jail means fines for not paying the fee – currently set at a maximum of £ 1,000 – would be raised even higher , said mr @entity8 , a former @entity35			1
in 2012 , more than 180,000 people , or around 3,500 a week , faced the courts for not paying their licence fee , accounting for one in nine cases before magistrates			1
from january 2011 to march 2013 , some 107 people were sent to jail , the ultimate punishment for not paying the fine imposed for evading the licence			1
but the heavy - handed tactics of the @entity6 ’s army of collectors have sparked growing anger among viewers			2
the corporation was also criticised for turning its viewers into criminals by @entity56 mp @entity55 , he has tabled an amendment to change the law which has the backing of 100 - plus @entity60			2
@entity19 , which airs shows like @entity62 and @entity63 , has a budget of almost £ 80million ‘ it is diabolical that those who ca n’t afford to pay the licence fee are being turned into criminals , ’ he said			1
‘ these cases are clogging up the criminal justice system			2
‘ imagine if president @entity71 started charging a poll tax to fund a @entity74 state broadcaster and locked up people for not paying			2
‘ there would be an outcry			2
there is a growing feeling within @entity80 that things have to stop			2
this issue is not going to go away			0
’ @entity6 executive @entity8 said if licence fee evasion rose to 5 per cent , it would cost the @entity6 £ 200million last week , justice secretary @entity85 revealed proposals to make non-payment a civil matter , as with gas and electricity bills , and @entity92 subscriptions			1
but mr @entity8 , speaking at the launch of the new @entity94 , argued : ‘ say the rate of evasion was to double from about five per cent now , that would be £ 200million , that would be the equivalent of all of @entity18 , all of @entity17 , all of @entity19			1
‘ doing it very quickly would be a huge risk			0
the choice would mean either we take some services off [ air ] or the government would have to have a higher licence fee			0
’ he denied that the court system was being clogged up as licence fee cases were looked at ‘ in bulk ’			0
mr @entity8 claimed that under a civil punishment , magistrates would not be able to match the fine to the non-payer ’s income			1
‘ so there is actually a danger we go over to a system in which we have higher fines but with less success in collecting the licence fee , ’ added the @entity6 boss			0
mr @entity8 also dismissed the idea of a subscription system , saying it would cost roughly £ 500million to set up for 40million @entity127 sets and cost more than the licence fee system to run			1
last month , director general @entity129 said the @entity6 wanted to extend the licence fee to the @entity94 , meaning those who only watch catch - up tv online will have to pay just like viewers who own television sets			0
comedian @entity135 has been given a new show on the @entity6 ’s @entity94 website – putting him out of the reach of watchdogs			0
the @entity141 performer , 41 , has a long history of offending viewers but @entity143 will be powerless as it only has power to act over complaints about terrestrial tv			0
he will appear in @entity135 and @entity148 ’s @entity147 in may in which the two comedians satirise the popularity of tv cooking programmes			0
@entity135 was fired by @entity153 in 2012 for making sick jokes about competitors in the @entity156			1
his show is the latest in the @entity6 trend towards showing more content solely online where there is no watershed			0
this was criticised by @entity163 , director of @entity164 , who warned it would expose children to more adult material			0
the @entity6 said editorial rules will keep @entity135 in line .			0

making non-payment a civil matter could lead to a rise in evasion
if evasion rate doubles to 10 *%* @entity21 would face £ 200million *shortfall*
@entity17 costs £ *30million* , @entity19 £ 80million and @entity18 £ *50million*
