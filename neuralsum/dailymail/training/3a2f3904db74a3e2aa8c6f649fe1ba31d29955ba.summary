when @entity1 arrives at @entity2 's on saturday , he 'll be emotional			1
the former @entity4 hardman may even shed a tear , perhaps not something you would expect from a man of his reputation			0
how would you feel after running close to 1,000 miles in three weeks ? pretty emotional , probably			1
test : @entity1 ( left ) is running the 1000 miles between every @entity13 ground in just 21 days power : the former @entity4 full - back poses by the pitch after reaching @entity19 's @entity18 stadium well , when @entity1 reaches the final stop of his tour of all 20 @entity13 grounds ahead of @entity4 's clash against @entity25 this weekend , that 's exactly what he would have achieved			1
twenty - one days of agony , ice - baths and sleep deprivation - all in aid of @entity31			2
' i 've always been interested in extreme challenges such as this and the idea to do something like this has been floating around in my head for about three years now , ' @entity1 told @entity39			1
' and then came the moment where i just thought : " it 's now or never "			0
i always wanted a challenge to be based around football given i used to be professional , so this sounded like a perfect idea - though halfway through , i 'm not so sure now ! emotional : although the physical pain is tough , it 's the mental test that @entity1 is finding hardest ' the idea of seeing how far you can push yourself has always intrigued me			1
' @entity1 , now 45 , knows a thing or two about putting his body through the mill. over 300 league appearances for the @entity4 between 1988 and 2004 speaks for itself			1
but the former @entity4 full - back is quick to point out that his years as a @entity13 footballer pales in comparison to his current challenge of running , on average , 50 miles a day			1
helping out : @entity1 battles with @entity61 but his former teammate is helping him along the way ' obviously the pain threshold is the biggest difficulty you face , ' said @entity1			1
' it 's a different type of fitness to playing football professionally , this is more about the mind when you can barely put one foot in front of the other			0
' nothing can prepare you for that			0
the extent of my training was going on a 40 miler , but i had two days off after that			0
' so you know you can run the distance , it ' just having the mindset to tell yourself you have to do it everyday			0
that 's the hardest thing			0
' some days you get through it , some days you can hardly put one foot in front of each other			0
stretching the limits : running an average of 50 miles a day , some days @entity1 runs longer than he sleeps ' some days i finish running , take an ice bath , eat and fall straight into bed and have to do it all over again			1
some days i 'm running longer in a day than i 'm sleeping at night			1
' some days i just ca n't eat anything , i have no appetite			0
obviously my support team are keen for me to stay sufficiently refuelled for the next day , but some days i just ca n't physically eat anything			2
' that is perhaps the hardest thing			0
the running , yes , it 's painful but you get through it			2
' but it 's the mental and emotional battle that is the hardest to deal with			2
all the days are blurring into one at the moment			0
' the other day i just burst into tears when i finished for the day after seeing my family			2
you do n't expect that to happen			0
mental strength : ' it 's a different type of fitness to playing football professionally , ' says @entity1 ' you can prepare physically , but it 's the emotional side you ca n't prepare for			1
but that was part of the intrigue for me , how far you can push yourself , what your limits are			2
' thankfully , @entity1 has been helped along the way during his gruelling personal battle across @entity128 's footballing landscape			1
he 's managed to rope former team - mates @entity61 , @entity130 and @entity131 into helping him along on certain legs , while current top - flight stars @entity134 and @entity135 have also lent their support			1
@entity4 's promising start to the season will have also helped @entity1 's mood along the way			1
many had tipped the south - coast club as relegation contenders following the departure of manager @entity145 to @entity146 , as well as the likes of @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152			2
but under the guidance of new manager @entity154 , @entity4 have lost just one from their opening three game - a narrow defeat at @entity158			0
exhausted : by the time he arrives at @entity2 's on saturday @entity160 will have been to all 20 grounds @entity162 : the fullback had a reputation as a tough guy but he admits to breaking down during this journey staying positive : @entity1 believes that @entity154 's men can have a good season despite a tough summer ' people had @entity4 tagged as relegation candidates , but i was always pretty confident , i suppose i 'm always a confident and positive person , ' added @entity1 ' people were questioning why were selling so many players , in many ways we were victims of our own success			2
but @entity154 needed time to get his players in and he looks to have signed some real real quality there			0
' so i was never one who feared the worst			0
' you 'll need all that positive thinking this week , @entity1			2
