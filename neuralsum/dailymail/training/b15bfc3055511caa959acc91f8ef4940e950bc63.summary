jumper : @entity1 successfully made it into the @entity3 on september 19 due to a series of mistakes made by the @entity6 , according to a report given to @entity8 on thursday the man who jumped the @entity3 fence and made it all the way to the @entity13 in september did so because of a dozen @entity6 fumbles , including an officer on the @entity16 who was too busy talking on his phone to notice the breach			1
@entity1 made it past scores of officers when he jumped the fence the evening of september 19 and ran across the lawn , breaking into the @entity3 through the front door before finally being tackled by two officers clocking out of their shift			1
the military veteran was just one of five who have eluded security and made it on the lawn at 1600 @entity31 this year , leading to the disgraceful resignation of @entity6 director @entity33 in october			1
however , he was the only one to make it inside the @entity3			0
on thursday , @entity8 was briefed by the @entity35 on the errors that led to @entity1 's breach of security , and the @entity39 reported the findings after obtaining a summary of the findings not yet released to the public			2
@entity1 's history with the @entity6 goes all the way back to july 19 , two months before the day he broke into the @entity3 , when he was stopped in @entity46 and a search of his car uncovered 11 firearms , including an illegal shotgun and a map of @entity52 with the @entity3 highlighted			1
the @entity53 informed the @entity6 about the incident , but the office did not further investigate @entity1 at the time			2
an investigation was opened into @entity1 though when a report was filed by federal , state and local law enforcement officials in @entity46			0
put the phone down : the report showed that one officer stationed on the @entity16 with an attack dog did n't respond to the breach because he did n't have his ear piece in and was on a personal call			1
above , a map of @entity1 's route into the @entity3 dash : a video of the incident shows @entity1 running towards the @entity3 after getting past plainclothes security guards outside the fence			1
@entity74 teams and an attack dog failed to stop him on the lawn a month later , officers spotted @entity1 outside the @entity3 walking around with a hatchet tucked into his pants , but let him go because he was not breaking any laws			1
they reported his name however to headquarters and learned he was the subject of an investigation			0
a few minutes later , they went back to interview @entity1 and found ' several empty firearms cases , four hatches , several bottles of urine and camping gear ' in his car , but again could do nothing because he still was n't violating the law			2
a month later , the day of the breach , @entity1 was again spotted outside the @entity3 gate around 6pm , but officers did n't stop him because he was n't acting odd at the time			1
an hour later , @entity1 quickly jumped over the fence at a point in the gate where there was n't any ornamental spikes on the posts to slow him down			1
officers were then slow to respond to the intruder because of ' unintelligent traffic of the radio '			2
others had a hard time figuring out where the intruder was due to construction on the north grounds			0
one of the officers stationed on the @entity16 with an attack dog , did n't even hear the reports because he did n't have his ear piece on and was taking a personal call			1
he also did n't have his other radio on him , which was instead stored in his locker			0
disgrace : @entity1 is just one of five people who have made it past security at the @entity3 this year , leading @entity6 director @entity33 to resign in shame that officer only noticed @entity1 when he saw two officers running towards the intruder on the lawn			1
by that time it was too late to get the dog ' locked onto ' the target			0
those first two @entity6 officers pointed their guns at @entity1 , but the man continued past them towards the @entity135			1
they decided not to shoot because they believed he was unarmed			0
it was later revealed that he had a knife			0
from there , @entity1 went into the bushes near the portico , and the officers stopped following him because they believed the bushes were too thick to pass through			0
they ended up being wrong and @entity1 made it out on the other side , just feet from the front door			0
an officer stationed at the front door decided to hide behind a pillar with his weapon , to take @entity1 by surprise and because he thought the front door to the @entity3 was locked anyway			2
hearing : this courtroom artist rendering shows judge @entity153 , left , presiding during @entity3 fence jumper @entity154 's , center , case in court in @entity52 last month he pointed his gun at @entity1 when the man arrived on the front steps , but again @entity1 would not take orders and the officer decided not to shoot			1
surprisingly to that officer , the front door was indeed open and @entity1 made it into the @entity3 's @entity168 where a female officer tried to stop him			1
@entity1 knocked that officer down and then proceeded to the @entity13 , before turning back around			0
soon after , a pair of officers who just ended their shift tackled @entity1 and finally brought him into custody			0
no @entity6 officers or agents have been disciplined yet in connection to the breach			2
that will likely happen after the larger investigation is finished			0
after hearing the report on thursday , members of @entity8 expressed their disappointment in the agency in charge of insuring the president 's safety			2
' this report indicates that the @entity6 â€™s response at the @entity3 was significantly hampered on september 19th because of critical and major failures in communications , confusion about operational protocols , and gaps in staffing and training			2
while some of these problems can be attributed to a lack of resources , others are systemic and indicative of @entity6 culture , ' rep @entity197 , a @entity199 from @entity200 told the @entity207			0
' some of these problems have begun to be addressed , however it is imperative that @entity35 follows through on these findings and institutes real reforms			0

military veteran @entity1 jumped the @entity3 fence and made it into the president 's residence on september 19
he came into contact with several @entity6 agents on the lawn but none were able to stop him from running into the @entity3
one of the officers with an attack dog did n't respond to the breach because he did n't have his ear radio in and was taking a personal phone call
