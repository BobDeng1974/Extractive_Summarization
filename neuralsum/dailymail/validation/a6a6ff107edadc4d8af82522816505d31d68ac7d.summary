single thongs across @entity1 now have the chance to find a ' solemate '			2
at least that ’s what a new online service hopes to provide , and with a tagline of it ’s like @entity10 for @entity11 , the chance is now there for that single and lonely ‘ lefty ’ or ‘ righty ’ to find a new life partner			2
@entity18 man @entity17 is the brains behind the new venture that started off as a laugh on @entity22 , but has since become a huge fashion sensation			1
@entity18 's @entity17 wants single thongs to find the perfect partner @entity22 page is trying to get the right match for thongs who are now on their own thanks to mr @entity17 all you have to do is upload a photograph or write a description of the required thong onto his @entity22 page and wait for a match			1
when a proper match has been made they send it to you for a mailing fee of $ 7.50			0
' i was cleaning out my cupboard and i noticed i had a few single thongs			2
i did n't want to throw them out as they were in too good a nick , ' mr @entity17 told @entity48			1
' so i went on my @entity22 page and asked if anyone had any thongs that could match up with any of them			1
these single thongs were washed up on an @entity18 river bank			1
@entity22 is hoping to stop this and make a difference environmentally ' one of my mates got back to me with one which was the right size			1
i told my mates about this and they got on @entity22 asking me if i could find them one			1
it was then i thought that there maybe some legs in this idea			0
' he set up the @entity22 page 11 weeks ago and now has more than 1,100 followers			1
what started out as a bit of fun suddenly exploded into life and it soon became clear that the @entity22 page was n't the right platform for the endeavour			1
it soon became clear that there was a market for people looking for replacement thongs ' for this reason i have some it people in @entity83 working on a dedicated website that will make it really easy to look for a thong , ' he said			1
' it 'll be set up similarly to those ' classified ad ' style websites			0
the website is hopefully around six weeks away and will be called havymatch.com.au			2
' the 36 - year - old , who works as fitter and turner in @entity1 's copper mines , also realised that although he 'd started it all off as a bit of a lark there was a serious point to the idea of finding a match for your thong			0
the sight every holiday - maker hates to see on their return home - the dreaded single thong in the suitcase ' a friend was walking along beside a river near my house and he collected about 40 single thongs that had been washed up on the bank after heavy rain , ' he told @entity48			0
' his point was that if people are swapping thongs they would n't be throwing them away like this			0
it would make a big difference to the environment			0
' i realised that there was also a serious side to all this			0
and that it could make a difference environmentally			2
' rather than throwing them away , thongs of all shapes and sizes could still be of use it 's all the better too as his habit of wearing odd thongs was causing a few problems at home			0
' my wife gives me a lot of grief about it			0
i 've a righty that is red and white and a lefty that is black and blue , ' he said			0
now he can argue that although he may not win any style competitions , at least he 's being environmentally friendly			0
mr @entity17 believes that even wearing odd thongs is better than having just the one			1

@entity17 reckoned that there could be a market for replacement thongs
the @entity18 man set up @entity22 page to tackle the problem
in just 11 weeks the @entity22 page got more than 1,100 followers
it became so *popular* mr @entity17 is now working on a dedicated website
the new venture also hopes to make an *impact* environmentally
