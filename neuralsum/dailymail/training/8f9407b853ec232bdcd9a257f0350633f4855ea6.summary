@entity1 coach @entity0 has apologised for making disparaging comments about @entity4 players in football , although he still maintains they were misinterpreted against a backlash of widespread criticism			1
@entity0 , capped 58 times by @entity10 and a member of the team which lost the 2006 world cup final to @entity14 , gave a question and answer session on tuesday to readers of @entity19 's regional newspaper when the subject of @entity4 players was raised			1
he said : ' the advantage of what i would call the typical @entity4 player is that he is n't expensive when you sign him , ( he is ) a player who is ready for combat , but football is n't just about that			1
@entity0 explained his comments on @entity4 players in football at a press conference on thursday the @entity1 manager had pre-prepared notes to refer to during the press conference @entity36 - @entity35 @entity38 - @entity37 @entity39 - @entity35 @entity41 - @entity40 @entity42 - @entity37 @entity44 - @entity43 @entity46 - @entity45 @entity48 - @entity47 explaining himself , he continued : ' football is also ( about ) technique , intelligence			1
you need a bit of everything			0
you need @entity56 too , @entity56 are good			0
' speaking on thursday at a pre-match news conference ahead of saturday 's game with @entity59 , @entity0 tried to explain his comments			1
he added : ' if by my lack of clarity , or my imperfect semantics , i may have shocked , humiliated or hurt people then i am sorry			0
' the interpretation that these people may have made does not reflect my way of thinking in any way or my humanist convictions			0
' however , he said the comments made sense in a sporting context			2
' when i spoke about the @entity4 ( player ) who is cheaper and ready for combat , i simply meant to talk about the young @entity4 player arriving in @entity77 with all of his will to win and often to escape from a precarious situation , ' @entity0 continued as he read from pre-prepared notes			1
' then , since we were in a debate about football , the intelligence i spoke of was obviously related to tactical intelligence			2
@entity0 has been criticised for the comments he made regarding @entity4 players @entity59 manager @entity88 is among those unhappy with the comments @entity0 made ' the forming of young players in @entity4 , probably because of a lack of financial means , or ( lack ) of infrastructure , is n't always as complete as what 's available in @entity77			1
' @entity0 distanced himself from accusations that his viewpoint was offensive			2
' in no way did i mean to talk about an individual 's intelligence in the proper sense of the term			2
regarding certain accusations of racism , i 'm 37 ( and ) i 've spent 32 of them in a football dressing room			0
i 've never had a problem with anyone , ' the former @entity111 player said			0
but @entity59 coach @entity88 , who was born in @entity114 , is among those who felt offended by @entity0			1
' let 's make things clear : this is not a case of him being clumsy			0
he 's really messed up , ' @entity88 said			0
' what he said is serious			0
explaining that an @entity4 player is cheaper ... i felt humiliated and hurt			2
' the @entity125 ( @entity125 ) strongly condemned @entity0 , as did former @entity127 president @entity126 , who called for @entity4 players to boycott one round of @entity131 league games in protest			1
@entity1 coach @entity0 played alongside @entity134 during his time with the @entity10 national team @entity1 forward @entity39 said the whole squad appreciated @entity0 's apology @entity140 president @entity139 , who formerly employed @entity0 as coach of @entity10 's under - 21 side , defended him , while former teammate @entity134 - an active anti-racism campaigner - was more measured			1
' i played alongside @entity0 , he 's somebody i respect			1
i know him very well , ' @entity134 told @entity19			2
' i do n't think you should put @entity0 on trial , but you should put prejudice on trial			1
each one of us harbors some prejudice , which is why people working in football , who have a certain exposure to the media , should be educated on this subject			0
' @entity0 's captain at @entity1 is @entity35 international @entity157 , who called @entity0 's comments ' clumsy ' before defending him , as did club president @entity159			1
' he does n't have any twisted ideas			0
he believes in all the black players in the team , ' @entity36 told @entity131 radio			2
' we believe in him and we hope to go very far with him			0
' @entity1 forward @entity39 , who is black , told @entity167 radio that @entity0 apologised			1
' we all now pertinently well that the coach is not a racist , ' @entity39 said			0
' it 's true that , at first , we asked ourselves a few questions			0
but he explained how it happened			0
he apologised to the players			2
