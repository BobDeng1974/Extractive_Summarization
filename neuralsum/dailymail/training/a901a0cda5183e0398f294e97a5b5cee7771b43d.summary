when @entity1 lost her third baby in a row to miscarriage , she was heartbroken			1
she had low levels of a simple hormone which is prescribed to pregnant women in other countries – but not here			2
mrs @entity1 was desperate for a sibling for her baby son and vowed she would do everything possible to make it happen			1
after becoming pregnant for a fourth time , she decided on @entity15 treatment to give the baby every possible chance			0
@entity1 , 24 , was desperate for a sibling for her baby son , but miscarried each of the three times she became pregnant			1
after begging her gp to prescribe a progesterone gel , she managed to conceive again and finally gave birth to their daughter , @entity24 , now 11 months old mrs @entity1 said all the past miscarriages totally ruined her much wanted pregnancy			1
mrs @entity1 was delighted when she gave birth to her healthy baby girl , @entity24 , in november last year the 24 - year - old spent £ 100 on the hormone progesterone – enough to get her through the all - important first few months of pregnancy			1
her gp could not give it to her on the @entity34 – it is not officially approved for use in this way - but eventually agreed to prescribe it privately			2
it was a nailbiting time for @entity1 and husband @entity39 , 42 , an it consultant , but the birth of daughter @entity24 made it all worthwhile			1
mrs @entity1 , from @entity41 , @entity42 , said : ‘ all the past miscarriages totally ruined my much wanted pregnancy			1
i spent the whole time thinking i was going to lose her			0
‘ i thought i was going to wake up in labour and she would be dead			0
‘ a lot of women blame themselves for miscarriages but i think this is such a simple answer to help these people			2
’ the proud mother successfully conceived her son @entity54 , now three , in 2011 and never dreamed she would have problems completing her family			1
the couple decided to try for a second child and she became pregnant in october 2012			0
mrs @entity1 was told by doctors she had low progesterone but assured her the baby was healthy during her first scan			1
progesterone is a hormone which occurs naturally in the body			2
some women with certain types of fertility problems have low levels of progesterone and are unable to become pregnant or support a pregnancy in its early stages			2
progesterone gel is used in the treatment of infertility , sometimes along with other infertility treatment techniques			1
sometimes it is used during the first month of pregnancy as well			0
the hormone is routinely prescribed for women who have suffered miscarriages in @entity82 and @entity83 , with almost one - third using pessaries during the first three months			2
it thickens the lining of the womb which helps the embryo become implanted in the womb and supports the growing baby			0
but just hours later she started bleeding and was given the devastating news she had lost the baby			0
after getting over the initial grief the couple decided to try again and she conceived within a few weeks			0
mrs @entity1 was again told she was low on progesterone but was assured it would not affect the baby			1
but just a couple of weeks after finding out the good news she miscarried again			0
she became pregnant for the third time in february last year but after a few weeks started to bleed			0
progesterone is routinely prescribed for women who have suffered miscarriages in @entity82 and @entity83 , with almost one - third using pessaries during the first three months			1
it thickens the lining of the womb which supports the growing baby			0
but she was told progesterone is given only to @entity110 patients here and her baby looked healthy			2
her world was shattered when she began to bleed more heavily in the weeks that followed - and was told she had miscarried again			0
when she became pregnant for a fourth time in april 2013 , mrs @entity1 pleaded with her gp to give her the hormone , after carrying out her own research online			1
she found a big @entity119 - based trial is underway to settle the question of whether women who have miscarried three times or more should be given progesterone in the early weeks of pregnancy			1
mrs @entity1 and her husband @entity39 , 42 , ( second from left ) had almost given up hope after suffering three miscarriages in 18 months , but now they are delighted @entity54 , now three ( left ) , has sister @entity24 ( right ) as progesterone gel is not available on the @entity34 , she persuaded her gp to give her a private prescription			1
she paid £ 100 to use the gel during the first four months of pregnancy			2
she is pictured here after giving birth to her daughter in november last year but she could n’t afford to wait for the results , and persuaded her gp to give her a private prescription after getting a letter of approval from her miscarriage consultant			1
she paid £ 100 to use the vaginal gel during the first four months of pregnancy before weaning herself off it			0
she was delighted when she gave birth to her healthy baby girl in november last year			2
the radio dj and part - time barmaid is glad she took matters into her own hands – but hopes other women will not have to do the same			0
she said : ‘ on forums i found people who had gone to @entity110 wards and begged people who had leftover prescriptions to sell them to them			0
‘ it seems like common sense to prescribe people with progesterone if they need it			2
i do n't want anybody to go through what i did if it can be avoided			0
’ mrs @entity1 awaits the results of a large @entity119 - based trial , which will decide whether women who have had recurrent miscarriages should be prescribed the gel in early pregnancy professor @entity170 , consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at @entity173 ’s @entity172 , believes the hormone is ‘ perfectly safe ’ and every case should be judged on its own merits			1
prof @entity170 said : ‘ on this occasion it is great that the progesterone helped the patient			0
‘ i am a fan of progesterone and use it for many patients who have had recurrent miscarriage and also undergoing certain aspects of fertility treatment			0
‘ my personal feeling is that , until there is definitive rigorous evidence that progesterone has been shown in randomised clinical trials to reduce the risk of miscarriage and improve the outcome of pregnancy , then it should not be widely prescribed			1
‘ hopefully when we do get results of the trial we will know one way or another whether progesterone has a role in this very important and sad area			0

@entity1 desperately wanted a sibling for her son @entity54
three miscarriages left her devastated and she almost gave up hope
after researching online she begged her gp to prescribe progesterone gel
this gel is widely prescribed for infertility in @entity213 but not in the @entity119
