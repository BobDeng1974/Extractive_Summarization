by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity3 @entity2 blocked an election - year @entity5 bill on wednesday that would have boosted the federal minimum wage to $ 10.10 from $ 7.25 an hour			1
the vote was 54 - 42 in favor of allowing debate on the measure to proceed , six votes short of the 60 that @entity5 needed to prevail			0
sen. @entity13 was the only @entity2 to cross party lines and vote ' yes			2
' @entity16 switched his vote to ' no , ' which gives him the right to call another vote on the measure			0
no other democrats opposed the bill			0
even if the @entity3 had voted on passed the legislation , it would have died in the @entity25 , which is controlled by @entity2			1
' millions of @entity39 workers will be watching how each senator votes today			0
to them , it 's a matter of survival , ' senate majority leader @entity16 said before the vote			0
he pointedly added , ' for republicans , this vote will demonstrate whether they truly care about our economy			0
' @entity16 blamed @entity2 reluctance to pass minimum wage legislation on conservative billionaires @entity52 and @entity53			1
president @entity54 blasted @entity2 in a statement after the vote			1
' they said " no " to helping millions work their way out of poverty , ' @entity54 said			1
the president characterized the issue of raising the minimum wage as ' a very simple one			1
' ' either you 're in favor of raising wages for hard working @entity39 , or you 're not , ' said @entity54 , who named raising the minimum wage as one of his goals for 2014 in the president 's annual @entity70 in january			1
after the vote president @entity54 blasted republicans for saying , ' " no " to helping millions work their way out of poverty ' republicans , solidly against the @entity5 proposal , say it would be too expensive for employers and cost jobs			1
as ammunition , they cite a february study by the nonpartisan @entity82 that estimated the increase to $ 10.10 could eliminate about 500,000 jobs — but also envisioned higher income for 16.5 million low - earning people			2
' @entity88 @entity5 ' true focus these days seems to be making the far left happy , not helping the middle class , ' said @entity3 minority leader @entity90 , @entity91			2
' this is all about politics , ' said no. 2 @entity95 leader @entity94 of @entity97			0
" this is about trying to make this side of the aisle look bad and hard - hearted			0
" the legislation , authored by @entity5 sen. @entity28 , would gradually raise the $ 7.25 hourly minimum to $ 10.10 over 30 months and provide automatic annual increases to account for inflation			1
@entity28 's bill would also gradually increase the minimum wage for tipped workers like waiters to 70 percent of the minimum for most other workers			1
it is currently $ 2.13 hourly , which can be paid as long as their hourly earnings with tips total at least $ 7.25			2
@entity5 argue that if fully phased in by 2016 , @entity28 's legislation would push a family of three above the federal poverty line — a level such earners have not surpassed since 1979			0
the minimum wage was first enacted in 1938 and set at 25 cents			2
@entity123 has passed nine laws slowly increasing it , including one each decade since the 1980s			0
the minimum has been $ 7.25 since 2009			1
sen. @entity126 , a @entity2 from @entity127 who has been seeking a deal with other senators on a lower figure than $ 10.10 , said on wednesday that she will continue that effort			1
@entity127 sen. @entity132 , an independent who usually sides with @entity5 , said he too favors finding middle ground			0
but @entity5 leaders have shown no inclination to do that — a view shared by unions that favor an increase and business groups that oppose one			0
' we 're not going to compromise on $ 10.10 , ' @entity16 told reporters after the vote			1
in a clear sign of the political value @entity5 believe the issue has , @entity5 said they intend to force another vote on the increase closer to this year 's elections			0
the @entity25 issued a statement urging the bill 's passage and saying the administration wants legislation ' to build real , lasting economic security for the middle class and create more opportunities for every hardworking @entity39 to get ahead			1
' ' the senators who voted no today are doing contrary to the wishes of the @entity39 people , ' @entity25 press secretary @entity159 said after the vote			0
' there is a reason to do this , and we ought to see republicans acting in the interest of @entity39 to get it done			0
' supporters note that the minimum wage 's buying power has fallen			1
it reached its peak value in 1968 , when it was $ 1.60 hourly but was worth $ 10.86 in today 's dollars			0
the legislation is opposed by business groups including the @entity179 and the @entity180			0
the @entity181 has hundreds of members at the @entity183 this week lobbying lawmakers on several issues , including opposition to a higher minimum wage			2
also opposed were conservative organizations including @entity189 and @entity190			0
opposition from republicans running the @entity25 makes it unlikely that chamber would debate minimum wage legislation this year			1
according to the federal @entity198 , about two - thirds of the 3.3 million people who earned $ 7.25 an hour or less last year worked in service jobs , mostly food preparation and serving			2
more than 6 in 10 of those making $ 7.25 or under were women , and about half were under age 25			2
@entity5 hope their support for a minimum wage boost will draw voters from both groups — who usually lean @entity5 — to the polls in november , when @entity3 control will be at stake			1
the @entity95 's hold on the @entity25 is not in doubt			0
@entity28 's legislation also would provide automatic annual increases in the minimum wage to account for inflation			1
the bill could come back up for a vote in the @entity3 this year ' @entity88 @entity5 ' true focus these days seems to be making the far left happy , not helping the middle class , ' senate minority leader @entity90 , center , told reporters after the vote			2

the legislation proposed hiking the minimum wage up to $ 10.10 an hour from $ 7.25 an hour
the bill included automatic annual increases in the minimum wage
as expected , @entity3 @entity2 blocked the legislation from coming to a vote
even if the legislation has come to a vote and passed , it would have died in the @entity25 , which is controlled by republicans
but that did *n't* ease president @entity54 's anger . ' they said " no " to helping millions work their way out of poverty , ' he said after the vote
