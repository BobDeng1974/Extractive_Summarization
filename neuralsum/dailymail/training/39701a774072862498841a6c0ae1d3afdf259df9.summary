they may look like a completely alien species in our eyes , but new research suggests that our brains share a surprising link with sea anemones and jellyfish			2
scientists have discovered a key evolutionary spurt that allowed animals to develop complex brains occurred in a common ancestor we share with the brightly coloured sea creatures			1
biologists have found genes responsible for enabling electrical communication between nerve cells first occurred 600 million years ago			1
while humans have been around for about 2.5 million years , the beating of our hearts is controlled by something much older			1
scientists have uncovered an ancient molecular pathway that they believe may be between 700 million to a billion years old			2
the discovery was made after researchers in @entity38 studied the evolution of the nervous and muscular systems of a starlet sea anemone			1
they found that the genes responsible for the movement of sea anemones belongs to the same family that triggers slow - wave contractions of the human heart			2
after cloning the genes , the researchers found that its function remained relatively unchanged since the time of humans ' and cnidarians ' divergence from their common ancestor almost a billion years ago			1
the scientists have traced the origins of these genes to an ancient form of sea life that both humans , sea anemones and jellyfish are descended from			1
in jellyfish and sea anemones the genes allow the creatures to move and sense their surroundings			2
faults in these genes in humans are also known to cause epilepsy and other neurological diseases			2
the biologists behind the new research hope that their findings can be used to help better understand how these diseases occur			0
dr @entity79 , who led the work at @entity81 , said : ' we had always assumed that we would be able to trace most of these signaling systems to the earliest nervous systems , but in this paper we show that this is not the case			0
' it looks like the majority of these signaling systems first appear in the common ancestor that humans share with jellyfish and sea anemones			0
' humans and sea anemones went their separate ways evolutionary speaking roughly 600 million years ago , so we know that the mechanisms we use to generate impulses in our neurons must be at least that old			1
' our neurons use tiny proteins known as ion - channels that form openings in the cell membranes to allow charged particles such as potassium to flow in and out			0
comb jellies like those pictured above , have the most basic nervous system in animals today that is very different from our own suggesting ion channels developed after they split from sea anemones and jellyfish these then trigger waves of electrical impulses to flow through the nerve cells			1
ion - channels are now found in almost all living organisms and are crucial to allow neurons to coordinate themselves and develop complex networks			1
sea anemones have nervous systems that allow them to coordinate movement and respond to their surroundings , but do not have a brain or any other analogous organs			0
recent genome sequences from comb jellies - another marine organism that also has a nervous system - has shown that they do not have the same kind of channels			0
it suggests that the ion channels we now use evolved after the cnidarians , which include jelly fish , coral and sea anemones , separated from the ctenophora like comb jellies			0
dr @entity79 said that the genes for potassium ion channels are thought to have occurred instead in an branch of the animal evolutionary tree known as parahoxozoa			0
he said : ' it appears that animals such as sea anemones and jellyfish are using the same channels that shape electrical signals in our brains in essentially the same way			1
sea anemone polyps like the one above has a surprising evolutionary link to our own complex brains ' we do n't yet understand why our ion channels evolved at that time , but the changes in the ability of nerve cells to generate electrical signals must have been revolutionary			1
' our current favorite hypothesis is that neurons capable of directional signaling might have evolved at this time			0
in human nervous systems , most nerve cells have a polar structure with separate regions for inputs and outputs			2
this allows for directional information flow and highly complex circuits of nerve cells , but it requires a huge diversity of ion channels to shape the electrical signals as they pass through the polar nerve cells			1
dr @entity79 said that the research could help provide new insights into studying human diseases			0
he said : ' one of the major limitations on our ability to understand the relationship between human ion channel mutations and disease , is that we actually do n’t know enough about the unique role many ion channels play in neuronal signaling			0
' it is hard to know what to fix if you do n’t know what is broken			0
' in our evolutionary studies , we are trying to get at the very reason why we have these potassium channels in the first place , and we hope that will give us some important new insights into their functional roles in neuronal signaling			0

@entity81 scientists traced the evolution of genes in neurons
the genes allowed nerve cells to communicate with rapid electrical pulses
they say the genes first appeared in parahoxozoa 600 million years ago
parahoxozoa are animals that the ancestors of sea anemone and humans
the genes allowed neurons to form complex networks like those in brains
the findings could help provide some clues about the causes of epilepsy
