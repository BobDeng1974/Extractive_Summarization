' the most perfect woman ' : @entity1 with his wife of 25 years , @entity2 magician @entity1 says men dominate his profession because they are ‘ more creative ’ than women			1
the 75 - year - old , who started teaching himself tricks at the age of 11 , blamed a female obsession with fashion , saying this led to girls giving up toys at a younger age than boys , focusing instead on clothes			1
and he went further by saying that although there were some women in the industry , their tricks were less inventive than their male counterparts			1
@entity1 said : ‘ there is a reason there are fewer female magicians – girls give up toys sooner than boys			1
around the age of eight they want fashion items			1
‘ there are women who are starting to see it as a business , but they do tricks straight out of the box			2
’ @entity1 , who rose to fame with his long - running @entity41 programme , @entity42 , also said there were fewer roles for older magicians			1
he said donning a wig for his programme of 15 years was ‘ one of the smartest decisions i ever made ’			2
@entity1 added : ‘ i was 32 and the industry was suddenly getting very young			1
i thought , “ how am i going to survive this ? ” ’ @entity1 , who now performs at a range of venues including casinos , theatres and village halls , described feeling an ‘ enormous relief ’ when his tv show ended in 1994			1
successful : @entity1 , with @entity2 , rose to fame on the @entity1 on the @entity41 he joked about being ‘ an international sex symbol ’ because his work takes him around the world , and revealed : ‘ @entity63 pays me very well			1
‘ people must think of me as quite famous because i get sent a lot of packages			2
‘ they are mostly from families of magicians who have died – they send boxes of tricks they do n’t know what to do with			2
‘ i keep some in my shed and sell the rest on @entity73			2
’ he added : ‘ @entity81 or @entity82 to me is like comparing @entity74 to @entity75			0
they ’re both very nice guys , but my focus is comedy			0
i want to entertain , to make people laugh			0
’ yet he admitted he was ‘ not a social animal ’ , a trait he considers to be a hang - up from ‘ being the small kid with a largish head and sticky - out ears ’			0
and while he says his profession is a younger man ’s game , the magician said his personal life had bettered with age			0
he lives with his second wife , @entity2 , 54 , to whom he has been married for 25 years			0
long - lasting : @entity1 says that if something goes wrong in his 25 - year marriage to @entity2 , they both just shrug it off @entity1 , who famously claimed in 2000 to have bedded more than 300 women , told the @entity101 : ‘ @entity102 can be great in your seventies – no @entity105 needed – and it certainly beats fish and chips			1
but i do n’t think that ’s the love bit			0
’ he added : ‘ the best thing i ever did in my life was marry @entity2			0
‘ she really is the most perfect woman and we laugh a lot			0
when something goes wrong we just look at each other and shrug			0
