by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 two of @entity4 ’s greatest goalscorers , sir @entity2 and @entity5 , backed @entity6 to shine at the @entity7			1
@entity6 , who has failed to score in the last two tournaments in @entity9 and @entity10 , is coming under pressure for his place in @entity13 after another lacklustre showing against @entity15 last week			1
but as @entity4 prepare to face @entity16 tonight , @entity17 , whose international record of 49 goals puts him 11 ahead of @entity6 , thinks that the @entity22 striker is the only truly world - class player in @entity24 ’s squad			1
time to shine : @entity6 will start for @entity4 against @entity16 time to impress : @entity6 will look to get on the score sheet against @entity16 ‘ @entity6 will have to play , ’ @entity2 told @entity26			1
‘ he ’s got that something extra			0
he will thrive on a successful performance in the @entity7			0
‘ @entity6 is the only one that comes to mind when you think , “ where are our class players coming from ? ” ‘ in every position there seems to be a little bit of doubt in my mind , apart from @entity6			1
golden boot : @entity5 was the top scorer at @entity41 despite going into the tournament under pressure backing : sir @entity2 says @entity6 is @entity4 's only star ‘ i tell him , “ if anybody is going to beat my record for the number of goals scored , it had better be you , so do n’t let me down ” , and he said “ ok ”			1
‘ he has a quality that is made for a @entity7			0
’ @entity5 , who scored 30 goals for @entity4 and won the @entity54 at @entity41 , claims that @entity6 can finish as the @entity7 ’s top scorer if @entity24 gives him a vote of confidence now			1
the former @entity59 striker said : ‘ three weeks before @entity41 , @entity60 ( @entity61 ) said to me , “ whatever happens between now and the first game you ’re going to start ”			0
that gave me great confidence			0
' i think @entity24 will say the same to @entity6			2
i finished the tournament as top scorer and @entity6 can do the same			2
‘ i do n’t think @entity6 will want it on his record that he ’s been to three @entity72 and not scored in any			2
‘ he should start against @entity73 ( in the first group game on june 14 ) but then it ’s whether he performs or not because we have other players now who can produce moments of magic			2
‘ @entity81 can score as he showed the other night			0
the pressure is on @entity6 like there is on any other player			0
he ’s one of the biggest names in the world so everyone wants to talk about him			0

@entity6 's position coming under *scrutiny*
sir @entity2 says @entity6 is @entity4 's only star
@entity5 says @entity6 should start against @entity73 but then it is up to him to prove himself
