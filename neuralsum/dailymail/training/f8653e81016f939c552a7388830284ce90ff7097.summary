the last time we endured a blistering hot summer it buckled railway lines , melted roads and had millions of us wilting			0
it might be worth warming up to the idea – because extreme heat will become the norm in the @entity9 within 30 years , say forecasters			2
a @entity12 report says heatwaves like that of 2003 – when temperatures soared to a record @entity16 ( @entity17 ) – will happen every other year by the 2040s			1
heatwave : the beatch in @entity21 , @entity22 , on august 6 , 2003			1
scientists expect powerful heatwaves such as the one that hit in 2003 to be commonplace by the 2040s			2
@entity28 : beaches were packed during the 2003 heatwave - pictured are @entity31 in @entity32 ( left ) and @entity33 ( right ) , during the height of summer 2005 hot hot hot : children cool down in the mud on august 6 , 2003 in @entity37 , @entity38 , when the temperature in the @entity9 peaked at @entity40 although it will pile pressure on the health service , water supplies and farming , experts said it may also mean a boom in products such as @entity38 wine as conditions improve for heat - loving plants			1
winters are also expected to become generally milder – with the occasional very cold one , as occurred in 2010			0
professor @entity55 , head of the @entity12 ’s @entity56 , said : ‘ at the moment , we ’re able to say that by the 2040s we can expect events like 2003 to be normal			0
’ in fact by the end of the century , 2003 could even be viewed as a cold summer if trends continue , he said			0
but along with hotter summer months we could be heading for more frequent heavy winter downpours			1
‘ heavy rain is becoming heavier and that ’s consistent with our picture of a warming world and warming atmosphere , ’ said professor @entity55			0
freezing : people will still have to plan for the occasional very cold winter , as occurred in 2011			2
the @entity73 naer @entity72 is seen in december of that year extra cold winter : an elderly woman peers out from a bus shelter as dog walkers make their way through heavy snow fall in @entity79 on december 16 , 2011 the report points to a combination of natural processes and human influences on @entity9 ’s changing climate			1
it blamed a series of recent wet summers on natural climate variation , but said man could be partly responsible for the blisteringly hot 2003			2
the report concluded : ‘ the @entity9 has seasonal weather that varies hugely from year to year due to natural processes			1
‘ nevertheless , human influence has been detected in the hot temperatures experienced in @entity93 during the summer of 2003 , and there are signs that the character of rainfall has shifted in the last 50 years with slightly more heavy rainfall events , consistent with a warmer atmosphere holding more water			0
flooding : heavy downpours are becoming more frequent in the @entity9 - a pattern likely to be linked to climate change			1
@entity104 in @entity105 is seen last month devastation : people look over flooded fields which persisted over farmland surrounding @entity110 in @entity105 , earlier this year			0
this photo was taken in january ' other seasons , such as the cold winter of 2010/11 and the wet summer of 2012 appear to be associated with natural fluctuations in the @entity9 ’s varied climate			1
’ professor @entity117 , from the @entity118 , said warmer temperatures could cause wheat yields to drop by up to ten per cent			0
but there would also be more ‘ opportunities ’ for @entity9 farmers – who would be able to grow new crops such as grapes and maize , he added			0
more than 2,000 people are thought to have died of heat - related causes in the @entity9 in 2003 , and 20,000 in the rest of @entity93			1
alongside traffic chaos , hosepipe bans were imposed and rising demand for air conditioning caused electricity ‘ brownouts ’ .			0

more than half of summers by 2040s are likely to be hotter than in 2003
20,000 people died in heatwave which peaked in august that year
weather experts say people will still have to plan for cold winters
heavy downpours are becoming more frequent in @entity9
climate change is also likely to affect @entity9 *'s* food supplies and *prices*
