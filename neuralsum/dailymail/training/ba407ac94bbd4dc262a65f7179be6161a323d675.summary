thousands of @entity2 supporters took to @entity3 in the days after @entity6 pilot @entity4 was captured to suggest sick methods of execution - including the two techniques that ultimately resulted in his death , it emerged today			1
@entity12 was seen being burnt alive before being run over by a bulldozer in a 22 - minute - long video released by the terror group yesterday , in which the level of barbarism and brutality sunk to new lows , even by @entity2 ' depraved standards			1
the method of murder raises the chilling prospect that @entity2 may have been influenced by the @entity3 campaign , which used the @entity26 hashtag # @entity27 to elicit ideas from the terror group 's supporters			1
brutal : the sickening decision to burn @entity6 pilot @entity4 alive may have come from @entity3 after @entity2 supporters launched a hashtag calling for execution ideas in the days after his capture captured : @entity12 was caught by @entity2 militants on december 24 when his f - 16 fighter jet suffered mechanical problems and crash - landed close to @entity2 ' @entity41 stronghold and de facto capital @entity43 horror : a @entity3 user calling himself @entity45 suggested using wild animals to execute @entity12 before suggesting death by chainsaw or melting with acid as possible alternatives			1
no escape : the idea to place the pilot in a cage may have come from a @entity3 user calling himself @entity56 , who tweeted : ' [ @entity57 ] suggest bringing a hungry crocodile and put it in a cage with the pilot ' in the days after @entity12 's capture - which occurred on december 24 when his f - 16 fighter jet suffered mechanical problems and crash - landed close to @entity2 ' @entity41 stronghold and de facto capital raqqa - militants used @entity3 to crowd source ideas for his execution			1
a film clip featuring a woman who claimed to be the mother of a @entity41 man killed in a coalition airstrike suggested ' impalement , not with a mercy shooting or a mercy knife			0
' another horrific idea from a @entity3 user calling himself @entity78 was to either place @entity4 in a tank and set it alight , or to use acupuncture needles dipped in acid to disfigure him , before cutting of his head and sending it head back to @entity6			0
a second hashtag labelled # @entity89 and carrying more brutal execution ideas and videos of children killed in coalition airstrikes , was retweeted over 11,000 times			1
it is not known whether any of those taking part in the campaign - including the organisers of the hashtag - have any sway with the @entity2 leadership and whether any of the ideas influenced the eventual decision to murder @entity12 by burning him alive			1
but what the horrific suggestions do show is the outrageous levels of barbarism and hatred among @entity2 ' supporters , many of whom live in the @entity113 , far from the terror group 's self - declared caliphate			1
it is also important to note that following the gruesome video 's release @entity2 supporters attempted to justify death by burning and bulldozer as a similar fate met by those killed in an airstrike - suggesting bombing victims are often burnt and crushed to death in their homes			1
barbaric : an @entity2 extremist lights a trail of petrol leading to the cage in which the 26 - year - old stands depraved : the flames reach the cage holding the helpless pilot			2
it is later flattened by a bulldozer the sickening @entity3 campaigns appear to have been a reaction to the hashtag # @entity138 where individuals praised the pilot and offered prayers and support for his family after his capture			1
that original hashtag was retweeted more than 200,000 times and was supported by @entity147 and crown prince @entity148			0
the early nature of the campaign suggests reports that @entity2 executed @entity12 at the beginning of january may well be accurate			2
experts add that the slick , professionally shot 22 - minute video would have taken some time to edit			1
the footage of @entity12 's eventual murder was laced with highly symbolic imagery , not least the fact he appears to have been killed in a rubble - strewn courtyard damaged by coalition war planes			1
shocking : a film clip featuring a woman who claimed to be the mother of a @entity41 man killed in a coalition airstrike suggested @entity12 be killed by ' impalement , not with a mercy shooting or a mercy knife ' professional : experts believe that the slick , professionally shot 22 - minute video of @entity12 's murder would have taken some time to edit , suggesting he is likely to have been killed in early january @entity6 officials have told the devastated family of the 26 - year - old ( pictured ) that they believed the footage to be genuine and that the man branded a ‘ hero ’ in his homeland was dead even by the @entity186 's barbaric standards , the terror group 's latest execution video reached a truly depraved new low			1
the footage shows the @entity6 pilot being burnt alive in scenes that are far too shocking to even consider publishing			0
as with previous beheading videos featuring @entity194 executioner @entity193 , the 22 - minute - long clip is characterised by its slick production values and graphics			1
but unlike the others , it contains an added cinematic dimension designed to achieve unparalleled impact on the viewer - as if the horror of watching someone torched to death was n't enough			0
@entity2 blames the @entity207 fighter pilot for burning houses - and killing babies - with airstrikes before he was captured in december			2
relatives of @entity4 held pictures of him at a rally calling for his release early yesterday grief : @entity218 , the wife of @entity4 , appeared at a protest in @entity221 , @entity6 yesterday morning calling for his release			0
just hours later a sickening video emerged of her husband being burnt alive the manner of his death is a symbolic show of strength to strike terror into ' non-believers ' and encourage recruits or doubters within their ranks in equal measure			1
but it appears the @entity2 pr machine was well - aware of the stir the execution footage would cause , even before the disturbing images were circulated online			2
just ten minutes after the video was released , the jihadist group published a checklist of justifications , in a bid to encourage @entity2 supporters to defend the barbaric actions			2
the post , uploaded onto @entity251 jihadi forum @entity249 , offered guidance to @entity2 sympathisers over what they should say if questioned about the merits of the brutal murder			0
in the post , entitled ' @entity258 was @entity259 , below is the @entity262 justification for such an @entity263 ' , it gives a list of apparent defences which it says might be in accordance with @entity262 principles			0
the shocking video of @entity12 's murder comes just days after @entity2 ' @entity194 chief executioner , @entity193 , killed @entity273 journalist @entity272 in a shocking filmed beheading after days of intensive negotiations mr @entity272 joined a list of other victims of @entity193 , including fellow @entity273 national @entity278 ( left )			1
@entity194 aid workers @entity281 ( centre ) , and @entity283 ( right ) have also been murdered @entity285 journalist @entity284 ( left ) was the first to appear alongside @entity193 in one of the sickening videos , followed by @entity288 ( centre )			0
@entity285 aid worker @entity290 ( right ) was also murdered by @entity2 the crowd sourcing of execution ideas , the digital release of the video and the way attempted justifications for the gruesome murder were posted online all reinforce the importance of social media to the @entity2 propaganda machine			1
although the group have been fighting in @entity304 since at least 2004 and have had a presence in @entity41 for many years , @entity2 ' declaration of a caliphate last summer saw support for the terror group rocket , largely driven by the highly active social media use of its fighters			0
@entity311 who appear in the group 's officially released propaganda videos become virtual online celebrities , holding question and answer sessions and giving advise on the website @entity319 , and using @entity3 to share details of the daily life as a terrorist fighting in the @entity323			0
many of the militants use @entity326 as a lingua franca , not least for its potential to reach , influence and possibly even recruit would - be jihadis still living in the @entity113			0
the use of a @entity194 national as @entity2 ' executioner in chief has had the same effect , leading to supporters regularly sharing images of the killer known as @entity193 and sharing quotes taken from the sickening murder videos in which he has appeared			2
@entity6 has executed two @entity2 - linked prisoners , including a would - be female suicide bomber , it has been revealed this morning			0
the executions , at about 4am local time today , came just hours after @entity186 militants released a sickening video showing a captured @entity6 fighter pilot being burned alive in a cage			2
@entity6 had vowed a swift and lethal response and government officials this morning revealed that two prisoners , @entity354 and @entity355 , have already been hanged			0
failed suicide bomber @entity354 ( pictured inside a military court in 2006 ) and @entity355 , have already been executed after @entity6 promised a swift response to the video of @entity4 's murder taken away : an ambulance believed to be transporting the bodies of @entity304 @entity354 and @entity355 leaves @entity363 prison near @entity221 after the @entity365 militants were executed @entity366 had been on death row for her role in a triple hotel bombing in the @entity6 capital @entity221 in 2005 that killed dozens			2
the executions took place after gruesome footage emerged showing @entity6 pilot @entity4 being torched to death by his captors			2
this morning , government spokesman @entity379 announced that two of those prisoners had been executed			0
@entity366 was hanged at dawn alongside @entity355 , an @entity304 @entity365 operative , who was convicted in 2008 for killing a @entity6			0
the executions took place at @entity363 prison about 50 miles ( 80 kilometers ) south of the @entity6 capital of @entity221			0
at sunrise , two ambulances carrying the bodies drove away from the prison with security escorts .			0
