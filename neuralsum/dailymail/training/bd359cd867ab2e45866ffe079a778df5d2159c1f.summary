by @entity1 correspondent two - thirds of parents of overweight children are in denial – and some even think their youngsters are in need of fattening up , a study found			1
the researchers warned that parents need to recognise the problem if they are to tackle it			2
in @entity14 , 22 per cent of children are overweight or obese on starting school			1
by age 10 or 11 , 33 per cent have a weight problem			1
many parents do not realise their children are overweight but it can cause a lifetime of health problems although it is easy to dismiss chubbiness as puppy fat that will be grown out of , childhood obesity can create a lifelong legacy of health problems from heart disease to cancer and diabetes			1
it may also affect a child ’s chances in life , with recent research finding obese schoolchildren get lower grades			2
in the latest study , the @entity40 researchers weighed and measured more than 16,000 boys and girls aged between two and nine and from eight @entity45 countries			0
parents were asked their perception of their child ’s weight			0
this revealed that 63 per cent of parents of overweight children thought them to be a normal size			1
in some cases , parents of children who were so overweight that they were classed as obese believed them to be underweight			1
the @entity57 on @entity58 heard that perceptions were most skewed in southern @entity45 countries – where obesity rates are higher than in the north			0
the @entity64 researchers said this suggests that our idea of a healthy weight is based on what we see around us			0
so , if a child ’s friends are overweight , we believe it is normal for our child to be a similar size			0
parents may also dismiss dangerous levels of plumpness as ‘ puppy fat ’ that will be grown out of			1
@entity79 said : ‘ but research does n’t support that at all			0
‘ the vast majority of children that are obese aged four will remain obese for the rest of their lives			0
’ he added that the tendency of well - meaning grandparents and divorced parents to spoil children is also a ‘ great problem ’			2
dr @entity79 added that regular weighing and measuring of children from a young age could help get the message across to parents			2
the threat of childhood obesity will be one of the main themes discussed at the @entity103 conference			1
professor @entity104 , president - elect of the @entity105 , which is running the event , said : ‘ once people become obese it is very hard for them to return to a normal body weight			0
’ the study did n’t include the @entity111			0
however , previous @entity111 research has come up with similar figures , with seven in ten parents of overweight children refusing to accept the problem			1
plus , @entity111 adults are increasingly failing to recognise that their own weight is an issue .			0

by age 10 or 11 , one third of children in @entity14 are overweight
childhood obesity can lead to a lifetime of health issues
research *shows* obese children do worse *academically*
parents often *mistake* a weight problem for ' puppy fat '
