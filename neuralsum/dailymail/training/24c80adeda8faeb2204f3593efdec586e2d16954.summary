@entity8 , 57 , claims his floating home is not a permanent house and he is therefore not liable to pay rates to his local authority			1
but after a three - year legal battle the @entity13 yesterday ruled the boat is liable for council tax if it remains moored in the same spot for a year			1
@entity8 ( pictured left with his family in their home ) claims the boat ( right ) is not a permanent home and so he should therefore not have to pay council tax the boat features a music room large enough for music teacher @entity23 's grand piano the handyman , his wife @entity25 , 55 , and son @entity24 , 15 , live on the 70ft boat which has a kitchen , two bedrooms , a 330 sq ft sitting room and an open fireplace			1
council chiefs who discovered @entity33 's unusual living arrangements slapped him with a demand for £ 1,000 a year in council tax			2
but mr @entity36 says he should n't have to pay @entity37 because he does n't use their services			1
his 1950s , @entity41 - built tug , named @entity42 , generates its own power through solar panels and the family drink rainwater			1
mr @entity36 said : ' the council 's valuators want to band us with cottages and bungalows but we live in a tidal estuary and use a dinghy to get to the shore			0
' we just do n't get the sort of services someone gets in a proper house , on a proper estate , in a proper village or a proper anything			1
@entity8 , pictured with his wife @entity25 and son @entity24 , says the family do not receive the same council services as other rate - payers ' we 're off the grid			1
we generate our own electricity			0
we do n't live on a houseboat - we live on a proper boat			1
' mr @entity36 bought the boat in 2001 for £ 11,000 after he said he became fed up with living in a run - down estate in @entity72			1
the family moved in almost immediately and began gutting the heavy engine machinery to make room for their new home			0
more than a decade later the 70ft boat has a much smaller engine and living quarters split over two levels			1
mr @entity36 bought the boat in 2001 for £ 11,000 after he said he became fed up with living in a run - down estate in @entity72			2

mr @entity36 said : ' my wife 's dream was always to run a musical bed and breakfast so she wanted to buy a place to fix up in the countryside			0
' i was pretty certain that even a bombed - out doghouse was going to cost more than we ever had and that proved to be the case			2
' but i 'd lived on boats before and i said why do n't we buy a big @entity128 barge and live in it			2
the tug was the closest we came to finding one			2
' it was all engine room back then but i pulled out 30 tonnes of machinery , put back in a much smaller engine and started to convert the rest into living space			0
' most of the hard work is now done but there are still bits and pieces left to do			0
' mr @entity8 's legal battle began in 2010 when they moved from @entity72 to @entity90 and their self - sufficient lifestyle was featured in a newspaper article			1
readers accused the family of dodging council tax and mr @entity36 says he wrote to the council to offer them a goodwill payment			0
he explained he had been moored in the same spot for more than a year so council evaluators replied to tell him he owed £ 1,000			2
currently moored along a tidal estuary near @entity89 , @entity90 , its lower deck boasts a spacious 15ft by 22ft living room , a bathroom and two bedrooms after a series of hearings the case reached @entity162 's @entity13 yesterday where judge sir @entity163 decided the @entity164 becomes a taxable home when it stays permanently in the same spot			1
mr @entity36 has challenged @entity37 in the wake of the ruling to reveal how much taxpayers ' cash they spent chasing him			0
he says his own fees were met by legal aid because of his family 's low income			0
mr @entity36 said : ' i do n't make an awful lot of money but i pay as much tax as anybody else in my circumstances			2
we 've never been on the dole			0
we 're not scroungers or looking to cheat the system			0
after a three - year legal battle the @entity13 has now ruled the boat is liable for @entity187 council tax if it remains moored in the same spot for a year ' if i had a houseboat sitting in a residential marina , with a postie slotting mail through my door , a wheelie bin and a parking space i 'd be more than willing to pay - but we have none of these things			1
' i 'm still baffled as to what the council hope to get out of this			0
i 'd love to know how much they 've spent pursuing me - it 's a criminal waste of money			0
' government rules say people who live on houseboats at a residential mooring have to pay council tax .			0
