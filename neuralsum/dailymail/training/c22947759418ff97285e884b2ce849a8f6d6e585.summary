by @entity0 published : 06:14 est , 6 june 2012 updated : 07:25 est , 6 june 2012 the parents of a 15 - year - old boy who plunged to his death in @entity4 have made a desperate plea for information amid fears their son could have been pushed			1
police initially ruled the death of @entity11 , who fell more than 100ft from an 11 - storey building after an alcohol - fuelled party , was a suicide			1
but more than two months after his parents @entity17 and @entity19 refused to accept he ended his own life , investigators are looking into the possibility someone else could have been involved			1
tragic : @entity11 , 15 , plunged more than 100ft to his death in @entity4 after an alcohol - fuelled row at the heart of their inquiries is a mystery brawl with strangers who were not at the teenagers ' illicit gathering			1
officers are looking at @entity34 footage showing three figures in the lobby of the building shortly before @entity11 disappeared			2
they are also investigating claims there was a clash between the 42 partygoers and three unknown people who complained about noise and loud music			0
grieving : @entity17 and @entity45 , pictured , are being comforted by fellow expats following the death of their son @entity11 , who had told his parents he was staying with friends on the night of march 23 , disappeared at midnight shortly after the mystery callers to the flat in @entity4 's @entity52			1
he rowed with a friend and stormed out , with the last trace of him alive a message on @entity56 reading ' f * * * the system '			1
his body was found at the base of the building at 9.30am the next day			0
his parents have said it is impossible their ' happy , loved and loving ' son could have taken his own life and are demanding answers about the mystery nine hours in between his disappearance and his body being found			0
mr @entity11 , 49 , a former trader in the @entity68 , said in an appeal letter to residents in the building where he died : ' we firmly believe that our son would not have been on his own after saying : ‘ i ’m getting a taxi , i ’m going home ’			2
' we have full faith in @entity4 police and know the officials are doing their best			0
however , it simply does n’t make sense for @entity11 to say he is getting a cab home and then his body being found at the bottom of the building			2
' something must have happened in between			0
how can anyone let a 15 - year - old boy die at a public place and not report it ? ' i appeal to all those who may have seen or been present when the incident took place to come forward and help bring justice to @entity11			1
' please help if you have seen @entity11 between midnight and 9.30am on march 24			2
' he added : ' even confirmation that @entity11 was not lying at the foot of the building at a particular time would be helpful			2
' this could narrow the timeline of @entity11 's actual fall and is obviously very important			2
we can not understand why no one had seen or heard from @entity11 for over nine and half hours			0
' mr @entity11 , who moved @entity105 , his wife @entity19 , 46 , and daughter @entity106 , 19 , to the @entity108 from @entity109 in @entity110 nine years ago , said no witnesses had come forward to fill in the missing hours			0
' as parents , we are appealing for any information , anonymous or otherwise , that may help us to explain his last eight hours of movements			0
happy : @entity11 , 15 , had been drinking at a party into the early hours of saturday morning before becoming separated from his friends distraught : @entity11 was in @entity118 at @entity119 in the @entity108			1
head teacher @entity120 said counselling was available to distraught staff and pupils ' did you see or hear anything that morning ? have there been any unauthorised parties held on the floors of that same building in the recent past ? ' the all - male bring - your - own - booze party had been held in a flat left empty by its expatriate owners in a building called @entity135 2			1
in the strict @entity138 country where drinking in public is forbidden and there is limited access to alcohol , teenagers often gather in empty apartments left unlocked for prospective tenants with their own stash of booze , usually ferreted from their parents , to hold iliicit parties			1
@entity11 , a pupil at £ 9,500 - a - year @entity119 , was found at the bottom of the adjoining @entity135 1 , which is connected internally via corridors			1
