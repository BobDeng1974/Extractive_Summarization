@entity0 had just performed his latest act of heroism in a football shirt , dragging @entity4 back from the brink of embarrassment in @entity7 with a brace of supreme quality , when he straight away switched his focus to making history			1
qualification for @entity13 is in his sights now , a first major tournament for @entity4 since the 1958 @entity16			1
plenty of illustrious predecessors have tried and failed , but @entity0 is displaying the bloody - mindedness required to succeed			1
‘ we ’ve got one ticked off the list and we have nine more to go , ’ he said of the @entity7 win and @entity20 matches to come against @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			1
@entity0 is intent on helping @entity4 reach the @entity27 in @entity28 in 2016 @entity0 scored twice as the @entity29 narrowly snuck past lowly @entity7 on tuesday night ‘ i ’ve had a taster of the big nights with @entity32			1
it ’s great to get experience of the highest level of club competition and hopefully i can help us qualify for a major tournament			2
’ if any further evidence was required of how much @entity4 means to the world ’s most expensive player , this was it			1
he produced a match - winning performance inside a stadium holding just 3,300 people in the remote principality in the @entity49			2
he played the full 90 minutes as if it was his last , driving forward until the unthinkable defeat was fully overturned			2
‘ the biggest honour you can have is to play for your country and to see the fans turn out like that for an away game was special , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ i do n’t think many countries could do that			0
‘ i ’ve had some great nights with my club side but i ’m looking forward to our next games in the campaign and hopefully we can get that qualification and have success with @entity4 too			1
’ the winger says he is used to the big nights after helping @entity32 to a @entity71 final win @entity0 strikes a free - kick on the dodgy pitch in @entity7 @entity0 ’s two goals took his total to 14 in 45 caps			1
@entity78 ’s record total of 28 looks under threat			0
up next in october are matches in @entity0 ’s home town of @entity82 against @entity22 and @entity23			1
‘ the next two home games will be key for us , ’ said @entity0			2
his two - goal display was all the more impressive given that he produced it on a terrible artificial surface			2
his team - mate @entity88 hit out at the pitch that has left him fighting for fitness ahead of @entity92 ’s key clash with @entity93 on saturday			2
the midfielder suffered an injury to his right ankle after falling awkwardly on the @entity97			0
the new pitch was certified by @entity99 only last week @entity0 tries to calm down the fans after they rushed onto the pitch following his dramatic winner @entity88 is a doubt for @entity92 's game against @entity93 after rolling his ankle on the surface ‘ the pitch was very hard , there was no give , ’ said @entity88			1
‘ i rolled my ankle late on			0
i hope i ’ll be available for saturday			0
@entity93 at home , those are the games you want to play			0
’ ‘ i just do n’t know how you ’re meant to play football on that pitch			0
it was very frustrating , you could n’t play the ball quickly			0
‘ we could n’t get into our stride			0
normally we play quick , keep it on the floor , play around teams			0
we could n’t do that , we had to take the extra touch			0
i hope that ’s the last time i play on a plastic pitch			0
