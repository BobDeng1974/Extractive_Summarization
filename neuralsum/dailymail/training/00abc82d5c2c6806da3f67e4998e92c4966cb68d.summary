the @entity0 and @entity1 have not always shared the best of relationships			1
over the years , the love life of the monarch 's eldest son has caused her no end of trouble			0
divorce , infidelity rumours , scorchingly embarrassing phone calls made public ... it is no wonder it was said before @entity14 married @entity1 in 2005 that the @entity0 had agreed only ' grudgingly ' to the union			1
but today , the @entity0 and her daughter - in - law looked to have buried any hatchet as they met up at the @entity19			2
indeed , they looked genuinely delighted to see each other			0
the two embraced warmly when they encountered one another at the equestrian event today , with @entity1 leaning in to proffer a kiss to the monarch			1
@entity1 , dressed in a beige trench and carrying a tan snakeskin bag , even held the same sort of transparent birdcage umbrella the @entity0 has favoured for years			2
whether the monarch lent @entity1 the brolly , handcrafted by @entity46 @entity45 firm @entity43 , or whether it was @entity1 's own is unknown - although the black - trimmed umbrella is the same one that @entity1 carried on for the rainy day of the jubilee river pageant last summer			0
the @entity19 , celebrating its 70th anniversary this year , was set up in 1943 to raise money for the war effort			0
still going strong now , it is a chance for breeders the world over to gather and display their horses			0
at ease : the @entity0 and @entity57 seem to share a mutual affection for one another beaming : the @entity0 looked delighted today as she wandered around the equestrian event , held every year in the grounds of @entity61 in her element : the queen is never happier than when she is outdoors with the horses royal two : the queen was joined by her husband prince @entity67 on the third day of the @entity19 @entity1 has used @entity68 ... style stalker : @entity1 carried the black - trimmed @entity71 umbrella on the day of the @entity72 last summer but she 's a fan of old ... the @entity57 carried a black - trimmed @entity71 in 2005 during a visit to the @entity75 on the @entity0 's estate in @entity77 but the @entity0 definitely got there first ... devoted follower of @entity71 : keeping dry at a @entity80 here , and right , the @entity0 tones down her mint green look with a sober black umbrella firm favourite : left , keeping dry on the @entity84 during a rainy cruise of the @entity86 for her 80th birthday , and right , looking stylish despite the rain on an outing to @entity91 in 2007 braving the rain to meets students from the @entity93 in 2004			1
