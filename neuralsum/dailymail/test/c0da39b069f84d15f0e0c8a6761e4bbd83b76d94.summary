@entity1 manager @entity0 claims that covert racism still exists in football boardrooms @entity0 believes that the implementing of a @entity4 could help raise awareness of the ' covert ' issue @entity13 ’ view that black managers find it hard to get a job after being sacked was backed up by @entity0 ‘ the fact we ’re still , at this stage of the game , highlighting that i ’m the only black @entity8 manager shows that it ’s not the norm to have people from ethnic minorities in this position			1
‘ so until this becomes normal , and it ’s not highlighted in such a spectacular fashion , racism will be prominent			0

@entity13 ' last managerial job was at @entity48 in 2009			0
he lasted four months before being sacked @entity0 is operating as the only black manager in the @entity8 as he looks to keep @entity1 up @entity0 was without a job for seven months after leaving his coaching role at @entity51 last season ‘ i think that there are other people who are probably more talented or better suited , from a profile point of view , as many white managers who have got jobs based on their profile and playing experience			1
’ the 52 - year - old manager thinks that discrimination is n’t exclusive to race and that the @entity4 — which obliges @entity65 ’s @entity64 teams to interview minority candidates for top jobs — might be the solution here			2
