is there a secret to buying the perfect engagement ring ? well apparently so , according to one man who has written a how - to buy book for blokes			1
@entity6 , @entity7 who currently lives in @entity8 , @entity9 , was set to pop the question to his now - wife , @entity12 , but had trouble finding the information he needed to hunt down the best ring			1
' i read a book about diamonds on @entity19 by a middle aged lady , but it was all about the technical aspects , ' he said			2
his difficult six month search for ' the one ' prompted him to write a book , ' how to buy an engagement ring ' offering tips for blokes			1
he bought it online and says it was a cheaper option the secret to buying the right ring			1
@entity7 was at a loss how to get the right ring , until he began a worldwide research project ' it did n't help me with a budget , whether i should get my other half involved			1
' so , the 31 year old spent the next six months researching and looking for as many sources of information about engagement rings as he could			1
@entity7 's search began in @entity9 , but when he could n't find what he wanted , he looked elsewhere travelling to other countries on holiday , including @entity51 and @entity6 to look into the world of diamonds			1
' i still had no luck , they could n't give me what i was looking for , i needed all the information i could get			0
' but after six months , his in depth research paid off and he purchased a ring online , pleased he had got what he wanted and paid less than he would have if he bought it in a retail store			1
' i got inside info from two jewellers and one gemologist and in the end got an awesome ring for a great price			2
i nailed it ! ' he said			0
@entity7 proposed to his wife last @entity72 and said a number of his friends were also getting engaged at the time and it seemed that no one knew what they were doing			1
@entity7 , 31 , ( pictured ) who lives in @entity8 , spent six months looking for as many sources of information about engagement rings as he could find , and compiled his research into a book research pays off : @entity7 is pictured with wife @entity12 at their wedding after he bought the right ring after six months of research ' some of them spent a fair bit more , got a smaller ring , a lower quality ring			1
' it 's then that his ring hunt adventures sparked an brilliant idea to help other blokes who were thinking about proposing to their girlfriends			1
@entity7 ( pictured ) at his wedding			1
he proposed to his now wife @entity12 after researching how to buy the best engagement ring for six months the debut author has written a book called ' how to buy an engagement ring ' and he says it 's an easy to follow guide with hints and tips to help men through the daunting process			1
' i wanted to make it easier for other guys going through same thing , millions buy rings every year			2
' everyone makes the same mistakes , use info to make it easier for people to get a better ring			2
' he believes the biggest mistakes men can make is limiting their range of rings on offer , encouraging online purchases			0
' there 's 500,000 diamonds online instead of 50 in stores , ' he said			2
he also recommends playing with the types of the ring and its settings			2
' there 's really big savings to be made if you know what you 're doing			1
' ' diamonds are rated by the four @entity138 , sometimes guys get too caught up in the clarity , but you ca n't really see the difference from the naked eye			0
' guys seem to want purer diamonds , but you ca n't see it , ' he said			0
the book also provides an insight into understanding what women really want ( do n't all men ) , inside info on diamond sourcing and recommended retailers			2
recent research has found that one in ten women would turn down a proposal if they did n't like the ring , putting more pressure than ever on men to get it right			2
most men take an average of four months to find the perfect ring , so the book has been released just in time for the busiest proposal season of the year - christmas			1
and he has even thought of everything for guys wanting to buy the book , to help raising suspicion , the book comes with fake covers , or undercover covers to keep their pending proposal under wraps			2
and if all else fails , and you do n't mind breaking the surprise , @entity7 says why not ask her what ring she would prefer , because then you know you 'll be on the right track			1
' if you were going to ask your wife to pick your fantasy football team , would you trust her ? that could be the case with an engagement ring			1
' @entity189 ( pictured left and right with fiance @entity190 ) used the book ' how to buy and engagement ring ' to get the perfect ring @entity189 and @entity190 ( pictured ) dated for five and a half years before he popped the question			1
@entity189 asked his friend @entity7 for a sneak peek at his " how to buy and engagement ring ' book for some tips but if you must surprise the love of your life , he has encouraged blokes to buy a stone on its own and choose the setting once she says yes			1

' * do n't spend outside your means ' i recommend setting a budget comfortable for you that is a meaningful amount of money			0
' * buy just the stone and get it set after she says yes ' some jewellers will mount it on a mock setting , she can then help you choose the setting			0
' ' a lot of blokes do n't know a lot of about jewellery at all , so looking at her style for hints and tips , matching different ring styles can also help			2
' ' it should get their thoughts a lot more streamlined , just giving them the info to get a great ring and save money			0
' and he recommends , do n't spend outside your means			0

' @entity189 ( pictured left ) and @entity190 ( pictured right ) became engaged five weeks ago			0
@entity189 sought advice from his mates ' book before buying the ring and popping the question			1

' ' had a brief look in shops and was bit blown away by the price , i was totally unaware to look online , ' he said			0
* average cost of engagement ring $ 5300 * percentage saved by selecting the right diamond shape 42 % * diamonds to choose from my ( @entity7 's ) recommended retailer 810652 ' the whole process saved me money			1
' ' it 's an easy read , knowing it is written by a man i can relate to , all info , everything a guy is looking for , think about it in guy terms			0
