click here to read why @entity1 is running out of time to find his best team i hugely admire rugby league as a sport and the players who take the field			1
at its best the balance between athletic prowess , skill - set and sheer bloody toughness makes league one of the great sports			1
i can not wait to see @entity15 play for @entity16 , i ’m sure he has everything to succeed in union and all @entity20 rugby fans should be grateful to @entity16 for bringing him into the sport			1
that said , we need to be realistic — for @entity15 ’s sake as much as anything			1
to suggest @entity15 is the answer to @entity20 ’s poor showing in the backline so far this autumn would be dangerous — he has n’t played a game of union yet ! @entity15 needs to get on with his game , a challenge he ’ll throw himself into			1
@entity15 is expected to make his debut for @entity16 on saturday @entity15 speaks with @entity16 and possible future @entity20 team - mate @entity34 ( left ) during training @entity15 poses with a young baby after attracting crowds to a @entity16 training session but equally the @entity20 setup and their fans ca n’t sit back and think ‘ it ’s ok , we ’ll have @entity15 in a couple of months			1
’ the focus should remain on our current options until he is ready			0
making the transition to union and performing at test match level is going to take time			2
if you put him on the field at @entity52 on saturday he ’d get horribly exposed			2
i ’d love to see him in the @entity55 squad but the time - frame is very tight			1
the biggest challenge for @entity15 will be understanding the technicalities and subtleties of playing at inside centre in both attack and defence			1
as has become apparent this autumn , the @entity63 12 holds the keys to the backline			0
he is not a @entity66 or @entity67 , who can devastate teams with raw speed and athleticism			0
those types of players have tended to be more successful at crossing over codes			2
@entity15 ’s game is based more on explosive power and smashing through tackles			1
at the highest level of rugby union that simply wo n’t be enough			1
he needs to learn a kicking game , gain an understanding of the patterns run in union and work on his distribution			2
the biggest challenge for him will be at the breakdown			0
unlike in league , it is after the hit that so much happens			2
i suspect he wo n’t enjoy hitting rucks but in many ways you do n’t want him smashing into rucks because that would n’t be the best use of his many qualities			0
@entity15 faces a tough challenge after crossing over from rugby league to union the 25 - year - old is congratulated by @entity104 ' owner @entity103 after winning the @entity105 @entity15 has starred for @entity20 at the @entity106 we know how hard he can tackle but how quickly can he get over the ball and how effectively he can hold up his man in a choke tackle ? he has the ability to be world class in this area and the speed at which he learns these skills will be crucial in determining how quickly he progresses into a white @entity20 shirt			1
it is asking a lot for him to be ready in time for the @entity55			1
the more i think about it , i think he will end up playing in the back row			0
if that happens he will not be such a significant addition to @entity20 ’s squad			1
there is already great depth in the back row			0
it is in the midfield that they need new ideas			0
one thing @entity15 will undoubtedly bring is sheer outright toughness			2
i was offered a contract to sign for @entity137 in 1980 but turned it down because i did n’t think i was tough enough to cut in it in @entity139			0
a couple of years later i played union for @entity142 in @entity143 , where the two codes are pretty close			2
i watched a lot of league and it left me with a massive respect for the sport			0
the preparation and detail those players put into every training session and every match was light - years ahead of union at that time			0
@entity15 speaks to @entity16 head coach @entity153 ( left ) ahead of his expected @entity155 debut @entity20 coach @entity1 ( centre ) is still deliberating over his best central line - up @entity158 will replace @entity159 at @entity63 for @entity20 's final @entity160 against @entity161 even today the speed and quality of pass and the ability to simply but so effectively time their running lines from deep always stands out to me			1
they are still ahead of union			0
i would still get @entity15 into the @entity20 camp at the earliest opportunity even if his first start comes later			1
he will raise the standards and will prompt a far greater response than 10 visits from @entity176 and @entity177			0
i ’m not saying @entity15 can not make it as a union player			1
i am sure he will			0
but i would urge caution about the time - frame			0
@entity182 said recently it took him the best part of a year to really feel like a union player			0
@entity15 does not have that time on his side			2
when i became @entity20 head coach i ’d followed league all my life and knew exactly the type of player @entity66 was when i brought him across			1
like @entity67 , @entity66 was a sensational athlete whose quick feet set him apart			0
but i never considered playing him in a key decision - making position such as 12 , one of the most challenging positions			0
@entity66 made a successful crossover from league to union under sir @entity198 all eyes will be on @entity15 if he makes his rugby union debut against @entity201 on saturday it ’s exciting for rugby as a whole that @entity15 could be starting for @entity16 against @entity201			1
he ’s in the perfect place at @entity16 , where @entity153 — a former rugby league player himself — is head coach			1
i really do envy the opportunity to coach him			0
the way you look after someone like @entity15 is by not trying to change them			2
educate them , but allow them to interpret the game themselves			0
if you do that , you might end up with a unique union player			0
i ’m excited about @entity15 and @entity20 rugby fans should be , too			1
but the clock is ticking ahead of the @entity55 .			2

@entity15 has crossed codes from rugby league to rugby union
the former @entity225 star is set to make his @entity16 debut on saturday
it is too early to herald @entity15 as @entity20 's *saviour* at the @entity55
