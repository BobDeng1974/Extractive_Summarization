by @entity0 published : 08:02 est , 6 february 2013 updated : 10:11 est , 6 february 2013 staff watched children 's performances , enjoyed a buffet and listened to speeches as they toasted to the 75th anniversary of one of @entity10 's most notorious @entity9 camps			1
the bizarre party to celebrate the founding of a forced labour camp and attended by local officials and former guards gave little indication to the horrors of its past			1
@entity20 camp in @entity21 , near the @entity23 mountains , held both criminal and political prisoners during the @entity26 years and was set up during the early @entity28 purges aimed to clean the communist union of those with undesirable political opinions			1
@entity32 : current and past members of staff at the @entity36 gulag camps celebrate the 75th anniversary of the opening of the brutal camp with dancing , toasts and balloons contrast : prisoners at a @entity46 gulag in the @entity47 pictured in the late 1920s doing hard labour in the great quarries @entity50 held thousands of political prisoners at any one time and had the higest death rate of any camp under the gulag			1
the @entity9 was the organisation which ran the forced labour camps during the soviet years and is an acronym for chief @entity57			1
@entity9 has also become the noun used to describe the forced labour camps of @entity10			1
it was mainly in function from the early 1930s to the mid 1950s , 53 separate camps and 423 labour colonies in use in march 1940			0
their camps were spread across @entity10 and would hold both criminal and political prisoners whose crimes could be anything from stealing a loaf of bread to being suspected of spreading @entity73 propaganda			2
it is estimated that over 25 million people passed through the @entity9 system , either through imprisonment in work camps , deportations or ‘ labour colonies ’			2
due to the closed system and the common practice to release prisoners as they were about to die , the number of deaths caused by the @entity9 has been estimated to 1.6 million , but could be as much as 10 million			0
proudly announcing the anniversary of the camp , the @entity87 regional department of @entity10 's prison service said the @entity28 police ‘ instilled traditions in the camp that still hold value today			0
' in a statement released to @entity46 press yesterday the ' corrective colony ' said these proud traditions include ' allegiance to the motherland , mutual assistance and respect for war veterans			0
' ‘ so hard were the times in which the @entity20 camp was founded , so heavy were the burdens it overcame ! ’ wrote @entity104 , deputy chairman of the camp 's museum			2
@entity20 was founded in 1938 , and functioned as a timber processing plant			0
it held 10,000 to 30,000 prisoners at any given time , a number which included criminals as well as those convicted of ‘ counter-revolutionary activity ’ and other political crimes			0
more than 16 per cent of prisoners died of malnutrition and overwork , one of the highest rates in the @entity9			1
following the 1953 death of @entity126 , @entity50 transferred its remaining political prisoners in 1955 and was closed in 1960			0
horror : millions of @entity9 prisoners died due to the appalling conditions in the working camps , such as wooden planks as beds with only a blanket to protect them against the @entity135 climate			0

staff of past and present at notorious @entity9 camp celebrated anniversary
@entity20 labour camp was founded in 1938 and had both political and criminal prisoners
it had one of the highest death rates of all @entity9 camps
