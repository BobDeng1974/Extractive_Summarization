@entity0 pauses as he carefully considers the question			1
he has been talking about his journey to @entity3 , from @entity4 to @entity5 via @entity6 , but has now been asked to revisit the life - shaping events of his childhood			1
@entity0 , @entity3 ’s new commanding £ 20million defender , was born in @entity12 , a small town in the former @entity13			1
when the @entity19 war erupted , his father , @entity15 , and mother , @entity17 , made the decision one night in 1992 to flee to @entity21 with him and his brother , @entity22			1
a year later , on april 19 , 1993 , as the conflict spiralled out of control , a market place in his home town came under fire from heavy shelling : 15 people were killed and another 50 seriously injured in what became known as the @entity31			2
‘ i think somebody would have been killed – i do n’t know			2
it was horrible in that time			2
i think in 1992 my parents took the decision and said “ we do n’t have a choice anymore			2
” ‘ my father and mother ’s parents were already in @entity21 so we were the last to go			1
they literally took their bags , one little car and went to @entity21			1
it was difficult for my parents to leave the country after they had been there for 27 , 28 years			0
‘ they said “ come on we need to go to @entity21 ”			1
you do n’t even speak @entity21 , you know nothing about the country so you are going like a blind man			1
and with a three - year - old child like me to take too , it was really difficult for them at that time			1
‘ after seven years in @entity21 the situation calmed down			1
we went back in 1999 ( they were sent back as they did not have the right paperwork )			2
but , you know , i think this is what gave something to me ; made something stronger inside me			0
it showed me that this life is never easy			0
’ difficult childhood : @entity0 and his family were forced to flee to @entity21 during troubles in his homeland humanitarian mission : the @entity75 in @entity19 in 1993 after conflicts in the former @entity13 spiralled out of control if his life in @entity21 ended in sour manner , that was the country were his dreams took flight			1
@entity0 supported @entity85 and would regularly take the subway to stand outside @entity87 , @entity89 ’s fabled headquarters , hunting for pictures and autographs			1
‘ i had my photos taken with @entity93 , ( @entity95 ) @entity94 , ( @entity93 ) lizarazu … i had all these pictures in my room , ’ he recalls			0
‘ i would go to the training ground to see them			0
‘ i was a normal child , playing with the kids			2
it was only when @entity102 wanted to sign me that i felt i had a chance			0
i now sign autographs every time			0
i know what it means for a parents to see their child smiling after the autograph			1
nobody should mind giving up 10 minutes			0
’ @entity0 is not the only @entity111 player to have thrived in the @entity112			1
below are 11 players that grew up in war - torn @entity111 countries and have gone on to shine in @entity118 's top tier			2
@entity119 ( @entity19 ) - @entity120 , @entity121 @entity122 ( @entity123 ) - @entity124 , @entity125 @entity126 ( @entity127 ) - @entity128 @entity0 ( @entity123 ) - @entity5 , @entity129 @entity130 ( @entity127 ) - @entity131 @entity132 ( @entity123 ) - @entity125 @entity133 ( @entity134 ) - @entity135 @entity136 ( @entity127 ) - @entity124 @entity137 ( @entity123 ) - @entity138 , @entity139 @entity140 ( @entity19 ) - @entity124 @entity141 ( @entity123 ) - @entity142 , @entity143 hero : as a youngster , @entity0 would go and have his picture taken with @entity85 stars like @entity93 happy to stop : having queued to meet the likes of @entity149 and @entity94 , @entity0 enjoys taking time out to sign autographs and pose for photos with fans ‘ you will earn everything with work , ’ he adds			1
‘ i said to myself “ i do n’t want to live my life like this ”			0
my parents gave me everything they could but it was not amazing			0
maybe it was better to happen like this than to have a ( privileged ) childhood when you do n’t know the real life			0
’ do not discount the effort it has taken to get where he is			0
from the 100 - mile round trips he would take from @entity170 to @entity4 as a teen , to fighting off critics in @entity173 after his € 10m move to @entity6 – “ they always questioned me ” – @entity0 is not going to be fazed by the task that awaits on @entity177			1
he is only 25 but the maturity and clarity with which @entity0 speaks shows why @entity180 wanted to make him the most expensive defender in @entity3 ’s history ; the leader who could fill the chasm in @entity3 ’s defence since @entity186 retired			1
after scoring in the 4 - 0 win over @entity188 , @entity180 called him ' perfect ' and one aspect which so impressed was how vocal he was ; that may seem a small point but it is significant as @entity186 departure saw an end to orders being bellowed from the back at @entity197			1
best possible start : @entity0 is congratulated after scoring in @entity3 's friendly win over @entity188 ‘ @entity180 said to me because he has seen me as a leader , ’ @entity0 explains			1
‘ i said to him “ i ’m still young			2
” but i will try my best			0
i will lead the team			0
i do n’t have so many experiences like @entity186 but i think it will come with time			0
‘ i said also it ’s a great honour to be compared with a legend like him			0
i have a lot of time in front of me so i will just keep working and it will come one day			0
the first step , inevitably , sees him face @entity5			2
he had a successful year on the @entity212 and , out of respect , he is reluctant to comment on what has unfolded with so much change but does he have regrets ? ‘ yes maybe , a little bit , ’ the @entity123 international replies			1
‘ but i said also to them that i want to leave because @entity3 is a massive club and maybe i will have this chance just one time in my life			2
i did n’t want to see the chance going			0
‘ maybe it was a difficult relationship but , at the end , everybody agreed and that ’s most important			0
i shook their hands , said goodbye so now it is finished			0
it was destiny ( to play them )			0
i will just have to concentrate on my game and i wo n’t think about @entity5			2
this is a new beginning			0
’ once in a lifetime opportunity : @entity0 poses next to the @entity237 at @entity3 's @entity239 training ground			1

@entity0 was forced to flee to @entity21 as a child after the @entity19 war erupted during the early *90s*
