as clubs begin their business in the january transfer window , managers around @entity1 would be wise to cast an eye towards the summer too			1
players whose contracts expire at the end of this season can now talk to clubs outside the country they 're playing in , giving bosses a chance to agree transfers without the need for a fee			1
with some huge bargains to be had , @entity17 takes a look at a select xi who could be tempted to agree a deal elsewhere this month			2
@entity23 ( @entity24 ) the man who saved two @entity27 penalties in the @entity29 semi-final could well be leaving @entity30 at the end of this season			0
@entity33 's stopper - who was shortlisted for the @entity34 in @entity35 - would be very handy for most sides			2
@entity37 are interested in the 27 - year - old , although @entity39 may opt for a cut - price deal in january rather than wait until the summer			1
@entity33 goalkeeper @entity23 saves a penalty from @entity27 's @entity42 at the @entity29 @entity43 ( @entity44 ) @entity43 has already made it clear that he wo n’t be staying at the @entity46 beyond his current contract and would represent an exciting prospect for almost every side in @entity1			1
a veteran of the @entity51 but still with the vibrancy a full back in @entity54 requires , the @entity35 will have many suitors			0
@entity44 defender @entity43 ( left ) could be on the move at the end of the season as his deal runs down @entity60 ( @entity61 ) he 's mr @entity61 and will almost certainly be offered a new deal by @entity64 but that might not stop clubs trying to speak to @entity60 this month			1
the 34 - year - old has been in excellent form this season - despite his advancing years - and still looks to have a lot left to offer , be it at @entity71 or elsewhere			2
@entity60 is free to talk to clubs outside of @entity54 this month but he appears set to stay at @entity61 @entity73 ( @entity74 ) he says he 'll stay at @entity74 but @entity76 clubs with a space in central defence could do worse than have a chat with @entity80 international @entity73 this month			1
the tenacious 26 - year - old is a regular in @entity83 's defence but might be interested in a fresh start if offered an exciting opportunity elsewhere in @entity1			2
@entity74 defender @entity73 ( right ) tussles with @entity87 striker @entity86 in @entity88 @entity89 ( @entity90 ) @entity89 looks increasingly likely to leave @entity90 this summer as talks over a new deal at @entity93 fail to progress			0
although much maligned for his defensive qualities in recent seasons , the @entity96 man - who can play down the right and left - is still one of the best attacking full backs in the @entity76			0
@entity89 ( centre ) , pictured scoring against @entity103 , is struggling to agree a new contract with @entity90 @entity105 ( @entity106 ) versatile , hard - working and talented with the ball at his feet , @entity105 will have no shortage of suitors if he decides to head for the @entity112 exit door at the end of the current campaign			2
comfortable in central midfield or out wide , the @entity54 man has even had a stint up front recently			0
@entity90 boss @entity118 is an admirer			0
@entity105 , celebrating a goal against @entity121 , will have no shortage of suitors @entity124 ( @entity125 ) @entity126 ( @entity127 ) @entity128 ( @entity129 ) @entity130 ( @entity87 ) @entity131 ( @entity132 ) @entity133 ( @entity134 ) @entity135 ( @entity136 ) @entity137 ( @entity138 ) @entity139 ( @entity140 ) @entity141 ( @entity142 ) @entity143 ( @entity144 ) the real standout player available to clubs who want to get their business done swiftly			1
@entity129 and @entity61 have been interested in the central midfielder and , although his wages will undoubtedly be high , not many would pass up the opportunity to add the @entity152			2
@entity144 's @entity143 ( right ) has attracted interest from @entity76 duo @entity129 and @entity61 @entity155 ( @entity136 ) he has played a key role in @entity136 's revival under @entity158 but @entity155 is yet to sign a new deal to remain part of the @entity162 's plans next season			1
one of the @entity76 's pass masters , the former @entity166 midfielder 's style would be well suited to both @entity168 and @entity80			0
@entity136 and @entity54 @entity155 has plenty of @entity76 experience @entity171 ( @entity172 ) @entity90 failed to sign the winger last january because @entity172 dug their heels in but the @entity176 side must be regretting that now			1
interest is high for the jinking creator and he is certain to leave on a free			0
it ’s a matter of who gets there first			0
@entity90 could make another move for @entity172 's @entity171 after failing with a bid last january @entity185 ( @entity186 ) simply put , the striker can not stop scoring			1
he netted nine ( yes , nine ) goals in the @entity51 group stage , including five away at @entity190			0
he is a late developer and an unknown commodity but had a hand in two goals on his @entity35 debut against @entity196 in november			0
@entity35 striker @entity185 has impressed in the @entity51 this season , scoring nine times so far @entity200 - @entity199 ( @entity125 ) the big @entity201 is enjoying a fine season having scored 12 @entity204 goals to help @entity125 top the table at the halfway stage			1
@entity199 has confirmed he wants to leave at the end of his contract and he quite fancies linking up with @entity83 at @entity74			1
other clubs would be wise to consider him as well			0
@entity211 has confirmed that he will leave @entity125 on a free transfer at the end of the season			0

players who are out of contract this summer can talk to clubs in january
@entity61 's @entity60 and @entity136 's @entity155 make our xi
@entity223 duo @entity143 and @entity43 could both be on the move
