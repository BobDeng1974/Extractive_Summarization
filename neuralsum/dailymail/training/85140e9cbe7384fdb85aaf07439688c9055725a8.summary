by @entity0 published : 04:09 est , 26 february 2014 @entity2 : 10:46 est , 26 february 2014 a man who comfort ate his way to a 50st bulk following his wife 's murder has lost an amazing 30st thanks to a lifesaving gastric bypass			1
@entity15 , 45 , from @entity16 in @entity17 , had become so large , a 25lb lymphedema , a lump caused by a build - up of fluid , had appeared on his leg , putting him in danger of losing it			1
his vast frame also put his marriage to his second wife , @entity23 , under immense strain and left him unable to play with his adopted son , @entity25			1
his re-entry to the jobs market is particularly significant , because at 50st , @entity15 had been confined to the sofa , and suffered from a long list of medical problems			1
speaking on @entity50 show , my 600lb life , which was filmed before his dramatic weight loss kicked in , @entity15 said : ' my weight makes things a lot harder on me , it makes it hard to breathe , it ’s hard for me to stand and get around			1
it ’s hard for me to do normal things ; my weight has handicapped me			2
' i hurt a lot , i have a lymphedema on my leg and right now on a scale of one to 10 , the pain is a nine			2
at 50st and with a huge growth on his leg , @entity15 's movement was restricted and his relationship with his wife and son was suffering ' i ’m tired and exhausted and i just ca n’t keep doing this			1
i ’d rather be a dead man than have to live like this the rest of my life			2
’ @entity15 's weight problems began after he began comfort eating following the tragic murder of his first wife			1
' when i was a kid growing up i did n’t see myself getting really big like i am now , ' he explains			0
' i was a normal sized kid			0
i ’d say it was my thirties when i started putting the weight on gradually			2
‘ my weight got up to 250lbs , then 280lbs and it reached about 300lbs and then my wife was murdered			1
' wiping away tears , he added : she was a good person , my best friend			0
i just could n’t take it so i turned to food			1
' i shut the world out and just locked myself away and ate fast food three times a day			2
i was n’t even thinking about food – i ’d just blank my mind out			2
' @entity15 's weight was so out of control he was willing to risk surgery in a bid to regain his life ‘ for a long time i lost all concept of my weight , and then i went to a scrap metal place to weigh myself			1
i was 698lb ( 50st ) and i could n’t believe it			2
’ despite dealing with his wife ’s murder and his escalating weight , @entity15 managed to find love with his second wife , @entity23			1
having struggled with her own weight , @entity23 , who met @entity15 when he weighed about 600lb , refused to let his excess pounds thwart their relationship			1
‘ he was very shy and he did n’t want to get out of the truck and introduce himself properly because of his size , ' she reveals			0
@entity15 's inability to help his wife @entity23 placed a huge strain on their relationship , as she fulfilled the role of carer , rather than spouse ' i felt like i should give him a chance because i felt all my relationships had failed because of my weight and i did n’t want to judge him for his weight			1
' the pair married not long after meeting and adopted a son , who they named @entity25 , but @entity15 ’s weight impinged on his relationship with his new family			1
‘ he ’s the best thing in the world , ' says @entity15 of his son			1
' i ’d like to go outside and play with @entity25 , but i can hardly walk without getting winded			0
‘ the main thing that really upsets me is putting a lot of strain on my wife			1
i ca n’t do my part of all the things i ’m supposed to do			0
and i want to provide for @entity23 , to give her the life she deserves			2
‘ i think losing weight would make a world of difference ; it would make me a better dad and a better husband			2
' the thought of leaving her behind , of leaving the baby behind hurts			0
i ’m ready to do something about this weight			2
i need to get it off or i ’m going to die			0
’ @entity23 added : ‘ marriage is extremely difficult when you are married to someone who weighs over 600lb			2
' we do n’t have any intimate relationship – our marriage is much more caregiver / patient			1
he eats enough to feed 20 people			0
@entity15 , pictured awaiting his surgery in the specialist hospital with wife @entity23 , had his stomach reduced to just 2.4 ounces during the procedure ‘ i just feel like a servant			1
being a single mum is one thing , but being a single mum when there ’s another human being there is much harder			0
' our family wo n’t last much longer if something does n’t change			0
i want @entity15 to get help			1
i would like for him to have a happy life and have an opportunity to live			2
' sure that weight loss surgery was his only option , @entity15 made the decision to travel to a hospital in @entity180 that specialises in performing weight loss procedures on the morbidly obese			1
speaking ahead of the operation , surgeon dr @entity182 said : ‘ @entity15 has very unhealthy eating habits and if they continue then surgery wo n’t be a good option for him			1
’ at dr @entity182 ’s insistence , @entity15 embarked on a liquid diet to lose 35lb before going under the knife in a bid to make surgery less risky			1
a month after surgery @entity15 lost a further 21lb , which is less than expected after such a drastic procedure although the surgery was a success , @entity15 admits that the first few months after the operation were hard for him to handle			1
‘ i thought the surgery would take away the cravings , but it has n’t been that easy			0
i ’m eating less but i still like good food that tastes good			0
' now that the surgery is over and done with , i know what i can eat and how much i can eat			0
if you ’ve eaten more than you ’re supposed to it will really make you sick			0
’ despite his struggles , a year after the operation , @entity15 says he 's feeling better than ever and says his dramatic weight loss has helped him rethink his life			1
‘ it has been really hard , ' he admits			0
' it is a very scary reality			0
i better wake up and get serious			0
i always thought i was my weight that was the issue , but the reason i put it on was because of thing i had n’t dealt with			2
' i know i have to come to terms with so many of my issues to get my life in order			0
i do n’t know why i get angry like i do			0
i just lash out , and @entity23 does n’t deserve it and i feel so bad when i do			0
@entity15 initially struggled to readjust his diet after surgery , and his recovery and lack of motivation put a great strain on his marriage @entity23 moving out of the house and threatening him with divorce was a turning point for @entity15 , and he began to exercise and stick to his diet @entity15 continued to lose weight , going under the knife for a second time to remove excess skin and his lymphodema , with his dedication encouraging @entity23 to give their marriage another try ' i realised there was a lot of pain i had n’t dealt with and it ’s been eating away at me , creating this anger inside me and driving me to food			1
so many of my issues come from not dealing with the death of my first wife			0
he added : ' my whole life is changed and i feel like a new man			0
i ’m on the road to being a better husband and father			0
' losing the weight has given me a sense of movement , freedom and confidence			0
now i know i can financially provide for my family a year ago i was a walking dead man			0
weight loss surgery has saved my life			1
i know i have a long way to go but i also know i can do it			0
i ’m ready to move forward with my life			0
