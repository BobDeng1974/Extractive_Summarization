the warning was made by @entity2 - based engineer , @entity1 at a recent conference future generations could be exterminated by terminator - style robots unless machines are taught the value of human life			1
this is the stark warning made by @entity2 - based engineer @entity1 , who believes droids could kill humans out of both malice and kindness			1
teaching machines to be kind is not enough , she says , as robots could decide that the greatest compassion to humans as a race is to get rid of everyone to end suffering			1
' the most important work of our lifetime is to ensure that machines are capable of understanding human value , ' she said at the recent ' conference by @entity26 ' in @entity27			1
' it is those values that will ensure machines do n't end up killing us out of kindness			2
' ms @entity1 claims computer chips could soon have the same level of brain power as a bumblebee – allowing them to analyse social situations and their environment			1
' machines are going to be aware of the environments around them and , to a small extent , they 're going to be aware of themselves , ' said ms @entity1 , who is also the chief executive of body scanning firm @entity44			1
' we 're starting to understand the secrets of the human brain , ' she points out , while at the same time we 're getting better at programming computers with deep learning			1
' it 's going to create a huge change in our society @entity54 '			0
for instance , @entity55 is already working on self - driving cars that can automatically sense traffic and adjust their speed and direction			2
mr @entity62 has previously claimed that a horrific ‘ terminator - like ’ scenario could be created from research into artificial intelligence			1
he is so worried , he is investing in @entity67 companies , not to make money , but to keep an eye on the technology in case it gets out of hand			1
a still of the terminator is pictured @entity55 has set up an ethics board to oversee its work in artificial intelligence			0
the search giant has recently bought several robotics companies , along with @entity80 , a @entity82 firm creating software that tries to help computers think like humans			2
one of its founders warned artificial intelligence is ' number 1 risk for this century , ' and believes it could play a part in human extinction ' eventually , i think human extinction will probably occur , and technology will likely play a part in this , ' @entity94 ’s @entity93 said in a recent interview			0
among all forms of technology that could wipe out the human species , he singled out artificial intelligence , or @entity67 , as the ' number 1 risk for this century			1
' the ethics board , revealed by web site @entity106 , is to ensure the projects are not abused			0
neuroscientist @entity108 , 37 , founded @entity94 two years ago with the aim of trying to help computers think like humans			2
meanwhile , @entity112 is leading the way in creating home - help robots for the elderly and injured			1
while ms @entity1 warning seems grim , she believes a robot uprising is n't necessarily a negative event			1
' machines can help us understand ourselves and gather self - knowledge , ' she said			1
' i ca n't help but look at these trends and imagine how then we shall live ? when we start to see super-intelligent artificial intelligence are they going to be friendly or unfriendly ? ' the warning echoes similar comments earlier this month by @entity130 - founder , @entity62 who said artificial intelligence could someday be more harmful than nuclear weapons			1
@entity62 referred to the book ‘ @entity139 , strategies ’ , a work by @entity135 that asks major questions about how humanity will cope with super-intelligent computers			2
mr @entity135 has also argued that the world is fake and we are living in a computer simulation			0
in a later comment , @entity62 wrote : ‘ hope we 're not just the biological boot loader for digital superintelligence			1
unfortunately , that is increasingly probable			0
’ the 42 - year - old is so worried , he is now investing in @entity67 companies , not to make money , but to keep an eye on the technology in case it gets out of hand			1
in march , @entity62 made an investment @entity157 - based @entity67 group @entity155 , along with @entity158 and actor @entity159			1
@entity155 is currently attempting to build a program that mimics the brain ’s neocortex			0
the neocortex is the top layer of the cerebral hemispheres in the brain of mammals			0
it is around 3mm thick and has six layers , each involved with various functions			0
these include sensory perception , spatial reasoning , conscious thought , and language in humans			0
according to the company ’s website : ‘ @entity155 is developing machine learning software based on the computational principles of the human brain			2
the warning echoes similar comments tweeted earlier this month by @entity186 founder , @entity62 who said artificial intelligence could someday be more harmful than nuclear weapons high flier : @entity62 ( pictured ) is setting his sights on satellites and wants to use them to get remote parts of the world online			1
the billionaire entrepreneur is now exploring ways to create small and cheap satellites in a project that would pit him against @entity55 and @entity200 ‘ our first technology is a visual perception system that interprets the contents of photographs and videos in a manner similar to humans			2
‘ powering this technology is a new computational paradigm we call the @entity211			0
’ in october 2013 , the company announced it had developed an algorithm that ‘ reliably ’ solves modern @entity214 - the world ’s most widely used test of a machine ’s ability to act human			0
captchas are used when filling in forms , for example , to make sure it ’s not being completed by a bot			0
this prevents people programming computers to buy a bulk load of gig tickets , for example			0
professor @entity231 has also warned that humanity faces an uncertain future as technology learns to think for itself and adapt to its environment			0
earlier this year , the renowned physicist discussed @entity240 's film @entity238 , which delves into a world where computers can surpass the abilities of humans			2
professor @entity231 said dismissing the film as science fiction could be the ‘ worst mistake in history ’			0
@entity231 has warned that artificial intelligence has the potential to be the downfall of mankind			0
' success in creating @entity67 would be the biggest event in human history , ' he said writing in the @entity257			2
' unfortunately , it might also be the last '			0

the warning was made by @entity2 - based engineer , @entity1
*speaking* at a conference in @entity27 , she said robots could decide that the greatest compassion to humans as a race is to get rid of everyone
ms @entity1 said computer chips could soon have the same level of brain power as a bumblebee – allowing them to analyse social situations
' machines are going to be aware of the environments around them and , to a small extent , they 're going to be aware of themselves , ' she said
her comments follow tweets by @entity130 - founder , @entity62 , earlier this month who said @entity67 could be more *dangerous* than nuclear weapons
