thousands of strays , of both the homeless canine and working feline variety , were rounded up and cleared off the streets of @entity4 as part of the @entity6 clean up			0
there must have been at least a couple of four - legged survivors			0
because @entity10 have made two dog ’s dinners of @entity13 2014			1
one on the pitch , the other off it			0
@entity18 's dinner : @entity19 guided @entity10 to an early exit after losing their opening two games to end up playing a match which was surplus to little @entity25 ’s requirements – but a dead - dog rubber for @entity10 - before slinking back home is more humiliating than it has ever been for football ’s mother country			1
to inflict a goalless draw of such numbing indifference on so brilliant a @entity34 carnival was tantamount to an act of vandalism			1
but not as wretched as to indulge in self - aggrandising , show - boat insulting of @entity39 and its president in public , which was not only embarrassing but moronic			0
whatever @entity19 and his team got wrong in what turned out to be not so much a group of slow death as one of rapid suicide , those deficiencies pale in comparison with the damage self - inflicted on our national game by chairman @entity52 and his @entity54 gang of fools			1
there are times when @entity19 is too open and honest for his own good – although bless him for that – but when it comes to putting boot in mouth @entity52 is in a class all his own			1
debacle : @entity10 are heading home early from the @entity34 after losing to @entity66 and @entity67 @entity19 is endlessly courteous and charming when trying to explain the thinking behind decisions for which he is criticised			1
it probably was n’t a great idea to declare , after the debacle in @entity13 , that he will need six more years to get @entity10 up to @entity34 speed			1
even @entity75 presidents only ask for four more			0
but he is telling it as he sees it , not for effect nor to excuse in advance what may well go wrong in the next couple of tournaments			0
@entity10 ’s manager is simply trying to focus the @entity54 and the @entity85 on the scale of the task and the revolution which needs to take place			1
since @entity90 are voyages of discovery , @entity19 is speaking from what he has learned here			1
it was a mistake to bring too many young players			0
albeit one made in the desperate knowledge that the long - established members of the squad had failed too often , losing the faith of the @entity101 public while doing so			0
mistakes : @entity19 will have to go back to the drawing board ahead of the @entity105 qualifiers two or three boys of exceptional promise – @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 – were enough			1
tactically there was an old - fashioned look about @entity10			1
the world game evolves constantly and we saw little or nothing from @entity116 of the dynamic pressing and quick , clever angled passing made possible by sharp movement which are fundamental to the best teams in this competition			0
that is by no means all the fault of this manager			0
the @entity85 is more about box - office thrills and spills than technique and intelligence , while not enough @entity101 players are benefitting from the experience of the @entity131			0
even so @entity19 will shoulder his share of the blame for a showing even more dismal than @entity10 ’s only previous failure to qualify from the group stage			1
promising signs : @entity109 was one a few @entity10 players to make an impression so must the likes of @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147			1
at least in 1958 @entity10 forced three draws and returned home undefeated			2
two strikes and out before this mostly meaningless exercise in @entity151 of giving the back - up chaps consolation @entity34 caps is nothing less than humiliation			2
frankly , it is no wonder that the folks back home wonder how some of these players can be paid so much yet do so little for the country			0
the wretchedness of their efforts has become clearer with a realisation that @entity66 and @entity67 are no better than average teams			0
shouldering the blame : the likes of @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144 must take responsibility yes , part of the answer lies in improving the identifying of the best young talent and educating those boys properly in the finer arts of football			0
this is the primary responsibility of the @entity54			0
@entity52 pays lip service to that duty , while just grandstanding on the world stage			2
@entity10 were like a dog chasings its own tail			2
even worse , the @entity54 were barking up all the wrong trees			0
@entity52 should have been campaigning for the introduction of international regulations which would force the self - interested @entity85 to limit the number of foreigners at our major clubs and thereby develop world class footballers of @entity101 birth - right			2
he should have been working quietly behind the scenes to heal the rift between @entity10 and the governing body of the world game so that we might rebuild the respect and influence we once had and , hopefully , bring football home again			2
@entity18 's dinner : @entity52 's tenure has been nothing sure of a disaster so far but oh no. not our mr @entity52			1
up he jumped in front of the whole congress to demand the head of @entity207 over a corruption issue for which he is not culpable - and even as he is presiding over a magical @entity34 which will generate billions for the game around the world			1
there is as much chance of @entity207 not being re-elected next year as there ever was of @entity10 winning this @entity34			1
it ’s all in the timing			0
this is embarrassingly reminiscent of previous @entity54 bigwigs promising to vote for a @entity219 candidate against @entity207 when he was first elected , then hastily switching when they realised which way the wind was blowing			2
@entity52 fancied he could position himself as the champion of an @entity224 movement			2
seemingly he fails to understand that it was this president who expelled @entity227 , the @entity228 accused of @entity230 hosting corruption			0
attack : @entity52 hit out at @entity207 on the eve of the tournament nor does he grasp that any hostility to @entity207 in most of the rest of the world is nothing like as fierce as in insular @entity10 and that he has antagonised not only the @entity39 high command but many other countries			1
if it really is @entity101 football ’s ambition never to win or stage the @entity34 again , then the @entity54 have gone a long way towards achieving those goals .			2

@entity10 humiliated by early exit at the @entity34
@entity19 made mistakes but not as many as @entity52
@entity52 demanded @entity207 's *resignation* over a corruption issue for which he is not culpable
