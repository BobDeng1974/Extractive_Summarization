for miners working during the @entity3 regime , it was not an ideal commute			2
after an 18 hour shift , they would file into these tiny ' metal coffins ' dangling over the steep slopes and gorges surrounding the town of @entity11 in @entity12			1
but despite its rusty and ageing appearance , the 1950 's transport system still takes workers in and out of the valley every day , and is one of the most incredible engineering spectacles in the world			1
@entity3 authorities were intent on extracting vast amounts of manganese , which was discovered in abundance in the area at the turn of the 20th century , when the area was a @entity44 stronghold			1
in 1905 , a functioning workers ' town was built to extract these vast deposits , and it needed a transport system fit for purpose			1
for 50 years , @entity3 planners struggled to find a way to navigate around the extremes of the town , so they decided the best solution would be aerial			2
in an effort to conquer the town 's extreme geography , a network of tramways were built so almost every corner of the mining town was accessible			1
the system transported workers from their homes at the bottom of the gorge to the mines that dotted the mountains			2
it was also used to transport the manganese to the various factories in the area			0
crumbling : a cabin exits of @entity11 's central station which shows signs of ageing both inside and out fear : a man appears to be praying as he boards the rust - ridden cable car on the journey down the valley still running : @entity81 , from @entity11 , rides the tramway which continues to transport residents despite its rusty appearance history : a photo of the tramway just after it had been built in the 1950s			1
the @entity3 authorities wanted a transport system which could efficiently transport workers to the mine at the bottom of the valley and to this day , it is still fully operational , serving a manganese production plant which is open 24 hours a day			1
in its heyday @entity11 was responsible for producing 60 per cent of the world 's manganese			0
the chemical element , which was harvested in the region , was used for treating rust and corrosion on steel , which meant it was essential for building armaments and tanks			0
the town is situated in a mountain valley on the banks of the @entity111 , and since 1879 has been a major centre of manganese production in the @entity114			0
during the @entity115 , @entity11 was the only @entity44 stronghold in a @entity117 dominated @entity12			1
almost 4,000 miners worked 18 hours to maximise the levels of production , with some even sleeping where they dug			0
@entity122 began his personal affiliation with the town when he persuaded the workers to back @entity126 during a debate with the @entity117			0
the workers were fond of him and called him ' sergeant major @entity122 ' after he successfully set up a printing press , protection racket and ' red battle squads '			0
today , while some of the cars have rusted away , seventeen - including the @entity3 's first passenger tramway - remain in service			1
most tramways in @entity11 use a ' jig back ' system where two cabins are connected to the same haulage rope			2
an electric motor pulls one cabin down , using that cabin 's weight to help pull the other cabin up			0
the tramway has remained despite a volatile history of problems in @entity12			2
the unique transport system was installed in an effort to conquer the town 's extreme geography			1
a cable car now runs to almost every corner of the mining town comparison : one of the tramway stations in 1960 , left , and the present day			0
@entity159 has changed aside from the advertising on the side of the cable car forest : the tramway skims over trees during one of its many journeys across the valley drop : because of the steep slopes of the valley , the cable cars have to negotiate some precarious drops as they transport residents around the extremes of @entity11 driver : a man operates the cable car system as he tucks into a bowl of apples			1
the array of buttons and dials have survived since the 1960s when the system was installed in 1990 , there was a crash in @entity186 , the capital of @entity12 , which resulted in at least 20 deaths and 15 injuries			1
the accident involved two gondolas on a ropeway route between @entity192 and @entity193			0
the cable car was on its way down from the slope of the mount near the @entity198			0
when the hauling rope broke the lower gondola rolled back and slammed onto the wall of the station injuring people inside , while the upper gondola rolled at high speeds and dropped 20 metres as the breaks did not work			0
standing at the platform : a man waits for a cable car to carry him across the gorge			0
the wheels which operate the system look brown and rusted view : a cabin from @entity215 travels over the strong currents of the @entity111			0
this would have been a daily spectacle for miners during the @entity3 era signs of ageing : a discarded piece of track cable has been frayed and left rusted by almost 60 years of constant use art : a socialist realist painting hanging on the inside of a building in @entity11 celebrates the manganese miners of the town @entity3 remnants : a cold war poster proclaiming ' peace ' in @entity236 and @entity237 script hangs in the town a women meets a fellow passenger in one of the many tramway stations surrounding the town			1
unlike the coffee shops and newsagents of today 's modern train stations , the facilities were very limited break : two miners stop to smoke in a manganese mine above @entity11			2

tramway in @entity11 , @entity12 was built by @entity3 authorities in the 1950s so they could transport workers
the unique system was installed because of the extreme geography of the area , including steep valley slopes , river crossings and gorges
it is still operational today even though some cars having rusted away and and some stations have gone into *disrepair*
