by @entity0 follow @ @ neilashton _ @entity2 's claims are just sinking in with @entity3 when he starts rattling off the names of some @entity6 captains down the years			1
‘ there ’s been me , @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 ... that ’s a lot of big names with a lot of big egos , ’ declared @entity3			2
‘ @entity20 ’s a clever , articulate man and he ’s a friend of mine but he would n’t have been @entity6 captain for 10 years — nobody is			1
main man : @entity3 played 53 times for his country , scoring twice , and was @entity6 's first black captain new dawn : @entity3 was made @entity6 's first black captain in 1993 , and went on to skipper the side seven times ‘ he has obviously had different experiences to me as a footballer and i can only really talk about my own			1
’ @entity3 knows what it takes to lead the country : a fiery , competitive warrior who was first named @entity6 captain in 1993 against the @entity40 in @entity41 , @entity42			1
he was the first black @entity6 player to wear the armband and yet @entity3 has mixed views about the stir it caused			1
‘ for me it was the pinnacle of my career when @entity49 made me captain , but i can remember feeling uncomfortable with the questions			2
maestro : former @entity53 and @entity54 midfielder @entity3 earned 53 @entity6 caps , scoring twice big names , big egos : @entity3 ( left ) believes the likes of @entity9 ( right ) were made captain because of character rare : @entity2 was captain for three friendly games in 1998 and 2005 but never received it long term ‘ i just wanted to be the @entity6 captain , i did n’t want to be remembered as the first black @entity6 captain because i did n’t look at it in that way			1
@entity69 21 ‘ then , after the game , i began to look at it in a different way because i had a lot of parents from the ghetto sending me letters telling me it had inspired their children to get jobs or to start playing football			0
‘ i do n’t know whether they were black , white or @entity82 or whatever , but it did n’t matter			2
that meant a lot , to think that somehow i had inspired people i had never even met			0
’ @entity2 has made some startling claims , chief among them the idea that the game ’s governing body in this country is institutionally racist			1
the former @entity6 defender , who was named captain three times during a distinguished international career , has convinced himself that his colour prevented him leading his country more often			1
trusted : @entity3 was made captain for @entity6 's crucial @entity101 qualifier in @entity102 against @entity103 by @entity104 wearing the armband : @entity12 ( left ) barks instructions as @entity11 ( right ) celebrates scoring ‘ we can make too much of the captaincy and what it means , ’ added @entity3			1
‘ i was captain of pretty much every team i played for — @entity54 , @entity112 , @entity53 , @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity6 — so my colour did n’t come into it			1
‘ @entity20 is a friend of mine and he was around for @entity119 under @entity120 and again at the @entity101 in 1998			0
‘ i did n’t deal with the @entity121 often enough , but there was never any issue over my skin colour with my team - mates or people i came across within the organisation			1
‘ i have no reason to believe they are racist — who are we talking about ? i loved people like @entity133 ( former executive director at the @entity121 ) and i just never encountered it			2
‘ @entity20 has every right to his view and we all have opinions , but in my experience i just did n’t see it			0
i was an @entity6 player , an @entity6 captain , i did n’t think about it			1
’ friends : @entity2 with former @entity6 captain @entity11 , who skippered his nation on 34 occasions skipper : @entity2 with fellow centre - back @entity8 , who captained @entity6 15 times @entity3 captained @entity6 seven times , famously leading the country to the @entity101 finals in 1998 in a blood - stained shirt after a typically combative performance alongside @entity151 against @entity103 in @entity102			1
‘ @entity8 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity20 all played in that game and i had a responsibility to wear the armband against a very good @entity103 team			0
‘ i can remember the night before the @entity103 game			0
i was with @entity153 and we were both so nervous that we could n’t sleep because we did n’t want to let the country down the next night			0
‘ i felt a responsibility to the country , but the captaincy would have meant nothing to me if i did n’t have the respect of the other players			2
that was important to me			0
‘ my @entity6 team - mates did n’t look at me and think , “ @entity3 is a black @entity6 captain ” , and neither did the manager			1
why is that an issue ? leading the pack : @entity13 ( front centre ) is the only black player to be @entity6 's official leading captain influential : the former @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 defender won 73 caps with @entity6 ‘ @entity104 was the manager and he chose the person he felt could do the job the best at that particular time — he could pick who he wanted			1
@entity104 was the manager and should have been for a lot longer			0
he chose the captain , as @entity49 and @entity120 did before him and the @entity121 never had any say in it			2
’ @entity3 ... 7 ( inc 6 friendlies ) @entity2 ... 3 ( 3 ) @entity13 ... 7 ( 4 ) @entity185 ... 1 ( 1 ) @entity186 ... 18 ( 14 ) @entity3 represented his country 53 times and retired from international football after @entity6 ’s @entity191 exit			1
he went on to become a manager with @entity193 , @entity194 and , most recently , @entity195 but fears that a number of top , former black @entity6 players are being lost to the game			2
@entity3 , now 47 , added : ‘ we have lost a lot of good black players out of the game , such as @entity20 , @entity153 , @entity203			2
‘ we have to give them inspiration to stay involved because this is the 21st century			0
i was 32 when i started thinking about what was next for me			0
back then : @entity2 celebrates scoring against @entity207 in the 2002 @entity101 finally : @entity208 left - back @entity185 captains @entity6 against @entity209 in may after earning 100 caps ‘ i understand there are obstacles in the way because we have to be prepared to do our a licence and our @entity216 if we want to be managers			2
‘ i have had five jobs now and i think i have done well at all of them and still think i should be manager of @entity195			0
‘ it would have been easy to sit on my a * * e for five years and wait but i did n’t want to do that			0
i wanted to prove i could do it and i have done that at clubs with limited resources			0
‘ people like @entity227 , @entity228 , did so much for the game and showed black players that they could go on to become managers			0
‘ last year there was a lot of talk about the @entity235 , giving an ethnic minority candidate the opportunity to make a case for a job			0
we jumped on that and then it ’s all gone away			0
‘ maybe @entity20 needs to decide what he wants to do with his career now that he has stopped playing and commit to whatever it is he wants to do			0
’ pioneer for the game : @entity3 notes how @entity227 opened up doors when he was made the @entity250 's first full - time black manager in the summer of 1993 when appointed @entity252 boss claim : @entity2 argues he was ignored for the @entity6 captaincy because of the colour of his skin sensitive issue : @entity2 's claim has ignited many opinions from the world of football			1

@entity3 was the first black player to captain @entity6 in 1993 against @entity40
@entity3 : ‘ we can make too much of the captaincy and what it means '
the @entity121 never had a say in who was @entity6 captain , *insists* @entity3
@entity2 , who led @entity6 three times , says @entity121 is ' institutionally racist '
@entity2 : ' if i was white i would have been @entity6 captain for 10 years '
but @entity3 says no one could hold the @entity6 captaincy for a decade
@entity3 , captain seven times , says the colour of his skin never came into it
