by : @entity0 published : 11:01 est , 20 september 2012 updated : 01:44 est , 21 september 2012 a rare bone cribbage board played on by @entity2 as he sailed to fight at @entity3 has been discovered after lying in a dusty drawer for more than 70 years			1
the item had lain at the back of the jammed drawer until it was found by auctioneer @entity8 in a @entity11 desk worth just £ 30			2
mr @entity8 had been given the desk to sell as part of the clearance from a small @entity16 museum			1
discovery : the rare bone cribbage board had been hidden in a dusty drawer for more than 70 years entertainment : admiral @entity2 kept himself busy by playing the game as he sailed to fight at @entity3			1
despite its low value mr @entity8 decided to smarten up the lot for auction and ensure the desk was in working condition which meant he had to battle with one particularly stubborn drawer			1
having eased it open mr @entity8 was amazed to discover a tiny bone cribbage scoring board with an inscription on the back			1
@entity2 had to keep himself amused at sea on the reverse there was a handwritten label dated around 1940s in appearance stating the name of the donor as @entity42			2
handwritten in ink next to that label were the words : ' the cribbage board used by @entity46 & admiral @entity47 ' admiral @entity47 rose quickly through the ranks before he was hand - picked by @entity2 to serve under him as a first lieutenant on the famous @entity51			1
during the @entity3 he bravely steered the @entity52 into action on october 21 , 1805			0
an extract from @entity56 ’s @entity55 reads : ' just as she ( the @entity52 ) had got about 500 yards of the larboard beam of the @entity59 the @entity52 ’s mizzen - topmast was shot away , about two - thirds up			0
' a shot also struck and knocked to pieces the wheel ; and the ship was obliged to be steered from the gun room , the first lieutenant ( @entity47 ) and master ( @entity68 ) relieving each other at the duty			1
' mr @entity8 , from @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , said what could have been just the sale of a £ 30 desk could now be worth thousands			1
a similar cribbage board with no connection to @entity2 would be expected to fetch £ 400 - £ 600 , but the last item of @entity2 memorabilia - a quill pen and handwritten letter went for £ 8,500			1
delicate : the rare bone cribbage board withstood the rough seas and has been out of action for 70 years @entity3 : the @entity87 fleet lost twenty - two ships , without a single @entity90 vessel being lost			1
he said : “ at first we thought this was too good to be true , but after further investigation we discovered papers in the @entity96 relating to the donor ’s name @entity99			0
' his name had been applied to the piece by a museum back in the 1950s and had himself been a direct descendant of admiral @entity47			1
' upon the donor ’s death his family had indeed donated items to the district in which the bureau had originated and from where it came to us			0
' the last curator of the museum was as far as we know the first to properly catalogue the items in their possession around the late1980s			0
bargain : the @entity11 desk in which @entity8 found the cribbage game was worth just £ 30 blast from the past : on the reverse there was a handwritten label dated around 1940s in appearance ' the last curator of the museum was as far as we know the first to properly catalogue the items in their possession around the late1980s lucky find : auctioneer @entity8 only wanted to fix the desk ' it ’s not surprising that this unique object was missed whilst cataloguing the items more recently especially as no recent staff could have had any idea that such a thing was hiding in their possession for all these years			1
' in cribbage players put pins in holes on the scoreboard until a target number of points is reached , typically 61 or 121			2
points are scored for card combinations that add up to fifteen , and for pairs , triples , quadruples , runs , and flushes			0
mr @entity8 said that at first he thought the cribbage board was just a piece of wood lodged in the drawer			1
he said : ' i managed to open all parts of the desk but one drawer with relative ease but could only force the last drawer to open slightly			2
' i could see by torch light through a crack that there was something like a piece of wood jammed			0
' such items often have thin wood stationary dividers within them so i immediately thought it was such a piece which had become dislodged			0
' with a little brute force and a screw driver together with 20 minutes or so jiggling i eventually managed to prize the drawer open			0
' @entity2 ’s and @entity47 ’s cribbage board will be sold at auction with some 800 other items from the same museum on october 20 and 21			1
@entity180 cashing in : a similar , unconnected cribbage board would fetch £ 400 - £ 600 but this could go for a lot more cribbage is thought to have been created by the @entity16 poet sir @entity185 in the early 17th century , as a derivation of the game " noddy "			1
updated : today 's cribbage boards tend to be made of wood while noddy has disappeared , cribbage has survived , virtually unchanged			2
cribbage in @entity16 is primarily a pub game and is one of the few games allowed by @entity197 to be played in a public house for small stakes			2
also know as ' crib ' , it is a card game traditionally for two players , that involves playing and grouping cards in combinations which gain points			0
a board , such as that used by @entity2 , is used on which to keep score			2
although @entity2 's board was made of bone , today they are more commonly made on wood			0
the objective of the game is to be the first player to score a target number of points , typically 61 or 121			0
points are scored for card combinations that add up to fifteen , and for pairs , triples , quadruples , runs , and flushes			0
players choose the order in which to lay their cards in order to maximize their score ; experienced players refer to this as either good or poor ' pegsmanship '			0
if one player reaches the target ( usually 61 or 121 ) , the game ends immediately and that player wins			0
to reach that point is known as ' to peg out ' , which was origin of the same phrase meaning to die .			0

@entity239 wanted to get the desk in working order so he could sell it on
a handwritten note reveals that it is ' the cribbage board used by @entity46 & admiral @entity47 '
the board will now be auctioned , *potentially* fetching several thousands
