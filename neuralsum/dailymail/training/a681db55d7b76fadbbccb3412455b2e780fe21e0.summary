by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 21:02 est , 7 may 2013 updated : 07:31 est , 8 may 2013 @entity2 is said to have risked it all on a new operating system for @entity5 , a gamble that may have cost the company 's ceo dearly			1
in the face @entity9 and @entity11 's success in the mobile and tablet computer market , @entity5 bet the farm when it introduced @entity16 8 , the operating system that @entity2 had heralded as the future			1
debuting last year , @entity19 was the nervous system of its new line of surface tablet and smartphones			2
betting it all : @entity5 ceo @entity2 made a big gamble when he introduced @entity16 8 in october it was no secret that @entity2 was making a huge bet			1
when he introduced the operating system in october , a screen behind him read : ' @entity16 : all in			1
' but the gamble does not appear to have paid off , as @entity5 8 received less - than - stellar reviews and failed to measure up to the hype and sales of @entity9 and @entity37 devices			1
critics , as well as some consumers , lambasted the technology giant over @entity19 , mentioning the confusing array of touchscreen tiles and lack of @entity5 's trademark ' @entity46 ' button			1
some have now called for @entity2 to quit or be fired			2
@entity48 , a former @entity5 executive who oversaw the building of the @entity16 brand , told the @entity51 last month that he believes @entity2 ' does n't have the vision ' to be ceo			1
any decision to oust @entity2 would have to come from his predecessor @entity54 , who holds the largest stake in the company and personally selected @entity2 - his friend - to take over			0
on the chopping block ? @entity2 's overhaul of the @entity16 operating system has led to some calls for him to be ousted decision : any move to fire @entity2 would have to come from his predecessor @entity54 , who holds the majority stock in the company and personally selected @entity2 to take over while @entity5 has experienced growth in recent years , any success is eclipsed by @entity9 , which unveiled the @entity67 at about the same time as @entity19			1
some reviewers liked the way @entity19 greets users with a mosaic of tiles displaying applications instead of relying on the desktop icons that served as the welcome mat for years			0
but others say it 's a confusing jumble that will frustrate users accustomed to the older versions , particularly when they switch to desktop mode and do n't see the familiar ' start ' button and menu			0
struck by the flurry of complaints , @entity5 is giving @entity16 8 a makeover , known as @entity86			1
overshadowed : @entity5 's success has been eclipsed by @entity9 's tablets and smart phones , as well as other devices powered by @entity37 @entity91 , who serves as the marketing and financial chief for @entity5 's @entity16 business , announced a retreat , admitting that the software had defeated many users			1
she said ; ' the learning curve is definitely real and we need to address it			0
' the company , which is based in @entity102 , @entity103 , says more than 100 million @entity16 8 licenses have been sold so far , up from about 60 million licenses in january			0
the licensing volume ' is in the same general ballpark , ' as @entity5 's previous operating system - @entity108 - at a similar juncture of its sales cycle , according to ms @entity91			1
in an interview , ms @entity91 said @entity5 still realized changes need to be made to make @entity16 8 easier to navigate and capable of taking full advantage of technology improvements that have come out since october			0
ms @entity91 said : ' are there things that we can do to improve the experience ? absolutely			0
there is a learning curve [ to @entity19 ] and we can work to address that			0
' @entity86 also might make it easier to find a set of controls - known as ' charms ' in @entity19 's parlance - that currently must be pulled out from the right side of a display screen			1
besides responding to customer feedback , @entity86 also will make @entity16 8 better suited for smaller , less expensive tablets with 7 - and 8 - inch display screens , ms @entity91 said			0
the tune - up announced on tuesday wo n't be released to consumers and businesses until later this year			0
one leading research firm , @entity136 , says @entity19 contributed to a 14 per cent decline in worldwide pc sales during the first three months of the year - the biggest year - over - year drop ever			0
meanwhile , sales of smartphones and tablet computers are booming			0
the biggest beneficiaries have been @entity9 , the maker of the @entity145 and @entity67 , and @entity11 , which sells the most devices running on @entity37 's @entity148 software			1
changes : @entity5 has now announced an overhaul to @entity19 , which has been dubbed ' @entity86 ' @entity37 is also benefiting from @entity148 's popularity through increased traffic to its services , creating more opportunities for the company to display ads. by contrast , leading pc makers such as @entity158 and @entity159 , which primarily sell @entity16 - powered machines , have been mired in a financial funk that has battered their stocks and raised questions about their futures			1
for now , @entity5 is n't saying what kind of changes will be introduced with the release of @entity86 , which the company plans to anoint with a different name when the update is available			1
@entity5 also is n't saying whether it will charge existing owners of @entity19 devices to get the fixes in @entity86			1
the company plans to release @entity86 in time for the holiday season			0
ms @entity91 said more details about @entity86 will be released before @entity5 holds a developers conference in @entity179 in late june			2
success : the biggest beneficiaries in the tablet and smartphone boom have been @entity9 , the maker of the @entity145 and @entity67 , and @entity11 , which sells the most devices running on @entity37 's @entity148 software some of @entity86 's features are expected to be previewed at that conference			1
' i view this as a relaunch of @entity19 , finally giving everyone a fully baked version , ' said technology analyst @entity194			2
' it has been a very rough road for @entity5 so far			0
' if @entity86 is meant to make people more comfortable , the changes may incorporate more of the elements from earlier versions of @entity16			0
but one thing that @entity86 wo n't fix : the relatively small selection of mobile applications tailored for @entity19			2
ms @entity91 said the windows 8 store now has more than 60,000 apps			0
by contrast , there are more than 800,000 apps available for @entity9 's mobile 's devices and nearly that many for @entity148 devices , too			2
in one of the most glaring omissions on @entity19 , @entity211 still has n't designed an app to make its online social network more accessible on that system			2
@entity211 has about 750 million mobile users			0
@entity5 's decision to tweak @entity16 8 so soon after its much - ballyhooed release may reinforce perceptions that the product is the company 's biggest flop since the @entity224 - the company 's answer to the @entity227			2
investors still believe @entity19 will pay off for @entity5 , which gets more than half of its revenue from the sale of @entity16 operating systems and various software programs and services			1
the company 's stock slipped 40 cents to $ 33.35 in tuesday 's afternoon trading , leaving the shares with a 20 per cent gain since @entity19 went on sale			2
that outstrips the 15 per cent increase in the @entity243 during the same stretch .			0

@entity5 ceo said to have bet it all on @entity19 , which has received poor reviews and is bested by @entity9 and @entity37 products
some have called for @entity2 's ouster
