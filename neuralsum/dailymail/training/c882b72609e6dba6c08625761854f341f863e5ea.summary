' the @entity3 show @entity6 : on the pull - which claimed to teach awkward men how to talk to women - finished its first series on november 3 face - off : @entity12 was grilled by the @entity21 's @entity149 as he revealed he is retiring his ' character ' @entity149 : @entity153 , at best what you do is offensive , at worst it incites harassment and violence			1
@entity157 : @entity158 , d'you know what , from the beginning when i started the character @entity6 it caught on really quick that that type of humour was really popular for a certain demographic of people ... in the end it became really popular and i kind of got a little bit carried away with it to be honest with you			1
@entity173 : when you see that now , what do you think ? @entity178 : if that was the first time i 'd seen that kind of comedy i 'd think the character is not setting a good example , but at the time when we were doing it , it was getting so much praise from the audience it was being received by and growing and growing and growing ... i thought maybe y'know these people could see that i 'm , cos , saying that , obviously to me , it 's like c'mon , that 's not , that 's not real , obviously i do n't think that , but i , i 'm taking the mick out of what i thought men think , d'you what i mean ? @entity173 : right			1
so when you say you 're giving advice to men on the pull and for example you say ' get your g * * * out ' to women , can you deny that would encourage men to do that on the street ? @entity178 : yeah potentially of course , you 're right , it 's , it 's , y'know , it 's wrong , but , to , well i 'm not going to say but , but to me , i did n't see it as me that was saying that , i was creating this character and i was really pushing the boundaries with this character because it was quite popular			2
@entity173 : so you agree that when you create this character and it incites sexual violence ... @entity178 : i did n't think it did at the time , i thought the people that were viewing it were saying this is ridiculous and laughing at it			0
@entity173 : you 've said @entity6 is an extension of yourself			2
he allows you to do things you would n't normally do and you blame it on him			0
does n't sound like satire at all , it sounds like an excuse			0
@entity178 : well that 's not the attitude that i did have with it			0
d'you know what , to be completely honest with you , it was great at the beginning for me , it 's completely ruined everything that 's going on with me as a comedian			2
@entity173 : just another line that came up , ' just show her your penis , if she cries she 's playing hard to get '			2
there 's a bit in the film we saw where you 're holding up a knife and you say ' lift up your f * * * * * * shirt			0
was that all just done in jest ? @entity178 : no disrespect to you , looking at me now , do you think i 'd go out and do that ? i was creating , i was pushing the boundaries of that character			0
@entity173 : but what you 're saying is that women who say no do n't mean no , and if people watching that think it 's funny and they go and enact that , then that 's the consequence ... @entity178 : that makes me sad to think if someone had done that and i was responsible for that it 's terrible			2
that 's why this week with the bad press and everything that 's happened , i 've stopped and said , y'know , it 's wrecked my life to a certain extent			1
@entity173 : so you 're feeling like a bit of a victim now , are you ? @entity178 : i would n't say that , maybe a victim of my own mistakes .			0
