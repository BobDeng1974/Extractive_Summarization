for many dads out there , they dream of their son making it as a professional footballer			0
but while this has its undoubted challenges , getting your child to support the same football team is surely a must			0
in this hilarious video , a young father perches his son on his knee , and begins a chant in honour of his favourite team - @entity19			1
after a reluctant start , 10 - month - old @entity20 soon throws himself into his father 's @entity19 chant the toddler is well trained it seems , and almost as if he is on the terraces himself , he joins in with the actions football fans everywhere will recognise			1
the father shouts out ' @entity19 , ' in reference to the @entity32 club who play their football in @entity35			1
at this point 10 - month old @entity20 raises his hands in the air			1
' come on you boys in red , ' continues the father , which is met by the blonde - haired child clapping his hands together			0
the actions are met with a wide smile and attempts at copying his father 's chants			0

ten - month - old @entity20 looks well set to be a @entity19 fan
shows off actions every football fan will recognise as father chants
even tries to copy the *vocals* , but *plenty* of time to *perfect* that
