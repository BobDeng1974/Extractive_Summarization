a ten - year - old boy with a giant tumour on his neck could be cured after being prescribed viagra			1
@entity4 , of @entity5 , @entity6 , was losing time as the life - threatening growth could stop him breathing by putting pressure on his windpipe , with surgeons desperate to operate			1
but it will not be safe until the cystic growth , known as a lymphangioma , is smaller			1
@entity3 , which is most famous for helping male impotence , has been discovered to shrink growths in children			1
he said : ‘ if the doctors can cure me i will be so happy			2
i would be healthy and i 'd be able to do anything i want			2
i could run fast , play on the swings and rings - anything i want			1
’ the growth is rough and scaly and often forms painful cysts			1
it extends across @entity4 's shoulder and restricts his movement			1
he can not swim because the water causes him pain and he gets tired easily if playing football and riding his bike			2
and now some of the cysts are invading his lungs and approaching his windpipe			2
there are also fears it could one day spread to his eyes and affect his vision			2
‘ it 's been difficult , ’ his mother @entity47 explained			1
‘ people stare at him			0
some of them have these terrible , morbid looks on their faces			0
smiles : @entity4 , ten , with his mother @entity47 , and father @entity55 it was only last year that his parents even found out what was causing the growth their son has had since he was a baby ‘ we 've tried to let @entity4 lead as normal a life as possible			1
we let him do everything the other children do , unless it 's unsafe for him or will be too difficult			1
‘ but sometimes he gets so sad because he is different from other kids			0
until now there was simply no money to treat him			0
’ ' if the doctors can cure me i will be so happy			0
i would be healthy and i 'd be able to do anything i want ' @entity4 another stumbling block for @entity4 's family has been the cost			1
the treatment and surgery to remove the growth will cost a staggering £ 125,000 ( $ 200,000 )			1
and then there 's the cost of the medication - £ 1,250 ( $ 2,000 ) per week , which @entity4 has needed to be prescribed for several months			1
but the family have been given funding to cover the price			0
‘ that is unbelievable amount of money for us , ’ his mother said			0
‘ more money than we 'd see in a lifetime			0
words can express how grateful we are to the people who have helped us			0
it feels like a dream come true			0

help : the cost of @entity4 's ongoing care is being funded with help from a hospital , fundraisers from a church and donations from around the world ‘ when @entity4 was born with the growth we were terrified for him , ’ she recalled			1
‘ the doctors told me it was very likely the baby would n't even survive the night			0
‘ i felt bad because we did n't have the financial resources to get him the help he needed			0
’ mr @entity114 added : ‘ the little ball he had as a baby has grown and now it 's spreading to the sides			2
it seems to be filling up more			0
the first year was difficult because we did n't know what could happen and if we could hurt him			0
‘ the lump was as big as his head , so it was difficult to hold him			0
because they said he would n't survive , i get a sense of pride to still have him			0
’ @entity146 said , beaming : ‘ now i have much more hope			0
i just want to be able to play and have fun			0
’ the emotional scenes are captured in new @entity153 @entity152 series @entity150			1

‘ my husband and i turned to each other and said ' did you see what i just saw ? ” i told him “ we have to do something ”			0
’ now the cost of @entity4 's ongoing care is being funded with help from the hospital , fundraisers from the church and donations from around the world			1
drug - makers @entity176 have agreed to cover the cost of the @entity3			2

who knows , maybe one day he can go to university and make a great life for himself			2
' words can express how grateful we are to the people who have helped us			0
it feels like a dream come true ' @entity47 , @entity4 's mother ‘ our biggest fear was that the condition would be incurable and his life would still be at risk			1
and , of course , we 're nervous about the surgery			0
but we 've been told the chances are good			0
‘ he 's excited to be able to wear collared shirts like his uncles			2
there is a girl he has a crush on and he 's hoping she will think he looks handsome			2
‘ he 's very brave			2
he 's been through so much yet he always keeps a smile on his face			2
