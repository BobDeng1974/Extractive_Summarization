by @entity0 the president of a @entity3 university has come under fire from conservatives for asking students how to make the campus less white			1
in a controversial questionnaire making the rounds of @entity11 , president @entity8 asked students , ' how do we make sure that in future years we are not as white as we are today ? ' @entity8 has been vocal about his goal of creating a more diverse faculty and student body since he took office six years ago			1
hard questions : western @entity11 's @entity8 is asking staff and students how to attract students from a more diverse range of backgrounds in the university 's opening convocation in 2012 , he said : ' every year , from this stage and at this time , you have heard me say that , if in decades ahead , we are as white as we are today , we will have failed as university			1
' despite backlash from conservative pundits , @entity8 is unapologetic about his stance			1
' i needed to provoke attention to the changing demography of our state , and when you use words like " white , " that does get people 's attention , ' he told @entity41			0
in a recent blog post , @entity8 clarified his position			2
' high school graduation numbers in our state are flat and are projected to remain so			0
within those flat graduation numbers , the percentage coming from families from diverse ethnic and racial groups where parents have not gone to college is rapidly increasing , ' he wrote			0
all white now : the university has traditionally drawn white students from upper middle class backgrounds , a group that is diminishing support : faculty and students have been supportive of @entity8 's diversity goals the aim , he wrote , is not to keep white students out , it 's to attract more students from other backgrounds that reflect the state 's changing demography			1
the pool from which the university traditionally draws its students is getting smaller - meaning that to survive , the school needs to diversify			2
' it is about whether we will have the wisdom , the culture , the commitment , to be able to attract a sufficient number of students from diverse backgrounds , ' he wrote			2
' in the decades ahead , should we be as white as we are today , we will be relentlessly driven toward mediocrity ; or , become a sad shadow of our current self			0
' @entity8 has incurred the wrath of sites such as @entity84 , a self - styled ' campus watchdog ' for conservative students , which cast @entity8 's goal of racial diversity as an attempt to discourage white students from attending the school			1
' i think he 's being very insensitive to how people are perceived based on the color of their skin , ' said editor - in - chief @entity94			0
unapologetic : @entity8 says that his choice of words was intended to fuel discussion a @entity100 response stated ' dear sir : you need to resign immediately ! your white mediocrity is a stain to the fabric of @entity11			1
' @entity8 said his wording was designed to provoke a response			2
' understanding requires conversations on our campus that are wide and deep , thoughtful and informed			0
and , if being provocative helps stimulate those conversations well , then , guess i am merely doing my job , ' he wrote on the blog			0
only about 20 per cent of @entity11 's 15,000 students come from minority backgrounds			1
@entity8 says he has received many messages of support from staff and students , but he has increased security from campus police following threats			1
early wednesday evening , @entity127 and @entity11 student body president @entity126 responded to critics			2
' we will not waste a moment â€™s time responding to extremist media and the hate mongers they pander to			0
we believe that difficult questions must be answered thoughtfully and deliberately , ' they said , reports @entity136			0
racial background is not a factor in admissions at @entity11 .			0
