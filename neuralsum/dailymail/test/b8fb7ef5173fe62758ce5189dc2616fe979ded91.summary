@entity0 has scored 25 goals for @entity2 since the start of last season , none more vital than a dramatic extra-time winner in the @entity8 final			1
but his last one — the only goal of the game at @entity11 — meant the world , because it was for someone special			1
‘ i ’ve had a tough few weeks , ’ said @entity0 , who pointed skywards after scoring at @entity14			1
‘ i ’ve been on an emotional rollercoaster of late			2
my gran passed away a few weeks ago and she meant an awful lot to me			1
we had a great relationship and i ’ve dedicated my last couple of goals to her			1
@entity0 celebrates his goal against @entity11 by dedicating it to his late @entity25 who passed away ‘ her name is @entity28			1
she ’s on my @entity30 ’s side and we used to call her @entity31			1
she was an incredible woman			2
‘ she lost her husband early in her life and raised seven kids on her own and in those days it was an incredibly difficult thing to do			2
she was always happy , making jokes and i had that sort of outlook on life			2
she always believed in me and gave me reassurances			2
it has been a difficult time			1
’ his grandmother would have been proud of young @entity0 as he took time out from preparations for today ’s @entity8 semi-final against @entity45 to pay his tribute to her			1
just as she must have been proud of his career in football and the way he rebuilt it after a badly broken leg			2
‘ she used to watch me play and would take me to games when i was eight or nine , ’ @entity0 added			1
‘ she would always be asking how i was doing			2
she did n’t go to my games but i got her @entity54 to watch a few			0
she would always complain it was not on normal tv			0
’ @entity0 will be on ‘ normal tv ’ when the @entity59 screen today ’s semi-final from @entity60 , as he was last may when his 16th goal of a prolific season won the @entity8 and ended @entity2 ’s nine - year wait for a trophy			1
‘ it was a great day and a great moment in my career , ’ he said			0
‘ it was a relief as well			0
’ @entity0 points to the sky has the goalscorer is greeted by @entity2 right back @entity71 at @entity14 @entity0 and @entity71 celebrate on the deck after the @entity74 midfielder had fired home for the @entity76 @entity2 had fought back from two down against @entity77 and 108 minutes had elapsed when @entity0 fired his side into a 3 - 2 lead before going off on a celebratory sprint which he ended flat on his back , exhausted , beneath a pile of jubilant team - mates			1
‘ i was knackered , ’ smiled @entity0			1
‘ we were in extra-time and my celebration , i did n’t really know what to do			1
i was just running about and it all caught up on me then so i needed a couple of seconds just to get my breath back and realise just what i ’d just actually done			2
and it was a great way to finish the season for me personally and for the team finally to win something			2
it was an amazing feeling			0
@entity0 wheels away in celebration after scoring in extra time at @entity60 against @entity77 @entity0 is joined by @entity103 midfielder @entity102 during the @entity104 at @entity60 in 2014 the @entity74 goalscorer is mobbed by his friends as they celebrate his goal at @entity60 in 2014 ‘ i ’m no different to anyone else			1
my dream was always scoring a goal in the @entity8 final and i had managed to live my dream			1
then to see how much it meant to people when a quarter of a million came out on the streets the next day			0
it was a beautiful day and you could see everyone was in it together			0
’ @entity0 had played in the 2008 fa cup final for @entity121 aged 17 , but his winners ’ medal now takes pride of place in a display cabinet in the study at his home			1
‘ i ’ve a few shirts in there , my debut shirt at @entity121 , the @entity8 winners ’ shirt , some boots to mark my achievements , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ and there ’s a big desk in there which i never use			0
the @entity140 looks chuffed as he sets his eyes on the gleaming silverware he helped earn his side @entity144 hugs his @entity8 following his goal against @entity77 at @entity60 in 2014 more than a quarter of a million fans took to the streets to celebrates @entity2 's 2014 @entity8 success ‘ that feeling you get after winning is difficult to get			1
everyone realised we wanted more			0
we are putting pressure on ourselves to get the best from each other and i feel we ’ve done that in the second half of this season			0
‘ we ’ve really stuck by each other , worked hard for each other and we want another feeling like we had last season			0
we do push ourselves as a team and i think the title is getting closer			0
last season we started really well and maybe faded away			0
we lost against the bigger teams , but this season we ’ve done better against them			0
this season , we did n’t start too well but the second half has been really good and consistent			0
i feel we are very close			0
’ if @entity171 collapse against the odds in the title race , @entity2 are best placed to pounce after a run of 33 points from a dozen @entity177 games since @entity178			1
‘ that ’s still a possibility , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ you ca n’t rule it out			0
when you have that momentum , it is still possible			0
even though it will be difficult we have to win our remaining games and see where that leaves us			2
‘ it ’s going to be difficult			0
@entity171 have a lot of points , so they will have to slip up a few times for us to catch them			0
so it will be difficult , but it ’s still possible			0
’ his optimism reflects the mood in @entity2 ’s camp , very different from this time last year when they went into an @entity8 semi-final stifled by the desperation to end the trophy - free years and @entity203 ’s uncertain future			1
they staggered past @entity205 on penalties			0
@entity2 goalkeeper @entity207 makes a save against @entity205 during @entity8 semi final match @entity207 's save helped @entity2 to progress to the @entity8 final which they won at @entity60 in 2014 @entity2 are stronger and more solid now , with more weaponry , flair and freedom than last year			1
but that does not mean they will swat @entity45 aside			0
‘ we probably did feel the pressure , ’ admitted @entity0			1
‘ but we got through and went on to win it and we have n’t got that sort of pressure now			2
that pressure is gone because we won something and there is no more of this “ nine years ”			2
‘ it ’s a different sort of pressure , but one we ’ve been up against many times when we ’ve played lesser teams			0
it ’s important not to take the game lightly			0
we just have to focus and if we manage ourselves correctly , we will go through			0
’ @entity2 manager @entity203 will be hoping to add another piece of silverware to his collection			1

@entity0 starred when @entity2 won the @entity8 against @entity77 in 2014
his extra-time goal helped @entity203 's side claim the silverware
this time he is hoping to win it for his @entity28 who passed away
@entity140 has dedicated his last couple of goals to her in *memory*
