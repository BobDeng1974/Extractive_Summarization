but the teenager 's drastic weight - loss happened so quickly it left him with folds of excess skin around his stomach - and his hopes of having the rolls removed have been quashed after the @entity22 deemed the surgery ' non-essential '			1

' i feel nothing but hatred towards the @entity22 , ' said @entity8 , from @entity43			1
' i did n’t ask for a gastric band or anything like that to get a better life - the fact is i did it all on my own through keep fit and eating properly			0
' what i do n’t understand why women who have flat chests can receive implants off the @entity22 - yet i ca n’t have my saggy skin removed because it is non-essential , ' the former @entity51 student said			1
spare flesh : @entity8 says the rolls of excess skin left after his rapid weight loss are making him depressed unemployed mr @entity26 , who said he ca n't afford to pay £ 6,000 to have the surgery privately , said he is psychologically affected by his rolls of saggy skin , and that getting rid of them would ' change my whole life '			1
' no matter how much i train , nothing can get rid of this extra skin around my waist , so removing it surgically is my only option			0
' the only way i can live my life to the full and forge a good career for myself in the army is having it removed			1
it would cost £ 6,000 to get it done privately , but i do n’t have that kind of money			0
' i can feel the saggy skin jiggle when i ’m running - so i could n’t imagine getting down to the ground to do press up in front of the guys			2
i would n’t even be able to go swimming as part of the training			0
' i just want to feel normal - i ’m not asking for the world			0
i have never asked for any help until now - i lost all the weight on my own by getting on the treadmill			2
' but i now feel more miserable now than i did when i was fat because this excess skin is stopping me from what i want to do in life - it is making me so depressed			2
' ' i would gorge on everything and anything ' : @entity8 , pictured holding his little brother @entity96 , once ate up to 100 packets of @entity10 or @entity98 every week it was depression brought on by his parents divorce that saw @entity8 start to pile on the pounds at the age of 14			2
' i would gorge on everything and anything , but @entity10 and @entity106 crisps were my favourite - i 'd eat around a hundred packets a week			0
' crisps were my favourite - i 'd eat around a hundred packets a week ' @entity8 ' and i ’d drink a two litres bottle of coke a day - i ’d have it by my bed so it was the first thing i tasted in the morning - i was so bad			1
' the teenager would spend all of his money on junk food and obsess about what he was going to eat next , but managed to keep his addiction hidden from those closest to him			0
' i would stash all the junk in my bedroom and i would n’t eat anywhere else , ' he said			0
' i would eat beans and toast for breakfast every morning and then i ’d go without food all day at school so people would n’t see me eat			0
' i would get called all the fat jibes thrown to me at school , but i did n’t care , i just hated my life and food was my comfort			0
' i remember i was 16 when the scales in my bathroom could n’t even read my weight because i was so heavy - the dial kept going round and round			2
that was when i was 21 stone - i was only 16			2
' ' miserable ' : @entity8 has said he ca n't afford to pay thousands to have the excess skin surgically removed privately the turning point came in may last year when @entity8 came across a shoebox full of photographs and medals from his days of playing for a junior football team			1
' i remember putting one of the medals round my neck and felt a buzz of happiness - it realised it had been the only in my life when i ’d felt proud of myself and i wanted to get that feeling back , ' @entity8 said			1
' i had always wanted to join the army but was told i needed to get down to 12 and a half stone			2
' my dad would joke and say i would be on my death bed before i ’d decided to do it - and it would be too late			0
it was at that moment i decided to turn my life around and lose the weight			0
' @entity8 enrolled at a gym in @entity43 the next day and devised his very own fitness plan which he followed religiously , building up from walking to interval training then eventually running			1
' it was tough , especially the mentality needed to do it , but i was so determined , ' he said			0
' after a month i ’d lost a stone and the weight started falling off me			2
' i felt really positive and like my life was going in a new direction			0
i still felt massive , but every day i trained and every pound i lost meant i was one step closer to my dream career			0
' determined : @entity8 devised his own military - style fitness regime and stuck to it religiously ' mortified ' : the @entity43 teenager says he would be too embarassed to take his top off or do press - ups in front of other soldiers by february , @entity8 was a stone under the army ’s goal weight for entry - and his application could go through			1
the delighted teenager contacted his doctor to seek advice on getting rid of his folds of loose skin , but despite being referred to specialists for a consultation he was told he could not have the operation due to @entity22 policy			1
the @entity22 will not pay for body contouring for cosmetic reasons alone			1
' i could go into the army with it but i could never feel comfortable , ' said @entity8			1
' i am confident in my fitness and mental ability but i have absolutely no body confidence because of it			0
' i dream of going to @entity204 one day but i could never ever take my top off in the heat - i ’d be mortified			1
' dr @entity207 , @entity22 @entity208 medical director , said : ' the primary care trust has a policy in place to help make clear and rational decisions in difficult cases such as this			0
' cases are considered carefully by a panel of experts and there is always an appeals process available			0
