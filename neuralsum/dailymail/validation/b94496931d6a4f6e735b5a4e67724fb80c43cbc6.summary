it ’s a common sight on the streets of @entity3 ’s most populous city @entity4			1
but the image of an incredibly overloaded delivery bike still manages to boggle the mind of anyone who sees it			2
captured cycling through the streets of @entity4 , two men are shown carrying a ridiculously large load of seven huge boxes of paper			1
parked , the two bikes are dwarfed under the load of the seven boxes that they each carry straining under the weight of the cargo the three - wheeled bikes can be heard groaning as the riders go about making their delivery			1
despite being dwarfed by the extremely heavy load , the riders move relatively fast towards their destination			0
@entity28 parked at the side of the road after arriving , one of the bikes is shown toppled backwards under the weight of the boxes			2
one of the bikes moves relatively quickly considering the size and weight of its load the pair are then seen untying the rope around the boxes before offloading the paper onto the street			0
pulling the rope from the top , one man manages to put his bike back on all three wheels before he attempts to remove the highest stacked box			0
because of @entity3 ’s huge population , many locals have adopted this means of transport as a way of getting around effectively			0
@entity55 , motorbikes , mopeds and scooters are all used in place of transit vans and @entity61 as a way of avoiding the congestion			0
one of the bikes in unable to sustain the weight of the load when stationery and topples onto its two back wheels one of the men pulls a rope from the top of the cargo to put his bike back on all three wheels before unloading			1
