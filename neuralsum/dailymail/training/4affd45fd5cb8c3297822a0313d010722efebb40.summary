it did n't end up quite as badly as the @entity1 in @entity2 , but a @entity4 valet has lost his job this week after being caught taking a brand new corvette out for a spin - and pushing the car to 50 mph in seconds			1
@entity10 , the owner of the 2015 @entity11 - which are priced between $ 60,000 and $ 70,000 - dropped his car off at the @entity13 in @entity14 on sunday as he took his wife to see a concert			1
the attendant who gets in the vehicle decides to take a joy ride around the garage before parking , however @entity10 had cleverly activated a new feature called ' @entity23 '			2
the new @entity25 model is equipped with a @entity26 ( @entity26 ) , which is a built - in video camera that records everything from speed to gear changes and revs			1
and then fired @entity23 records the car when it is in drive from the time the setting is activated to when it is turned off , so owner can see exactly where their car has gone , or have proof if an attendant were to hit something and cause damage			1
@entity10 car was not dented , but the @entity26 camera captured alot more than he imagined			2
at one point , in a quiet section of the parking garage , the valet takes the car up to 50 mph			2
then , once parking it , about a minute and a half after getting in the car , he steps in front of the @entity71 , presumably to ensure he did n't hit the retaining wall in front			0
the move meant he was captured by the dash cam , effectively identifying himself			0
' when he parked the car into the stall , he went out of the car and looked at the front end of the car … i was concerned about damage about the front of the car , but fortunately there was no damage , ' @entity10 told @entity87			0
' you hear stories about valet , you see things in the past and you hope that 's an exception and not the norm			0
' sleek : the 2015 @entity97 was unveiled in february and costs between $ 60,000 - $ 70,000 clever : @entity23 records the car when it is in drive from the time the setting is activated to when it is turned off , so owner can see exactly where their car has gone however , @entity10 had further problems when reporting what he discovered to the owner of the valet company			1
' the owner called me up yesterday , the first thing he said he spoke to his attorney and told me the video was illegal , " @entity10 said			0
" i think my impression was the owner did n’t realize the video was built into the car			1
' i informed him this was standard of corvettes and that as long as audio is n’t recorded in @entity4 it ’s not illegal			0
' the owner informed @entity10 the valet had been fired for inappropriate behavior			2
the story has parallels to the pinnacle point of 1986 comedy favorite @entity2 starring @entity131			1
brat pack : in the 1986 blockbuster comedy , directed by @entity134 , @entity2 takes a rare red @entity1 out for a spin - even though it belonged to his friend 's father classic : the film finishes with the prized @entity1 ending up in a ravine in the film , @entity2 convinces his friend @entity142 to ‘ borrow ’ his father ’s vintage 1962 @entity143			1
director @entity134 said in interviews at the time that there were only 100 of those cars ever produced			0
in the movie , @entity142 is fearful of his father ’s retribution after he discovers that they ’ve put a few hundred miles on the car ’s odometer			0
in an effort to ‘ undo ’ the mileage , @entity2 suggests that they run the car in reverse			2
however @entity142 kicks the car out of anger , sending it plummeting into a ravine .			0

*similar* to 1986 blockbuster @entity2
