house speaker @entity0 on thursday starkly warned president @entity1 that if he meddles in the immigration system and issues an executive order granting millions of illegals amnesty , he 'll sorely regret it			1
' when you play with matches , you take the risk of burning yourself , ' @entity0 said today at a @entity10 press conference			2
' and he 's going to burn himself if he continues to go down this path			0
' the @entity13 leader was responding to @entity1 's commitment on wednesday ' to take whatever lawful actions ' he can to make changes to the deportation process - with or without the permission of @entity19 - before the end of the year			1
' i think it 's fair to say that i 've shown a lot of patience and tried to work on a bipartisan basis as much as possible and will keep doing so			0
' but in the absence of congressional action , @entity1 again promised to make his own reforms			2
the president has not said what moves he 's considering , but @entity44 officials have indicated that anywhere between one and 11 million illegal immigrants could be allowed to stay in the @entity46 as a direct result			0
challenging @entity0 , @entity1 said on wednesday , ' you send me a bill that i can sign and those executive actions go away			1

' senate minority leader @entity56 , who is slated to become majority leader of the @entity58 in january , said wednesday that @entity1 was taking the wrong approach to altering the nation 's broken immigration system			1
' i think the president choosing to do a lot of things unilaterally on immigration would be a big mistake , ' @entity62 told reporters during a press conference out of @entity70 , where he had just been reelected to his @entity58 seat the night before			1
' it 's an issue that most of my members want to address legislatively and it 's like waving a red flag in front of a bull to say , " if you guys do n't do what i want , i 'm going to do it on my own			0
" ' i hope he wo n't do that because i do think it poisons the well for the opportunity to address a very important domestic issue , ' @entity62 said			0
@entity0 reiterated @entity62 's observation on thursday , saying if @entity1 acts on his own will to ' @entity85 ' for broader reforms to the immigration process ' and there will be no chance for immigration reform moving in this @entity19			1
' the @entity46 people made it clear @entity96 , they want to get things done , and they do n't want the president acting on a unilateral basis , ' @entity0 said			1
the house speaker , who has long said he 's in favor of reforming the immigration system in a step - by - step fashion rather than the president 's preferred comprehensive method , said he was doing his best to come up with a package that all parties involved could agree to			0
' i could regale you with all of my challenges of trying to get members on both sides of the aisle to deal with this			0
but hope springs eternal , ' he said			0
not bluffing : president @entity1 recommitted on wednesday to saving millions of illegal immigrants from deportation by issuing an executive order giving them work permits the @entity13 legislator signaled on thursday that the post-election @entity124 between the @entity44 and @entity13 , at least as far as he is concerned , is already over , just two days after the midterm election that gave his party a historic number of seats in @entity19			1
' my job is not to get along with the president , just to get along with him , although we actually have a nice relationship , ' @entity0 told reproters today			1
' my job is to listen to my members and listen to the @entity46 people and make their priorities our priorities			2
' at today 's presser and in an op - ed with @entity62 that appeared in today 's @entity140 made it clear that chief among his concerns is getting rid of the health care reform law			0
' the @entity46 people have made it clear they are not for @entity146 , ' @entity0 said today			1
' ask all those democrats who lost their elections tuesday			0
a lot of them voted for @entity146			2
' realistically , @entity13 have no shot in @entity153 of getting the president to sign off on a repeal of @entity146			1
however , @entity0 waved off the critical point as irrelevant today			2
' just because we might not be able to get everything we want does n't mean we should n't try to get what we can , ' @entity0 contended			2
' there are bipartisan majorities in the @entity44 and @entity58 to take some of these issues out of @entity146			0
we need to put them on the president 's desk and let him choose , ' the @entity23 representative said			0
as @entity0 was pledging on @entity26 to stand his ground on @entity146 and other issues key to the @entity13 's agenda , @entity44 press secretary @entity167 was assuring reporters at his daily briefing at @entity44 that the president is dedicated to finding ' common ground ' with republicans in @entity19			1
the president looks forward to meeting with @entity0 and other congressional leaders for lunch tomorrow at the @entity44 , @entity167 said , suggesting that a new era of bipartisanship could be on the way in @entity10			2
@entity0 seemed suspicious on thursday at his own briefing , across town , that the @entity185 president actually intends to compromise with @entity13			1
' finding common ground is going to be hard work , but it will be even harder if the president is nâ€™t willing to work with us , ' @entity0 said .			1

@entity1 recommitted on wednesday ' to take whatever lawful actions ' he can to make changes to the deportation process through executive order
@entity0 pushed back on @entity1 on thursday ; ' my job is not to get along with the president , just to get along with him , ' he told reporters
