need some inspiration deciding who to back at @entity2 ? @entity4 's @entity3 and @entity5 reveal their favourites ... @entity5 - eight - time champion jockey and rider of 13 @entity9 winners @entity10 no secret that this is regarded as one of @entity16 ’s best chances of the week			1
he was recruited from @entity18 , where he showed decent form on the flat , and although he was beaten by a good rival on his hurdling debut , has won his two races since			1
last time out he slammed @entity24 , who ran a commendable fourth in the @entity26 here on tuesday			2
best odds : 6 - 1 @entity16 and @entity29 won the @entity30 at @entity2 in december @entity31 ( @entity32 , 3.20 ) rain would admittedly diminish confidence in @entity36 ’s runner but he has all the credentials to run really well			1
he has won at the past two festivals , peaks at this time of year and has been re-fitted with the blinkers which seem to bring out the best in him			2
his last time out victory at @entity44 indicated the spark had been rekindled in this gelding by his shrewd trainer after a couple of moderate efforts			2
best odds : 9 - 1 @entity50 , 4.0 ) owned , but not trained , by @entity51 and prepared for this race by one of his long - time staff , @entity54			1
had won his previous seven point - to - points before being taken up to @entity56 where he sauntered home in a @entity59			2
@entity51 is pictured with sir @entity60 and owns current event best odds : 9 - 1 @entity62 ( @entity63 , 5.15 ) fourth in this race last year after trying to make all the running and only being overhauled after the last fence			1
he races off a similar handicap mark and , while his form this season has been a touch below par , he has had a breathing operation since his last run			0
best odds : 10 - 1 @entity76 - @entity3 on the best each - way bets @entity78 ( @entity11 , 1.30 ) @entity81 ’s entry has been locking horns with the best juvenile hurdlers all season and , while a sequence of four second places might seem off - putting , he does not lack heart			1
fast pace should play to his strengths and could hit the frame			0
best odds : 20 - 1 @entity91 ( pictured right ) is a decent each way bet in the opener on the @entity9 's final day @entity96 ( @entity97 ’ @entity98 , 2.40 ) romped home in january ’s @entity100 at @entity101 and subsequently beaten at @entity102			1
but those races were at a shorter distance and the mount of @entity106 shapes as if he will improve for the greater stamina test			0
best odds : 33 - 1 the giant bolster ( @entity32 , 3.20 ) has become a regular in this race having finished second , fourth and third in the last three runnings			1
form this season has been unspectacular but this has been the day local trainer @entity115 has trained him for all season			0
hard to see him winning but easier to see him in the places under regular jockey @entity120			0
best odds : 33 - 1 @entity121 work @entity122 : one last dream ( @entity124 , 5.45 ) weighting game : that ’s @entity127 ( @entity128 , 2.55 )			0
down 22lb from last winning mark			0
@entity130 : @entity131 ( @entity132 , 4.25 )			0

@entity5 fancies @entity29 to give @entity16 the *perfect* start to his final day at @entity2 in the @entity11
the eight - time champion jockey also reckons @entity31 has the chance to run well in the @entity32
@entity5 , who rode 13 @entity9 winners , also fancies @entity140 in the @entity141 and @entity142 in the @entity63
meanwhile , @entity3 *highlights* @entity91 in the @entity11 , @entity144 in the @entity145 ’ @entity98 and @entity146 in the @entity32 as decent each way punts
