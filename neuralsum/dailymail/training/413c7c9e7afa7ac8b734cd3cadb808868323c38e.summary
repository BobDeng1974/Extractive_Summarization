@entity1 chancellor @entity0 is said to be furious after her office rug was found to be part of a collection of treasures looted by @entity6 @entity1 chancellor @entity0 is this week faced with the tricky question of what to do with her office rug after it was discovered to be part of a collection of treasures looted by @entity12 's deputy @entity6			1
the rug was discovered by journalists writing for news magazine @entity15 about @entity17 items that should have been returned to their owners but are still scattered about government guest houses , offices and museums			1
mrs @entity0 is said to be furious with her aides at the embarrassing revelation , coming as it does months before her third bid for power in the general election and with the opposition snapping at her heels			1
the carpet is described as @entity31 and comes from @entity32			0
the ' @entity39 ' as the @entity41 's loot was known , encompassed paintings , tapestries , jewellery , hunting ornaments , altarpieces - and rugs			1
it is understood the rug will be removed from view by the end of the week			0
the magazine said it is one of more than 600 objects that were amassed by @entity49 commander @entity6 and others during the @entity51 and are still used by the government			1
the former state minister for culture @entity53 has now urged the government to force the return of @entity17 looted items to their rightful owners or their heirs			1
' the legislature must concretise their return , ' he said			0
' more money must also be used for research in @entity1 museums			2
' a giant carpet said to be similar in design to the one in the chancellor 's office was part of the haul of looted art seized by the @entity73 at the close of the war			2
this one adorned the library at @entity78 , @entity6 's ostentatious hunting lodge north of @entity79 , but was taken by him - along with numerous artworks - and shipped to his home near @entity12 's at @entity82 in the early days of 1945			0
there it was seized by the @entity85 and later returned to the state of @entity87			0

it now lies wrapped in silver paper in a @entity87 archive : no - one wants to use it , given its history , but no - one is brave enough to sell it on			0
it is unclear how another @entity39 carpet ended up in the chancellor 's office in @entity79			1
the @entity1 government in 1966 declared the task of reuniting owners with their stolen property to be ' concluded			1
' but tapestry from the same collection as the rug in mrs @entity0 's office adorns the walls of a government guest house on the outskirts of @entity130			1
a stolen walnut secretary - seized by @entity132 who was the @entity17 administrator for all stolen art during the @entity17 - sits in the @entity1 president 's office in @entity79			0
the research also featured a photograph of a platinum watch @entity12 gave his mistress @entity139 in 1939 on her 27th birthday engraved on the back : ' on the 6.2.1939			0
' it was found in a @entity90 museum by the magazine 's researchers			2
other possessions of @entity6 were discovered in @entity90 's @entity148 museum			2

@entity6 , pictured right , with wife @entity93 , left , and @entity159 dictator @entity158 , centre , stole or bought at knock - down prices hundreds of pieces of art for his country estate @entity78 , pictured @entity15 reporters also came across a golden decorated cigarette box with a dedication from @entity6 's wife and daughter in 1940 that read : ' full of happiness and pride , @entity93 and @entity94 congratulate " @entity173 " in intimate love '			0
in 1953 , @entity6 was sentenced to death for war crimes at the @entity96 but cheated the hangman 's noose by killing himself in his cell with a phial of hidden cyanide			0
while there were many thieves in the @entity17 , @entity6 was the biggest magpie of them all and amassed about 2,000 pieces			0
what he did not actually steal from conquered lands he bought at knock - down prices from @entity98 in pre-war @entity1 who needed money to buy exit visas to escape			0
last year , the @entity193 government returned two paintings , that were stolen by @entity39 's aides in 1940 , to the heir of @entity197			1
as well as freebooters like @entity6 , @entity12 sanctioned a special department of thieves called ' @entity201 ' who were licensed to ransack the museums and collections of conquered territories for treasures he intended to display at a ' @entity207 ' in the backwater @entity209 city where he once lived and which he planned to open after the war			2
the @entity17 's plundered thousands of pieces from the countries they invaded			0
general @entity216 , centre , inspects paintings hidden in a salt mine at @entity220 , near @entity221 , @entity103 where the @entity17 government stored art treasures and gold items stolen for the museum included the @entity227 of the @entity228 - never found and worth around £ 200million today - and masterpieces by @entity230 , @entity231 and @entity232 , sculptures and tapestries worth an estimated £ 500million , stolen from the collection of baron @entity236 , a @entity237 - @entity98 industrialist			1
they , too , have never been found			2
it is believed that @entity103 's 6,000 museums are full of @entity17 treasures and looted objects but there are few staff to check on the provenance of the collections			2
in @entity87 just one specialist is on the payroll of the local government to check the origin of 4,400 paintings and 770 sculptures taken in 1933 after the @entity253 came to power .			0
