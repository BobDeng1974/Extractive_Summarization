@entity1 , 38 , who fled after a gang of racist thugs began attacking him and @entity5 , says that it is time for police to abandon their search for the three other killers after two of the yobs were jailed for life last year			2
on monday it will be twenty years since the pair were attacked by five teenagers and @entity5 was fatally stabbed			0
after a huge police operation , that involved officers bugging properties , two of the gang - @entity5 and @entity5 - were finally found guilty last year and imprisoned , the @entity30 councillor for @entity31 says that money should instead be channelled into other murder cases			1
he says it is time for the numerous investigations and inquiries to end			2
he said : ' if you let your emotions lead you do n't want the police to stop looking , you want them to spend as much money as possible			2
' but if you take the emotions out of it , you think about the amount of murder cases which have happened and the amount of money which has been spent on the @entity5 case that has n’t gone into many of those other murders , which might have solved some of those , ' @entity42 reported			1
the 19 - year saga involved a string of failed police inquiries , and is estimated to have cost up to £ 50million the killing led to @entity57 that , over nearly two decades , would involve 16 arrests , 1,378 statements and 835 house calls			1
the 19 - year saga included a series of failed police inquiries and is estimated to have cost up to £ 50million			1
the four - year - long forensic review which prompted the new murder trial cost £ 3.8million			1
the unprecedented , anti-terror style bugging operation on the five prime suspects was made necessary because of the bungled initial police response to @entity5 's murder			0
his thoughts may conflict with those of @entity5 's mother , @entity71 , who has tirelessly campaigned for justice on behalf of her son			0
@entity5 's mother @entity71 speaks to the media alongside @entity5 's father @entity76 and brother @entity77 ( left ) outside the @entity78 in central @entity79 , following the conviction of @entity5 , 36 , and @entity5 for the murder of her son it remains a continuing source of pain for her that three other men — arrested with @entity5 and @entity5 back in 1993 — are not facing trial , as there is no new forensic evidence linking them to @entity5			0
@entity71 says she feels anger rather than hatred towards the men , who , consumed with racial loathing , killed her son in an unprovoked attack which lasted , the court heard , barely ten seconds			0
the 60 - year - old ’s reputation for being a tough campaigner has won her places on various boards advising government policy makers and senior police officers on race relations			1
however , regardless of the laws now in place promoting racial equality , she believes racism still exists			0
awarded an obe in 2003 in recognition of her work , @entity71 says she will continue fighting to give young men like @entity5 all the opportunities he was denied			0
