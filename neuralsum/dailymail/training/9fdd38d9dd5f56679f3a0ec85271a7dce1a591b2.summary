@entity0 did not require long to show just why @entity1 sought his services this month			1
the former @entity4 striker , signed on - loan from @entity6 , arrived as a substitute in the 63rd minute with the match goalless			1
five minutes later , with seemingly his first touch , he had edged @entity10 ahead			1
like his goal against @entity13 in the @entity14 , this came from just two yards out – here , a poke home after @entity18 ’s long throw had been glanced skywards by @entity19			2
@entity0 celebrates giving @entity10 the lead over @entity21 @entity0 runs away in celebration after scoring the opening goal for @entity10 in the @entity25 tie @entity10 pushed on for promotion in the @entity25 by seeing off @entity21 @entity10 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity27 ; @entity18 6.5 , @entity28 7 , @entity29 7 , @entity30 6.5 ; @entity31 6.5 , @entity32 7 , @entity33 7 ; @entity34 6 ( @entity35 86 ’ ) , @entity36 6 , @entity37 6 ( @entity38 ’ 8 ) subs not used : @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 booked : @entity34 , @entity33 goals : @entity0 ( 68 , 90 ) manager : @entity1 7 @entity21 ( 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 ) : @entity47 6 ; @entity48 6 , @entity49 6.5 ( @entity50 77 ’ ) , @entity19 6.5 , @entity51 6 ; @entity52 5 ( @entity53 43 ’ 4 ( @entity54 64 ’ 5 ) ) , @entity55 6 , @entity56 6 , @entity57 6.5 ; @entity58 6 ; king 6 subs not used : @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 booked : @entity51 , @entity65 manager : @entity67 6 referee : @entity69 6 @entity70 : @entity0 attendance : 26,373 @entity0 scored again in injury time , once more from close range			1
he tapped in when @entity36 ’s shot from @entity35 ’s cross spilled his way			0
small distances , big difference			0
@entity0 ’s impact means @entity1 ’s team move up to second , level on points with leaders @entity84			1
already his temporary move , costing @entity10 around a quarter of his £ 65,000 per week wages , is paying off			1
a joke cruel on @entity89 ’s side swiftly emerged at full - time			1
@entity0 is now @entity6 ’s top scorer this season – with five goals including two from his loan spell at @entity94			1
@entity95 has four in a claret and blue shirt			0
any thoughts @entity99 might have of going the opposite direction to @entity0 this january were dashed when he lasted just 21 minutes			1
starting on the bench , he was introduced shortly before the interval following an injury to @entity52 , but was himself forced off midway through the second half			2
as he limped away he must have recognised this was this was far from a productive outing in the shop window			0
@entity109 and @entity110 have been suitors so far baulking at his £ 4million fee			0
oddly , @entity50 , another target for top - flight clubs keen on buying an attacking edge this month , remained on the bench even then			0
instead @entity67 sent @entity54 on for @entity99 , and he brought a brilliant save from @entity116 with a left - foot shot soon after			0
@entity50 , who @entity118 have looked at for £ 11m , only arrived when injury to @entity49 forced @entity67 ’s hand			0
he was unable to alter the course of events			0
@entity28 tries to block a shot by @entity125 's @entity124 during the @entity25 match @entity10 are continuing their push for promotion to the top flight with their latest win over @entity21 @entity10 dismissed @entity13 in their @entity14 match but still kept their promotion push on track these two teams entered this match having enjoyed @entity14 victories			1
@entity10 dismissed @entity13 , @entity21 stunned @entity118			1
fifth round matches against @entity138 and @entity139 can wait , though			0
at any rate , both clubs would take promotion to the @entity143 ahead of cup silverware			1
@entity10 were looking for a response to their last @entity25 encounter , a dramatic defeat here to @entity149			2
@entity21 had slipped into the distance of the play - off race in recent weeks , entering this match without a league win in four games			0
@entity10 began the aggressors , pinning the visitors back			2
in the fifth minute @entity33 cut inside and struck a sweet drive that crashed into the stanchion			0
in the 19th minute @entity31 fed @entity34 but the winger fired over			0
by the half hour @entity10 ’s passing was slick and a smart move involving @entity33 , @entity31 and @entity36 saw @entity37 teed up			1
@entity21 did have a chance three minutes before the interval , but @entity116 did well to scoop away @entity65 ’s dipping volley			0
in all likelihood this match would have ended goalless but for the intervention of @entity0 , a player determined to prove aged 30 he still has what it takes to score in the top division			2
if he keeps going in this manner he might just fire @entity10 there			2
@entity10 were looking for a response from their last @entity25 defeat against @entity149 @entity33 of @entity10 pictured during the @entity25 match against @entity21			2

neither side could break the *deadlock* before half - time
@entity0 scored the opening goal for @entity1 's side after 68 minutes before *doubling* their lead in the 90th minute
it keeps @entity10 on track for promotion to the @entity143
