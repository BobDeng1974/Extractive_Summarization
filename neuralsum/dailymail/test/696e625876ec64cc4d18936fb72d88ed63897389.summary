still employed : @entity0 is not expected to take any action against @entity2 , whose reporting was roundly discredited an independent review of @entity0 's story about an alleged violent gang rape at the @entity7 said the story fell apart because of ' basic , even routine ' failures of journalism			1
professors at the @entity12 issued a 12,000 - word autopsy of the discredited story sunday night , going through its shortcomings step by step			1
@entity0 bosses commissioned the review after the story , by contributing editor @entity2 , was called into serious question			1
however , despite the uncompromising conclusions of the journalism experts , nobody will lose their job over the story			0
@entity27 , the publisher of @entity0 , confirmed to the @entity28 that everybody would remain in their positions			2
he defended her reporting , and described the supposed rape victim as ' a really expert fabulist storyteller '			2
@entity2 , who went to ground as the row over her article erupted , issued an apology in the wake of the review , admitting ' i did not go far enough '			2
her piece credulously recounted the story of an anonymous student - referred to as @entity44 - who said she was lured to the @entity46 house and raped by a gang of seven men			1
it described the ordeal , during which @entity44 said she was passed from man to man in an excruciating three hours of pain , during which she was also supposedly penetrated with a beer bottle upstairs during a pledging event			1
the article recounted the event in vivid , graphic detail based on @entity44 's account			1
it said : ' there was a heavy person on top of her , spreading open her thighs , and another person kneeling on her hair , hands pinning down her arms , sharp shards digging into her back , and excited male voices rising all around her			0
' when yet another hand clamped over her mouth , @entity44 bit it , and the hand became a fist that punched her in the face			0
the men surrounding her began to laugh			0
@entity44 stared at the young man , silently begging him not to go through with it			0
' and as he shoved the bottle into her , @entity44 fell into a stupor , mentally untethering from the brutal tableau , her mind leaving behind the bleeding body under assault on the floor			2
' the review spelled out extensive contact between @entity2 and @entity44 , spanning eight interviews			1
@entity2 wrote 405 pages of notes about the story			1
@entity44 also spent four hours speaking to a @entity0 fact - checker			1
anonymous : @entity44 has never been identified			0
police officials say she refused to be interviewed in the course of their investigation @entity2 had asked repeatedly for the name of the supposed attacker , but @entity44 said she was not ' comfortable ' with the idea of him being contacted for the story			1
but they ultimately decided to rely on her for virtually all the information in the account , which led to inconsistencies not being discovered until after publication			0
@entity2 asked @entity44 again for the name once the public interrogation of her account began			1
this time she agreed - but it emerged she did not even know how to spell the surname of the man , referred to as ' @entity126 ' in the story			0
experts at @entity129 concluded that @entity2 , her editors , and the fact - checking department all failed to try hard enough to speak to the accused , and other people mentioned in the story			2
and , they said , when they did speak to organizations , including the fraternity and @entity7 , they provided so little information that there was no way for them to check the events themselves and flag any inconsistent information			0
they said that had they reached out to some people named - specifically friends whom @entity44 spoke to immediately after the supposed rape - her credibility would have collapsed in time to ditch the story			1
@entity2 asked to speak to one of the friends - fellow student @entity154 - using @entity44 as a go - between			1
@entity44 told @entity2 he refused and was ' incredulous ' at the request , calling the @entity0 article a 's * * * show '			1
@entity154 later said that @entity44 never spoke to him at all			0
@entity2 admitted that if she had spoken to @entity154 and realized the inconsistency , she would likely have dropped @entity44 's story			1
claims : the story published in november focused on a @entity7 student named @entity44 who claimed to have been gang raped by seven men at the campus ' @entity46 fraternity two years ago			1
above , the frat house on january 15 , 2015 another possible way @entity2 could have found out inconsistencies in the story would have been giving fuller details to the fraternity and @entity7 when asking them for comment , the review said			2
@entity177 , the chapter president of @entity46 , was asked to comment on the allegations without being given dates of the supposed attack or any details about who was involved			0
he told the review : ' it was complete bull * * * t. they were n't telling me what they were going to write about			0
they were n't telling me any dates or details			0
' when the full story was published , @entity46 responded by pointing out there had been no party on the date @entity44 gave			2
they also said that - despite claims of a pledging ritual taking place at the time - the fraternity house was then home to no pledges			0
the review concluded : ' @entity0 's repudiation of the main narrative in a rape on @entity207 is a story of journalistic failure that was avoidable			1
' the failure encompassed reporting , editing , editorial supervision and fact - checking			0
' the magazine set aside or rationalized as unnecessary essential practices of reporting that , if pursued , would likely have led the magazine 's editors to reconsider publishing @entity44 's narrative so prominently , if at all			1
' the published story glossed over the gaps in the magazine 's reporting by using pseudonyms and by failing to state where important information had come from			0
' it recommended that @entity0 tighten its procedures around fact - checking and offer more details when requesting comment from subjects			2
it also questioned the use of pseudonyms , and said the magazine should consider banning them			0
at the same time as publishing the review , @entity0 announced that it was ' officially retracting ' the story , which has amassed more than 2.7million views online			2
the page where the story was hosted until sunday night now redirected to the @entity129 review , which has the subtitle ' an anatomy of a journalistic failure '			0
@entity244 , one of @entity44 's editors , described the scandal over the article as ' it 's been an extraordinarily painful and humbling experience '			1
he later added : ' ultimately , we were too deferential to our rape victim ; we honored too many of her requests in our reporting			0
' we should have been much tougher , and in not doing that , we maybe did her a disservice			0
' in a personal statement released online , @entity2 said : ' reading the @entity129 account of the mistakes and misjudgements in my reporting was a brutal and humbling expereince			2
' i want to offer my deepest apologies : to @entity0 's readers , to my @entity0 editors and colleagues , to the @entity7 community , and to any victims of sexual assault who may feel fearful as a resolut of my article			1
she said that as a reporter she must : ' weigh my compassion against my journalistic duty to find the truth			0
' however , in the case of @entity44 and her account of her traumatic rape , i did not go far enough to verify her story			2
' i allowed my concern for @entity44 's well - being , my fear of re-traumatizing her , and my confidence in her credibility to take the place of more questioning and more facts			1
these are mistakes i wlll not make again			0
