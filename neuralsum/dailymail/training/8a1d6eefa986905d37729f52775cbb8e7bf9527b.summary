master trainer @entity0 is torn between urging @entity1 to land the first - round knock - out which both believe is possible here or taking his time so as not to scare off @entity6			1
either way @entity0 expects the @entity1 to stop @entity9 ’s @entity8 but there is more at stake in @entity13 ’s sold - out @entity12 than the world welterweight title			1
@entity1 has to win to keep alive the chance of finally meeting @entity6 in what could become a billion dollar super-fight			1
but if he does so in devastating fashion then @entity19 might shy away from jeopardising his unbeaten record			0
@entity0 ( left ) wants @entity1 to set up a showdown with @entity6 @entity1 ( centre ) poses ahead of his world welterweight bout with @entity8 in @entity13 @entity0 wants @entity1 to eventually take on @entity6 ( left ) in what would be a mouthwatering clash @entity0 says : ‘ @entity1 tells me he can ko this guy in one round and i believe him			1
he is back to his best of a few years ago			0
but if he looks sensational we may frighten @entity6 out of fighting us			1
’ to complicate matters even further , @entity1 is overdue a knock - out to reinforce his counter-claim against @entity6 for the mythical title of best pound - for - pound boxer on earth			1
the @entity36 congressman has not stopped an opponent since he sent @entity38 to hospital in @entity40 with sudden , scary ferocity			1
the confidence that he can do so now is not only based on @entity8 ’s comparative inexperience as a late - comer to the prize - ring following a successful kick - boxing career			1
that barren spell as far as @entity47 are concerned has coincided with @entity50 ’s rediscovery of @entity51 and @entity0 was concerned at times by his star pupil ’s apparent reluctance to risk inflicting serious harm upon another human being			1
but now @entity0 says : ‘ the old @entity1 is back			1
’ @entity1 ( right ) walks away after knocking down @entity38 in @entity40 in 2009 @entity1 's last knock out was @entity38 in 2009 - leaving the @entity56 needing hospital treatment @entity0 is unsure if @entity1 ( second right ) should go for a first - round knock against @entity8 @entity1 ( right ) has impressed veteran trainer @entity0 , who believes he will have too much for @entity8 @entity1 ( left ) and @entity8 ( right ) of the @entity59 pose ahead of their world welterweight fight here are the stats ahead of the bout in @entity13 on saturday ( @entity1 first ) : age : 35/30 weight ( probable ) : 10st 4lbs/10st 4lbs height : 5ft 5in/5ft 10in reach : @entity69 chest normal : @entity71 chest expanded : @entity72 biceps : @entity74 forearm : @entity76 waist : @entity77 @entity78 : 20in/21in calf : @entity80 neck : @entity82 wrist : 8in ; 6½in fist : @entity85 record : @entity87 , @entity88 38 , @entity89 , @entity91 / @entity90 , @entity92 8 , @entity93 , @entity94 supporting evidence for that has come in their final work - outs in the gym at the @entity99			1
@entity1 has looked even faster than in his recent fights			2
most significantly , his punches seem to have regained their former snap and power			0
at coming up 36 , he says : ‘ i feel young , like i did in my 20s			0
i ’m hitting harder and , yes , the old aggression is back			0
’ if he is right then for @entity8 , a 30 - year - old medical graduate who plans to become a doctor when he quits the ring , it may be a case on sunday morning of physician , heal thyself			2
@entity1 has agreed to come down three pounds from the welterweight limit for this fight against a light - welter world champion			2
yet , curiously , the undefeated @entity8 is the bigger man			2
most intriguingly he is five inches the taller at 5ft 10in and has a four - inch reach advantage			0
if he stays at a distance behind his left jab it may take @entity1 time to catch up with him			2
@entity1 would prefer him to trade punches - ‘ to simplify my job ’ - but does not expect him to do so			2
@entity8 ( right ) is five inches taller than @entity1 and also has a four - inch reach advantage nor does @entity0 , at least not for long			1
he says : ‘ the first time @entity1 hits him with a left he ’ll run			2
the second time @entity1 hits him with a left , it will be over			2
’ @entity8 sounds ready to heed the warnings saying : ‘ why should i exchange with one of the greatest fighters of all time ? if i can keep away from his punches while scoring with my job , why not ? ’ there speaks a man as sensible as his academic achievements suggest			0
but @entity0 says : ‘ unfortunately for this boy he ’s in over his head			0
and not even the best men @entity1 has fought have been able to stop him getting inside for long			0
his college degrees will not help him here			0
’ @entity1 has said his ' old aggression ' is back ahead of his bout with @entity8 at the weekend @entity1 celebrates his victory over @entity142 in @entity40 in april @entity8 has the courage to put up a fight , as he proved when rising from two first down knock - downs against @entity147 hard - man @entity146 to win his world title over 12 tough rounds			1
but @entity0 points out : ‘ although @entity146 can hit , @entity8 has never been hit by anyone with @entity1 ’s power			1
as for his own punching , he ca n’t crack an egg			0
’ @entity8 , with his blue - eyed good looks of a male model , has the @entity157 girls swooning over him in their thousands here			0
but for my money , shortly after midday sunday local time in the world ’s busiest casino , he is the one likely to fall faint , in the fifth or sixth round			0
@entity164 will be televised live in @entity165 on @entity166 late this saturday night			0
@entity167 ready to fight ' undefeated ' @entity8			0

@entity1 takes on @entity8 in @entity13 on the weekend
@entity0 *undecided* on whether @entity50 should ko @entity8
but @entity1 has not knocked an opponent out since @entity38 in 2009
@entity0 thinks @entity6 is scared of a showdown with @entity1
