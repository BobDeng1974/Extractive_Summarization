here , @entity8 's @entity0 runs the rule over the youngster			0
why are we interested in this young man ? @entity2 played almost the full game as @entity6 began their tour of the @entity15 with a 4 - 1 victory over @entity7			1
he scored a late goal with an accomplished finish and produced an eye - catching performance			1
on the scoresheet : @entity22 ( right ) celebrates his goal against @entity7 on thursday so , how old is he and where did @entity7 find him ? @entity2 is just 17 - years - old and he is a product of the @entity26 in @entity27			1

city have a positive relationship with the set - up and another forward , @entity38 , signed for @entity7 from there in january			1
it seems , then , that @entity7 have great hopes for the young playmaker ? they certainly do			2
he joined the squad on the trip to @entity45 for games against @entity47 and @entity48 and was then invited into @entity50 's 23 - man squad for the tour of the @entity15			2
another @entity3 @entity52 , also went to @entity45			2
bag of tricks : @entity2 slaloms past a couple of @entity57 challenges high hopes : the @entity3 attacking midfielder has been tipped for big things in the future @entity2 sounds like quite a player , then ? at the @entity63 in the @entity64 last year , he scored six goals in seven matches , winning the @entity67 as the second highest goalscorer and the @entity69 as the best player			1

' can we expect to see him in the first - team soon ? possibly not			0
