by @entity0 published : 10:39 est , 3 october 2012 updated : 23:23 est , 3 october 2012 millions of voters will be focusing the presidential candidates and their ' zingers ' tonight in @entity4 , but plenty of attention has already been paid by organizers behind the scenes who have spent much time - and money - setting an even stage for this election 's first presidential debate			1
at 9pm et , president @entity14 and @entity16 rival @entity15 will begin their orchestrated dance of appearing relaxed and candid even though they have been practicing their answers for weeks and timing every response down to the second			1
the debate will last 90 minutes and is being broken up into six 15 minute segments			0
political analysts have speculated that the topic of the attacks on the @entity46 embassy in @entity47 , the @entity14 administration 's handling of the situation , and @entity15 's criticism of their work could potentially be a hot - button topic at the debate , but the first debate is dedicated solely to domestic issues			1
the candidates may insert the issue into one of the more general segments ( most likely the final portion on ' governing ' ) it is not expected to be directly addressed			2
while @entity14 is used to dictating the flow of discussion in the @entity66 and @entity15 touts his executive savvy from his years in the board room , neither will be the one in charge tonight as the reins have been handed over to @entity71			1
mr @entity71 is the former news anchor of @entity72 and known more broadly for his frequent appearances at presidential debates			1
nicknamed the ' @entity76 ' , this will be his 12th time moderating a debate			1
that tally is particularly impressive considering tonight 's show will be the 36th televised presidential debate , meaning that mr @entity71 has been at the helm of one third of all such debates			1
bulking up : @entity14 delivered pizzas to volunteers tuesday night in @entity86 ( left ) while @entity15 ordered a burrito bowl at @entity88 in @entity4 ( right ) even though the title may be impressive , that does n't mean that he ever wanted to earn it : after moderating one of the debates between @entity14 and his then - rival senator @entity94 in the 2008 election , mr @entity71 wrote a book about his two - decades in the moderating business and swore that he would not commit to any more			1
for a man known for his sterling reputation and reliability , he made the unusual move of reversing his decision after the @entity103 asked him to return to the chair to kick off the first of this year 's three debates			0
' i did say that and i meant that , with every bit of firmness i could muster , ' mr @entity71 told @entity111 referring to his vow not to moderate again			0
' but i also have said that people who are invited to moderate these events -- you have to d it			0
it 's almost like getting a draft notice			0
' master moderator : @entity71 ( right ) will be serving as the debate orchestrator , and this will be his 13th time hosting a presidential debate			1
his most recent moderating came in the 2008 debate between @entity14 ( center ) and @entity94 ( left ) mr @entity71 will begin each of the six segments by asking a question and both of the candidates will be given two minutes to answer			1
from there , the time will be spent having a conversation on the issue , with mr @entity71 interjecting to steer the discussion or cut - off excessively - long answers			2
the 78 - year - old is known for being fair but firm , to both the candidates and to the audience			2
@entity111 quotes his 2008 memoir on his moderating career , titled @entity144 , as saying that while things may get heated on stage , the audience should stay cool and ' they are expected to remain absolutely silent during a debate			2
' ' they are invited guests , not participants			0
the moderator should remind the would - be cheerleaders and boobirds of the rules and enforce them when necessary , ' he wrote			0
in addition to the thousands of people who will be on the @entity162 campus and be filling the @entity163 , 60million people are expected to tune in at home			0
posing the questions : seen here with then - candidate @entity167 ( left ) , @entity71 ( right ) will open each segment with a question , let the candidates answer , and then proceed to steer a conversation for the remaining 11 minutes the preliminary headcount puts tonight 's debate at a fairly standard level , as @entity175 reports that the size of the television audience for the three 2008 debates ranged from 52.4million to 63.2million			1
one possible explanation for why analysts are n't predicting a higher headcount is because many voters are already rife with campaign fatigue : during the @entity16 primary , there were 20 televised debates between the ever - changing cast of candidates			2
regardless , tonight is pegged as the most important night - to - date in the seemingly endless campaign , since this is the first time that the two candidates will go at it face to face , as opposed to in the 30 - second safety net of their scripted attack ads. adding to the competition of the night , @entity195 is a battleground state for the two men , as @entity198 reports that the president only holds a 3.1 per cent lead over @entity15 in the @entity201			1
that marks a sharp difference from 2008 , when @entity14 carried the state with 9 per cent more of the vote than @entity94			0
the @entity162 is predictably pleased about their selection because the windfall of campaign staffers , political reporters and analysts means big business for the school			0
the @entity213 suggests that while it cost the university more than $ 1.6million to host the event , school administrators feel they can expect $ 20 - 30million in profits			0
they will meet again two more times , with the second debate coming in @entity220 , @entity221 on the 16th and their final showdown on the 22nd in @entity223 , @entity224			0
traditionally considered a toothless fight , this year ’s vice presidential debate is hotly - anticipated because of @entity15 ’s selection of congressman @entity228			1
the 42 - year - old will face vice president @entity230 on october 11 in @entity231 , @entity232			0
nicknamed the ' @entity76 ' , this will be @entity71 's 12th time moderating a debate and considering tonight 's show will be the 36th televised presidential debate in @entity46 history , meaning that mr @entity71 has been at the helm of one third of all such debates			1
after moderating one of the debates between @entity14 and his then - rival senator @entity94 in the 2008 election , mr @entity71 wrote a book about his two - decades in the moderating business and swore that he would not commit to any more			1
the 78 - year - old is known for being fair but firm , to both the candidates and to the audience			2
in his book , @entity71 wrote that he feels the audience ' are invited guests , not participants			2
the moderator should remind the would - be cheerleaders and boobirds of the rules and enforce them when necessary			0
' the television audience is expected to rank in at around 60million people , which is on the high end of a typical debate headcount			2
the size of the television audience for the three 2008 debates ranged from 52.4million to 63.2million			0
all three of those debates were bested by the showdown between @entity230 and @entity269 , whose performance at the vice presidential debate garnered 69.9million viewers			1
in spite of heated campaign rhetoric over the @entity14 administration 's handling of the attacks on the @entity46 embassy in @entity47 , the topic may not be specifically addressed on wednesday because the debate is focused on domestic issues			1
that said , political analysts expect for the issue to be raised at some point by either @entity15 or @entity14			2
the debate will last 90 minutes and is being broken up into six 15 minute segments			0
the focus of the first three segments are dedicated to the economy ( creatively titled @entity35 ) before they move on to health care in the fourth segment , ' the role of government ' in the fifth , and concluding on the issue of ' governing '			0
@entity14 and @entity15 will meet again two more times , with the second debate coming in @entity220 , @entity221 on the 16th and their final showdown on the 22nd in @entity223 , @entity224			1
@entity195 is a battleground state for the two men , as the president only holds a 3.1 per cent lead over @entity15 in the @entity201			0
that marks a sharp difference from 2008 , when @entity14 carried the state with 9 per cent more of the vote than @entity94			0
the cost of hosting the event is expected to total more than $ 1.6million to host the event , but because of the thousands of visitors that come with the debate , school administrators feel they can expect $ 20 - 30million in profits .			2

@entity14 and @entity15 go head - to - head at 9pm et in first presidential debate
will be @entity71 's 12th time moderating a debate , earning him the title of hosting one - third of all televised presidential debates
wednesday night 's debate is first of three for candidates before election
