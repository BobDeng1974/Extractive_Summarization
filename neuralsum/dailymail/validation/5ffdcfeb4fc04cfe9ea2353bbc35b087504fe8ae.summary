@entity0 has confirmed that it is dropping the @entity2 brand			1
the move was rumoured in december but now the @entity5 - based tech giant has said it will use a new name for its forthcoming browser , which is currently code named @entity8			1
it is believed the new browser will look more like @entity13 's @entity12 browser and be faster than @entity2			1
‘ we ’ll continue to have @entity2 , but we ’ll also have a new browser which is code named @entity8			2
we have to name the thing , ’ he said at @entity24			0
the new browser will be the main way for @entity0 10 users to access the internet , although @entity2 will continue to exist , @entity27 reported			1
the re-branding move is unsurprising as @entity0 has tried and largely failed to shake off the bad reputation of @entity32 , which was notoriously insecure and has regularly made ‘ worst tech products of all time ’ lists			1
the browser , which does not yet have a name , is likely to be rolled out with @entity23 10			2
the new operating system marks the return of the @entity40 , which has the traditional list layout of previous versions of the interface , combined with the tile set - up that @entity0 introduced in @entity45 ( pictured ) the company is thought to be testing names using market research , but so far no final name has been announced			1

internet explorer was one of the most widely used web browsers , attaining a peak of about 95 per cent during 2002 and 2003			2
however , it struggled in the face of competition , and in may 2012 it was announced that @entity13 's @entity12 overtook @entity2 as the most used browser worldwide			1
the brand has struggled to shake off the bad reputation of internet explorer 6 , which was notoriously insecure			0
@entity19 mentioned that putting ‘ @entity0 ’ in front of the secret name boosted the browser ’s appeal to some @entity12 users in the @entity70 , suggesting the company ’s name could appear in the final brand			1
@entity74 of @entity75 first shared the rumour of a new browser in december			2
' @entity0 is building a new browser , codenamed @entity8 , which is not @entity79 12 - at least according to a couple of sources of mine , ' she wrote			1
@entity83 , a @entity85 lead and developer of the modern version of @entity88 - a media playing app - claimed on @entity90 in december that he heard @entity0 was building a brand - new browser			1
' however , if my sources are right , @entity8 is not @entity79 12			1
' instead , @entity8 is a new , light - weight browser @entity0 is building			1
' it is believed @entity23 10 will ship with both @entity8 and @entity79 to ensure compatibility with all web sites			1
@entity0 has not publicly set a firm timetable for the release of @entity23			1
internet explorer , which was first called @entity2 , was first released as part of the add - on package plus ! for @entity53 in 1995 , but since then it has gained a lacklustre reputation			2

' @entity23 is at a threshold and now it 's time for a new @entity23			0
' our new @entity23 must be built from the ground up for a mobile first , cloud first world			0
' it would n't be right to call it @entity23 9			0
' @entity0 said its new operating system will run on the ' broadest types of devices ever ' and will see various app stores merged into one platform , called the one store			1
last year , @entity132 , @entity0 's @entity23 chief , explained how @entity23 10 will work on everything from a desktop computer to a smartphone - and even the firm 's @entity155 games console the new software will also allow users on hybrid devices like the @entity161 tablet to jump between and keyboard and touchscreen modes ( pictured ) the new @entity40 has the traditional list layout of previous versions of the interface , combined with the tile set - up that @entity0 introduced in @entity45			1

in addition to offering a list of a user 's favourite applications , the menu brings up re-sizable tiles - similar to those featured in @entity45 's touch - centric interface - on pcs and tablets			2
the current version , @entity23 8 , has been widely derided for forcing radical behavioral changes			0
@entity0 is restoring some of the more traditional ways of doing things and promises that @entity23 will be familiar for users regardless of which version of @entity23 they are now using			1
' @entity23 will deliver the right experience , at the right time			0
' @entity23 will be our most comprehensive platform , ever , ' said mr @entity132			0

many see the upgrade as being the first steps towards righting the unpopular changes made in the company 's previous desktop software , @entity23 8 , and that is reflected in industry reaction			1
@entity233 , founder of technology website @entity234 said : ' the initial reaction is that @entity0 had introduced some really good features that will appeal to many and fix many of the annoyances of @entity45			2
' it looks like they are doing everything they can to make amends for the mistakes of @entity45 , but with a long lead time and many unanswered questions like release and price , there is still much left to learn			0
' that said it looks to be a good move from the @entity5 based company and one that will benefit many			0
' @entity256 of technology analysts @entity258 also noted the need for @entity0 to regain support after @entity45			2
' @entity23 is the product of a difficult @entity45 launch and a process of refinement based on vocal user feedback			0
@entity0 will hope that this marks a fresh start that will convince developers , enterprise and consumers of its one @entity23 strategy ' , he said			2
' with @entity23 10 @entity0 has re-evaluated its approach to software releases by adopting a web mentality that dovetails with the @entity275 first , mobile first vision under @entity277			1
this open , collaborative approach is critical if @entity0 is to overcome the wave of negative sentiment that has plagued @entity23 8 since launch			1
' the unveiling of @entity23 is notable for its emphasis on enterprise			0
this dialling up of corporate versus consumer functionality is much needed not least because enterprise replacements are driving @entity289 market growth			0
' developers are the lifeblood of any platform so it is critical that @entity0 's ' one @entity23 ' mantra delvers on the promise and re-energises developer engagement			1
' @entity23 10 is designed to bring together all of @entity0 's different hardware , such as a the surface tablet ( left ) and the @entity155 ( right ) under the same software across desktop pcs as a whole , only 13.4 per cent currently run @entity23 8 or @entity303 8.1 , according to research firm @entity304			1

the start menu in @entity23 will appear similar to what 's found in @entity306 , but tiles opening to the side will resemble what 's found in @entity45			0
@entity168 , a @entity0 executive who oversees @entity23 design and evolution , said @entity23 10 will offer ' the familiarity of @entity306 with some of the benefits that exist in @entity45 ' to help business users make the transition			2

' he said that going from @entity45 to @entity23 is like going from a @entity329 to a @entity330			0
' they do n't have to learn any new way to drive			0
' mr @entity168 also confirmed that @entity23 10 would be compatible with both traditional and touch - based device users like tablets through a new task view with buttons scaled up so that they 're more friendly to those on touchscreen devices			2
users on hybrid devices like the @entity161 tablet will be able to jump between and keyboard and touchscreen modes , with @entity0 demonstrating how the interface will change as you do			1
