and yes , if the recovery is sustained then families will start to feel better off			0

‘ but family finances will not be transformed overnight			1
because @entity4 was made much poorer by the crash			0
‘ that is what happens when you get a catastrophic failure of economic policy of the kind we saw five years ago the result of a decade of @entity11 failure when bust follows boom when banks get bailed out and when government budgets spiral out of control			1
’ he added : ‘ this battle to turn around @entity4 it is not even close to being over			0
and we are going to finish what we have started			0
there can be no recovery for all if there is no recovery at all			0
’ he accused @entity11 of allowing people to linger on benefits for years – with no questions asked – while letting uncontrolled numbers of migrants fill low - paid jobs			1
the ‘ help to work ’ scheme – quickly dubbed ‘ made to work ’ – is likely to face furious opposition from left - wing activists and charities			1
but mr @entity2 told @entity8 delegates : ‘ for the first time , all long - term unemployed people who are capable of work will be required to do something in return for their benefits to help them find work			1
‘ they will do useful work to put something back into their community – making meals for the elderly , clearing up litter , working for a local charity			2
others will be made to attend the job centre every working day			0
‘ and for those with underlying problems , like drug addiction and illiteracy , there will be an intensive regime of help			0

mr @entity2 said : ‘ by the time @entity11 left office , five million people were on out - of - work benefits			1
' what a waste of life and talent			0
a generation of people recycled through the job centres – collecting their dole cheques year in year out , and no one seemed to notice			2
' for an open - door immigration policy meant those running the economy did n’t care : there was always a ready supply of low - skilled labour from abroad			0
’ the chancellor argued that , under @entity11 ’s welfare system , people were better off on benefits than in work and nothing was asked for in return for handouts			1
but @entity305 , @entity11 ’s @entity306 spokesman , said : ‘ it ’s taken three wasted years of rising long - term unemployment and a failed @entity309 to come up with this new scheme			1
‘ but this policy is not as ambitious as @entity11 ’s compulsory jobs guarantee , which would ensure there is a paid job for every young person out of work for over 12 months and every adult unemployed for more than two years			1
‘ with @entity11 ’s plans we would work with employers to ensure there are jobs for young people and the long - term unemployed – which they would have to take up or lose benefits			1
' under the @entity8 scheme people would still be allowed to languish on the dole for years on end without having a proper job			1

no rise in fuel duty before election if savings can be found
