by @entity0 @entity2 authorities have confirmed the first two cases of a painful mosquito - borne disease contracted in the @entity5			1
state health officials confirmed a @entity8 female and a male in @entity10 have become the first two people to contract chikungya in the @entity5			2
dozens of infections have previously been reported in @entity2 alone , according to the @entity15 , but these are the first two to have been contracted in the @entity5			1
started complaining of symptoms june 10 , according to the @entity22 , and the 50 - year - old male from @entity10 first reported his symptoms on july 1			0
neither had travelled outside the country , sources told the @entity22			0
the disease is rarely fatal , and is often more of a discomfort			2
it is transmitted when a mosquito bites an infected person and then bites an uninfected person			1
it can not be transmitted directly from human to human			1
symptoms include fever , severe joint pain , swelling , rashes , and a feeling similar to arthritis for years , according to the @entity22			1
previous cases of the disease were the result of travelers having been bitten by infected mosquitoes in the @entity49 , where it is highly - prevalent			1
it was only a matter of time until it made the jump to @entity2			1
now the question is what are the cases to follow and can @entity59 itself do something to mitigate whatever those numbers might be ? ’ @entity63 , director of the @entity65 's @entity64 , told the @entity22			0
preventive measures : officials are stepping up the spraying of mosquito - prone areas to reduce their populations ‘ it ’s not clear yet , how many more cases are there to follow in addition to these initial cases , ’ he explained another official told the paper counties will now be spraying more often for mosquitoes			2
‘ we ’re trying to put in our plan on how to be a little more proactive with our spraying , ’ @entity8 ’s @entity82 chief @entity81 said			0
‘ we do n’t want to set a concrete plan ; we have to come up with an adjustable plan based on the mosquitoes , and adjust the plan routinely			0
’ authorities expect more people who became sick from an infected mosquito to eventually come forward , but do not expect a full - on outbreak or epidemic like it has become in some parts of the @entity49			0
reports say thousands of cases have been reported in the @entity97			0
it has been declared an epidemic in @entity100 , where 121 cases have been confirmed , according to the @entity102			2
property owners in @entity2 are being encouraged to drain standing water , seal screens and windows , and cover up while outside since the infected insects can bite during both the day and night			1
the only treatment for chikungunya is acetaminophen and water			0
taking aspirin is specifically discouraged because the disease does not react well to it .			0

the disease is passed from human to human by infected mosquitoes the same way *malaria* and *dengue* fever are transmitted
it causes severe pain , rashes , swelling , *nausea* and can last for weeks or even years
