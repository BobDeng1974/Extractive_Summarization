@entity1 leader @entity0 has urged muslims to launch attacks on ' @entity5 soil ' to lead up to a ' war on its own land '			1
in an audio speech released online a day after the twelfth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks , @entity0 urged sustained attacks on the @entity5 which he said would ' bleed @entity5 economically ' by forcing the country to spend large amounts on defence			1
and he encouraged @entity2 to seize any opportunity to land ' a large strike ' on the @entity5 even if this took years of patience , according to a translation on the @entity20 monitoring service			1
@entity0 , who was @entity36 's physician and right - hand man and tops @entity5 's list of ' most wanted ' terrorists released in 2001 with a £ 15million bounty on his head , is credited by many as having been the brains behind the 9/11 attacks and those on the @entity48 transport system in july 2005 that left 52 people dead			1
western counter-terrorism chiefs have warned that the broadcast could provide fuel for radicalised ' lone wolves ' who might have had no direct contact with @entity1 as much as operatives like those who carried out complex plots like the september 11 strikes			0
nearly 3,000 people were killed in the attacks in 2001 when hijacked aeroplanes were flown into @entity65 's @entity64 , the @entity66 in @entity67 and a @entity69 field			0
@entity0 was quoted as saying in the speech : ' we should bleed @entity5 economically by provoking it to continue in its massive expenditure on its security , for the weak point of @entity5 is its economy , which has already begun to stagger due to the military and security expenditure			0
' right - hand man : @entity79 , pictured left with @entity36 in 2002 keeping the @entity5 in such a state of tension and anticipation only required a few disparate attacks ' here and there ' , he said ' as we defeated it in the gang warfare in @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 , so we should follow it with ... war on its own land			1
these disparate strikes can be done by one brother or a few of the brothers			0
' in his audio speech , @entity0 said @entity2 should refuse to buy goods from @entity5 and its allies , as such spending only helped to fund @entity5 military action in @entity2 lands			1
he added that @entity2 should abandon the @entity5 dollar and replace it with the currency of nations that did not attack @entity2			2
@entity0 spoke approvingly of the bombing of the @entity109 in april , in which three people were killed and 264 injured , and which @entity5 authorities believe was carried out by two ethnic @entity115 brothers			2
dangerous : the @entity1 leader tops the @entity5 most wanted list with a £ 15million bounty on his head @entity0 described the bombing as part of @entity1 's violent transnational campaign of jihad , or holy war , against @entity5 interests			0
' the @entity127 incident confirms to the @entity5 ... that they are not facing individuals , organizations or groups , but they are facing an uprising @entity132 ( @entity132 ) , that rose in jihad to defend its soul , dignity and capabilities , ' he said			0
' what the @entity5 regime refuses to admit is that @entity1 is a message before it was an organization			0
' @entity0 , suspected by many security specialists to be living in the @entity142 - @entity92 border area , added that @entity1 's message to @entity2 was that they had to defend their dignity if they wanted to be liberated ' .			2
