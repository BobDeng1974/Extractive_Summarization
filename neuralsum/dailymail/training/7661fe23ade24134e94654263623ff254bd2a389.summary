by @entity0 it was a conflict which would engulf millions of lives , end empires and change the face of the world - and war itself - forever			1
one hundred years ago yesterday the first shots rang out of what would later be called the @entity10 - though at the time it would have been hard to predict that the conflict between the @entity13 and @entity14 would spread like wildfire across @entity16 and beyond			1
armies of the great powers - the @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 - had been swelling their armed forces , still made up of cavalry units and gleaming bright uniforms , for years			1
but a new era of trenches , artillery and machine - guns would consign these relics to the past as fighting men from across the globe dug in for years of protracted combat which would also see the birth of chemical weapons , tanks and fighter planes			2
as these evocative archive pictures show , the @entity10 took a bleak and heavy toll from the lands it touched , both on its landscape , settlements and - most of all - the fighters who never returned or came back scarred and crippled , who are still remembered today			0
here @entity19 @entity68 soldiers bunker down during the first @entity69 blasted to smithereens : a pensive soldier stands in the ruins of a religious building in @entity74 , @entity21 , which was a heavily - contested battlefield waste and ruin : pictured above are food stores deliberately burned to the ground			0
the @entity10 impacted the lives of civilians directly and painfully poignant : a rifle and a helmet are the only memorial which can be seen to a @entity21 soldier who died in the trenches at @entity74 shelling : the war was dominated by artillery fire , which battered towns and trenches for years on end			1
@entity91 is pictured a @entity20 howitzer firing on @entity93 war effort : pictured are women at a munitions factory in @entity97 , @entity98 , producing shells for artillery batteries on the front lines swamped : soldiers spent years manning a network of trenches which snaked across @entity16			2
pictured above is an abandoned trench at @entity106 in @entity107 war in the skies : fighter planes were deployed for the first time during the war			0
above a dogfight can be seen between fighters branded with the @entity116 logo and members of the @entity20 @entity118 over the top : pictured above are @entity19 soldiers leaping over a trench with bayonet rifles as they charge towards their enemy - probably lying in wait with machine guns			0

one hundred years ago today first shots were fired as @entity13 *declared* war on @entity14
conflict would engulf all major world powers , consume millions of lives and change the world forever
