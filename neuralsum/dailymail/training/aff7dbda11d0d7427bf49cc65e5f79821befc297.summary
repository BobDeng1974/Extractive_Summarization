the @entity0 are in the process of renewing a contract with bookmakers @entity3 despite the considerable conflict of interest because of the blanket ban on gambling for anyone working in @entity10 football			1
@entity3 were controversial £ 2.5million - a - year sponsors of @entity12 and the @entity13 when the deal was first signed in 2012 because of the regulations against footballers betting which have now been extended to worldwide restrictions on the whole football family			2
yet the @entity0 , who rule on gambling breaches , still intend to keep an official betting partner , with @entity3 close to agreeing a new four - year deal for the next @entity25 cycle			1
woeful : @entity12 's disastrous @entity25 has seen their sponsorship deal with @entity3 slashed however , the deal will be considerably less — around £ 1.5m annually — because the @entity0 are in a weak negotiating position after such a woeful @entity25 performance and players ’ appearances being taken out of the rights because of the gambling implications			1
@entity3 are also having to save significant amounts because of a new law which obliges them — along with other betting companies — to pay @entity40 tax on their off - shore earnings which will cost them around £ 70m a year			0
the @entity0 say a close relationship with a bookmaker helps them monitor illegal betting			0
but the new agreement has still to be rubber - stamped by the @entity0 and @entity3 boards			2
the upheaval at @entity49 includes ambitious chief scout @entity50 leaving @entity51 to join @entity53 club @entity52 , who have revamped their recruitment operation			1
it is understood @entity50 was looking for more day - to - day involvement than he was given under @entity58			0
@entity50 , 28 , was the youngest chief scout in the @entity61 last season and combined those duties with qualifying to be a solicitor			1
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... there is plenty of surprise within @entity68 that lead football analyst @entity69 has been granted extended leave since the @entity25 — missing the start of the season and is not due back until august 30			1
@entity69 was said to be exhausted after his stint in @entity73 , but has since had @entity75 rows with @entity76 and his @entity68 colleague @entity77			2
and , far from resting , @entity69 is actually in @entity78 working for @entity79			0
moonlighting ? @entity69 has been working in @entity78 after taking an extended break from @entity68 in the unlikely event of @entity82 surviving as @entity84 head coach after the dismal way his team capitulated against @entity12 , he certainly wo n’t be able to name his own lucrative terms again			1
these included being excused all media duties other than one pre-series press conference that took place at @entity92			0
however , the taciturn @entity82 has still managed to demonstrate with his actions this summer — notably during the @entity94 won by @entity84 — how bitter he still remains at being sacked as @entity12 coach after the @entity96 and @entity25 demise in 2005 - 06			2
on his way ? @entity82 is unlikely to keep his job after @entity84 's @entity94 capitulation against @entity12 video coach @entity101 praises ' outstanding ' @entity12 @entity102 double booking publishers @entity104 , who mounted a military - style security operation around the launch of sir @entity102 ’s autobiography last october , were unaware on tuesday that the unveiling of the paperback edition , with two added chapters , 12 months on will clash with another book trading off @entity102 ’s name			1
@entity114 are bringing out how to think like sir @entity102 : the business of winning and managing success , by sports psychologist professor @entity117 , who says he is drawing on his ‘ first - hand experiences of working with @entity102 ’			0
double trouble : @entity102 's second book launch is set to clash with another title bearing his name @entity124 are desperate for @entity126 @entity125 to speak out about their being starved of funding by @entity130 ’s zero tolerance towards those without olympic medal potential			1
and time is running out for the @entity40 women ’s team , who could still qualify for @entity137			0
performance chief @entity138 requested a meeting with @entity140 in june and was told october was the earliest she could see him			0
a @entity143 spokesman said that timescale was not unusual with party conferences following the summer recess			0
