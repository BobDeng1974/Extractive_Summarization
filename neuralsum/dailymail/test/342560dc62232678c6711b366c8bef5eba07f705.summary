an experiment on the @entity1 will investigate whether plants are able to use a sixth sense while in space - a sense of gravity			1
in the weightless environment of the space station , researchers will monitor how plants grow in a particular direction without a noticeable gravitational pull			1
the results could help farmers on @entity15 get a higher crop yield - and may also help future astronauts grow plants on missions beyond @entity15 orbit to the moon and @entity22			1
an experiment on the @entity1 will investigate whether plants are able to use a sixth sense while in space - a sense of gravity			1
@entity30 astronaut @entity29 is pictured harvesting plants from a previous @entity32 ( @entity32 ) investigation of thale cress during @entity35 in 2013 the experiment is being run by researchers at the @entity32 ( @entity32 )			2
@entity39 researchers are currently testing a greenhouse system , which uses recycled urine to manufacture fertiliser			0
they hope to build a greenhouse in @entity44 to test the first space garden in 2016			0
the system is being developed at the @entity47 in @entity48 , and is called @entity49 ( @entity50 and @entity52 - closed nutrition sources )			0
funded by @entity53 , the greenhouses will contain combined life - support systems which use recycled urine to manufacture fertiliser , helping to grow vegetables for a lunar and @entity22 environment			1
scientists from @entity61 are also hoping to use meteorite soil to grow everything from asparagus to potatoes			0
if the study proves successful , it could help humans grow their own food in space , helping in the quest to colonise other planets			0
called the @entity75 study , it will be conducted when new supplies are taken to the @entity1 by a @entity77 on 13 april			2
the experiment will examine the cellular process of formation in thale cress , a small flowering plant related to cabbage			0
small dishes will hold seedlings , and astronauts on the station will watch how they are able to grow inside the @entity89 kibo module			1
scientists will be examining whether a plant ’s ability to work out which way it is growing - the gravity sensor - can form in the absence of gravity			2
it should be noted that there is still gravity on the iss but , owing to its orbit around @entity15 , things on the station are in a constant state of free - fall , simulating a zero - gravity environment			1
in the kibo module , the plants will be placed in both the micro gravity iss environment and in a small centrifuge , that can simulate @entity15 ’s gravity			2
results will show if the plants can sense changes in gravity , and adapt levels of calcium in their cells to compensate for it			2
the results could help farmers on @entity15 get a higher crop yield - and may also help future astronauts grow plants on missions beyond @entity15 orbit to the moon and @entity22 ( illustration shown ) in particular , scientists think particles in plant cells that store and process starch for energy - amyloplast - may form in the direction of gravitational pull			1
by increasing calcium concentrations , the amyloplast can help the plant grow in a certain direction			0
without gravity , though , scientists will be keen to see whether the same components can still assemble to make the plant grow in a certain direction			0
if the role of amyloplast is proven to be correct , it could mean that plants on @entity15 could be modified to make them more healthy			2
and it could also help cultivate healthy plants for consumption on future deep space missions , or even other planets			0
these culture dishes hold seedlings and the growing medium for the @entity75 investigation , which were used during astronaut training at the @entity32 ’s @entity161 in march 2014 the gravity sensor of the plant could be regulated to account for the different gravity on another planet - such as @entity22 , where it is a third of @entity15 ’s			1
‘ we may design plants that respond to gravity vector changes more efficiently than wild ones , ’ said dr @entity167 from the @entity168 in @entity89 , who is running the experiment			1
‘ these plants will recover from collapse by winds or flood more rapidly than wild ones			0
thus , the agricultural output of the designed plants will be greatly increased , which may solve , in part , the shortage of crops in the near future			0

@entity89 - led experiment will see how plants grow on the @entity1
researchers will monitor how they grow without influence of gravity
results could help farmers on @entity15 get a higher crop yield
and it may also help future astronauts grow plants on @entity22
