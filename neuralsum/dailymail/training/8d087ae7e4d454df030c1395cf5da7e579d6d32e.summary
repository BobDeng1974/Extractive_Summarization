the ‘ miracle pine ’ that survived the 2011 tsunami in @entity7 will be immortalised as a monument to the victims of the disaster as the nation marks the second anniversary today			1
the 88ft pine was the only surviving tree in a forest of 70,000 which was wiped out when the tsunami hit @entity12 , @entity14 prefecture			1
the disaster on march 11 , 2011 , left nearly 19,000 people dead or missing and more than 300,000 without a home , and many have yet to return			1
in memoriam : the ' miracle pine ' pictured today after it has been artificially restored as a monument marking the anniversary of the 2011 tsunami in @entity12 , @entity14 the pine tree , which also survived major tsunami in 1896 and 1933 , died six months ago as a result of the environmental changes in the area			1
the ‘ miracle pine ’ was felled soon afterwards and giant moulds were made in order to re-create the tree and raise the monument on the spot where it stood for 173 years			1
as @entity7 marked the second anniversary of the devastating earthquake and tsunami , it emerged that thousands of families remain displaced			1
there is growing dissatisfaction in the island nation as the population accuse the government of not putting enough effort into the recovery process			0
about half of those displaced are evacuees from areas near the nuclear @entity53 nuclear plant , whose reactors melted down after its cooling systems were disabled by the tsunami			2
i 'm a survivor : the tree was the only to still stand in a forest where an estimated 70,000 stood before the tsunami moved on the small city and nearly wiped it off the map building memories : after the tree died it was cut up and partly re-created in order to create the monument pining for the past : as @entity7 marks the second anniversary of the disaster , the tree is one of the few things which has been fully restored in the aftermath of the tsunami all by myself : what used to be a forest is now a beach with a lone tree , a large part of which is ' fake ' as the real deal died six months ago as a result of the increased levels of saline in the ground made of stronger stuff : the tree was 173 years old before it died , 18 months after the disaster - which was the third tsunami it had survived today 800 of them filed a lawsuit demanding compensation from the government and the now - defunct plant 's operator , @entity95 ( @entity95 ) , for their suffering and losses			1
‘ two years after the disasters , neither the government nor @entity95 has clearly acknowledged their responsibility , nor have they provided sufficient support to cover the damages , ’ said @entity99 , a lawyer representing the plaintiffs			0
@entity7 ’s new prime minister @entity106 said that the government intends to make ‘ visible ’ reconstruction progress and accelerate resettlement of those left homeless by streamlining legal and administrative procedures many blame for the delays			1
‘ i pray that the peaceful lives of those affected can resume as soon as possible , ’ @entity114 said at a somber memorial service at @entity117 's @entity116 earlier today			0
before : this aerial view show @entity123 , @entity122 prefecture on march 12 , 2011 , the day after the tsunam , and at left is the no. 18 @entity127 fishing vessel which was swept away from a nearby port after : @entity123 , @entity122 prefecture pictured on march 4 , 2013 ¿ the fishing vessel remains but the debris has been cleared before : a man takes a photograph of of @entity133 , @entity122 prefecture a week after the earthquake and the tsunami that followed after : two years later the area has been cleaned of debris , and the land is ready to be rebuilt at observances in @entity117 and in still barren towns along the northeastern coast , those gathered bowed their heads in a moment of silence marking the moment , at 2:46 p.m. on march 11 , 2011 , when the magnitude 9.0 earthquake - the strongest recorded in @entity7 's history - struck off the coast			1
throughout the disaster zone , the tens of thousands of survivors living in temporary housing are impatient to get resettled , a process that could take up to a decade , officials say			2
‘ what i really want is to once again have a " my home , " ‘ said @entity154 , a 69 - year - old farm worker in @entity12 , who lost his son and the house he had just finished building in the disaster			2
further south , in @entity53 prefecture , some 160,000 evacuees are uncertain if they will ever be able to return to homes around the nuclear power plant , where the meltdowns in three reactors spewed radiation into the surrounding soil and water			0
evacuees are anxious to return home but worried about the potential , still uncertain risks from exposure to the radiation from the disaster , the worst since @entity174 in 1986			2
while there have been no clear cases of cancer linked to radiation from the plant , the upheaval in people 's lives , uncertainty about the future and long - term health concerns , especially for children , have taken an immense psychological toll on thousands of residents			0
devastating : the tsunami floods over the breakwater protecting the northwestern coastal city of @entity192 on march 11 , 2011 still in pain : as the country marks two years since the tsunami , many in @entity7 are complaining that the restoration work is too slow and many have yet to return to their homes ‘ i do n't trust the government on anything related to health anymore , ’ said @entity200 , 42 , who fled the nearby town of @entity202 and does n't plan to return			2
a change of government late last year has raised hopes that authorities might move more quickly with the cleanup and reconstruction			0
since taking office in late december , @entity106 has made a point of frequently visiting the disaster zone , promising faster action and plans to raise the long - term reconstruction budget to 25 trillion yen ( £ 175 billion ) from 19 trillion yen ( £ 134 billion )			0
‘ we can not turn away from the harsh reality of the affected areas			0
the @entity221 still is an ongoing event , ’ @entity106 said at the memorial gathering in @entity117			0
‘ many of those hit by the disaster are still facing uncertainty over their futures			0
