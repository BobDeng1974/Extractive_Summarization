the @entity0 and @entity1 have been warned the number of away fans attending evening games will begin to dwindle unless action is taken , as it emerged that not one of december ’s rearranged fixtures for @entity8 is possible to get back from via public transport			1
four games have been moved to 8pm kick - offs on a monday but travelling supporters from @entity13 , @entity14 , and @entity15 will not be able to use trains to return home at full - time unless they stay over until the next morning			1
@entity20 , chair of the @entity21 , criticised the @entity0 and @entity1 over the scheduling and revealed his group had pressed the broadcaster on the issue earlier this year and would be doing so again in light of developments			1
@entity28 vs @entity15 at @entity29 is one of the games which has been moved to monday night for @entity1 chair of the @entity33 @entity20 thinks it could see attendances drop the four matches concerned are @entity43 ’s trip to @entity44 on december 8 , @entity38 facing @entity39 at @entity40 a week later , @entity36 visiting @entity37 on december 22 , and @entity15 taking on @entity28 at @entity29 two days before @entity45			1
@entity46 , chair of @entity47 , said there was ‘ sufficient evidence to suggest travelling fans are not really considered when the fixtures are changed ’			1
there was also a backlash on @entity54 , with @entity36 fan @entity56 writing : ‘ @entity37 away moved to a monday night , 3 days before @entity57			2
thank you very much @entity1 , always putting the fans first ...			1
’ @entity60 , a @entity43 supporter , posted : ‘ @entity44 away 8pm on a monday night			0
consideration given to travelling fans there eh @entity1 ? ’ @entity43 supporter @entity60 was less than complimentary his team will travel to take on @entity44 on a monday night , presenting a transport conundrum for fans @entity1 and the @entity0 insist away crowds are factored into discussions but stressed that the complicated formula for compiling fixture lists made it difficult for televised evening games to always allow public transport			1
any games changed for television purposes are announced six weeks in advance to allow time for plans to be made			0
there is also a £ 200,000 pot available to each club to help travelling fans , which @entity36 partly used for their monday night game at @entity84 to put on return coaches and trains for just £ 10			2
@entity43 ’s £ 200,000 allocation has however already been allocated by cutting every away ticket by £ 5 per fan per match			0
however , @entity20 believes that ultimately fewer supporters will show up to matches if the organisers continue to make it impracticable on public routes			2
‘ we did actually meet @entity1 some months ago and made the point about the need to consider away supporters and so it will disappointing if we do n’t see some improvement in that , if the problem still persists , ’ he told @entity95			2
@entity36 play @entity37 on a monday three days before @entity57 - and wo n't be able to return on public transport @entity38 's trip to @entity39 in december is one of many to be criticised after being moved to a monday night ‘ it ’s in everybody ’s interests that there is a vibrant away support because the atmosphere is one of the things that makes it an attractive television product			1
if you have a half - empty away end because supporters ca n’t get back home – they ’ ve decided to watch it in the local pub instead – that ’s not in the long - term interests of the @entity0 , @entity1 , or the match - going supporters			1
‘ we accept it ’s a complex business but nevertheless we think that the interests of away supporters should be fairly high up on the list of criteria when games are chosen to switch			0
‘ the big danger for the football industry is that fans will simply say , “ i won ’ t go			0
” i ’ve no doubt we will seek a follow - up meeting with @entity1 to review what ’ s happened and take up some of these issues			1
’ on @entity15 ’s match at @entity28 , some 300 miles away on an eight hour round - trip , @entity46 said some supporters would be deterred from travelling on a monday night			1
‘ the difficulty is getting back from the game , ’ he said			0
‘ even the official transport that goes up will probably be getting home in the early hours of the morning			0
‘ the bottom line is that a lot of fans who would have gone to a three o’clock saturday match will not now travel			0
hopefully there will still be a good following			0
‘ there are sufficient examples to suggest travelling fans are not really considered when the fixtures are changed			2
i recall a match two seasons ago where we played @entity161 away on a tuesday night			0
‘ it ’s unfortunate because people try to get cheaper train fares in advance and when things are moved it causes problems			0
’ @entity169 ( pictured here is pundit @entity171 ) have been criticised for their fixture scheduling with @entity1 @entity169 have two evening games in december but they are during the midweek when night fixtures were scheduled to take place in any case			2
@entity28 ’s trip to @entity179 on december 2 is impossible to get back from the same night using public transport but @entity44 ’s visit to @entity182 has frequent trains running up until midnight without changes , available at reasonable cost			1
a spokesman for @entity169 said : ‘ fixture scheduling is a complex process involving multiple parties - clubs , broadcasters , police and local authorities - and all sign off match selections			0
we always strive to balance local and fan needs alongside the need to schedule games for the benefit of our viewers			0
