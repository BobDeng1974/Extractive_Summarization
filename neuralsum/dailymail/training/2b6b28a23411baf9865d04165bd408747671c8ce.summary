when @entity1 , 18 , from @entity2 was offered a tattoo for her 16th birthday present , she jumped at the chance			1
but the teen was left humiliated after the bungling tattooist produced a portrait of @entity9 that looked more like a blow up doll			1
now miss @entity1 , a hairdresser , has finally managed to have the offending inking covered up and said she is ' chuffed ' with the results			1
although she underwent laser treatment earlier this year following an appearance on @entity29 show @entity30 , the results were n't quite what she wanted and instead , she decided to have a new tattoo			2
' i ’m really chuffed with the new tattoo , it looks great , ' said a delighted @entity36 , who had her new inking at the @entity39 tattoo parlour in @entity40			2
' i made a big mistake by getting the first one done and i ’ve definitely learned my lesson			0
i went for a couple of sessions of laser treatment but it did n’t fully take it away			0
' i always knew i was going to get one done as soon as i turned 18 anyway so i just had to be patient and wait			0
' inspiration : she had hoped for something resembling the actress ( left ) but got ' a blow - up doll ' instead painful : she began laser treatment after an appearance on @entity30 but it failed to work miss @entity1 was left devastated after being given a botched tattoo by ' conman ' @entity15 and later reported him to the police			1
speaking about the original inking , she said : ' i looked on the internet for pictures of @entity9			2
' then i found the tattooist on a social media website , i had a look through his work and they all seemed really nice			0
but i later found out they were someone else ’s work			0
' i could see that it looked awful , as he was doing it , but i was too scared to say anything			0
it definitely was n’t a success , it looks horrible			0
' miss @entity1 booked the session with @entity15 , of @entity79 , after being impressed with designs on his @entity81 on @entity82			1
he was fined £ 300 for operating a tattoo business without a licence when he appeared at @entity85 last year			2
fined : ' @entity86 ' @entity15 was given a £ 300 fine for operating a tattoo parlour without a license			1

@entity1 , 18 , was devastated when her dream tattoo was botched
instead of @entity9 , she got something that resembled ' a blow up doll '
has now had the offending inking covered up with a *prettier* design
had tried to have it lasered off but tattoo proved *impossible* to shift
bungling tattooist @entity15 was fined for operating without a licence
