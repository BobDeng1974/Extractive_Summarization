@entity1 has risen from 2.1 violent scenes per hour in 2001/2 to 11.5 scenes per hour last year			1

the @entity10 show also accounted for all of what were classed as ‘ strong violence ’ , much of them coming from two storylines			1
almost three - quarters of the scenes classed as violent were made up of threats and intimidation or incidents such as pushing , prodding and tripping			2
fists were used in only five per cents of the incidents - slightly fewer than the slaps which made up six per cent - and the shooting of firearms made up less than one per cent			0

‘ in @entity1 all the violent scenes with a high severity rating were either central or pivotal to the storyline in which they appeared			1
@entity80 occurred for a reason , and was used to drive the narrative along			0
‘ in the overwhelming number of cases it was considered to add dramatic value to the plot or the characterisations			0
’ the report pointed out that violence in the soaps - which it said in most cases was ‘ quite mild ’ - did not trivialise , glamorise or condone it			0
and it said that for the most part viewers would have been aware they could expect the violent scenes and would not have been surprised by it			1
last year @entity8 ruled that @entity1 breached its programme code by screening a scene before the watershed in which character @entity101 was pushed under a train			1
however there have not been any major viewer complaints about violence in the series since then			0

‘ the portrayal of violence is appropriately limited and is shown within the context of long - running storylines - and programmes that include scenes which some people may find upsetting are clearly flagged to viewers at the beginning of the broadcast			0
‘ @entity1 has a track record in tackling issues affecting its audience and has worked alongside government and leading charities on subjects such as domestic abuse and bullying			2

the drama focused on a ‘ whodunnit - style ’ killing which later revealed @entity168 to be his killer			0
however , some of the biggest drama of the show came last year when - to celebrate the soap turning 18 years old - five main characters were killed off in one week			2
@entity175 and @entity176 were killed in an explosion , while @entity178 was ran over by @entity179 after @entity180 pushed her in front of his car			0
@entity183 and newcomer @entity184 were also killed off in @entity1 later			2
last year , the @entity10 show was wrapped by @entity8 for breaching broadcasting rules in an episode , screened at 6.30pm , in which a main character was killed by a speeding train			1
the scene , aired in march , marked the culmination of a long - running revenge storyline involving a former undercover policeman , @entity101 , and ex-drug dealer @entity194			0

@entity10 said that the storyline had run for around a year and that viewers were notified that a dramatic episode would be broadcast			2
@entity226 - played by @entity227 - was killed off in @entity22 earlier this year however , @entity8 said the pre-programme information was too vague and would ' not have prepared the significant number of younger viewers in the audience , or their parents , adequately for the violent , intense and shocking scenes which followed			1
' other dramatic storylines in popular @entity4 soaps so far this year include the death of @entity226 – played by @entity227 – in @entity22			0
