by @entity0 published : 18:02 est , 24 november 2013 updated : 05:31 est , 25 november 2013 @entity1 from @entity2 , @entity3 , who had £ 150,000 paid into his bank account from @entity5 with profits of half - a - million pounds a day thanks to record prices , it 's perhaps no surprise that an energy giant would fail to notice a mere £ 150,000 going astray			1
but when the six - figure sum from @entity5 popped up unexpectedly in amateur actor @entity1 's bank account , it was a moment of eye - rubbing disbelief - not least as he is n't even one of their customers			1
despite living in a shared house and working in a call centre as he pursues his dream of a professional drama career , the 30 - year - old resisted temptation and informed his bank there must have been a mistake			1
however , as of last night , the small fortune - just about enough to cover the chief executive 's annual bonus - was last night still sitting in his account waiting to be recalled by the @entity31 - owned multinational			1
yesterday mr @entity1 said the astonishing oversight showed the @entity34 energy giants were making so much money that the small matter of a missing £ 150,000 was barely worth chasing			1
' they probably spend that sort of money on a corporate night out , yet it could heat thousands of pensioners ' homes this winter , ' he said			1
' people are having to go hungry because their energy bills are so high , and yet @entity5 can transfer a vast sum of money by a casual mistake and not even notice			2
' what 's particularly scary is that i have n't been one of their customers for five years , so how have they even got my details ? ' mr @entity1 checked his online @entity52 account on tuesday expecting it have less than £ 70 remaining			1
instead , he was stunned to see his balance swollen by a payment of £ 151,786.69 from @entity5			0
' i could n't believe my eyes , ' said			2
' at first i thought : " have i won the @entity59 ? " ' i phoned my bank and they said : " do n't spend it yet "			2
i told them not to worry , i had no intention of spending it			0
' @entity5 make millions of pounds a day , they could quite easily afford to take me to court and accuse me of theft if they wanted to			0
the six - figure sum from @entity5 popped up unexpectedly in amateur actor @entity1 's bank account - not least as he is n't even one of their customers ' but i have to count every penny to pay my bills , so to have that sort of life - changing amount sitting taunting me in my account is pretty hard to deal with			1
' mr @entity1 earns less than £ 20,000 - a - year in a call centre and lives in a shared house in @entity2 , @entity3 with two friends , paying £ 525 - a - month in rent			1
his passion is acting - he recently played @entity82 in @entity84 's production of @entity86 's @entity85 - and it 's money that could have helped him fulfil his dream			1
' i 'd love to go to drama school , which these days would cost around £ 60,000 , ' he said			0
' in a parallel universe where i do just go and spend the money , i could pay for that and get my own flat as well			0
' he has n't been a customer with @entity5 since he was a student in 2008			0
his current home has a pre-pay meter which mr @entity1 said was swallowing up more and more of the friends ' income			2
' we have to be careful to make sure we can pay the bills , ' he said			0
his bank has told him that @entity5 will have to request the money transfer is rescinded before it can be taken out of his account			1
for now , he has transferred it into his savings account to avoid confusion - and he may be able to pocket any interest it earns			2
@entity5 last month put fuel prices up by 10.4 per cent , more than rivals @entity109 and @entity110 , taking an average annual bill for gas and electricity to £ 1,459			0
it recently revealed profits so far this year of £ 116million , however that was down on last year and led to warnings of 2,000 job losses			0
but chief executive @entity118 branded calls for him to give up his annual bonus of around £ 150,000 a ' gimmick ' , saying he would only receive it for meeting customer satisfaction targets			0
anyone who receives a windfall which they suspect was deposited accidentally and fails to inform their bank is likely to be committing the offence of retaining wrongful credit under the 1968 @entity131			0
in 2008 @entity132 , of @entity133 , was jailed for ten months after spending £ 135,000 wrongly paid into her sister 's @entity135 account on a holiday to @entity138 , luxury furniture and gifts to relations			2
an @entity5 spokesman said : ' we 're currently investigating this internally as a matter of urgency			0

money *appeared* in amateur actor @entity1 's bank account
the 30 - year - old has n't been one of their customers for five years
the money was still in his account as of last night , waiting for *retrieval*
