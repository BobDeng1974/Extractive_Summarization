controversial wellness blogger @entity0 is still being investigated over claims she faked her cancer battles , despite reports police had dropped the investigation			1
@entity6 had explored the option of criminal charges being levelled against ms @entity0 after people began to question her cancer claims and charity work last month			1
' i know other things have been said this morning , but our approach is the same as it was yesterday and the day before that , ' a @entity6 spokeswoman said			2
consumer affairs @entity28 said the investigation is continuing			1
' as far as we 're aware , nothing has changed , ' a spokeswoman told @entity24			2
the decision comes after ms @entity0 has expressed concern over her family 's safety in her first comments to media since she admitted her terminal cancer may have been ' misdiagnosed '			1
doting young mum : ms @entity0 has expressed concern about her family 's safety after her son 's childcare details were allegedly placed online in an interview with @entity24 , ms @entity0 claimed her son 's childcare details , her home address and floor plan had been posted online amidst the fierce backlash against her			1
she said that was the reason ' police came to our home checking in on my safety ' last week			0
ms @entity0 also hit out at some of her critics , saying that while she understood ' everyone 's anger and confusion ' , some people had responded ' maliciously '			1
ms @entity0 's remarks came during a devastating 24 hours for her business , with local publisher @entity70 and a @entity72 publishing house dumping ms @entity0 's @entity20 recipe book			1
the @entity20 , a popular app , gained media attention because of ms @entity0 's remarkable story about cancer survival ' our address being posted online to a website ... is not ok , ' she said , providing @entity24 with screenshots of her address posted on @entity83			1
the @entity85 star did not address questions concerning her cancer diagnosis , saying she would ' have a statement live this week ' where she would address medical questions			1
' our address being posted online to a website ... is not ok , ' she said , providing @entity24 with screenshots of her address posted on @entity83			1
' i do think it 's important for myself and the company to recognise everyone 's anger and confusion surrounding this last week , though this does n't justify how others have perpetuated this or responded so maliciously			0
' she has not provided evidence of her childcare or floor plan claims at time of publication			2
her remarks came during a devastating 24 hours for her business , with local publisher @entity70 and a @entity72 publishing house dumping ms @entity0 's @entity20 recipe book			1
the book had been written in conjunction with her hugely successful app of the same name , which is set to feature on the @entity112			0
the app gained popularity after ms @entity0 claimed she warded off a terminal brain cancer diagnosis through diet and a holistic approach to life			1
but after close friends last week cast doubt on these claims , ms @entity0 herself admitted in an interview with the @entity125 that an announcement last year that her cancer had spread to her liver , spleen , blood and uterus was a ' misdiagnosis '			1
ms @entity0 explained why she today wiped all her remaining photos from her @entity85 account - some had already been removed - and had the @entity136 deleted			1
' at the end of the day , i am a human being on the receiving end of comments , questions and emails and even if the public are used to a digital interaction with me , it does not warrant some of the recent responses , ' she said			0
the @entity20 was voted @entity112 's @entity148 and @entity149 of 2013 and will feature on the @entity112			2
the technology giant did not respond to @entity24 's requests for comment on tuesday she said the social media accounts were ' further encouraging interactions between those who were angry and encouraging personal data , information or other security - sensitive content to be shared or made light of			2
' my son 's childcare details were posted online in the midst of this , so i 'm sure you can understand how unnecessary , concerning and threatening that is			1
' ms @entity0 said the statement she was writing was taking ' longer than anticipated ' because of media requests and ' constantly arising issues ' , ' with the paramount focus being protecting the safety of myself and my son '			1
@entity6 told @entity24 they visited an @entity176 home last tuesday evening ' as part of a welfare check			2
they left shortly after with nil concerns			0
' some of ms @entity0 's former followers have taken to social media to try to ' expose ' her - posting images of her drinking alcohol before she became a clean - living star and old claims about her battle with cancer			1
the @entity0 uncovered @entity83 page has been sharing images of her sipping beer clean - living @entity0 , seen here with a pint in her hand , told the friends who have spoken out about her to ' make yourself invisible to me , and my life ' the administrators of the @entity199 uncovered @entity83 page , which has been sharing images of her sipping beer and champagne and eating vegan doughnuts , said they are doing so because ms @entity0 ' fiercely censors the @entity136 '			1
' the reason is simple , to educate and inform the many people who have already commented on this page feeling betrayed , deceived and let down by someone who they trusted , ' they wrote			0
' many people followed this person , they believed in her and some even abandoned conventional medicine in favour of embracing her lifestyle in desperate hope they could cure their illnesses			0
on monday afternoon , @entity125 publisher @entity70 said it had been left with ' no other option ' but to stop supplying her book in @entity125			0

' we remain hopeful that we will receive the formal assurances we have requested in the coming days			0
