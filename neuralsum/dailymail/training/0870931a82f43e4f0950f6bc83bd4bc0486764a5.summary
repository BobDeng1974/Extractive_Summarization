by @entity0 @entity1 : 03:46 est , 31 december 2013 @entity2 : 03:49 est , 31 december 2013 strong : admirers and opponents both value that she would never have dreamed of moving her position to fit the consensus you will always remember this moment , ' my mother told me , as i watched the lady dressed in blue walking through @entity16 's shiny black door			2
thirty - five years later , it is still the childhood memory that is most indelibly seared into my brain : my mother calling me to the television set to see @entity21 reciting the @entity23 prayer and then entering no 10			2
my mother was a shop - owner raised in a council house in @entity25 ; she was as convinced of @entity27 's greatness on the first day of her momentous time in office as millions were when she left it			1
and when the former prime minister died this year , it was the strivers like my mother — the people who came from nothing , who worked hard and pulled themselves up by their bootstraps — who most mourned her passing			1
to those people , @entity21 personified all that is best about our nation , and about our politics			1
her legacy stands today as a shining example , not only to citizens who aspire through their own endeavours to lead more prosperous and productive lives , but also to politicians who aspire to represent those people			1
@entity21 , who died in april aged 87 , was the last great conviction politician this country has known			1
she was also the last to imbue hard - working @entity55 with a sense that the government was on their side			1
she unleashed a spirit of enterprise that turned @entity55 from a laughing stock into a global force that tackled and helped to defeat @entity64 communism			1
she led from the front and from a deep sense of her own instinctive belief in the right of the individual to determine their own destiny			1
she loathed above all things the u-turn , a manoeuvre that seems to have been perfected in recent years by @entity75 and his @entity78 - savvy @entity77 chums			2
her leadership was the polar opposite of government by focus group , a tendency begun by @entity84			2
instead of bowing to political weather , she changed it			1
she understood that there was no honour in formulating policies simply because they were popular			2
she would never have dreamed of moving her own position to fit the consensus			2
that is why the one thing you hear said about @entity21 by admirers and opponents alike is : ' you might not have agreed with her , but you knew where you stood			1
' changed history : @entity21 's funeral in april marked the passing of our last conviction politician how different to the leadership that came after her			1
it speaks volumes that anyone who has ever tried to outline @entity75 's philosophy has become mired in a terrible muddle			2
by contrast , what @entity21 believed is as easy for a brickie or a bookie to explain as it is for a professor of politics			2
she stood for individual freedom and free enterprise			1
and yes , she clobbered those who got in the way of that			2
she knew that no state - owned industry , government regulation or union demand for wage increases was a substitute for the virtuous cycle that begins when one individual starts a business of their own and begins employing people			1
her rigorous sense of fairness was sometimes brutal			2
charging local tax according to the number of people in a house , and the amount of services used , was correct in theory but , in practice , triggered such powerful emotions that it led to the political disaster of the poll tax riots			1
but you only need to look at the individual stories of those who flourished during the @entity21 era to see how ' thatcherism ' worked			1
she unleashed a spirit of enterprise that turned @entity55 from a laughing stock into a global force on the day we watched her walk through the door of @entity161 , my mother had been full of hope not just because the new prime minister was the first woman ever to hold the post , but because @entity21 was a shopkeeper 's daughter who spoke the language of common sense			1
and @entity55 was in desperate need of common sense			1
my mother was fond of telling me then , as she does now , horror stories about the winter of discontent in 1978/9 , before @entity21 came to power : how clients with wet hair sat under the driers of her hairdressing shop in darkness for hours , waiting for the power to come back on			2
many of the young today who happily join in on @entity180 and @entity181 with the @entity183 's relentless haranguing of @entity21 have no idea of what it was like to experience rubbish piled up in the streets , or bodies left unburied , or power cuts and — under @entity192 's earlier lacklustre leadership — the three - day week			1
whenever @entity193 talk about putting up income tax , the misty - eyed idealists who vote for them , and who denounce @entity21 as cruel , conveniently forget that millionaires routinely used to move abroad to avoid paying tax altogether in this country			2
and when socialist bigots sought to tarnish @entity21 's memory by hurling vile insults at her when she died , they only served to highlight what she was up against , and fought so hard to overcome , when she was in power			1
' @entity209 dong the witch is dead ' , a moronic police sergeant from @entity208 wrote on @entity181			0
well , yes , in a way , mrs @entity21 was a sort of witch			0
she was certainly a miracle worker for dragging @entity55 back from the brink of irrelevance			1
and there was something almost supernatural about her ability to tackle vested interests , seemingly without fear			0
@entity84 , in contrast , watered down his education and health reforms to appease the teaching and health sector unions defending their cosy pay deals			0
but @entity21 would not be intimidated or worn down			0
she saw her mission through to prise @entity55 industry from the vice-like grip of the unions			1
she cut taxes , enabled people to own their own homes for the first time , and sparked a revolution , social and economic , which attracted an influx of talent and money into this country			1
she gave @entity55 a purpose again			1
very few people shape a nation 's history			1
very few leaders are exactly what a nation needs at precisely the time it needs it			0
i do n't think it is overstating things to compare @entity21 to @entity253 , who saw off the invading @entity254 and transformed @entity55 into a world power			1
iconic : very few leaders are exactly what a nation needs at precisely the time it needs it			0
@entity21 was @entity21 was an icon every bit as potent on her stage as the virgin queen — and with that halo of hair she almost took on the look of @entity253			0
just as @entity253 was said to be married to @entity268 , @entity21 put the duty she believed she owed her country before the responsibility she felt to her family			0
she may not have been the greatest mother , but to women ( such as me ) who like their female role models to be gritty , tough and uncompromising , @entity21 was a heroine			0
she had that rarest of qualities , not caring about what people thought of her			1
she was an exciting figure , a disrupter , an agitator			0
she never played safe , unlike so many of our political elite nowadays			0
one could fantasise endlessly about what @entity21 would have done about our problems today			0
faced with extremist islamists threatening her own people , what would she tell the @entity290 when they ruled she could not deport them ? she would slam her handbag down and , with fire in her eyes , declare : ' no , no , no ! ' and they would struggle to argue with her			1
she was , after all , a force of nature			0
her stoicism and relentless determination to propel her government forwards at all times led detractors to portray her as heartless or even inhuman			0
but this misses the point			0
she had a heart , and she had feelings			0
she just was n't afraid to push them into the background so she could get on with the job			1
she stood for individual freedom and free enterprise			1
anyone who got in the way was clobbered if she had a blind spot , it was to disregard the fact that other people were not made of the same stuff she was			2
there is a poignant scene in the film @entity321 where she snatches a paper from her senior @entity324 colleague @entity323 and starts correcting his spelling			0
her insensitivity and lack of tolerance sowed the seeds of her eventual destruction			0
but whatever her faults , they pale into insignificance compared to the self - seeking sleaze of the political class that came after her			0
unlike so many of today 's politicians , she was frugal and uninterested in the frippery of power			0
she would not have dreamed of overseeing a high - spec make - over of the kitchen in the @entity16 apartment , as the @entity342 did			0
not that she was uninterested in domestic matters			0
@entity344 was a unique brand of feminism			0
she would grab a vacuum cleaner during photocalls when it suited her , to become a housewife again			0
she connected with people by explaining the economy in terms of their household finances			2
my favourite phrase of hers was : ' if you want something said , ask a man ; if you want something done , ask a woman			0
' as @entity364 observes in his biography : ' @entity363 was never a philosophy , but a disposition of mind and character embodied in a highly unusual woman			0
' there was one particular occasion i remember meeting her			0
it was during then @entity377 leader @entity376 's doomed 2001 general election campaign when she joined in for a day and set the campaign briefly alight			2
she opened a speech that evening by noting that a cinema nearby was advertising the film called @entity383			0
with a withering stare , she said : ' you were expecting me after all ! ' she knew there were many people , even those who did n't like her , who deep down wanted her back , in the way a child left to run wild longs for a strong parent			1
cast your eyes around for a political a leader of her stature today — and you will find , sadly , no one even comes close .			0

she stood for individual freedom and free enterprise , and would n't budge
