like many twins , they are dressed alike , right down to their pink and white bootees			2
but @entity3 and @entity4 are no ordinary twins			1
they are one in a million			0
an amazing quirk of genetics means that one sister has black skin and the other is white			1
father @entity15 and mother @entity16 cradle twins @entity3 ( centre left ) and @entity4 ( centre right ) who were born with very different skin tones thanks to a rare quirk of genetics miss @entity16 , 28 , is white , while mr @entity15 , 24 , is half @entity21			1
their twins ' skin contrast is possible because the girls are non-identical , though it is still highly unlikely the effect is so striking that even their own father has said it is hard to believe that they are related			1
and their mother , @entity16 , said : ‘ when they were born , we kept staring at both of them – we could n’t believe it			1
‘ it was a lovely feeling and a big shock			0
‘ one thing i know for sure is that family and friends wo n’t ever struggle to tell them apart			0
’ the little girls ’ contrasting looks can be traced back to their parents			1
their father , @entity15 , is half - @entity21 , while their mother is white			2
as non-identical twins , they were created when two eggs were fertilised by two sperm			2
this means they have inherited different genes from their parents			2
normally , you would expect both to inherit a mix of black and white genes and be born with a similar skin tone			0
mr @entity15 says that the couple do get looks when they are out in public with the girls , and admits that if he saw somebody with them , he would struggle to believe they were related the girls also have very different personalities , as well as different skin tones			1
@entity67 ( left ) is very relaxed and likes to sleep a lot , but @entity4 ( right ) cries a lot and demands lots of attention but , in odds of a million to one , @entity4 has inherited a set of genes for white skin			1
and @entity3 ’s genetic inheritance includes some genes that code for black skin , passed on from her mixed - race father			1
the twins also have very different characters			0
@entity3 , who weighed 6lb 1oz when she was born three months ago , is very laid - back and likes nothing more than to sleep the day away			2
the pair say that since having twins they have forgotten what it feels like to have a good night 's sleep , but say they would n't have it any other way in contrast , @entity4 , who was slightly heavier at 6lb 5oz , is ‘ loud and needy ’ and loves attention			1
this could come in useful , as she and her sister are already attracting attention wherever they go			0
their mother , a 28 - year - old delivery driver for @entity102 , said : ‘ when people look in the pram and see that one is darker than the other , they will sometimes be a bit thrown and ask if they are twins			2
‘ they are shocked when we say yes			0
’ mr @entity15 , a 24 - year - old builder from @entity112 in the @entity113 , told the @entity114 : ‘ everybody loves them			1
‘ we ’ve got used to it but you hear people whisper as we walk past			0
‘ if i saw them out , i do n’t think i ’d believe they were related			0
’ the couple , who also have a five - year - old son called @entity125 , knew from quite early on in the pregnancy that @entity16 was having twins			1
however , they were n’t prepared for how much work would be involved			0
but while they have completely forgotten what it is like to have a good night ’s sleep , they would n’t have it any other way			0
@entity137 , a @entity138 fertility doctor , said that just as twins can have different hair or eyes , they can also be born with skin of different colours			2
and just as a baby ’s hair often changes with age , with blonde hair , for instance , darkening , the twins ’ skin may yet change			2
this could lead to them looking more similar – or even more different			0
professor @entity137 said the girls ’ contrasting skin colours are caused by the way their parents ’ genes were shuffled before being passed on			1
he said : ‘ this shuffling has created something that is completely unexpected and throws us but it is just nature ’s way of making us diverse			0
’ @entity166 can be created in two different ways			0
either by one sperm fertilizing one egg , which then splits into two foetuses , or by two different sperm fertilizing two different eggs			0
the first method leads to monozygotic , or identical twins , who share the same set of dna , and so will be the same sex and largely share the same physical characteristics			1
the second method will create dizygotic , or non-identical twins , who do not share the same genetic material and can therefore be born as different genders and with different physical characteristics			1
@entity3 and @entity4 are dizygotic twins , which explains their contrasting skin tone , though having twins with such a drastic difference in colour is still extremely rare			1
the fact that they share a gender is completely down to chance .			0

@entity16 , 28 , and @entity15 , 24 , had twins @entity3 and @entity4
girls are non-identical , meaning they do not share the same set of dna
this means their physical characteristics and genders can vary
however , having such contrasting skin tones is still extremely rare
