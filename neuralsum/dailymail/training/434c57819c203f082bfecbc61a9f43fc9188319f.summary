by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 are close to tying up a £ 6million deal for @entity4 after the @entity6 goalkeeper flew into the country on monday			0
@entity8 , 32 , is expected to undergo a medical before completing his move to the @entity12 champions			0
the @entity13 , who worked with @entity2 boss @entity15 at @entity6 , will come in as no 2 to @entity17 goalkeeper @entity16 following @entity19 ’s move to @entity20 on a free transfer			1

he becomes @entity2 ’s third signing of the summer following the arrivals of midfielder @entity43 from @entity44 and @entity45 right - back @entity46			0
the club ’s priority remains a central defender , however , and it seems increasingly like that @entity15 will move for @entity51 ’s @entity50 if his first - choice , @entity53 of @entity44 , continues to stall over a move			2
