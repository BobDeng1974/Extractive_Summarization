by @entity0 published : 07:15 est , 26 september 2012 updated : 11:11 est , 26 september 2012 the world ’s largest solar chandelier was unveiled at a @entity4 science park today powered by 700 glass bulbs which light up when exposed to sunlight			1
each bulb contains an individual @entity8 , tiny metal paddles which spin when hit by sunlight , causing the 15ft - high light to shimmer and flicker			1
it is the centrepiece of the newly - opened @entity12 in @entity14 ’s @entity13 , @entity15 , a world - class centre for science and technology businesses			2
flittering in the light : the world 's largest solar chandelier has tiny ' paddles ' that react to sunlight - causing it to flicker gently glow in the dark : while the chandelier is lit via electricity in the evening , sunlight from the chandelier is used kinetically during the day , causing a shimmering appearance the chandelier is made from 700 glass @entity30 radiometers , individual glass bulbs containing metal paddles that spin when powered by sunlight artist @entity34 , who created the giant structure , is renowned for his extravagant installations - his ongoing ‘ @entity37 ’ exhibition has seen more than 700 grand pianos placed in cities across the world			1
he said : ' scientists and artists often start by asking similar questions about the natural world but end up with completely different answers			0
' both have to take a leap from what can be observed into what is unknown			0
it ’s important to explore these boundaries and limitations			0
' for many years after the invention of the radiometer , a fierce debate raged about how they worked and it was many years before it was fully explained			0
' they are still beautiful , inspiring and thought provoking			0
' in a way , the chandelier could n’t really be anywhere else but @entity15 & @entity12 , a place built to solve scientific riddles and to lead to innovation			2
' @entity30 radiometers were invented by @entity4 scientist @entity30 , whose experiments with cathode ray tubes led to innovations which were used in the earliest televisions			0
they are sealed to contain a partial vacuum , with lightweight metal veins spaced on an axle in the centre			2
one side of the paddle is white , the other is black , and as sunlight - or radiation - hit the vane , the paddles spin			1
this puzzled the scientific community for decades			0
but finally it was discovered that the photons of light would heat up the black side of the paddles , and the unequal distribution of heat would warm the paddle 's internal air molecules , causing the gentle motion			2
but the paddles rely on a partial vacuum composed just right - with enough air molecules inside to produce air currents			1
artist @entity34 , who created the giant structure , is also responsible for the ' play me , i 'm @entity102 ' public piano installations			1

artist @entity34 uses tiny vacuum - sealed paddles which *rotate* when sunlight hits them - causing chandelier to shimmer as the rays hit
