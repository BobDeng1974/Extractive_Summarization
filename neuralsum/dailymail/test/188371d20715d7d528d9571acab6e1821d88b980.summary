the @entity4 international has been abused , even by his own fans , over his decision to put deal talks on hold after rejecting an offer worth £ 90,000 - per - week			1
@entity0 was even heckled at the club 's recent kit launch , but the 20 - year - old , speaking for the first time since his now infamous @entity15 interview , insists he is immune to the negative comments			1
@entity0 says he pays no attention to criticism levelled at him for contract stand - off with @entity3 @entity0 ( left ) tussles for possession with @entity3 team - mate @entity23 during training on thursday in an interview with @entity26 , @entity0 said : ' everyone has their opinion on me at this moment in time but i ’m just a kid who loves to play football and to try and improve every day and be the best i can be			1
' it just goes in one ear and goes out the other			0
i do n’t read anything , do n’t look at anything and , for me , it ’s all football			2
i ’m genuinely focused on doing my best for this football club			1
' @entity0 is one of @entity42 's most sought after young players			1
@entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 all have a genuine interest			0
@entity50 supremo @entity49 admitted the @entity52 giants were keeping tabs on the youngster , while @entity55 and @entity56 are monitoring his contract situation			2

i ’m still learning and developing so only time will tell			0
