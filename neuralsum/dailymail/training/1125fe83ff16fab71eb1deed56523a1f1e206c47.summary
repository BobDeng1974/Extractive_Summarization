by @entity0 published : 17:01 est , 7 march 2014 updated : 17:01 est , 7 march 2014 @entity2 bemoaned the @entity4 demise of his absent friend as he called the @entity7 ’s decision to sack @entity8 ‘ disrespectful			1
’ @entity10 ’ great entertainer returns from injury for the first of three @entity14 internationals on sunday at the @entity15 in @entity16 disappointed that the player of the tournament when @entity4 won the short - form @entity19 four years ago will not be back in @entity21 now			1
‘ i ’m disappointed by the manner he had to bow out of international cricket , ’ said @entity2 , a close friend of @entity8 and a key figure in @entity10 own @entity14 triumph in @entity24 two years ago			1
‘ it ’s disrespectful , the way he had to go			0
he ’ll definitely be missed by spectators , so i will try to put on a display			0
it 's in his hands now : @entity2 says he 'll have to ' put on a show ' in @entity8 's absence lack of respect : @entity2 disagrees with @entity4 's decision to axe his friend @entity8 ( right ) old pals ' act : @entity2 and @entity8 show their mutual admiration for each other in 2009 ‘ i do n’t know what happened behind closed doors but for such a big player who has made such an impact around the world to go out like that was sad			1
' you want to give a great player the chance to retire and walk away from the game regardless of what has happened			0
' we have swapped a few texts since the decision was made and he will be ok , i 'm sure			0
he has a lot of business to do			0
i actually think he will be playing on sunday ! he will be replacing @entity63 ! ’ that will not happen , with @entity4 ’s resolve as strong as ever to move on without @entity8 , believing their decision to sack him a ‘ no brainer ’ after constant bad behaviour in @entity70 while being on a final warning			1
indeed , they have several pages of cumulated evidence on why he had to go			0
@entity2 force : the @entity10 opener has returned after missing the @entity79 series , which @entity4 won short - term pain , long - term gain : @entity4 will miss @entity8 in the @entity14 this month but they maintain the decision to sack him was the right one winner : player of the tournament @entity8 celebrates wildly with the @entity86 in 2010 there is no question that @entity4 ’s hopes both in this three - match series and in the @entity14 that follows in @entity91 will be lesser without @entity8 but they believe the short - term pain will be worth the long - term gain			1
one @entity4 player who is very much here and delighted to be so is home - town boy @entity95 , who will be watched by a large number of family and friends on his return to his native @entity16 with his adopted country			1
@entity95 has long since thrown in his lot with @entity4 having been spotted here by former @entity4 batsman @entity102 and offered a scholarship at @entity104 and he insists there will be no conflicting emotions if , as expected , he returns to the @entity4 team on sunday having missed the last two games			2
‘ it ’s a very nice feeling to be back , ’ said @entity95 , who is trying to claim the whole of @entity4 ’s allocation of tickets for sunday 's match			2
‘ i will be very proud to wear an @entity4 shirt in @entity16			2
‘ i do n’t know how the home spectators will react to me but my family and friends are behind me a hundred per cent and that ’s what matters to me			2
i ’m more than happy with my decision			0
’ home boy : @entity95 is back on @entity16 , the @entity123 island on which he was born and raised just the ticket : @entity95 joked that he was trying to claim the full allocation for sunday 's match in an ideal world @entity95 should be playing for @entity10 but , to be fair to him , he has said that he wanted to play for @entity4 from the moment he started making an impact at @entity129 as a teenager and served a qualification period , even playing for @entity16 in @entity133 winters as an overseas player			1
he insists no serious approach has ever been made to him to play for @entity10			0
serious back injuries and a loss of form prompted a move to @entity140 where he finally fulfilled his huge potential and he has made a good impression in the handful of one - day appearances he has so far made against @entity70 and now @entity10			0
he will play on sunday if @entity4 leave out one of the spinners who served them so well in @entity148 on what is expected to be a much better @entity16 pitch than the one seen at the sir @entity151 for a one - day series that @entity4 won 2 - 1			1
winners : the @entity4 side celebrate their one - day international series victory in @entity148			0

@entity2 ' disappointed ' in way @entity8 's @entity4 *career* ended
@entity2 says @entity8 ' will definitely be missed by spectators '
@entity10 opener *cheekily* says he thinks @entity8 will replace @entity63
@entity16 - born @entity95 will play for @entity4 on his home island
@entity95 's family and friends will take over the @entity15
