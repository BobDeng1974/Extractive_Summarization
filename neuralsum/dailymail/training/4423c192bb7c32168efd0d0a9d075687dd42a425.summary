by @entity0 published : 19:09 est , 20 march 2013 updated : 02:36 est , 21 march 2013 @entity1 yesterday won his battle to let hard - working families earn up to £ 10,000 a year tax - free			1
his cherished policy to benefit low earners will now be introduced in april 2014 , a year earlier than expected			0
but the speeded - up timetable means a record five million workers are set to pay higher rate tax by the end of next year , experts warned last night			1
cherished policy : deputy prime minister @entity1 in @entity13 ahead of the budget during which he won his battle to let hard - working families earn up to £ 10,000 a year tax - free the numbers dragged into paying 40p income tax is expected to rise from 4.1million today to 4.9million in 2014			1
the hike in personal allowance thresholds from £ 6,475 to £ 10,000 means 2.7million people have been lifted out of paying any income tax at all since 2010			1
for the average taxpayer , it will amount to paying £ 705 less income tax compared to when the @entity27 took power			1
changes announced in the @entity14 yesterday mean that for most people the point at which they start to pay higher rate tax will be £ 41,865			1
it means one in six workers will pay 40 per cent of every extra pound they earn to the @entity37 – a huge blow to the household finances of nearly another million families who wo n't consider themselves remotely well - off			1
@entity43 , of accountancy firm @entity44 , said : ' you no longer have to be wealthy to be a higher - rate tax payer			2
@entity48 , with his ministerial team , poses for pictures outside 11 @entity13 in @entity50 before announcing the @entity14 in @entity51 ' there will be many families who do n't see themselves as wealthy who will find themselves as unwilling higher - rate taxpayers			2
' increasing numbers of workers face paying higher tax rates because of what is known as ' fiscal drag '			2
currently , everyone can earn £ 8,105 tax - free – then pays income tax of 20 per cent on the next £ 34,370			1
once they have a £ 42,475 salary , they then pay 40 per cent income tax for every additional pound earned			1
from april , the personal allowance will rise to £ 9,440 – and then to £ 10,000 next year			0
normally , the 40 per cent higher - tax threshold rises in line with inflation to take into account rises in the cost of living			1
but from april 2014 , the point at which higher rate tax is paid is to rise by a flat 1 per cent for two years instead			1
this lower rise in the threshold means more workers will be caught in this 40 per cent net			2
in 1978 , only three per cent of taxpayers paid tax at the higher rate			1
in 1989 , the figure had barely moved to just five per cent			0
under @entity85 , the figure rose to 3.8 million before falling back to three million when the @entity27 was elected in 2010			2
however , under the current government , the figure has rocketed			0
' by the end of this parliament , more than two million extra workers will have been dragged into the higher band , ' mr @entity43 added			2
* @entity48 suffered an embarrassing setback last night as his controversial scheme to allow workers to trade in their employment rights in return for shares was thrown out by the @entity98			0
peers voted by 232 votes to 178 against the proposal , which would allow staff to give up key employment rights in return for shares in the company worth anything from £ 2,000 to £ 50,000			0
ten @entity109 rebels voted against the plans , including the former cabinet ministers @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115			0
former head of the @entity117 said the plans would be ' very harmful to growth '			0
' in the old days the price of slavery was 20 or 30 pieces of silver – is it now £ 2,000 ? ' he asked			0
the chancellor unveiled the ' shares for rights ' plan at the @entity109 conference last october			0
he said it would boost entrepreneurial companies and allow staff to share in their growth			0
but critics argued that basic rights such as redundancy pay and unfair dismissal provisions should be preserved for all .			0

one in six workers will pay 40 per cent of every extra pound they earn
