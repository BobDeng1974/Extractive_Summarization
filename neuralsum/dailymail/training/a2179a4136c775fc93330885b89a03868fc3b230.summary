by @entity1 reporter questions were being raised tonight after a football referee mistakenly showed a red card to the wrong black player during today 's @entity8 - @entity7 game			1
@entity8 defender @entity9 was sent off the pitch after @entity11 handled the ball on the goal - line during the @entity15 ' 6 - 0 defeat at @entity16			1
this caught the eyes of tv pundits who questioned if referee @entity20 was being racist and could not tell the difference between the two young black players			1
mistaken identity : @entity9 ( left ) is shown a red card despite @entity11 's handball admission : @entity11 even approached @entity20 to tell him it was he who handled the ball the reactions on @entity31 followed hard and fast , with several posting that @entity9 had been sent off for ' being black '			1
despite @entity11 telling referee @entity20 several times that it was he who touched the ball , the referee maintained @entity9 should leave , ordering a penalty for @entity7			1
during the half - time analysis on @entity40 , former @entity8 striker @entity38 says : ‘ what is he [ referee ] saying , that they both look the same ? ’ fellow pundit @entity44 replies : ‘ is he [ @entity20 ] being racist ? ’ the former @entity46 winger was scathing in his assessment : ‘ the collection of errors by the officials — i mean , it ’s a shambles			2
’ sports site @entity53 also questioned the referee 's decision , saying @entity9 and @entity11 were ' pretty different looking chaps with one obvious similarity a veteran referee should be able to see through '			1
@entity11 , who dived on the line to get a hand to @entity63 's effort from eight yards , admitted to referee @entity20 that it was himself who should have been penalised , saying : ' @entity67 , it was me ! ' the winger 's handball was intentional but unnecessary , with the ball going wide even without the touch			1
and despite @entity9 ' protestations , the left - back decided to depart the field before @entity7 went 3 - 0 up courtesy of @entity63 's penalty was converted			2
@entity8 may not appeal the decision to free up @entity11 for the visit of @entity80 on tuesday , but the @entity81 can appeal themselves to ensure the right person is punished			2
referee @entity20 reportedly admitted at half - time that it was his own mistake , not the linesman 's			2
this was @entity20 's first game at @entity16 since he awarded @entity7 a controversial late penalty for @entity91 's challenge on @entity92 in @entity94 's 2 - 2 draw with the @entity95 in november			0
it is a situation , however , that @entity97 , the chief of press for @entity99 , said would not have happened under @entity101 's policy to employ an extra referee on the by - line			0
not needed : the handball was intentional but not necessary , with the ball going wide the wrong man : @entity11 protests with the referee , telling him ' it was me ' why me ? @entity9 looks frustrated as he departs the pitch after being sent off aware : @entity11 looks guilty after handling the ball on the goal - line @entity97 wrote on @entity31 : ' what confusion at @entity8 with the pen decision			1
that 's why over 30 @entity117 countries have endorsed @entity101 - backed 5 officials system			0
' with an additional assistant referee on the end line , referee would not have got that sending off wrong			0
technology is not the answer ... ' @entity97 claimed that ' more eye balls ' were the key to improving referee decision - making rather than technology alone			0
the @entity129 has employed goal - line technology for the first time this season - which would not have aided @entity20 's decision at @entity7 because it determines whether a shot has crossed the line only			0
@entity97 added on @entity31 : ' more eye balls are the answer			0
@entity137 helps with goal line decisions , but five officials system gives referee more angles of vision			0
it 's not one vs the other			0
