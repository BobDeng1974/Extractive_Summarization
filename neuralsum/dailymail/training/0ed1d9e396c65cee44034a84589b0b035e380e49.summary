the @entity0 ratcheted up the online propaganda war on wednesday , tweeting a photo composite showing four dead @entity4 jihadis who it suggested were killed in overnight airstrikes in @entity7 – but later deleting it after @entity9 drew attention to the post			1
the ' @entity15 ' program 's @entity13 account blasted out the image to its nearly 8,000 followers			2
the initiative 's goal is to dissuade would - be jihadis , including so - called ' foreign fighters , ' from joining up with @entity4			1
the @entity23 government used the same account in recent weeks to distribute a mock @entity4 recruiting video that lambasted the terror group for mass executions and the destruction of @entity30 historical sites			1
@entity0 deputy spokeswoman @entity68 told reporters on sept. 5 that the anti-jihad campaign had already ' been appearing in @entity71 for quite some time			0
we are doing more in @entity73 as well			0
' the messages are produced by the agency 's @entity75 as a pushback against @entity56 terror groups that use online spaces to recruit militants and spread propaganda to young followers			0
efforts from @entity4 , in particular , have proven effective – and provide ample headaches to the agencies that comprise @entity23 's national security infrastructure			2
the terror army ' operates the most significant propaganda machine of any extremist group , ' according to @entity91 director center @entity90			0
one @entity4 - linked @entity13 account with nearly 10,000 followers claimed tuesday night that the ' first victims of air strikes by @entity23 on @entity7 ' were ' children and women			1
' another tweeted news stories from dubious sources claiming @entity101 fighter jets mistakenly bombed @entity103 allies , killing 75 fighters in a friendly - fire cockup			0
separately , a weeks - long @entity13 campaign centered around the hashtag # @entity108 spread a series of chest - puffing boasts , including direct threats against the @entity23 homeland			2
that hashtag has since been taken over by @entity23 who now regularly taunt @entity114			0
the @entity23 government aims to initiate a similar turnabout on a much larger scale so fewer @entity4 sympathizers will give in to the magnetic pull of a firefight in @entity121 or @entity7			1
about one - third of the 31,000 fighters available to @entity4 today came to @entity7 and @entity121 from other countries , including an estimated 2,000 from @entity124 and 100 from the @entity23			1
in a rare @entity126 meeting that featured 15 heads of state – not just ambassadors – a unanimous vote advanced a plan to fight terrorism with new legal penalties against ' foreign fighters ' @entity134 prime minister @entity133 , left , addressed the @entity126 summit on foreign terrorists after @entity23 president @entity61 used the monthly - rotating gavel to hold the vote @entity23 's messages are ' targeted at potential recruits [ and ] potential sympathizers , ' @entity68 said , ' to show and expose the brutality of terrorist organizations , including ... @entity4			1
' the larger goal is ' to point out the fallacies of what they ’re talking about , point out the inconsistencies , point out how this is contrary to @entity149 – and really make very clear what this group is so people do n’t join it			0
' the @entity23 and a group of nations , including some from the @entity65 world , began bombing @entity4 targets in @entity7 on monday			1
the @entity158 campaign 's ' recruiting ' video went viral three weeks ago ; it used the group 's own online propaganda footage to reposition murderous jihad as a foolish aspiration			2
its opening scene showed a mosque being blown up , followed by a photo of a decapitated body			0
viewers were told newly minted @entity4 soldiers can learn ‘ useful skills ’ including bombing mosques with @entity30 trapped inside , crucifying fellow @entity30 and plundering public resources			1
it closed with a sarcastic slogan : ‘ travel is inexpensive , because you wo n't need a return ticket ! ’ join today , a mocking @entity0 ' recruiting ' video said , and you too could destroy a mosque – as @entity4 soldiers have done in their sectarian @entity30 - on - @entity30 holy war lampoon : the @entity61 administration 's @entity75 even poked fun at @entity4 recruits for reportedly needing to bone up on their @entity149 basics before reporting for duty discouraging @entity23 ' foreign fighters ' too : when these two @entity193 - based @entity4 recruits turned up dead , the @entity0 hung their digital heads up for everyone in the @entity23 to see on wednesday in @entity198 , all 15 members of the @entity197 @entity126 approved a resolution that requires all 193 @entity197 countries to prosecute anyone who travels abroad to help @entity4			1
the same rule will apply to people who finance global terror networks			0
countries will also be expected to close their borders to their own citizens if they return home after fighting alongside the @entity4 menace			2
president @entity61 , who chaired the council meeting , said it would be ' legally binding			0
' but in reality the @entity197 has no means of enforcing its resolutions , and relies largely on peer pressure and threats of country - to - country sanctions to keep nations in line .			0
