by @entity1 reporter if you thought your home was full of junk , it 's got some stiff competition			2
the @entity8 's @entity7 is made entirely of recycled products , scrap and unused materials from construction sites			1
some 4,000 @entity14 cassettes , two tons of jeans and 20,000 toothbrushes are just some of the items used for the building			0
its architects hope to prove that such matter can compete with more established , high - energy , high - carbon counterparts			0
not so clean living : the @entity8 's @entity7 is made of recycled materials and waste impressive : 4,000 vhs cassettes , two tons of jeans and 20,000 toothbrushes are just some of the items used to construct the building old toothbrushes – many used just once by business class and first class passengers flying from @entity33 – have been used in the wall cavities			1
chalk waste and clay were mixed to create the walls , 500 bike tyres were used to seal windows and soundproof the first floor , while 2,000 used carpet tiles cover the floor and walls , reports refinery 29			2
old vinyl banners were used as internal vapour control layers			0
the project is the brainchild of @entity48 , architect and architectural researcher at the @entity50			1
genius : video cassettes have been slotted into wall cavities to help with insulation in the house waste not : 10 tonnes of chalk waste mixed 10 per cent of clay create the walls , which are covered with tiles , left , while recycled products , such as this light fitting , right , make up the rest of @entity8 's @entity7 he is conducting an experiment into eco-friendly living and seeing if waste materials can serve as the sole insulation in walls			1
according @entity48 , the idea is ‘ that there is no such thing as waste , just stuff in the wrong place			1
’ the project is based on the building that @entity48 created in 2008 with @entity78 from @entity80 's grand designs show			2
the 2008 version of the house - ‘ house that @entity84 ' - was the @entity86 's first contemporary low - energy prefabricated house built using entirely ecologically friendly materials			1
‘ we have , with our students , been designing , re-designing and developing new methods of sustainable construction and new ways of using materials in order to create a truly contemporary representation of the constantly evolving ideas in this field , ’ says @entity48			0
view from above : the house began construction in april and opened for public viewing in june brush of genius : old toothbrushes are used to fill cavities in walls instead of teeth work began on @entity8 ’s @entity7 in april and by june the dwelling was open for public viewing			1
over the next few years , university students will observe the quality of the exterior walls to see if plastic can act as a sustainable insulation material			0
thrown - away bricks , ply sheets and wood from other construction projects , as well as old plastic razors , denim jeans , dvds and video cassettes , have been slotted into wall cavities as insulation , and will be monitored to see how efficient they are			0
the @entity125 aims to prove that low - carbon materials can compete effectively with their more established high - energy , high - carbon counterparts			0
when fully completed , it will be one of the first a * energy - efficient rated sustainable buildings in the @entity86 .			0

@entity8 's @entity7 is made entirely of recycled materials
idea was from architect and architectural researcher , @entity137
' there is no such thing as waste , just stuff in the wrong place , ' he says
