@entity1 frontman @entity0 last night waded into the row over @entity4 's number plate scandal , describing the @entity6 presenter as an ' a * * hole '			1
speaking to fans ahead of a concert in @entity12 capital @entity11 , the singer apologised for @entity4 's behaviour , telling them that he thought the stunt was ' not cool '			1
@entity4 and his team were forced to flee the country last week after locals were incensed by the @entity19 number plate on his @entity20 , which they said was a reference to the 1982 @entity23			1
' making a rude hand gesture , he added : ' he 's a f * * * ing a * * * hole ... not cool			0
' the row erupted when photos of @entity4 's @entity19 registration were posted on the internet by angry @entity12 who claimed the @entity6 presenter was mocking their country			1
the show 's convoy was then attacked by a gang armed with rocks , sticks and pickaxe handles , forcing @entity4 and fellow presenters @entity52 and @entity54 to flee into @entity55			2
@entity4 later took to @entity56 insisting the number plate was a coincidence and was switched to a neutral plate - h1 @entity59 - as soon as the reference to the @entity61 was spotted			1
but @entity12 police yesterday revealed that two further plates were later found inside his abandoned vehicle - one white and one yellow - bearing the registration number @entity66			2
row : @entity4 and fellow presenters @entity54 ( left ) and @entity52 ( far right ) were forced to flee the country last week after locals were incensed by the @entity19 number plate on his @entity20 the discovery throws @entity4 's claims that the plates were a coincidence into doubt after it emerged that the @entity78 has contacted the man who sold them the vehicle in an alleged ' cover - up '			1
a local official said : ' we know bellend does n't mean the end of the bell and is a word used instead to describe the head of the penis which is often employed as an insult in @entity91			0
' we regard it as another insult to the people of @entity12			0
we 're sure the @entity6 team were planning another provocation with the number plate in the same way they provoked us with the one referencing the @entity23			1
' controversy : the anger was sparked by the @entity19 plate , which locals say was a reference to the 1982 @entity23 it also emerged this morning that the @entity6 has told a car dealer who sold the crew the @entity20 to pass on any enquiries about the sale to them			1
@entity112 , of @entity114 - based @entity113 , told @entity115 : ' @entity6 contacted me and gave me the number of their press office to hand to anyone who contacted me			1
' the controversy over the alleged ' cover up ' comes as @entity23 veterans in southern @entity12 announced they would file a formal complaint to a court considering whether to open a criminal investigation for alleged falsification			0
@entity126 , a member of the @entity128 veterans in @entity129 , where @entity4 encountered most problems , confirmed the intention today			0
forced out : the show 's convoy was attacked by a gang armed with rocks , sticks and pickaxe handles he said : ' i like to deal with things diplomatically and i want to see this through to the end and make sure justice is done because you do n't cause offence to our dead and the question of the @entity61			2
' we will be filing a formal complaint to the courts and leaving it in the hands of the judicial system			0
' @entity4 admitted at the weekend the number plate on his @entity20 was changed after the problems he experienced			2
court sources in the city of @entity156 , which is expected to announce next week if it is opening a criminal investigation , say the crime of falsification for using different number plates to those in a car 's official documentation carries a prison sentence of six months to three years			2
under fire : @entity12 @entity167 have now revealed they have found another set of offensive number plates in the car			2
the discovery casts doubt over @entity4 's claim that the original number plate was a coincidence @entity176 , mayor of @entity129 , described last week 's violence , which ended with the @entity6 team being stoned by angry locals as they drove towards @entity55 with a police escort , as a ' great mistake			1
' he said after @entity4 's departure : ' we have committed a great mistake with the violence			0
that never resolves anything and the impact it was going to have was not taken into account			0
' instead of talking today about a person who was trying to be clever , we 're talking about the victimisation of that same person			0
' obviously i do n't agree with violence and smashing windows of a car was n't necessary			0
' i believe the people responsible made a big mistake when they decided to act in that manner because now the news is that they decided to smash up the cars instead of talking about the real issue			0
