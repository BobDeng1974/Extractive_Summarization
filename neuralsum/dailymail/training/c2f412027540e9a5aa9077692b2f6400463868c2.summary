by @entity0 components originating from @entity4 are being used inside @entity6 missiles , a @entity2 report has claimed			1
temperature gauges , pressure gauges and generic resistors manufactured by unidentified companies based in @entity4 were found among debris recovered from the sea after a @entity6 missile test in december 2012 , the @entity7 of experts concluded in an 127 - page report			1
the discovery has led to questions over how @entity4 parts found their way into @entity6 's illegal programme to manufacture intercontinental ballistic missiles - especially as the country is currently under @entity2 sanctions banning the delivery of military goods			1
the @entity38 said the satellite claims were nonsense however , adding that @entity6 had in fact been testing intercontinental ballistic missiles			2
the @entity49 described all the @entity4 parts found in the missile as ' off - the - shelf items that do not meet any of the specifications in the lists of prohibited items , in particular the ballistic missile - related list			1
' the report said that all the @entity4 items had entered @entity6 through third party countries - including @entity60 - with some of them arriving as recently as 2011			1
the report did not name the manufacturers of the items			0
dispute : the @entity38 said @entity44 's claims that the @entity34 rocket was a satellite were nonsense , adding that @entity6 was in fact continuing to test military weapons ( pictured ) evidence : although the foreign parts may have found their way into @entity6 innocently , the @entity2 report said they proved @entity35 's ability ' to assemble complex systems with globally sourced components ' only one foreign item found among the debris met some but not all of the criteria defined by the list of items banned from being exported into @entity6 under the current @entity2 sanctions			1
these were radial ball bearings found inside the turbo pumps of the four rocket motors			2
however the report said these items were likely to have been made in the 1980s in the @entity89 , so could easily have passed into @entity6 long before the @entity2 restrictions were installed			0
although the foreign parts may have found their way into @entity6 innocently , the @entity2 report said they proved @entity44 's ability ' to assemble complex systems with globally sourced components '			1
' the acquisition of components abroad for its prohibited programmes despite its @entity100 philosophy of self - reliance points to the limitations of its own industrial production capabilities , ' the report added			0
ready for action : earlier this week it was reported that @entity6 leader @entity35 told his military chiefs to prepare the nation 's soldiers ( pictured ) for war against @entity110 in 2015 within the report , a number of @entity60 companies and individuals were named as being suspected of purchasing dual - use components on behalf of @entity6			1
the @entity2 said this aspect of the report would need further investigation			0
this is not the first time dual - use components have found their way an international debate about military sanctions			2
in 1998 @entity125 's then leader @entity124 launched ' @entity126 ' - a campaign with objectives that remain unclear to this day but involved plans to build a series of ' superguns '			0
dual - use components have long been part of the debate about military sanctions			0
in 1988 @entity124 launched a campaign to assemble ' superguns ' using metal tubes built in @entity4 ( pictured ) many of the parts for the weapons were made from dual - use items made by various companies in @entity144 - including metal tubes for the barrels and gun cradles purchased from @entity148 in @entity149 and @entity150 in @entity151			2
the majority of the parts were seized in transit and destroyed , but the resulting debate over the export of dual - use items led to more stringent restrictions on what could be exported to countries that were under sanctions			0
earlier this week it was reported that @entity6 leader @entity35 told his military chiefs to prepare for war against @entity110 in 2015			0
according to @entity110 's largest daily newspaper , a source has revealed that the dictator plans to invade and has ordered the army to remain ' combat - ready ' .			0

@entity4 gauges and resistors found among debris of @entity34 rocket
the parts entered the country through @entity60 as recently as 2011
