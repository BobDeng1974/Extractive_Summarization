his sermons , delivered in the courtyard of @entity9 , drew some of the largest and most influential crowds in the country			0
now researchers in the @entity14 have attempted to bring @entity1 ’s sermons back to life by reconstructing the acoustics of the courtyard as it was in 1622			0

‘ we know that large crowds showed up to hear @entity1 ’s sermons , but it was unclear whether they could even hear what was being said , ’ said dr @entity27			0
@entity40 was a preaching cross and open - air pulpit in the grounds of @entity9 in @entity26 it was from @entity40 that @entity1 preached a sermon , on november 5 , 1622 , recreated in the recordings @entity1 was an @entity4 poet , satirist , lawyer and a cleric in the @entity50			1
he was an important religious and political figure in 17th century @entity26			0
due to the reformation and its aftermath , religion and politics were inextricably linked in @entity56 during this period			1
as dean of @entity9 , @entity1 was a prominent man – and his sermons were often made in defense of royal policies , to the most influential crowds in the country			0
‘ by using the models we created for this project , we learned that the courtyard space allowed sound to reverberate , amplifying the voice of the speaker			2
‘ this also means the sermon had to be delivered at a measured pace to keep the speech from being garbled as the reverberating sounds overlapped			2
’ the reconstruction focused on @entity40 , which a freestanding outdoor pulpit where crowds would gather to hear sermons on sundays and special religious days			1
as dean of @entity9 , a focal point of social , political and religious life in the largest city in @entity56 , @entity1 ’s sermons were often made in defence of royal policies			0
and it was from @entity40 that @entity1 preached a sermon , on november 5 , 1622 , that is recreated by the project itself			1
dr @entity27 and his team had to rely on historic documents and images , since the cathedral burned to the ground in 1666			1
they also worked with linguistics and acoustics experts to create a script and acoustic model able to simulate the way the sermon would sound depending on where you are in the churchyard			1
@entity106 : how @entity1 's sermon would have sounded in a crowd of 500 @entity106 : how @entity1 's sermon would have sounded in a crowd of 5000 ‘ we actually constructed two separate models : one for visual representations and one for audio representations , ’ dr @entity110 said			1
‘ the visual model shows a greater amount of the architectural detail that is common to gothic cathedrals			0
‘ the sound model has acoustical properties like reflectance and absorption assigned to the various materials , such as stone , glass or brick			0
‘ these are things that may not be visually apparent in the model , but they contribute to an accurate portrayal of sounds within the space			0
’ while researchers may never know what @entity1 sounded like , dr @entity27 hopes his models will help recreate the experience of @entity139 attending the sermons nearly 400 years ago			2
the project , which is a significant research tool for history , literature and religion scholars , is available online and can also be viewed in a theatre at @entity23 the project aims to answer some longstanding questions about religion and literature in 17th century @entity26 ' this is as close as you can come to visiting 17th century @entity26 and hearing @entity1 speak without a time machine , ' said dr @entity27 , a professor of @entity4 at @entity23 dr @entity27 and his team had to rely on historic documents and images , since the cathedral burned to the ground in 1666			1
shown here is an image of @entity9 as it stands today			0

historic texts and images were used to create a *fly* through of @entity40
recordings reveal how sermon sounded depending on where you stood
