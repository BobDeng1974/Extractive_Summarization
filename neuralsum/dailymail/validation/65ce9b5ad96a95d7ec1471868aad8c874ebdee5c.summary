there 's nothing more destructive than a knee - jerk reaction , whether it ’s a trifling disagreement that escalates into a row or a mouthful of cake that becomes a whole slice , decisions made on the hoof can cause us unnecessary anguish			1
thanks to the frenetic pace of our lives and the constant juggling of friends , family and work , it can seem impossible to put real thought into our actions			1
but now a brilliant new book , 4 seconds , by best - selling leadership coach @entity22 , promises to help you break this bad habit once and for all , thanks to a seductively simple technique			1
here ’s how you can do it ... @entity45 our basic needs — fulfilling relationships , success , peace of mind — are surprisingly straightforward to achieve			1
but in many cases our best efforts to achieve them are built on habits that do n’t work			1
worse , we do n’t even realise we ’re sabotaging ourselves			1
for example , when we feel overwhelmed by a to - do list , our reaction is to work longer hours and pack more into them			1
we multi-task and work late			1
our intention is to reduce stress			1
but , of course , our actions have exactly the converse effect			1
or we say things we think will impress someone , but instead prompt rejection			1
we try to comfort a friend , but somehow make her more upset			1
if we feel overwhelmed by a to - do list often our immediate reaction is to work longer hours and do more , intending to relieve stress , but actually the opposite is achieved ( picture posed by model ) all of these situations could be avoided with just a moment ’s pause to consider the consequences of our actions and make a better choice			1
this is where the @entity81 comes in			1
what is the four - second rule ? the secret to making good decisions that can simplify your life is always to take a single breath — lasting four seconds — before acting			1
it may sound incredibly simple , but that pause has been proven to be all the time you need to reign back your impulses and find the presence of mind to make the smartest choice			1
it allows you the space to breathe and to realise that sometimes not following through on something you want to do is a problem , such as not hitting a deadline or not having that difficult conversation			1
the secret to making good decisions can be a single breath lasting four seconds			1
the pause this takes may be all the time you need to find the presence of mind to make a good choice ( picture posed by model ) but other times the problem is that you do follow through on something you do n’t want to do , such as speaking instead of listening , or playing politics instead of rising above them			1
a four - second break teaches you old - fashioned self - control			1
each time you manage it , you will be proving to yourself that temptation is only a suggestion			2
the four - second rule gives you a chance to question your actions and get the right outcome			1
how to deal with distractions if you ’ve ever tried meditation , you may recognise how unwanted thoughts drift into your mind , interrupting that longed - for sense of peace			2
if you 've tried meditation , you 'll know how unwanted thoughts can appear , when you try the @entity81 identify the impulses that want to take a destructive path rather than ignore them ( picture posed by model ) @entity22 estimates that a new idea will spring into your mind every four seconds , but having an awareness of the way the brain tries to distract itself is valuable			1
when you try the @entity81 , identify the impulses that want to take a destructive path rather than ignore them			2
in the four seconds , try to see another way you could respond to the situation at hand			1
the power of being silent even when you know that taking that four - second pause can help prevent you from making poor decisions , you may find bad habits get in the way of good decisions			1
here ’s how to break them : stop thinking : shut down sabotaging conversations that go on in your head before they start			2
make a decision about something you want to do during the four seconds and do n’t question it			1
for example , ‘ i will work out tomorrow at 6am ’ or ‘ i will say at least one thing in the next meeting at work ’			2
it ’s amazing how effective this is			2
do nothing : when you need to regain your balance - in a contentious conversation or a difficult situation - rather than build your momentum , do nothing for a minute			2
resetting yourself has the power to help you change your perspective on a situation			2
stop thinking and shut down any sabotaging conversations in your head before they start			2
make a decision during the four seconds and do n't question it later ( picture posed by model ) ditch perfection : to get the most important things done without losing your mind , stop trying so hard and aiming for ultra perfection			1
instead , make a pact in your four seconds to race through the next phase of work			1
trust yourself : the next time that you feel insecure about a task or project and are about to reach out for feedback and approval , ask yourself what you think first			2
take four seconds to listen to yourself			1
change the view : if you ca n’t change reality — then look carefully to see it for what it is			2
once your perspective changes , so does your ability to respond strategically and productively to the world around you			2
do n't jump : beware of jumping into things without thinking them through			2
each morning , make the time to ask yourself this question : ‘ am i really prepared for this day ? ’ you may still be ambushed by circumstances or other people , but you ’ll even be more prepared for that , just by asking the question			2
once you ’ve learnt the @entity81 , you can start creating more meaningful relationships with others			2
here ’s how : in the heat of a row with a partner , do n’t respond based on how you feel in the moment ( use the four - second rule ! ) , but rather based on what the other person needs to resolve the situation			0
once they ’ve calmed down , you can move forward			0
do n’t give into your instinct to find flaws in others			0
tame your knee - jerk reactions and instead find something about them that impresses you			0
resist the impulse to write off someone who has hurt or disappointed you			0
most of the time , they are n’t betraying you ; they ’re just struggling with their own issues			0
accept the person and their limitations , and move on			0
contrary to our natural urge to defend ourselves and excuse our mistakes , taking the blame is the power move — strengthening your position , not weakening it			0
accomplish your goals you ’ve mastered the @entity81 , how do you make the most of it ? if we want to sustain a good habit , it ’s not enough just to do it when we remember			0
we have to improve our lifestyle , too			0
many of us start the day with great intentions			0
but then people start calling and emailing , and soon we ca n’t remember what we wanted to focus on in the first place			0
by the end of a week , we ’ve forgotten what it was we were hoping to accomplish			0
and by the end of the year , we ’re frustrated that we have n’t moved forwards			0
master your email if you get involved in a heated email exchange , apply the four - second rule before replying			0
that will let any anger diffuse			0
to improve productivity , check your e-mail only a few times a day - and resist the temptation to check during off e-mail hours			0
if you happen to become involved in a tense email conversation , be sure to apply the four - second rule before replying , giving yourself time to let any anger diffuse ( picture posed by model ) ask yourself : what ’s going on for you ? what are you feeling ? take a deep breath and relax into an undistracted moment			1
streamline your lifestyle identify up to five things that you want to focus on for the year : it could be your work , your relationship or just saving £ 10 a week			0
these priorities are where you should spend 95 per cent of your time			0
take anything that does n’t fit into one of those areas of annual focus and get it off your to - do list			0
create a to - do list that ’s made up of six boxes — one for each of your five areas of focus and the sixth labelled ‘ the other 5 per cent ’ , and pin it to the wall next to a calendar			0
find five things you want to focus on and create a to - do list			0
you should share this with someone else because saying it out loud creates a deeper level of commitment and accountability ( picture posed by model ) that other 5 per cent box is like sugar — a little might be ok , but your day should never contain more than 5 per cent of the activities that do n’t fit into your five main priority areas			0
each morning , take a look at your six - box to - do list and transfer the most important items to accomplish for the day into time slots on your calendar			0
that way , you ’ll make strategic choices about fitting the most important items into your day			0
sit down with someone else — your manager , a colleague , your partner — and show them your six - box to - do list and your calendar for the day			0
tell them what you plan to accomplish and how it fits in with what you want to focus on for the year			0
saying it out loud and having another person hear you creates a deeper level of commitment and accountability			0
