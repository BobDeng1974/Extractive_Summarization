@entity9 's the only @entity10 to watch on thursday , while @entity11 could fall victim to our so far prophetic seed in danger			1

there is only one home prospect in action today and @entity9 faces a tough task second up on @entity23 against @entity24			1
the @entity25 was a semi-finalist here in 2012 , losing in straight sets to @entity30 ’s @entity29 , and is seeded ninth this year			0

home hero : @entity9 lines up on @entity23 against @entity24 in the second round this segment holds a 100 per cent record for predicting upsets so far			1
@entity39 ( no 18 ) , @entity40 ( no 7 ) and @entity41 ( no 12 ) have all tumbled after being flagged as seeds in danger			2
so apologies in advance to @entity11 , who faces @entity46 on @entity47			1
the @entity49 11th seed has history with unexpected defeats and @entity46 is in good grass - court form			2
sorry : @entity11 could be next to fall if @entity0 's prophetic ' seed in danger ' proves right again the third match on @entity56 offers the chance to watch young @entity60 talent @entity58 in action against 31st seed @entity62			1
keys , 19 , won her first @entity66 title at the @entity67 in @entity68 this month and could take out the @entity70 player 13 years her senior			0
