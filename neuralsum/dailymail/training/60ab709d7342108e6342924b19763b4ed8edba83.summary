by @entity0 published : 19:42 est , 30 january 2014 updated : 02:56 est , 31 january 2014 afternoon , sir			1
the name ’s @entity5 , but you can call me @entity7			1
beautiful @entity10 name , @entity7			1
just like the other half , @entity12			1
that ’s @entity12 , as in @entity15 , not as in @entity12			1
would n’t want you getting the wrong impression			1
not that i ’ve anything against it , mind you			1
in my humble opinion , same - sex marriage is the best thing since @entity25 ’s smooth bitter			1
we ’ve just opened a gay bar in the old tap room			1
if you ’re that way inclined , you ’ll find it down the corridor , past the chillax zone and next to the nappy - changing facilities in the gents ’ toilets			1
and we ’ve just started a transgender night , every other tuesday			1
if @entity7 was a pub landlord : mail columnist @entity0 imagines what might have been ... now then , what can i get you ? white wine , or a fruit - based drink ? perhaps a pint of @entity44 for the little lady ? we do n’t go in for traditional stereotypes here , pal			1
most of our gentleman regulars favour a dry white wine , especially our crisp , fair - trade @entity50 from the @entity51			1
either that , or a sparkling mineral water from the @entity54			1
there ’s a lot of spare water in the @entity58 these days , what with the melting of the polar ice caps			1
an old school chum of mine has just set up a bottling plant in @entity65			1
of course , we do our best to combat climate change here at the @entity1			1
you may have noticed the state - of - the - art wind turbine on our roof			1
unfortunately they ’re not working right now , because of the gale - force winds and the flooding , so we ’re on an emergency wood - fired generator			1
if the lights go out , as they do quite often these days , please do n’t panic			1
frankly , all this green crap is a complete waste of time and costs a fortune , but the second - home , @entity85 - reading crowd like it and they spend a lot of money in here of a weekend			1
so , that ’s a quinoa - infused cocktail for you and a pint of wallop for the little lady			1
that ’ll put hairs on your chest , madam			2
and why not ? if a woman wants hairs on her chest , good luck to her , i say			1
or anywhere else for that matter			2
@entity108 is just another form of male chauvinist oppression , that ’s what i ’ve always said			1
if a lady wants to go out for a drink wearing nothing but a skimpy bikini , even though she ’s got more body hair than @entity117 , that ’s entirely her own affair			2
she ’ll be very welcome in here			2
my gaff , my rules ! i ’m sorry , here ’s me rabbiting on and i have n’t asked your names			2
@entity124 and @entity125 ? beautiful @entity10 names			2
and what do you do , sir ? midwife , eh ? that ’s marvellous , a proper man ’s job			2
and the little lady ? do n’t tell me , let me guess			2
chief executive of a @entity137 100 company ? thought so , got it in one			2
@entity12 was a professional woman in her own right , too , until she gave it up when we took over this pub. she helps out lunchtimes when my assistant bar manager , young @entity145 , is on a day off or throws a sickie , which is increasingly often			2
you just ca n’t get the staff these days			2
still , it ’s not for ever			2
we do n’t expect to be here more than five years			2
@entity12 also supervises the food			2
we specialise in organic , ethically sourced , healthy fare			2
low fat , low sodium , low carb , high prices			2
we ’ve got a dedicated vegan menu and only use ingredients grown in our own pub garden			1
unfortunately , we ’re buying frozen veg from @entity161 at the moment , because the garden has been under water since @entity165			2
do you know , we had a geezer the other day asking for pub grub			2
i think he was from the @entity171			0
i told him : we do n’t do pub grub			0
pub grub ’s for plebs , not sophisticated modern metrosexuals			0
grubs is what birds eat			0
the feathered kind , i mean			1
i ’d never call a little lady a ‘ bird ’			0
i barred him on the spot			0
we do n’t want his type in here			0
my gaff , my rules ! if we did n’t have rules , where would we be ? @entity191 ! and just look at @entity191 today			0
seventy - five per cent top rate tax , president @entity193 spending all his time chasing skirt			0
he turned up here yesterday for a pub lunch with the prime minister , @entity197			1
i barred both of them			0
no wonder the @entity191 are all moving to @entity10 in droves			0
we ’re packed out with froggies when the rugby ’s on the big screen			0
they ca n’t get enough of @entity12 ’s five - grain baguette and artisan @entity207			0
it ’s not just the @entity209 , either			0
do n’t get me started on immigration			0
they come over here , they take our jobs			0
good luck to them , i say			1
the more immigrants , the better			0
i ’d far rather employ a hard - working plumber from @entity218 than some of the workshy cowboys we ’ve had over the years			1
no wonder the country ’s flooded			0
we ’ve got a lovely @entity225 woman comes in to do the ironing			1
@entity12 draws the line at ironing and i do n’t blame her			0
@entity230 , she ’s called			0
well , it is now , anyway			0
distant cousins : @entity0 's flight of fancy has been inspired by the revelation that the prime minister , left , and television comedian @entity197 , the @entity238 , share a common ancestor in @entity240 can i top you up , sir ? how about something a little stronger ? absinthe , perhaps ? oh , you ’re driving			1
probably very wise , sir			0
but if i may be permitted a suggestion , why not take a bike next time ? you ’ll find a @entity248 bike docking station outside the front door			0
that way you can drink as much as you like and save the planet on the way home			0
just the bill ? certainly , here you are			0
i ’m sorry , sir , we do n’t take euros , just good old - fashioned @entity257 pounds			1
not even from our @entity191 clientèle			0
that ’s just the way it is			0
my gaff , my rules ! well , not entirely my rules , if i ’m honest			0
most of them come from @entity267 these days , but i ’ve had a word with the @entity269 and we are hoping to renegotiate the terms of our arrangement with our @entity274 suppliers in the very near future			1
who ’s next ? you , the elderly couple			0
sorry to have kept you waiting			0
name ’s @entity5 , but you can call me @entity7			1
and you are ? @entity281 and @entity282			0
and what can i get you ? so that ’s a pint of @entity287 for you , @entity282 , and a large @entity289 chaser			0
and what ’ll @entity281 have — fruit - based drink or dry white wine ? better make it a fruit - based drink if he ’s driving the helicopter			1
look , i ’m afraid you ca n’t smoke in here , @entity282			0
i know , it ’s my gaff and if they were my rules you could smoke like the @entity301			0
they ’ll be stopping us smoking in our own cars next			0
darts ? sorry , no darts			0
they ’ve started sending undercover inspectors to check up and i ca n’t afford the fines			1
it ’s not always easy to spot them , because they wear hi - viz jackets to blend in with everyone else			0
and what do you do ? pull the other one , @entity318			0
if you ’re the heir to the throne , then i ’m the prime minister			1

*genealogists* have discovered that @entity5 and @entity197 , the @entity238 , are distant cousins . both are descended from the @entity326 *novelist* @entity240 , best known for @entity327 . this got me wondering what might have happened if fate had taken a different course . what if @entity197 had gone into *politics* and @entity5 had *embarked* on a career in the *licensed* trade ? we ’ve got a pretty good idea what a @entity238 *premiership* would look like , thanks to @entity341 . but what kind of @entity238 would the prime minister make ?
