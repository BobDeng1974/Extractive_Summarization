@entity0 admits he is struggling to fit into @entity2 ’s new formation this season			1
the @entity4 international - left out of @entity6 ’s squad for the @entity8 replay against @entity9 on tuesday - has made just six starts under the @entity11 and was linked with loan moves to @entity13 and @entity14 in the transfer window			1
@entity0 looked to be getting back to his best form after playing the last two games , and impressed on his first @entity18 start for nearly three months against @entity19 on saturday			1
@entity0 admits he is struggling to fit into @entity2 ’s new formation this season @entity0 was one of the shining lights of the @entity22 era and was rewarded with a five - year deal however , @entity24 has warned that he has to make the most of his undoubted potential and could not even find a place for the teenager on the bench for the fourth round replay			1
@entity24 has largely favoured the use of wing - backs and a midfield diamond since arriving at @entity34 , which is not ideal for his wider attacking players			2
@entity0 played on the left side of the diamond in the win over @entity19 but admits that he prefers the @entity41 role or winger			2
‘ the system really can make it more difficult for me to play there but i have to keep working , ’ he said			0
‘ that is what i am doing in training every day , as i want to get more games this season			2
but under @entity2 the @entity4 international has started just six games @entity0 looks to be getting back to his best form after playing the last two games ‘ my favourite position is as a no 10 or a winger			1
there are lots of players here and i can play in different roles – it ’s just a case of taking my opportunities			0
‘ i ’m not really a wing - back			0
it ’s harder for me because there is more defending involved and i ’m not really a defender			0
’ @entity0 was one of the shining lights of the @entity22 era and was rewarded with a five - year deal worth £ 30,000 - a - week			1
however he has faded dramatically this season and few would have been surprised to see him go out on loan			0
he added : ‘ of course , last year i played a lot of games and every week i was feeling better and better			0
i ’ve not been playing a lot this year but it ’s okay i will try to work hard in training and out on the pitch			0
