by @entity0 published : 11:43 est , 11 june 2013 updated : 19:39 est , 11 june 2013 after waiting nearly 100 years for a suitable suitor , a rare plant has finally produced a family			2
the female wild asparagus was discovered in @entity5 , @entity6 , in 1997			1
but it was the only survivor of the species in the area and , with no male nearby , it could not propagate – unlike most plants , asparagus has separate sexes , so to reproduce a male must pollinate a female			1
experts hunted for a mate , but the endangered wild asparagus is found at only 28 locations across the country			1
the loneliest plant in @entity22 : the rare female wild asparagus has been saved after a specimen in the wilds of @entity6 was mated with a male partner from 175 miles away in @entity27 success : experts from five different agencies worked together to search for the plants , which are now thriving it was n’t until 2006 that experts found a male variety in @entity27 which they carefully moved to @entity6 and then rubbed its pollen on the female ’s stigmas			1
her fertilised flowers then grew , producing bright red berries which each containedsix seeds			0
these were recovered , sowed in pots and grown in greenhouses			0
after two years , 60 plants were deemed to be strong enough to plant out in the wild where they have spent the last five years			2
botanists from five different agencies - the @entity49 , @entity50 , the @entity51 , the @entity52 and the @entity53 - have made fruitless return trips to the site to see if the young plants had flowered			2
but it was n’t until their most recent visit yesterday that they could finally declare the project a success			0
out of the original 60 plants , 51 are thriving and 11 of them - seven males and four females - have now flowered for the first time , meaning they can reproduce			0
wild asparagus is found in only 28 sites in the @entity22 , mainly in coastal areas in @entity27 and @entity69 , and its habitat is being steadily reduced			1
it was thought they were extinct in @entity6 until the female was found but experts said it was only a matter of time before she died out			0
the plant is different from the garden asparagus that is popular to eat because it grows flat along the ground and has smaller spears that have a bitter taste the plant is different from the garden asparagus that is popular to eat because it grows flat along the ground and has smaller spears that have a bitter taste			0
the 60 plants were planted in two groups of 30 ; one on the causeway linking @entity89 and @entity5 alongside the lone female and the other near to @entity92			2
@entity93 , a conservation advisor for the @entity49 , said : ' it has taken them quite a while to mature but at long - last they are starting to flower which means they can sustain themselves			1
' although there are only 11 of them flowering at the moment , the key thing is that both male and females are flowering on both sites			0
' we are confident it will only be a matter of time before the other young plants come into flower			0
' the aim is to secure the population of wild asparagus in @entity6 and we are very hopeful that that is going to happen			1
' @entity116 , an ecological surveyor at the @entity53 , said : ' we brought up a @entity27 boy to have a bit of fun with our @entity6 girl in 2006 and since then it has been a waiting game			2
' because their natural habitat is in an exposed , hostile environment like sea cliffs it has taken the seedlings a bit longer to grow and start to flower			0
' to stand any chance of long term survival , a wild asparagus colony needs to contain plants of both sexes			1
' any colony reduced to a single plant is ultimately doomed to extinction			0
' the males have a different size and shape of flower			0
' as well as conserving a rare and endangered plant , it is hoped the genes from the wild asparagus could be introduced to the garden variety to make them more drought tolerant			1
wild asparagus appear to benefit from the @entity149 , the sea current that keeps the south west relatively warm , which is why they are found in coastal areas			1
painstaking : the female plant produced 60 seeds which were carefully propagated in a greenhouse and then planted in the wild			2

the rare female wild asparagus specimen has successfully mated
it was paired up with a long - *distance* male partner in @entity27
offspring have been planted in the wild , preserving it from extinction
