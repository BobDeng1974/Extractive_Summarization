by @entity0 and @entity1 the @entity2 came down almost 25 years ago			2
but in one leafy corner of @entity5 , the @entity3 lives on			2
a 300ft - long fence , thrown up by millionaire farmer @entity7 to keep dog - walkers off his land , has led to a bitter showdown with locals who treasured their strolls across the wild meadow			1
yesterday they gathered to make their first public protest at what they say is now a grim , metal corridor reminiscent of a @entity20 prison boundary			2
the six foot high fence that has been erected along a field in @entity23 , @entity24			2
the fields known locally as the @entity26 have been used by families opponents are demanding that mr @entity7 – who bought the field at @entity23 , @entity24 , eight months ago – rethinks the height and appearance of his 6ft - high spiked fence			1
he says he is merely trying to protect and contain his stock , prevent dog fouling and keep scooter - riding youths from using it as a racetrack			1
however , it appears the former haulier and beef farmer woefully underestimated the thwarted fury of @entity5 ’s ramblers when he erected the fence over the @entity44			2
last autumn the meadow was bought at auction by local businessman @entity7 for £ 210,000 the six foot high fence in @entity23 , @entity24 allows a small corridor for ramblers to walk through wind turbines and solar panels are one thing			1
but obstructing the views of a muddy track said to have been used for three generations amounts to a declaration of war			2
as @entity59 ’s @entity58 almost said , they can take our lives but they will never take our footpaths			2
owner : @entity7 ( pictured ) bought the meadow at auction for £ 210,000 last year @entity66 , who heads the opposition , has battled for months to persuade the 64 - year - old farmer to lease the land – @entity70 – back to the community			1
she and a host of fellow residents had previously raised £ 100,000 to buy it at auction , only to be blown away by mr @entity7 ’s bid of £ 230,000			1
the 48 - year - old charity fundraiser said : ‘ people have been walking across these fields for 50 years			1
the local primary school used to come here on field trips , but no more			2
‘ i really do n’t understand why he ’s done this			2
he says he wants to grow hay and graze his beef cattle but why make it look like a @entity20 ? ‘ if he really wants to keep dogs off , what ’s wrong with a good old - fashioned barbed wire fence ? ’ mr @entity7 , who recently sold his haulage business , bought the 29 - acre plot last september after the previous owner – who had happily allowed open access – died			1
mrs @entity66 – who has walked here for 20 years – added : ‘ we were all pleased when mr @entity7 bought the land because he was bidding against a property developer			1
‘ but , of course , now we all fear that he will one day develop this land			1
why else spend a quarter of a million pounds on it ? ‘ the tragedy is that this was one of the last great , green spaces in the town – these fields were the green lungs of @entity23 and now they ’re lost to us for ever			2
mr @entity7 wo n’t even talk to us any more and we are powerless – it ’s so frustrating			1
‘ mr @entity7 told me he bought the land as a means of keeping his money safe after he sold his haulage business			1
‘ we fear he may plan to develop the land at some point but , to be honest , it ’s not that well suited to building houses on			1
‘ there are power lines overhead and the train track runs alongside			0
but it ’s a lovely place , full of wild flowers , that we all hold dear			0
’ dozens of locals yesterday braved torrential rain to picket the fence , including @entity126 and @entity127 , their eight - year - old son @entity128 , and two - year - old labradoodle @entity129			1
the couple have walked here every week for 13 years			0
@entity133 mr @entity132 , 53 , said : ‘ in the old days we ’d probably have turned up with pitchforks – now our worst weapon is a dog whistle			1
@entity137 has erupted over metal fencing in @entity23 , @entity24 installed across wildlife meadows that were at the centre of a public campaign last year to save them ‘ but if this chap did n’t think he was doing something wrong , why put the fence up almost overnight , in secret ? and this thing is just hideous			1
‘ no one in their right mind would think that open fields are the place for threatening metal spikes that belong in a military prison			0
‘ he has ruined this lovely place			0
and for what ? a few bundles of hay and a dozen cows			0
’ architect @entity159 , 48 , added : ‘ this is a beautiful landscape and the most alien thing you can imagine has utterly ruined it			0
’ wine merchant @entity163 , 46 , has also been walking here for 13 years			0
he said : ‘ it ’s a disgrace			0
the fence is an eyesore , a scar on the landscape that has no business here			0
‘ as well as putting up the fence , mr @entity7 has demolished a beautiful hedgerow			1
‘ the community is up in arms			0
we all need to protect our green , open spaces			0
there is absolutely no need for a high - security - style fence in open countryside			1
what next , razor wire ? my children have played here happily all their lives			0
this man has destroyed a thing of beauty			0
’ town clerk @entity188 , 50 , said : ‘ i went to see mr @entity7 when he first bought the fields to see if we could reach some arrangement			1
‘ we had managed to raise £ 100,000 so we thought we might be able at least to buy half of the land but he turned us down flat			1
i do n’t know why he wants so much land – 29 acres is a huge area to graze cattle on and there ’s no money in hay			1
’ mr @entity7 bought the land after @entity201 rejected a bid to protect the area by mrs @entity66 ’s action group @entity203			1
the group attempted to register the open pasture as a community asset , which also failed			0
the group then asked mr @entity7 to keep the walkway clear but his response was to erect the fence , insisting walkers stick to the designated path			1
mr @entity7 claims he built the fence to protect his livestock from the risk of disease posed by dog faeces – and to protect dogs and walkers from his cattle			1
he told @entity221 : ‘ i chose the design for health and safety reasons			0
if i ’d used wood or wire , people would have just cut it or knocked it down			0
then i would have animals wandering on to the road and railway line			0
the truth is that walkers have been trespassing on that land for years			2
if they had cared for it properly i might not have needed a fence like this			0
‘ but they allow their dogs to mess everywhere and me and my staff have to work in it			0
‘ i thought , “ they do n’t look after it , so i will			0
” i went to the footpath people and asked if i could put a fence up and they said it was my right , so i did			0
‘ we ’ve also had people camping rough on there and taking on mopeds and scooters late at night			0
it has been horrendous for the local residents but we have now sorted the problem out			0
’ and one resident last night welcomed the fence			0
@entity257 , 80 , whose garden abuts the entrance to the path , said mr @entity7 was a ‘ saviour ’ who had restored peace to the area			1
she said : ‘ it ’s been lovely to walk out of my door these past few weeks and not be confronted by piles of dog mess			2
‘ neither are we woken up at 6am by people slamming their car doors and shouting good morning to each other			0

businessman @entity7 bought the 29 - acre plot for £ *280,000* last year
previous owner who allowed free access to the land has died
mr @entity7 is trying to contain stock , prevent dog fouling and keep scooter - riding youths from using it as a racetrack
