returning @entity1 goalkeeper @entity0 has been warned he has to handle the pressure if he wants to be a success at @entity4			1
@entity0 is poised to make his first @entity1 start for three weeks on monday night against @entity5 having been axed by @entity6 following the club ’s @entity8 exit three weeks ago			1
the 26 - year - old @entity10 has faced heavy criticism this season but has won a reprieve because of a thigh injury picked up by rival keeper @entity15 at @entity16 on @entity17			1
but the @entity1 boss says his players have little choice but to accept being under the spotlight at such a big club			2
‘ like everyone , @entity0 has had a wee bit of flak			2
but to operate at this level , you have to be able to deal with that , ’ said @entity6			2
‘ he came on against @entity16 and had a couple of edgy moments , and he will recognise that			2
but it will help his confidence to keep a clean sheet			0
that is what he wants as a goalkeeper and what we want as a team			0
‘ this is an opportunity for @entity0 to prove his worth			2
’ @entity0 fails to stop the ball crossing the line as @entity1 concede a goal at @entity61 @entity0 is beaten by @entity63 player @entity62 during a @entity8 encounter at the other end , @entity65 — currently playing as @entity1 ’s main striker — has been set a target of scoring 15 goals this season by @entity6			1
@entity65 is filling in for @entity71 while @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 struggle for goals and scored the winner at @entity16 for his sixth goal of the season , having netted 10 times last term			1
‘ he knows his job is to create goals and score goals and he ’s doing very well at the moment , ’ said @entity6			2
‘ between 10 and 15 would be a good return for him			0
the boy is a natural winger and if he gets those figures on a regular basis it ’s a very good number for him			0
‘ you ’ve other players who are out - and - out no 9s but as his career matures i think he will show he ’s got that ability			0
’ @entity65 celebrates after scoring @entity1 's match - winner in the @entity17 win over @entity16 @entity65 uses his pace to carry the ball past @entity16 goalkeeper @entity97 at @entity28 the @entity98 international then places the ball into the net as @entity97 and his defenders look on helplessly @entity102 also believes @entity65 will blossom into a top striker over the coming years — and stay at @entity4			1
@entity65 has two - and - a - half years left on his current £ 35,000 per week deal but @entity1 have been in talks with his advisors about offering him improved terms to reward the outstanding progress he has made			1
there have been some reports that @entity1 ’s offer is not what @entity65 ’s advisors feel he is worth , but @entity102 is not concerned			0
the @entity114 said : ‘ i ’ve been lucky to play with some of the best strikers in the world and i can say @entity65 has all the qualities to be up there			0
@entity102 and @entity0 shake hands after the goalkeeper was introduced for @entity15 at @entity16 ‘ technically he has top quality			1
i do n’t think the things being said about whether he will sign a new contract will affect him			0
i also do n’t think it will be about money			0
@entity65 will make a decision based on what he feels is right			0
‘ i think he will stay because he has been so well looked after at @entity1			0
’ monday night ’s clash with @entity5 will pit @entity6 against two players @entity1 might have signed — @entity130 and @entity131			1
@entity5 skipper @entity132 has also been linked with a move to @entity4 and @entity6 said : ‘ he is a top - class international centre half			1

@entity0 will start in goal for @entity1 against @entity5
he was *dropped* three weeks ago for @entity15 following poor displays
but @entity15 sustained a thigh injury in @entity1 's 1 - 0 win at @entity16
@entity6 has *challenged* @entity0 to step up to the plate
the @entity10 has been criticised for slack *performances* this season
