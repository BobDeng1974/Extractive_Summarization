meaningless : education consultant @entity6 has called for the term ' minority ' to be scrapped because it labels people in an interview with the @entity25 , dr @entity6 said : ' " minority " should be the badge that people are trying to rip off			1
' instead , in the case of certain musicians , authors and others , it can bring you money and fame			0
this is a corruption and a deceit			0
' we need to ditch gay pride and black pride			0

and he argued that teachers should stop reinforcing cultural identities by allowing youngsters ' rap versions of @entity58 ' rather than reading standard @entity59 and @entity60			1
he said : ' too often what poses as cultural identity is , in reality , ignorance or bad education			0
' @entity66 and other children need to be schooled in the lexicon of the mainstream , where " street talk " is not seen as another version of @entity60			0

barrier : mr @entity6 believes ' gay pride ' had originally been about fighting for equal rights , not establishing a separate ' community ' ' i love rap music , by the way , but it should n't be a defining feature of young black men			1
' he claimed that the ' biggest barrier ' to his own success had been goals was allowing his minority status give him a sense of ' victimhood '			1
pointing out none of the children working with his charity wanted to feel like they belonged to a minority , he said : ' in fact , as part of the course , we deprogramme them from thinking they 're locked into an ethnic community			1
' we want them to be defined by what they know , not what they look like			0
' dr @entity6 added : ' of course , racism is also a constraint on certain groups and we need laws to protect us from the excesses and evils of mankind			1

' speaking today , dr @entity6 moved to qualify the details when he said : ' these terms were used in the 70s to help us in the struggle against inequality , but it 's been turned around			1
' when people were locked out of opportunities these terms were useful , but they 're not useful now , particularly in a complex society like the @entity138			2
' i 've no idea what you can define as ' black ' now because people are so mixed			2
i do think it 's got lost on its way from a framework of political liberation to where certain people almost get benefits from it			2
' young people in particular , if they 're going to access opportunities , what 's the biggest barrier ? and that barrier 's the status that 's around them , put upon them and sometimes the one they attach themselves to			2

bullying : @entity170 claims 55 per cent of gay , lesbian or bisexual youngsters experience victimisation ' that leads to instances of suicide , self - harm and mental health problems and that 's the real reason that holds people back			1
' what we 've seen on the news in the past few weeks is the situation in @entity195 , and dozens of countries that persecute , criminalise and terrorize gay people			2
' what we 've got to do in @entity138 is show that we 've not forgotten there is still a huge amount of work to do			0
