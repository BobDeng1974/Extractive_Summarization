the last time @entity1 embarked on a @entity2 in @entity3 , they prepared with three days at @entity4 and took a 31 - hour flight with four refuelling stops , while their most famous player was sent elsewhere on a goodwill mission			1
on reflection , it is probably no great surprise that the 1950 campaign has gone down as an object lesson in how not to win the @entity2			1
the defeat to the @entity15 in @entity16 remains the biggest humiliation amid all the other failed attempts to land the famous trophy as @entity1 stepped into the unknown on their first campaign with staggering complacency			1
farewell : @entity1 prepare to board the plane ahead of a 31 - hour trip to @entity3 ahead of the 1950 @entity2 on sunday they will once again depart for @entity3 and these days @entity25 has a vast support staff , hi - tech training facilities and luxury accommodation to assist his plans			1
but 64 years ago , the first @entity1 manager @entity30 did not even pick the team			1
@entity25 ’s players first met up two weeks ago for a fitness camp in @entity34			0
they moved on to @entity35 in @entity36 for tactical preparation ahead of last night ’s farewell game against @entity39 with all eyes fixed on the opening game against @entity42 , in @entity43 , on june 14			0
more than 70 strong , the @entity45 party will fly first to @entity46 for more warm - weather training and two friendlies , then on to @entity49 next weekend			1
all smiles : @entity1 players including @entity52 ( second left ) , @entity53 ( centre ) and @entity55 ( right ) inspect the contents of a suitcase back in 1950 , @entity1 won friendlies in @entity34 and @entity59 at the end of a season in which @entity62 were crowned champions			1
as all the @entity65 clubs asked were busy re-seeding their pitches , they reconvened at @entity4 ’s ground in south @entity68 for light training on june 14 with only 11 days to go before the first @entity2 group game			2
‘ we played a couple of seven - a - side games and that was it , off we went , ’ said @entity30 , who noted that the @entity72 clubs had given up their players six months earlier , according to his biographer and son - in - law @entity75			2
elsewhere : sir @entity78 flew to @entity79 to spread @entity45 goodwill @entity75 ’s book recounts how @entity30 had told his mother @entity82 : ‘ there is a lot expected of a grand lot of players and myself			1
do n’t be too hopeful of us bringing that cup back , but we are all very optimistic and we will do our best			0
’ the @entity1 squad flew in a @entity91 on a flight lasting 31 hours , with refuelling stops in @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 before arriving in @entity49			1
the @entity45 party was 17 players , four referees , two trainers , eight sports writers and the manager			2
players were on the @entity45 standard rate of £ 20 per game			2
@entity30 ’s salary was £ 1,000			0
@entity78 , who was 35 and had not won a cap for more than a year , flew instead to @entity79 to spread @entity45 goodwill and @entity109 took @entity110 and @entity111 on a tour to the @entity15 before they were released for @entity2 duty			1
@entity1 arrived in @entity49 with five days to spare			2
they trained in the morning and evening at @entity115 ’s ground in the city centre and stayed on the @entity117 in the @entity118 , recommended to the @entity45 by @entity119 , after they had toured @entity3			1
the manager , however , did not seem impressed			0
‘ it was so hot that the players were exhausted , even in the hotel , ’ said winter - bottom , who banned swimming in the ocean and ruled the beach out of bounds after 10am			2
‘ it could n’t have been worse for us			0
when @entity119 were there it was an end - of - season jolly , more or less a holiday			0
’ @entity78 made it to @entity3 on the day before the first game , so he was left out of the 2 - 0 win against @entity135 in @entity49 ’s @entity136 , which was still swarming with workmen			1
@entity30 said it ‘ resembled a building site ’			0
some things do n’t change and it was not the only parallel to be drawn			0
@entity1 ’s best centre half was in exile as @entity145 had been banned after moving to the newly - formed @entity147 league , outside @entity148			1
humiliation : @entity1 goalkeeper @entity149 ( left ) looks on as @entity150 scores to give @entity15 a 1 - 0 win over @entity1 in @entity152 other things have changed			1
‘ the food was terrible , ’ said @entity78			2
‘ we were just eating bananas mostly			0
’ @entity157 was on tap for the players at half - time			2
captain @entity161 said : ‘ we gave it a test but found it of little use			0
perhaps it was the difficulty to breathe which was directly responsible for my feeling leg - weary in the second half			0
’ @entity78 was available but the sole team selector @entity170 decided not to make any changes for the second game against the @entity15			1
@entity25 ’s team will return to @entity16 to face @entity174 and can only hope the outcome is less embarrassing			0
@entity1 flew north from @entity49 and stayed nearby in the mining village of @entity177 as guests of a @entity180 gold mining company			2
they limbered up with a friendly game of cricket against the @entity183			0
ready : the @entity1 team , including @entity185 ( top row , second left ) , pose ahead of the defeat to @entity189 at the stadium , changing facilities were so poor that @entity30 took his players off to change at the nearby @entity193 before walking back to the ground			1
inside , the pitch was small and dry and bumpy and @entity1 lost 1 - 0			1
the only goal was a header by @entity150 , a @entity198 who would return to his native island in the @entity201 , where he was later executed by the @entity203 regime after disappearing in 1964			0
@entity30 grumbled about the referee who seemed to have missed a header by @entity53 crossing the line before it was scooped out by a hand - not one belonging to the goalkeeper - but this was 60 years before @entity210 in @entity211 and the incident which hastened goal - line technology			0
besides , it was not the only issue			0
@entity1 realised they had come up short and that the @entity2 was unlike anything they had experienced			1
they would lose their final group game to @entity189 and the plane taking them home to @entity68 was 24 hours late taking off			0
there is scope for improvement on all levels .			0

last time @entity1 travelled to a @entity2 in @entity3 , the *journey* consisted of a 31 - hour flight and four stops
@entity78 man @entity78 travelled to @entity79 to spread @entity45 goodwill rather than attending the *tournament*
@entity1 **'s** defeat to @entity15 remains biggest humilation in @entity1 **'s** bid for *glory*
