@entity0 is hoping to make up for lost time after rediscovering his scoring touch for @entity2			1
the striker made his second appearance following nine months out with a ruptured cruciate ligament as the @entity2 took on @entity6 in the third round of the @entity8			1
@entity0 came off the bench with half an hour to go and converted @entity11 's cross in the 73rd minute to earn @entity2 a 1 - 1 draw and a replay at @entity14 next week			1
@entity0 celebrates scoring the equaliser against @entity6 in their @entity8 third round clash @entity0 was making his second appearance after nine months out with a serious cruciate injury it was the 25 - year - old 's first goal since a penalty in a 2 - 0 victory over @entity23 on march 25			1
four days later , @entity0 suffered the injury early in a match against @entity26 , but the 21 goals he had already scored played a major role in @entity2 's promotion			1
he made a brief comeback on @entity31 against @entity32 but had to endure more frustration because of illness			2
that was all forgotten as the ball flew past @entity6 goalkeeper @entity37 , and @entity0 is now hoping to make his mark in the @entity39			1
the @entity40 said : ' it puts nine months ' work into perspective			2
it was a great feeling to get back out there and score			2
' i was a bit gutted over the @entity49 period			2
i got on against @entity32 and then picked up a chest infection			2
i 've only had a couple of sessions since the illness and it 's knocked me back a little bit			2
@entity0 arrives to side foot his shot beyond @entity37 for 1 - 1 @entity11 , who delivered the cross for @entity0 ' goal , is tackled by @entity6 ' @entity60 ' it was great work by @entity63 down the right - hand side			1
i saw he was heading to the byline , he pulled it back and it fell right to me so it was nice			0
' there was a lot of emotion			0
they all came over and congratulated me and there were a few nice comments afterwards			0
it does mean a lot			0
' you go through some hard times mentally and physically in the gym and when you 're stuck on the sofa , but it 's nice to come out the other side and hopefully i can kick on now			1
' there was a bittersweet tang to @entity87 ' achievement , though , after the news his team - mate @entity89 had suffered the same injury			1
the defender had played just 20 minutes of @entity39 football when he landed awkwardly during @entity2 's 3 - 3 draw at @entity95 last week			1
it was announced on tuesday that @entity89 had signed a new contract keeping him at @entity2 until 2017 , and @entity0 will do all he can to help on the long road ahead			1
' i would n't wish that injury on anyone , ' said @entity0			1
and when you get that phone call , i remember where i was , and it 's not nice			0
@entity2 's @entity89 ( right ) goes down with a similar knee injury to that suffered by @entity87 @entity89 left the field on a stretcher against @entity95 ... @entity0 said he ' would n't wish that injury on anyone ' ' i spoke to him the night he got the news , talked him through it			1
it 's a tough one to take			0
' but it 's a strange kind of mentality because you get your head round it as soon as you get the information , it 's going to be a nine - month thing , and then you try to crack on			0
i think he 's heading down for the op this week and i wish him all the best			0
' fifteen or 20 years ago you 'd be lucky to get back out on the pitch			0
you look for inspirational stories and there 's a lot out there now			0
' with @entity2 's squad depleted by injuries and @entity6 facing two games a week for the rest of january , a replay was probably the last thing either team wanted			1
but boss @entity135 insisted the prize of a fourth - round tie against @entity26 is one that @entity6 will give their all to secure			2
of his side 's hectic fixture list , the @entity139 said : ' i am not concerned			0
i 'm confident in our squad			0
all our players are in good physical condition			0
' it 's true that i am a little bit disappointed because we need to play another game			0
' i think we need to stay in the @entity8 and get to the next round			2
our priority is to stay in all the competitions and to be competitive			0

@entity0 scored as @entity2 forced @entity8 replay with @entity6
it was @entity87 second appearance for the @entity2 after nine months out
