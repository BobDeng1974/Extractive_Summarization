by @entity0 an elderly cancer patient died of an overdose the day after a gp prescribed morphine over the phone , an inquest heard			1
dr @entity7 failed to carry out a home visit to see 80 - year - old widow @entity9			1
the next day , she was inadvertently given double the recommended dose of the opiate by her daughter , @entity12			2
@entity9 , 80 , died of a morphine overdose the day after dr @entity14 allegedly refused to carry out a home visit			1
her daughter , @entity12 , called the @entity4 because her mother was in agonising pain due to her cancer a medical expert said this amounted to ‘ gross failure ’ , as morphine should not be prescribed to anyone for the first time without a face - to - face consultation			1
@entity27 coroner @entity26 recorded a verdict of misadventure after a two - day inquest and is reporting the doctor to @entity33 bosses over the death which took place in march , 2010			1
mrs @entity12 said afterwards she felt at one time as if she was being blamed for her mother ’s death			2
she said : ‘ i am just so glad someone listened			0
i am pleased something is going to come out of it			0
‘ from now on when you ring a doctor they should come out and do a visit			0
that should be the proper procedure			0
‘ when they told me she had died from the morphine i felt i ’d be blamed			2
at the end of the day i was managing her pain relief , but it was an accident			0
’ mrs @entity9 , from @entity27 , was suffering from breast cancer and had been in agonising pain for four days when her daughter called the @entity57			1
she asked dr @entity14 to visit her mother , but he rang her back and said he would instead send a prescription for @entity59 to a chemist			0
instead of carrying out a home visit , dr @entity14 prescribed morphine over the phone			1
this was administered by mrs @entity9 's daughter , @entity12 ( pictured posed by model ) the inquest heard that the chemist failed to include the right size spoon for administering liquid morphine			1
mrs @entity12 broke down in the witness box as she insisted she had requested a home visit from the gp			1
she gave her mother the medication in an attempt to ease her pain but she died as a result - the prescription was for 10ml up to four times a day but mrs @entity12 admitted using a dessert spoon to give her as much as 70ml the day before she died			1
a pathologist said mrs @entity9 died from morphine toxicity			2
dr @entity14 told the inquest he had asked questions of mrs @entity12 and ‘ listened to what was reported ’ before he decided the only option available was morphine			1
he swore on oath about the telephone call			0
he said : ‘ she did n’t ask me for a home visit			2
i was responding to a request for a patient who was in pain			0
’ but dr @entity93 , an independent medical expert , said mrs @entity9 had not been seen by a doctor for six months and she had never before been prescribed morphine			1
he said : ‘ the bottom line is that this patient needed to be seen and assessed			0
i think with a patient like mrs @entity9 who was elderly and infirm it was mandatory			2
‘ this amounted to a gross failure			0
i do n’t think to prescribe morphine was appropriate			0
without going to properly assess the patient it was a serious deficiency			0

@entity9 , 80 , was in agonising pain due to her breast cancer
