by @entity0 for @entity1 sickness caused by wind turbines is not a real illness , a controversial new report has claimed			1
instead , symptoms such as nausea , dizziness and migraines are simply imagined by those living nearby , say @entity12 scientists			2
compiled by the @entity14 in @entity15 , the report says ill - health blamed on turbines is merely the result of the ‘ nocebo ’ effect			1
a report has found that claims of sickness being caused by wind turbines ( stock image shown ) are not being upheld by courts around the world			1
the study carried out by the @entity14 in @entity15 found that evidence was not strong enough to support the claims ' @entity31 ' refers to an alleged medical disorder in which people who live in close proximity to turbines begin experiencing a wide array of symptoms , such as tinnitus , dizziness , migraines and insomnia			1
the name was coined by dr @entity43 , a pediatrician from @entity44 whose husband has been lobbying against the proliferation of wind energy			0
in 2009 , @entity48 self - published the book ' @entity31 , ' which included case studies of people who reportedly got sick as a result of their proximity to wind farms			2
the wind turbine syndrome , dubbed by @entity43 the green energy industry 's ' dirty little secret , ' is not recognized by the @entity58			1
@entity60 's research has come under fire from industry experts , who accused her of possibly skewing the data by looking at a small sample size without a control group and failing to submit her results for an impartial peer review			0
this is a term for something that creates a negative reaction in a person , despite there actually being nothing to affect their health or well - being			0
as it ’s name suggests it is the opposite of a placebo			0
experiments relating to the nocebo effect in the past have found that people will perceive themselves to be sick if they are told that something could have an adverse effect on them			1
for example , a @entity88 scientist once gathered a group of volunteers and asked half to watch a video on the ‘ dangers ’ of @entity94			0
when both groups were then seated near a fake @entity94 amplifier they believed to be real , only the group that had watched the video reported any adverse effects			2
the new @entity12 report reveals how court cases against wind turbines in five @entity105 countries have been regularly dismissed			2
in 49 cases brought to court in the @entity12 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 and the @entity111 , 48 were dismissed as having no basis to their claims			0
and the only winning case , in @entity116 , @entity117 , related to noise caused early in a turbine ’s operation that apparently caused grievance to some nearby residents			2
‘ these claims about wind turbines causing health impacts are not being upheld , which means there is n’t sufficient evidence to prove that wind turbines cause any problems with human health , ’ said @entity123 , the nonprofit ’s executive director , according to @entity125			2
‘ that ’s a big deal , because claims about that are used across the globe by anti-wind advocates to try to slow the development of wind farms			0
’ and the paper adds : ' the courts have spoken			0
wind farms do not cause health problems			0
' the belief that wind turbines can cause sickness , known as ‘ wind turbine syndrome ’ , was made popular in 2009 by @entity12 paediatrician dr @entity43			1
but @entity149 , @entity151 ’s director of external affairs , told @entity1 : ' dozens of independent , peer - reviewed scientific studies carried out both here in the @entity111 and around the world have consistently proved that there ’s absolutely no credible evidence that wind turbines have any adverse effect on anyone ’s health			1
' however , despite these claims mps in the @entity111 are warning homeowners that a nearby wind farm could cut the value of their houses by up to a third			0
@entity168 , the chairwoman of the anti-wind farm campaign group @entity170 , says she has seen the value of a number of properties slashed thanks to the presence of a nearby turbine			0
some people have reported having ' wind turbine syndrome ' , an alleged disorder where people who live near turbines suffer from symptoms like tinnitus and migraines			1
however it is not recognised as a medical condition by @entity58			1

claims of sickness caused by turbines not upheld by worldwide courts
study carried out by the @entity14 in @entity15 found that evidence was not strong enough to support the claims
this suggests that people are simply experiencing a ' nocebo ' effect
*phenomenon* occurs when people are told something will make them sick - and even if the claims are false , some will suffer adverse effects from it
this can lead to ' wind turbine syndrome ' , an alleged disorder where people who live near turbines suffer from symptoms like tinnitus and migraines
however it is not recognised as a medical condition by @entity58
