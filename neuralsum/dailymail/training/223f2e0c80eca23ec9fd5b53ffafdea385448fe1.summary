( it was 80 percent in @entity29 ! ) , ' the researchers said			2
' @entity30 are acceptable for women ( 45 percent of top - ranking straight women used them , as did 4 percent of lesbians ) , but not so much for men			2
' source : @entity36 the chart shows 380 of the top 1000 most commonly used words in profiles on @entity26			2
' working with data crunchers at the dating sites , we analyzed the 1,000 most popular words on both men and women ’s profiles , tabulated the most popular movies and tv shows , and crunched stats on what people consider their best feature vs. what features their potential dates are attracted to , ' the team at @entity41 said			1
the team also analysed the 400 most popular profiles , and found there were keys to which profile pictures worked best			1

' if you ’re a gay man , pose outdoors — 48 percent of the profile pics of the most popular gay men on @entity26 were snapped outside			1
( it was 80 percent in @entity29 ! ) , ' the researchers said			2
' @entity30 are acceptable for women ( 45 percent of top - ranking straight women used them , as did 4 percent of lesbians ) , but not so much for men			0
' ' mentioning cats is fine , but mention ' my cats ' and you ’re a weirdo			0
' the data shows that lesbians appreciate nice legs , gay men prize nice arms , and straight women and men are looking for flat stomachs above all else			0
' why are outdoor photos of men likely to be more popular , but less so for women ? men prefer indoor - selfies of women because they look pretty in them - the lighting is flattering and soft , and the whole mood of a home selfie is intimate and slightly private			0
it 's sexy ! women prefer outdoors shots of men because they 're likely to be taken by a friend ( which shows that he 's social and popular ) , and probably show him doing something active and rugged ( which we also like )			0
why are profile pictures with more than one person in them a turn - off ? at @entity117 , we 've found that people simply do n't have time to study a photograph to work out which one is you ! it 's also far less intimate and attractive to use a group shot - always remember that the person viewing your profile will be trying to imagine themselves with you			1
not you and your legions of friends			0
it 's the online equivalent of bringing your mates along on a first date			0
why should you speak more about your own interests than what you 're looking for in a partner ? because people viewing your profile will be hoping to get a sense of your lifestyle - and how they can fit into it			1
they do n't want to feel like an item on a supermarket shelf that you might simply pass by because it 's not on your list			0
describe yourself as a person - how you like to spend your time , what you love to do			0
why is spelling important ? good spelling implies you 're intelligent but more importantly it shows you 've taken care and effort writing your profile			1
a hastily - written page full of abbreviations suggests you 're not taking it seriously , or that it 's something you flung up online while you were bored			0
that suggests you wo n't take dating seriously either			0
good spelling shows that you are thoughtful and considered .			0
