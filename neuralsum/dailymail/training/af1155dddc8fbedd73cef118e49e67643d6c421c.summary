the @entity1 killers and the fanatic who died in a gun fight in a @entity5 kosher grocery store are all part of the same terror gang which flourished in the heart of @entity5 and whose tentacles spread to hate preachers @entity11 , @entity12 , and top leaders of @entity14 in @entity15 and @entity16			1
both @entity17 , one of the brothers behind the massacre of 12 at the @entity5 satirical magazine and @entity21 , who held up to ten hostage on friday in a kosher supermarket , are graduates of the @entity26 gang – named after the @entity5 park where they were radicalised more than ten years ago			1
the revelations that @entity17 and @entity21 - both killed on friday afternoon - were in contact with some of @entity33 's most notorious fanatics will only raise more questions of the @entity37 authorities ' failure to stop wednesday 's atrocity at @entity1 's office and the carnage that has followed			1
but in the early 2000s , members of the gang were considered ' pioneers ' of the foreign jihadi movement , raising money for terrorist attacks and sending fighters to @entity62			2
named after a park in the 19th arrondisement , the members were young and disaffected : @entity17 has been described as a ' loser ' working as a pizza delivery boy during the period into drugs , girls , petty crime and alcohol			2
they appear to have first come to the notice of the police during protests against the @entity62 war ; later , members would be jailed for a range of offences linked to terrorism			0
and it was while in prison that both @entity17 and @entity84 found a new mentor : @entity43 , a key @entity14 leader of recruited terrorists when he worshipped at @entity46 's @entity45			1
former @entity88 informant @entity87 described @entity43 as a ' constant presence ' at @entity45 in the late 1990s			1
he said he was particularly close to extremist preacher @entity12 , but also mixed in the same circles as @entity11			2
@entity11 was jailed for life by a @entity93 court today after being convicted of international terrorist offences			2
but @entity96 's influence was felt on both sides of the @entity98 , having lived in @entity99 for several years after moving his family from @entity37			0
@entity43 is said to have recruited shoe bomber @entity101 and @entity102 , the ' 20th hijacker ' in the attacks of september 11 , 2001			2
he openly admitted meeting @entity104 as he recruited @entity106 jihadists to fight in @entity107 , and was jailed in 2005 for plotting to bomb the @entity109 embassy in @entity5			2
prison pals : @entity111 and @entity43 pictured playing football together in 2010 , after @entity17 was released link : @entity17 ( left ) and @entity21 were both implicated in a plot to free jailed @entity115 ( right ) @entity116 : @entity21 was killed after @entity37 special forces raided a kosher deli where he was holding hostages @entity88 informant @entity87 told the @entity121 : ' there is no doubt that you can see the influence of their teachings in him			1
' their warped view of the world has filtered down through him to a new generation			0
' what happened in @entity5 was the legacy of @entity12 and @entity11			1
' a completely new generation , who have never met these people in @entity46 , have learned their ideology indirectly and are now willing to die in jihad			0
' the two young men maintained contact with @entity141 after being released from jail : @entity17 was secretly photographed by @entity37 intelligence officers meeting @entity43 while he was under house arrest in @entity145 in central @entity37 in april 2010			1
according to @entity37 police reports , @entity21 also made secret visits to @entity43 's home after his release from prison			1
@entity17 , who was jailed twice for terrorism - related offences , in 2005 and 2008 , was photographed playing football and exercising with @entity43 in prison by surveillance teams			1
but it was a plot to free another jailed @entity115 which first clearly linked @entity21 and @entity17			1
both men were killed this afternoon after police stormed the supermarket and office where they had been holding hostages claimed links : @entity43 allegedly recruited the shoe bomber @entity101 ( left ) and @entity102 ( right ) , the ‘ 20th hijacker ’ in the 9/11 attacks , at the @entity46 mosque @entity115 was a leading members of the @entity170 terrorist group @entity169 , or @entity171 , and was behind the attack on a suburban station which left 30 people injured			1
both men would be named suspects in the 2010 plan , while it would @entity43 who would later be named as the person behind the failed scheme			0
however , it would be another member of @entity26 who gave the brothers the strongest link to what is now the world 's most notorious terror network , @entity16			1
@entity188 was a member of @entity26 , and was jailed alongside @entity17 in 2008			1
like @entity190 , he lived in the 19th arrondisement , and became radicalised as a teenager			0
@entity193 , who is of @entity195 origin , was to become a key figure in recruiting young @entity37 @entity197 to fight in @entity62 , and both he and @entity17 rejoined the @entity14 network in @entity62 on their release from prison			1
@entity188 ( right ) was a member of @entity26 , and is now a commander with @entity16 yet while @entity17 seems to have kept a relatively low profile in the past few years , @entity193 has risen to prominence as a fighter with @entity16			1
he claimed responsibility for the 2013 murder of two @entity195 left - wing opposition politicians , claiming responsibility for it in a video released by @entity16 last month			2
' we will return and kill several of you , ' he warned			0
' you wo n't live in peace until @entity195 applies @entity217 law			0
' @entity218 , an expert at @entity219 in @entity5 , told the @entity121 this link would have been crucial			0
' it is impossible an operation the scale of the one that led to the massacre at @entity1 was not sponsored by @entity227 [ @entity217 name for @entity16 ] , ' he said			1
however , a witness quoted by @entity5 newspaper 20 minutes as saying one of the assailants cried out before getting into his car : ' tell the media that it is @entity14 in @entity15 ! ' this too is eminently possible , although this time is is @entity238 who is believed to have strong links to the group , known as @entity241 ( @entity14 in the @entity242 )			1
radical : @entity43 attended the prayer meetings held by hate cleric @entity12 ( pictured ) in @entity46 @entity238 is said to have met leading the @entity109 - born @entity14 preacher @entity245 during a trip to the middle eastern country in 2011			1
the @entity15 source said @entity238 , 34 , was among a number of foreigners who entered the country for religious studies			0
' we do not have confirmed information that he was trained by @entity14 but what was confirmed was that he has met with @entity245 in @entity256 , ' the source said , noting that he could have been trained in one of the large parts of @entity15 not under the control of the authorities back in 2011			1
@entity241 emerged as one of @entity14 's most aggressive international affiliates and a direct threat to the @entity109 , when it claimed responsibility for an attempt by a @entity268 man , @entity267 , to down a @entity270 - bound airliner on december 25 , 2009 with a bomb concealed in his shoe			2
it said it was also behind a foiled plot to send two air freight packages containing bombs to the @entity109 in october 2011			0
however , @entity245 - who was seen as an influential international recruiter to the @entity14 movement - had been killed the month before in a drone strike widely attributed to the @entity279			2
the mass murder at @entity49 's hands appears to have taken the @entity37 security services by surprise			0
there are suspicions he may have been written off as a ' failed jihadist ' after reverting the low - level crimes and chaotic lifestyle of his youth			0
experts suspect a @entity37 - @entity195 jihadist now fighting for @entity16 could link @entity49 and @entity295 militants occupying swathes of @entity62 and @entity297			2
@entity188 claimed responsibility last month for assassinating two politicians , @entity300 and @entity301 , in @entity195 in 2013			0
@entity302 was previously part of the @entity305 network alongside @entity49 and experts believe @entity295 must have played some role behind the sophisticated attack			0
@entity218 , of @entity5 's @entity310 university , said it is ' certain ' that @entity295 is following events closely and may well be preparing a video claiming responsibility			0
suspicions that @entity295 were aware of the attack were heightened by a mysterious tweet by a jihadist 24 hours beforehand			0
reading simply : ' snail eating people ' it was followed by a second message ' you heard it here first # snaileaters ate lead ' posted within hours of the shooting			0
in a further development , a senior intelligence source revealed @entity328 met @entity14 preacher @entity245 during a trip to @entity15			1
the official said the terrorist suspect travelled to the country for ' several months ' in 2011 with several other foreign fighters			0
@entity245 , who was killed in a drone strike in september of that year , is one of the most influential @entity336 figures of modern times			0
his huge catalogue of videos and audio sermons remain a grim inspiration for islamists in all corners of the world			0
the @entity15 source said : ' we do not have confirmed information that he was trained by @entity14 but what was confirmed was that he has met with @entity245 in @entity256			2
' the southern province of @entity256 is a lawless area where @entity14 militants and the security forces have clashed in recent years .			0

two of the terrorists who brought carnage to @entity5 were mentored by @entity43 , a key @entity14 leader , in prison
@entity43 recruited terrorists at a @entity45 mosque and was linked to hook - handed hate preacher @entity11 and @entity361
