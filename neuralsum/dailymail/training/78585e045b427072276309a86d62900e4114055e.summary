by @entity0 last updated at 5:07 pm on 14th december 2011 the iconic black bull that looms over roads across @entity3 - and is now its unofficial national symbol - could soon be coming to a street near you			1
the brandy firm behind the legendary advert is planning to let its @entity9 out of the corral to roam main roads across @entity12 , @entity13 and the @entity14 it means the 14 metre high billboard - seen by millions of tourists to the @entity18 each year - could soon be popping up on the streets of @entity20 , @entity21 or @entity22			1
@entity23 , in the @entity14 , and the @entity25 capital of @entity26 have already stated a firm interest			1
@entity9 pr director @entity44 spoke of the company 's dream at the opening of its fourth @entity49 in @entity50			2
he said he saw ' no reason ' why the @entity52 could not stretch its legs across the world			2
he said he had already received requests from @entity23 , in the @entity14 and the @entity25 capital of @entity26			1
but introduction of the bulls to @entity59 may spark protest , however , with many animal rights activists associating it with bullfighting			2
but this , @entity64 has previously protested , is not the case			0
he argues that the hoardings , which stand prominently on hillsides across @entity3 , are simply an advert for the company			1
the @entity9 sprang up in the 1950s as @entity3 , recovering from the @entity71 , started the rough and rocky road from poverty to the developed world			1
while the classic rectangle boards were shooting up , @entity9 , the @entity76 based brandy firm , decided they wanted something a bit different			0
@entity80 ? this @entity9 , near @entity81 , is one of 94 billboards placed by the brandy firm loved : the @entity84 are frequently defaced ( left ) but the firm always restores them to their original state , which is now a huge brand , selling t - shirts ( right ) , keyrings and other merchandise and that was certainly what they got when marketing genius @entity94 came up with the idea of a silhouetted billboard depicting one of the ' toros bravos ' or ' brave bulls ' used in bullfights - with the company 's name emblazoned across its side			0
in 1957 more than 50 were placed on hill tops across the country , alongside adverts for soap powders , @entity14 fizzy colas and kitchen appliances			1
location : there are 94 bulls in @entity3 territories the shadow they cast shortly became synonymous with @entity3			1
it was ironic that @entity94 , a staunch communist , created a symbol which was taken up and used by the fascist right - wing @entity121 government			1
the first batch of bulls were wooden , had white horns and stood four metres high			2
but the weather soon took its toll and four years later , in 1961 , they were replaced with seven metre high sheet iron versions			2
the @entity84 ' first brush with the law came just a year later when two @entity132 dictats ordered billboards be located at least 125 metres from main roads			0
it seemed the @entity84 were being returned to their corrals , but to make sure they could be seen @entity9 gave them some feeding pills and grew them to 14 metres tall			0
by this time there were 90 toros across the country – all the way from @entity141 to @entity142 – with the most in the @entity144 province			0
but their freedom was short - lived			0
come the 1980s and @entity3 was embarking on a crash course to democracy - and the newly empowered @entity150 government declared war on hoardings blotting the landscape			1
as the eyesores started to be torn down , thousands launched a campaign to save the silhouettes from destruction			0
they argued they were a tourist attraction , despite the fact many had had their gonads and / or heads smashed off by vandals and anti-bullfight protestors			0
remarkably , in those @entity168 pressure days , president @entity166 relented and decided the @entity169 , as they affectionately came to be known , could stay			0
the one condition was the name of the company had to be removed from the bull ‟ s stomach			2
the firm agreed as its brand name was already associated with the @entity84 and the campaign had given them more inches of newspaper print across the world than they could ever have dreamt of			0
now , it is the symbol of the country across the world , donned proudly by @entity3 on their holidays - and even worn by tennis star @entity32 when the football team won the @entity35 in @entity36 in 2010			1
the company was founded in 1772 by an @entity59 , the @entity189 wine importer @entity190 .			0

@entity14 city of @entity23 and @entity26 in @entity25 are keen for bull to arrive
