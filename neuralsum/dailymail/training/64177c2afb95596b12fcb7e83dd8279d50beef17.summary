by @entity0 footage has emerged from @entity2 showing a meteor exploding as it enters the atmosphere and lighting up the night sky			1
in the short clip , recorded on a car 's dash camera , a bright object can be seen streaking across the sky before breaking into pieces and disappearing			2
the scenes are reminiscent of the 2013 @entity2 meteor which exploded in the sky over @entity15 , shattering glass in nearby buildings and injuring 1,200 people			1
witnesses in @entity2 's northern @entity23 say that , unlike the previous meteor , there was no audible explosion when the bright object appeared at roughly 2.10pm local time			1
the @entity15 meteor , which crashed to @entity41 in february 2013 weighed 10,000 tonnes , according to scientists , and was 55ft wide			2
when it exploded the force was so great it sent shockwaves around the world twice before punching a 50ft - wide hole in the surface of a frozen lake			0
the light flares up , illuminating the surrounding buildings , before disintegrating and fading away while many believe the object to be a meteor , others have pointed out that the @entity2 military have a base nearby and have suggested that it could be a missile test the tremors from the explosion above @entity15 city were recorded at around 20 monitoring stations across the world			1
the stations are part of the @entity67 network operated by the @entity68			0
collectors were quick to the scene where they collected fragments of space rock before trying to sell them online , some reportedly fetching thousands of pounds			0
earlier this year @entity2 included fragment of the meteor in medals which they handed out at the @entity78 to mark the anniversary of the rock falling to @entity41			0
a meteor occurs when an object from space , usually rock , gets dragged into the @entity41 's atomosphere by gravity , burning up as it encounters friction			0
the clip is similar to dashcam footage captured in 2013 of a meteor exploding above @entity15 on that occasion a huge explosion blew out glass in surrounding buildings , injuring 1,200 people			1
witnesses to the latest ' meteor ' say there was no sound as the object fell to earth			0
