there was something very frightening happening at @entity2 on saturday			2
something terrifyingly real , something tremendously ominous			2
that ’s the case if you happen to be in the homes of mr @entity7 , @entity8 or @entity9			2
looking back on a comeback win against an impressive @entity13 , the residence of @entity11 will be a very serene place indeed			1
why ? because two of his summer gems – @entity18 and @entity19 – are showing more than a fleeting glimpse that they could become the next great @entity22 double act			1
these two signings could prove the difference between @entity27 going close – see may for details – and clinching a title			1
four years ago , the last time they lifted the crown , there was @entity42 supplying @entity43			2
this duo is different , but threatening something just as devilish			0
@entity11 congratulates his new star striker @entity18 after he scored a hat - trick on saturday 1			1
@entity49 3 @entity50 , the numbers			0
- @entity18 is the only player in @entity22 history to notch seven goals in his first four games , beating @entity55 and @entity56 ( both six )			1
- the striker has two more already than a certain @entity58 managed in the entirety of last year			0
- @entity19 is the first player in the top - flight to have ever bagged an assist in six consecutive games ( including his last two matches for @entity64 )			1
- @entity18 ’s goals have come from 10 shots on target and he is the first player to find the net in his first four games for @entity27 since @entity71 in 1928			1
it is easy to be blinded by figures , dazzled by the breaking of records			0
in this case , though , those are merely a pleasing by - product to a blossoming relationship that will only mature with age			0
@entity19 ' brilliant start to life at @entity27 will also have pleased his manager @entity11 @entity19 and @entity18 have played together for @entity84 but their partnership is still relatively new the signs at the @entity2 were that @entity19 and @entity18 mean serious business , and @entity11 knows it			1
the manager dealt with questions about the performances of both with the type of nonchalance a man who expects this type of dynamism on a regular basis serves up			0
@entity27 have been accused of extreme mechanism under the @entity101 but that is now redundant			1
the @entity103 managed to weed out the deadwood and have taken on more exuberance			0
the golden pair are at the heart of this new - look @entity11 outfit			1
when @entity18 comes short , @entity19 threads a ball into feet ; when he spins a defender , the playmaker looks to go over the top			1
the understanding on saturday was akin to team - mates who had been together for seasons			0
while they have played together for @entity84 , the sharpness with which they have engineered lightning intuition remains remarkable			0
@entity121 and @entity122 formed a deadly partnership together in their years at @entity125 @entity126 provided plenty of assists for @entity58 when they played together at @entity130 @entity121 showed something similar in his final seasons at @entity125 by providing for the clinical @entity122			2
@entity133 and @entity134 fired @entity64 to two titles in three years , including the famous invincible season , while @entity126 and @entity58 formed a deadly duo at @entity130			0
more recently , @entity138 and @entity55 have helped @entity139 to their first two @entity22 titles			1
none of those partnerships showed such early promise as @entity27 ’s , though			2
@entity19 assisted two of @entity18 ’s hat - trick against the @entity146 – adding to when they combined against @entity147 – and there is a real belief in @entity150 that the boss has hit the right note			2
@entity134 and @entity133 played brilliantly together to lead @entity64 to their invincible season in 2004 he spoke of waiting for the ‘ right ’ striker to come along – reaffirming that @entity27 bided their time in bidding for @entity18 , instead of jumping head first into a condensed and inflated market last year			1
they had to watch nervously as @entity159 flirted with @entity19 in 2013 too			0
good – or proficient – things seemingly come to those who wait			0
‘ those two together are as good a partnership as i ’ve seen in a long time , ’ was the assessment of @entity163 on the @entity164			0
even at this early stage it ’s difficult to disagree			0
@entity138 and @entity55 are the latest partnership for @entity19 and @entity18 to try and emulate @entity11 must take more than a portion of the plaudits after this display			1
he saw that @entity19 was itching to impact the game higher up the pitch – and was actually caught out of position during a timid first half			0
the @entity178 shone in a more advanced role and it could be that he takes up that station from the start too often – impeccable service into @entity18 dictates that .			2

@entity18 has scored seven goals in his first four games for @entity27
@entity188 has provided an assist in all of his last six @entity22 matches
@entity11 delighted with his pair of new signings
