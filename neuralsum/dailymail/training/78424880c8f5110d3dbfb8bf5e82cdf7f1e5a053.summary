she lost her eyelids , eyebrows and some of her hair in the assault			1
@entity24 : @entity6 , 21 , said today it ' feels so good ' to have her eyebrows back after her face was badly damanged in a random acid attack since then , surgeons have painstakingly rebuilt her features including taking skin from the back of her ear to make new eyelids for her			1
but her eyebrows remained permanently damaged			2
before the incident , @entity6 described herself as a ' girly girl ' who would spend three hours getting ready to go out in the evening			1
having already suffered so much from the attack , knowing her eyebrows would never grow back was yet another blow to her confidence			1
now , ten months on , her skin has healed enough for her to have her eyebrows restored			2
@entity6 had a sophisticated semi-permanent make - up treatment that tattoos on the eyebrows as individual hairs , mimicking the effect of real brows			1
delicate technique : semi-permanent make - up expert @entity46 pencils in the brow before using the tattoo needle to ensure the shape is right the cosmetic procedure was carried out by the expert @entity52 clinic on @entity54			1
@entity46 said she had loved working with @entity6			2
she said : ' we recreated @entity6 ’s brows with my fame technique , which builds up the brow at microscopic level , hair by hair			1
' first we pencilled in the brow and got the correct shape for @entity6 ’s face			2
' when she was happy with the shape , we began to build up her brows and as you can see from the pictures , the results were perfect			0
' the key is to simulate the appearance of the natural hair – so that you can see the individual hair strokes in the new brow			0
' colour is implanted into the skin – it is very sophisticated form of cosmetic tattooing			0
' @entity46 , who also worked with @entity80 after her acid attack , also specialises in scar and skin camouflage and areola reconstruction – for breast cancer sufferers who have undergone mastectomies			1
@entity6 's semi-permanent brows will last between nine months and a year before she requires a top - up			1
she says : ' they are beautiful – i ’m so pleased i had it done			0
' pioneering technique : @entity46 has developed a technique to draw on hairs individually to mimic real brows			0
she uses a similar technique to recreate areola on women who have had mastectomies now , in her first public appearance since february , when she movingly described on breakfast show this morning how her life was turned upside down when she was doused in sulphuric acid , @entity6 reveals on camera the extent of her suffering - and how she has managed to rebuild her life			1
@entity6 faces further intricate laser surgery as doctors strive to lessen the impact of her scars and reconstruct her face , using the same methods used on @entity114			2
she said : ' it has been very difficult to come to terms with			0
' my doctors have been brilliant but it will take years of laser surgery to repair my face			0
' there is only so much you can do at any one time – then there is long healing process before you can undergo the next stage of the treatment			0
' it is only now that i had been able to have semi-permanent make - up on my face			1
' girly girl ' : before the attack @entity6 said she would spend three hours getting ready for a night out ' i loved having the treatment – it feels so good to have my eyebrows back			1
' what i loved about the treatment was its intricacy – it is a form of cosmetic tattooing			0
it is the closest you can get to mimicking the appearance of the original brow			0
' in the video below , @entity6 can be seen having the treatment in video – as well as the moment she weeps for joy when she sees her new brows			1
@entity6 smiled : ' i did get a bit emotional when i saw them			2
it ’s the first time i have seen myself with eyebrows for almost a year			0
' @entity6 is on leave from her job at @entity156 lingerie store at @entity16 shopping centre in @entity158 , @entity159 , while she recovers			2
she eventually plans to return to work and pursue her dream of becoming a make - up artist			1
@entity6 , from @entity159 , is still at a loss to explain why she was targeted			2
she said : ' i asked , " why me ? " i work hard , i ’m a good person			0
' i ’m the same person now but stronger			0
brave : @entity6 , who last night won an award for bravery at the @entity169 , said of her attacker , ' they can burn by skin but they ca n't burn my soul ' ' i want to say to my attacker , " you can burn my skin but you ca n’t burn my soul			1

' i just started running straight home			0
i knew it was acid			0
it feels like something is eating way at your skin			0
i felt it most on my scalp , more than my face			0
' she arrived at her home shouting and banging on the door , screaming ‘ acid , acid			0
’ her family came to the door thinking she was excited about something			0
then when her mother opened the door , @entity6 said everyone ’s faces ‘ just dropped			2
