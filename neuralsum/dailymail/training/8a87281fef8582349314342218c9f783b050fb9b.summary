by @entity0 published : 09:24 est , 12 march 2013 updated : 19:42 est , 12 march 2013 backbench @entity2 mps have been ordered by their party ’s hierarchy to stop attacking the prime minister on @entity6			1
they were urged to exercise more caution when tweeting to avoid damaging the @entity2 ’ general election prospects			2
@entity2 strategist @entity9 met @entity1 last night with @entity10 to discuss their tactics for the 2015 poll			2
ticking off : @entity2 mps are to be told to stop speculating on @entity6 about @entity10 's chances of wining the next election backbenchers were told to refrain from criticising the party ’s policies and leadership in the wake of the disastrous @entity21 by - election which saw the @entity24 relegated to third behind @entity25			1
no 10 has reminded mps that they are ‘ participants , not commentators ’ after a string of tweets were seen as ‘ distracting ’			2
mps were told instead ‘ to get out the message that we have created one million extra private sector jobs , that net migration has reduced by a third and that crime is down			0
these messages are being drowned out			0
’ one of the mps who regularly criticises @entity38 on @entity6 is dr @entity39			1
help or hindrance ? @entity40 mp @entity39 and @entity42 mp @entity41 are among the @entity2 backbenchers to use @entity6 to criticise the party leadership within two hours of @entity47 reporting on the warning from @entity49 to @entity2 @entity1 that they are ' participants not commentators ' , dr @entity39 took to @entity6 to insist she would not be silenced , including the message : * * * * * * * dr @entity39 then deleted the message , and reposted it without the asterisks when home secretary @entity54 made a speech over the weekend that was widely seen as a leadership pitch , dr @entity39 reinforced the idea that mr @entity10 was in trouble			1
she tweeted that the @entity49 ‘ inner circle still look far too posh , male and white ’ adding that ‘ @entity10 is running out of time to fix it ’			0
on monday night , she tweeted : ‘ we do n’t need a leadership challenge but i would challenge the leader to change his advisers			0
’ @entity2 election guru @entity9 will tell mps that they must focus on key messages like job creation and reforming welfare then after word got out that @entity2 mps were encouraged to stop tweeting criticism of the pm , dr @entity39 tweeted the message ‘ * * * * * * * ’			1
former whip @entity41 is another prolific tweeter			0
the mp was openly discussing his party ’s problems during the @entity21 by - election , tweeting that many of the policies trumpeted by @entity25 were @entity2 ideas but voters did not realise this ‘ because of mixed messaging ’			1
the pm has become a late convert to @entity6 , following his pronouncement in 2009 that ‘ too many tweets might make a t * * t ’			2
now officials at @entity88 are encouraging mps to follow his @entity6 messages			0
when mr @entity10 tweets , they are urged to retweet the message to their own followers			0
last night @entity94 vice-chairman @entity93 said : ‘ things are so bad for @entity10 that he is reduced to gagging his own backbench @entity1 on @entity6 because he ’s fearful that they might tell it how it is			1
‘ this is a weak and increasingly out of touch prime minister desperately trying to stop his divided party imploding			1
’ but @entity2 mp @entity102 said : ‘ there are some people who are openly talking about challenges to the leadership			2
they should all be quiet			0
’ @entity107 questioned why mr @entity10 had taken so long to ' catch up ' with backbench opinion on @entity109 @entity111 mp @entity110 , a frequent critic of mr @entity10 , urged the @entity73 to realise more right - wing policies would be popular while his colleagues post a stream of comments online , the @entity73 uses his account for more mundane messages , like this one from a visit to @entity119 in @entity120 yesterday			0

no 10 has grown increasingly annoyed at *conservatives* using @entity6 to air their *grievances*
backbenchers will be told they are ' participants not commentators '
@entity94 says it is a desperate attempt stop @entity2 party ' imploding '
@entity40 mp @entity39 becomes first @entity2 to defy @entity6 *ban* , insisting she will speak out even if ' *inconvenient* ' for the leadership
