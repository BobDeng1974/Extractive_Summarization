by @entity0 @entity2 police are investigating whether a video posted on @entity4 shows a genuine kidnapping or a hoax			2
the video was taken on may 18 and purports to show a young man crossing a street in @entity9 and narrowly miss being hit by a car			1
in a fury , he throws a drink at the vehicle and swears at its driver			1
the young man on the zebra crossing remonstrates as the car is obviously not going to stop and indeed it illegally runs the zebra crossing			1
the unamused young man throws his drink at the vehicle , which stops abruptly the occupants of the car get out and the young man makes his point rather than running away the car screeches to a halt before three men get out , rush up to the pedestrian , grab him and hurl him into the boot and drive off			1
the whole scene was captured on video by the dashboard camera of @entity37 , 22			2
he said : ‘ the police have quizzed me time and time again about this , asking whether i thought it was genuine or a stunt			0
they asked why i uploaded it to the internet			0
‘ all i can say is that it looked like it was the real deal and , no , i was not in on the kidnapping			0
i had no time to react			0
it was all over very quickly			0
i pity the poor guy who was bundled into the boot because the guys who took him looked big and menacing			2
’ the man in the vest and rather too tight shorts grabs the young man and forces him to the floor			1
the man in the white t - shirt and the one in the @entity60 top look on the other two men look initially bemused as their friend grabs the young man but then decide to join in then getting in on the ' action ' , one opens the boot while the others bundle the young man inside after mistakenly putting the car into reverse , the driver shoots off up the road with @entity37 , 22 , continuing to film the ' incident ' a police spokesman said : ‘ we have to take it seriously as a potential crime and are now appealing to social media users to ask if they can identify either the men or the car or the victim			1
‘ the only reservation we have is that the video seems too perfect and that it might have been a set up			2
we wo n't know that until all our enquiries have been exhausted			0
’ mr @entity37 added : ‘ i think it 's real , i hope the police find him – and in one piece			0
