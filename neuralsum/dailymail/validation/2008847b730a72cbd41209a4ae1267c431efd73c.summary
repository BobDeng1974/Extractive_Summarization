supermarkets have been accused of ' bully boy tactics ' by offering their suppliers bank loans instead of swiftly settling their debts			1
chains including @entity6 and @entity7 have introduced schemes that delay the payment of invoices to small businesses that supply them with goods			1
the suppliers have to wait up to a month longer to have their bills honoured , but if they can not hold on this long , the supermarkets offer them access to credit from a bank			1
it pays the money earlier than the supermarket would – but charges interest on the loan			0
supermerket chains have introduced schemes that delay the payment of invoices to small businesses meaning many farmers will face a cashflow crisis critics say such schemes force small firms to pay through the nose to get money that should have been handed to them promptly in the first place			1
@entity37 , chief executive of the @entity38 , said last night : ' this is yet another ethical deficit at the heart of some of @entity43 's most well - known companies			0
their apparent collusion in this area threatens to break the backbone of the @entity43 economy – small businesses			0
' @entity6 , for example , has a ' supplier finance ' scheme with @entity52			2
under arrangements introduced late last year , most of the supermarket 's suppliers have been persuaded to wait 90 days for their invoices to be paid , a month longer than previously			1
those that can not hang on that long are directed towards the deal @entity6 has drawn up with @entity52			2
the bank will give them their money sooner in the form of a loan			0
@entity6 has a ' supplier finance ' scheme with @entity52			2
the bank can give suppliers their money sooner in the form of a loan @entity52 earns interest charges , @entity6 keeps the cash it owes in its coffers for longer – and the firms pay to get their money			1
a @entity6 supplier , who wished to remain anonymous , said it is the latest example of big business using ' bully - boy tactics ' to make an extra profit			1
the practice is legal , but the supplier said it can be the difference between some small businesses surviving or failing			0
mr @entity37 said : ' there is a growing trend for large businesses to use supply chain finance to extend payment times and pass the cost of credit down to their suppliers			1
1 a supermarket decides to buy apples from a farmer and agrees to pay him £ 10,000 every month			0
2 a year into the contract the supermarket says it is keen to work with the supplier for another 12 months – but rather than settle the invoice monthly it would prefer to hang on to the cash for longer and delay payment to 90 days			1
3 the farmer does n’t want to upset the supermarket but suddenly finds himself with a cashflow issue – if he ca n’t pay his bills his business could collapse			0
4 the supermarket comes up with a solution			0
it has devised a scheme with a bank that means the farmer can get paid even quicker than 30 days but at a cost			0
a bank will pay the money owed in the form of a loan , but will take a fee for providing the cash ‘ early ’ – typically interest of 1.2 per cent , or £ 120 per month			2
5 so the farmer only receives £ 9,880 rather than the £ 10,000 he is owed			0
' this is a process which , whilst reducing their own costs , also makes money for the bank supporting the scheme			0
' the finance deals are not compulsory , but many suppliers feel it is an offer they can not refuse for fear of losing business			0
one supplier , who asked for anonymity , said @entity6 and others are being opportunist introducing the schemes at a time when interest rates are low			1
he said he fears they will rocket when borrowing costs start to rise , but by then small firms will be locked into costly deals			0
@entity6 ' deal with @entity52 allows the supplier to receive payment earlier if they pay interest at 0.75 per cent above the @entity153 benchmark rate , currently 0.27 per cent , meaning a charge of 1.02 per cent			1
other grocers offer similar schemes , but they are not tied to suppliers agreeing a lengthening of payment terms			1
@entity7 offered a scheme with @entity161 and @entity162 , offering borrowing rates of 0.95 per cent above the @entity153 rate			2
@entity7 increased the waiting time for suppliers before their bills are settled from 60 days to 75 for clothing and ' general merchandise ' in 2013			1
food suppliers wait between 19 and 39 days			1
@entity6 said : ' if suppliers do n't want to take part , they do n't have to			2
' @entity52 said the deals let suppliers get cash at low cost , and helps businesses to ' free up capital to invest in their business '			0
@entity7 said : ' we have only received positive feedback from suppliers that participate			2
' @entity184 's , @entity185 and @entity186 also offer similar schemes , but @entity188 does not .			0
