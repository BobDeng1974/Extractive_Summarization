@entity0 missed the chance to climb out of the bottom three as an unfortunate own goal from @entity3 gave high - flying @entity4 the points			1
@entity7 's 64th minute shot struck @entity3 and crept over the line before goalkeeper @entity9 could scramble it clear to make it a seventh game without a win for @entity15 's side			1
the @entity0 stayed in the relegation zone as a result , failing to capitalise on the team immediately above them , @entity19 , having a free saturday			1
@entity0 keeper @entity9 is unable to stop @entity3 's unfortunate deflection crossing the line to make the score 1 - 0 to @entity4 @entity9 dives desperately , but his final touch on the ball occurs after it has crossed the line and the goal stands the @entity4 players celebrate @entity3 's own goal from @entity7 's initial shot ; it was enough to give them all three points @entity0 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity9 6 ; @entity3 6 , @entity29 7 , @entity30 6 , @entity31 6 ; @entity32 5.5 , @entity33 5.5 ; @entity34 6 , @entity35 6 ( @entity36 90 ) , @entity37 7 ( @entity38 75 ) ; @entity39 5.5 subs not used : @entity41 ( gk ) , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 booked : none @entity4 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity47 8 ; @entity48 5.5 , @entity49 6 , @entity50 6.5 , @entity51 6 ; @entity52 6 , @entity53 6.5 , @entity54 5.5 ( @entity55 61 ) , @entity56 6.5 ; @entity57 5.5 ( @entity58 90 ) , @entity59 5.5 ( @entity60 90 ) subs not used : @entity62 ( gk ) , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 goal : @entity67 ( 64 ) booked : none referee : @entity70 7 attendance : 17,388 @entity72 : @entity47 ratings by @entity74 @entity3 's heat map sees plenty of forward - thinking play from the @entity0 right - back , but he was unable to atone for his own goal as the @entity0 lost 1 - 0			1
click here for more stats , pitch maps and analysis in our brilliant match zone @entity35 , criticised by @entity86 last week for his ' criminal ' tackle on @entity88 was twice denied by excellent stops from @entity47 while @entity0 's appeals for a penalty against @entity49 were waved away			1
as expected , @entity15 named @entity35 in his starting line - up despite last weekend 's furore in which the player was blamed by @entity86 for the tackle that led to @entity88 being sent off for retaliation			1
the huge cheer from @entity100 's faithful when @entity35 ' name was read out over the tannoy before kick off showed clearly where their loyalties lie			0
aiming to build on a creditable draw at @entity106 , @entity0 made their traditional fast start at home with @entity34 warming the hands of @entity47			1
@entity4 , missing playmaker @entity110 with a hamstring injury , were taken aback and unable to get their posession game going early on			2
@entity35 looks on in despair as @entity3 's deflection crosses the line - the @entity0 defender can be seen ( left ) head in hands @entity119 makes a terrific save from the shot of @entity35 to keep the scores level at 0 - 0 in the first half former @entity123 shot - stopper @entity47 had an impressive afternoon ; he kept a clean sheet to earn @entity4 three points when @entity59 tried to get down the left with an electric burst , @entity29 showed commitment to the cause with a perfectly - timed tackle with his outstretched leg			1
the first clear opportunity of the game fell to @entity35			0
he had a chance to become a real hero when a @entity39 ' shot deflected and spun into his path six yards out			0
@entity35 turned sharply and hit it first - time well enough , but credit has to go for @entity47 who spotted the danger and came out of his goal quickly enough to spread himself and make a block			2
@entity37 then dribbled past two defenders before causing mayhem in the @entity4 box as the hosts pressed purposefully for the first time around the half - hour mark			2
@entity35 rises above the @entity4 defence to direct a header towards goal at @entity100 , but he is unable to put the @entity0 ahead @entity57 has been tasked with leading the line for @entity4 after the exit of main main @entity153 to @entity154 @entity34 fires a shot past @entity51 from just inside the 18 - yard box , but he was unable to put @entity0 ahead at @entity100 @entity0 have been spirited in their fight against relegation and have n't been cut adrift at the bottom as some people feared			1
nevertheless without a win in six games , this was the type of fixture they needed to take advantage of to promote their hopes of staying up			0
@entity4 's excellent season means they are n't in any danger of being sucked into the drop zone but their home form remains better than their results on the road , as suggested by last weekend 's victory against @entity174			2
the lethargic @entity57 suddenly burst , or rather ambled into life , to test @entity9 with a low drive from 18 yards , followed by a run onto @entity56 's pass that he skied over			0
@entity4 's tactical nous made it hard for @entity0 who rarely showed the type of urgency you 'd expect with less winnable fixtures coming up against @entity185 and @entity154 next			1
whether it was the publicity from the last week , even @entity35 did n't seem to have the same dynamism and aggression as we 've seen in other games			0
@entity15 decided to do something about it by running to the edge of the pitch to kick the ball quickly back into play for a @entity0 free - kick and maybe the urgency from the manager had an effect			1
in @entity0 's next attack , @entity37 cut in from the left and hit a shot that bounced off @entity47 's chest			1
@entity37 skewed the rebound back into a crowded six - yard box where it hit @entity4 defender @entity49 on the arm			2
@entity35 and @entity4 midfielder @entity7 vie for the ball during the two side 's @entity212 match on saturday afternoon @entity15 issues instructions to his players as they desperately try to end their winless run and exit the bottom three of the @entity212 @entity34 ( right ) stretches an arm across the body of @entity51 as he tries to break through the @entity4 defence to create an opening @entity4 wide - man @entity59 ( left ) breaks past @entity37 down the right wing to fashion a chance for the away side @entity4 captain @entity50 tries to calm down @entity47 as he speaks to referee @entity225 at @entity100 @entity56 ( centre ) celebrates his side 's 1 - 0 win at @entity100 - a result which takes @entity4 above @entity230 to eighth @entity0 's players appealed loudly for a penalty but referee @entity70 ruled it was unintentional			1
it was probably the right call but you have seen them given			0
@entity35 then controlled , turned and shot in one movement but was just wide after an hour			0
as often happens in football , @entity0 then capped their best period of the match by conceding in the cruellest circumstances			0
from a corner , @entity9 made a brilliant reflex save onto the crossbar from @entity7 after @entity245 ' flick - on reached him at the far post			0
@entity7 screwed the rebound into the six - yard box where it struck the unfortunate @entity3 and diverted it past the goalkeeper whose despairing final touch was when the ball had crossed the line			2
@entity15 sent on a third striker @entity255 for winger @entity37 to try and salvage something from the game			0
and @entity47 frustrated @entity35 again with a nice dive to his right to keep out the player 's curler			0
the former @entity123 goalkeeper then produced another outstanding stop to deny @entity255 as @entity4 climbed above @entity230 into eighth place			0
@entity35 ' day lasted 87 minutes though he got sympathetic applause when he was replaced by @entity36			0
@entity4 boss @entity266 shouts at his players at @entity100 as he looks to guide his team to a second straight @entity212 win @entity37 ( right ) and @entity59 battle for the ball during a tight @entity212 match at @entity100 on saturday afternoon @entity0 fan @entity273 watches the game from the stands , but he will have left unhappy as @entity0 failed to take any points			2

@entity15 named an *unchanged* @entity0 side after they earned a point at @entity106 last time out
@entity110 was injured so @entity4 made one change , with @entity54 replacing him in midfield
@entity0 's @entity3 opened the scoring , but unfortunately in the *wrong* net - his own goal put @entity4 1 - 0 up
the @entity0 could not level the scores , leaving them without a win in seven matches and in the relegation zone
