a child was pulled out of a middle - school history class in @entity2 by his father because his class was going to discuss @entity5 ; the parent had seen a section in a @entity9 worksheet describing the @entity5 call to prayer , part of which states , ' i bear witness that there is no @entity17 but @entity18 ' in an interview with @entity35 mr @entity6 said : ' no religion should be taught at school			1
in their paper it says @entity18 is their only @entity17			2
that 's insulting to me as a @entity44 who believes in just @entity46 only			1
' @entity47 has said that mr @entity6 's son had been out of the class since he complained earlier this month , and as a result would likely receive an incomplete in his history course			1
@entity9 superintendent @entity52 told the @entity53 that the school was teaching history , not religion , and that @entity2 requires middle schools to cover such topics			0
following mr @entity6 's complaint mr @entity52 sent a letter to parents in which he described ' misinformation circulating about the teaching of religion in our middle school social studies classrooms '			2
the letter details what subjects are taught during what years - @entity71 is taught in grade 8 - and said all of the classwork was based on @entity76			0
it said : ' these documents identify the specific learning standards and concepts and skills for each grade level and each content area			0
' and goes on to say that ' no religion is taught with the purpose of converting students to that religion , insulting their own religious beliefs , or promoting the beliefs of one religion as superior to the beliefs of another '			0
mr @entity52 told the @entity53 that it would be impossible to teach history accurately without explaining the importance of religious faith			0
if schools had to ' purge all the religion out of all the history we teach , ' he said , ' we would n't be able to talk about the @entity100 or @entity101 , ... about why they were coming [ to @entity102 ] because of religious beliefs			0

@entity6 took *exception* to his son learning about @entity18
he said it was ' insulting ' to him as a @entity44 who believes in @entity46
the school said his son was now likely to get an incomplete in history
