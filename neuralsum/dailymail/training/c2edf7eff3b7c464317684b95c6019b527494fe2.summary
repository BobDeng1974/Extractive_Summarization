it was one of the most star - studded weddings of the year and since tying the knot to @entity4 in a three - day wedding extravaganza , @entity2 has secured her status as one of the world 's favourite style icons			2
the @entity14 - born lawyer 's @entity12 wedding dress quickly became one of the most coveted bridal looks - and now you can steal her style			1
esteemed designer @entity12 has created an @entity20 - inspired wedding gown , which forms part of his bridal fall 2015 collection			1
get the look : @entity12 , who designed a bespoke wedding gown for @entity2 's wedding to @entity4 has created a dress inspired by the lawyers as part of his bridal fall 2015 collection almost identical : it is n't exactly the same but the only obvious difference between this gown and the 36 - year - old 's is the length of the train			1
here @entity20 can be seen having a dress fitting with @entity12 in @entity36 it is n't the exact copy - @entity20 had a bespoke design made in his studio - but the gown has the same features , such as the same off - the - shoulder design and a similar lace overlay			1
the only obvious difference between this gown and the 36 - year - old 's is the length of the train , which may be a blessing			0
indeed , according to @entity36 , @entity20 's train consisted of so much fabric that it was too heavy for her 12 - year - old flower girl @entity49 , her sister 's daughter , to carry			1
plus , the price , which is yet to be revealed , will no doubt be lower than the original			2
@entity4 and @entity2 sold their wedding photos exclusively to @entity56 ! and people for charity			0
style icon : @entity20 , who has been advising the @entity61 government lately , said that meeting @entity62 made the design process all the more magical ' as he is so warm and such a gentleman ' fashion 's darling : from her monochrome @entity71 arrival outfit to the post-wedding @entity73 couture mini-dress , pictured , @entity20 has positioned herself as a global style icon and a picture of @entity20 's dress fitting with @entity12 was also taken by famed photographer @entity77 for @entity36			1
the acclaimed barrister told the fashion bible : ' @entity4 and i wanted a wedding that was romantic and elegant , and i ca n’t imagine anyone more able than @entity62 to capture this mood in a dress			0
' meeting him made the design process all the more magical , as he is so warm and such a gentleman			0
' back on home soil : the 36 - year - old barrister - who changed her name last week after marrying the @entity90 actor - touched down at @entity92 on thursday afternoon following a four - day work trip in @entity94 @entity20 was pictured being attended to by @entity12 and head tailor @entity95 , who helped her into the gown made of ivory tulle and appliquéd with fourteen yards of @entity99 , its bodice hand embroidered with beading and crystals			1
as her mother @entity105 and sister @entity104 watched on , it was decided the dress was so heavy that @entity104 's 12 - year - old daughter @entity49 - who was @entity20 's only flower girl - would have to be helped in her train - carrying duties by @entity104			1
the dress was so gorgeous that both @entity105 and @entity110 broke down in tears as @entity20 tried on the gown , @entity36 reports , as @entity12 told the magazine : ' it ’s the most important dress in the life of a woman			1
' any girl from any walk of life dreams of that special dress , and i try to make that dream a reality for her			0
@entity20 and i looked at a lot of evening dresses and wedding dresses together , and we discussed what she liked			2
that gave me the idea of what she wanted			0
' the pair had a quick chat about veils - @entity20 debated whether she needs a shorter veil for the reception - and @entity12 told her : ' no , i think after the wedding you take off the veil altogether ; you do n’t need it anymore			1
once you are married , you are married			0
' speaking about @entity20 's wedding wardrobe and her ascent to global style icon , fashion writer @entity144 said : ' @entity20 is surely now the first lady of @entity150 ? she has got the high - profile hubby , has her own amazing career , will now of course be enlisted to help with charities and has the most incredible designer wardrobe			2
' she has given us a glimpse of what to expect from her when dressing for occasions in the space of a few days : her monochrome @entity71 arrival outfit demonstrates her ultra chic travelling wardrobe , the stand - out red @entity159 dress was sexy eveningwear done to perfection , the post-wedding @entity73 couture mini-dress shows how she does short and sassy , and the trouser - and - top combo for their civil ceremony was her answer to chic , well - tailored classic dressing			2
' not to mention the most exquisite bespoke @entity12 wedding gown , equipped with diamantes and pearls			2
this is the kind of dress women dream about			0
it was truly a masterpiece			0
' women will want her wardrobe , and they will try and emulate her looks			0
