a spokesperson for the @entity9 said : ' the reason for the withdrawal is that the packaging does not state the product contains peanuts , which is a specific allergen that ’s listed in legislation			1

' booths said it takes the accurate labelling very seriously			0
technical manager , @entity71 , alerted the @entity9 to this error immediately as well as posting notices in all booths stores			2
‘ it is our responsibility as retailers to accurately record allergy advice , and in this instance , we felt a responsibility to recall the product and issue a notice to our customers who might suffer from a specific peanut allergy , ’ he said			2

last month , the store withdrew some of its @entity90 because it contained soya			0
