@entity0 stands as the one bonus from a now infamous deal			1
while the other members of the @entity5 have managed a paltry 44 minutes of football between them , the @entity3 has positively thrived at @entity7			1
so much so , in fact , that he admits any possibility of staying at @entity11 beyond the end of this season would be an immensely attractive option			1
whether or not that can happen will depend on a number of factors			2
@entity0 has denied a report on @entity19 stating he had already declared his intention to quit @entity21 , where he has one year left on his contract			1
summer discussions with his parent club will have to take place			2
@entity0 has thrived at @entity7 under new manager @entity26 by then , he will also know whether @entity7 have fulfilled their aim of promotion via the play - offs			1
certainly , he has done much so far to try to make @entity31 football a reality at @entity11 once again			1
@entity0 has scored six times since signing for @entity7 , including three in his last two appearances as the revival under @entity26 has gathered momentum			1
the 22 - year - old is clearly relishing the exposure he has been granted			2
having begun to stagnate on the fringes of the @entity5 squad , he feels revived by life in @entity42			1
‘ i ’m really enjoying playing my football and i ’m training hard , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ at @entity5 , i did n’t have that chance			1
‘ but it ’s nonsense that i have said i am going to quit @entity5			1
i still respect @entity5 because i have a year left there			1
and i also respect @entity7 because i have a loan deal here			1
‘ we will see what is going to happen in the transfer window and what @entity5 have to say			1
i will get options and i have to take the option that is best for me			2
’ and if @entity7 were to make an offer for his services come the end of the season ? @entity0 has won over @entity7 fans with six goals from 10 games , including this strike against @entity63 ‘ that would be a good option because i ’m really enjoying my football here , ’ replied @entity0			1
‘ i ’m scoring goals , playing well and the fans like me			2
it would be a great option for me			2
‘ this is the happiest i have been for a while with my football because i am playing every week			0
as a player , that is all you want			0
to show people that you are good			0
’ clearly , there is little appeal in returning to @entity19 simply to spend another 12 months stuck in the reserves or filling space on the bench			0
‘ that would n’t be the best option for me , ’ he admitted			0
‘ playing first - team football is very different from the under - 21s , where you basically play with the kids			0
you want to play at a bigger , stronger level			0
‘ in football you have to take a step back to go forward			0
i feel from @entity5 to @entity7 on loan i took that step back but now i want to go forward			1
‘ if i go back to play under - 21 games with @entity5 i would go even more back			1
i just have to see what happens in the summer but i want to play first - team football			0
‘ when i was 18 or 19 years old i was getting a chance in the first team at @entity5 but i broke my hand on my debut against @entity100			1
‘ i had a couple of set - backs and after spending a couple of months out you have to fight again for your place			0
i feel i could have done more in @entity5 if i had n’t had the injuries			2
’ the 22 - year - old celebrates scoring a goal for @entity5 , but could find himself leaving @entity109 @entity0 was deemed sufficiently surplus to requirements to be shipped out in a mass deal arranged when the previous board were still in place			1
current interim chairman @entity114 cited the signing of the quintet without undergoing medicals as an example of the ‘ recklessness ’ that preceded regime change			0
@entity121 will not play this season because of an unspecified ‘ medical condition ’ he admits was there before he joined @entity7			1
@entity26 is also sceptical about @entity126 ’s ability to feature , although he will finally arrive at @entity127 next week as recovers from a long - term knee injury			0
@entity129 has been training but has yet to make a first - team debut , while @entity131 did n’t quite make it to half - time against @entity134 in february before succumbing to a hamstring injury			2
it was recently revealed that @entity7 will have to pay @entity5 £ 500,000 for the privilege of the loans if they gain promotion			1
‘ they are all fighting for their place , ’ said @entity0 of his colleagues			2
‘ @entity129 is training , @entity143 is injured and we all know the problem @entity146 has got			0
‘ i spoke to @entity147 and he is coming soon , but he will have to prove himself			0
the plan is for him to feature before the end of the season			2
‘ i did n’t feel any pressure personally when i came here			0
i just wanted to do my maximum for the club and to gain experience			0
‘ since the manager came in , i have really enjoyed it			0
he knows what he is talking about			0
we all follow his gameplan and we are winning			0
he came here with a target to put us in the @entity161			0
‘ when i first came the changing room was a little bit down because of what was going on here			0
‘ now when you start winning games the players are more motivated , enthusiastic and everybody fighting			2
the quality of the training goes up straight away and you can develop even more			0

@entity0 has spent second half of season on loan at @entity7
@entity177 star has been a success at @entity11 with six goals in 10 games
@entity5 may decide to sell him with one year left on his contract
