a mother who began sprouting thick facial hair after the birth of her son 28 years ago says she 's feeling sexier and more confident than ever before , having finally stopped trying to get rid of her beard			1
the @entity6 - born woman , identified only as @entity7 , appeared on @entity9 's @entity8 to discuss why she stopped tweezing the hair on her face which she had been plucking every day for almost two decades			1
@entity7 , 49 , also explained to @entity12 and @entity13 that she is happy with the way she looks and would not change her situation , despite being criticised for her behaviour by her own mother			1
@entity7 - who has had tests to rule out serious medical problems more associated with excessive hair growth in women - told @entity13 and @entity12 , along with expert dr @entity40 , that she had never had any facial hair before the birth of her son , after which it gradually began growing			1
ten years on , the hair was growing thick enough for a full beard , and @entity7 would laboriously tweeze out each hair every morning			1
' i asked my mother what to do and she told me to tweeze them , never to shave or wax			2
and then i visited my gynaecologist who said it happened to lots of other women so i should n't worry			2
but they did n't really give me a reason			2
now i know it must be inherited ' my chin got really red and inflamed from all the plucking , and some of the hairs were ingrown , so it always looked like i 'd fallen on my chin			2
but when people asked what had happened and i told them they could n't believe it			2
' in 2008 , when she was living alone and unemployed , @entity7 decided to give her beard a chance to grow			1
she said : ' i had no job so i had free time to give it a chance and see what happened , so i started a blog to inform other women about it , and to see what was happening every day and how i felt			1
@entity7 explained to @entity12 and @entity13 that prior to her ' experiment ' plucking her beard had become an obsession , and that her son , who has not been named , used to remember it taking her hours to leave the house			1
she added : ' i thought about it all the time			0
i had to double check before leaving the house that it was ok , and take a mirror in my pocket			0
' when i decided to let it grow it did n't feel brave , it was more like a curiosity			1
i wanted to see hwat would happen to me			0
there was a big fear that everyone would turn away and nobody would talk to me anymore			0
' @entity7 , 49 , appeared alongside dr @entity40 on @entity9 's @entity8 to explain her situation to @entity12 and @entity13 and @entity7 did meet some resistance - from her family			1
' my mum said " do you have to shock people like this "			0
then she got used to it and thought that one day i 'd finish it , and was patient , but now she 's getting nervous and wants me to stop and become " normal "			1
' she received negative reactions from other people , too , especially on the internet : ' people can be cruel depending on where you go			0
' some people say people like me should be sent to @entity34 or shot , but that 's just one person on the internet writing horrible stuff			1
other people say it 's courageous and inspiring			0
so there are both sides			0
' @entity7 now travels with a circus as the bearded lady act , which she says she enjoys since she has studied acting in the past and also likes educating people about the issue			1
she said : ' i want to give people the opportunity to talk to a bearded lady , because usually they are too scared in the street			1
' @entity7 , who has been single for a decade , also says she is looking for a relationship now that she is feeling sexy and more confident			1
she told @entity12 that even if she could she would not change her situation			1
@entity12 and @entity13 asked @entity7 how she felt about having a beard ' i know myself more now , ' she said			1
' there are always people with a fetish who might only be attracted by the beard , but that is the same with lots of things , even if i were a blonde woman			2
' i tried electrolysis three times but it just grew back - and now i 'm happy with it			2
it is sometimes annoying when i go shopping but otherwise it has given me other opportunities			0
dr @entity145 explained that it is fairly common for women to have facial hair they do not want , but if it comes on suddenly - especially if accompanied by other symptoms such as weight gain and irregular periods - you should see your gp since it could be to do with excessive of androgen hormones			2
what causes excess facial hair ? it 's estimated that one in ten women suffers from excess facial and body hair			0
but what causes it ? ' sometimes race or just a family tendency to be more hairy is to blame , rather than any medical problem , ' explains dr @entity168 , an endocrinologist from @entity169 , @entity170 , with a special interest in excess hair			0
' people of @entity175 or @entity176 descent tend to have more hair than @entity178 or those with black skin , for example			0
it 's also possible to be quite a “ hairy ” family regardless of race			0
' but there are other factors that could be to blame			0
women normally produce low levels of male hormones called androgens , but an excess can trigger unwanted hair growth known as hirsutism			0
a common cause of hirsutism is @entity195 , which has accompanying symptoms of acne , weight gain and irregular periods			0
other , rarer , causes include a tumour on the ovary or adrenal gland as well as certain medicines including steroids			0
rarely , a woman will have normal androgen levels and the cause of the unwanted hair growth will not be identified .			0
