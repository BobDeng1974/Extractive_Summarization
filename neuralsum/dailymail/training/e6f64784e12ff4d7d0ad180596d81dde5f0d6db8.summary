by @entity1 reporter published : 11:09 est , 27 august 2013 updated : 22:14 est , 27 august 2013 enjoying a sandwich while hanging precariously from the branches of one of the world 's tallest trees would n't be most people 's idea of the perfect picnic			0
but for these daredevil ecologists grabbing some lunch at the top of a 350ft @entity10 or @entity10 is just a normal day at the office			1
for climbing great heights is a challenge botanist @entity17 , 45 , and his wife @entity18 face almost every day as they study some of the oldest and definitely tallest forests on earth			1
the incredible pictures were taken at @entity29 , @entity53 , @entity30 by photographer @entity54			0
@entity17 and @entity18 worked with @entity55 and a team of experts to help him create a seamless photo of a @entity10 tree from top to bottom , something which due to the sheer size of the tree , had never been done before			1
@entity55 spent two years on the project , living in @entity30 for a year while he explored the large @entity10 forests with @entity17 , @entity18 and a team of scientists in a bid to capture the tricky shot			1
he said : ' all over the world @entity30 is known for these giant trees the @entity10 and @entity10			1
the @entity10 is used for timber and around 95 per cent of these great trees have been cut down			1
awesome : botanists show the scale of these giant trees as they take a sample of a 350 - foot giant redwood tree at @entity53 living the high life : scientists in @entity81 dangle hundreds of feet above ground as they measure a fire cave in a redwood damaged by wildlife ' my colleague decided he 'd walk the length of the forest to decide what the scientific condition of these trees was			1
i was brought in to document it			0
' these trees [ are so large ] you ca n't see all of them , when you stand on the ground in front of them you just see a little bit of the bottom			2
' the photographer said he wanted the project to be a ' celebration of these great trees '			2
he said : ' i knew i had the task of creating the star photo , i had to make a photo that led and drew everyone in			0
' i had to find the tree , i had to get permission from the parks to do all this rope work in the trees and i had to get the scientists to agree to help me			2
@entity55 chose the tree he wanted to photograph but scientist @entity17 said he could not climb it because it had been ' retired '			2
ancient : the forests of @entity28 and @entity120 , such as this one at @entity53 , are the tallest in the world and among the oldest great feat : @entity123 took this image ( left ) of a 310ft tall tree , which has the most complex crown ever mapped and a biologist prepares the rigging for an image of a large fern mat ( right ) the photographer said : ' they had studied this tree for more than 20 years			1
it is the most complex tree known on earth			0
' for all of these people who love and study them , this is their favourite tree because it 's so majestic in its shape			0
' it 's not the tallest , not the biggest , it 's the second largest , but it just has character			0
' i knew what had to be done to make the tree have its shape , that 's also why there 's figures in the photograph			0
' they are people who love the tree and study it but they 're also there for scale			0
' we wanted to give a sense of what a human looks like in comparison to the tree , we wanted to create a sense of awe and the sense of scale does that			0
' photographer : @entity123 said he wanted his project on @entity10 and @entity120 to be a ' celebration of these great trees '			1

daredevil botanists @entity17 and @entity18 tasked with measuring giant redwoods and @entity28
trees can grow up to 30 storeys high so couple must eat and sleep in the canopies hundreds of feet above ground
couple worked with photographer @entity123 to create seamless picture of a @entity10 tree from top to bottom which has never been *achieved* before
