by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 05:31 est , 5 january 2014 updated : 12:32 est , 6 january 2014 we reviewed a giant head - encasing cushion in october , which had one observer genuinely wondering whether it was a dog 's bodywarmer , and now , finally , the mini version has arrived			1
the @entity11 's little sister , the @entity10 , is half the price and half the size providing a more portable device for a snooze on the move			1
it promises to provide enough sensory deprivation for some shut - eye while being small enough to fit into a handbag like a scarf - and it wo n't scare any children			2
the @entity23 is half the price and half the size providing a more portable device for a snooze the @entity28 get their name because once they 're on , you are ' buried ' away from the outside world like an ostrich burying its head in the sand			1
they are handcrafted in @entity37 from ultra-soft jersey padded out with ' smart micro balls ' which are similar to beanbag filling but much more fine			0
this means you can slump against the side of ... well , just about anywhere , and not feel the vibrations from the train , bus or plane			0
despite its size , the original @entity11 is as light as helium and the micro balls are coated in a special silicone , meaning they do n't make a beanbag-esque noise when you lean against them			1
however , as well as the embarrassment factor , there are other downsides			0
unless you 're on a plane , sofa , or in a well - ventilated area , it can get too warm			1
wrapping a mini-beanbag around your face is not ideal in a packed , sweaty train carriage			0
it is also sure to ruin your hairdo			0
the mini version is constructed of jersey and polystyrene balls like the original @entity72			2
eager to respond to customer feedback , makers @entity73 recently unveiled the mini version , which is constructed of the same jersey and polystyrene balls			2
but this time , it only wraps around your eyes and ears in a @entity84 - style headband , leaving your neck and the top of your head exposed to the elements			1
you may look as if you 're living in a virtual reality world while it 's on your head , but the @entity91 can , at least , be pulled down and worn around the neck as a scarf when you 're awake , and is much less bulky			2
napping - in style ? the @entity11 looks like a giant balaclava crossed with an old - fashioned diving helmet available from @entity97 , the @entity73 travel cushions are the brainchilren of @entity100 and @entity101 who set up their company after meeting at university in @entity105 in the 1990s			1
their aim was to create simple solutions to everyday needs			0
and where better to start than with the @entity111 's chronic lack of sleep ? ' power - napping improves productivity by 34 per cent , ' explains @entity101			0
our writer @entity115 catches up on some shut - eye while on a bus ' we spend so much time at work , in front of a screen or in transit , we thought : " why not create something that helps us disconnect and dream ? " ' all you have to do is find a place to nap , slip on the @entity129 and away you go			0
' just one month after launching @entity10 , the company boasted 1,400 orders worth almost Â £ 50,000 , going to show they 're obviously onto something			1
after all , when you 're that tired , and a pillow is this comfortable , who gives a damn what you look like ?			0

@entity11 , Â £ *65* , is a sound - *proofed* cushion that *engulfs* your head
allows snooze on the move but is embarrassing and can get too warm
light version , Â £ *33* , is much smaller and wraps around the head and eyes
