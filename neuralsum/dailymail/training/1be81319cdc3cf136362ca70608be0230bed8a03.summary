after @entity28 was convicted on friday of causing death by dangerous driving , prosecutor @entity27 said : ‘ the court may be astonished to know the @entity3 authorities had no way of knowing if a foreign national convicted of murder is in the country until that person is charged under an @entity39 law and they can do a check			2
‘ @entity41 had no idea a man such as this was living among the good people of @entity25			1
’ but judge @entity46 replied : ‘ i am not surprised			2
’ turning to the jury at @entity48 , he said : ‘ members of the jury , welcome to our world			2
’ miss @entity53 left for work on her moped in the early hours of february 15 after celebrating @entity56 with her @entity3 partner of two years , @entity57			1
the court heard that @entity53 took safety very seriously and had been wearing a white helmet and a fluorescent yellow coat			0
she was knocked into an oncoming people carrier by @entity28 , who was driving while two - and - a - half times over the limit after drinking whisky all night			1

previously , he had been sentenced to three years ’ jail for a serious theft in @entity14			1
but despite these offences , as an @entity83 national he was able to come to the @entity3 with only minimal checks			0

‘ the driver had no time to take avoiding action			0
’ although @entity28 stopped his car a short distance from the crash he then drove off after his passenger got out			0
' when we first saw each other , i suppose you could say it was love at first sight			0
' she was my life , not a day goes by without me thinking of her and missing her ' @entity108 's @entity3 partner when @entity28 was arrested , he denied he had been driving			2
police had to send officers to @entity14 to eliminate as a suspect the man he claimed was behind the wheel			1

after remanding him in custody , judge @entity46 said : ‘ i will be recommending the deportation of this man			2
’ the ‘ free movement ’ directive means it is virtually impossible to stop @entity83 citizens with criminal convictions from entering @entity3			0
the policy – which was agreed by @entity128 in 2004 – means that anyone from the @entity83 has the freedom to travel to the @entity3 without the same stringent tests applied those from other countries			0
a @entity134 spokesman said : ‘ the onus for flagging someone ’s criminal history lies with the police in their home country			0
