by @entity0 published : 05:10 est , 24 august 2012 updated : 11:01 est , 24 august 2012 a multi-millionaire best friend of @entity3 who was partying with him in @entity4 has called the girl who sold his naked pictures ' despicable '			1
@entity7 said the incident ' put a real dampener ' on their trip to @entity12 and confirmed the culprit was one of 15 bikini - clad women in a vip suite when the prince was playing ' strip billiards '			1
he added it was an abuse of the third in line to the throne 's ' hospitality ' by someone the prince and friends met in the five - star @entity26 and invited back to his room to ‘ continue the party ’			1
in photographs seen by more than 40million people around the world , the @entity3 was snapped on a mobile phone wearing nothing but a distinctive necklace giving a topless girl a ' bear - hug ' with his bottom facing the camera			1
in another photo he cups his hands to protect his modesty while his nude companion hides behind him			0
witnesses said that the prince later disappeared with his playmate			1
party - boys : @entity3 , centre , is said to have been the first to strip at the raucous party and his friends say the leaked photos put ' a real dampener ' on the @entity4 trip ' i obviously think it is really despicable that someone would accept prince @entity3 ’s hospitality and then take these pictures , ' he said			1
furious : the prince 's pal @entity7 says the girl who sold the pictures was ' despicable ' ' i know it has put a real dampener on everybody who was on that holiday			1
' mr @entity7 , 30 , who is one of @entity70 's richest young men with an estimated £ 200million fortune , said any suggestions one of @entity3 's friends sold the pictures were untrue			1
' some people have been hinting that it was one of his friends who took the pictures			1
but that is absolutely not true , ' he said			0
' none of his friends would ever do that			2
all that i know is that @entity3 ’s friends would never have taken them			1
' the pictures were published by @entity86 today , despite the @entity87 trying to block the @entity70 press from using them on privacy grounds			2
@entity7 , who is very close to the prince , is the son of @entity93 princess @entity92 and the late brigadier @entity94 — known as the @entity95 or @entity96			1
a former @entity98 officer , @entity94 made his fortune when he helped his @entity101 friend @entity100 overthrow his father in @entity103			0
meanwhile the @entity3 is claimed to have torn a strip off his son for his antics when he returned home this week			1
' he gave him a talking to and told him to lie low , ' a source told the @entity110			0
it came as a girl at the now infamous party in the @entity26 in @entity4 said prince @entity3 was the first to strip off in his hotel suite			1
apparently the playboy prince had his eye on a particular blonde girl and persuaded her to shed her clothes too during a game of ' strip billiards '			1
he later disappeared with his playmate , witnesses claimed			1
a reveller at the party also revealed that when other members of the group began to take photographs @entity3 said : ‘ i will shield you , i will protect you , i wo n’t let them see you ’ – making clear he was aware the pictures were being taken			1
the unnamed woman told @entity86 that she had personally been invited up to the room by a friend of the prince and found 25 people there , including at least 15 girls			1
games room : suites like this one at the @entity26 in @entity4 , which could be the same as @entity3 's , each have a pool table used for the infamous game of strip billiards as they stood in the billiards room with stunning views of the @entity151 at about 4am a friend said : ‘ i have an idea , let ’s spice up a game of pool			1
’ ‘ @entity3 said : “ @entity155 ”			1
that was what jump - started the party , ’ she said			2
the rules of the ' strip billiards ' game were if a player potted the ball they got to go again but if they missed they took a piece of clothing off			2
@entity3 chose a pretty , petite blonde to play with him			1
‘ she had her eyes on @entity3 so she was going to do anything , ’ the source said			2
‘ he was helping her hold the cue			0
he was very attentive and hands on , showing her how to do it			0
he only had eyes for her … she was definitely someone he met for the first time that night			0
’ @entity3 went first and was only wearing swimming shorts			2
when he missed he was forced to go naked straight away			2
‘ everyone was watching when he took his clothes off			0
it was exciting for the girls			0
he was in great shape , ’ said the partygoer			0
breathtaking : the room used by @entity3 will have had stunning views of the vegas strip , like this one @entity185 and famous : the three bedroom duplex suite costs thousands of dollars per night to rent the girl then missed her shot and took her dress off			2
she shot again , missed and was then forced to take her bra off – which is when @entity3 hugged her from behind to ‘ protect ’ her modesty			2
afterwards they put their clothes back on , @entity3 offered her a beer and they sat on a couch talking together			1
the witness told the newspaper : ‘ he had his eyes on her from the start			0
he was very into her			0
she was giddy to be in the company of the prince and he was flirting with her			0
’ crucially the witness added : ‘ no one asked for our phones or anything about us when we arrived at the party			2
it was obvious people were taking pictures			1
’ the source recalled @entity3 was excited at the prospect of meeting pop star @entity214 at a pool party the next day			1
she revealed : ‘ he loved @entity4			0
there was music , lots of noise and excitement			0
‘ he was very friendly , there was no mention of him being a prince			0
he was up for whatever was going to happen that night			0
‘ @entity3 also knew @entity214 was in town			2
he said “ i ’m going to party with @entity214 ”			0
he was back by the pool to party again five hours after we left him			0
’ the partygoer and her friends had spotted @entity3 and his group at the @entity232 in the @entity26 earlier that night			1
she recalled : ‘ we thought he looked hot			0
we wanted to get closer but could n’t as he was very well guarded			0
everyone was dancing and we became friendly with one of his friends			0
in the early hours we were invited up to the room			0
’ just a day after @entity3 was called the ' royal @entity240 ' , the mayor of @entity239 has come rushing to the defence of the beleaguered prince			1
naked pictures of the third in line to the throne have swept across the internet causing him huge embarrassment			2
but some commentators have predicted that like @entity240 , errors of judgment and bungling incidents often end up being celebrated rather than damaging			0
earlier this month mr @entity240 somehow got stuck on a zip - wire , but in a precarious situation that would have finished most politicians , @entity240 somehow managed emerge from the farce unscathed , even glorified			0
speaking today on @entity257 , mr @entity240 , pictured above with @entity258 as the @entity260 celebrations began in @entity261 today , said he viewed @entity3 's naked billiards episode with ' deafening indifference '			1
' i think it would be disgraceful if a chap was n't allowed to have a bit of fun in @entity4 , ' he said			0
' the real scandal would be if you went all the way to @entity4 and you did n't misbehave			2

one of his best friends said today that the scandal ' put a real dampener ' on their trip
multi-millionaire @entity7 says one of at least 15 bikini clad girls at the party sold the pictures seen by 40 million across the globe
fellow reveller claims the prince persuaded a blonde woman to strip when he already had his clothes off
when people starting taking pictures he said : ' i wo n’t let them see you ’ and allowed her to hide behind his naked frame
