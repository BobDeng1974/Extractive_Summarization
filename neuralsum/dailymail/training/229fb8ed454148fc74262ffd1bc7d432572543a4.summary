by @entity1 reporter published : 12:06 est , 4 january 2014 updated : 14:42 est , 4 january 2014 @entity4 campaigners have urged the government not to ' gamble ' with @entity7 's natural heritage by allowing developers to destroy the @entity10 's ancient woodland			2
environment secretary @entity11 sparked anger after defending the ' biodiversity offsetting ' scheme he plans to introduce			1
it would allow developers to compensate for the destruction of habitats by creating or enhancing other natural areas by agreeing to plant 100 trees for each one felled			0
@entity21 scene : @entity23 in @entity24			0
there are 380 ancient woodlands in the @entity10 under threat from projects including the @entity30 high - speed rail line mr @entity11 told @entity31 the policy could be applied to woods dating back more than 400 years - around a third of all woodland in @entity7			1
while destroying mature trees was a ' tragic loss ' , replacing each with 100 new ones would ' deliver a better environment over the long term ' , he said			1
@entity41 said any move to build on ancient woodland would be restricted to major projects and would only get planning permission in exceptional cases			2
mr @entity11 conceded that the present generation of @entity10 residents would lose out and that replacement sites could be up to an hour away by car			0
@entity51 : ' it 's the quality of forests that 's important , not just the quantity of trees , ' says @entity58 nature campaigner @entity57 but he insisted the initiative - designed to ease the construction of homes , roads and major projects - would result in an ' enormous increase ' in trees			1
' the point about offsetting is it will deliver a better environment over the long term , ' he told the newspaper			1
under fire : environment minister @entity71 he signalled that he would like to see offsetting become compulsory to encourage a market of sites that could be improved			1
that was one recommendation of a report by the @entity77 which also raised serious concerns			0
it said the proposed system was too simplistic to take into account the full value of the lost sites and a full assessment of pilot projects was required			2
while speeding up development was welcome , there was a risk developers were given ' carte blanche ' to concrete over valuable habitats , it concluded			0
the report specifically highlighted fears ancient woodland and @entity96 would not be adequately protected			0
@entity58 nature campaigner @entity57 said including ancient woodlands ' highlights the absurdity ' of the policy			1
' it 's the quality of forests that 's important , not just the quantity of trees			2
' ministers should be protecting nature , instead of gambling with it by allowing @entity10 's best wildlife sites to be shifted around the country			0
' the government 's mad cap biodiversity offsetting plans should get the chop - not our forests			1
' the @entity116 said more than 380 ancient woods were already under threat from projects including the @entity30 high - speed rail line			1
offsetting should only be used as a ' last resort ' , policy director @entity121 told @entity31 - criticising mr @entity11 's suggestion that an hour 's journey by car would be close enough to do compensatory work			1
beauty of @entity128 : @entity129 said ' irreplaceable ' habitats must be excluded from government policy ' it is critical that any habitats created to compensate for loss are placed within the local area that suffered the original impact , ' she said			0
' unfortunately , this still appears open to debate			0
' three years ago , mr @entity11 's predecessor @entity140 was forced by public outcry into an embarrassing u-turn on plans to sell off @entity7 's public forests			1
campaigners are now warning that they too could be under threat again in the form of plans to introduce a new management organisation to ' own and manage the @entity151 '			1
@entity41 insists there are no plans to sell or privatise @entity7 's forests following the establishment of the new arrangements			2
@entity129 said ' irreplaceable ' habitats must be excluded from the policy and said it was ' deeply concerned ' at any suggestion otherwise which appeared to go beyond previous proposals			0
conserving and protecting ancient and historic woodland is one of its charitable purposes			0
' offsetting the losses of wildlife that usually accompany development by creating replacement habitats could be a useful addition to the planning system , ' a spokesman said			0
' but it must n't mean mature irreplaceable habitats being replaced by low - quality habitats that will take decades to develop the character and complexity of those that have been lost			0
' there will be some habitats that are effectively irreplaceable and should not be part of any offsetting scheme			2

@entity71 claims government scheme would deliver a ' better environment over the long term '
' the mad cap biodiversity offsetting plans should get the chop - not our forests , ' say @entity58
