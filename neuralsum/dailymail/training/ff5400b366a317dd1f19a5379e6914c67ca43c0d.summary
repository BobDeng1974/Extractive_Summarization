@entity1 passengers lying about their health has rendered airport screening for diseases including @entity5 ineffective , with around half of infected travellers missed			2
concerns over being delayed drives passengers to withhold the full truth over their risk of exposure , experts warned today			0
a team of scientists from @entity16 and @entity17 examined screening processes for six different viruses			0
they were @entity5 , @entity21 , @entity23 respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( @entity24 ) , marburg virus , swine flu and avian flu			1
the team said questionnaires are the most effective detection method when a disease is in its early stages , and sufferers are not showing any signs of symptoms			1
a new study has found arrival screening for diseases including @entity5 , like that taking place at @entity39 , above , is more effective than departure checks , because symptoms can develop during travel scientists in @entity16 and @entity17 said infrared temperature checks , pictured above at the airport in @entity44 , @entity45 , at best , only detect fevers 70 per cent of the time but they admitted that at best , just 25 per cent of people honestly reported their exposure to flu during the 2009 swine flu pandemic , while others hid symptoms by taking medication			1
they found checking the temperatures of passengers suspected as being at risk of exposure to diseases like @entity5 and the related marburg virus is ' particularly ineffective '			1
the scientists said the long incubation periods of the two illnesses - in @entity5 the incubation period is two to 21 days , while it 's three to nine days for @entity58 - renders the policy useless			0
but , they noted , the practice does prove beneficial when trying to detect cases of other diseases including swine flu , that has a shorter incubation period			1
the study found questionnaires , such as this one from @entity71 , are most effective when diseases are in their early stages @entity74 , from the @entity75 , said : ' we found that for diseases with a long incubation period such as @entity79 and @entity5 , taking passengers â€™ temperature to test for fever is particularly ineffective at the start of an epidemic but does pick up more cases as it stabilises			1
' with diseases such as swine flu that take a shorter time to incubate , fever screening is the most effective method throughout an epidemic , ' she added			1
fever screening at arrival destinations has been criticised for being ineffective			2
but the researchers suggest it might prove more effective than those programmes that rely on screening passengers as they leave a country			0
the study notes some symptoms of diseases will progress during a journey , making it easier to detect on arrival			2
and they warn , at best , infrared non-contact thermometers will only ever detect fevers 70 per cent of the time			0
dr @entity74 , said : ' honest reporting can not only improve on - site detection but is essential to enable authorities to follow up with travellers who may have been exposed but have not yet developed symptoms			0
' we need to find ways to incentivise better self - reporting			0
' the study suggests resources could be better spent on arrival screening , or on tracing and containing potential cases that appear through airport questionnaires			2
the research carried out at the @entity75 , @entity124 ( @entity125 ) , and the @entity126 will be published in the journal @entity128 .			0

new study found arrival screening is more effective than departure checks
questionnaires most effective at detecting disease in its early stages
temperature checks ineffective for @entity5 and the related @entity140 virus
but proves effective when trying to detect cases of swine flu , experts said
just 25 *%* of people honestly told of exposure to flu during 2009 epidemic
