freed : @entity0 , 19 , has been given a suspended sentence after burgling her parents a middle - class couple who shopped their tearaway daughter to police when she burgled the family home yesterday criticised a judge for sparing her jail			1
@entity10 and @entity11 hoped 19 - year - old @entity0 would be sent to prison as a ‘ wake - up call ’ after years of stealing and poor behaviour			1
they said their family were left devastated by their daughter ’s betrayal when she raided their £ 300,000 home three times in just a few weeks , stealing jewellery , including her father ’s £ 4,000 gold watch			1
but despite her guilty plea to three counts of burglary , recorder @entity29 allowed @entity0 to walk free with a 22 - month suspended sentence			1
last night mrs @entity0 , 45 , and her company director husband , @entity32 , 46 , labelled the punishment a ‘ joke ’ and said it would not deter @entity0 from stealing again			2
‘ most people would be ashamed if they behaved this way , but not our daughter , ’ mrs @entity0 said			2
‘ she is uncaring and cold and it ’s about time she got severely punished because she needs a wake - up call			0
‘ the suspended sentence was a joke and she will see this as a reason to do it all again			1
the thieving has gone on for donkeys ’ years , and going to court was our last resort			0
we just could n’t go on			0
’ @entity0 , who is unemployed and lives off benefits , is the couple ’s fourth - born of five daughters			1
the couple said they have not had problems with any of their other children			0
one is an accountant , another is a company manager , the third eldest is studying at university to be an engineer while the youngest is still at school			0
family : @entity64 , right , wants her daughter @entity0 , second left , to be sent to prison targeted : the teenager stole possessions from her own family home , pictured , in @entity70 , @entity71 mrs @entity0 said problems began at a young age with @entity0 when the couple were asked to move her from a nursery for being badly behaved			1
she had problems throughout school and aged 14 she allegedly arranged for the family ’s @entity77 to be stolen after she was scolded by her parents for coming home drunk			1
mr and mrs @entity0 were so concerned they moved to @entity82 with the girls to make a fresh start , but @entity0 failed her gcses and her thieving sprees continued			2
at 16 , she moved back to @entity87 and began a relationship with a man 20 years older			0
she went on to have two children by him , now aged one and two			0
mrs @entity0 said the couple came back to @entity87 after being told by social services their daughter was pregnant			2
she added that they have always supported her financially , looked after her children and even paid a deposit for her flat , which she trashed			0
tearaway : the teenage mother 's parents begged for her to be jailed to protect other people despair : mrs @entity0 says , ' it 's about time she got severely punished , because she needs a wake - up call ' ‘ she will probably be as proud as punch at having her 15 minutes of fame in court , ’ mrs @entity0 said			1
‘ i bet she will even cut out any newspaper clippings and stick them on her wall			0
’ a former school governor , mrs @entity0 added : ‘ as a parent you always want the best for your kids , we do n’t push them to be something supersonic , it is more a case of being happy and getting on in life			2
‘ for us , getting the police involved was very much a last resort			0
i was hoping prison might nip it in the bud			0
’ @entity128 @entity127 was told that the burglaries began on october 5 last year when @entity0 broke into the couple ’s home , in @entity70 , @entity71 , and stole a gold and diamond bracelet			1
just over a fortnight later , @entity0 smashed a toilet window and stole 14 cartons of cigarettes , before the final burglary on november 30 when she smashed a patio door with a brick , showering her own children ’s toys with glass , before stealing mr @entity11 ’s 18 - carat gold watch			2
in police interviews @entity0 claimed she had carried out one of the raids because her mother had ignored her and given her a ‘ dirty look ’ earlier in the day			1
well - off : the family 's four other daughters have all embarked on professional careers @entity153 , defending , told the court that @entity0 was a ‘ deeply troubled and traumatised young lady ’			1
‘ she has hurt those closest to her for what she believes are perceived personal slights and a lack of support from her mother , ’ he said			0
sentencing @entity0 to 22 months ’ youth custody , suspended for two years , the judge said : ‘ your behaviour has been mean , spiteful , motivated by malice and caused an enormous amount of distress			1
' you have made judgments about your parents and you have done that for reasons which are , frankly , difficult to understand			0
‘ these were cunning , well - planned and skilfully carried out burglaries			0
' you were engaged in acts really calculated , and it seems deliberately intended to hurt and hurt it did			0
’ he also served her with a 12 - month exclusion order , banning her from going within 200 metres of her parents ’ home			2
last night @entity0 , who has been living at a shelter for homeless teenagers , in @entity184 , @entity71 , could not be contacted for comment .			1
