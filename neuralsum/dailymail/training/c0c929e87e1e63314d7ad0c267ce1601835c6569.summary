a surge in applications from migrants is fuelling the @entity5 crisis , it emerged last night			1
a record 207,989 foreigners were handed citizenship last year – a huge rise on the 82,000 seen in the year 2000			1
their requests for papers are contributing to the delays at the @entity5 , which is struggling to clear a backlog of 500,000 applications			1
last year only 3 per cent of those who asked for citizenship were rejected and two million migrants have been awarded it since 2000			1
once citizenship is granted , a first passport application usually follows – a time - consuming bureaucratic exercise that involves a face - to - face interview			1
whistleblowers say these first - time applicants are being pushed to the back of the queue as @entity5 staff try to get to grip on the crisis			1
@entity36 , of @entity37 , said : ‘ the moment you become a @entity41 citizen you can get a @entity41 passport and i suspect many of those 207,000 will have and that is certainly something that adds to the difficulties			1
’ adults who had booked face - to - face interviews in @entity49 were directed to offices elsewhere to allow staff to concentrate on fast - track renewals			0
the @entity53 claimed this measure was ‘ nothing out of the ordinary ’ but applicants described chaotic scenes inside the offices with some people in tears			2
@entity62 spent two days frantically trying to obtain a passport for her teenage daughter to go on holiday			0
‘ it is very traumatic , i have been crying a lot , ’ said the social worker			0
‘ i was very upset , but it was the only way they would understand			0
’ the holiday plans of thousands of families are in jeopardy as the @entity5 struggles to clear a backlog of 500,000 applications shadow home secretary @entity76 said : ‘ this shambles just gets worse			1
@entity78 are due to have their passport office part shut in their faces just at the time they need it most			2
‘ home secretary @entity83 has refused to say sorry for her shambles			0
she needs to get a grip , take responsibility and put this right			0
’ under new measures , @entity41 who are due to travel in the next seven days , and who submitted their application longer than three weeks ago , will be granted a fast - track passport service free			1
expats seeking to renew their passport overseas so they can get back to the @entity41 will gain an automatic 12 - month extension and parents living overseas applying for their children will be given emergency travel documents			1
one insider said some of his colleagues were becoming suicidal under the pressure of trying to clear the backlog			2
‘ @entity83 has got no idea			0
she does n’t know how bad things are , ’ he added			0
‘ we are just worn out , really worn out , and it ’s been going on for far too long			0
a woman in my team burst into tears because of the pressure			0
’ tens of thousands of applications wait to be processed at the @entity115 passport office , one of seven around the country			2
this photo was taken by an employee who said staff were being drafted in from other departments the disillusioned employee works at the @entity115 passport office where a member of staff this week leaked a photograph of thousands of applications stacked in meeting rooms waiting to be processed			2
he said staff were being drafted in from other departments without adequate training			0
critics have blamed job cuts and office closures for the problems			0
in the face of mounting fury , mrs may and other ministers had refused to acknowledge there was a crisis , attributing an ‘ unprecedented ’ surge in applications to a stronger economy			2
in the final three months of last year , 59,687 citizenship applications were approved compared with 41,121 in the same period of 2011			1
this is the group of people most likely to be seeking their first @entity41 passport .			1
