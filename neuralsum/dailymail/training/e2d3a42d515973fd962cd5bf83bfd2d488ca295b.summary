police in @entity1 have been caught on tape letting their fellow officers off the hook for speeding - because they were running late for a conference			1
a lengthy recording by a regular driving listening in on the police scanner picks up the cops spotting patrol cars roaring down a 60mph freeway at speeds as high as 86mph - then laughing it off			1
the conversation took place between ground - based officers and a @entity18 plane running a speed trap on @entity20 near @entity21 , around three hours east of @entity22			1
one patrol car was going at 86mph on @entity20 near @entity21 , @entity1 at first the airborne officer spots a white car overtaking traffic but does n't clock the speed until he works out ' whether we want it or not ' , the video			1
the footage , uploaded to @entity47 by blogger @entity25 , then records a second officer being clocked at 86mph - 26mph over the stated 60mph limit for the stretch			2
but , rather than take action , the two officers chuckle to one another and describe the car roaring down the highway as a ' pretty good one '			1
as more and more officers speed by it dawns on the two that they are all headed to a drugs conference in nearby @entity60 - which starts at midday			2
the footage was recorded around 10.30am			2
the airborne officer , nervous about the speeds , seems to suggest taking action at one point			0
' late for conference ' : the officers joke over the airways about mentioning the speeding to the officers themselves - but concede it would n't make them many friends on their way : the footage was filmed on @entity20 outside of @entity21 , @entity1 ( highlighted )			1
the cops were on their was to @entity60 ( top right of the map ) he tells his colleague : ' i do n't know if it matters or not but all the ones i 'm not calling the speeds at have been over 80			0
' but the response bats away the prospect of issuing any tickets - as would happen to normal motorists - and said that the issue could result in ' a little announcement to slow down next time ' at the conference			0
even though later in the video one motorcyclist 's behavior is described as ' unsafe ' when he overtakes somebody at 72mph , the officers seem more concerned the prospect of being unpopular than taking any action			2
when it is suggested that officer in the plane fly to the conference and confront the speeding officers , he jokes : ' i 'm sure i 'd make lots of friends			1
' the @entity18 has admitted the video , dated october 8 , is legitimate			0
after the double - standard emerged , the department also said it would void any tickets issued to motorists over the two - day period of the conference , @entity106 reported			0
spokesman @entity112 said : ' typically we do n't stop what we know to be a police vehicle because they could be on their way to an emergency that we do n't know about '			0
the @entity120 radio station reported that he said : ' we learned about the video and we understand how it would make people fee			0
if they 're not going to an emergency they should obey that the rest of us obey			0
