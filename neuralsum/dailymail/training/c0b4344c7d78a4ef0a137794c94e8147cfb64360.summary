clearly these are ministers who have put their money where their mouth is and are very serious about making sure every penny of taxpayers ' money is spent effectively			2
' the chancellor warned ministers resisting cuts of up to 10 per cent that he would not go back to the benefits budget to raise money @entity2 has reached agreement with seven of 24 departments on making savings of up to 10 per cent for 2015 - 16			1
but they are relatively small in comparison to the big spending ministries like business ( £ 13.8billion ) , education ( £ 53.8billion ) and defence ( £ 24.5billion ) ( all figures are budget totals for 2014 - 15 ) however , mr @entity2 has made clear to other ministers yet to settle cuts will that he will not be diverted by calls for more benefits cuts			1
the benefits cap , announced last year limiting increases in working age benefits to one per cent , is already due to raise £ 3.4billion in 2015 - 16			1
mr @entity2 said : ' we are cutting welfare and we ’re cutting welfare for the future as well			0
‘ we ’re going to make sure that no family that stays at home on benefits gets more than the average family going out to work and we ’re also making sure that welfare bills do n’t go up faster than wages , so there are big savings in welfare			2
‘ but i would also say that ’s not an excuse to let @entity98 off the hook			0
‘ we ’ve also got to make savings there so we can fix our economy , bring that deficit down and spend on the things people want us to spend on like the @entity105 , like the infrastructure that ’s going to create jobs in the future			0
’ several @entity5 ministers have called for deeper cuts to benefits to help balance the books			1
the under - 25s would be barred from receiving housing benefit and families would only receive state help for their first two children under plans outlined by @entity119 last year , but rejected by the @entity120			1
@entity122 's party has argued any further benefits cuts have to start with targeting handouts like the winter fuel allowance and free tv licence for very wealthy pensioners			2
business secretary @entity128 made clear that @entity120 will resist further welfare cuts targeted at the poor , telling @entity131 : ' simply taking more off people at the bottom end of the scale is not the right way to proceed			2
' the @entity120 have said if we are going to look at entitlements , it 's got to be people at the top that we start with			0
' deal : justice secretary @entity46 and @entity142 secretary @entity141 are among seven ministers to agree cuts of up to 10 per cent to their budgets work and pensions secretary @entity146 today denied claims he had offered more benefits cuts to spare the armed forces and police			1
counter-terror budgets could be protected from cuts in the wake of the brutal killing of drummer @entity155 in @entity156 last week			2
chancellor @entity2 vowed he would not do anything to endanger @entity159 's security at home or abroad			2
the @entity161 and the @entity162 are among departments told to find up to 10 per cent savings			1
mr @entity2 was asked whether he could protect the budget for counter-terrorism			0
he told @entity168 's breakfast : ‘ we 've been able to protect it in the past and i 'm not going to do anything which is going to endanger the security of this country at home or abroad or the fight against terrorism , but that does n't mean that you ca n't take a vast institution like the @entity162 and look for savings			1
’ @entity119 's official spokesman told reporters the prime minister agreed with mr @entity2 's comments , but declined to confirm whether this amounted to a guarantee that the anti-terror budget would escape the axe			0
the @entity189 today reported that mr @entity146 has personally contacted the @entity190 and @entity191 with an offer to cut the welfare bill by another £ 3 billion each year to protect spending on the armed forces and police			1
but a spokeswoman for mr @entity146 said : ' @entity146 has not had any special discussions about protecting the defence or security budgets			2
these measures were on the table at the time of the @entity204			0
' next month mr @entity2 will set out departmental budgets for 2015 - 16 , the financial year which spans the general election due in may 2015			1
under the spending review mr @entity2 needs to find £ 11.5billion in savings for 2015 - 16			1
at the @entity210 he announced £ 1.5billion had already been found			2
today he revealed he has now found £ 1billion from the first seven departments to agree their share of the cuts			1
they include the @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 , the @entity219 , the @entity50 and the @entity220			2
however , it does not include big spending ministries like the @entity162 or @entity161			1
in the wake of the brutal killing of drummer @entity155 in @entity156 last week , the police , armed forces and security services have stepped up their opposition to further cuts			2
defence secretary @entity32 argued in march that there was a ‘ body of opinion within cabinet who believes that we have to look at the welfare budget again ’			0
however , mr @entity2 ruled it out while insisting national security will be protected			0
‘ the key thing is to make sure we maintain our ability to defend ourselves at home and abroad , and of course that 's an absolute priority for us			0
‘ that does n't mean you ca n't find savings in the way these big departments operate , including the @entity161			2
’ risk : environment ministers have warned the @entity50 that extra cuts could leave flood defences vulnerable resistance : environment secretary @entity33 has warned more cuts to his budget could threaten flood defences while defence secretary @entity32 called for more welfare cuts to protect the armed forces a defence source said mr @entity32 had agreed ' further genuine efficiency savings can be achieved ' in his ministry and work was continuing with the @entity50 and @entity220			1
' this follows a decision by the prime minister , a few months ago , that the cabinet secretary should lead a review into what further efficiencies could be made at the @entity161 without affecting frontline capability , ' the source added			0
@entity273 today rejected the idea of the wholesale sell - off of the courts service			0
one money - saving option being drawn up for justice secretary @entity46 would involve the privatisation of courts in @entity280 and @entity281			2
court buildings and staff would be transferred into the private sector , with the potential to save £ 1billion - a - year , the @entity282 reported			1
but @entity119 's officials spokesman insisted the focus was finding savings was on cutting ' back office ' costs			0
' there are n't proposals for the wholesale privatisation of the courts service , ' he added			0
' we have been very clear that any future changes must maintain the provision of justice as a core responsibility of the state			0
' ' that piece of work is expected to finish soon			0
once this review is complete , @entity161 will be in a position to make a @entity308 submission to the @entity50			0
' the @entity215 , which has a budget of £ 6.8billion for 2014 - 15 , is the biggest to agree cuts of 10 per cent for the following year			1
but mr @entity2 insisted the 10 per cent savings announced today did not include courts privatisation			0
he told the @entity168 's today programme : ‘ these plans do not involve the privatisation of the criminal justice system			0
‘ they do propose things like making sure we use much less paper			0
i discovered as part of this process the @entity323 prints one million pieces of paper every day			0
in an age of the internet and emails , that surely is n't necessary			0
‘ but we are also making reforms to youth justice to make sure we can hold youngsters in detention without the very substantial costs at the moment			0
’ @entity335 , director of the respected @entity336 think tank , warned more cuts lie ahead for mr @entity2			0
‘ the bad news for him and , actually , for whoever wins the next election is he ’s got a whole bunch of additional spending cuts pencilled in for the years after 2015 - 16 which is the only year that this @entity308 is looking at			1
‘ it ’s looking at it now because departments are going to need some sense of how much they ’re going to have to spend in 2015 and , of course , that financial year starts just before the next election			1
’ he warned that unprotected departments like the @entity162 and @entity353 will have been hit by cuts of around 30 per cent over six years while areas like health and pensions have survived unscathed			1
@entity359 's shadow financial secretary @entity358 said : ' this is a spending review @entity119 and @entity2 never wanted or expected to happen			0
' they said their plan would balance the books by the next election , but their failure on growth and jobs means the deficit is now set to be over £ 90 billion in 2015			1
that 's why the chancellor is now asking for even more spending cuts , with most big departments yet to reach agreement			1

seven of 24 departments agree new round of cuts for 2015 - 16
chancellor has found £ *2.5bn* of £ 11.5billion for year after the next election
justice , energy , communities and @entity216 among early deals
