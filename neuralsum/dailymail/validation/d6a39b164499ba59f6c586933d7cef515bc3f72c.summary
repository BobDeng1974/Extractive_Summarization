@entity0 has predicted ' an arm - wrestle for 80 minutes ' when @entity2 heavyweights @entity2 and @entity3 slug it out at the @entity4 on saturday			1
@entity2 assistant coach @entity0 has stressed the winner - takes - all nature of a game that sees both teams featuring prominently at the tournament 's business end			2
@entity3 are two victories away from a first @entity2 @entity12 since 2009 , while @entity2 must triumph on saturday to remain in the mix for silverware			1
@entity15 ( right ) will lead his country for a record 34th time when he takes the field against @entity3 @entity2 coach @entity19 ( centre ) leads his players onto the pitch at the @entity4 @entity2 will look to @entity23 inside centre @entity24 to get them over the gainline against @entity3 @entity15 ( centre ) leads the warm - up as @entity19 's side complete their final preparations in @entity32 ' it 's going to be an arm - wrestle for 80 minutes , and that is what we 've prepared for , ' @entity0 said			1
' everything that goes on off the field pales into insignificance , and it 's all about what happens on the day			0
' they play a big pressure game , and if we can react positively to that and stay in the fight , that will give us a good chance of winning			2
' there is a lot of stake			0
@entity3 are on course for a @entity12 , and just to get away from @entity32 with a win , that 's all they will be looking to do			1
with regards to playing any attractive rugby , that will come second			0
' that 's the nature of the game at the moment , and that 's how teams are wearing each other down , and unfortunately , the spectators have got to pay a price for that			2
' @entity15 is in high spirits during the captain 's run as his side prepare for visit of @entity72 's side @entity3 have conceded just one try in three @entity2 games this season and an average of only nine points per time across eight @entity2 matches @entity72 has overseen during his coaching reign			1
@entity3 are also on a 10 - test unbeaten run - @entity79 were the last team to defeat them 13 months ago - and @entity0 added : ' they are on a a bit of a roll at the moment			1
ten wins on the bounce speaks volumes			0
' this is quite a formidable @entity3 team , and we are going to have to be at our best to come close to them tomorrow			0
@entity91 will be looking to avenge their 26 - 3 loss to @entity3 in @entity93 last season ' you have got arguably two of the better teams in the @entity2 , not being disrespectful to anybody else			2
on our day , i think both teams are capable of beating anybody			0
' with regards to motivation , we look at our own situation , and we know a win would give us an opportunity to go for the championship			0
' it is a double - edged sword that one			0
by doing that , we beat @entity3 and stop them getting a @entity12 , but it 's all about what we can achieve and gain , as opposed to anything else			1
