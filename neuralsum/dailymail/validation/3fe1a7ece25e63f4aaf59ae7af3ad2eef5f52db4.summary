much of the start of the world 's most famous sled dog race is covered in barren gravel , forcing @entity5 organizers to move the start further north where there is snow and ice			1
a weather pattern that buried the eastern @entity11 in snow has left @entity12 fairly warm and relatively snow - free this winter , especially south of the @entity13			1
' if i have one more person say to me to move the @entity5 to @entity16 , i 'm going to shake my head , ' said race director @entity18			1
but the official start two days later has been moved 225 miles ( 360 kilometers ) north , over the @entity13 , to @entity29 to avoid the area that left many mushers bruised and bloodied last year			1
@entity5 officials said the conditions are worse this year			1
the race 's chief executive officer , @entity34 , called the conditions ' pretty miserable			2
' and last year was no picnic			2
one musher last year was taken out by a rescue helicopter after making it through the @entity41 only to hit his head on a tree stump in the @entity44			2
knocked unconscious for at least an hour , @entity45 got back on the trail after waking up			0
but shortly after , he broke his ankle while walking on ice trying to corral a loose dog			0
mush ! : @entity52 's team runs across @entity53 during the @entity5 in @entity53 , @entity12 last year when the terrain was snowy enough ' as an outdoorsman , to have to be rescued from the trail is n't a wonderful thing , ' @entity45 said			1
this year 's race will feature 78 mushers , including six former champions and 20 rookies			1
the winner is expected in @entity63 in about 10 days			0
alaskans can thank the jet stream , which has been delivering warm air from the @entity67 , said @entity68 , a meteorologist with the @entity69 in @entity26			0
' that position of the jet has been pretty stagnant , or at least in the general same position for a long period of time			0
while that 's allowing a lot of cold air to flow out of the @entity78 into the @entity79 and the eastern seaboard , we 're locked into the warmer part of that pattern , and we 've continued to see those warm pushes for a fairly long period over the winter , ' he said			1
@entity26 gets about 60 inches ( 150 centimeters ) of snow in a normal year ; this year only about 20 inches ( 50 centimeters ) have fallen			2
the new route , which puts mushers on river ice for about 600 miles , could level the playing field			0
there are bare patches of grass and mud on sled dog trails in @entity26 , @entity12 making it not ideal to hold the world famous dog sled race ' nobody has a plan , ' @entity18 said			1
' you 're not going to be stopping and putting your snow hook into the same tree you had the last 20 years			2
it 's a whole new ballgame			0
' @entity106 of @entity107 , @entity12 , is running his third @entity5 , and is coming off a win in last month 's 1,000 - mile ( 1,600 - kilometer ) @entity109			1
' it does n't hurt a guy like me who has only run the race a couple of times , ' he said of the route change			0
' for the guys that have run the race 20 times , it 's not just the normal routine so it might throw them off a little bit			2
' among the veterans in this year 's race is the defending champion , @entity127 , and the 2014 bizarre finish will be remembered as much as the poor trail conditions			1
@entity34 , the chief executive officer of the @entity5 , is silhouetted as video of a musher wiping out in the 2014 race plays behind him during a meeting in @entity26 , @entity12 , ahead of the 2015 race a sudden blizzard blew four - time champion and race leader @entity137 out of the race when he was about 25 miles ( 40 kilometers ) from the finish line of the nearly 1,000 - mile race			1
then @entity52 , who was solidly in second place , waited out the storm at the last checkpoint , 22 miles ( 35 kilometers ) from @entity63 , for two hours , 38 minutes			0
she got back on the trail when @entity127 blew through the checkpoint , but lost the race by two minutes , 22 seconds			0
it was her third straight runner - up finish with no wins			0
the route change eliminates the mountainous terrain and treacherous gorge , but it could present mushers with a whole new set of problems with a flat trail on unpredictable river ice			0
plus , because it 's an entirely new route , mushers say they ca n't rely much on information , even something as simple as the mileage between village checkpoints , provided by @entity5 officials			1
by removing the @entity13 , mushers may assume it will be a very fast race , @entity127 said			2
' just because it 's a flat trail does not mean your dogs can all of a sudden do 10 times what they 've been able to do in the past , ' said @entity127 , a two - time champion			2
' i feel that is a trap that will catch a lot of people			0
' ' in the end , this race will not be won on tricks or gimmicks			0
it will be won on good dogmanship , ' he said			0
