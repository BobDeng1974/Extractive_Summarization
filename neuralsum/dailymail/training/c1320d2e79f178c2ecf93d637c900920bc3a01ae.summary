benefit claimants are being asked only to make ‘ some of the same choices working families have to make every day ’ , @entity1 insisted yesterday			1
accusing his critics of talking ‘ ill - informed rubbish ’ , the chancellor said most voters understood the need to change a welfare system that @entity10 allowed to spiral so far out of control it cost one pound in every six paid in tax by workers			1
he said the government ’s reforms , including a cap to ensure no one on benefits can get more than the average working family , were restoring ‘ common sense and control ’			1
but he insisted : ‘ these are the realities of life for working people			1
they should be the reality for everyone else too			0
i ’m proud of what we ’re doing			0
’ speaking at a supermarket distribution centre in @entity31 , the chancellor warned those opposing the government ’s reforms they were ‘ out of touch ’ with ordinary families whose taxes paid for the benefits system			1
in 2010 , when @entity10 left power , payments to working age families cost a staggering £ 90billion , the chancellor said			1
mr @entity1 suggested his approach to welfare cuts was inspired by the @entity29 slogan mug 's game : the chancellor drank tea with staff at the site , as he argued that capping benefits was fair for those who worked and paid taxes ‘ that means about one in every six pounds of tax working people like you pay was going on working age benefits			1
to put that into perspective – that ’s more than we spend on our schools , ’ he added			0
‘ for too long , we ’ve had a system where people who did the right thing – who get up in the morning and work hard – felt penalised for it , while people who did the wrong thing got rewarded for it			1
’ @entity1 's hopes of avoiding an unprecedented triple dip recession are on a knife - edge			1
the @entity94 @entity93 yesterday predicted that the economy grew from january to march , averting the devastating second consecutive quarter of decline would have officially returned the @entity94 to recession			0
export deliveries and orders from the services sector - which accounts for more than three quarters of @entity94 economic output - rose close to the all - time highs seen in 1994 during the first three months of 2013 , the @entity99 said			0
@entity106 , director general of the @entity99 , said : ' we should not be satisfied with a long and tortuous road to recovery			0
these results provide a glimpse of the as - yet - distant sunlit uplands of recovery - businesses up and down the country are working hard to drive the economy , create jobs and export , but they can not accelerate this process alone			0
' however , fears of a triple dip recession were fuelled by new figures which suggested @entity94 's manufacturing sector contracted in the first quarter following another month of sliding output			0
the sector 's ' winter of discontent ' continued into march as overall activity slumped for the second month in a row , with a worse - than - expected headline reading of 48.3 - below the 50 level which separates growth from contraction , the latest @entity123 ( @entity124 ) revealed			0
the chancellor was scathing about the ‘ vested interests ’ who complained with ‘ depressingly predictable outrage ’ about every change			1
‘ in recent days we have heard a lot of , frankly , ill - informed rubbish about these welfare reforms , ’ he said in response to criticism from @entity10 , charities and some church leaders			1
‘ some have said it ’s the end of the welfare state			2
that is shrill , headline - seeking nonsense			0
i will tell you what is true			0
taxpayers do n’t think the welfare state works properly any more			2
’ mr @entity1 said the government had to act to reform a system that was ‘ fundamentally broken ’ , leaving people better off on the dole than if they went out to work			1
‘ defending benefits that trap people in poverty and penalise work is defending the indefensible , ’ he said			2
a raft of changes comes into force this month , including a £ 500 - a - week cap on household benefits and an average £ 14 - a - week cut in housing benefit for council tenants who insist on a spare room			0
the first trials will be held of a universal credit , which replaces the main out - of - work benefits and is designed to ensure it always pays to take a job or work more hours			0
for @entity10 , shadow chancellor @entity179 insisted : ‘ the benefits bill is rising under this government because our economy is flatlining , inflation is rising and unemployment is high			2
‘ the best way to get the benefits bill down is to get our economy growing strongly and get people back to work			2
’ @entity189 , head of the children ’s charity @entity190 , appealed to ministers to ditch a 1 per cent cap on benefit increases , which is well below the rate of inflation			2
disability living allowance is being replaced by a personal independence payment			0
mr @entity1 said that for too long people who work were penalised to fund handouts for the jobless before delivering his speech on benefit changes , mr @entity1 unveiled a plague to officially open new @entity207 watchdog , the @entity208 ( @entity208 ) , as the @entity209 @entity210 , second left , and @entity211 , left , the chief executive of the @entity208 , look on			1

@entity1 says his reforms are backing ' people who want to get on in life '
he said ' vested interests always complain ' about welfare shake ups
*14million* households will be better off , the chancellor *announces*
defends cutting the *50p* top rate of tax for highest *earners*
