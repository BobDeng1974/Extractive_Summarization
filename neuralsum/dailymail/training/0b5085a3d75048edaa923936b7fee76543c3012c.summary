locked in by @entity0 and @entity1 ‘ do n't do it ! i ’m begging you			1
please , do n’t kill me ! ’ inside his head , @entity0 screamed the words			1
but no sound came from his mouth			2
after a major stroke , the 60 - year - old former policeman - turned - teacher was in intensive care , paralysed , unable to move a single part of his body			1
to the outside world , he appeared dead , hence the conversation going on between his wife , @entity18 , and the doctor			1
‘ @entity21 has been here for two days , and shown no sign of improvement , ’ said the doctor			2
‘ he has less than a 2 per cent chance of surviving two days			0
’ he explained how @entity0 ’s body had shut down — his internal organs operational only with the aid of machines , his brain all but switched off , as it had been starved of oxygen			1
@entity0 is lucky to be alive after a stroke left him paralysed and able to communicate only by blinking as @entity0 lay there , he was cruelly aware of a discussion he and @entity18 had had some months earlier			1
if either was ever in the state the doctor had just described , the other would agree to life support being terminated			1
there was a tense few minutes while @entity18 considered			1
finally , she said she ’d like to consult @entity21 ’s three grown - up daughters			1
she ’d tell the doctor tomorrow			0
through the longest night of his life , @entity21 imagined the arguments that would decide his fate batting back and forth at home			1
earlier , he ’d come as close as anyone can to being at his own funeral , as family members trooped in to say farewell			0
his best friend @entity50 had made a 750 - mile journey , touching @entity21 gently and saying : ‘ goodbye , old friend			1
’ but the funeral never happened			0
waking after the stroke , @entity21 was relieved to hear the rise and fall of his breath			1
he decided to test it by holding his breath , and found the rhythm of his breathing continued — a machine was doing it for him			0
he tried to turn his head , but his neck was unresponsive ; likewise , his arms , his legs and eyelids			0
yet he could hear everything that was going on around him			0
90 % of those with locked - in syndrome die within four months remarkably , the first improvement came during that night , as he lay with the tv on			1
eventually , the bright lights on the screen began to hurt his eyes			0
his eyelids had been opening and closing involuntarily			0
but this was the first time he had controlled the movement			0
he just needed to be able to do it when someone was watching , in order to save his life			2
next day , @entity18 told the doctors the family was n’t ready to pull the plug			1
then , one of the doctors began staring at @entity21			2
he ’d seen him blink			0
a neurologist was summoned , who said : ‘ @entity21 , if you can hear me , blink for “ yes ”			0
@entity21 was told he had locked - in syndrome			2
if he stayed alive , his condition would be all but unbearable			0
but the blinking proved the first of many small steps towards recovery , and enabled him to communicate via blinking at letters on a white board			1
he was given intensive physiotherapy on his legs and arms to prevent his muscles atrophying , and restore muscle memory			2
when he moved his tongue , the staff started him on speech therapy			0
after three - and - a - half months , he was able to mumble : ‘ thanks			2
’ seven months after his stroke , he had almost fully recovered			2
three years later , he ’s visiting the gym and cycling everywhere			0
locked @entity110 is @entity21 ’s story of what this terrifying condition is actually like , and how he survived .			0

after a major stroke , the 60 - year - old former policeman - turned - teacher was in intensive care , unable to move a single part of his body
his wife @entity18 and their three daughters had almost given up hope that he would make a recovery
doctors were ready to switch off his life support when @entity0 was finally able to communicate through blinking
