by @entity0 last updated at 5:21 pm on 30th november 2011 @entity1 has been the hit shoot ' em up of 2011 - selling eight million copies with its hyper - realistic depictions of modern urban warfare			0
but its depictions of assaults with @entity9 armoured vehicles have not been a hit everywhere			0
in @entity12 , the game has been banned as ' propaganda ' , according to reports in an @entity16 computer magazine - and young @entity16 are also protesting against it online			1
the game depicts @entity19 with authentic weaponry fighting in @entity22 countries - but the level in @entity12 's @entity24 has caused fury the ' @entity24 ' level that has caused controversy : the bazaar is a historical market in the centre of the country 's capital the ' ban ' - enforced by reported raids on computer shops - is due largely to a level called ' @entity24 ' , which is set in a clearly recognisable area of the @entity16 capital			1
the game 's release comes at a time when tensions between the two countries are high - and @entity16 are angry that one of the world 's largest game companies would use real - world locations			1
rival @entity48 is careful to have villains who are rogue @entity51 extremists - after earlier versions set in @entity22 countries			0
the @entity54 publication reported a security source as saying , ' all computer stores are prohibited from selling this illegal game			2
' the ( real ) @entity24 in @entity12 : the bazaar is a historical landmark still in use as a market today the game uses real @entity9 vehicles and weaponry - and the scenario sails a little too close to political reality for both the regime and young @entity16 an online petition has also drawn a reported 5,000 signatures , saying , ' we understand that the story of a videogame is hypothetical but we believe the game is purposely released at a time when the @entity9 is pushing the international community into fearing @entity16			1
' there have also been unconfirmed reports that shops selling the game have been raided			2
the ban is unlikely to bother makers @entity80 unduly - the game has not been officially released in the territory , and thus all copies sold are liable to be pirated			2
the @entity24 level shows a small team of @entity9 special forces infiltrating real locations in @entity16 the game - often played online in teams - features squads of @entity19 fighting in cities including @entity92 as well as @entity12			1
the ' @entity24 ' level is the one that has caused controversy , though - with @entity9 forces fighting hostile militia in a clearly recognisable @entity12 , including the city 's @entity24			1
@entity9 games set in the @entity22 and beyond are nothing new , of course - many titles have been set in @entity101 or unnamed @entity103 countries			0
the @entity9 military also releases its own videogame - @entity105 - which is designed as both a recruiting tool and a training tool for soldiers			0
the game is available free online , and again features @entity22 locations as some of its battlegrounds .			0

5,000 signature petition protests game set in @entity12
reports of raids on computer shops
protest at ' @entity24 ' level set in real landmark
@entity16 say its ' purposely released ' to stoke tensions
