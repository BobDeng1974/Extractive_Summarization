they endured ‘ three weeks of hell ’ , petrified that their first child would be taken away			0
hellish : @entity8 said she and partner @entity9 went through ' three weeks of hell ' when they were accused of hurting newborn @entity10 blemish : a health visitor found the unexplained mark on baby @entity10 's foot and called social services their torment eventually ended when a dermatologist ruled the reddish mark was not a bruise			1
while the investigations went on , the couple were not allowed to be alone with @entity10 and they moved in with mr @entity9 ’s parents to keep her in their care			1
their ordeal began when a health visitor noticed the blemish during a regular check - up			1
she was convinced it was a bruise , which a baby so young could not have caused herself , and police , doctors and social services were drafted in			1
within hours , the couple , of @entity44 , @entity45 , were under scrutiny at a hospital as paediatricians and a dermatologist examined @entity10			0
mystery : the worried parents had explained to doctors that the unexplained mark on @entity10 's foot would disappear and reappear they could not rule out a birthmark , so miss @entity8 , a legal secretary , and mr @entity9 had to bring her back two days later			1
but a dermatologist was not available then and , as the mark had faded , it was judged to be a bruise			0
@entity10 had to undergo numerous tests , scans and x-rays as her parents desperately insisted that the mark kept appearing and fading			2
they even provided photo evidence but were told @entity10 was subject to a @entity68 , meaning social services believed she was at serious risk of harm			1
but , while staying with mr @entity9 ’s parents , the family did not hear from social services for nine days			1
it was not until a social worker visited on december 31 that the mark was seen appearing and disappearing , proving it was not a bruise			0
safe and sound : ten minutes after a dermatologist confirmed that @entity10 had not been injured the case against her worried parents was closed under suspicion : ms @entity8 and mr @entity9 were told that they could only keep @entity10 with them if they stayed with his parents a week later , an examination by a dermatologist finally confirmed this			1
less than ten minutes later , the couple were told the case was closed and they could take @entity10 home			0
however , they said , there was no apology or explanation and they have lodged a formal complaint at the way @entity10 ’s case was handled			0
the couple also want to know why she was not checked for so long if she was deemed to be at serious risk			0
‘ we endured three weeks of hell when we should have been happily bonding with our baby , ’ said miss @entity8			2
‘ had they listened to us and looked at the photos i had taken of @entity10 ’s foot , this could have all been cleared up within two days			2
‘ instead our first few weeks with @entity10 were ruined as we were petrified we might lose her			0
we ’ll never get that time back			0
‘ we could n’t go anywhere without @entity9 ’s parents and even my parents had to be police checked before we could go to their house for a visit ’ @entity10 will have a dermatology appointment to determine what the mark is			1
a @entity45 council spokesman declined to comment on individual cases but said it ‘ follows a standard procedure based on national guidelines ’			0
petrified : @entity8 said she would never get the time back which she had spent worried that she would lose @entity10			2
