the parents of the man accused of murdering 12 people in a gun rampage at a movie theater have said their son does not deserve to be killed for his crimes			1
@entity7 and @entity8 , whose son @entity9 is to face trial for a brutal 2012 shooting in @entity12 , @entity13 , also denied their son is a ' monster ' on the grounds that he is mentally ill. they argued @entity8 , who is also accused of injuring 70 people in the massacre at a screening of @entity21 film @entity20 , should be allowed to plead guilty by reason of insanity and begin a life of treatment , rather than go on trial			1
the couple is pictured above @entity30 ' not a monster ' : @entity8 , pictured in court in june 2013 , ought to be institutionalized instead of killed , his parents said prosecutors are adamant @entity8 should face the death penalty in front of an open court , which is due to select its jurors next month			1
media have been given permission to televise the trial - which @entity8 's parents argued could prove traumatic in a letter to the @entity45			1
while they acknowledged that many of those affected ' would like to see our son killed ' , they said lifelong treatment would be ' best ' for him			1
' he is not a monster			1
he is a human being gripped by a severe mental illness , ' they wrote			1
@entity8 has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to charges of killing 12 people and injuring 70 in the 2012 attack at a movie theater in @entity12 outside @entity64			1
jury selection is scheduled to start january 20			0
his parents , who live in @entity67 , @entity68 , say they also would like to avoid a traumatic trial			0
one option would be a plea deal allowing him to plead guilty to the charges in exchange for life in prison without parole			0
' if that happened , our son would be in prison the rest of his life , but no one would have to relive those horrible events at a trial the media has permission to televise , ' they wrote			1
they say the best option for their son would be if he is sent to an institution for the mentally ill , which could happen if he is found not guilty by reason of insanity			1
@entity8 ' parents say they have spent every moment of the two years since the shooting thinking about the victims and their families and friends			1
' we are always praying for everyone in @entity12			0
we wish that july 20 , 2012 never happened , ' they wrote			0
the letter is the first public comment by @entity8 ' parents about the shooting since some brief comments made through a lawyer immediately after the attack in which they also expressed support for him			1
they have not disclosed details of their son 's condition or whether they had any warning that he might become violent			2
as the parents of @entity8 , we have spent every moment for more than two years thinking about those who were injured , and the families and friends of the deceased who were killed , in the theater shooting in @entity12			1
we are always praying for everyone in @entity12			0
we wish that july 20 , 2012 , never happened			0
our son pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to the charges associated with these shootings			2
defense attorneys for our son first stated in open court in may 2013 that @entity9 was diagnosed in @entity13 with a serious mental illness			1
prior to july 20 , 2012 , he never harmed anyone and he had no criminal history			0
we understand that if our son is found not guilty by reason of insanity , he could go to an institution that provides treatment for the mentally ill for the remainder of his life			2
this result would prevent any future harm to him and others			0
we realize treatment in an institution would be best for our son			2
we love our son , we have always loved him , and we do not want him to be executed			2
we also decry the need for a trial			0
a lengthy trial requires everyone to relive those horrible moments in time , causing additional trauma			0
in the criminal justice system , the prosecution and defense can agree to a sentence of life in prison , without parole , in exchange for a guilty plea			0
if that happened , our son would be in prison the rest of his life , but no one would have to relive those horrible events at a trial the media has permission to televise			2
we do not know how many victims of the theater shooting would like to see our son killed			2
but we are aware of people 's sentiments			2
we have read postings on the internet that have likened him to a monster			2
he is not a monster			0
he is a human being gripped by a severe mental illness			1
we believe that the death penalty is morally wrong , especially when the condemned is mentally ill. we are not alone in our sentiments			0
the @entity180 , an international organization of family members of murder victims and family members of the executed , and the @entity185 formed the ' prevention , @entity186 , ' aimed at ending the death penalty for people with severe mental illness			1
our family has not given interviews to the media because we do not want coverage of ourselves			0
we mourn the deaths and the serious injuries and emotional trauma of the others who were in the theater			0
the focus should be on the injured and their healing			0
