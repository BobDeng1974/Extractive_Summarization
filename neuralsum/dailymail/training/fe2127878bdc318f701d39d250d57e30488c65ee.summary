it is a common topic around the festive dinner table - memories of perfect white christmases of the past			1
however , @entity5 forecasters have revealed that in fact , they are actually far more common in recent years			2
the map they created reveals that only in a few areas ( marked in brown ) actually had more white christmases in the past			1
the map shows the percent change in snow - covered days over the week of @entity14 between 1990 to 2013 and 1966 to 1989			1
the colour blue indicates areas where the ground was more frequently snow - covered in recent years			2
@entity18 indicates areas where @entity11 in longer - ago decades were indeed whiter			2
the map below shows the percent change in snow - covered days over the week of @entity14 between 1990 to 2013 and 1966 to 1989			1
places where the ground was snow - covered up to 25 per cent more frequently in recent decades are coloured in shades of blue , and places that were snow - covered up to 25 per cent less frequently are coloured shades of brown			2
the colour blue indicates areas where the ground was more frequently snow - covered in recent years , and the map below shows the percent change in snow - covered days over the week of @entity14 between 1990 to 2013 and 1966 to 1989			1
' many of us wondered whether we could trust our memories of how snowy the holidays were when we were kids compared to now , ' the @entity31 's climate team wrote			0
' just for fun , we asked the experts at the @entity38 to show us what their data ( based on @entity41 satellite images ) had to say about whether the @entity44 snow extent during the week of @entity14 has changed at all in the past 50 years			1
' as you can see , fans of glistening tree tops have had a better time in the past few years - there seem to have been more white christmases between 1990 to 2013 in the @entity44 ' places where the ground was snow - covered up to 25 per cent more frequently in recent decades are coloured in shades of blue , and places that were snow - covered up to 25 per cent less frequently are coloured shades of brown			1
according to the @entity38 , there has been a modest increase in snow extent during the holiday week today compared to the past for the country as a whole , although it clearly varies a lot from place to place			0
further , the scientists emphasize , singling out a particular winter week for scrutiny is n’t especially meaningful as an indicator of long - term climate change			0
there seem to have been more white christmases between 1990 to 2013 than between 1966 to 1989 in the @entity44 when it comes to meaningful indicators of how snow has changed over time , the scientists say , it ’s best to stick to monthly or seasonal averages			1
by those indicators , says @entity78 , who leads the @entity38 snow lab project , the pattern is clear : @entity82 snow cover is declining significantly at the end of the cold season ( spring / early summer )			0
this pattern of snow disappearing earlier in the spring makes intuitive sense with respect to global warming			0
as temperatures rise , the impact on snow cover is likely to show up first in those seasons where the temperature is just barely cold enough for snow			0
reductions in snow can also feed back on the atmosphere , amplifying warming			0
where winter temperatures are well below freezing , however , temperatures will have to rise more significantly before snow cover is affected .			0
