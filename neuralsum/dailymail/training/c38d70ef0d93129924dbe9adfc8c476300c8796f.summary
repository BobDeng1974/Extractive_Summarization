a judgment approved by the @entity26 also barred her from applying to lift the order at a later date			0
ms @entity1 , who was awarded a cbe in 2010 for services to teaching , resigned from her post a the school in @entity33 last year while the government launched a probe			1
it found she had used school funds for ' inappropriate purposes '			0

she also claimed on expenses for posh dinners , personal taxi rides and nearly £ 3,500 in flowers			2
today 's judgement issued by a professional conduct panel found that she had been a ' force for good ' in many respects - but that her expenses claims ' undermined ' the entire teaching profession			0
the staggering bill for her 50th birthday party in 2011 included money spent on catering , alcohol , food , party lights and ' landscaping ' - as well as extra pay for the staff 's time			1
that money was not paid back for more than a year			0
ms @entity1 admitted the allegations , the judgement says			2
ms @entity1 , pictured meeting the @entity66 in 2007 to receive a cbe for services to education , resigned last year the panel said her ' unacceptable ' claims at @entity71 ' undermined ' the entire profession she also admitted taking on paid work for speaking at conferences and consultancy during term time			1
her personal assistant was instructed to carry out non-school related tasks such as organising her public speaking engagements , booking flights for her family and arranging the rental of her holiday home			0
the panel said : ' in light of the panel ’s findings against ms @entity1 , which involved making numerous and extensive expenses claims in respect of public money , over a significant period of time for personal gain , there is a strong public interest consideration in maintaining public confidence in the profession			2
' this is particularly so in ms @entity1 ’s case , in light of her high national profile as an influential figure in the education world and public recognition as @entity106 and her receipt of a cbe			0
' this high profile increases the risk of public confidence in the profession being undermined			0
ms @entity1 , who has previously been named as headteacher of the year , spent nearly £ 3,500 on flowers ms @entity1 can not apply to lift the life ban as she showed ' a lack of insight into the severity of her behaviours ' ' @entity117 is also of the view that in the climate of recent years , the public interest in maintaining public confidence in the management of public finances , including ensuring that expenses claims against public funds are appropriate , is particularly strong			1
' accordingly , the @entity117 considers that public confidence in the profession could be seriously weakened if conduct such as that found against ms @entity1 were not treated with the utmost seriousness when regulating the conduct of the profession			0
' it added that while ms @entity1 had admitted her wrongdoing she had also showed ' a lack of insight into the severity and impact of her behaviours '			0
