by @entity0 a mysterious beast that has been attacking cattle has been killed on a farm in @entity4 , baffling people living nearby and the local vet with its bizarre appearance			1
this freakish monstrosity , which some cynics might say looks a lot like a normal woodland animal , had been attacking cows and calves by savagely biting their feet , drawing parallels to the chupacabra of @entity18 legend			1
the vet is at a loss as to what the creature is , claiming two similar creatures have been spotted in the region , but they both managed to evade their pursuers by melting into the forests like supernatural beings			1
or small woodland animals , which the body closely resembles			0
is this monstrous beast , killed by a @entity32 farmhand , the legendary chupacabra or is there a more pedestrian explanation ? we may never know ... the region 's hunters are also at a loss			1
some of them believe it is a mutant amalgam of a number of species because it resembles a hyena , has the features of a fox , a raccoon and a dog , reports @entity49			0
the vet described it as a ' sensation ' and vowed to burn the corpse of the killed animal			1
presumably in case it comes back to life			0
but an earlier discovery may be the key to unlocking this mystery			2
a @entity62 farmer killed a similar animal last year and gave the body of the animal to biologists			2
speculation was rife about the creature , with some claiming that it could be a ' mutant ' fox poisoned by radiation , while another theory was that it was a hybrid originating from a secret @entity74 plant conducting tests on animals relating to chemical or biological weapons development			2
a fox mutated by radiation ? or the by - product of a sinister @entity74 experiment			2
no , according to @entity62 scientists , it 's a raccoon dog the biologists , however , pointed out it was a raccoon dog , which were be bred on @entity74 farms in 1939 , but were released into the wild when the @entity89 started			0
the @entity90 is a @entity18 monster that attacks livestock , usually goats , and drinks their blood			1
the name itself is derived from the @entity96 ' chupar ' ( ' to suck ' ) and ' cabra ' ( ' goat ' )			0
descriptions of them vary from reptilian with spikes or quills on its back to hairless dogs with fangs and claws			0
someone in @entity108 , @entity109 , sent this picture of a mangy dog - like creature into a local tv station with the caption : ' @entity90 's do exist ' since the legend of the mythical @entity118 predator first emerged , there have been ' sightings ' of the @entity90 all over the world			1
one of these took place earlier this week in @entity108 , @entity109 , after a local spotted a mangy , fox - like creature fitting with the description bestowed on the ' goat - sucker ' or ' devil - dog '			1
a picture was taken by a woman called @entity129 who sent it into a local news site with the caption , ' @entity90 do exist ! scientists have speculated that the creatures could be coyotes infected by parasites after one animal was discovered last july following a fatal attack on livestock			0
the first reported sighting was in 1995 , when eight sheep were found dead in @entity142 with identical puncture wounds to the chest and completely drained of blood			0
their mysterious deaths supposedly spawned the legend of the chupacabra in @entity18			1
months later , the creature was allegedly spotted in @entity151 , where as many as 150 animals had been killed			0
since then , there have been attacks allegedly carried out by the creature across @entity156 and @entity157 , and even into @entity158 and @entity159 .			0

*terrified* locals say mystery *surrounds* creature , which had attacked cattle
vet is at a loss to explain the animal - and has vowed to burn it
could it be the chupacabra of @entity18 legend ?
