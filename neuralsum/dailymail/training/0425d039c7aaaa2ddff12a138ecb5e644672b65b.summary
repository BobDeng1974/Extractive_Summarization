looking for a high - impact dish to grace your @entity2 lunch table ? the latest foodie craze is to serve up a bombe			1
traditionally , these are dome - shaped @entity7 desserts made from ice - cream , so - called because they ’re shaped like a cannonball or bomb , and with a hidden ‘ exploding ’ liquid or surprise centre			1
but this holiday season they come in all flavours and guises — often with a special surprise in the middle			1
here , @entity19 rates the bombes that will add a taste explosion to any festive feast — and the ones best left off the menu			2
double chocolate @entity25 £ 15 , www.cookfood.net , 550g ( main picture ) verdict : this huge chocolate bombe feeds ten people — but once they reach the soft raspberry toffee ‘ surprise ’ in the middle , it could turn into a brawl as they all try to get some more			1
believe me , it ’s much more delicious than it sounds			2
the outside layer is made from chocolate sponge , soaked in sweet @entity39 wine , and covered with a dusting of cocoa			1
@entity42 is rich chocolate mousse and whipped cream — with the raspberry toffee centre			1
it comes ready to eat			2
perfect for a dinner party — and as it looks homemade , you could pretend you ’ve made it yourself			1
5/5 @entity25 around £ 34 ( varies according to size ) , @entity52 verdict : this savoury bombe features layers of bacon on the outside , turkey on the inside and a centre filling of sage and onion stuffing			1
needs baking according to instructions			2
i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the thick , succulent bacon , which could be straight from the farm			0
there were more than 22 rashers layered so beautifully on top that it felt like a crime to carve through them			0
the turkey is tasty and matches the bacon for quality , and as you carve through the bombe each layer of bacon , turkey and delicious stuffing falls away in perfect appetising slices			1
a winner if you want the wow factor			0
4/5 @entity85 £ 5 for 650g , @entity86 verdict : this stuffing bombe looks so spectacular it could outshine the @entity2 turkey			1
the size and shape of a medium @entity2 pudding — it serves eight to ten — the edges are artfully lined with thin delicious - looking orange slices			1
the first problem is removing it from the plastic bowl			0
i slid a knife into the side and gently eased it out			0
then you pop it in the oven			0
when finished , it looks impressive with a golden crust on the stuffing and the pretty orange slices glistening			0
but oh dear , the taste			0
it contained so much cinnamon and spice , it was like tasting a mouthful of @entity2 potpourri — horrible ! if only this tasted as good as it looks			1
2/5 @entity117 ’s hidden orange christmas pudding £ 15 for 1.5kg , @entity119 verdict : this is the original surprise - in - the - middle ( therefore qualifying it as a bombe ) pudding produced by the master of molecular gastronomy			1
launched in 2010 , this helped create the current bombe trend			1
this year they cost £ 15 — if you are lucky enough to find one on the shelves			1
preparation is relatively time - consuming — it has to be steamed for three hours			1
alternatively , it can be microwaved for around eight minutes			0
but it ’s hugely satisfying to cut into the pudding and hear the squelch of the whole candied orange — one which has been previously soaked and preserved in sugar syrup — buried in the middle			2
its delicious citrussy juices and flavour infuse the fruity surroundings			0
the combined taste of sweet orange and @entity2 pudding is glorious			1
5/5 @entity148 christmas pudding £ 4 for 454g , @entity150 verdict : @entity150 have cheekily come up with the little brother of @entity153 ’s bombes — a @entity2 pudding with a smaller @entity155 inside instead of an orange			1
you steam it for one hour , or microwave for three minutes			0
it ’s not only just as tasty as @entity153 ’s bigger orange version , but the @entity150 pudding has less saturated fat — 2.9g per 100g compared to 3.4g			2
i ’d recommend @entity150 for smaller gatherings of four or so , and @entity153 for a larger group			0
5/5 finest @entity166 £ 2.50 for 227g , @entity150 verdict : the middle contains a thick dollop of melting chocolate , which is n’t exactly unexpected but tastes delicious all the same			0
gloriously rich , it even defeated the appetite of my 13 - year - old son @entity172 , who stopped halfway through his second helping , declaring : ‘ if i eat any more of this bombe i ’ll explode ! ’ 3/5 @entity176 £ 4.99 per 35g bombe , www.selfridges.co.uk verdict : pile these on to your @entity2 table and they ’ll look more like decorations			1
mine were just so pretty i stuck them in a tree			0
these are different flavoured chocolate bombes each wrapped in a small hexagon - shaped , brightly coloured cardboard box			1
inside each is a domed chocolate bombe , crafted by petit four company @entity192 ’s			2
choose from a variety of flavours such as espresso , peanut butter , praline and @entity199 biscuit			2
my favourite , however , has to be pavlova			0
far too good for children — but the perfect way for adults to round off a @entity2 meal ! 4/5 @entity206 and @entity207 £ 6 for 810g , the co-operative verdict : the co-op has been turning quietly foodie this last year , with some surprisingly delicious products			1
this one will look really attractive on any @entity2 table and better still , is ready to serve			1
there ’s white chocolate ‘ snowflakes ’ on the outside , and inside the bombe is a brown chocolate sponge , with a surprising middle of melting dark chocolate			2
this gives a snow - capped ‘ wow ’ factor to your table , but i found it a bit too sweet and sugary for an adult palate			2
one slice was more than enough			0
my kids , however , felt otherwise and greedily asked for seconds			0
3/5 @entity232 with chilli and @entity233 £ 3.00 for 250g , @entity150 verdict : warning — do n’t feed this to your children without telling them about the chilli			0
i made that mistake and all three complained their mouths were on fire			2
it is a great twist for your cheeseboard though , and because of the dome shape it looks far more impressive than a simple block of cheese			2
there ’s a dramatic topping of red pepper and chilli flakes			0
the chilli and red pepper is flecked throughout the delicious orange - coloured cheddar cheese , and each bite brings a new flavour			2
a great way to make cheese and biscuits more interesting , although some might find the chilli kick a bit too intense			0
3/5 @entity263 £ 4.40 for 550g , lepain @entity264 verdict : it may look like a simple , cocoa - covered bombe			1
but cut inside , and the soft @entity268 chocolate mousse is so tasty you wo n’t be able to stop eating			0
rather than a surprise in the middle , this has a surprise base of soft almond biscuit			0
so good that you will find room for more — and it ’s not too rich for adults or children			0
5/5 @entity279 christmas pudding @entity25 £ 3 for 250g , @entity150 verdict : if you want to confuse your mother - in - law after the @entity2 lunch , serve up this @entity2 pudding - shaped @entity279			1
it certainly does n’t resemble any @entity279 she ’s ever tried before			0
it is topped with dried cranberries , and inside there ’s a host of other dried fruit such as apricots , dates , and raisins			0
great if you love dried fruit , but i found the hint of alcohol from the @entity298 extract in the cheese too sickening			0
imagine cheese crossed with @entity2 pudding , and this is the over-complicated and unappetising flavour you get here			1

serving a bombe instead of @entity2 pudding is this year *'s* latest craze
traditionally these dome - shaped @entity7 desserts are made from ice - cream
