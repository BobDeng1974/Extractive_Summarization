by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent rebel : @entity3 claims @entity4 have neglected the votes of ethnic minorities in favour of white voters @entity9 has left it too late to win next year ’s general election because he has failed to woo the ethnic minorities , @entity3 warned yesterday			1
in a further salvo after resigning from the government over @entity15 , she claimed that the prime minister ’s ‘ public school ’ allies did not understand modern @entity19			1
she also claimed that some of mr @entity9 ’s inner circle had dismissed her – the first @entity22 female cabinet minister – as being not up to the job because she was a ‘ brown , working - class woman ’			1
last night a @entity24 mp criticised @entity3 , saying if the @entity4 were not winning the ethnic minority vote that was her fault as much as anyone ’s because she had been minister for community cohesion			1
@entity29 , the mp for @entity30 and @entity31 in @entity32 , claimed that she had ‘ embarrassed herself ’			1
he added : ‘ i think within a week , “ who was @entity3 ? ” will be the question			1
she has ended her career in many ways			2
’ @entity3 quit as a @entity39 minister last week , saying the government ’s position on the @entity15 crisis – and its failure to properly criticise @entity44 – was ‘ morally indefensible ’			1
mr @entity9 had given her a job in his first cabinet as party chairman in an attempt to give the @entity4 a more modern face			2
@entity3 was later moved to the @entity39 – widely seen as a demotion – and given a job as faith minister charged with improving community cohesion			1
in a newspaper interview yesterday , she said @entity24 bosses were ignoring ‘ electoral reality ’ by relying on white voters			1
the peer , who comes from a working - class background in @entity32 , said : ‘ the electoral reality is that we will not win outright @entity24 majorities until we start attracting more of the ethnic vote			1
' we ’ve probably left it a little too late to take this part of the electorate seriously			0
’ rounding on criticism of her , she said : ‘ some of the bitchiest women i ’ve ever met in my life are the men in politics			1
‘ i am a brown , working - class woman from the @entity76			0
people have been telling me i ’m not good enough since the day i was born			0
’ in a reference to mr @entity9 ’s inner circle , she added : ‘ i do n’t hold the fact that someone went to public school against them			0
‘ i do n’t hold the fact that they have n’t had the breadth of experience that some of us who did n’t go to public school have had			0
‘ i hope that if i can be so understanding about their background and shortcomings , they can be understanding to those of us who have n’t had those opportunities			0
’ in a reference to mr @entity9 ’s inner circle , she added : ' i hope that if i can be so understanding about their background and shortcomings , they can be understanding to those of us who have n’t had those opportunities ’ @entity3 called on the government to recognise @entity107 as a state and impose an arms embargo on @entity44			2
she criticised @entity110 and @entity111 for failing to use their ‘ very , very close ’ relations with the @entity44 government to defuse the crisis			0
dismissing the chancellor ’s claim that her resignation had been ‘ unnecessary ’ , she said : ‘ my actions would not have been necessary if he had done what he should have done , which is pick up the phone to people he is incredibly close to and say , “ it ’s unnecessary for you to meet your ends by taking out power stations , taking out homes , taking out schools and killing kids on beaches ”			0
' @entity133 has given his clearest indication yet that he hopes to lead the @entity24 , saying he has shown in @entity135 he had the ‘ ruthless energy ’ to get things done			2
he said he ran for the job of @entity135 mayor six years ago to ‘ show what i can do ’			0
asked if he wanted to follow @entity9 as leader , he replied : ‘ i would certainly say i know an awful lot about administration and public service now			0
’ mr @entity133 last week announced he would seek to return to @entity145			0
he is said to be in talks to contest the @entity148 and @entity149 seat in west @entity135			0
a poll yesterday put him in the lead to succeed mr @entity9 – with 34 per cent of all voters and half of @entity24 supporters wanting him to take over			1
in a @entity156 interview yesterday , he also took a swipe at arch - rival @entity110 , denouncing the chancellor ’s ‘ lack of vision ’ in dismissing his idea of an airport in the @entity160			0
one mp said mr @entity133 ’s allies wanted a repeat of the 2010 election when the @entity4 were the largest party but did not win a majority			2
the @entity133 faction could then join @entity170 to vote down a @entity24 - @entity172 coalition and he would ‘ storm through ’ a subsequent leadership race .			2

@entity176 came after first @entity22 female cabinet minister resigned over @entity15
she said *conservatives* ignoring ' electoral reality ' by relying on white voters
@entity24 mp @entity29 fired back , saying she had ' embarrassed herself '
but @entity3 said : ' some of the bitchiest women are men in politics '
