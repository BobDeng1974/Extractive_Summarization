by @entity1 reporter sitting on the pavement next to his dog and sleeping bag , @entity2 looked to all the world like a homeless beggar			1
but what the passers - by who gave him cash did n’t know was that he was earning over £ 50,000 a year and living in a £ 300,000 council flat in west @entity13			1
at the end of every day he would pick up his handwritten sign and head back to his @entity17 @entity16 say he regularly went into bookmakers and amusement shops to change up his loose coins			1
the homeless man ... with a home : @entity2 ( left ) has been given an asbo after it emerged he had been begging for years despite living in a plush £ 300,000 flat in this block ( right ) in @entity17 on many occasions they added up to between £ 200 and £ 300			1
magistrates have now imposed a two - year @entity23 banning him from begging anywhere in @entity13			1
@entity32 @entity31 , who brought the case to court , said : ‘ he had a reputation for getting a lot of gifts while begging			0
' he used a sign saying he was homeless and people gave him money on that basis , which is clearly fraud			0
he would take the money from his cup and change it over at a local betting shop or amusement arcade			0
‘ he worked pretty much every day , and had done so for about three years			0
he certainly put in the hours			0
’ @entity2 proved @entity47 in south - west @entity13 was such a lucrative venue that he attracted up to nine other beggars			1
since his arrest , they have all but disappeared			0
@entity2 would sit wearing ragged clothes outside @entity54 bank in @entity47 , near @entity47 station , with his dog and ask the public for money			1
but after a hard day ’s begging @entity2 would pack up his sleeping bag and , instead of heading to a shelter , he would make his way across @entity64 to his comfortable flat in @entity66 , @entity17			1
commuters who fell for his bad luck story said they were shocked to learn @entity2 had duped them			2
@entity69 , from @entity47 , said : ' i definitely gave him money over the years			2
i wonder if i can get that back ? ' in december 2012 suspicious residents were suggesting that something was not quite right about @entity2 ’s predicament			2
some said he changed up his donations in @entity78 in @entity47 while others said he lived in a tent on @entity81			2
but @entity2 ’s days of fleecing the public are over after magistrates slapped an asbo on him banning him from visiting the @entity86 area ( @entity87 and @entity47 ) and from begging anywhere in the capital			1
@entity91 @entity90 , sitting on may 14 , also ordered him to keep his dog muzzled and under control at all times in a public place after magistrates were told it had bitten at least one person			0
banned : @entity2 , 37 , would sit wearing ragged clothes outside @entity54 bank in @entity47 , near @entity47 station , with his dog and ask the public for money the asbo will remain in place until may 2015 but if @entity2 , who admitted fraud and begging , breaches any of its terms he could be sent to prison for up to five years and face an unlimited fine			1
the council ’s community safety spokesman @entity110 @entity110 said : ' anyone who lives , works or shops in and around @entity47 will be mightily relieved to see this unpleasant individual given his marching orders			2
' he deliberately targeted people making cash withdrawals from this cashpoint and was extremely aggressive and abusive to anyone who refused to give him money			0
' many people felt frightened and intimidated by him and there is some evidence to suggest that he used his dog to threaten and pressure people into handing over their cash			0
' his behaviour was an absolute disgrace			0
the fact that he was actually living in a comfortable flat in @entity17 , something that many of his victims can only dream of , just adds insult to injury			0
' everyone who has been appalled by mr @entity2 ’s behaviour will i ’m sure wish to congratulate the @entity140 , especially pc @entity31 , who was the officer in the case and also the @entity143 whose lawyers worked so closely with the police to bring about this very positive result for @entity47			2

@entity2 , 37 , sat in ragged clothes with his dog in @entity47
packed up sleeping bag at end of day and headed to plush @entity17 home
handed an asbo banning him from begging in @entity13 or entering @entity86
duped commuter : ' i gave him about £ 20 . i wonder if i can get that back ? '
