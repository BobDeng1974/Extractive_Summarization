we are all guilty of taking the odd cheesy tourist photo , be it trying to push the @entity3 , or ' touch ' the top of a pyramid			0
one traveller in particular knows how wrong a holiday snap can go , after he posted a picture online of him ' missing ' the top of the @entity12 and asked users to help improve his photo			2
on a recent trip to @entity18 , @entity16 food blogger @entity15 enjoyed poking fun at those tourist clich√©s and took a couple of pictures deliberately missing some of the more famous monuments			1
little did he know he would become an internet sensation , after his photo with the @entity12 captioned ' nailed it ' was uploaded to photosharing website 4chan			2
since then over 100 photoshopped pictures have sprung up comically connecting his finger with the tip of the famous attraction , and it did n't stop there ... nailed it ! @entity15 , 37 , uploaded this photograph on social media in a bid to poke fun of the typical tourist pictures going viral ! an upload on photo - sharing site 4chan requested users connect his finger with the top of the tower , as many tourist pictures aim to achieve the 37 - year - old said he thought it would be hilarious to deliberately make fun of the typical pictures with famous landmarks			1
' the original pictures in which me and my friends ' nailed it ' were an instant hit with my friends as soon as i posted them on @entity60 , ' @entity15 said			0
' there were people that thought we just took poor pictures but luckily most of my friends know better			0
' obviously the internet had something to say about the pictures and after someone uploaded the pictures to 4chan , users from all over the globe submitted their own ' improved ' versions of @entity15 's pictures			2
created images ranged from the comical , with the 301m tower bent over to touch his outstretched finger , to the absurd , with @entity15 imposed into @entity80 's @entity79 , reaching out towards the @entity12			1
the wondrous offerings demonstrate what a brilliant place the internet is , and how no one 's holiday pictures are safe			0
@entity88 tower ! the tower appears to have flopped over in the summer heat , making a connection with the food blogger 's finger cut out ! despite covering the 37 - year - old , his finger is clearly in contact in this picture ! expert photoshopping creates a miniature tower touching his finger , never mind about the gaping white hole left behind ! close enough ! tilting the tower 45 degrees , and extending his arm in an octopus fashion were methods used to ' improve ' the picture super hero ! in a @entity110 - like fashion , not only has @entity15 knocked over the @entity12 , but also has it grasped in two fingers @entity15 is shocked but highly entertained at the widespread response to his holiday pictures			1
' i can honestly say that we have had as much fun taking these silly pictures as we have had the week after overviewing the hilarious aftermath			0
' some of the photoshopped pictures are just brilliant			0
' @entity12 touches @entity15 ! this photo plays on role reversal with the tower spectacularly missing touching him basically there ! a longer arm is all it takes to recreate the popular tourist pose if in doubt , enlarge the poser ( left ) , or do as most people do and stand closer to the camera ! or why not create more failed fingers ( right ) to add to the picture ? why not just duplicate the offending failed finger all over the @entity12 ? ( still without it making contact ! ) see double ! that works ! not only does he touch the top , he does it twice in this picture a portal has allowed the tip of the tower to protrude near the blogger 's feet so he can touch the tip why not ignore the failed hand all together , and just reposition it on top ? job done ! ( left ) or why not reverse the original photograph ? ( right ) so elegant ! the original pose has been imposed on a ballerina dancing on a studio another wondrous offering from the internet shows him expertly defending a basketball hoop the internet wins again ! @entity15 ( as @entity159 ) reaching out for the @entity12 ( as man ) in @entity162 's famous painting , @entity79 bullrilliant ! @entity15 becomes a matador unperturbed by a bull with horns consisting of the @entity12			1
