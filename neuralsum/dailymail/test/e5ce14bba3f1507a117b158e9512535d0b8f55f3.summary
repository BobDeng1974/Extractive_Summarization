@entity0 had n't seen his teenage cousin in 10 years when she added him on @entity2 in december			1
the 23 - year - old @entity4 student was enjoying semester break and training hard in the hope of one day representing @entity7 as a champion sprinter			1
he messaged his 17 - year - old cousin @entity9 * ( name has been changed for legal reasons ) to see how she was doing and soon found out she was homeless , illiterate and 32 weeks pregnant			1
mr @entity0 picked her up from where she was sleeping rough on the @entity13 , let her move into his flat , took care of her through the final stage of her pregnancy and is now helping to raise her four - week - old baby boy			1
@entity0 , a 23 - year - old @entity4 student , took in his homeless , pregnant 17 - year - old cousin and his helping her raise her four - week - old baby boy the 23 - year - old @entity4 student says he did n't think twice about helping her ' i went and picked her up and she basically started telling me about her situation , which was hard for me to hear because she was my favourite little cousin when i was growing up , ' he told @entity24			1
' to my knowledge she was ok ... but in reality she was n't at all			0
' basically she was living on the streets , she became addicted to ice and was doing terrible things to get by			0
she did n't have anything			0
' mr @entity0 said @entity9 – whose last year of schooling was @entity31 – had stopped taking hard drugs by the time she was 15 but at 16 she fell pregnant , and her baby 's father was sent to prison soon afterward			1
by the time mr @entity0 met up with her she was 32 weeks pregnant , and he said he did n't think twice about taking her in			1
' it 's not her fault she 's just a little girl who needed help , ' he said			0
@entity9 ( not her real name ) added mr @entity0 on @entity41 after they had n't seen each other in 10 years ' obviously i 'm not going to let her stay on the streets			1
' everyone likes to tell me this is such a big responsibility , but i was n't thinking about uni or work or anything , all i was doing was thinking that she needed me			2
' because mr @entity0 was on university holidays at the time he had been working full time in his job at a fruit and vegetable wholesaler and he had saved $ 2800 , just enough to cover the cost of moving into a new house and buying items for the baby			2
he put his athletics training on hold so he could work enough hours to save money , but he returned to university as normal at the beginning of march because he did n't want to delay his studies			0
mr @entity0 ( pictured in the @entity64 while studying there in 2013 ) still studies and works three days per week to support the three of them when @entity9 gave birth to her baby @entity68 * ( name has been changed ) on march 17 , he was finishing off university assignments due the next day in the hospital waiting room			1
' i went into uni the day after , i had n't slept but i needed to do a presentation , ' he said			0
now that @entity68 is four weeks old , mr @entity0 continues to go to class and is working three days per week to support the three of them			1
and while many other 23 - year - olds would rather be spending their spare time partying with friends or travelling , he says he does n't mind the impact that looking after @entity9 and @entity68 is having on his social life			1
' my closest mates are from training , so they 're athletes , and they do n't go out all the time , ' he said			0
' most of the time they work , train and study , so i 'm around a good crew of people			0
' his brother @entity90 has started a @entity93 fundraising page in an effort to make mr @entity0 , @entity9 and @entity68 's financial situation more stable			1
mr @entity0 said that , since sharing his story online , he has been getting messages from people all over @entity7 congratulating him for what he is doing			2
the champion sprinter says he does n't mind the impact of his social life , as most of his friends are athletes and do n't spend their spare time partying ' i know what i 've done is a really good thing but i feel guilty i 'm getting all this attention , ' he said			0
' we 've had all these messages which has made us realise there are so many other people in this situation , i do n't want people to think it 's a unique thing			0
' i ca n't believe how many people have been in these shoes before , and have had no help or support when they were pregnant			0
' mr @entity0 added that he was n't worried about how his situation would affect his plans to start his own family one day			2
' growing up everyone thinks about that stuff but you ca n't control that sort of stuff , it 's not something that came into my head , ' he said			0
' at first when @entity68 came into the world i did n't have an emotional attachment , all i was doing was looking after @entity9			2
' but i really do care for him and in a way he is my kid , i 've taken on the father role as you 'd imagine			0
' @entity9 does 90 per cent of the work – and if it 's one or two years of my life i have to put on hold to make sure two lives are going to be saved it 's nothing at all			2
' ' if it 's one or two years of my life i have to put on hold to make sure two lives are going to be saved it 's nothing at all , ' said mr @entity0 , pictured with his friend and fellow athlete @entity143			2
