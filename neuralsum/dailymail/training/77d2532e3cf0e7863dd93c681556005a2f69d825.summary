by @entity0 published : 11:17 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 13:19 est , 13 january 2014 @entity3 's flooding nightmare is set to continue this week , as renewed rainfall swells rivers and inundates areas which have been underwater for weeks			1
many regions have suffered on and off from flooding since before @entity10 , with rivers at dangerous levels and vast areas of land saturated with floodwater			2
after a mild weekend many areas appeared tranquil today - but with more rain set to fall across the @entity19 , householders will feel yet more pain over the next few days			1
calm : but although areas such as @entity23 in @entity24 appeared tranquil today , more flooding chaos is on the way for most of @entity3 as heavy rain falls on saturated ground and swollen rivers @entity29 : the morning sky over the countryside around @entity32 in @entity33 today eight people have died and more than 1,700 homes and businesses have been flooded in @entity37 since the beginning of the @entity10 period			1
the @entity40 today warned that @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity24 and the @entity43 would face continued flooding , with heavy rain forecast for wednesday			1
in addition , rivers are at worryingly high levels in @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity42 and along the @entity53			0
the agency added that wednesday 's predicted rain would fall on ' already saturated ground ' , increasing the flood risk and prolonging the time it will take for affected areas to recover			1
there are more than 150 flood warnings and alerts currently in place , with much of @entity65 and the @entity66 warned to stay vigilant			1
forecast : heavy rain will arrive on wednesday , causing chaos in flood - affected areas be prepared : more than 150 flood warnings and alerts were today in place across the @entity19 ' there is a continued risk of flooding in southern @entity65 , especially @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity24 and the @entity43 , and we urge people to remain vigilant and prepared to take action , ' a spokesman for the @entity40 said today			1
' @entity40 teams are out on the ground , maintaining flood defences , clearing watercourses and deploying pumps and temporary defences to protect communities at risk			2
' a pest control company has predicted that the widespread flooding will encourage an ' influx of rats ' by forcing the rodents to seek shelter on high ground away from rivers			0
@entity96 of @entity97 said : â € ˜ the rats are simply trying to find dry places to live			0
' rats like water and are good swimmers but they canâ € ™ t tolerate being submerged for long periods and can drown			0
' @entity105 : a daffodil which has survived the storms to bloom in a garden near @entity109 in @entity41 bursting through : the growth of the flowers has been encouraged by the mild temperatures householders are advised not to tackle the rats themselves as they can become aggressive if they are cornered and there is a risk of being bitten			2
however , it 's not all bad news about the weather - in a public garden in @entity41 , one plucky daffodil defied the turbulent weather and flowered three months ahead of schedule			0
the flower emerged from the ground at @entity126 near @entity109 in @entity41 last week			0
despite the storms , temperatures have been relatively mild for january , with the thermometer rising as high as @entity130			0
' it is quite unusual to see these daffodils flowering so early , ' said curator @entity133			0
' we thought the cold december might push it back a bit , but we have had mild temperatures this january that seem to be the reason it is in full bloom so early			2

@entity40 warns of more flooding across the @entity19
more than 150 flood warnings and alerts were in place today
heavy rain set to fall on wednesday , swelling rivers and flooding land
but the mild temperatures have caused daffodils to flower in some areas
