there are 256 brigadiers and generals but just 200 @entity8 tanks , according to the figures uncovered by a former senior military intelligence officer			1

alarming : new figures have found there are more than 250 brigadiers and generals in the @entity1 but there are just 200 active @entity8 tanks the disturbing imbalances were discovered by @entity27 , who served on the frontline in @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31			1
‘ our priorities are hugely skewed , ’ he said			1
‘ the @entity1 is over-burdened and over-staffed with senior ranks			2
‘ we need to think about cutting top brass and the focus now should be on our conflicts rather than promotion			2
’ he believes retaining so many one - star generals and above earning £ 100,000 - a - year plus while cutting spending is devastating morale in the @entity43			1
one tank officer said : ‘ when the @entity46 is making large cuts to equipment and personnel , the troops are rightly going to question why we need to retain so many well - paid senior officers living a good life			1
’ the @entity52 is suffering a similar plight with more admirals than active warships , according to an 2008 study			2
following the recent defence cuts , the senior service now has just 20 fighting surface ships , which are destroyers and frigates			2
rare sight : the @entity1 has three times more senior officers than it does @entity16 attack helicopters mr @entity27 ’s figures were gleaned from official statistics and published in his new book losing @entity68 : @entity69 in @entity29 and @entity19			1
he claims only around 200 of the @entity72 ’s force of 350 @entity8 main battle tanks are in service , with the others in storage			1

it also needs to eliminate a £ 38billion deficit in the equipment programme			2
at a peak during @entity85 , @entity72 produced more than 30,000 tanks			0
the @entity8 main battle tank is considered the most complex vehicle in the nation ’s arsenal			0

challenger iis were used in @entity29 in 2003 but the difficult terrain of @entity19 means they have not been deployed there			0
instead , the regiment has transferred its skills to a new range of more manoeuvrable armoured vehicles , including @entity105 and @entity106 , in the fight against the @entity108			0
the @entity1 currently has more than 3,000 armoured vehicles			0
the @entity46 believes the @entity1 can cope with fewer tanks as traditional heavy warfare will be replaced by more counter-insurgency campaigns , such as in @entity19			0
last night the @entity46 said the number of senior officers had dropped slightly from the figures obtained this year by mr @entity27			1
a spokesman said : ‘ as we restructure for the future , we are reducing the number of senior officers , which currently stands at about 230			1
‘ modern armies require more than just tanks			0
operations require a range of armoured vehicles			0
’ under the spending cuts , the @entity43 will lose at least 22,000 soldiers , sailors and airmen within four years , more than ten per cent of their number			0
