by @entity0 for @entity1 fears over @entity4 's porous borders are growing as it is revealed that thousands of illegal immigrants are at large despite failing immigration checks figures show that there has been a dramatic increase in the proportion who vanish after failing checks once inside the country			1
less than one in four are subsequently caught - meaning they have avoided detection while still inside the country			1
less than one in four illegal immigrants are caught by @entity4 immigration staff after failing immigration checks once they have made their way into the country @entity23 , the chairman of the @entity24 home affairs select committee said the figures are a ' real concern ' considering the worsening ' security situation ' at @entity4 borders			1
the statistic obtained by @entity32 showed that 3,527 immigrants absconded after failing immigration checks last year			1
only 846 were found , meaning 76 per cent - around 2,700 - remained at large in the @entity4			2
although the number who were still at large following failed checks has fallen from 9,362 in 2010 to 3,527 last year , the record for catching them has worsened			2
@entity23 said the figures are a ' real concern ' considering the worsening ' security situation ' at @entity4 borders in 2010 , 58 per cent were subsequently caught , but by last year this figure had fallen to around a quarter ( 24 per cent )			1
the worrying statistics come after it was revealed that one in five travellers is not counted in and out of @entity4 against criminal and terror checks because of it failures and management blunders			1
catastrophic it failures and management blunders mean 20million passengers escape full screening every year			0
six million people arriving by train – which includes @entity58 – do not undergo advance checks			2
only 20 per cent of sea journeys are logged – the equivalent of ten million passengers slipping through the net without having their details compared against lists of killers and dangerous fanatics			0
a @entity69 spokesman said : ' we take all breaches seriously and are determined to tackle immigration abuse			0
' most of these breaches occur when individuals fail to keep reporting appointments			0
nobody has absconded from immigration detention or while under escort in 2013/14			0
' we have rigorous security arrangements in place and if an individual does abscond , we work closely with the police and other agencies to locate them			0
' breaches remain under investigation until the individual has been located or it has been established that they have left the @entity4 voluntarily			2
' this causes a time lag in the figures and closure rates for 2013 and previous years will therefore continue to increase as time goes on			0
