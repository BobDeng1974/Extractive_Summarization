from @entity0 to @entity1 , the list of celebrity men who have resorted to hair transplants to revitalise their balding manes is a long one			2
as a result , inquiries about the treatment have shot up by 260 per cent over the last 12 months while 59 per cent of men say they would consider the treatment if they started losing their hair			2
but as @entity13 , 49 , an unemployed former martial arts champion from @entity14 knows only too well , the fiddly surgery does n't always go to plan			1
botched : @entity13 , 49 , was left bald and scarred following six bungled hair transplant operations embarrassed : mr @entity13 , who is unemployed , said his confidence was wrecked by the bungle after he began losing his hair - and his confidence - at the age of 23 , he turned to surgery in a bid to fix the problem			1
but six operations and £ 7,000 later , mr @entity13 was left badly scarred and still bald			1
' they promised me there would be a really good result , ' he reveals			0
' they said the scarring would be invisible and that there would be full coverage at the front			0
' instead , after a bungling surgeon botched the operation , mr @entity13 was left with a small amount of wiry regrowth and a front section without any hair on it at all			1
' it looked horrendous , ' he adds			0
' it was growing like wire			0
emotionally , i was just broken			0
' the complex surgery , which involves carefully removing and then re-implanting up to 1500 delicate hair follicles , was repeated five times before mr @entity13 conceded defeat			1
shockingly , despite confronting the inept medic , the clinic refused to refund his money or compensate him for the damage			2
' i went back and explained to them that , really , they 'd wrecked my life and nothing happened , ' he explains			2
he adds : ' every day , when i leave the house , i try to wear a hat if i can help it			0
you go through all the emotions ... you get embarrassed , you get angry because you think , " how could i do such a stupid thing ? " ' painful : the back of his head was left badly scarred by the surgeon 's attempts to harvest follicles celebrity fans : @entity0 has confessed to having two hair transplants , while @entity1 has had one mr @entity13 , who appears in the latest episode of @entity72 documentary , botched up bodies , is now attempting to repair the damage by consulting another surgeon but may have to wait up to 18 months before his mangled hair grows back			1
' i would have expected to see a lot more hair growing on his head considering the amount of surgery he 's had , ' comments @entity83 - based hair restoration surgeon , dr @entity84			2
' i think the operations @entity86 has had , certainly in my opinion , are below @entity88 , because he 's had multiple scars where he should have had one or two scars			0
painful : hair transplants involve having up to 1500 hair follicles extracted and re-inserted into the scalp ' @entity94 , because there 's not enough hairs growing from one operation , let alone six , and thirdly , the hairs that are growing , the size of the grafts , the angles and directions are not giving him a natural appearance			0
' although mr @entity13 has since had a seventh operation in the professional hands of dr @entity84 , he still has more than a year to go before finding out whether his hopes of a full head of hair will be realised			1
' it 's been an improvement and hopefully it will progress a bit more , ' he says , adding : ' i 'm very excited about the future			0
' @entity13 appears on @entity118 , thursday night at 10pm on @entity72			1

@entity13 , 49 , was scarred and still bald after a botched hair transplant
further five operations failed to repair the damage and cost him £ 7,000
mr @entity13 , who is unemployed , says the bungled operations ' *ruined* my life '
