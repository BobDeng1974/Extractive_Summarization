how we are by @entity1 the two books on my desk could n’t be more different yet they share a similar aim : to nudge readers towards leading a better , happier life			1
one is big , one is small			0
one is a first book by a hitherto unknown health psychologist and therapist , the other is by an international media superstar			0
one is baggy and would have benefited from some pruning and shaping			0
the other is so distilled i ’d have liked more			0
@entity1 ’s ideas are dense , sometimes irritatingly pretentious , fascinating , jumbled and often profound			1
for 14 years , @entity6 has written a column called @entity26 in her own magazine @entity6 , and now they are collected in an appealing book that packs a bigger punch than expected @entity6 would probably be happy with the description ‘ homespun wisdom ’ yet her simply expressed thoughts resonate with the clarity of a small bell			1
both are , in essence personal journeys which invite readers to walk a little way in the author ’s shoes , then critically examine their own worn - out old footwear			2
how we are is the first volume of a promised trilogy with the grandly ambitious title , how to live			0
it will be followed by how we break and then how we mend			0
this is , in essence , self - help for literary intellectuals , who love @entity51 ( as i do ) but would probably regard reading @entity6 as beneath them			1
@entity6 's self - help book is more heartfelt and straightforward and by the way , i write in the conviction that in encouraging people to re-construct their lives , ‘ self - help ’ or personal development and inspirational books can do much good			1
bring them on , i say			0
there ’s a lot of need out there			2
@entity1 ’s aim is to make us understand how much of our lives settle into ‘ grooves ’ of habit , often without us being aware of the fact			1
from the routes we take to the way we dress ( some wonderfully well - observed insights here ) , our daily lives are circumscribed by set ways of thinking , feeling and acting which can render us ‘ stuck ’ in an unfulfilling present			1
change is terrifying — and yet the discomfort ( sometimes agony ) of shifting our habits is an essential part of the process			0
no pain , no gain , as they say			0
as an advice columnist , i recognise the truth ( in terms of my readers ’ problems ) of this : ‘			1
if the new is to become our new normal , if we are to get through to the end , we must be , for a while , overwhelmed			0
‘ these are the moments of truth , where we either give up or push on			2
’ the end of a relationship , or job , or working life			1
these are just some of the stages in life which require us to change			2
@entity1 introduces us to some of his family and friends to illustrate points — and lets us into some of the dilemmas of his own life to enable us to see how many small decisions , made each day , add up to cumulative change			1
for much of the book he appears to be saying , ‘ look at me , i ’m neurotic and make mistakes like the best of you and i ’m really , really terrified of writing this book , too			1
’ he writes : ‘ may i not falter			2
i am dedicating myself to this project on transformation in the hope it might be a transformative project			0
’ 3,000 people ... number of guests @entity6 has had on her show since it started in 1986 in other words , he wants to help himself			1
such self - consciousness can grate , but it ’s also endearing			2
similarly , his range of references might intimidate — or exhilarate			0
so his writing can be as indigestible as an over-rich meal , yet when he writes simply ( from the breath of his professional and personal experience ) , choosing to communicate directly , he can be uplifting : ‘			2
improvement happens , people get better			0
i mean better at living , at being who they are , at handling life with grace , humour and courage			0
’ those three qualities abound in @entity6 ’s collection			1
for 14 years , she has written a column called @entity26 in her own magazine @entity6 , and now they are collected in an appealing book that packs a bigger punch than expected			2
@entity6 is more open than @entity1 about the traumas of her life ; on the other hand , this is to be expected since her traumatic childhood is already in the public domain			1
@entity1 ’s ideas are dense , sometimes irritatingly pretentious , fascinating , jumbled and often profound yet there ’s still something sublime in the way she cuts to the chase : ‘ i know for sure that healing the wounds of the past is one of the biggest and most worthwhile challenges of life			1
it ’s important to know when and how you were programmed so you can change the program			0
and doing so is your responsibility , no one else ’s			0
that is the irrefutable law of the universe : we are each responsible for our own life			0
that thought does n’t need to be hedged about with theory or quotation			0
it ’s clear that @entity6 was determined to heal herself with the practice of mindfulness before it became a fashionable buzz - word			1
she says her ‘ number one spiritual practice is trying to live in the present moment ’ and yet there is nothing ’ new - age ’ about this @entity196 - @entity195 woman whom both peers and younger women rightly regard as such an inspiration			2
on the contrary , she revels in material possessions ( like her very own plane ) and friends and dogs and spending sundays in pyjamas			0
she says she lives in a condition of ‘ exhilarated contentment ’ yet you know it has been hard - won			1
she ’s struggled with her weight and with her memories of childhood abuse			0
the small book carries many messages , although professional therapists will judge sentences like this as embarrassingly over-simple : ‘ the creator has given you full responsibility for your life and with that responsibility comes an amazing privilege — the power to give yourself the love , affection and intimacy you may not have received as a child			2
’ yet there @entity6 is writing from the depths of her own life , and her message is one many people want — and need — to hear			1
@entity1 challenges the mind and @entity6 massages the soul — and all to the good , because both books could change lives .			1

@entity1 ’s ideas are dense , sometimes irritatingly pretentious , fascinating , jumbled and often profound
@entity6 would be happy with the description ‘ homespun wisdom ’
@entity1 ’s aim is to make us understand how much of our lives settle into ‘ grooves ’ of habit , often without us being aware
@entity6 is more open about the traumas of her life
