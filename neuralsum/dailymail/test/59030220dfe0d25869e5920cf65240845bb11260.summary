so it seems you are either with me or firmly against me : there does n’t appear to be a middle ground after my comments about @entity6			1
it is a week since i criticised @entity9 ’s goalkeeper for appearing to congratulate @entity10 at half - time during the @entity12 after the @entity14 striker beat him with a brilliant volley			1
i ’m still struggling to work out why @entity6 did what he did			1
i have nothing against @entity6 , personally or professionally			1
he ’s been one of the few players who have performed consistently for @entity9 in recent seasons , which led to him being part of @entity26 ’s @entity25 squad last summer			1
@entity9 keeper @entity6 congratulated @entity14 striker @entity10 on his goal at half - time @entity6 smiles at @entity10 shortly after the striker 's goal gave the @entity14 the lead in the @entity12 derby @entity34 's @entity33 criticised @entity6 for his half - time actions while speaking on @entity36 but coming together with an opponent and smiling after he ’s scored against you in a match of such importance ? no , i ’m sorry			1
i ca n’t understand why any player would feel the need to do that			1
at the end of the game ? that ’s not an issue — there is no more appropriate place for sportsmanship			2
think about the iconic image of @entity52 and @entity53 swapping shirts after @entity55 had beaten @entity56 1 - 0 at the 1970 @entity25 or how two boxers will embrace after they have gone the distance — that is fantastic to see			2
when @entity62 beat @entity63 in the 2005 @entity65 semi-final at @entity66 , the first thing i did at the final whistle was go over to see @entity67 to offer my respects for how well he ’d played over the two legs			2
would i have told him that at half - time with the game in the balance ? no chance ! we were talking about this subject at @entity36 on monday morning			2
i bumped into former @entity56 rugby centre @entity76 and he told me a story about the end of the @entity81 final in 2003 , when @entity83 ’s @entity82 scored a penalty with the last kick to take the game into extra-time			2
@entity52 ( left ) and @entity53 hug and swap shirts after the 1970 @entity25 match between @entity55 and @entity56 @entity82 ( left ) levels the @entity94 final with the last kick of normal time @entity97 celebrates his winner for @entity62 against @entity63 in the 2005 @entity65 semi-finals @entity76 said he went up to @entity82 after that successful conversion and said to him : ‘ well done — you ’ve got balls as big as houses for that			2
’ that is great sportsmanship but i ’m not sure i could have done the same if i ’d seen the @entity25 ripped out of my hands			2
@entity108 , who famously went to console @entity109 at the end of an @entity112 in 2005 , joined in the debate on @entity114			2
he clearly felt i had been harsh on @entity6 and he told me cricketers applaud the opposition batsman when he passes 50 or 100 , quite often with a handshake			1
that ’s all well and good			2
but will a batsman walk up to a bowler and pat him on the back after having his stumps uprooted ? we have never seen that happen nor are we likely to			2
you do n’t congratulate the opposition at a time when your team have been put on the back foot			1
i carried that approach during my career			2
there were more talented players than me but i had desire , focus and would never lose my intensity			2
i never , for instance , ever considered shaking hands or hugging an opponent in the tunnel before a match			0
the attitude stemmed from my childhood			0
growing up as an @entity143 , i would work myself into a frenzy in the week before a derby match			1
i despised @entity62 then and i wanted the players who i supported to feel exactly the same way			0
@entity108 ( right ) consoles @entity109 after @entity56 beat @entity83 in the second @entity112 in 2005 @entity10 ( centre ) shoots and scores the opening goal on sunday at the @entity151 @entity10 celebrates his strike which helped the @entity14 to victory in the @entity12 derby if , then , i ’d seen @entity155 put an arm around @entity158 ’s shoulder after he ’d scored a goal , i ’d have been devastated			1
i took that approach when i ended up playing against @entity143			0
put it this way — i could n’t have shared a joke with @entity164 if he ’d scored 30 seconds before half - time like @entity10			1
i appreciate some people reading this will feel it was extreme but that ’s how i operated			0
@entity170 has told me regularly that if i ever want to go into coaching or management , i will have to lower my tolerance levels since modern players are different and it is n’t worth falling out with them over certain things			0
i ’m not saying my way is right or wrong but to be at my best i needed to be tense and wound up			1
if i thought to myself i needed to say ‘ well done ’ to someone i was in direct competition with , i would n’t have been thinking about winning the game in which i was involved			0
@entity183 was a manager who held similar views			0
he once saw one of our foreign players hugging an opponent in the tunnel before a game at @entity66 and went berserk afterwards			0
‘ i never want to see that again from any of you — you are going to war with them , ’ he said			0
‘ save the hugging for in the bar afterwards			0
’ @entity33 ( left ) argues with @entity170 during a 2010 league match between @entity62 and @entity9 @entity62 manager @entity183 holds the @entity198 aloft after winning the trophy in @entity200 in 2001 @entity183 even told us before the @entity198 final in 2001 that he did n’t want us looking into the stand to see our families ; given that i grew up watching players make the long walk at @entity207 while waving to the crowd , that was quite a statement			1
but do you know something ? i loved that			0
there is a time and a place for showing mutual respect and it is after the final whistle has gone and you are in the bar afterwards			0
before that , you have business to take care of and that should be the priority — that ’s why i felt so strongly about @entity6			1
others , of course , will take a different view and say i have been too harsh			0
it does n’t mean to say , though , that i can understand it			0
@entity233 need show of strength it is almost four years to the day since @entity237 struck a huge psychological blow in the battle to be top dogs in town			0
on april 16 , 2011 , @entity243 ’s goal knocked @entity244 out of the @entity198 and set his club on a path of sustained success			0
it says everything for what was achieved back then at @entity207 that @entity233 won six of the eight derbies that followed			0
even when @entity9 won the title in 2013 , there was a feeling that it was down to unrest behind the scenes with @entity258 rather than the brilliance of sir @entity261 ’s squad			1
player for player , @entity233 ’s quality was superior to their old rivals			0
@entity237 's @entity243 celebrates after scoring against @entity9 in the @entity266 semi-finals @entity267 ( centre ) lifts the trophy after @entity237 won the @entity270 in 2012 there is a similar feel about sunday ’s meeting at @entity274 but this time @entity233 are vulnerable			1
@entity9 , having won their last five @entity270 fixtures , are firm favourites and will feel confident of finally ending their neighbours ’ title aspirations			1
if @entity280 ’s side win , the ramifications for @entity233 could be serious			0
there is no doubt @entity9 will spend big again in the summer and , with the full implications of @entity285 kicking in , they might be able to recruit the players that @entity233 need			1
@entity9 will certainly fancy their chances but they should not take anything for granted			1
when the teams come out , @entity233 will still have the best striker on show in @entity293 , the best midfielder in @entity243 , the most creative talent in @entity295 and the finest defender in @entity267			0
@entity293 ( centre ) in action for @entity237 against @entity299 on monday night @entity300 ( right ) on the ball as @entity244 manager @entity280 takes training on friday that quartet have not been at their best this season but , during the last four years , they have provided the best spine in the @entity270			0
they are n’t the problem at @entity233 — it ’s the players around them who need to be improved			0
if @entity233 want to send a message to @entity9 — and for next season — @entity293 , @entity295 , @entity267 and @entity243 will have to show what we know they are capable of			1
@entity319 is starting to put his stamp on @entity9 — they have improved since the switch to 4 - 3 - 3 — and has big ambitions			1
@entity233 have relished having @entity9 in their shade			1
to keep them there , they need a show of strength .			0

@entity33 : @entity6 was wrong to congratulate @entity10
that argument from @entity34 's *columnist* has divided opinion this week
@entity33 still can not work out why the @entity9 keeper did what he did
