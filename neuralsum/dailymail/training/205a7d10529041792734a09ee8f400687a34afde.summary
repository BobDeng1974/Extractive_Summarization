by @entity0 the women of @entity2 had better watch out - hunky @entity3 is back and he 's threatening to break hearts			2
it 's been six years since the jailbird stormed out of @entity7 after a bust - up with his mum @entity9 and left for @entity10			1
now a trained hair stylist , @entity3 will be opening a trendy salon , which actor @entity13 cheekily reveals is just another way for his character to cosy up to the local ladies			1
' @entity3 uses his job to get close to women , ' @entity13 says with a grin			1
' he likes plenty of eye candy to check out , so he 's quite enjoy - ing being back			2
he offers them a shoulder to cry on and then gets them into bed ... which is what @entity3 's all about			2
' @entity13 's character @entity3 will be opening a trendy hair salon in the square no change there then			1
in his last spell in @entity34 , from 2006 - 8 , he bedded @entity35 and made a beeline for glamourpusses @entity37 and @entity39			1
@entity13 's own love life has made headlines too			1
in 2007 his @entity42 partner @entity43 chose @entity13 over her long - term lover @entity44 , and then a year later she split with @entity13 to be with @entity46 actor @entity45 , who she 's since married			1
@entity13 as @entity3 in @entity34 back in 2007 @entity13 's now single and keen to meet someone special			1
' but , ' he adds , ' @entity48 's pretty crazy , so i find it hard even to see my friends			1
' while @entity3 has returned to the @entity7 to see his grandad @entity51 , @entity13 was persuaded back by the exciting plans of new executive producer @entity53 , who 's bringing @entity7 up to date to reflect modern - day @entity54			1
a new set is also being built that will be 20 per cent bigger , meaning there 'll be more scope for filming in new locations			2
' i 'd just finished filming a historical drama called @entity62 when i got a call from @entity53 , ' explains @entity13 , 27 , who has appeared in hit @entity66 series @entity64 and several plays since leaving @entity34			1
' his enthusiasm hit me and made me consider a return			2
@entity70 's young himself and wants to bring in that young , modern element , which i like			0
i think it 's a good thing for the show as they start to make it reflect the vibrant @entity54 in 2014			2
' @entity13 's last stint on the show ended with the ' shock ' of his contract not being renewed			1
looking back , he says it was just the nudge he needed			0
' @entity34 was an apprenticeship - i was 18 , it was my first job and i learned a lot			1
i do n't think i did all that well my first time there			0
i was a teenager and just blagging it			0
working on other things has made me a better , more rounded and experienced actor , ' he insists			0
' i 've worked alongside some great people , and that really helps you learn			0
i 've been lucky with the way things have gone			0
' it remains to be seen if @entity2 's women will feel the same way			0
cats or dogs ? i live with my brother and we bought a cockapoo , @entity101 , which we worry about like a baby ! @entity103 or live music ? i enjoy a beer with friends while watching a live band with good songs to sing along to – i like @entity109 and the @entity110 or @entity111 ? @entity112 is awesome			0
he ’s got a stillness i could watch for hours			0
