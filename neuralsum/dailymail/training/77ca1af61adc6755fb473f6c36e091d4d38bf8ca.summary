a long journey across the @entity2 ocean to play a regular - season game in @entity4 not something that many @entity7 players experience , but it is a trip that @entity8 is getting very used to			1
@entity8 played at the @entity9 two years ago when the @entity10 beat the @entity11 and then returned 12 months later as coach of a @entity14 team that was far too strong for the @entity15			1
on thursday night , @entity8 will once again return to the same building as coach of the @entity18 as they face his former team the @entity10			1
@entity8 has assembled a young and exciting team at the @entity18 this season coming to @entity4 in the middle of the season is a trip that @entity8 enjoys , and his previous two experiences stand him in good stead to rack up a hat - trick of regular - season victories in @entity29			1
‘ wherever i ’m at we get signed up for this game , @entity8 laughed			2
‘ i love it and the last two years it has been great and i look forward to it again			0
‘ being a player the first year , i understand the schedule that we had			0
i used it the following year for @entity14 and i thought it helped us adjust to the time zone and also adjust to having practice when the time difference is big			2
‘ we will copy the same things we did last year and hopefully try and find a way to win			0
’ since his move from @entity14 in the summer , @entity8 has created a young and exciting team in @entity18 that travel to @entity4 with a winning 20 - 19 record and fifth place in the @entity49			1
the @entity18 have beaten the @entity10 both times they have played this season , including earlier this month when the contest against the @entity10 in @entity4 was announced last year by the @entity7 , the @entity18 were something of an unknown quantity and a mere supporting act to one of the league ’s most popular teams			1
but with the talent that @entity8 has assembled in @entity18 , along with the @entity10 ’ struggles this season , the @entity18 are a team that are going places and they will be favourites to win on thursday			1
‘ we ca n’t take anybody lightly , @entity8 said			2
‘ there is nobody in this league that we can overlook			0
@entity69 ( @entity68 , @entity10 head coach ) is going to have his guys ready to play and they have got a lot of talent so we will definitely bring our a-game			2
‘ we are not built around one guy			0
we have some very young talent , but when you look at the pieces we have with guys who play at a very high level , we are still the second youngest team in the league and we are fun to watch			2
the @entity18 travelled to @entity4 with a 20 - 19 record and in fifth place in the @entity49 ‘ i would n’t want to be in no other place than with a young team being able to grow as a young coach so i ’m in a perfect environment and love the city of @entity18 – it ’s been great			1
‘ this is a close team already so being able to do team functions and something different always gives the experience , win or lose , of understanding what we can learn from doing something that is n’t just the norm			0
‘ we always try and talk about the future but we have got to stay in the present and my job is to make these guys understand what it takes to win and what it means to play hard and also what it means to do your job to a very high level			0
’ @entity8 is only in his second season as an @entity7 head coach after almost two decades as a player , but already he has been through a lot			1
@entity8 played for the @entity10 in their win over the @entity11 at the @entity9 in january 2013 @entity8 returned to @entity4 last year to coach the @entity14 to victory over the @entity15 his start in @entity14 last season was n’t the best , but eventually he got his team in order for a play - off run before being traded to @entity18			1
his opposite number at @entity124 , @entity68 , is going through a similarly rough spell in his rookie season as a coach with the @entity10 on a 15 - game losing streak and holding a 5 - 35 record			1
‘ coaching is different to playing , ’ @entity8 said			1
‘ it is n’t always going to start off great but this is a marathon and it is how you end			0
coach @entity68 is going through a tough time right now , but there is still a lot of basketball to be played and a lot of games to turnaround and they have the talent			0
' @entity8 grew up in @entity144 and initially started playing football			2
two years ago , the former @entity10 point guard joined some of his team - mates in watching @entity149 play @entity150 in the @entity151 at @entity152 the day before their game against the @entity11			1
‘ as a kid it was my first sport and it was great to see soccer become a little more popular here in the @entity159 , ' @entity8 said			0
‘ but it is great to see those athletes and what they do and the fans who sing songs			0
the enthusiasm of going to a game is incredible			0
