by @entity0 published : 02:54 est , 14 august 2013 updated : 04:47 est , 14 august 2013 a doctor wrongly told three patients they had the all - clear from breast cancer after they underwent tests			1
a total of 462 male and female patients had a series of examinations before being told they were given the all clear			1
it was only when two consultants spotted that a doctor was not screening patients correctly that the mistakes were realised			2
the @entity16 had to send letters to 462 people asking them to be re-examined the @entity16 had to send patients who were examined between january 2011 and july 2012 letters telling them they needed to undergo tests again			1
after being re-examined a 63 - year - old man was diagnosed with the disease and two women had already been told they had cancer and were being treated at a different hospital			1
the doctor no longer works at the hospital			2
consultants who run the breast clinic raised concerns regarding a doctor a hospital spokesman : ' earlier this year the @entity35 invited back a number of patients who attended the breast clinic at the @entity16 between january 2011 and july 2012			1
' this was because the consultants who run the breast clinic raised concerns regarding a doctor , who is no longer working in the @entity35			1
' we carried out a careful review of the management of the patients who were seen by this doctor and invited 462 patients back for a clinical appointment with a consultant			2
' of those invited back , one has been diagnosed with breast cancer			0
' two other patients had been treated for breast cancer at other hospitals in the interval period between when they were originally seen by the doctor , and when they were invited back			2
' we apologise to all patients involved for the distress this has caused			0
' the review team worked extremely hard to ensure all patients invited back did receive the invite letter			0
' copies of the letters were sent to the patient â€™s gps and new addresses were found for those who did not respond with offers of appointments closer to where they now live			0
' a helpline was set up for patients and extra clinics put on for those patients who could not make the earlier appointments			0
' some patients chose not to attend after discussions with clinical staff and for individual reasons a few patients are still coming in for appointments			0
' the @entity83 will continue to look closely at this case and we have invited the @entity86 in to review what happened			0
