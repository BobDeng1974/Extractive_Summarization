by @entity0 published : 11:16 est , 21 july 2012 updated : 13:32 est , 21 july 2012 with just six days to go until the launch of the @entity4 most of us are still none the wiser about what the spectacular opening ceremony will consist of			1
but a new 17 second - long video clip on @entity8 has nevertheless given a tantalising glimpse of some of the ten thousand volunteers being put through their paces - from a group of dancers practicing their moves to an orchestra rehearsing			1
the video , released by the organisers , shows a variety of intriguing scenes in quick succession , including what looks like molten metal being poured from a kiln , to a canon being fired and part of a spectacular fireworks display			1
preparations for the three - hour opening ceremony are in full swing , with the 10,000 volunteer performers now attending thrice - weekly rehearsals			1
if any of them miss a single rehearsal , they are told not to come back			2
@entity60 , who directed @entity61 , is in creative charge , and as recent pictures of the scenes inside the stadium reveal , the show will essentially tell the story of the making of @entity69 — culturally , socially and politically			2
coordinating the thousands of volunteers taking part has been a mammoth task cheers ! volunteers , including @entity75 , 30 , from @entity76 , east @entity77 , make some noise during a rehearsal a violinist practices alongside other members of the orchestra that will play at the opening ceremony a performer is descended from safety wires as she practices her moves organisers have flouted the usual 7.30pm start because they require dark for fireworks			1
the finish is expected to be after midnight			2
the artistic part of the opening ceremony has had to be cut short by 30 minutes to ensure that spectators leave on time			1
at least 100 @entity96 competitors wo n’t march in the parade because they ’ll be competing next morning			0
and the 75 - strong track and field team , including @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 , will be in @entity102 at a preparation camp , as their events start in the second week of the @entity105			0
@entity107 cheerleaders have also been practicing their dance routines - pictured here at the beach volleyball training courts at @entity110 in central @entity77 the main stadium will be transformed into a meadow , with real grass laid over the infield and a game of cricket unfolding in one corner			1
at one end there will be a replica of @entity121 , the ancient site in @entity122 which is linked to @entity124 legend			0
in front of the @entity126 will be a mosh - pit , to replicate the dance area in front of the stage at the @entity131			0
here , up to 100 members of the public who have bought tickets will be allowed to stand			0
gents : dressed in a way which has been deemed to represent @entity69 , performers prepare for the rehearsals at the @entity36 in @entity139 the @entity36 is being prepared for the opening ceremony taking place in less than a week a river runs through it : the @entity144 takes centre stage for the @entity107 opening ceremony seen in this aerial shot of the ceremony preparations at the other end of the stadium , beneath a giant bell , will be the ‘ posh - pit ’ — so named by @entity60 because the public there will be reflecting the spirit of promenaders at @entity156			1
there will also be four giant @entity159 representing @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163			0
the green will give way to an industrial landscape with models of @entity168 , the @entity169 of @entity170 and the @entity171 which have been built at a site in @entity173			0
performers will recreate the @entity176 march of 1936 , when 200 men walked to @entity77 to protest about unemployment and poverty in the @entity180			2
the @entity181 will be honoured by real nurses pushing hospital beds around the arena , and there will also be a tribute to the suffragette movement			0
performers will also pay homage to @entity189			2
