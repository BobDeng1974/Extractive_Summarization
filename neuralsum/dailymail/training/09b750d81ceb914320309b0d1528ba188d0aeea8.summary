by @entity0 @entity1 looks set to be extended into the @entity2 after the scheme to expand a 1.3 mile stretch of land was ruled financially feasible			1
the proposal , released last month , was dubbed @entity7 and could be built alongside a levee scheme aimed at offering protection from storm surges such as the one caused by @entity11			1
the expansion could provide two new city blocks as well as open space and according to documents is ' technically , legally and financially feasible			1
' an artist 's impression of @entity7 , which could be built on a multi-purpose levee to protect @entity1 from storm surges an artist 's impression of how the @entity22 which will protect the lower east side of @entity1 from storm surges could look it is hoped that one of the benefits of creating both residential and commercial developments would help offset the construction costs that would run into billions of dollars and even fund additional resiliency programmes			1
during @entity11 in 2012 , the shoreline of the @entity2 rose to 19 feet above sea level highlighting the city 's vulnerability to coastal flooding and storm surges			1
last year , another report first floated the idea of a ' multi-purpose levee ' to protect the city from extreme weather			1
@entity41 , director of @entity43 's @entity42 said : ' if we do n't make something like this happen , we are totally exposed to the risk of climate change			0
the area near to the @entity50 , which could be reclaimed and transformed into what has been dubbed ' @entity7 ' ' we ’re putting big , bold ideas out there because traditional solutions are going to prove ineffective			1
this is a feasible way to protect the city			1
' multi-purpose levees have been successfully implemented in flood - prone areas in the @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61			0
they are usually built in areas of particularly high vulnerabilities due to high population densities , concentration of economic activity , and the location of critical infrastructure systems			0
it appears that the levee will run along the @entity2 from @entity2 13th street to @entity72 , just south of the @entity50			1
a map showing how the island of @entity1 has expanded outwards from 1650 to 1980 building on reclaimed land in @entity1 has been taking place since the 17th century when it was still known as @entity78			2
the first expansion took place in 1646 under @entity81 , who took over as the governor of @entity78 colony when the island of @entity1 was expanded between one and four blocks on each side			2
but it was not until the 20th century that @entity1 's geography underwent a dramatic transformation			2
in 1934 , construction began on the @entity90 ( known now as the @entity90 ) , expanding @entity1 to the east			2
running 9.5 miles from @entity1 's battery to the @entity94 , the highway is built on a combination of landfill and pile - supported relieving platforms			2
@entity1 pictured in 1934 , while construction began on the @entity90 , now known as @entity90 , which expanded @entity1 to the east by 1976 , @entity1 had expanded an additional 23.5 acres with the creation of @entity100 along the @entity101 , with 1.2 million cubic yards of earth and rock excavated for the @entity104 as its foundation			2
the area became home to an upscale residential neighborhood with great schools and parks not far from @entity43 's @entity7 bustling financial district , but the close proximity to the water has left that part of @entity1 prone to flooding			1
now , @entity43 has 400,000 people and 68,000 buildings inside the flood plain			0
the bridging berm will effectively raise the riverbank to nine feet above current level , which is more than four feet above @entity11 ’s high - water mark			0
predicted timelines on how long the project will take to complete range from five to 35 years but the city has already started to consult with the local community on plans			0
@entity1 has been subject to a series of land reclamations , the first of which took place in 1646 when the island expanded between one and four blocks on each side			2
the berm will also provide better access to the park , left , which is largely cut off from the neighbourhood by the highway however , it was @entity1 's violent encounter with @entity11 , which overwhelmed the streets with water and plunged most of the area into darkness , that made local residents , business owners and city officials realise how truly vulnerable that reclaimed land was			1
in 2000 , the @entity153 announced plans to build a 400 foot tall building south of the @entity156 near to @entity100 on the @entity2 waterfront			0
however , two years later it was revealed the project had been cancelled as foundation director @entity160 acknowledged the prospect of finding the $ 950million funding was unrealistic			0
a model of the @entity164 , which was planned for the @entity2 but was dropped as the @entity153 said it was unrealistic to find the $ 950million needed to finance the project in november 2000 , the @entity153 announced plans to develop piers and build a 400 - foot tall building south of the @entity156 on reclaimed land in @entity1			1
the foundation were said to have pledged $ 67.8 million towards the project , which was to include a new @entity164 designed by @entity160			0
mr @entity160 designed @entity172 's museum in @entity173 and crowds were drawn to view the plans at the @entity43 museum on @entity177			0
the plans showed it would have had 200,000 square feet of exhibition space , a theatre and a centre for arts education as well as six acres of open space			0
it would have been built on connecting platforms extending from old slip to @entity188			0
however , just two years later the plans were dropped from a report released by city mayor @entity191 called ' @entity43 's @entity192 '			0
@entity153 director @entity193 acknowledged that the $ 950million needed to finance the project would be unrealistic to find			0
in a statement at the time he said : ' the @entity172 project has to be rethought , perhaps on a more modest level , and certainly in the context of the city 's master plan for the development of @entity1			1

plan to expand @entity1 by 500 feet *deemed* ' financially feasible '
proposal dubbed ' @entity7 ' and could provide two new city blocks
could be built alongside a levee scheme to protect area from flooding
appears it will run from @entity2 13th street to @entity72
