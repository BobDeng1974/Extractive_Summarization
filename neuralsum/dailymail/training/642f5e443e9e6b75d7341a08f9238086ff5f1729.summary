by @entity1 reporter published : 05:12 est , 25 june 2012 updated : 05:12 est , 25 june 2012 a woman desperate to become a mother died after a surgeon cut open her bowel during a procedure aimed at helping her to have children			1
the slit went unnoticed by medics at @entity11 and @entity12 died at her home in @entity14 , just over two days later			2
the 39 - year - old had fatally inhaled vomit after becoming sick with bile seeping from the cut , an inquest heard			1
@entity12 married @entity20 in 2010			2
they had both longed for children and discussed baby names paramedics found mrs @entity12 in bed , not breathing and without a pulse			1
they confirmed she died at just before 1am on june 23 last year			2
her distraught husband , 30 - year - old trainee security guard @entity20 , said after the hearing at @entity30 : ' i was missing someone call me ‘ dad ’ and she was missing someone call her ‘ mum ’ - those were our dreams			2
' mr @entity38 , added : ' we argued about having a son - i wanted to call him @entity41 and she wanted to call him @entity43			2
' i wanted blue eyes and she wanted brown eyes			0
we were n’t bad people , why did this happen to her ? ' the couple met in mr @entity38 ’s native @entity52 in 2006			0
he was a barman at the @entity54 hotel where @entity12 was staying on holiday			0
they married there two years later , before moving to @entity58 in 2010			0
however , after unsuccessfully trying for children the following year , @entity61 warehouse worker @entity59 - born mrs @entity12 was referred to the women ’s hospital			1
surgeons carried out a laparoscopy on june 20 last year , which is a minimally invasive procedure to explore her abdomen and pelvis			1
medics said they could ' see nothing wrong ' after the procedure			0
grieving : ' we weren ¿ t bad people , why did this happen to her ? ' mr @entity71 asked @entity77 dr @entity76 , who carried out the post-mortem examination , said he discovered a gynaecological procedure carried out in the @entity59 ' several years ' earlier had resulted in mrs @entity81 ’s bowel fusing with abdominal wall scar tissue			1
this , he said , meant the usually free - moving organ was n’t pushed away as the surgeon cut into mrs @entity81			1
women ’s hospital consultant obstetrician dr @entity87 later told the hearing an internal investigation had cleared the surgeon of any wrongdoing and up to three in every 1,000 patients who had the procedure suffered such an abdominal perforation			0
coroner @entity97 ruled mrs @entity12 died following elective surgery			1
he said : ' this does not mean that anybody did anything wrong , nor does it mean they did n’t do anything wrong			0
' he added : ' the surgery caused a small perforation in her bowel			1
that perforation later leaked and caused an infection			0
that infection made her very ill. ' just that illness alone could and would have caused her death , but she actually died because while she was so very ill , some of her gastric contents came up and went into her lungs			0
' in a statement , women ’s hospital @entity119 chief executive dr @entity118 said : ' the trust was saddened to hear of the death of mrs @entity81			1
a thorough investigation was launched and , while no problems were found with the medical care provided , we took the opportunity to review and improve communications with patients following surgery			0
