a great white shark with razor - sharp teeth continues to close in on @entity2 , tracking technology can reveal			1
the deadly predator – named @entity5 – is just 780 miles ( 1,255km ) off the coast of @entity7 and @entity8 in the @entity9			1
the 14.5ft ( 4.5metres ) , 2,000lb ( 907kg ) fish has also become the first tagged great white shark to cross the @entity13 , as it journeys closer to the @entity2 and @entity14			1
it is not understood why she is moving in such a northerly direction last week it was predicted that the shark would arrive in @entity2 waters today , but @entity5 took a detour which has also makes her the most northerly tagged great white shark ever tracked too			1
the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) is a ridge found along the floor of the @entity9			1
this rift marks the actual boundary between adjacent tectonic plates , where magma from the mantle reaches the seafloor , erupting as lava and producing new crustal material for the plates			0
it forms part of the longest mountain range in the world and separates the @entity39 and @entity40 in the @entity9 , and the @entity41 from the @entity42 in the @entity9			0
she was tagged as part of the @entity46 project , which aims to monitor sharks to learn more about their movements			2
@entity5 ’s progress can be followed on the project ’s website			2
scientists have been following the ferocious fish for over a year as part of a ground - breaking ocean life study			2
@entity5 has swum 248 miles ( 400km ) in the last 72 hours and is currently less than 800 miles ( 1,288km ) away from @entity2			1
record breaker : the deadly predator has also become the first tagged shark of its species to cross the @entity13 , an enormous underwater mountain range under the ocean deadly cargo : tagging the shark ( pictured ) was a feat in itself , with heavy machinery used to hoist @entity5 from the water in order to fit the tracking device she has become the first tagged great white to cross the @entity13 - an underwater mountain range which separates the @entity39 and @entity40 tectonic plates - on the morning of march 9			1
great whites are traditionally tracked off the coasts of @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , the west coast of @entity80 from @entity81 up to @entity82 , the @entity83 and @entity84			1
shark biologist @entity85 tweeted : ‘ @entity5 pinged in on the other side of @entity94 ! welcome to the history books , # @entity5 , ’ while @entity86 , who is involved in the project , tweeted : ' # @entity5 turns @entity88 toward # @entity2 continuing first doc @entity91 migration n hist ! ’ she has covered more than 19,400 miles since a tracking device was fitted to her near @entity97 as part of the @entity46 scientific project and can reach speeds of 35mph			1
scientists said they are shocked by her recent dash towards @entity103			0
it is impossible to predict which way @entity5 will travel , but she is currently pointing in the direction of @entity8 and the @entity2 , having journeyed further north			1
@entity5 has become the first tagged great white to cross the @entity13 ( pictured ) - an underwater mountain range which separates the @entity39 and @entity109 - at around 10am on march 9 ‘ i have no idea what to expect from her next			1
i 've been working with sharks for a very long time now and i have never seen anything like this , ’ said dr @entity113 , 52 , senior fisheries biologist with @entity114			0
‘ it 's anyone 's guess where she is going to go next but she has been heading east so she might continue to do so			0
‘ in the last day we 've had quite a few recordings after a little break			0
this is probably because she 's starting to come a little higher up , where the water is warmer			2
‘ though it 's hard to predict what she 'll do it 'll be very exciting if she comes to you guys			0
@entity5 was tagged by the @entity46 project , which aims to monitor sharks to learn more about their movements ‘ she 's just short of 800 miles away from your coast now but in the grand scheme of things that really is n't far for her			1
it 's all very exciting			0
‘ it 's hard to say how long it might take her to get there			0
if she decides she wants to get to @entity147 she could get there in days			0
‘ having said that , she is quite likely to meander			0
it could take her days , it could take her months , or it might not happen at all			0
‘ i think it would be great to see her turn up in the @entity2 though			1
’ @entity5 ’s tag only gives her location when she nears the surface and the mighty shark left researchers anxious for days before providing an update , as she remained deep in the water			2
the act of tagging the shark , let alone predicting where it will travel , was a feat in itself			0
a 75,000lb hydraulic platform was used to hoist @entity5 from the water in order to fit the tracking device			2
though @entity5 's journey is impressive , great whites are known for their marathon migrations			1
in 2003 a great white nicknamed @entity172 travelled from @entity76 to @entity77 and back - a some 12,400 miles			1
in recent years there have been several sightings of great whites off the coast of @entity2			1
in september last year , fisherman @entity176 said he had spotted a 14ft beast swimming close to his boat off the coast of @entity180 in southern @entity7			1
the suspected sighting came just a day after a fisherman on board a lobster boat said he spotted a ' giant shark ' get close to his vessel			2
all those who witnessed the shark dismissed the idea it could be a basking shark , saying the creature was much larger , prompting experts to consider the possibility it was a great white			1
great white sharks are the largest predatory fish in the world , reaching up to 20ft in length and more than 4,400lb in weight			1
satellite tracking of the giant species has afforded researchers and scientists more accurate information about their habits and long - distance journeys			2
the @entity207 has tagged around 100 sharks since 2009			2
the study has shown that great whites can travel up to 3,000 miles in three months			1
they are traditionally tracked off the coasts of @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , the west coast of @entity80 from @entity81 up to @entity82 , the @entity83 and @entity84			0
the creatures have a ferocious reputation but are responsible for between a third and a half of the average 100 shark attacks across the world each year			0
they are highly adapted predators , detecting a single drop of blood in 100 litres of water up to three miles away			2
their mouths are lined with around 300 serrated teeth , arranged across several rows			0
gathering speed and approaching their prey from beneath , great whites can leap clear of the water , breaching like whales to attack			1
they commonly feed on sea lions , seals , small toothed whales , and sea turtles			0
the predators live for up to 25 years and eat around 11 tonnes of food each year			0
if food is scarce , the sharks will try to avoid fighting , instead engaging in a tail - slapping contest along the surface of the water			0
the winner delivers the most slaps			0
scientists do not have a reliable idea of the species ' population across the world , but agree their number are decreasing due to overfishing and sharks being caught accidentally in nets			0
they are listed as an endangered species .			0

on *friday* , @entity5 was spotted 1,000 miles from @entity7 and @entity8
the satellite - tagged 15ft , 2,000lb great white is now just 780 miles away after she crossed the @entity13 found in the middle of the ocean
it was predicted that she could arrive in @entity2 waters today , but @entity5 took a detour north , which also makes her the most northerly tagged great white
no one understands why she is taking such a *strange* route as great whites are usually found in warmer waters
