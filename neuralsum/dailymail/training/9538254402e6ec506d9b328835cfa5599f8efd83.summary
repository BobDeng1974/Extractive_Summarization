by @entity0 published : 03:52 est , 12 november 2013 updated : 04:29 est , 12 november 2013 changes : planes like these landing at @entity4 will be banned from landing or taking off after 11pm from 2017 the noisiest planes at @entity8 ’s biggest airports will have to take off and land half an hour earlier under an extended night - time flying ban , the government has revealed			1
in future they will be stopped from flying in and out of @entity13 , @entity4 and @entity15 airports after 11pm , 30 minutes before the current deadline			1
the noisiest planes are already banned between 11.30pm and 7am at large airports and these current night flying rules will remain in place until october 2017			1
ministers say it is ‘ sensible ’ not to make major changes before the government - appointed @entity24 to report in summer 2015 with its plans for future expansion			2
‘ as noise impacts are a key consideration for the commission , we agree that it would not be sensible to make any significant changes to the current regime before the commission has completed its work and the government has had time to consider its recommendations , ' aviation minister @entity29 said			0
‘ we therefore propose to set a three year regime to last until october 2017 which will retain the main features of the current regime , in particular the numbers of movements and noise quota permitted			2
’ the details were published in a second consultation into night - flying , which revealed ' some minor changes will be made to restrict the noisiest aircraft			2
dangerous : certain studies have revealed the negative impact plane noise can have on the health of households under flight paths named and shamed : last week @entity13 revealed their first ever league table of airline noise based on summer readings , with @entity61 's @entity60 and @entity63 's @entity62 the worst offenders ' we are proposing to extend the operational ban on the noisiest types of aircraft to include the 11pm to 11.30pm period			1
such aircraft are already banned in the rest of the night period ( 11.30pm to 7am ) , ' it says			1
’ whilst there are few such movements , this change would prevent sleep disturbance caused by movements of these noisier aircraft types at this time			0
‘ these proposals will maintain the current level of protection for local communities , provide stability until decisions have been made about any new airport capacity			0
’ ministers have also encouraged trials of planes making steeper descents into airports to reduce the noise ‘ footprint ’ and therefore the number of households affected			0
but the report stresses : ’ the government has been restricting night flights for many years at @entity13 , @entity4 and @entity15 in order to limit the impact of night noise on local residents			1
’ @entity104 ’s shadow aviation minister @entity103 mp said : ’ i welcome the government ’s proposals not to increase the number of night time flights at these airports			2
‘ we believe this issue is one that the @entity113 will want to take proper account of in both its interim and final reports			0
but @entity107 must not become complacent about this issue			0
instead they must carefully monitor the situation and respond to the concerns coming out of local communities while prioritising future strategies to control noise			0

*latest* landing or take - off will now be 11pm instead of 11.30pm
changes at @entity13 , @entity4 and @entity15 will be brought in from 2017
night flying at certain airports is already banned between 11.30pm and 7am
