the sovereign state of @entity1 , perched on the north coast of @entity3 , is described as the ' forgotten jewel of @entity5 '			1
it certainly was when i visited 30 - odd years ago and was dropped by helicopter on to an unexplored ridge			1
back then , at the age of 20 , i was almost overcome by the primeval beauty of it all - particularly the lilting gibbon calls at dawn and range after range of majestic trees			1
anyway , it was about time i went back to see how the little sultanate had fared - after all , the bulk of @entity3 ( the rest comprises @entity23 , the @entity25 portion of the island , and the two @entity28 states of @entity29 and @entity30 ) had , in the ensuing years , been widely abused , if not clear - felled			1
heading back : @entity31 first visited @entity1 30 years ago - and was delighted to return to its rainforest i was bracing myself			1
the country 's vast oil reserves have led to it becoming one of the richest per capita on the planet , in sixth place			1
@entity40 comes in at only 22nd			1
sure enough , things had changed			1
@entity42 , the capital , was no longer a backwater but a sleek , clean place of breathtaking mosques and balmy avenues			2
it says something about 21st century @entity1 that my guide , @entity50 , suggested i might like to experience - after a leisurely dusk river trip - the ' @entity53 bike evening tour '			1
on our river trip , a boat whisked us into tranquil waterways , abode of salt - water crocodiles , flying foxes and monitor lizards			2
the sun dipped serenely over the mangroves while proboscis monkeys munched on leaves , kingfishers dipped , and egrets returned to their roosts			2
then it was back to my gloriously immodest accommodation , the mighty @entity72 and @entity71			2
this featured a luxurious manmade beach - next to a luxurious natural beach			2
it was hard to imagine going anywhere more lavish - though we managed it at the @entity80 , whose gate railings are capped with 18 - carat gold , sapphires and rubies			2
everything you see turns to gold : @entity1 's wealth is visible in the ornateness of some of its buildings , including its mosques ( left ) ; the @entity93 ( right ) , who holds aopen - house event for his people every year next up was the @entity99 , the royal palace			1
my visit coincided with the annual festival of @entity104 , when the @entity105 extends a personal greeting to his people			2
it 's the ultimate open - house party at the world 's largest residential palace , which , at the last count , had 1,888 rooms and 290 bathrooms			1
i joined the throng of scrupulously turned out families to be conducted through ever grander halls			0
finally , the 29th sultan , @entity116 , the richest man in the world , was before us , there to shake hands with each male subject			1
in an adjoining chamber his consort greeted the women			0
the @entity105 and his family greeted 73,000 visitors during the two - day festival			0
but i had come here for the jungle - encouraged by reports that 97 per cent of the primary forest was still pristine			0
so it was off into the @entity132 by longboat into the emerald interior			0
after a couple of hours we came upon the @entity137 - a peaceful retreat among the soaring trees with well appointed cabins constructed along a boardwalk			0
this means that without actually having to step into the vegetation , you may peer at frogs with sucker feet , observe a pygmy squirrel , or prod one of those engaging crickets that resemble a fallen leaf			0
we went off on a forest trek , which was utterly enchanting : a giant lizard striped like a zebra splayed itself on a stone ; a bat snoozed under a leaf			0
then the horned frog uttered its cry - the signal for a downpour - and we retreated			0
monkey business : @entity31 spotted proboscis monkeys and giant lizards in the rainforests of @entity1 but the highlight was the misty dawn - and those gibbons with their eerie early morning call			1
at @entity132 the effect is magnified by a discreet walkway lately constructed right above the tree canopy			0
what a sight - spectacular and stirring			0
the forests here had endured			0
i do n't think any visitor could forget that rather private experience of seeing the sun rise through an endless kingdom of orchid - laden trees			0
that , i thought to myself as we took the longboat downriver , is what travel is about : gathering what secret jewels we may along the way			0
