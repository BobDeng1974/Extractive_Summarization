booze borough : a pub in @entity4 , a city where 36 people drank themselves to death in 2010 @entity26 , where 27 died , was the only voting district in the south to register among these hotspots , according to data from the @entity31			1

they ’re dying because alcohol is available on nearly every street corner at all hours of the day and night			0
they ’re dying because alcohol is also far too heavily promoted			0
‘ the alcohol industry spends something like £ 800m a year on marketing which is having a huge impact on recruiting the next generation of problem drinkers from amongst our children			1
