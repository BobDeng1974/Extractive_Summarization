keep dancing : sir @entity0 and his third wife @entity1 as he celebrates his 87th birthday tomorrow , sir @entity2 will treat himself to a @entity4 , a refreshing mix of champagne and cranberry juice			1
‘ it ’s delicious , ’ he said			2
‘ i ’ve never been a massive drinker , but it ’s lovely			2
’ mixing his food groups is usually a no - no for the @entity14 host , however			2
he is an ardent follower of the @entity16 diet , which advises against mixing proteins with carbohydrates			1
indeed , he credits his longevity to his healthy eating regime , lots of exercise and the enduring love of his third wife @entity1 , to whom he has been married for almost 32 years			1
a weekly massage and a handful of vitamin d , @entity28 and @entity29 supplements each day have also helped sir @entity0 to maintain his stamina			1
lifting the lid on his maintenance regime , he said : ‘ i never miss taking my supplements and i regard massage as a medicine			2
‘ i have a masseuse called @entity37 who comes to the house			2
i do the @entity16 diet where i do n’t have potatoes with meat or fish and i drink lots of water			1
’ sir @entity0 , who has enjoyed a seven - decade career , does , however , admit to some vices			1
i ca n’t go a day without chocolate			0
@entity50 and @entity51 and @entity53 chocolate			0
i do have a few squares a day , ’ he said			0
despite retiring from hosting @entity56 , the veteran entertainer has no intention of slowing down – with performances of his one - man show planned for across @entity60 in the coming weeks			0

’ the @entity16 diet is based on the principle of segregating certain food types , such as not mixing proteins with carbohydrates and having three regular meals a day			1
it was created in the 1920s by @entity75 physician @entity16 after he developed a life - threatening kidney disease			1
modern - day fans include actresses @entity78 and @entity80			0
the science underpinning the diet has been called ‘ unfounded ’ by experts because it ignores the fact that carbohydrate - rich foods contain significant amounts of protein			2
sir @entity0 is currently enjoying himself in @entity88 , where he spends four months of the year with @entity1			1
he said of his birthday : ‘ to celebrate i am hoping to do what i did last year and that is to have a game of golf in the morning outside in the lovely 80 degree heat			0
‘ then i will have lunch in a hotel in @entity97 with some friends , which of course would not be complete without @entity0 ’s @entity4			1
' in fact i think we will let the @entity4 loose ! you put about an inch of cranberry into a glass – you must always do that first – and then you pour champagne over it			0
