by @entity0 his mother is famous for her chic sense of style , while his @entity5 is no stranger to making fashion headlines of her own			0

@entity16 , who exchanged an air kiss with the @entity18 as she arrived at the @entity19 at @entity20 , looked wonderful in an all - cream ensemble , complete with a cosy bouclé coat and a multi-strand pearl necklace			1
perfectly - groomed @entity27 , who smiled broadly as she arrived for the intimate ceremony accompanied by husband @entity44 and children @entity5 and @entity46 , teamed her coat with a soft grey satin trimmed straw hat by milliner @entity50			1
both grandmothers plumped for comfortable low - heeled leather court shoes that kept attention firmly on their outfits , the pair joined the @entity56 , who looked elegant in a cream ruffled suit by @entity59 and a £ 755 bespoke @entity61 hat , and other members of the royal family including @entity64 and the @entity18 , for the event , which was attended by just 22 people			1
but although it was @entity9 's big day , all eyes were on his grandmothers - both of whom have raised their style game in recent years			0
@entity16 's understated , regal style has been finessed since her 2005 wedding to @entity32 , with designers such as @entity76 and @entity77 taking pride of place in her wardrobe			0

the majority of the duchess ' hats are bespoke and the work of some of the @entity116 's biggest millinery names , among them @entity117 and @entity118 , who also makes hats for her nieces @entity120 and @entity122			0
by contrast , @entity35 shares her eldest daughter 's thrifty approach to fashion with much of her wardrobe purchased on the high street			2
like her daughters @entity56 and @entity5 , @entity27 has a penchant for @entity131 and @entity132 , but is known to splash out on occasion			0
at the 2011 royal wedding , @entity27 plumped for @entity39 , who also designed her ensemble for the christening of @entity9 , and chose a flattering @entity138 tea dress for her first meeting with her grandson at the @entity141 in june			1
