by @entity0 for @entity1 today , 20,000 rugby fans from 127 countries will cheer them on to victory at the @entity7 stadium in @entity8			0
no , we 're not talking about @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 , but a plumber , special needs teacher and youth manager who spend their free time playing for the @entity19 women 's rugby team			1
while little is known about these incredibly committed women , they , unlike the aforementioned men 's team , juggle day jobs with their sporting commitments			1
challenge : today will see the women 's @entity19 team , pictured with men 's captain @entity11 , take on @entity30 in the @entity32 final at the @entity7 stadium in @entity8 today , their profile is set to sky - rocket as they take on @entity30 in their fourth successive @entity32 final - and they 're feeling confident			1
with a half - century of @entity39 appearances already , the next grand ambition is a collective one			0
@entity19 suffered an agonisingly narrow defeat in the home @entity32 final four years ago to finish as runners - up to @entity44 for the third consecutive tournament but @entity47 ’s squad are hell - bent on making it fourth time lucky			1
game face : today will see the likes of @entity51 , pictured , take on @entity30 in the @entity32 final - and the team are feeling confident ' i remember the 2002 @entity32 when there was barely any recognition			1
you would n't have known a @entity32 was going on			1
but this year the support we 're getting and the recognition the sport is getting is amazing , the viewing figures just keep going up and it 's just looking really good for the sport and for women in the sport , ' @entity57 , 24 , from @entity58 told @entity67			1
@entity57 , a flanker , works full - time as a plumber and while she admits juggling the two commitments is ' a bit tricky ' , she 's lucky because her employer is very good to her			1
joining her on the pitch is @entity74			0
the 30 - year - old flanker , along with @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 , is an ambassador for the men 's @entity79 2015 and works as a manager at @entity82 in the week			1
@entity83 has received numerous personal awards in her distinguished career , which has seen her claim seven successive @entity88 titles , six in @entity89 , but a @entity32 honour has proved elusive			1
part - time job : like many of the team , @entity19 's @entity94 ( right ) has to juggle another job - she is a 24 - year - old @entity96 in the week accolades : @entity74 , is a 30 - year - old flanker who , along with @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 , is an ambassador for the men 's @entity79 2015 and works as a manager at @entity82 in the week @entity83 , who is playing in her third @entity32 , said : ' i 've been very fortunate to have got the accolades that i have and all the recognition , which is brilliant			1
' but the real reason why i wanted to get into the sport and play for @entity19 was to be world champion			0
it would mean the world			0
' that 's one accolade i have n't got			2
that 's what i want for the team , as well as an individual thing			1
" i want people to recognise us as the best team in the world			2
' it 's great to see recognition for what are some fantastic athletes , ' she said			2
' the standard of women 's rugby across the world is just getting better and better			1
' success story : prop @entity126 is the most - capped player in the squad with 91 appearances @entity129 , a 31 - year - old lock / back row , said she 'd love the opportunity to play rugby full - time			0
the special needs teacher says she hopes the sport is going in that direction and hopes that girls are n't put off by the seemingly risky nature of the game			2
' this is a fantastic sport and we 're just grateful to be able to play for our country , it 's a tremendous honour , ' she said			2
prop @entity126 is the most - capped player in the squad with 91 appearances - she is also head coach of the @entity144 and @entity145 and , in what time she has left , is also a personal trainer			0
' @entity147 is @entity148 and i got my first cap out in @entity30 where the @entity151 are			1
it 's quite apt really , ' @entity152 said			2
@entity152 hopes for ' third time lucky ' in 2014			0
' we were really close in 2010 and it could 've gone either way , ' she added			0
' that disappointment makes me even more hungry to win this one			0
i 've got four years more experience to take into it			0
' @entity152 is often compared to @entity162 for her longevity			0
she added : ' the first goal is to win the @entity32 , then the second goal will be to get 100 caps			2
when we come into next season and the @entity88 i 'll think about that			0
' @entity19 , who were @entity173 finalists in 2010 , kicked off their campaign against @entity175 back at the start of august and then took on @entity177 and @entity30 before making it to the final , which kicks off at 5.45pm today			1
