medical staff gave the cab driver the wrong address and his passenger @entity2 , 76 , was incapable of telling him where she lived			1
so she had to sit , unchaperoned , in the front seat as the driver tried to locate the home she shares with her husband @entity23 , 80 , more than 30 miles away			1
when she finally arrived at their front door in the middle of a rainstorm she emerged distressed from the car - still clutching the plastic bag with the clothes hospital staff had not bothered to dress her in			1

tragically , within two days of her returning home , mrs @entity2 ’s condition deteriorated rapidly and she was taken into residential care			1
it is unlikely she will return home			1
her family believe that although this would have been eventually inevitable , her ordeal in the taxi hastened her decline			1
mr @entity48 , a retired it consultant who has three children and eight grandchildren with his wife , said he was ‘ resentful , disillusioned and shattered ’ by her treatment			0
he said : ‘ i ca n’t put it into words - it is beyond belief			2
‘ i ca n’t imagine what staff were thinking when they put her into that taxi , undressed , and when it was very cold , pouring with rain and blowing half a gale			2
‘ she was clearly distressed , and stark naked save for a hospital gown and light wrap			0
‘ it was the sheer callousness of the way they sent her home – their shipping her off in the nearest cattle wagon they could find			2
’ in august , mrs @entity2 was assessed by carers and a psychologist and even then was unable to answer the simplest of cognitive questions			1
mr @entity48 , 80 , said he was horrified to find his distressed wife had been sent home by staff at the @entity36 of the hospital , after treating her for a cut to her head mrs @entity2 , a former office manager , was diagnosed with vascular dementia four years ago and has been cared for since then at home in @entity4 , @entity5 , by her husband , with the support of social services and a private carer			1
on wednesday last week , she was rushed to @entity89 , @entity90 , after cutting her head in a fall – but a scan showed it was not serious			0
within a couple of hours , mr @entity48 received a call saying his wife was on her way back to him at home			2
he added : ‘ it would have been obvious to anyone at @entity36 that she would n’t have had any idea which way was up when they put her into that taxi			2
‘ she suffers very seriously with dementia and she ’s not exactly very articulate			0
she would have had no idea where her correct address was or what was going on			0
’ ‘ the cabbie came to the door and the carer took over from there			0
i do n’t think i was in too much of a state to do much			0
‘ the next thing i remember is that my wife was sitting in the kitchen with the carer bending over her taking off her hospital gown and fishing into the plastic bag which contained all of her clothes			1
’ mr @entity48 has formally complained to the trust and to the @entity125			0
the @entity125 is already investigating the @entity126 , which runs the site , after it was one of 11 which featured in the @entity129 highlighting unacceptably high death rates and was put into special measures			0
