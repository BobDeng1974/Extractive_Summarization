a lawyer representing @entity3 ' daughter , @entity29 ( left ) , in her multimillion - dollar lawsuit claims that had doctors not been so busy fawning over the comic during a procedure on her throat , she would have been alive today ' the level of medical mismanagement , incompetency , disrespect and outrageous behavior is shocking and frankly , almost incomprehensible			1
' she said her 81 - year - old mother deserved better			1
@entity43 , a comedienne who crashed the male - dominated realm of late - night talk shows and starred with her daughter on @entity48 in @entity49 , died september 4 , 2014 , a week after undergoing a routine surgery on her throat			1

a federal investigation , ordered by the federal @entity97 , found the @entity17 clinic made several errors , including failing to keep proper medication records and snapping cell phone photos of rivers while she was unconscious in the operating room			1
' had the doctors acted as physicians for @entity3 instead of groupies , @entity3 would have been doing @entity49 last week , ' said @entity94			0
the probe into the clinic also found the @entity111 clinic failed to get informed consent for every procedure performed and failed to record @entity43 ' weight before the administration of sedation medication			0
clinic : in a statement , @entity12 's lawyer announced she is suing @entity17 ( pictured ) in @entity111 , where her mother suffered a fatal complication during routine throat surgery on august 28 @entity3 , who rose to fame on @entity124 , died of brain damage due to lack of oxygen after she stopped breathing during what was meant to be a simple endoscopy and throat exam at the clinic			1
in the lawsuit , her daughter alleges that doctors did not only carry out those procedures , but also conducted an unauthorized exam of her vocal chords and windpipe , leading to a laryngospasm			0
during the spasm , @entity43 's throat seized up and deprived her brain of oxygen so she could not expel carbon dioxide from her lungs , the suit , filed in @entity139 on monday , states			1
but despite the star 's vital signs showing clear symptoms of distress , doctors decided to continue with the laryngoscopy , causing @entity43 to ultimately suffer a heart attack and irreversible brain damage , the court documents state			0
suing : the 47 - year - old television producer is also suing the doctors who treated @entity43 prior to her death aged 81 on september 4 , claiming their negligence triggered the star 's fatal coma			1

instead , @entity171 was rushed to nearby @entity172 in a coma , where she was put on life support			0
however , she never regained consciousness and passed away a week later			0
the complaint names five individual doctors - as well as the clinic on east 93rd street - as defendants			0
' negligent ' : @entity29 explained that the lawsuit ( part of which is pictured above ) stems from her ' unwavering belief ' that no - one should have to suffer the levels of ' medical mismanagement ' that her mother did accused : one of the doctors the suit refers to is @entity171 's private doctor , ent specialist @entity190 ( right ) , who ' was permitted to do an unauthorized biopsy on @entity43 by medical director , @entity192 ( left ) ' one of the doctors it refers to is @entity171 's private doctor , celebrity ent specialist @entity190 , who was ' permitted to do the unauthorized biopsy by the clinic 's medical director , @entity192 '			1

@entity12 ' lawsuit alleges that during the fateful medical procedure on her mother , @entity43 ' doctors brushed off concerns voiced by anesthesiologist @entity209 , who noticed ' incredible edema , ' or swelling , in her throat			1
court documents state that when @entity209 suggested taking a picture of the swelling , the lead doctor , @entity192 , overruled her , calling the anesthesiologist ' paranoid ' and a ' curious cat			0
' the medical team proceeded with the endoscopy , even as @entity171 ' vital signs - blood pressure , pulse , oxygen level and heart rate - all dropped and the levels of carbon dioxide in her blood spiked , according to the lawsuit			2
as @entity43 ' condition deteriorated , her doctors jumped into action trying to revive her , but according to the lawsuit , they failed to give her a muscle relaxant to open up her throat , nor did they perform a potentially life - saving tracheotomy			2
instead , the medics unsuccessfully tried to save their famous patient with chest compressions , intubation and a hand pump for her lungs			0
about 17 minutes later , the anesthesiologist asked for a tracheotomy kit , but it went unused , the suit states			0
the lawsuit claims that @entity190 could have performed an emergency tracheotomy , but she had left the room			2
experts told the @entity253 that @entity29 could win millions of dollars in the suit because her mother was still making good money from stand - up gigs , books and tv shows in the weeks before her death			1
indeed , the comedian performed at a @entity111 club the night before she fell into a coma			2
she had arranged the throat procedure because her voice had turned raspy and she did not know the cause			0
' unauthorized biopsy ' : this section of the lawsuit shows some of the allegations against @entity192 and @entity190 celebrity : experts said @entity29 could win millions of dollars in the suit because her mother ( pictured on @entity274 ) was still making good money from stand - up gigs , books and tv shows before her death the lawsuit comes just two weeks after it was revealed that @entity17 has lost its federal accreditation and will stop receiving funds at the end of january			1
in a letter sent to the clinic , the @entity97 told the clinic it no longer meets their conditions for coverage after failing to identify @entity171 's deteriorating vital signs			0

' as of january 31 , 2015 @entity17 will no longer be eligible to receive federal funds for services provided to @entity289 and @entity294 beneficiaries			2
' despite those losses , the clinic later issued a statement indicating its intention to remain viable			0
' @entity299 does not intend to cease operations			0
