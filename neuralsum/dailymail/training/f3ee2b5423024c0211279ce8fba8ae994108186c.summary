by @entity0 published : 17:09 est , 26 april 2013 updated : 06:46 est , 1 may 2013 @entity2 fan : @entity4 footballer @entity3 with fiancee @entity5 it is one of the world ’s most desirable cars , available only to @entity2 ’s ‘ most loyal and passionate ’ customers			1
so millionaire @entity4 footballer @entity3 must have seemed the perfect choice as a celebrity owner of the new £ 252,000 @entity14			1
but the @entity16 firm was less than delighted when the car turned up on a second - hand dealership ’s website within days of its delivery – with a £ 78,000 mark - up			1
@entity3 ’s agent , @entity22 , says he bought the car himself at the end of last month , and that the footballer ’s name appeared on the paperwork in error			1
however , he denies trying to make money off a quick turnaround , and claims he sold it on to someone else , who then sold it to a dealer			0
the @entity35 , which accelerates to 62mph in 3.1 seconds and has been hailed as the fastest @entity2 ever , was named supercar of the year by the @entity39 ’s @entity38 programme			2
just 800 will be sold this year , of which 10 per cent will come to the @entity40			0
mysteriously , within days of the first right - hand drive model being sold in @entity40 by @entity44 dealer @entity42			2
it was advertised for sale as the star second - hand buy on the website of @entity49 , a @entity51 - based car - dealer with a reputation for helping the super-rich jump waiting lists for the world ’s most desirable vehicles			1
the asking price was £ 330,000			2
the @entity35 in question was ordered in @entity3 ’s name using the footballer ’s @entity44 address in @entity62 , which he shares with his tv host fiancee , @entity5			1
@entity3 ’s name and address were on the original invoice , delivery and registration documents			2
the @entity69 has also established that mr @entity22 arranged payment and delivery through his football management company			0
sleek : the @entity14 pictured on the second - hand dealership 's website , was bought by @entity3 's agent in the footballers name however , mr @entity22 , who was formerly married to @entity78 presenter @entity77 , told the @entity69 he had placed the order for the @entity35 in his own name , paid for it , and driven it away from the dealership , insisting : ‘ @entity3 knew nothing about it and has not driven it			1
' we order lots of our cars through @entity42			0
i ordered the car in my name			2
’ another fan : @entity3 's agent @entity22 claims he was the original buyer of the @entity14 he said that after driving the @entity2 for about 100 miles over seven days he decided he did not like it , and sold it on to a third party			1
he said they , not he , sold the car to @entity49			0
a @entity2 spokesman said : ‘ our official dealers have identified the most loyal and passionate clients who would normally expect to receive the first cars which arrive in the market			2
' our dealers know their client base on a personal one - on - one basis , as befits a luxury premium brand like @entity2			1
’ @entity2 said it could not discuss its relationship with individual customers , but stressed that it was ‘ impossible that a dealer would make an error attributing ownership of a £ 250,000 car to a third party by mistake ’			1
mr @entity22 , however , insisted that a mistake had been made			0
the @entity49 dealership refused to say who sold the @entity35 , and how much it cost			0
but when pressed , boss @entity120 admitted : ‘ the first owner of the car was @entity3			1
’ @entity3 is a long - standing @entity2 fan			1
he has been seen driving many models , including the £ 175,000 @entity124 , the £ 180,000 @entity125 , and the £ 202,000 @entity126			0
@entity3 ’s solicitors did not respond to requests for comment			2
sneak peak : an interior photograph of the @entity14 from the dealership 's website @entity3 - ly clueless : the engine of the @entity2 which @entity3 's agent claims the footballer knows nothing about - despite the fact that it was ordered int he footballer 's name up for grabs : the car is up for sale by second - hand dealership @entity49 , who are selling it for £ 330,000 style : 2 - door , two - seater coupe length : 15ft 2 inches width : 6ft 4 inches height : 4ft 2 inches seats : 2 top speed : 212 mph acceleration : 0 - 62mph:3.1 seconds0 - 124mph : 8.5 seconds engine : 6.3 litre ( 6262cc ) @entity156 naturally @entity157 positioned ‘ mid front ’ – that is in front of the driver but behind the front axle , for better balance			1
