one @entity6 bomb disposal expert said that the use of the chemical is a sign of desperation			1
crude roadside bombs filled with chlorine gas are now being used by @entity4 terrorists , it has been reported @entity22 told the @entity23 : ' they 're resorting to this new method , putting chlorine in these home - made roadside bombs , which is toxic to those that inhale it			2
' he described how his team detonated a bomb in @entity34 that , unbeknown to them , contained chlorine			1
they immediately began feeling the effects of the chemical , experiencing ' painful choking ' and blocked throats			1
the @entity23 has been shown footage of bright yellow gas rising up from a roadside bomb explosion that the @entity6 say is chlorine , as well as film of the @entity34 explosion			1
@entity48 , senior research fellow at defence thinktank @entity49 , told @entity51 that although chlorine can be lethal , it does appear that it 's being used to spread fear by @entity4			0
she said : ' chlorine is easily available from a number of industrial sources and is very hazardous â€“ causing breathing difficulties in particular and in extreme cases prolonged exposure can kill			0
' used in roadside bombs such as this , in the open air , it disperses reasonably quickly and so appears to be intended to cause panic rather than serious harm			0
' she added : ' there is no doubt that public perception often sees chemical weapons such as this as more dangerous than conventional weapons such as explosives , even though it may not be the case that a chlorine bomb could cause more harm			1
in fact , the most damage is likely to be done by the explosion created to disperse it			0
' chlorine was used by the @entity81 in the @entity82 , but it proved to be unreliable			0
in one attack in 1915 the gas blew back into @entity81 trenches after canisters of the chemical were fired from heavy guns at the @entity89			1

the resolution follows last month 's condemnation by the world 's chemical weapons watchdog of the use of chlorine in @entity105 as a breach of international law			2
the @entity122 ' fact - finding mission concluded ' with a high degree of confidence ' that chlorine was used on three villages in @entity105 last year , killing 13 people			0
