by @entity0 @entity3 @entity2 gov. @entity1 vowed saturday to fight a criminal indictment in a defiant response that showed an old slice of swagger that he 's kept holstered lately while seeking to remake his image for a potential 2016 presidential run			1
@entity1 called two felony counts of abuse of power issued by an @entity13 grand jury ' outrageous ' and made no apologies for his 2013 veto that prompted a criminal investigation against the longest - serving governor in @entity2 history			1
@entity1 made it clear he will finish his term that ends in january and said it was the investigation against him — and not his actions — that amounted to an abuse of power			2
a @entity26 grand jury on friday indicted @entity1 for carrying out a threat to veto state funds to the local district attorney , an elected @entity29 , @entity29 , who refused to resign following a drunken - driving arrest			1
@entity2 gov. @entity1 denounced his indictment for abuse of power , which came after he carried out a threat to veto funding for state public corruption prosecutors ' we do n't settle political differences with indictments in this country , ' @entity1 told reporters outside his office in the @entity42			1
' it is outrageous that someone would use political theatrics to rip away at the very fabric of our state 's constitution			0
' @entity1 , the first @entity2 governor since 1917 to be indicted , again dismissed the charges as nakedly political and said he would not hesitate to execute a veto under the same circumstances again			1
' the details of my decision - making were very clear			0
i said early on that i was going to clearly veto those dollars as long as they had someone in that office who i had lost confidence in , ' @entity1 said			2
' and i had lost confidence			0
' @entity1 's veto cut $ 7.5 million in funding to the state 's ethics watchdog housed in the @entity26 district attorney 's office			1
a @entity2 state judge assigned a special prosecutor to investigate the veto following a formal complaint filed by a left - leaning watchdog group , which accused @entity1 of trying to leverage his power to force the resignation of district attorney @entity29			1
that unit of public corruption investigators is based in @entity13 , a liberal haven in mostly conservative @entity2 and a city that reliably elects @entity78 to serve as district attorney			1
@entity1 says the charges against him are abuse of power , which is exactly what prosecutors are accusing him of doing at the time @entity1 demanded @entity29 's resignation , her unit had just begun investigating the @entity86 and @entity87 of @entity2 ( @entity88 ) - a $ 3 billion pet project of @entity1 's - regarding suspicious state grants disbursed by the institute to allies of @entity1			1
@entity1 said he was confident that he would prevail and vowed that those responsible for this ' farce of a prosecution ' would be held accountable			0
many @entity78 criticized @entity1 's aggressive reaction to the indictment and accused him of trying to shift the blame			2
yet state sen. @entity99 , the face of the party in @entity2 who 's running a high - profile campaign for governor , took a more cautious tone saturday			1
' the charges that were brought down by the grand jury are very , very serious , ' @entity106 said , adding that she trusted the justice system to do its job			1
tensions between @entity3 and the public integrity unit have simmered for years			0
conservatives have long grumbled that the unit operates through a partisan lens and targets @entity3			0
former @entity118 @entity117 and former @entity118 sen. @entity119 , two republicans , are among the biggest past names to have been indicted in @entity26 on ethics charges			2
@entity119 was acquitted and an appeals court overturned a guilty verdict against @entity117			0
in an interview with @entity127 today , the man behind the campaign to have @entity1 indicted welcomed the move			2
@entity129 , the founder of @entity130 , filed the original complaint against @entity1 last year			0
' we think any governor , particularly @entity1 should consider stepping aside			2
any governor under indictment for multiple felonies should step down , ' said @entity129			0
' the grand jury decided that the governor went way beyond trying to bully the @entity139 : he crossed the line into law breaking			1
' on @entity29 he added : ' she served her time			0
she was prosecuted for her time , and she did her time			0
she again then was under prosecution from the county to see if she should give up her job , that judge decided she should not			0
