questions have emerged over whether @entity2 ' mistress leaked details of the @entity5 's investigation into the deadly attack on the @entity8 consulate in @entity9			1
suspicions over how much @entity11 knew about the probe come as the @entity5 's former boss stepped down on friday over the alleged affair , days before he was to testify in the investigation			1
officials say they expect he will still testify over the incident , which left four @entity8 dead on september 11 this year , yet it will be delayed			1
the new concern comes over what , if any , confidential information he shared with his biographer and alleged mistress			2
' now i do n’t know if a lot of you heard this , but the @entity5 annex had actually - had taken a couple of @entity32 militia members prisoner and they think that the attack on the consulate was an effort to try to get these prisoners back , ' she said , according to the @entity47			1
' so that 's still being vetted			0
' in response , the @entity5 denied that claim on sunday when the tape of @entity11 's talk surfaced , saying that it was not true			1
the agency confirmed that since 2009 they have not had the authority to detain prisoners			0
' any suggestion that the @entity58 is still in the detention business is uninformed and baseless , ' they told the site			0
the only other news station to report that claim at the time that @entity11 made her speech to the @entity33 was @entity64 , which she references moments before making the claim about the alleged prisoners			1
according to the clearest timeline of @entity11 and @entity2 ' alleged affair , which is said to have started in 2011 and ended in ' early summer ' of this year , they would have been broken up for at least a few months by the time of this conference			1
she went on to defend both the government 's controversial reaction to the crisis and the @entity5 's lack of disclosure			2
disclosing possible secrets : at the @entity81 talk in october , @entity11 spoke about a theory that the embassy was holding a number of @entity32 prisoners at the time of the september 11 attack making the rounds : she spoke regularly about @entity2 in an effort to promote her book ' the challenging thing for @entity2 is that in his new position he is not allowed to communicate with the press			1
so he ’s known all of this , they had correspondence with the @entity5 station chief in @entity32			2
within 24 hours they kind of knew what was happening , ' she said			0
' if you remember at the time , the @entity108 video , the @entity109 video that came out , the demonstrations that were going on in @entity106 - there were demonstrations in 22 other countries at the time , tens of thousands of people and our government was very concerned that this was going to become a nightmare for us			0
' so you can understand if you put yourself in his shoes , or secretary @entity120 's shoes , or the president 's shoes , that we thought it was tied somehow to the demonstrations in @entity106			0
it 's true that we have signal intelligence that shows the militia members in @entity32 were watching the demonstrations in @entity106 and that did galvanize their efforts			2
' as a former intel officer , it ’s frustrating to me because it reveals our sources and methods			0
i do n’t think the public needs to know all of that			0
@entity11 has come under intense scrutiny ever since @entity2 , the four star general credited with the surge in @entity138 , submitted his resignation citing an extramarital affair			1
working benefits : @entity11 wrote that she learned a great deal by being mentored by @entity2 out : @entity2 resigned on friday november 9 citing an extramarital affair during the lengthy discussion , @entity11 's high aspirations are clear as she spoke repeatedly about how she has had the life - long goal of becoming the @entity148			1
when asked if she had the chance to talk to any previous @entity148 's , she said that she had not but she considers ' @entity150 ' and ' @entity151 ' to be great role models , referring to @entity153 and @entity151 by their nicknames			0
@entity11 's high achieving personality and her unusually comfortable nature around @entity2 raised concerns among @entity2 ' close advisers in the year leading up to the revelation of the affair			2
to those outside the general 's tight - knit circle , however , news of the affair came as a big surprise when it was announced on friday			0
@entity2 was expected to make headlines when he was made to testify in front of @entity170 about what and when the @entity5 knew regarding the timeline of events in @entity32 when a group of terrorists stormed the consulate killing ambassador @entity175 and three other @entity8			1
the affair was discovered by the @entity178 when they responded @entity179 , a @entity180 woman and friend of @entity2 who allegedly received email threats from @entity11			2
both @entity179 and @entity11 are married with children , but that did n't stop @entity11 from becoming defensive of @entity2			2
she supposedly told @entity179 to ' stay away from my man '			0
though there were multiple threatening emails , none of them were considered criminal so the @entity178 has not charged the army reservist			0
news of the affair ' was like a lightning bolt ' , said @entity197 senator @entity196 who heads the @entity198			0
@entity2 was scheduled to testify in front of @entity170 on thursday , but that has since been pushed back in light of his resignation			1
now his replacement , @entity5 deputy director @entity204 , will appear instead of @entity2			1
@entity196 went on to say that just because @entity2 no longer works at the @entity5 , that does prohibit @entity170 from compelling him to testify about @entity9 at a later date			1
