by @entity0 published : 07:23 est , 9 april 2013 updated : 11:05 est , 9 april 2013 the trend for baking has swept the nation of late , with cakes , cookies and confectionary fast becoming the ' it ' food of choice			0
but while other bakers battle with candied flowers , butterflies or pretty pastel icing , one adventurous type has created an array of disgustingly realistic sweet treats - including fungal toe cookies ( complete with your choice of corn or chilblains ) , severed ear cake - pops , or blackened lung cake			1
and if the @entity26 baker 's cake covered in stubbed out cigarettes does n’t whet your appetite , then how about a trashed trifle or a fish carcass cookie ? yummy : the severed toe cookies are incredibly realistic and come with either fungus , corns , or chilblain tempting ? the ashtray cake may look like it has been attacked by chain smokers , but the cigarettes are in fact cookies covered in icing for those with a strong stomach and a sweet tooth , there is a choice of three mini toe cookies - fungal nail , corn and chilblain - all of which look like they have been freshly severed from a body			1
the chilblain toe is even crafted to reveal a bone peeking out of the top			0
similarly gruesome and realistic are the severed ear cake pops			2
intricate : there is such a high level of anatomical detail in both the severed toe cookies ( right ) and ear cake - pop ( left ) with wax inside the ears and harden skin on the underside of the toes originally designed for the @entity66 : this time it ’s anatomical 18 + pop - up cake shop last year , the ears even have wax visible inside			1
the ashtray cake comes complete with individual ‘ cigarettes ’ stubbed out all over it and in the ashtray on the top , some of which even have lipstick marks around the ends			1
the cigarettes are individually shaped biscuits that are then covered in icing and painted , while the tobacco around them is a mixture of crushed biscuits and dyed coconut			0
also covered in the sweet cigarettes is the ‘ @entity90 ’ , which bizarrely has a ( sweet ) pork pie on it			0
sorry for itself : the ' trashed trifle cake ' perfectly emulates a cake in the aftermath of a party , with cigarettes , cheese on cocktail sticks and even a pork pie on it off - putting : the blackened lung cake shows the effects of smoking on the body ( but still tastes delicious ! ) deceiving : the fish carcass cookie might look like something you leave on your plate but it is a sweet treat designed to resemble a trifle left over after a party , it has canapé blocks of cheese on cocktail sticks abandoned on top - and it certainly accurately resembles a dish looking rather sorry for itself the morning after a big bash one of the more foul offerings is the blackened lung cake , which , showing the effects of smoking on a pair of ( sponge ) lung , would put the most harden smoker off their next puff			0
these vile creations are the work of @entity129 , a bakery based in @entity131 , @entity26 which usually sells less more attractive treats in the shape of handpainted wedding cakes .			2

gross treats are the creation of @entity138 , in @entity131 , @entity26
severed toe biscuits come with corns , chilblains or fungal nail
the ashtray cake features individual biscuit cigarettes
originally made for @entity66 : this time it 's anatomical shop
