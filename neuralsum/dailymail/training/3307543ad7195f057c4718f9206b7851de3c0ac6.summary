by @entity0 published : 13:24 est , 4 february 2013 updated : 15:42 est , 4 february 2013 a classic @entity1 raced to victory by sir @entity3 has been sold for more than £ 7million - making it one of the most expensive cars ever sold in @entity6			1
sir @entity3 , 83 , drove the @entity1 @entity8 in 1960 when he won three races out of three			1
the following year , with @entity12 behind the wheel , the same car chalked up a further three victories and a second place			0
but because sales of classic ferraris are handled ' behind closed doors ' like those of fine works of art , news about the sale has only just surfaced			0
@entity36 , a vehicle acquisition specialist at @entity39 - based @entity38 , confirmed the firm had brokered a deal but would not reveal the agreed price - tag or discuss the two parties involved			0
however , it is thought the car - known as @entity45 - sold for in excess of £ 7million , making it one of the most expensive cars to ever change hands in the @entity6			1
another alloy - bodied 250 @entity8 , with no racing provenance , fetched £ 5million at auction in the @entity54 last month			2

' @entity72 had ordered 2119 gt from @entity1 for @entity3 to drive in the @entity73			2
' @entity3 had suffered a severe accident at @entity75 earlier in the season and was a doubt to start the race			0
' telegrams in the history file of 2119 @entity20 document correspondence between @entity72 and @entity1 including the message from @entity72 to @entity1 declaring " @entity3 is fit ! " and that the car would be needed in time for the race on august 20 , 1960			1
winner : the car has a top speed of 152mph and a 0 - 60mph time of 6.2 seconds ' in the race itself @entity3 and 2119 @entity20 were in a class of their own			2
@entity3 won the race by two laps			1
' it was the first @entity1 to win the tt and it remains completely original , the engine and gearbox are both original			1
' it is a very famous @entity6 @entity1 and it has hardly been seen in recent years and we are delighted it will be staying in the @entity6			0
' it is a unique car			0
it was sympathetically restored by @entity38 in the 1980s and is the best car we have sold in recent years			0
deal : chassis number 2119 , which has been owned by businessman @entity27 since 2003 , was sold discreetly in the past six weeks important : @entity36 , a vehicle acquisition specialist at @entity39 - based @entity38 , said the car was ' one of the most important ferraris in existence ' ' without doubt 2119 @entity20 is the most iconic @entity109 and indeed one of the most important @entity110 in existence			0
1960 : @entity3 as driver 1st - @entity73 , @entity112 , @entity113 1961 : @entity12 as driver 1st - @entity115 - @entity114 , @entity117 - @entity116 ( driven by @entity118 ) 2nd - @entity73 , @entity119 , @entity120 ' it is a great honour for @entity38 to have been given the responsibility of maintaining and selling what we consider to be one of the greatest @entity126 in existence			2
' under the bonnet of the @entity129 - which was the 39th model built - is a 3 - litre v12 engine which develops around 300bhp			0
this gave it a 0 - 60mph time of 6.2 seconds and a top speed of 152mph			0
the @entity1 was built in august 1960 with @entity3 winning the @entity73 at @entity64 race track later in the month			1
during the race , @entity3 covererd 108 laps in three hours , averaging 85mph			0
it was the first time @entity1 had won the @entity73 with the @entity140 car manufacturer responsible for the winning cars over the next three years too			2
