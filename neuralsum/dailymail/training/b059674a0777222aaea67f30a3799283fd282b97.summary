the financial drama at @entity1 has taken a new twist , with lawyers representing the club ’s former managing director , @entity4 , writing to the @entity6 to say he can provide information relating to serious allegations about the club ’s co-owner , @entity12 , in its purchase of the club in 2012			1
a letter making the claims , including a potential breach of @entity20 @entity19 sanctions , has been sent to @entity6 chief executive @entity21 — who was chief executive at @entity1 in 2012 — and the @entity6 ’s director of legal affairs , @entity24			0
@entity12 deny wrongdoing and question the credibility of @entity4 , 37 , who has been held at a @entity29 police station without charge since may , accused of misappropriating more than £ 3m of @entity12 ’s money , for whom he used to work			1
lawyers representing @entity4 , who has been held in @entity29 since may , have written to the @entity6 a @entity12 spokesman said : ‘ we are not aware of this letter and so can not comment in any detail			1
we are satisfied @entity12 has always behaved in an appropriate manner ... however , one of our former employees has been subject to both criminal and civil investigation over a variety of possible criminal actions , including fraud and money laundering , during the last few months and we are therefore unable to answer on specifics			0
’ @entity4 was @entity12 ’s front man when they bought @entity1 from @entity46 in late 2012 for around £ 17million and as such is party to intimate knowledge of the firm ’s business			2
well - placed sources acknowledge @entity4 did indeed receive the funds he is accused of misappropriating from @entity12 although his defence , whenever it is lodged , will say he was owed the cash in salary , commissions and expenses			2
lawyers representing @entity4 have written to @entity6 chief executive @entity21 @entity4 ’s new accusations against @entity12 will run the risk of implicating himself , as a former employee and insider			1
the letter from @entity4 ’s lawyers continues : ‘ clearly the information will need to be investigated thoroughly and our client is keen to assist in this process			2
’ @entity72 have declined to comment but because @entity12 still owns and / or control 25 per cent of the club , the situation is potentially a huge embarrassment for them as a body and for @entity21 personally			0
@entity21 worked at @entity1 under @entity12 until summer 2013			0
he became the @entity6 ’s chief executive officer last autumn			0
a @entity12 spokesman said : ‘ the funds used to acquire @entity1 and to support the club was from the @entity12 group and its clients and not sanctioned @entity19 funds , as has been insinuated			0
’ the letter said @entity4 has information relating to serious allegations about the club ’s co-owner , @entity90 , in its purchase of the club in 2012			1

lawyers representing @entity4 have written to the @entity6
they claim @entity4 can provide information relating to serious allegations about the club ’s co-owner , @entity12
