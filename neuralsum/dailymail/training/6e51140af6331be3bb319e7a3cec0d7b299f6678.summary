by @entity0 published : 04:35 est , 26 october 2012 updated : 05:38 est , 26 october 2012 seasonal flow patterns seen by spacecraft orbiting @entity4 could have been caused by salty water , new research suggests			1
dark , finger - like features appear and extend down some @entity4 slopes during late spring through summer , fade in winter , and return during the next spring			1
now two @entity10 - based researchers have explained how the intriguing dark streaks could have been caused by the melting and subsequent evaporation of frozen salty water			1
flow patterns : @entity7 , finger - like features appear and extend down some @entity4 slopes during late spring through summer , fade in winter , and return during the next spring the lines , first spotted last year by @entity18 's @entity17 , lengthen and darken on rocky equator - facing slopes from late spring to early autumn			1
research published at the time said that these seasonal changes suggested that a volatile substance was involved , but the environment is too warm for carbon dioxide frost and too cold for pure water			0
some kind of brine was suggested as fitting the bill , but until now there had been no theories as to what that could consist of			0
' we had to find a salt - water mixture that would come and go , ' said @entity36 , a research assistant professor in the @entity37 , and lead author of the new study			0
professor @entity36 and co-author @entity41 , now at @entity40 , investigated forms of salt known to form on @entity4 to work out how they could affect the melting and evaporation points of ice and water			1
this animation shows how the streaks appear , extend , then disappear with the passage of @entity4 seasons the director of @entity18 's @entity4 exploration programme says he hopes that one day the rover curiosity might be brought back to @entity56 by astronauts			1
@entity58 said it was his personal hope that humans would visit the @entity4 in the 2030s or 2040s			1
he said he could imagine astronauts walking up to @entity55			0
mr @entity58 said the roving laboratory 's mission was scheduled to last two years , but it could have enough power for 20 years			0
the @entity18 chief set out his vision during a satellite link up with @entity69 in the @entity70 at the weekend			0
the community of about 280 people has twinned itself with a site on @entity4 that @entity18 has labelled @entity69 - 35 million miles away			2
mr @entity58 said : ' it is my hope that humans will be sent to @entity4 in the 2030s , or 2040s , and they will be able to walk up to @entity55 and bring it back , as i am sure there is a museum out there that would love to have it			2
' basing their model on soils up to 20cm deep , because beyond that depth the seasonal temperatures would not affect the freezing and melting aspects of the salt - water mixtures , they found calcium chloride fits the bill			1
' in one day we could form enough liquid to create these flow features on the surface , ' professor @entity36 said			2
the model also explained why the flow features disappeared by incorporating evaporation into the model			0
' the easier it becomes to melt , the easier it becomes to evaporate , ' the professor said			0
at low concentrations of brine , ' as soon as it melts , it evaporates and disappears			0
' the researchers showed that they could melt enough calcium chloride brine so that it would not completely evaporate , thus creating conditions that might explain the flow features			1
their model fits with the seasonal change in flow observations , with the flows occurring on equator facing slopes and with seasonal changes			2
also , high surface evaporation rates as demonstrated in their model explain why , if there is water , it would disappear relatively quickly and why imaging spectrometry on @entity4 has not identified water signatures			1
@entity4 is now a frozen desert , but geological studies of rocks by previous missions to the surface have suggested the planet used to be warmer and wetter			2
finding water is a first step toward learning whether the environment could support microbes			0
scientists generally agree that besides water and an energy source such as the sun , organic carbon is a necessary prerequisite for life .			0

flow patterns appear down slopes during late spring then fade in winter
researchers say it could be caused by calcium chloride brine
if water exists on @entity4 , then it could prove *habitable* to some form of life
