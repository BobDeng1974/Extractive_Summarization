quel horreur : @entity1 , which means red lollipop , is designed to win new wine fans a @entity5 drinks company is launching a red wine that will have the edge on its competitors - by adding a dash of cola			1
in a break with tradition @entity12 , @entity5 for red lollipop , is made from 75 per cent grapes with water , sugar and cola flavouring making up the remainder			1
sure to horrify connoisseurs , it is designed to appeal to the younger ' @entity22 generation '			1
winemakers fear that young people who drink endless spirits and mixers will be difficult to attract if they do not adapt to their sweet palette			0
the 9 per cent @entity29 blend is part of a new range by @entity33 - based firm @entity32			2
they also make fruity @entity35 and @entity36 blends			0
the company recommends serving it ice - cold for the summer weather			0
it went on sale this week for 2.95 euros a bottle and is hoped to become a feature of @entity5 barbeques and summer drinks parties			1
@entity45 , marketing director of @entity32 , said : ' the result is surprising ; the balance between the bitterness of the wine and the sweetness of the cola is perfect			2
' ' we did a lot of research to elaborate the best recipe and the best mix between wine , water and the aroma			0
' the packaging is fun , with a label in the shape of lollipop			0
' this kind of product is more dedicated to young adults , and women			0
inspiration : @entity12 's bouquet will be flavourings of cola young fans : the @entity5 company is hoping a wine as sweet as cola will appeal to young drinkers who prefer spirits and mixers ' we have worked closely with a lab in @entity82 , specialised in aroma			1
' despite having a reputation for their snobbish attitude to wine , the @entity5 themselves have actually embraced flavoured wines , drinking a predicted 30 million bottles in 2013			2
cola wine could also be a big hit in @entity93 , as sugar consumption has increased by 31 per cent since 1990 , with the average person consuming 700g of sugar a week .			1

@entity12 is only 75 per cent wine , the rest is sugar , water and cola
@entity5 drinks firm hope it will appeal to young ' @entity22 generation ' drinkers
