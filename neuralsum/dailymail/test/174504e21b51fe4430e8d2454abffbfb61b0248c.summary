@entity0 expects @entity1 to be fit and ready to aid @entity2 ’ play - off push towards the @entity4			1
the @entity6 international finally joined up with his @entity8 team - mates this week , more than two months after he was one of five @entity10 players sent north on loan to the @entity13 side			1
@entity1 has not played since his country ’s 2 - 0 @entity15 qualifier win over @entity17 in @entity18 in october and the 23 - year - old ’s knee injury had been expected to keep him out for the season			1
@entity2 manager @entity0 takes a training session at @entity23 on tuesday morning but @entity0 revealed : ‘ @entity1 ’s been out for five months but the good thing about him is his mental state			1
i spoke to him on monday and i was really impressed			2
do i get the impression he is he is here to play ? yes , definitely			0
‘ i liked the way he was talking , he wants to get straight into it			0
he ’s a naturally fit lad and he seems really focused too , so that was pleasing			0
‘ he trained really hard on monday and on tuesday and he ’s on his way to a quick recovery , which would be positive news for us			2
‘ if our under - 20 game ( against @entity35 on tuesday ) had not been on astro turf , he might have got an hour under his belt			2
‘ but if you ’ve been out that long you ’re going to need four to six weeks to get back on track			0
so he certainly wo n’t be ready in the next two weeks but hopefully he will play his part in the back end of the season			0
” @entity10 loanee @entity1 takes part in the training session rangers were controversially loaned players from @entity10 in january , when @entity48 and @entity50 supremo @entity49 was still calling the shots in the @entity8 boardroom ahead of the @entity54 - led takeover			1
then - manager @entity55 sensationally revealed he had been ordered to play all five when fit			2
but with @entity2 believed not to have carried out medicals , @entity56 and @entity1 have not featured through injury and fitness , while @entity60 is believed to have a blood disorder			1
defender @entity62 went off injured after 44 minutes of his debut and has not been seen since , only @entity66 @entity65 has been a success , scoring six goals in his last seven games			0
but @entity0 now hopes he can call on a player who impressed last summer in friendlies for @entity6 against @entity72 and @entity73			1
‘ i ’ve spoken to a couple of lads like @entity76 , who know @entity1 from @entity6 , and it ’s all positive , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i also spoke to @entity6 manager @entity79 about him			2
he ’s filled in at left - back for them but probably his best position is one up on the left			0
he ’s certainly a good crosser of the ball , he ’s shown that in the sessions we have done			0
@entity1 ( right ) finally joined up with the @entity2 squad in @entity89 this week ‘ i went through his @entity90 last night and i think he ’s played 23 games for @entity10 in the @entity92 and 30 for @entity93			1
you do n’t play that number unless you ’ve got something about you			0
’ @entity2 must pay @entity10 an extra £ 500,000 over and above wages for the loan players if they go up through the play - offs but @entity0 would be delighted if that happens			1
‘ it was a surprise to everyone when the news about that came out , because it ’s quite a lot of money , especially when only one of the ( loan players ) is playing , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ but if it was me - and it ’s not because it ’s not my money - i ’d love to give @entity10 £ 500,000 because that means we have got promotion			1
’ defender @entity112 echoed his manager ’s views and insisted that promotion was all that mattered after what has been a roller - coaster season			0
@entity2 defender @entity112 trains as the club look to claim promotion to the @entity4 ‘ a lot of fans would accept it has been a bad year and all the boys will hold their hands up and say it has not been good enough , ’ said the 29 - year - old			1
‘ but if we do get promoted , it would be seen as a successful season			0
i know that ’s quite hard to comprehend but from where we were a couple of months ago , to actually get up would be good			0
‘ winning the league would have been great but the aim was always to get promotion			0
and the way the season has panned out for us , it will now need to be through the play offs			0
’ @entity137 and @entity2 are currently locked on 61 points , with wednesday 's match at @entity140 representing the @entity8 side ’s game in hand			1
the @entity145 club have a better goal difference of +2 but @entity112 is happy that @entity2 remain in control of their destiny with @entity149 away and @entity150 at @entity8 their remaining two matches after their visit to the @entity152 on wednsday			1
@entity2 players prepare for the trip to bottom - of - the - table @entity140 on wednesday night ‘ we know our goal difference is short at the moment , but we also know if we keep winning game it ’s in our hands to finish second , ’ said @entity112			1
‘ if we beat @entity140 , we are three points clear			2
‘ we want to finish second because that would give us one week more preparation for the play - offs			2
so we want to win every game until the end of the season			0
‘ we ’ve shown a glimmer of what we are capable of lately and we need to bottle that and take it to @entity171			0
