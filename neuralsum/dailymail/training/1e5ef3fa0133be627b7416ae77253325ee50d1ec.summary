skaters are often music lovers , so it was only a matter of time before the two hobbies were combined			0
a student has created a modified skateboard that has speakers built into the base - and even a dock for a mobile phone or music player			2
and , in addition to playing music from the docked device , the @entity12 can charge its battery using kinetic energy generated by the board 's spinning wheels			1
the device has a docking station for the @entity29 and @entity30			1
when turned on its side it can charge the phone and it also has speakers to play music the @entity12 was created by @entity37 as part of a graduation project at the @entity40 in @entity25			1
he is now seeking funding for the project on @entity43			2
the two dynamo ’s in the rear axles of the board generate @entity47 each			0
this electricity is then converted back to a @entity50 current and gets stored in to a powerbox			0
when a user docks their iphone into the board , the powerbox automatically begins charging it			0
while in the dock , users can also play tracks using a speaker in the base			0
it is currently a prototype , but its designer plans to launch a @entity43 campaign to fund production			2
two dynamos generate @entity47 when they spin , which is converted to a @entity50 current in the box of the skateboard			0
aside from powering the speakers , this also charges the phone when it ’s plugged in			0
the @entity12 docking station is currently compatible with the @entity29 and the @entity30 , although a 3.5mm headphone jack and a usb 2.0 port means other devices can also be used			1
the wheels of the board charge a battery pack in the board as it moves			1
one hour of riding can completely charge a phone			2
the board also has a 3.5mm headphone jack and usb port for use with other devices in the wheels ( pictured ) two dynamos generate @entity47 when they spin , which is converted to a @entity50 current in the box of the skateboard			1
aside from powering the speakers , this also charges the phone when it ’s plugged in riding the board for one hour generates enough power to fully charge a phone , while the built - in battery can charge a phone eight times over			1
‘ i really want to develop it further , and bring it to market , ’ van den @entity37 told @entity109			0
‘ so i ’m looking for a team of people who want to technically develop @entity12 , and an investor would be great to get the project off the ground ! ‘ because i just graduated i do n’t have the financial capacity to finance it on my own			0
’ designer @entity37 plans to start a @entity43 campaign on monday 29 september to raise funding for production of the @entity12 ( pictured )			1

@entity12 was built at the @entity22 in @entity25
the device has a docking station for the @entity29 and @entity30
when turned on its side , the electric board can charge the phone
it also has *underside* speakers that play music from a docked phone
the wheels of the board charge a battery pack in the board when it moves
student inventor claims an hour of riding can completely charge a phone
it also has a 3.5mm headphone jack and usb port for other devices
designer @entity37 is now seeking funding on @entity43
