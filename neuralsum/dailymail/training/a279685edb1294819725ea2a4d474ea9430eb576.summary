' @entity0 did n't happen ' : feminist academic @entity1 believes men are even less tolerant of women than in the 1970s @entity1 has claimed that women are worse off than ever because of the proliferation of online pornography and the torrent of abuse they have to endure on social media such as @entity10			1
the sites have become a forum for ‘ the loathing of women ’ , says @entity1 , whose ground - breaking book @entity15 revolutionised feminist thinking in the 1970s			1
‘ @entity0 has n’t happened , even sexual liberation did n’t happen , ’ she argues			0
‘ what happened was that commercial pornography was liberated , fantasy was liberated , but people were n’t liberated			0
’ the @entity23 academic delivers her damning verdict in a @entity25 documentary - blurred lines : the @entity26 - which looks at the threats of rape and violence directed towards women online as well as the ‘ objectification ’ of women in violent computer games and sexually explicit pop videos			1
@entity1 , 75 , tells presenter @entity35 : ‘ things have got a lot worse for women since i wrote @entity15			1
’ she claims the abuse directed at some women online is proof that men are more intolerant of women than ever before			1
‘ i never thought once you had social media there would become this terrible grab bag of loathing of women , ’ she says			1
‘ men are now more aware of women because women keep pushing themselves in			2
‘ nowadays women expect to share men ’s lives , they want to do the same work , they want to play the same games , they want to have the same social life , and i think it ’s driving men nuts			2
and the result would seem to me to be that men are even less tolerant of women than they were before			1
‘ now if men have always needed women to be in a subservient , filial , ancillary position , when they [ women ] stand up and call attention to themselves , it produces reactions which are difficult to manage			2
’ several high - profile women have suffered abuse at the hands of online ‘ trolls ’			1
the author and feminist @entity76 was targeted after she launched a petition calling for female historical figures to be represented on banknotes			0
used to be better : @entity1 is pictured above in 1974 - before the online ' grab bag of loathing of women ' the campaign was a success and the @entity86 announced that from 2017 , @entity87 would be on a new £ 10 note			1
but the campaigner found herself inundated with highly personal abuse and threats			0
at one stage she was receiving 50 threats an hour , and she was so affected that she lost half a stone in two days			0
professor @entity95 was targeted in a similar manner after she spoke out about immigration on @entity25 ’s @entity98 last year			1
the historian had to contend with highly personal comments about her appearance as well as a picture of her face with female genitalia superimposed on it			0
prof @entity95 tells the documentary that such attacks will not deter her from speaking out			2
she said : ‘ you do have to steel yourself a little bit because it is quite affecting when you get this stuff			0
but most of all it is infuriating			0
my views on anything are irrelevant to the size and shape of my vagina , i ’m sorry			0
’ prof @entity95 is worried , though , that such campaigns may deter other women from entering ‘ the public sphere ’			1
she said : ‘ i have decided i am going to face the music			0
but there must be loads of women who think , that is not what i want			0
‘ i do n’t want that kind of rubbish and it ’s vile			0
why would anyone bother to do this unless they were incredibly determined ? it is very bad for women ’s participation in the public sphere			2

@entity137 said that online sphere is a ' grab bag of loathing of women '
@entity1 , who wrote @entity15 in the 1970s , says it is worse now
says online abuse of women shows men are less tolerant than ever
spoke in *upcoming* documentary , also featuring professor @entity95
blurred lines : the @entity26 , presented by @entity35 , is on @entity152 on may 8 .
