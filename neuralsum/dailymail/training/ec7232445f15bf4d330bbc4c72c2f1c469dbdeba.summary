author @entity0 was given total access to @entity2 during the 2013 - 14 season , @entity4 's first in charge of the @entity7 giants			1
in his new book @entity9 , @entity0 uses his behind - the - scenes pass to give readers a unique insight into @entity4 's debut campaign in @entity14			1
in this extract he writes about @entity2 's dramatic @entity17 victory against @entity18 in @entity19 , a win which @entity4 credits as being hugely important to his side 's progression			1
@entity2 's @entity23 ( centre ) lifts the 2013 @entity17 after a penalty shootout win against @entity18 how @entity4 's @entity2 took @entity26 apart at the @entity27 with all the style of @entity29 @entity4 admits @entity30 semi-final defeat to @entity32 was the ' biggest f * * * - up ' of his life as a coach @entity4 admits that he could see himself managing @entity36 one day ( and he turned down @entity26 and @entity18 for the @entity2 job ! ) it 's a feverish , tense , agonising final			1
@entity2 equalise 51 seconds after the official 120 minutes have been played			1
@entity40 referee @entity39 has added one minute for stoppages , and there are nine seconds to go when @entity43 , a player who only three days ago was booked in for surgery , only for @entity4 to cancel those plans , scores for @entity2			1
once again , they 're going head - to - head with @entity18 in a penalty shootout , and everyone 's thoughts turn to the @entity52 , one year ago			1
that day the @entity54 team beat @entity2 in the @entity30 final , in a penalty shootout			1
this could be payback time but , given the option , @entity4 would n't have wished for penalties			1
in the last four weeks the men from @entity62 have scored only three of the five penalties they have taken			1
in the middle of all the euphoria @entity4 steps up to the plate , emotional but icily calm			1
he calls his people together in one big huddle			2
everyone is there : doctors , physios , assistant coaches , players , substitutes and even the injured men , like ( @entity79 ) @entity78			1
this is @entity4 at his brilliant best			1
the guy who rises to the big occasions and dazzles his men			2
just as everyone is expecting him to mobilise his players with a call to arms of epic proportions , @entity4 tells them a simple story			1
@entity43 ( right ) scores a late equaliser in extra-time against @entity18 to force a penalty shootout @entity94 midfielder @entity43 celebrates his goal in front of the @entity2 fans at the @entity98 in @entity19 @entity4 takes a low stance to watch his @entity2 side attempt to beat @entity102 side @entity18 the front cover of new book @entity9 relaxed and smiling , he pays no heed to the thousands of frenzied supporters around them			1
apparently unaffected by the tension , he issues no battle cry , opting instead for an anecdote			0
' lads , i do n't know how to take penalties myself			2
i 've never taken one in my life			0
but here 's the best penalty taker in the whole world			2
' and he points to a figure half hidden , right at the back of the huddle			0
' i 'm talking about @entity124 [ @entity125 ]			0
he was the best water polo player in the world			1
he took penalties better than anyone			2
water polo is like football			1
only four out of every five penalty kicks hit the target , but @entity124 put them all away ! he is the world expert on penalties			1
' @entity4 has n't just managed to get the players ' attention			1
he has completely changed the expressions on their faces			0
they had been waiting for war cries and motivational oratory , an adrenaline boost			0
what they receive , standing here in the midst of the clamouring , heaving mass of humanity that rocks the stadium , is a simple tale			0
( @entity157 ) @entity156 and ( @entity159 ) @entity158 stand just behind @entity4 in their tracksuits , hugging each other ; @entity163 is beside them			1
( @entity166 ) @entity165 , ( @entity168 ) @entity167 and ( @entity23 ) @entity23 are right at the front			0

@entity221 and @entity78 are slightly separated from the main group and @entity223 is n't here			0
he 's off getting @entity225 's advice about the @entity18 penalty takers			1
@entity227 , too , has stepped back a few metres			1
they 're enjoying the tone of this team talk			0
' i 've learned two things from @entity124 and his penalties , so listen up			2
these are the only two things you need to do now			0
' firstly , make up your mind immediately as to where you 're going to put the ball and stick with that decision			0
i 'll say it again			0
decide now , and do n't change your mind no matter what happens			0
secondly , keep telling yourselves that you 're going to score			0
repeat it a thousand times and do n't stop until after you 've taken the penalty			0
do n't worry and do n't change your minds			0

but @entity4 has n't finished			1
he gives them his advice and then says : ' lads , there 's no list			2
you can choose whether or not to take one			0
you 're all going to score anyway , so you decide who 's taking them			2
who 's up for it ? ' @entity170 is the first to step forward , @entity165 lifts his left hand next , followed quickly by @entity167			2
@entity4 gives his captain one of his little taps on the cheek			1
next , @entity23 adds his name to the list and the coach slaps him encouragingly on the chest			0
it 's @entity202 's turn after that and he 's rewarded with a ' @entity280 , @entity281 ! ' the players have come up with the list themselves , but what about the order they 'll take them in ? ' you sort that out			1
take them in any order you want			0
whatever you 're comfortable with			0
it does n't matter anyway , because they 're all going in			0

the referee indicates that it 's time and they all turn away			2
@entity4 grabs @entity23 and @entity167 , stopping the whole group in their tracks			2
' just one last thing			0
