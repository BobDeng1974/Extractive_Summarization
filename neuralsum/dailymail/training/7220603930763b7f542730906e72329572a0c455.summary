the notorious holiday resort is overrun with booze - fuelled and sexually - charged tourists , especially young @entity3 , and local residents and officials with the municipality of @entity29 have finally had enough			1
in july , authorities announced restrictions on tourist pub crawls a week after shocking video emerged showing an 18 - year - old @entity48 woman performing oral sex on 24 men in a nightclub in return for a free drink			1
after the move was announced hotel occupancy by @entity3 fell by three per cent , but officials are undeterred even though they risk losing more tourists			1
at the time , elected officials said they would do whatever it takes to clean up @entity1 's image			2
this week , @entity61 , the minister of tourism for the @entity63 government , told local media that @entity1 would become a ‘ mature tourist zone ’ in time for next year ’s tourist season			2

officials from the municipality of @entity29 want to fly in @entity3 police officers to patrol the main tourist strip she is asking @entity36 ’s @entity107 to deploy teams who specialise in handling large crowds to assist local officers			1
last year , @entity1 brought in police from @entity113 and @entity114 to patrol the main tourist strip , and ms @entity83 said the patrols were effective because tourists showed more respect for officers from their homeland			1
last year , 223 visitors from the @entity3 were expelled from hotels , an increase of nearly 75 per cent from 2012 , when 129 were forced out			1
as of july , 92 @entity3 have been kicked out of @entity1 hotels in 2014 , according to the @entity123			1
it is estimated that one million @entity3 a year visit the area , spending approximately £ 628m ( € 800m )			2

it is part of a trend that is sweeping across @entity36 as residents urge local governments to bring an end to drunken and sexually - charged tourists ’ free - for - all			0
earlier this year , the seafront town of @entity143 , on @entity145 ’s @entity144 , banned stag and hen parties during the month of august and placed them under strict regulations throughout the rest of the year			0

the town is taking action after locals complained about drunken and scantily - clad partygoers urinating in the street and singing loudly in the town ’s squares in the early morning hours			0
on the outskirts of @entity172 , the picturesque fishing village of @entity170 has become a popular stop for young tourists thanks to its all - night raves			0
last august , furious locals held protests at blocks of flats rented to holidaymakers , with chants of ‘ out , out , out drunken tourists ’			0
