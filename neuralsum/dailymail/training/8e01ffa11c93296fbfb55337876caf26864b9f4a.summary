ever since @entity1 made his getaway on a hoverboard in @entity4 , gadget fans have been dreaming of floating along on their own device			0
now , @entity7 architect @entity6 has made that dream come true by developing a hoverboard that floats in mid-air just like the 1980s classic film			1
dubbed the @entity13 , the technology uses four ‘ hover engines ’ which emit magnetic fields that push against each other as long as metal conductor is used in the surface underneath			1
as part of his research , he came up with a method that uses electromagnetic fields to separate the building from the ground in the event of a disaster			0
that same technology , he realised , could also be put to work in a hoverboard that would allow people to glide on air			2
in a video released by mr @entity6 , a man is seen moving smoothly along a custom - built skate ramp on his board , which is held an inch of the ground			1
ever since @entity46 made his getaway on a hoverboard in @entity4 ( left ) , gadget fans have been dreaming of floating on their own device			0
now , @entity7 architect @entity6 has made that dream come true by developing a hoverboard ( design pictured right ) that floats in mid-air unlike the @entity57 board , the technology requires the board to be on top of conductive materials to serve as a secondary magnetic field unlike the @entity57 board , the technology requires the board to be on top of conductive materials - such as copper or aluminum - to serve as a secondary magnetic field			1
the @entity13 uses four ‘ hover engines ’ which emit magnetic fields that push against each other			1
the magnets only work as long as metal conductor is used in the surface underneath			1
so the board underneath the @entity74 can be aluminum and copper to work , for instance			2
the innovation here is in the efficiency of the induction process and the ability to control the movements of the hovering objects			0
the system claims to be able to carry 40lbs ( 18kg ) and has a battery that lasts for around seven minutes			0
maglev trains use similar technology but laying down a track costs around £ 464,000 ( $ 750,000 ) per metre			2
mr @entity6 , however , claims its technology would only cost £ 6,200 ( $ 10,000 ) per metre of track			1
mr @entity6 ’s 19 - person company , @entity94 , is now making the technology inside the device available to the public on crowd funding site @entity98			1
the company is hoping to raise £ 155,000 ( $ 250,000 ) for the campaign and will sell the technology for £ 185 ( $ 299 ) in a box it calls the @entity105 developer kit			1
buyers can take the hover tech outside of the box and put it in anything they want to hover			0
it can carry 40lbs ( 18kg ) and has a battery that lasts for around seven minutes			0
‘ we want to see what you can do with our technology , ’ the company writes on their @entity98 page			2
‘ you can use it for hovering , or for applications we have n't even imagined			0
’ consumers can also buy the complete @entity74 hoverboard from £ 6,200 ( $ 10,000 )			2
in the meantime , the group is working on something called the @entity124 , which will allow people to control the hover technology remotely using a smartphone app. @entity7 group @entity94 claims its technology would cost £ 6,200 ( $ 10,000 ) per metre of track to work the magnets only work as long as metal conductor is used in the surface underneath			1
so the board underneath the @entity74 can be aluminum and copper to work buyers can take the hover tech outside of the box and put it in anything they want to hover			0
it can carry 40lbs ( 18kg ) and has a battery that lasts for around seven minutes			0

@entity13 was *created* by @entity7 architect @entity6
it has four ‘ engines ’ which emit magnetic fields pushing against each other
but they only work if a metal conductor is used in surface underneath
mr @entity6 is now hoping to raise £ 155,000 ( $ 250,000 ) on @entity98
he is also selling technology for £ 185 ( $ 299 ) in @entity105 developer kit
