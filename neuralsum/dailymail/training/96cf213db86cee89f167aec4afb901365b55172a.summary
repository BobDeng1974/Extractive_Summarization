a spokesperson for @entity28 did not immediately return @entity40 ’s request for comment			0
mr @entity7 , who had worked for the show since 2005 , was responsible for the choice to broadcast this summer ’s @entity44 on a delay , so that the events shot live in @entity47 would then be shown at prime time in the @entity49 the executive decision caused outrage , as viewers missed out on @entity47 ’s @entity53 , gymnast @entity54 ’ stunning gold medal - winning performance , and sprinter @entity58 ’s 100m victory hours after they actually happened			1

@entity98 spun the story on @entity114 to highlight the fact that @entity7 is expected to assume a full time role producing the upcoming @entity44 but the move is seen as a clear sign that @entity7 is taking the fall for the pandemonium on set that has been turning off viewers			2
