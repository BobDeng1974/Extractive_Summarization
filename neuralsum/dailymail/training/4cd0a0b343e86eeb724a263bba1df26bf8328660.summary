by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 16:37 est , 25 october 2013 updated : 09:48 est , 28 october 2013 most of the world may be struggling through another year of hard times , but , it seems , no one has told @entity7			1
the department store is making sure the country ’s billionaires – the @entity11 bankers , hedge fund bosses , @entity13 magnates and @entity15 potentates – can look forward to a truly luxurious @entity16 with this hamper , which at £ 20,000 costs as much as many young couples can afford to put down as a deposit on their first home			1
aptly named @entity22 , this gift for the oligarch who has everything brings together some of the most expensive food and drink in the world			1
@entity7 ' hamper , aptly named @entity22 , costs £ 20,000 and includes caviar and fine wines @entity7 insists that it is worth the eye - watering price – but if you are considering getting one for @entity16 morning , be aware of one glaring omission			1
the huge hamper does not come with a turkey			1
and you would need to shell out for a fairly gargantuan bird to grace a table kitted out with the contents of this gift basket			2
there are 25 bottles of wine and spirits , including magnums of @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49			1
the wine selection includes a 2007 @entity52 red and a magnum of sweet @entity54 2002 , both world famous			1
for an after dinner tipple , try the @entity57 single malt whisky , which has been aged for 30 years , or the @entity59 cognac			2
there is a 2kg pack of exclusive @entity63 coffee , which , bizarrely , is collected from the dung of asian palm civet cats after they have been fed a diet of coffee berries			1
apparently , the cats ’ digestive process improves the flavour , delivering what @entity7 calls the ‘ world ’s finest and most expensive coffee beans ’			1
the centrepiece of the feast is the 8kg @entity78 ham , which comes with its own special carving knife			2
the meat , considered one of @entity83 ’s food treasures , comes from purebred black @entity85 pigs that spend their lives roaming free , foraging for a natural diet of acorns			1
the selection of meats also includes @entity93 di @entity92 , an @entity95 salami from the hills of @entity97 that is cured for up to 180 days , @entity85 chorizo , @entity99 from @entity100 , and @entity101			1
established in 1824 , @entity7 has grown to become the most prestigious department store in @entity103 there are not one , but two types of caviar , including a 125g pot of @entity109 from the prized @entity109 sturgeon , a fish that weighs up to 400 pounds and can live for 50 years			1
this is outdone by the even more exclusive @entity113 , harvested from fish in the @entity115 closer to home is a 500g royal fillet of @entity119 salmon , described as ideal for a @entity121 buffet			2
the hamper courts controversy with its two types of @entity124 with truffles , one made of duck liver and the other from goose			1
animal welfare campaigners are pushing for a ban on the delicacy because it is usually produced by force - feeding birds until their livers swell to an unnatural size , taking on the soft texture that is prized by gourmets			2
a decent cheese board is a @entity16 must and the @entity7 range does not disappoint			2
there is a 1.15kg half @entity142 , together with a @entity144 , made from the milk of sheep that graze freely on herbs and grasses			2
there is also a selection of other cheeses , including an 825g round of aged @entity153 , matured for nine months			0
while the traditional turkey and veg have been neglected – there ’s not a sprout in sight – recipients do get an ‘ extra-special three - tiered @entity16 cake , decorated with resplendent ribbons ’ , which weighs in at 9.5kg			0
and of course , there is an @entity164 , inspired by recipes from @entity7 ’ original 1930s range			0
in case pantry staples such as olive oil and orange marmalade seem a little too pedestrian after all that luxury , @entity7 offers them to the discerning customer liberally sprinkled with flakes of real gold			0
the oil alone would set you back £ 750			0
there ’s even a selection of fresh fruit – to help kickstart a @entity182 diet , perhaps			0
a small 68g bottle of @entity185 balsamic vinegar , which is aged for 100 years and normally costs £ 235 , is so exclusive that each one is numbered and presented in a gift box			0
the luxury presentation is finished off with mini mince pies , a box of six @entity16 crackers , table decorations and a @entity7 slate cheese board with a glass cloche			0
the £ 20,000 hamper is delivered in a wooden presentation trunk , rather than a wicker @entity198 , established by @entity200 in 1824 , grew to become the largest and most prestigious department store in @entity103			0
today it has more than one million square feet of selling space in @entity205 ’s @entity204			0
its motto @entity206 , or ‘ all things for all people , everywhere ’ , is somewhat at odds with its modern devotion to providing luxury goods to the super rich			0
in may 2010 , long - term owner @entity213 sold the store to @entity215 , the sovereign wealth fund of @entity217 , for £ 1.5billion			0
the deal was considered so momentous that it was finalised by the @entity217 prime minister , @entity219			0
@entity220 , director of food at @entity7 , said it has a deserved reputation for the world ’s finest hampers			1
‘ the decadence is a showcase of the most enticing and delectable flavours available from across the globe and carefully sourced by our team of experts and suppliers , ’ he added			1
‘ this hamper caters to those with genuine discernment for quality ; from extra virgin olive oil with 24 - carat gold flakes and @entity113 to a selection of finest wines and champagnes			0
’ he stressed that cheaper options are available – for those not thinking of taking out a new mortgage for a few seasonal treats			0
alternatives include a @entity247 at £ 125 and @entity248 at £ 225 .			0
