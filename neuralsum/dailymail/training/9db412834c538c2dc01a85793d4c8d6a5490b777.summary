by @entity0 this summer 's @entity1 saw a number of rising young stars step up to the plate to achieve success in front of a @entity8 crowd			1
one of them was sprinter @entity10 , 20 , who a won silver medal in the 200m and a bronze in the 4 x 100m relay			1
as a former @entity18 champion , @entity16 born @entity10 has been well - known in athletic circles for years			1
but it 's her performance in @entity21 that has put her on the map			2
she welcomes the interest as she thinks it 's great more people are aspiring to be fit rather than thin			2
she said : ' people are now always asking me about my figure and how i get my abs which shows people are striving for a healthy look rather than just trying to be skinny			1
' when it comes to those amazing abs , she said it 's not just about exercise but eating well by following a healthy , protein - rich diet			1
great atmosphere : @entity10 , right , pictured here with teammate @entity60 , left , said she loved competing in front of a @entity8 crowd in @entity21 role model : @entity10 said she has often felt self - conscious about having a muscular physique but wants to show other girls it 's better to be fit than thin breakfast : porridge with a protein shake in it and added berries			1
mid morning : an amino acid shake lunch : prawn stirfry dinner : steak with potatoes and vegetables she said : ' a lot of people think you can get abs just through sit ups but it 's more about diet			2
' everyone has abs so once you get down to a lower level of body fat they will start to show			2
to make them look better you can then do sit ups			0
' olympian @entity95 admitted she used to suffer from some name calling over her athletic build when she was growing up			1
@entity10 said she has been lucky to have never experienced any similar bullying			1
but even though her @entity100 school and local running club , @entity101 , were fully supportive of her athletic talent - she admits it can be difficult growing as a sporty girl			1
she explains : ' it 's hard doing sport from the age of 12 upwards if all your friends have stopped doing it			0
i was determined so i managed to keep it going but a lot of my friends stopped doing sport			0
it 's hard when you are doing something on your own			0
' she added that she often felt self - conscious about having a muscular physique - but took inspiration from role models in athletics like @entity127 sprinter @entity126			1
inspiration : @entity10 , celebrating her success in @entity21 , right , says she 's always looked up to @entity126 of @entity127 , left , as she 's proved women can be feminine and elegant as well as strong and athletic young talent : @entity10 has been running since childhood as a member of @entity136 ' often young girls do n't want to get into sport so i think it 's important they have strong role models to inspire them			1
i 've always looked up to @entity126 , ' she said			0
' she always looks so graceful on the track , she has a really elegant running style			0
she also looks so feminine			2
i think that was something i was conscious of growing up in sport - you do n't want to look too manly			1
' now in turn , she hopes she can inspire other young girls by showing them that a fit physique is much better than a skinny one and that you can be feminine as well as strong			1
she added that it helps that the ' sporty look ' has become for fashionable since @entity155			0
not just with people trying to tone up but with sports brands developing more stylish kit			0
' i wear @entity160 trainers casually as well as when training because they 're in bright , trendy colours , ' she said			0
' sports clothing has also become more fashionable with bright , patterned designs			0
it helps because it makes you want to put on the kit and work out			0
' when she 's not in her sports gear doing running sessions and weight training , @entity10 describes her style as ' edgy ' and she 's mostly likely to be found browsing the rails of @entity175			2
@entity10 joined her local running club at a young age and she hopes the @entity1 , and forthcoming @entity178 , will encourage others - both young and old - to do the same			1
aside from joining a local club or gym to keep fit , she recommends finding ' community walking or cycling routes in your area '			0
she added : ' even if you do n't want to go the gym , there are workouts you can do at home without any equipment like squats and lunges			0
instead of buying weights you can just use a bag of sugar			0
' @entity10 is wearing the new @entity198 boost – a revolutionary running shoe for women , combining energy return innovation with style led design			2
