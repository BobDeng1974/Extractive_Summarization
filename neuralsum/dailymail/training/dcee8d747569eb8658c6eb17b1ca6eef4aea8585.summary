the @entity8 estimates there are 640,000 16 - to 24 - year - old @entity10 ( not in @entity11 )			1

crisis : the @entity8 estimates there are 640,000 16 - to 24 - year - old @entity10 ( not in @entity11 ) @entity24 , an economic analyst at the @entity8 , a left - wing think - tank , said : ‘ we know from countless surveys of employers that they value employability and that those skills are lacking among young people			1
they need people who turn up on time , look presentable and know how to present themselves in an interview			1
’ a separate report , from the @entity37 , also reveals how many bosses are ‘ disheartened , if not downright frustrated ’ by school leavers			0
@entity40 , of the business lobby group , said the education system was letting down young people			0
he added : ‘ businesses i speak to up and down the country want to work with young people and are happy to train and employ them			1
‘ but they are often disheartened if not downright frustrated to find school leavers and graduates do not have the minimum skills they need to join the workforce			0
the research raises fears there are now vast numbers of unemployed who have never learnt the basic work ethic needed to get a job ‘ the most common problems include poor literacy and numeracy , and behaviour and attitudes that do n’t meet business expectations			1
’ examples include having no idea how to make a telephone call , such as having a polite telephone manner , failing to dress appropriately and a lack of punctuality			0
other common faults include having the wrong manner at work , such as being ‘ too matey ’ with senior executives , or simply not even turning up for a job interview			1
mr @entity40 said : ‘ the government must stop fixating on exam results alone and ensure that soft workplace skills are taught in our school			0
if not , young people will continue to be left out in the cold			0
’ despite the large number of young people who are not working , official figures show the number of job vacancies has reached the highest level since the end of 2008			1
the @entity8 said many youngsters struggle to get jobs if they have never worked , a problem which is particularly acute if they have few qualifications			0
one in three young people with less than five gcses with grades between a * and @entity97 and no experience of work are unemployed , compared to only one in six who have work experience			2
mr @entity24 : ‘ a lot of families are better off than they used to be and there is less reason for young people to go out and get part time jobs			2
there is also been an intangible cultural change			0
‘ more people are going to university and there ’s more emphasis on academic study over the work side of things			2
’ he added : ‘ very few employers take account of young people with no experience of the workplace			0
‘ young people who have n’t had exposure to work are disadvantaged in the recruitment process even for quite low level jobs			2
the kind of jobs that are available are mostly customer - facing			2
‘ in the old days , you could stick a young apprentice at the back of the factory			0
but when you are talking about customer facing jobs in supermarkets or service industries , you have to have some social skills			0
’ the @entity8 said the number of out of work young people who have never worked – 640,000 – is only just below the number who have worked at some point – 650,000			2
a @entity146 spokesman said : ‘ we are reducing bureaucracy so it is easy for employers to offer work experience			0
‘ in addition , our new @entity152 programme will make sure young people are work - ready			1
changes to college funding mean they will now be paid for the time students spend on work experience			1
