with the prospect of an @entity3 blast hitting the country next week , it ’s likely that some of us will be feeling the cold in our hands and feet			1
but in my case , my fingers will feel more than just a little chilly			2
it ’s likely that , despite wearing gloves , my ring , middle and index finger will go white and numb , while burning with pain as they lose all circulation			1
although attacks peak in the cold winter months , symptoms for @entity21 ’s can be triggered by air - conditioning or taking food out of the freezer ( file picture ) i ’m not alone in suffering this way			1
it ’s estimated that ten million people have @entity21 ’s , a disproportionate reaction of the circulatory system to even the slightest drop in temperature			1
when this happens , the blood vessels in the fingers and sometimes the toes can contract , cutting off their blood supply			2
the most common form of @entity21 ’s — the one that i suffer with — is known as primary @entity21 ’s phenomenon			1
there is no obvious cause , though it could be genetic — although no one else has been affected in my family			2
about eight out of ten sufferers are women , with most having their first attack before the age of 40			1
in my case , it started in my early 20s , more than 20 years ago			2
in some cases , an underlying health condition such as rheumatoid arthritis can cause the blood vessels to overreact — a condition known as secondary @entity21 ’s			1
it can also be caused by medication such as the contraceptive pill or beta - blockers			1
in severe cases this can cause ulcers on the skin			0
‘ typically , @entity21 ’s causes the fingers or toes to turn white and numb as the blood vessels go into spasm in response to cold temperatures , ’ says @entity65 , a consultant vascular surgeon at @entity66 in @entity67			1
this stops blood flow to the fingers and toes , causing them to turn icy white			0
attacks can last from a few minutes to an hour			1
as blood flow returns , they turn blue and eventually red , accompanied by a burning sensation			0
the burning is caused by lactic acid — a chemical we also produce after prolonged exercise , such as running — building up in the fingers when blood flow is reduced due to low levels of oxygen , and then being released as blood returns to the area			0
about eight out of ten sufferers of @entity21 ’s are women ( file picture ) although attacks peak in the cold winter months , symptoms can be triggered by air - conditioning or taking food out of the freezer			1
‘ being a smoker also increases risk as nicotine makes blood vessels contract , ’ adds mr @entity65 just putting my hand under a cold tap or daring to step outside with bare hands on a cool summer ’s day is enough to trigger my symptoms			1
within moments my fingers will be a bloodless white and numb			0
only this morning , a few minutes after stepping out of a ( hot ) shower , i ’d lost all feeling in the top of my middle finger on my right hand because the bathroom was cold in contrast to the hot water			1
in winter , i get it several times a week , and a couple of times a month in the summer months — – unless there ’s a heatwave			1
and i can tell if it ’s time to turn on our central heating because as soon as i experience any kind of chill , the tips of both my middle and ring fingers lose all colour			1
if i do n’t move quickly , either to cup my hands around a hot drink , or wrap them in a scarf , the familiar deadening feeling spreads to the rest of my index finger , too			0
strangely , it does n’t always affect my feet — – it ’s far more common to affect the hands , though some people suffer with both			1
but to be careful , i always wear thick , woolly tights in the winter as well as thick , sheepskin gloves			0
not only is it uncomfortable , it ’s also extremely inconvenient			1
for me , little every day manoeuvres such as writing become murderously difficult as it ’s impossible to negotiate a pen when your fingers are painfully numb			1
it also makes doing up buttons , punching numbers on a telephone keypad or even using a tin opener difficult			0
there is no cure — all that modern medicine can do is offer drugs such as nifedipine , more commonly given for high blood pressure and angina , which works by relaxing blood vessels to alleviate the symptoms			0
you use these drugs at the point of need — when you are having an attack — but they do n’t address the underlying cause , and stop working when you do n’t use them			0
‘ and some patients can find the side - effects difficult , including bad headaches , ’ says dr @entity176 , consultant rheumatologist at @entity177 and @entity178			1
this is because the drugs relax vessels throughout the body – not just the hands and feet — and this increases blood flow to the brain , thus triggering headaches			0
as i ’m prone to headaches , i ’ve avoided resorting to medication to help my @entity21 ’s , but what are the alternatives ? to find out , i asked surgeon mr @entity65 to assess the latest offerings and rate them on the credibility of science , while i tried them out for myself			1
herbal pills @entity199 , £ 29.95 for 120 capsules , healthy2u.co.uk @entity199 is a herbal medicine , used for circulatory disorders including @entity21 ’s			1

take two capsules three times a day			0
@entity215 : ‘ there ’s some evidence that @entity218 has effects on the chemicals thought to play a part in vascular disease			2
but there are no direct trials i can find that demonstrate a specific effect in @entity21 ’s			1
’ rating : 2/5 my view : i ca n’t say there was any real change when i was out in cold weather			0
however , my hands felt a little warmer in the house than they normally do			0
@entity235 @entity236 , 20 patches for £ 29.99 , @entity238 plaster - style reflexology patches that you stick on the soles of the feet			2
they contain menthol which , it ’s claimed , helps stimulate key reflexology points on the feet to help healthy circulation			2
@entity215 : ‘ the menthol in the patch may have a minor beneficial and temporary effect			0
it seems to affect the fine capillaries creating a minor change in blood flow , so creating a feeling of warmth			0
’ 2/5 my view : it ’s suggested you wear these for three consecutive nights , but that just left me with a gluey mess on my feet in the morning			2
socks made of silver @entity268 , £ 9.54 , silversock.co.uk socks made with silver fibre , which , claim manufacturers , improve circulation @entity215 : ‘ there ’s no evidence to support a pharmacological effect of silver as a way of improving circulation			2
however , there is good clinical evidence that warm clothing does have a beneficial effect on @entity21 ’s symptoms , so just on the basis that it is a thick sock , it should be of benefit			1
’ 3/5 my view : my feet stayed warm when i was outside , but no more so than when i have worn a decent pair of socks			0
hand @entity290 @entity291 — @entity292 , £ 1 , @entity293 @entity294 : self - heating little bags that contain ingredients such as iron powder , salt and charcoal , which , due to a chemical reaction , warm up when exposed to the air self - heating little bags that contain ingredients such as iron powder , salt and charcoal , which , due to a chemical reaction , warm up when exposed to the air			1
@entity215 : ‘ useful and cheap			0
i used these when i went mountain climbing			0
’ 4/5 my view : these are very effective once they have warmed up — which takes about ten minutes			1
they stayed warm inside my gloves for three or four hours			0
@entity314 @entity315 by @entity316 , £ 18.50 for 30g , nutricentre.com a blend of hawthorn , ginkgo and bilberry , taken as a quarter teaspoon of powder mixed with water at meal times , once or twice a day			0
it is claimed that the ingredients naturally maintain healthy circulation			0
@entity215 : ‘ there is some evidence ginkgo has an effect on certain chemicals thought to be important in blood vessels			0
however , ginkgo has been tested in several trials in @entity21 ’s disease and been found to be no better than a placebo			1
’ 1/5 my view : this smells and tastes horrible			0
but i did notice that my hands felt a little warmer when i was taking them — but not outside when it was really cold			0
heated @entity342 @entity345 battery heated mittens , £ 21.45 , primrose.co.uk mittens with a pouch on the back of the wrist area that contains a battery - operated heating device			2
@entity215 : ‘ these work on the principle of keeping the hands warm			0
however , they may be a little heavy to wear			0
’ 4/5 my view : the device took 20 minutes to heat up — so when i was outside , my hands were already starting to feel cold , though not yet going numb as the wadding in the mittens is quite effective			2
@entity358 @entity359 , £ 7.50 , beautynaturals.com contains algae , paprika , ginger , essential oils of rosemary and lavender as well as camphor , which it ’s claimed naturally stimulate the circulation @entity215 : ‘ it may make your feet feel better briefly as ingredients such as camphor may cause a slight change to the capillaries in the skin			2
but no evidence offered that it has any significant effect on @entity21 ’s			1
’ 0/5 my view : this produced a pleasant warming feeling when rubbed into the skin			0
and ( even though it ’s for feet ) i tried it on my hands and they both felt warm for a while			2
not an ideal solution as the cream is a little gloopy and it did n’t ultimately stop my hands from going cold when i went outside , though there was less of a reaction indoors .			2
