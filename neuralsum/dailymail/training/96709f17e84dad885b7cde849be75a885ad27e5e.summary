@entity2 , 17 , had been celebrating his friend 's 18th birthday at a dance music event in @entity11 , @entity12 before he collapsed at the home of a fellow reveller			1
his friends called 999 and attempted cpr on the carpentry student , and although he was rushed to hospital he died shortly after his arrival at @entity20 - just before his worried family arrived to see him			1
police believe @entity2 , from @entity23 , @entity12 , became ill after consuming alcohol and ecstasy during his night out on saturday			1
@entity2 's family were told of his collapse by the hospital at 8.30am on sunday , but by the time they arrived 30 minutes later he had died			1
today , @entity2 's parents and brothers described him as a quiet , shy boy who was passionate about pursuing a career as a joiner , but tragically paid the ultimate price for taking drugs			1
speaking at the family home , grieving father @entity38 said lessons should be learned from his youngest son 's death			1
' it ’s not about just getting the message across to kids but also about getting the message across to parents , ' said the design engineer ' as parents we are all concerned			2
the message is that parents need to set up some early warning network for anything new they hear about			2
' it ’s all well setting up these education programmes for kids like " just say no " , but saying no to a 16 or 17 - year - old is like a red rag to a bull			0
' they need to be informed what these drugs are , what the different strengths are and what is coming in			0
' @entity2 had his whole life ahead of him and was lucky in that he would have had the support to fulfil his ambitions , but all that ’s gone now			1
' @entity2 ’s gone now , we ca n’t bring him back			2
i just hope it ’s a lesson for his friends			2
' the 54 - year - old called for more detailed drugs information to be freely available for both children and parents			1
' lots of kids do it and he was just unlucky			0
he made a mistake and he ’s paid for it , ' said mr @entity2			1
' we talked to @entity2 , but there ’s only so much you can say and that they ’ll listen to			2
tragedy : although @entity2 was rushed to hospital he died shortly after his arrival at @entity20 - just before his worried family arrived to see him ' they ’ll more likely listen to their friends , but nobody made @entity2 take it - it was his choice and he ’s paid the price			1
' @entity2 's mother @entity98 , 50 , said : ' do n’t think it ca n’t happen to you			1
' we want to hide away from it but we ca n’t because we have to go on somehow			0
' it ’s more important to try and get the message you want out , you ca n’t bury your head in the sand			0
' @entity2 , a former pupil at @entity107 , was in his second year of a college course in carpentry and joinery			2
it was a course he loved and one he hoped would lead to a career			0
' he was doing really well			0
it was all coming together , ' said mrs @entity114			0
' it only takes one dodgy pill , one chemical in it , they could take it hundreds of times and then it would be that one time it ’s bad ' @entity121 , @entity2 's brother ' his friends were everything to him			1
he was a really loyal , caring friend - he ’d put his friends first all the time			2
' he was a quiet lad with a wicked sense of humour , like his dad			0
' mrs @entity114 , an administration worker at @entity127 , said she hoped other teenagers would think about what her family was going through following @entity2 's death			1
@entity2 lived on a leafy street in the @entity134 area of @entity23 with his parents and his brother @entity136 , 19			1
his other brother @entity137 , 21 , lives in @entity138			0
@entity137 said : ' people could do it all the time but it only takes one dodgy pill , one chemical in it , they could take it hundreds of times and then it would be that one time it ’s bad			0
' @entity136 added : ' people should be given realistic advice			0
people just do n’t know , they see a pill that has a picture on it or is a certain colour and they think they know what they are getting			0
' ' this is a small community and the people he knows will likely take more notice			0
if it means they think or stop and not take drugs , that will be a positive thing			0
' if people can just stop and try to imagine what we ’re going through now - a kid wo n’t want their parents to go through what we ’re going through			2
the message is simple , just think			0
' police said a post-mortem examination proved to be inconclusive and further tests will now be carried out to establish the cause of @entity2 's death			1
two 18 - year - old men , who were arrested on suspicion of supplying controlled drugs , have been released on bail			0
an inquest into @entity2 ’s death is expected to open later this week .			2
