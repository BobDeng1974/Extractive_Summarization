@entity0 , pictured , has hit out at supermarkets for ' duping customers for many people it is an everyday staple at family mealtimes : a packet of pasta and a jar of tomato sauce bought from a supermarket			1
but off - the - shelf @entity12 food is a ‘ con ’ and a ‘ scam ’ , according to chef @entity0			1
yesterday @entity0 , 77 , who is best known for his popular restaurant chain , accused supermarkets of duping customers into paying too much for poor quality products			1
he claimed the fresh pasta they sell is packaged in a way that will make it weigh more – and therefore cost more , while ready - to - go sauces are made from mediocre ingredients made flavoursome with too much sugar			2
and he said supermarkets are being run by clueless accountants , who favour cost cutting over quality			1
he revealed he ended his collaboration with a major food supplier to chain stores after being told the improved lasagne recipe he had created cost too much - despite being only 10p over the £ 1 budget set			1
and the feisty @entity12 also scolded those who pour oil into water to stop pasta sticking to the pan : ‘ i do n’t know which idiot chef came up with that , putting oil in the water			1
the only time you ever maybe use oil is when you cook sheets of pasta to make lasagne			0
’ cream in pasta dishes also prompts a sour response from @entity53			0
during an interview with the @entity56 , he said : ‘ i do n’t believe very much in pre made sauces because you can make one so easily yourself			0
quality is paramount to @entity12 food and you wo n’t get that from supermarket sauces			1
‘ supermarkets have one task , to distribute in great quantities to everybody , it wo n’t necessarily be good quality			2
even when it ’s the best – @entity71 or something , it ’s never going to be as good as if you make it yourself			0
’ asked if it amounted to a scam @entity0 replied : ‘ it is a little bit , yes			1
’ and he said : ‘ what the industry offer as a fresh pasta is a bit of a con because they store it in a plastic bag to keep the moisture which means it weighs more			0
if it was left out it would go drier , but still be fresh , and therefore weigh less			0
so you would be getting more pasta			0
’ in @entity0 ’s native @entity87 , fresh pasta is made by the tray - load in specialist shops			1
and even the pre-made sauces use only the freshest ingredients			0
here in the @entity92 , he claimed , supermarkets bulk buy their ingredients , meaning they are often not gathered at their ripest			2
veteran chef @entity0 says supermarkets package fresh pasta in a way that will make it weigh more he said : ‘ when you do it yourself you know what you ’re putting in it , you know it ’s the best			1
supermarkets will use tomatoes that are n’t completely ripe so they will add sugar which i would never use			2
if you use good quality ripe tomatoes , fresh or in a tin , they do n’t need any adjustment			0
’ @entity0 has made only one collaboration with a supermarket chain , when @entity112 , which produces most of the fresh food in @entity114 , @entity111 ’s and @entity71 , offered to pay him £ 30,000 if he could improve its lasagne			1
he did and they were happy			0
but it did n’t last long			0
@entity0 said : ‘ three days later they called me and said i ’m sorry we are going back to the old recipe , because it cost £ 1.10 instead of £ 1			1
they could n’t allow a 10 % increase on the cost for a much , much improved lasagne , using much better ingredients			1
they would rather use the cheaper one , the bad one			0
i have abandoned the idea of collaborating with a supermarket again			0
for me supermarkets represent mediocrity , never really good food , even in the higher end places			2
’ @entity0 , who has written 17 books about @entity12 food , opened his first food shop with his wife in 1991			1
eight years later the first @entity53 ’s @entity140 popped up and the chef now has 70 @entity92 restaurants , as well as franchises in @entity144 and @entity145			2
in 2011 he and fellow chef @entity146 travelled around @entity87 for a @entity148 series called @entity149			2
and his latest cookbook , @entity151 , is now on sale .			0
