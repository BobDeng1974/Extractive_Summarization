' comfort letters ' : the former prime minister ( left ) contacted @entity9 ( right ) in an apparent attempt to wriggle out of giving evidence to mps investigating a secret deal to offer @entity15 terror suspects an amnesty , it is claimed through the controversial scheme set up under mr @entity1 ’s government in 1999 , more than 200 paramilitary fighters were assured that they were not wanted by the police			1
mr @entity1 , now the @entity36 ’s @entity35 peace envoy , had faced anger for his reluctance for more than nine months to appear before the @entity40 select committee over the ‘ on - the - runs ’ programme			1
he wrote to mps insisting he had ‘ nothing new to say ’ before the committee instructed him to appear this month			2
but in a phone call to the speaker on monday , the @entity46 leader is understood to have asked whether he had to answer questions in person			2
mr @entity1 had insisted it was unnecessary because he gave evidence in private to a review of the scheme by @entity56			1
the judge concluded last july that the letters , sent out after talks with @entity60 , were not unlawful but there were ‘ significant failures ’ in how the scheme operated			0
a @entity65 insider said : ‘ @entity1 rang the speaker to explain that he could not come on wednesday 14th and tried to get the speaker to say there was no need for him to come along at all			2
' he said he ’d said it all before to the @entity56 review			0
but @entity9 was pretty robust			0
he said it would be very , very bad form if he did not come			0
’ a @entity65 insider said : ‘ @entity1 rang the speaker to explain that he could not come on wednesday 14th and tried to get the speaker to say there was no need for him to come along at all ' a @entity80 source said : ‘ why did he need to go to the speaker if he just wanted to discuss altering the date and time he appeared ? ' it seems very odd			1
it would have been easier to contact the committee chairman or clerk			0
’ mr @entity1 will now answer questions for an hour on tuesday , which some mps believe is disrespectful to @entity7 victims			1
the inquiry was triggered by the case of @entity93 , the man accused of the @entity95 bombing in 1982			0
the letters came to light when his trial collapsed last february after it emerged that the 62 - year - old had been told he would not face prosecution for the blast , which killed four soldiers			0
a source close to the families said : ‘ they are furious with @entity1			0
they believe there are many questions to be asked about the issuing of letters to the @entity7 men			0
’ @entity40 select committee chairman @entity112 said : ‘ mr @entity1 ’s appearance will fill in some gaps			1
' there are a lot of unsolved murders in @entity40 and a lot of people still feel very hurt , and we hope getting to the truth of this matter can help bring some closure			0
’ sources close to mr @entity1 said the allegations were ‘ absolutely not true ’ .			1

mps wanted to question him over deal for @entity15 terror suspects
the call would seem to be an attempt to wriggle out of the appearance
former prime minister managed to limit his appearance to an hour
a previous version of this *article* *suggested* that mr @entity1 had *begged* the speaker to **overturn** an order to appear before the @entity142 and that the speaker had *ripped* into mr @entity1 . mr @entity9 has *confirmed* to us that he was not asked to **overturn** an ‘ order ’ and that rather than him ‘ *ripping* into ’ mr @entity1 , the *conversation* they had was a *cordial* one .
