by @entity0 , political correspondent , for the @entity1 minister could step in to block a proposed 10 per cent pay rise for mps that would take their salaries to £ 74,000 a year , @entity2 indicated yesterday			1
the chancellor made clear his opposition to the move at a time when increases to public - sector workers ’ earnings are capped at 1 per cent			1
he said the proposal by the parliamentary pay watchdog was ‘ not the final verdict ’ and ministers would ‘ tackle the issue ’ after the general election			1
pictured speaking on @entity22 ’s @entity21 show yesterday , @entity2 reiterated that he did not believe the mp 's pay rise should be implemented the @entity25 ( @entity26 ) has recommended that @entity5 should get an extra £ 7,000 on top of their £ 67,000 salary			1
however , in return mps would have to make larger pension contributions and lose lucrative ‘ golden goodbye ’ payments when they leave office			2
@entity26 – which was set up to monitor @entity5 ’ spending after the expenses scandal in 2009 – has defended the plans on the grounds that , overall , there would be no increased cost to the taxpayer			2
but @entity43 , of the @entity44 ’ @entity42 , said : ‘ hiking politicians ’ wages at a time when the national debt is still rising would be totally inappropriate			0
‘ in insisting on a pay rise , @entity26 is demonstrating itself once again to be totally unfit for purpose			1
this overgrown monster of a quango needs to understand that the public do n’t want the cost of @entity55 to go up any further			0
’ polling commissioned by @entity26 found that two in three people thought the proposed salary of £ 74,000 was too high			2
the main party leaders have all made their opposition to the rise clear , but many backbench mps appear to back the change			1
speaking on @entity22 ’s @entity21 show , mr @entity2 reiterated that he did not believe it should be implemented			0
he added : ‘ i do n’t think it ’s acceptable at a time when there ’s continuing pay restraint in the public sector that @entity5 would receive such a big increase			1
but this is not the final verdict , this is not the final report			1
there will be a report after the election , and that ’s when we ’re going to have to tackle this issue			0
’ the plans were confirmed by new @entity26 chief executive @entity82 in his first interview , in which he claimed @entity5 should not be paid a ‘ miserly amount ’			2
he said : ‘ all the evidence points towards @entity5 ’ salaries having fallen behind			2
’ the failure to pay ‘ fair ’ rates would make it harder to recruit good candidates for @entity91 , he told the @entity92 , adding : ‘ this is an important job , the job of an mp			0
they are there to represent us all , to form laws , to send young people to war			0
‘ it is not an easy thing to do			0
we want to have good people doing the job and they need to be paid fairly			0
now , that ’s not paid in excess but it ’s not being paid a miserly amount either			0
‘ there are lots of professionals in public life and in the private sector who earn a lot more than that – so it is not an excessive amount of money at all			0
’ @entity5 are already due a 1 per cent increase to £ 67,731 next april and unless ministers step in it will go up again a month later to £ 74,000			1
mr @entity82 insisted a change in the law would be needed to prevent @entity26 following through with its proposals			0
@entity125 , secretary - general of the @entity127 union , said the announcement of the proposed pay rise left him furious , adding : ‘ very few things make me angry but i have got to admit the anger i felt when i heard that			1
’ he said the @entity134 pay - review body was pressured to recommend just 1 per cent , in line with pay - restraint policy , but ministers refused to pay even that , adding : ‘ now we find there are moves to pay mps far in excess of anything @entity55 service workers may expect to receive			2
