a slideshow presentation shown to @entity2 recruits classifies @entity3 , including both evangelicals and @entity5 , as religious extremists , placing them in the same category as skinheads , the @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11			2
the presentation also warned that members of the military are prohibited from taking leadership roles in any organization the @entity17 considers ' extremist , ' and from distributing the organization 's literature , whether on or off a military installation			1
the opening slide warns that ' the rise in hate crimes and extremism outside the military may be an indication of internal issues all [ armed ] services will have to face			2
' citing a @entity32 report as evidence that extremism is on the rise , the @entity2 presentation blames ' the superheated fears generated by economic dislocation , a proliferation of demonizing conspiracy theories , the changing racial make - up of @entity40 and the prospect of 4 more years under a black president who many on the far right view as an enemy to their country			1
' @entity47 : these groups were all lumped together in a slideshow for @entity2 recruits extremist organizations : the presentation described groups like the religious organizations as advocating force , violence or extremist causes presenters were instructed in accompanying notes to read this slide in its entirety			0
it warns that soldiers may not take leadership positions in any group the military considers ' extremist ' in nature , nor may they distribute their literature later in the slideshow is a list of groups that exemplify ' religious extremism			1
' included are ' evangelical christianity , ' ' @entity74 , ' ' ultra-orthodox ' @entity75 , and ' @entity76			0
' most of the list is populated by more widely accepted examples of religious extremist groups , including @entity11 , @entity81 , @entity10 , and the @entity9			0
' @entity82 who have served the @entity2 faithfully for centuries should n't be likened to those who have regularly threatened the peace and security of the @entity40 , ' retired col. @entity88 , executive director of the @entity89 , said in a statement			1
' it is dishonorable for any @entity40 military entity to allow this type of wrongheaded characterization			1
are @entity74 clergy like @entity96 ( @entity97 ) and racist @entity9 wizards in the same boat ? an @entity2 training presentation described both groups as examples of ' religious extremism			1
' @entity88 also took a shot at the @entity32			1
' it also appears that some military entities are using definitions of " hate " and " extreme " from the lists of @entity111 political organizations , ' he added			0
' that violates the apolitical stance appropriate for the military			0
' he noted that the @entity2 @entity116 has investigated the presentation and determined that it was ' an isolated incident not condoned by the @entity119			0
' the @entity2 presentation defines religious extremism as ' beliefs , attitudes , feelings , actions , or strategies of a character far removed from the " ordinary			2
" ' it concedes that ' ordinary ' is a subjective term , but condemns religious @entity40 ' who believe that their beliefs , customs and traditions are the only " right way " and that all others are practicing their faith the " wrong way , " seeing and believing that their faith / religion [ is ] superior to all others			2
' spot the religious extremist : the ultra-orthodox @entity142 jew ( r ) or the @entity144 ? trick question : the @entity2 includes both men 's religious movements many @entity3 and @entity149 , the presentation suggests , fit into that category , making them as objectionable as @entity152 terrorists			0
the @entity153 of the @entity116 did not immediately respond to a request for comment			0
but the @entity156 said it ' is astounded that @entity5 were listed alongside groups that are , by their very mission and nature , violent and extremist			0
' ' the @entity156 calls upon the @entity17 to review these materials , ' the organization said in a statement , ' and to ensure that tax - payer funds are never again used to present blatantly anti-religious material to the men and women in uniform			1
