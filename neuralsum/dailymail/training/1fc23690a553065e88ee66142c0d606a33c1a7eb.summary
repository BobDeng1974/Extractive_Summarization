we had gotten one in the beginning of the school year and we were all unsure as to why we were given a second			2
after closer inspection we realized that our photos had be retouched far past smoothing out blemishes			1
the student then listed what she believed had been done to the image including : face smoothing , skin recoloring , lip recoloring , eyebrow smoothing and reshaping , and face thinning the post continued : ' i was outraged ! i have a round face that i have grown to love and now i get my photo back with a different face			1
the new photo no longer even looks like me but rather a prettier twin sister			2
' when we go and have our photos taken we are flat out told that our skin will be retouched to hide blemishes			1
we are not told , however , that more drastic changes are made			2
' going to an all girls school we are constantly reminded about positive body image and accepting ourselves for who we are			0
having these changes made to make me appear thinner makes me wonder how must our school practices what they preach			2

the girl added : ' when our yearbook teacher saw the photos he was outraged along with all the other staff members of the school			0
they understood that the new edited photos are not what the students look like			1
