by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 would appear to face a fight to convince new @entity5 boss @entity4 of his worth already after playing not a minute of the club ’s opening two tour matches in @entity8			1
@entity5 continued their good pre-season form on saturday with a 3 - 2 win over @entity11 here in @entity13			1
just as he did in beating @entity15 7 - 0 last week , @entity14 played almost entirely different teams in each half at @entity18 today but @entity19 was not given a run - out			1
@entity14 has even managed to give three goalkeepers at least a half each but has n’t managed to get @entity19 on to the field			0
the former @entity38 player trained fully with his team - mates here yesterday and is not thought to be injured			0
it would appear , therefore , that he faces a battle to show @entity14 he is worth persevering with after enduring a difficult season under @entity43 last time round			2
lack of action : @entity19 is yet to play a single minute of @entity5 's @entity45 differing fortunes : @entity19 with team - mate @entity47 , who is set to see plenty of first - team action this season @entity19 was signed by sir @entity50 18 months ago but @entity43 was disappointed with his attitude and loaned him to @entity52 for the second half of last season			1
he started well enough in @entity55 but his form soon dipped and he ended the season on the bench as @entity52 were relegated from the @entity59			0
when asked about @entity29 , @entity14 said : ‘ i have a lot of strikers			2
maybe he will play centre forward next			0
he has worked well in training			0

@entity29 faces fight to convince @entity14 of his worth to @entity5
he is yet to play in a single minute of the club 's @entity45
*spent* second half of last campaign on loan at @entity52
@entity5 have beaten @entity15 7 - 0 and @entity11 3 - 2 so far in pre-season
