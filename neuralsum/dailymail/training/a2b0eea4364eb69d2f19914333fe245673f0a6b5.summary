a new season and with it comes new battles , both on the pitch and in the studios			2
in much the same way as clubs have fought for talent , the major tv channels have been battling for the best punditry talent			2
@entity11 ’s retirement has left a void at the @entity13 and @entity15 ’s arrival is being perceived as a major coup for @entity17			1
how will they fare in the shake - up ? here , @entity20 runs the rule over the punditry teams that will be discussing the action this season			2
@entity29 and @entity36 , in particular , have formed an excellent and occasionally combative partnership on @entity45 – ‘ no one grows up wanting to be a @entity29 ’ – and @entity46 does an excellent job in steering those discussions			2
@entity37 has retained greater punditry authority than just about every other player from his generation , not least because he is willing and able to criticise			2
the organisation continue to lead the way in terms of technology , succeeding far more adequately than the rest in explaining how a goal was scored , rather than simply describing what happened			2
the fact that @entity32 have made compelling viewing of @entity39 and a group of ex-pros watching tv only supports the notion that they are the most creative and effective at what they do			2
of course they stand on a bigger platform than the rest , but they press home the advantage well , only losing a modicum of credit for their understandable yet irritating over-marketing of the weaker matches			0
rating : 9/10 @entity45 : @entity36 and @entity29 are the benchmark for punditry on @entity45 end of an era : @entity11 's @entity85 career spanned three decades , @entity83 will stay on @entity13 star men : @entity87 , @entity83 , @entity88 , @entity89 the frequent and increasingly popular criticisms of the @entity13 are harsh , with @entity85 rightly retaining iconic status in an era of dedicated channels and blanket coverage			1
but has been left behind by @entity32 and @entity17 are growing rapidly			1
in spite of the challenges it faces in a ballooned market , it still offers a fine service			0
in @entity87 , they have arguably the best anchor of all , while @entity88 is one of the few former players who can match the @entity32 group for analysis			0
@entity106 is also excellent at explaining the game , but overall the @entity13 lack the dynamism of @entity36 and @entity29			0
perhaps it ’s time to lose the chairs			0
@entity83 continues to get generous allocations for contributions that rarely offer significant insight , though he is improving			0
and @entity89 is more eloquent and sharper than his class clown image			0
the @entity13 have taken strides to freshen the image of its football such as filtering in some new faces like @entity106 , who should get more airtime , but still lag some way behind @entity32			0
rating : 8/10 poor relation : @entity125 was a commentator and pundit for @entity13 during the @entity127 , it did n't go well @entity128 and new : @entity37 is an old - hand at punditry but @entity15 is relatively new on the scene @entity132 star men : @entity25 , @entity134 , @entity15 @entity132 retain the ultimate love - or - hate anchor in @entity136			1
to some he is simply unbearable , for reasons largely lost on this reporter			0
to others , he is recognised as a professional broadcaster from a broadcaster ’s background who tries to inject a modicum of humour into the dreadfully serious world of football			0
@entity134 is a superb analyst and supplements the broadcasts , but @entity149 ’s return to coaching will be a blow , not least because of the absence of his aggression			0
the will - he , wo n’t - he saga over the possibility of a punch to @entity25 has now all but disappeared			0
signing @entity15 for @entity157 matches is also a major coup			1
@entity15 ’s open criticisms of @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 have stunned viewers of his panel work and readers of his @entity167 blog			1
rating : 7/10 @entity169 : people seem to either love or hate @entity25 , seen here trying to cool down in @entity172 @entity173 star men : @entity175 , @entity15 , @entity176 , @entity177 @entity175 is an excellent anchor and around him a solid team is starting to develop			1
signing @entity15 from under @entity32 ’s clutches was a brilliant coup , while @entity176 will do sporadic work and is always box office			1
the @entity185 boss will be able to appear in competitions which @entity185 no longer feature in , which could mean next month ’s @entity188 between @entity189 and @entity190			0
@entity177 is not to everyone ’s taste , but he speaks from a position of tremendous authority on the current game and is improving			1
what excites most is that @entity17 are doing something different , not only in the sense that they offer a wider coverage than the terrestrial channels , but also in their studio gimmicks			1
while the @entity13 have their sofa , @entity17 will get @entity203 and @entity204 to deliver a free - kick masterclass on their indoor studio pitch			1
it ’s a bit clunky , but early days … rating : @entity209 @entity210 : @entity173 with @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 and @entity204 opinionated : @entity176 is bound to cause controversy considering how much air - time he will be given			1

@entity11 has retired from @entity85
@entity173 have signed @entity177 and @entity176
@entity15 will work for @entity132 on the @entity157 and @entity17 on @entity219
