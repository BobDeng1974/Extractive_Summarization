health risk : painkillers used by millions of @entity2 have been linked to higher risk of irregular heartbeat that could trigger a stroke painkillers used by millions of @entity2 have been linked to higher risk of irregular heartbeat that could trigger a stroke			1
the extra chance of developing atrial fibrillation is as high as 84 per cent , @entity9 researchers say			1
the condition – a leading cause of first - time strokes – means the upper chambers of the heart are out of rhythm and beat much faster than normal , which allows blood to pool and clot			1
at least seven million @entity2 with arthritis take prescription painkillers , including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) such as diclofenac and ibuprofen , and newer medication called coxibs			1
in the study , the heart health of 8,423 people aged 55 and older was tracked since 1990 in @entity32			1
cases of atrial fibrillation were diagnosed using heart tracer recordings , while the details of drugs prescribed were gathered from pharmacies			2
the average age of the study participants was 68 , and just over half were women , says a report in the online journal @entity45			0
during the average monitoring period of just under 13 years , 857 participants developed atrial fibrillation			0
of these 261 had never used nsaids when they were diagnosed , while 554 had used nsaids in the past , and 42 were currently taking these drugs			0
current use was associated with a 76 per cent greater risk of atrial fibrillation than for those who had never taken nsaids			2
age , sex and underlying heart problems were taken into account			0
use of the painkillers within the preceding 30 days was linked to an 84 per cent greater risk of atrial fibrillation			1
while there was a trend for higher doses to be linked to higher atrial fibrillation risk , the finding was not statistically significant			2
anti-inflammatory : at least seven million @entity2 with arthritis take prescription painkillers , including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) such as diclofenac and ibuprofen ( pictured ) it is thought nsaids may contribute to heart rhythm problems by increasing blood pressure as a result of fluid retention			1
@entity78 , of the @entity79 in @entity32 , said previous research had thrown up a link between atrial fibrillation and these painkillers			2
‘ our results also suggest that the increased risk occurs shortly after starting treatment and may disappear over time , ’ he added			2
nsaids work by blocking the @entity90 enzyme which reduces pain and inflammation , but is also important in regulating heart function			0
there were 17million prescriptions for @entity88 in the @entity2 in 2010			2
@entity96 can be bought from pharmacists and supermarkets , along with @entity100 tablets containing diclofenac but at far lower doses than on prescription			0
around ten years ago the anti-arthritis drug @entity105 was voluntarily taken off the market because of an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes			1
professor @entity111 , of the clinical trial service unit and epidemiological studies unit at @entity113 , said : ‘ this study is consistent with previous reports indicating that some @entity88 increase the risk of atrial fibrillation			1
‘ atrial fibrillation is just one of several cardiac hazards associated with @entity88 , the most important of which is an increased risk of heart attacks			1
on sale : there were 17million prescriptions for @entity88 in the @entity2 in 2010			0
@entity96 can be bought from pharmacists and supermarkets , along with @entity100 tablets ( pictured ) containing diclofenac ‘ although nsaids are very effective for the treatment of pain , it is important that both risks and benefits are considered carefully before they are prescribed			0
’ @entity113 researchers last year found that high doses of @entity88 can increase the risk of heart attacks , strokes and heart failure			1
their study confirmed the existence of a ‘ small but significant ’ extra risk of dying from heart problems after prolonged use			1
the research , published in @entity146 medical journal , found naproxen was the safest nsaid			0
researchers looked at the highest doses of painkillers prescribed by doctors , twice the daily amount recommended for headache and other minor ailments			0
they said a short course of tablets bought over the counter for a muscle sprain was unlikely to be hazardous			0
the study pooled the findings from 639 trials after numerous small trials showed a link between nsaids and heart side effects .			0
