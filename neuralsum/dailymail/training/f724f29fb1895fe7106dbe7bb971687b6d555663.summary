but speculation was mounting yesterday as to whether sunday night ’s bright full moon had triggered the duchess ’s first contractions			1
while most will say nature had simply run its course , some believe the theory that suggests the moon ’s gravitational pull can influence embryonic fluid around a child in the womb in much the same way as it affects the tide			1
mother nature : theories as to what kick - started the @entity26 of @entity28 's labour include the lunar cycle and the weather @entity31 , of the @entity32 , said colleagues often talk of how a full moon makes for a busy spate of deliveries			1
while she acknowledged any evidence was purely anecdotal , she said : ‘ midwives usually do say “ i ’m on call			0
it ’s a full moon			2
i ’ll be busy tonight ”			0

some believe an electrical storm above @entity86 may also have had an effect , with thunder and lightning and isolated showers in @entity91 at 6am yesterday			1
@entity92 : some believe that the moon 's gravitational pull can affect the embryonic fluid around an unborn child and bring on contractions @entity99 , a midwife of 20 years said : ‘ there ’s a pressure around the baby in the uterus			1
there ’s change from a high atmosphere to a suddenly low one when a storm comes and the difference in pressure is what the uterus is trying to equal , so your waters can break			0
