the @entity1 has been an irrelevance to many clubs in recent years – but given the lack of success for most sides in the fifth - round draw , @entity0 could be the greatest day out for a whole generation of fans			2
the weekend exits of @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and recent @entity16 winners @entity15 have given some sleeping giants a real sniff of success at last			0
if you take out the three favourites – @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 – none of the other 17 clubs left have won a major trophy between them in 10 years			1
@entity29 players celebrate after beating @entity12 4 - 2 in the @entity1 at @entity30 @entity31 of @entity29 celebrates after scoring his team 's second goal on saturday @entity35 striker @entity34 celebrates after scoring for his side against @entity11 fourteen of the clubs , 70 per cent of those left in the draw , have n’t won a league championship , @entity1 or @entity16 this century			1
more than half have n’t lifted major silverware for 40 years and seven clubs pre-date the @entity44			2
@entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 have never won a trophy			1
there are some pretty big names who have waited a long time			0
none of the @entity55 players who will face @entity56 in the fifth round were alive when their team won the @entity1 in 1980			2
@entity59 came from behind to beat nine - man @entity15 3 - 1 in their @entity1 fourth round clash 1 year – @entity21 ( 2014 @entity1 ) 2 years – @entity22 ( 2013 @entity62 ) 3 years – @entity23 ( 2012 @entity16 ) 11 years – @entity35 ( 2004 @entity16 ) 13 years – @entity59 ( 2002 @entity16 ) 15 years – @entity63 ( 2000 @entity16 ) 19 years – @entity64 ( 1996 @entity16 ) 35 years – @entity55 ( 1980 @entity1 ) 40 years – @entity65 ( 1975 @entity66 ) 42 years – @entity67 ( 1973 @entity1 ) 43 years – @entity68 ( 1972 @entity16 ) 47 years – @entity56 ( 1968 @entity1 ) 57 years – @entity69 ( 1958 @entity1 ) 75 years – @entity70 ( 1938 @entity1 ) 90 years – @entity71 ( 1925 @entity1 ) 104 years – @entity29 ( 1911 @entity1 ) no major trophies – @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity45 @entity45 's on - loan striker @entity73 celebrates during the the @entity1 win against @entity14 @entity56 fans have to be even older to remember winning a cup			1
their @entity1 triumph in 1968 was so long ago , manager @entity79 was still a 10 - year - old in short trousers			0
@entity67 have spent the last 42 years trying to emulate their legendary @entity1 - winning heroes of 1973			0
yet they are serial winners compared to fourth - round replay opponents @entity46 , who have never won a major prize , or prospective fifth - round opponents @entity29			1
they reached the @entity16 final a couple of years ago but for actually winning something , you have to rewind to 1911			0
@entity22 were held to a goalless draw with @entity48 in their tie at @entity95 @entity96 ( centre ) celebrates equalising for @entity63 as they dumped @entity13 out of the @entity1 outside the big three , @entity35 are the most recent trophy winners , collecting the @entity16 in 2004 under @entity99			0
fifth - round opponents @entity63 and @entity64 have also won the @entity16 in living memory but they were some time ago ; 2000 and 1996 respectively			2
it will give everyone an extra buzz when fifth - round weekend comes around			0
and remember only two of the managers left have only won a big trophy in @entity108 football – @entity109 at @entity21 , and the aforementioned @entity99 , now in charge of @entity65 who face @entity47 .			1

@entity62 *top* three were all knocked out by lower - league opposition
