the divorce of engineering and property tycoon @entity12 , 72 , and @entity14 , 63 , has set mother against son and brother against sister in the @entity19			1
lawyers have already clocked up £ 1million in fees in what mrs @entity22 says is her principled fight to make sure that her ‘ old - fashioned patriarch ’ husband does not financially favour their son , @entity27 , 36 , over herself and their daughters			1
battle : @entity22 has won a £ 50m fight with her estranged husband @entity32 over their divorce judge @entity35 said : ‘ no - one could fail to observe , and to be dismayed and saddened , by the fact that , after 43 years of marriage , this couple ’s divorce has involved not only themselves but their adult children			1
’ and mr @entity12 ’s mental health had gone into such decline that he had at one point been compulsorily committed to a mental hospital			2
@entity47 , 40 , and @entity48 , 39 , had tried to play down their brother ’s success in running the @entity52 - based business , @entity46 , said the judge			0
and mrs @entity22 had suggested that her son was being ‘ opportunistic ’ in supporting his father ’s case against her			2
legal battle : @entity22 has battled her husband over £ 50m at the @entity19 in @entity59 in a preliminary success for mrs @entity22 , the judge ruled that her husband ’s controlling shareholding in the company – by far his largest asset – must go into the pot for division between them in their divorce			1
despite paying tribute to father - of - four @entity27 for his role in rescuing the company from a crisis in 2002 and re-building it , the judge ruled that , primarily for tax reasons , mr @entity12 had never categorically agreed that he held his shares in trust for his son			1

’ @entity99 has told the @entity100 he is looking at fighting the decision			0
he said : ‘ i ’m obviously disappointed in the result and , together with my legal team , am considering an appeal			0
' i would like to stress that the company will not be affected by what is effectively a private , family dispute that has unfortunately been played out in public			0

@entity32 and @entity22 are divorcing after a 43 - year marriage
she would lose out on millions if the family fortune is passed to their son
the divorce battle could *prevent* her daughters getting share of £ 50m pot
it is *claimed* mr @entity12 is an ' old fashioned patriarch ' favouring his son
legal costs have already topped the £ 1million mark in the @entity19 battle
judge @entity35 has appealed for an end to the ' untold misery '
