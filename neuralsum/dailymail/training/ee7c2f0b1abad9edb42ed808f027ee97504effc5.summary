in his first major show of philanthropy , @entity1 founder @entity0 made a splash by announcing his plan to give $ 100million to help turn around @entity6 , @entity8 's public schools in an appearance on @entity10 in 2010			1
but nearly four years later , @entity0 's money has run out , having been spent mostly on labor contracts and consulting fees with no noticeable improvement in student performance , a report in the @entity12 reveals			1
' everybody 's getting paid , but @entity22 still ca n't read , ' @entity18 , the president of the @entity19 of @entity20 , told the magazine			2
change : @entity1 founder @entity0 pledged $ 100million dollars to help @entity6 , @entity8 public schools in 2010 but the money is mostly gone and the schools are n't any better big check : @entity0 announced the plan with then - @entity6 mayor @entity29 and governor @entity30 on the @entity10 show in 2010 then - mayor @entity29 came up with the plan to bring cutting - edge educational reform to his city in 2010			1
he saw a way to bring rapid change through philanthropic donations , which require no public reviews on spending , and governor @entity30 got on board			2
the program 's largest donor was @entity0 , who even admitted to @entity29 that he did n't know much about education reform or philanthroy			0
@entity0 's conditions were that @entity29 find other donors to match his contribution and hire a new ' transformational leader ' as superintendent			0
@entity49 was eventaully selected as superintendent , but the job of turning @entity6 's schools into ' a symbol of excellence for the whole nation ' has not been easy			1
' this is 16 - dimensional chess , ' @entity55 said			0
complicated : @entity49 was chosen as @entity6 's new superintendent but has had a hard time making changes , describing the work as ' 16 - dimensional chess ' @entity0 's money has mostly gone into the early stages of overhaul , paying consultants upwards of $ 1,000 a day to find solutions to @entity6 public schools ' problems			1
according to the report , between 2010 and 2012 ' more than twenty million dollars of @entity0 's gift and matching donations went to consulting firms and various specialities : public relations , human resources , communications , data analysis , [ and ] teacher evaluations			1
' and the plans for overhaul did not settle well with @entity6 parents , who were informed that many of the schools would be closed and replaced with charter schools			1
@entity55 's plan , titled ' one @entity6 ' , is the latest iteration of how to change the schools			1
it offers familes the ability to chose between 55 public schools and 16 charter schools to send their children to , with low - income familes and those with special - needs students getting first pick			2
but there are still several flaws with the plan , such as the fact that it does n't include funds to provide transportation for students			0
the author took a walk with some @entity6 parents , tracing the route their daughter would take to a potential new school , down streets of boarded - up homes occupied by gangs			1
' i will not allow my daughter to make this walk , ' @entity113 said			0
' my twenty - eight - year - old started off in a gang , and we fought to get him out			0
my twenty - two - year - old has a lot of anger issues because @entity122 was nâ€™t there			0
i just refuse to see another generation go that way			0
' and now there are fears that the plan will be slowed since @entity129 , @entity6 's new mayor as of tuesday night , has been an outspoken opponent to the plan			2
meanwhile , the two people that championed the plan have all but abandoned the @entity6 problem			2
@entity29 has since gone to @entity135 as a @entity8 senator and governor @entity30 is busy repairing his reputation after @entity138			0
it 's unclear if @entity0 will offer additional funds .			0

the @entity1 founder pledged $ 100million to @entity6 schools in 2010 to bring *sweeping* educational reforms
however , most of the money has been spent on labor contracts and consulting fees
the money has had little impact on student performance so far
