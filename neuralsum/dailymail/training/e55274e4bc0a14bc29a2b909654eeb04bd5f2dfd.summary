a college basketball contest was repeatedly delayed saturday by - of all things - a swooping bat that inexplicably gained entree into the arena and then again - and - again dive - bombed the court			1
pandemonium erupted at the @entity7 in downtown @entity8 , @entity9 during the game 's second half after the flying critter emerged from the building 's rafters and reportedly proceeded to harry panicked players and coaches with repeated kamikaze - like swoops			1
' it 's coming back ! it 's coming back ! ' a fan can be overheard exclaiming to a pal on a widely - circulated @entity23 video of the incident			0
oh my @entity52 ! it 's crazy ! he 's making another swoop ! he 's making another swoop ! oh my @entity52 ! ' @entity34 coach @entity43 , meanwhile , swatted at the marauding bat with a clipboard , while his players , as well as those from competing @entity33 , futilely tossed towels at the obviously - distressed animal			1
oh my @entity52 ! it 's crazy ! he 's making another swoop ! he 's making another swoop ! oh my @entity52 ! ' spectators joined attempts to corral the critter , gleefully hurling jackets and articles of clothing at the bat from the stands , all of it missing and littering the suddenly - muddled court			0
meanwhile , the arena 's public address announcer utilized the bat 's presence to riff on an aging rocker 's one - time antics			0
as players and referees wildly dove for cover from the animal 's repeated plunges , @entity33 's public address announcer played ' @entity96 ' by @entity97 , who infamously once tore the head off of a bat with his teeth during a concert , the @entity89 reported			1
look out : the moment a bat emerges from the rafters during a basketball game saturday and swoops down at a panicked @entity106 player @entity107 : the @entity34 player dodges the nose - diving bat , stumbling backwards as if he had just drawn a charge easy does it : after stumbling backwards , the shocked @entity34 player loses his balance in the face of the swooping bat brace yourself : the @entity34 player finally tumbles backwards on to his bottom as the bat sews pandemonium among the other players on the court after delaying the game numerous times to no avail , officials finally dimmed the arena 's lights with 7:36 left to play in last - ditch effort to calm the bat			1
the @entity97 ode reportedly gave way to a @entity133 song on the public address system , according to one media account , as fans waved cell phones in the dark , as if paying an homage at a concert			0
after that , the game finally resumed without incident , and @entity33 went on to prevail 81 - 71			2
it appeared that the bat might play a decisive role in the outcome of the closely - contested meeting between the two schools			0
quick - witted : the public address official utilized the bizarre moment to play @entity97 's ' @entity96 ' in an apparent ode to the rocker 's once biting off a bat 's head to corral a bat : as @entity97 's ' @entity96 ' roared on the arena 's @entity159 , players threw towels at the swooping bat , and spectators hurled jackets on to the court @entity33 reportedly held a 58 - 42 advantage with 11:23 left in the second half when the bat initially started madly swooping around the arena			1
as play was delayed several times over the game 's next four minutes of play , @entity34 managed to cut the lead to 61 - 55			2
@entity33 claimed the contest as a home game , as the school , as well as the @entity40 @entity8 , compete in the @entity7 , which is named after a local bank			2
the presence of the unusual arena denizen could be a product of the arena 's advancing age , as it was reportedly - and officially - opened to the public on october 1 , 1988			0
the so - called ' @entity7 ' is now one of the oldest arenas in use by an @entity40 team .			0
