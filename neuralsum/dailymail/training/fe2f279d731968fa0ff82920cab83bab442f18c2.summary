what started out as a heart - warming tale about the kindness of strangers and the love of a man and his dog , has turned into a war of words and impending lawsuit			0
@entity10 , from @entity11 , @entity12 , had his impounded dog returned to him due to the actions of shelter photographer @entity15 - who posted a heartbreaking picture of the separated pair on @entity18 in a bid to raise money to have the dog released			1
donations flooded in and @entity10 was reunited with @entity23 earlier this week			1
but now , he has allegedly repaid the favor by threatening to sue @entity15 for embezzlement , slander and grand larceny			1
when he was released from prison , he could not afford the $ 400 fees to have the two - year - old pit bull mix released from its cage at the shelter			1
when he visited his pooch , he weeped as he fed @entity23 water and @entity49 , and stroked his paw through the cage			0
when ms @entity15 saw the exchange , she took pictures and posted them on @entity18			1
not only was the $ 400 for the release fee raised , but an extra $ 1,600 on top			1
because @entity10 , 36 , did not leave his details at the pound , ms @entity15 went out of her way to find him , posting fliers all over the local area and appealing for help online			1
she finally tracked him down on monday evening and a highly emotional and relieved mr @entity10 was reunited with his beloved buzz the following day			2
now , however , @entity10 has threatened to sue @entity15 for not handing over the rest of the cash left over from the donations after the shelter fee was covered			1
in a voice mail allegedly left by @entity10 , he tells her : ' you are dead wrong and i will be getting in touch with the lawyer and if you do anything with my money that is slander one , embezzlement two … what ’s the other one ? oh grand larceny because it ’s over $ 1,000			1
' ms @entity15 posted the phone call on @entity83 and defended herself			2
despair : mr @entity10 , 36 , did n't have the funds to release his dog before he was pictured by a @entity88 animal lover overwhelmed : it took days to track down mr @entity10 who was extremely emotional when he realized that strangers had donated to have him reunited with his dog she wrote : ' @entity10 has called to inform them that i am keeping the money raised for his dog			1
i have transferred $ 842.07 into my bank to reimburse myself for the shelter fees , vet and @entity99 shopping spree that i put onto my personal credit card			2
' i had a discussion regarding the remainder of the donations and how he would like to spend them			0
i asked if he had any bills that were due at the time			0
i told him that every dime that was donated would go to him and @entity23 , but that i would not be giving him the cash			0
' i explained to him that the money that was donated was a blessing for him , i wanted to be sure that we respected that and used the donations responsibly			0
he sat next to me and nodded his head , not one response , question or concern			0
' she then revealed she was going to return the money to those who donated or else give it to an animal shelter			2
' i have been reimbursed for all expense to rescue @entity23 from the high kill @entity125 and reunite him with his owner @entity10 , ' she added			2
' there are donations leftover			0
the donations will not go to @entity10 after the stunt he has pulled			0
if you still want @entity10 to have your donation , i will have to ask you to send it to him personally			0
' no good deed goes unpunished , right ? '			0

@entity10 , from @entity12 , was jailed for a few days for traffic violations and his dog @entity23 , a *pitbull* mix , taken away
@entity15 raised money to help him pay the $ 400 pound fees and the pair were reunited
raised $ *2,000* all together , some of which went to shelter and vet fees
ms @entity15 said she would give leftover money to @entity10
he has repaid her by threatening to sue for slander , embezzlement and larceny
