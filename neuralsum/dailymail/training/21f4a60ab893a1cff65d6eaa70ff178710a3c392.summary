by @entity0 published : 10:28 est , 4 april 2013 updated : 10:29 est , 4 april 2013 astronomers have watched as a black hole woke up from a decades - long slumber to feed on a nearby giant planet			2
the discovery in galaxy @entity6 , 47 million light - years away , was made by @entity9 's integral space observatory			1
a similar feeding event , albeit on a gas cloud , will soon happen at the black hole at the centre of our own @entity15 , astronomers say			0
the flaring event in @entity6 can be seen as a warm - up act for a similar event expected in the supermassive black hole at the centre of our own @entity15 , perhaps even this year			1
while there are no brown dwarfs or planets on the menu this time , a compact cloud of gas amounting to just a few @entity33 masses has been seen spiralling towards the black hole and is predicted to meet its fate soon			0
' the observation was completely unexpected , from a galaxy that has been quiet for at least 20 – 30 years , ' says @entity41 of the @entity42 , @entity43 , lead author of the paper in @entity46			1
astronomers were using @entity48 to study a different galaxy when they noticed a bright @entity51 flare coming from another location in the same wide field - of - view			2
using @entity56 , the origin was confirmed as @entity6 , a galaxy never before detected at high @entity58 with @entity59 and @entity60 , the emission was traced from its maximum in january 2011 , when the galaxy brightened by a factor of a thousand , and then as it subsided over the course of the year			1
by analysing the characteristics of the flare , the astronomers could determine that the emission came from a halo of material around the galaxy 's central black hole as it tore apart and fed on an object of 14 – 30 @entity74 masses			2
this size range corresponds to brown dwarfs , substellar objects that are not massive enough to fuse hydrogen in their core and ignite as stars			0
however , the authors note that it could have had an even lower mass , just a few times that of @entity74 , placing it in the range of gas - giant planets			0
the black hole in the centre of @entity6 is estimated to have a mass of around 300 000 times that of our own @entity91 @entity6 4845 , a spiral galaxy some 47 million light - years away where astronomers have spotted a black hole taking a snack it also likes to play with its food : the way the emission brightened and decayed shows there was a delay of 2 – 3 months between the object being disrupted and the heating of the debris in the vicinity of the black hole			1
' this is the first time where we have seen the disruption of a substellar object by a black hole , ' adds co-author @entity112 of the @entity113 , @entity114			0
' we estimate that only its external layers were eaten by the black hole , amounting to about 10 % of the object 's total mass , and that a denser core has been left orbiting the black hole			0
