staff and visitors at @entity4 's @entity3 campus were given a treat this week as the company took its driverless car prototype for a spin			1
the technology is still undergoing tests , and the firm has n't announced when exactly the vehicles will become an addition to public roads because engineers are still ironing out a number of issues			1
but , that has n't stopped the project 's director @entity19 and his team demonstrating its potential to fans in @entity24			2
staff and visitors at @entity4 's @entity3 campus were given a treat this week as the company showed off its driverless car prototype ( pictured )			1
the technology is still undergoing tests , and the firm has n't announced when the vehicles will become common place on our roads as engineers are still ironing out issues mr @entity19 is also hopeful the cars will be roadworthy within the next five years			1
one of the features said to be delaying the car 's release is its inability to cope in heavy rain or snow			1
an insider told @entity45 that the current prototype cars are very reliant on maps to navigate and ca n’t react like a human driver , dodging potholes and other hazards			1
the latest official figures from @entity4 revealed the cars have already driven themselves for more 700,000 miles ( 1,126,540km ) , but they struggle to cope in snowy conditions and ca n't negotiate heavy rain			1
mr @entity19 said this is because the detection technology is not yet strong enough to separate certain objects from weather conditions			1
while the cars ’ cameras can spot a traffic light changing , they can be confused by strong sunlight			2
they do n’t distinguish between an empty plastic bag - which could be easily driven over - or a rock , so cars must drive around both			1
they also ca n’t detect uncovered manholes or potholes			2
mr @entity19 said : ‘ i could construct a construction zone that could befuddle the car			2
’ this graphic reveals how @entity4 's prototype driverless car looks and works			1
the car makes turns and reacts to vehicles and pedestrians based on computer programs that predict what others might do , and data from sensors including radar and cameras that read , in real - time , what other objects are actually doing the prototype two - seater cars have buttons to autonomously begin and end the drive			1
the car makes turns and reacts to vehicles and pedestrians based on computer programs that predict what others might do , and data from sensors including radar and cameras that read , in real - time , what other objects are actually doing			2
the route might be set by typing a destination into a map or using spoken commands according to @entity19 , the leader of @entity4 's self - driving car team			1
the car will be powered by electricity and could go about 100 miles ( 160 km ) before charging			2
its shape suggests a rounded - out @entity109 - something that might move people around a corporate campus or congested downtown - with headlights and sensors arrayed to resemble a friendly face			2
the front of the vehicle has a soft foam - like material where a traditional bumper would be and a more flexible windscreen , in a bid to be safer for pedestrians			0
in these prototypes speed is restricted to 25mph ( 40 km / h ) and the ability to self - drive will depend on specifically designed @entity4 road maps tested on the company ’s current fleet of vehicles			1
ultimately the vehicles will be faster and will be able to use @entity4 's extended maps service			1
driving works by using gps technology to locate the vehicle ’s exact position on an electronic map			0
a combination of radar , lasers and cameras sitting on top of the roof give the car a 360 - degree ‘ view ’ , with sensors linked to computer software able to ‘ see ’ and identify people , cars , road signs and markings and traffic lights			1
the cars ‘ see ’ pedestrians as moving blocks of pixels and know to stop , but unlike a cautious human driver , they could not spot a traffic policeman at the side of the road , waving for traffic to stop - which could lead to trouble			1
despite the cars being allowed on public roads , they need to prepare to set off in more detail than a human driver , because a precise map must be created of exactly where to go – and a car can not deviate from its route			1
an area has to be mapped multiple times by a sensor vehicle to record details such as driveways , in order to make the cars ' routes			0
these details then need to be pored over metre - by metre by humans and computers , in a much more labour - intensive process than in needed to maker @entity182			0
one of the features said to be delaying the car 's ( pictured ) release is its inability to cope in heavy rain or snow			1
an insider recently admitted that the current prototype cars are very reliant on maps to navigate and ca n’t react like a human driver , dodging potholes and other hazards			1
they also struggle in poor weather conditions despite best efforts , routes can lack details such as temporary traffic lights that have been installed , or if there are road works or potholes to avoid , which the car might drive over			1
in the @entity206 , driverless cars are only allowed on roads in certain states if someone sits in the driver 's seat			2
the @entity212 is expected to start granting licences to certain driverless cars and their human co-pilots as soon as this month			2
changes to the @entity218 @entity217 , which dates back to 1968 , are also afoot			0
it used to state : ' every driver shall at all times be able to control his vehicle or to guide his animals			0
' an amendment agreed in may would allow a car to drive itself , as long as the system ' can be overridden or switched off by the driver '			2
a driver must be present and able to take the wheel at any time			0
the convention covers @entity234 countries , @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity237 and @entity238 , although not the @entity206 , @entity239 or @entity240			0
in addition , maps have only been made for a few thousand miles of road , so in order for the cars to roam the @entity206 , @entity4 would need to pour a vast amount of resources into mapping the rest of the vast country , down to the tiniest changing detail			1
the company is working on ironing out all these problems			0
for example , if a @entity4 car notes new lights and street signs , it sends a message to update the mapping software			1
@entity4 unveiled a compact version of its car without a steering wheel , but it will now have to re-introduce the wheel to comply with the @entity212 ’ new regulations			1
despite all these set - backs , mr @entity19 said autonomous cars will ‘ happen more quickly than people think ’ – perhaps as soon as in five years ’ time			0
last month , @entity4 was awarded 25 of the first 29 permits issued by the state of @entity3 to test driverless cars on public roads			1
each permit costs $ 150 for the first vehicle , plus $ 50 for each additional vehicle , and each one must be insured for up to $ 5 million			0
self - driving cars have been undergoing private tests for at least three years , but government legislation requires permits for them to be used on public roads			2
the first licence for an autonomous vehicle was issued by @entity282 in march 2012 to a @entity283 that @entity4 modified to include its driverless technology			2
@entity4 tests its cars virually ( pictured ) as well as on real roads			1
@entity4 ’s cars have driven themselves over 700,000 miles ( 1,126,540km ) - but there is still a long way to go to hone the technology ' my test takes place in a car park at @entity4 ’s sprawling @entity24 campus – known as the @entity296 – in the heart of @entity298 , @entity3			1
' my vehicle is ‘ summoned ’ via a mobile phone			0
@entity4 ’s vision is that customers will share a driverless car which will be ordered via an app. ‘ the car will pick you up , take you where you want to go and then can go off and do errands like pick up your dry - cleaning , freeing you to do other things , ’ project director @entity305 said			2
i step inside and sink into soft @entity312 orange leather seats			0
it is surprisingly spacious , uncluttered by the normal ‘ car ’ things like pedals , a steering wheel and handbrake			0
' instead there are two buttons – green for @entity322			0
@entity323 , @entity324 , is shown in @entity4 's driverless car at the tech giant 's @entity24 campus during a test drive last month there is an oblong flatscreen in front of me which shows the time , date , temperature and a computer - generated image of the road ahead			1
beneath the high - tech screen is a storage bay for luggage			0
' i hit the @entity322 button and take off			0
the electric engine purrs into life , taking me to a top speed of 25mph ( 40km/h )			0
' the car skilfully navigates sharp turns and potential hazards of parked cars and pedestrians who wander in and out of the roadway			2
' it ‘ senses ’ corners and slows down automatically before speeding up into a straight			0
' stationary vehicles and pedestrians show up on the screen as ‘ box ’ shapes			0
' at one point we accelerate down a straight when mr @entity19 suddenly steps out in front of the car … and it automatically slams on the breaks and comes to a controlled halt			0
' it ’s eerie , impressive and utterly captivating			0
' after a few minutes it all starts to feel normal			0
as the car drives itself i open a computer and answer email			0
i become oblivious to the outside world			0
i answer my phone and do some work			0
' then i hit the @entity379 button and my journey into the future comes to a gentle halt			0

car was shown off to staff and visitors at @entity4 's @entity3 campus
@entity391 is undergoing tests , and the firm has n't announced a release date
the delay is partly blamed on the cars ' inability to drive in poor weather
current prototype is very reliant on maps and ca n't react like a human
cars are n't driven in the rain or snow as detection technology ca n't distinguish between *droplets* or flakes and *obstacles* on the road
