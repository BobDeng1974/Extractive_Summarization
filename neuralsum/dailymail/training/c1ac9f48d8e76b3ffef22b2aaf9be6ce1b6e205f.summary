by @entity0 published : 09:20 est , 3 november 2013 updated : 09:23 est , 3 november 2013 the @entity2 marathon is back , and with it is a renewed focus on security			1
taking lessons learned from the @entity8 bombings , authorities and marathon organizers have doubled down on the use of surveillance cameras , bomb sniffing dogs , scuba divers , and even counterterrorism agents			1
the heightened security , which includes almost 2,000 cameras , was announced during a friday afternoon press conference held jointly by the @entity20 and the @entity21			1
‘ this will be the best - protected race that they can enter , ’ said police commissioner @entity22			2
we 're on it : @entity2 police commissioner @entity22 ( left ) , and @entity29 ( right ) , of the @entity21 , discuss security plans for the sunday 's @entity31 the sweeping changes are part of an overhaul that doubled the marathon ’s security budget to more than $ 1million , officials said			1
of all the changes along the 26.2 - mile route , the most important is the access officials will have to almost every inch of the race and spectators should the unthinkable happen			1
in addition to hundreds of strategically positioned temporary cameras , as well as the use of permanent cameras , officials have fingered over 1,400 private - sector cameras they can access			1
‘ we are well positioned to stop it and certainly apprehend someone who 's engaged in it , ’ mr @entity22 added while surrounded by giant monitors displaying different part of the course			2
racers and spectators have been banned from wearing costumes that include masks , a tradition some have long partaken in , officials added			2
cameras galore : almost 2,000 cameras will give officials access to almost every foot of the 26.2 mile race , as displayed here above friday 's press conference extra eyes needed : security footage of the @entity8 bombing was key to identifying the accused attackers found'em ! : @entity75 officials were quickly able to make public this photo of brothers @entity79 ( left ) and ( right ) @entity80 to enlist the public 's help to hunt them down @entity75 officials were able to quickly identify and hunt down marathon bombing suspects @entity80 and @entity84 in the days after the attack , mainly a result of footage and spectator pictures made public			1
@entity2 officials met with their @entity75 counterparts in the months leading up the @entity31 to help plan security measures for sunday ’s event , the first in two years after last year 's race was cancelled in the aftermath of @entity97			1
‘ the safety and security of our runners and spectators has always been of highest priority and following the tragedy in @entity75 we ’ve taken a deeper look at what can be done to enhance those plans , ’ a race spokesperson said in a statement			1
no specific threats have been identified , but authorities are still pulling out all the stops to ensure safety for both spectators and the 45,000 - plus athletes competing in sunday ’s race			2
the most surprising moment of the press conference came when a bomb sniffing black @entity120 named @entity22 was brought in to demonstrate the effective of the 43 dogs deployed along the route			1
safe and sound : runners are screened by police officers as they arrive sunday for the 2013 @entity31 eyes everywhere police officers from the counterterrorism unit stand watch over runners who arrive at the @entity132 starting line it took @entity22 only seconds to locate a person holding a small amount of black powder in the middle of the packed briefing			1
security measures are not just limited to the ground , significant resources are being poured into the city ’s waterways as well			2
extra steps have included an unspecified number of scuba divers sweeping bridge supports for explosives , as well as police boat patrols and counterterror agents escorting runners taking the ferry to the @entity132 start line , said officials			1
divers began sweeping various sites on thursday , the commissioner noted			0
extra helicopters have also been added to an always - robust airborne security presence as well , mr @entity22 noted			1
‘ we are well equipped and well deployed , ’ said the commissioner			0
other security measures will include more rigorous bag searches , extra security guards , plain clothes officers and number of other undisclosed actions , officials added			2
even in the sky : @entity173 helicopter patrols near the @entity174 at the start of the race just one : runners have been limited to only one bag , the clear plastic one provided by the @entity21 club star of the show : @entity22 , a four - year - old @entity120 , took only seconds to find a person holding a lure during a bomb sniffing demonstration in the crowded press briefing the @entity190 is even on alert and has trained for ‘ terrorist - type activity , ’ an @entity190 spokesperson added			2
‘ people will feel a nice added measure in a way that feels supportive and not stifling , ’ race director @entity29 told @entity193			0
despite the added hassle of passing through metal detectors , being limited to only one bag and various other restrictions , most runners were in favor of the added security			0
' it will obviously cause some problems for us , but that does n't matter , ’ marathon veteran @entity204 told @entity209			0
‘ @entity210 must come first , so i gladly accept delays ... i think most runners do			0
’ mr @entity213 will be running in his 35th @entity31 , @entity209 noted			2
@entity215 , running in @entity2 for the first time , agreed			0
‘ i do n't think it affects things in a negative way , i think it just makes people on their toes and appreciate when things run smoothly , ’ she told @entity193			0
friend of @entity22 : a total of 43 bomb sniffing dogs have been deployed along the race private eyes : in addition to an increased official police presence , private security guard numbers have also been upped along the race course , including the @entity233 finish line pictured here best - laid plans : officials and runners alike feel this is the safest race they can enter another runner , @entity240 @entity239 member @entity238 , understands first - hand the importance of added security measures			1
the veteran runner finished fifth in this year ’s @entity8 , and his home country is still suffering from the fallout of september ’s @entity247 attack , which left more than 70 people dead			0
‘ it is not fun to come here and be checked when you 're coming in , ’ mr @entity238 told @entity193 , ‘ but it is something that 's a wakeup call that we live in a world that is going somewhere that we do n't like			0
’ likely speaking the minds of many , mr @entity238 added that runners are not easily scared off			0
‘ they will never defeat us			0
they will never intimidate us			0
they are targeting the wrong group of people			0
’ more than 45,000 runners stand as proof – but should the worst happen , @entity2 is ready .			0
