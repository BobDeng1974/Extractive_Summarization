by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity2 is adamant @entity3 wo n’t park the bus against @entity5 - although the loss of first - choice left - back @entity7 has now left @entity8 with a defensive headache			1
the national side open their @entity12 qualification campaign with a daunting trip to @entity14 on sunday evening			1
a full house of almost 66,000 is expected inside the @entity16 for the first competitive game played by @entity19 ’s team since they lifted the @entity20 in @entity21			1
no fear : @entity3 's @entity2 is adamant his nation will not park bus against world champions @entity5 go on a run : the @entity3 players will be hoping for a good start to their @entity12 qualifying campaign @entity30 centre - back @entity2 recognises that @entity3 must bring a perfect defensive game if they are to cope with a multi-faceted @entity34 threat			1
the chances of that have lessened , however , after the loss of talented @entity38 , who was ruled out on wednesday due to a calf injury			2
with @entity44 left - back @entity42 having been overlooked , the most likely replacement is @entity30 ’s @entity45 , while @entity46 could perhaps move from midfield to cover			1
despite the blow - and the injury to another defender , @entity48 believes head coach @entity8 will find a way for the @entity52 to achieve a result			2
‘ every team , even the world champions , will have some weaknesses , ’ said @entity2			2
‘ the coaching staff here have spent a long time looking at them and we ’ll be working on things on the training pitch			0
‘ the one thing about the manager and his staff is that they are very thorough in terms of studying teams and trying to exploit weaknesses			0
fighting fit : captain @entity70 is set to lead @entity3 against the world champions in @entity14 ‘ we all know how good @entity5 can be , so let ’s look at maybe one or two things they do n’t do so well			1
‘ we wo n’t just sit in			0
i think if you do that against a team of @entity5 ’s quality , you are on a hiding to nothing			2
it would be a very long evening			0
‘ we are going to try to impose our own game and play the way we want to play			0
‘ the manager is really positive , as are the lads			0
we have improved a lot over the past year , so we want to keep that going			0
we will have a go to try to get a result			0
’ @entity5 gave an awesome example of their attacking power in that incredible 7 - 1 demolition of @entity21 in the @entity20 semi-finals			1
‘ i sat watching that game in disbelief , probably the same as everyone else , ’ added @entity2			2
‘ it was the most one - sided game i have ever seen in the @entity20			1
‘ but one thing we are is extremely organised			0
everyone knows exactly what their defensive roles are			0
we are also getting better in attack			0
’ pointing the way : @entity3 manager @entity8 is aiming to lead his side to a positive result in @entity5 avoiding defeat in @entity14 would be an outstanding start to a @entity12 qualification campaign that offers the best chance yet of a first place at a major finals since the @entity116 98 @entity20			1
some of the @entity34 players are already uncomfortably familiar to @entity2			2
@entity118 scored twice for @entity119 in a 4 - 1 win over @entity30 last season but the defender is not cowed by the prospect of a re-match			1
‘ i ’ve played against @entity118 and @entity125 and they are top players , ’ said @entity2			2
‘ playing against them before is a bit of a help but they have good players all over the pitch			0
we wo n’t just focus on one or two			0
on the ball : midfielder @entity135 is put through his paces at @entity137 ahead of leaving for @entity5 this is how we do it : @entity135 listens as @entity3 manager @entity8 gives out instructions ‘ @entity5 have a lot of pace and power but we are used to that as we played @entity145 twice ( in the last campaign ) and they had that , too			1
‘ there are still weaknesses and we must exploit that			0
we have some real strengths and need to be positive			0
’ meanwhile , @entity7 , who has impressed since his summer switch the @entity153 from @entity154 , took to social media on wednesday night to express his anguish at missing out on facing the @entity34			1
@entity7 , who expects to be fit for @entity38 ’s next league match at home on september 15 , tweeted : ‘ gutted to be injured but hopefully back for @entity159 ! good luck to all the boys			1
’ prize guys : ( from left ) @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 won the @entity20 earlier this summer humbled : but @entity5 were beaten 4 - 2 by @entity167 in @entity168 on wednesday in a @entity20 final rematch			1

@entity2 is adamant @entity3 will not sit back against @entity5
manager @entity8 has defensive headache due to *key* injuries
first - choice left - back @entity7 has been ruled out of the game
@entity3 face @entity5 at @entity16 in @entity14 on sunday night
it will be @entity5 's first competitive match since lifting the @entity20
@entity5 lost 4 - 2 to @entity167 at home in re-run of final on wednesday
