a £ 13,000 coffee maker , a £ 10,400 pinball machine and a £ 6,500 set of stones from @entity4 are just three of the high - value items @entity6 is putting up for sale in time for @entity8			1
but this year the @entity10 auction house will break with tradition and sell the 42 lots at a fixed price - offering shoppers the chance to bypass bidding and walk away with their big - ticket gifts immediately			1
the new approach to buying , called ' @entity18 ' , is a first in @entity6 's 250 - year history and will offer customers a service similar to the ' @entity23 offered by online auction giant @entity24			1
pricey playtime : this vintage 1962 pinball machine can be bought outright for £ 10,400 at @entity6 , @entity10 most expensive : this coffee maker , left , will cost £ 13,000 and this large @entity28 from the cretaceous period ( right ) is available to buy at @entity6 for £ 2,080 from 14 november to 3 december unusual gift : this group of @entity4 chloromelanite ceremonial stone adze blades or obligation stones can be bought outright , online or in their @entity35 showroom , for £ 6,500 shoppers will be able to take a look at the selection of the out - of - the - ordinary gifts , both online and in their showroom in @entity35 , @entity10 , between 14 november and 3 december			1
and while each item , hand - picked by experts at the auction house , is priced at more than its auction estimate - shoppers willing to pay the premium will be able to buy without the competition and unpredictability of auction			2
any lots that are not bought outright in the three - week period will then go into the ' interiors ' auction on 9 december - where they will be on offer for their auction estimates			0
@entity58 , chairman of @entity6 's @entity35 , said : ' for the first time at @entity6 , buyers can secure a handpicked item for a fixed price – they do n't have to bid ; they can walk in and walk out of @entity6 with their purchase , or buy on our website			0
' new approach : with ' @entity68 ' shoppers will be able to immediately walk away with this pair of fossilised giant deer or ' @entity73 elk ' antlers circa 10,500 - 5,700 b.c. for £ 10,400 , rather than wait for auction fine jewellery : an 18th century white gold and diamond ring , left , is on offer for £ 3,900 and this @entity80 quartz watch ( left ) can be bought for £ 5,200 exotic earrings : this pair of @entity84 gold earrings , from @entity85 , 19th century , will cost £ 3,250 he added that ' @entity18 ' should appeal to those new to auction and @entity6 's regulars			2
among the more unusual items up for sale are a striking pair of fossilised giant deer or ' @entity73 elk ' antlers , which date back to roughly 10,500 and 5,700 b.c. time for something special : a @entity97 gilt - brass @entity96 will be available to buy for £ 1,040 foodies might be drawn to a pair of novelty silver salt shakers from the @entity102 era which a @entity6 's specialist promises ' would be the perfect addition to anyone ’s dinner table '			2

the specialist added that the shakers , which are housed in a velvet - lined case , ' would make a universally entertaining gift			0
’ the most expensive lot up for sale is a £ 13,000 coffee machine which ' epitomises 1930s style and would look wonderful in a contemporary kitchen , ' according to another @entity6 's specialist			1
it is followed by a 1962 pinball machine - on sale for £ 10,400 - which offers ' unbeatable ' entertainment			1
mr @entity58 said that his top pick is the taxidermy dog - a @entity130 spitz from the late @entity102 era that is mounted in a glass case			0
the dog , which has a gold ribbon died around its neck , is on sale for £ 1,950			0
mr @entity58 said : ' recently taxidermy has been enjoying a renaissance in interior design and contemporary art and i think this piece is really cool – i ’m even planning to have my own dog @entity144 the black @entity145 mounted on wheels with a push bar for my grandchildren when his time comes ! ’			0
