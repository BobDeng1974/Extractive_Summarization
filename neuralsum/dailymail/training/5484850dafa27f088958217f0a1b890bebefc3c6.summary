the @entity10 stalwart will go under the knife next month			2
her husband @entity6 has been on medication since his own kidneys began to deteriorate more than eight years ago			1
he praised the bravery of his wife and other donors in selflessly ‘ putting their life on the line ’ by volunteering for major surgery to help others			1
mrs @entity2 , 57 , joked : ‘ we ’ve only been married 18 months			1
i thought he was marrying me because of my cosy little cottage in the country , it turns out he was after my spare parts			0
’ the pair met six years ago and married in summer 2011 , just a few months before mr @entity6 learned he needed a kidney transplant			1
he said his kidneys had been in ‘ slow decline ’ since he had a stroke eight years ago and last year he was told they had deteriorated so much that he would need regular dialysis if a transplant donor was not found			2
mrs @entity2 , a @entity10 newsreader and continuity announcer since 1991 , said she had no hesitation over becoming his donor			1
she said on @entity10 ’s @entity40 : ‘ i ’ve always felt quite ambivalent about donor cards , one of those people who thinks it ’s something i ought to do but never quite got around to it			0
' i knew very little about dialysis			0
i just knew how incredibly disruptive it is and how going into hospital three times a week for three or four hours just turns your life upside down			0
‘ so , as soon as all this got talked about , i thought transplant is the way we have got to go if we can			0
’ mrs @entity2 laughed off suggestions she was ‘ wonderful and selfless ’			2
she said : ‘ i ’m doing it for very selfish reasons , i ’m doing it to preserve my life and @entity6 ’s life and our life together			1
’ two teams of surgeons will operate next month			0
one will remove mrs @entity2 ’s left kidney and it will be cooled and cleaned before the second team transplant it into mr @entity6			1
risk : the @entity10 presented has said she knows the procedure is ' serious ' but expects to be back to work in six weeks mrs @entity2 said she knew it was ‘ a serious operation ’ and added : ‘ i ’m not underestimating it , but the recovery period is very short , i will be back at work probably in six weeks and i ’m hoping to go skiing in march			2
’ consultant transplant surgeon @entity80 said organ donations between couples had become more common because advances in immune - suppressing medication meant an exact tissue match was no longer needed			0
mr @entity80 , of the @entity86 in @entity87 , said waiting lists for transplants meant patients without donors could wait for years for a kidney			2
he added : ‘ there ’s between 6,500 and 7,000 people who are on the waiting list and only just over 2,000 a year get a transplant			0
