by @entity0 after citing the heat as a contributing factor in their loss to @entity6 , @entity1 were again sweating it out on sunday ahead of their decisive group d match against @entity10			1
that clash on tuesday in @entity12 , which will decide the second team to go through to the round of 16 with @entity6 after @entity16 's elimination , will be in similar conditions and another 1pm local time kick - off			1
midfielder @entity20 claimed the @entity21 were at a disadvantage due to the ' crazy heat ' in @entity24 in @entity25 , where a header from @entity6 's @entity27 was enough to hand them a defeat			1
but with tuesday 's clash just north of @entity25 in the coastal city of @entity12 set to be no different coach @entity32 had his side out in the heat of the day in preparation for the match they must win or draw			1
@entity38 and @entity10 set for crucial @entity40 clash cooling down : @entity41 pours water over his head in a bid to turn down the temperature in @entity12 sweating it : @entity1 claimed the heat in their match against @entity6 was a factor , but tuesday will be the same preparations : @entity52 is the man in the middle during training in @entity12 ahead of their clash with @entity10 @entity38 captain @entity56 admits the 1 - 0 loss to @entity6 was draining , both physically and emotionally after they only just beat @entity16 courtesy of a @entity52 header			1
' of course this time we have to carry the loss to @entity6 as baggage and that could make it seem tougher than it is , ' @entity56 said			1
their place in the tournament is nothing new for @entity56 , who is the third player to be part of five @entity73 squads along with @entity74 great @entity76 and former @entity77 goalkeeper @entity75			1
' it 's really not that bad of a situation , ' @entity56 said sunday			2
' this is the 10th tournament i 'm playing with @entity1 and in 10 tournaments only one time - in last year 's @entity82 - were we already qualified by the third match ... so it 's not like much has changed			2
' @entity56 went to the @entity87 though he did n't play , but he 's held the starting place since 2002			2
heated : @entity56 ( right ) and @entity32 talk during training in @entity12 on sunday laying down the law : @entity32 addresses his team , which must win or draw to make the round of 16 @entity56 showed he could still be decisive in the third - place match of last year 's @entity82 , when he stopped three penalties in a shootout win over @entity10			1
that was after a 2 - 2 draw in which @entity98 scored both goals for @entity10			1
and @entity98 is not even @entity10 's most dangerous striker , as @entity101 showed when he scored both goals in a 2 - 1 win over @entity16 on thursday			2
' @entity98 and @entity101 are a great attack duo but it 's not like we 're just realising that now , ' @entity56 said			0
' they have confirmed themselves for many years with the national team and individually with their clubs			2
it 's normal when you face a squad of @entity10 's caliber that there are quality players			1
' @entity52 has spearheaded @entity1 's attack for the opening two matches but coach @entity32 could add @entity121 up front against @entity10			1
@entity121 led @entity123 with 22 goals for @entity125 before completing a transfer to @entity127 , just days before flying to @entity128			2
but his only action thus far was in the final 17 minutes of the @entity1 's 2 - 1 win over @entity16 in their opening match			0
extra striker : the @entity123 's top scorer @entity121 ( centre ) could line up with @entity52 against @entity10 work out : @entity1 do the hard yards under bright blue skies ' i do n't think @entity41 and @entity138 have ever played together , ' @entity56 said			1
' it would be something new that would carry all of the associated risks - and benefits			0
' @entity1 will also probably be without key defensive midfielder @entity143 , which could prompt coach @entity32 to revert from a four - man defense to the three - man formation employed by three - time @entity123 champion @entity146			0
@entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 - who each play for the @entity153 club - would fill those places			0
' our coach is always able to find the right balance in situations like this , ' @entity56 said			0
' he 's a maestro at that			0
... we 're definitely going to need a warm heart and a cold head			0
we ca n't throw away our self - confidence for one poor match			0
' no matter what happens on tuesday , it wo n't be easy for @entity1			0
' if we are eliminated after the first round it would be a failure , ' @entity56 said			0
' it would be a personal disappointment and nobody would hide from that			0
but if we advance we 're going to face hostile opponents and that 's where the real problems start			0

@entity38 play @entity10 on tuesday in a crucial @entity73 clash for both countries
the match will decide which team progresses along with @entity6 to the last 16 of @entity128 2014
@entity52 and the @entity38 squad were training hard on sunday in preparation for the big *upcoming* fixture
