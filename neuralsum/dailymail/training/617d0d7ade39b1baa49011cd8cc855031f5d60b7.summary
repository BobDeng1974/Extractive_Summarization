by @entity1 reporter published : 15:19 est , 6 december 2012 updated : 06:20 est , 7 december 2012 out of control : @entity3 is charged with torturing a teenager whom he kept captive at his @entity7 home from the age of 16 a woman pleaded guilty today to helping her husband keep a young woman locked up as a sex slave in their rural home			1
@entity15 , 47 , and husband @entity16 had been scheduled for trial in february on multiple charges including sex trafficking			1
prosecutors allege @entity21 , 45 , persuaded a 16 - year - old girl to live with the couple in @entity24 , @entity7			1
they say she was then given drugs and tortured until she was hospitalized in february 2009			2
the girl was a runaway and mentally disabled			2
the @entity27 had claimed the sex acts were consensual and part of the sexual lifestyle they practiced			1
defense attorneys plan to show evidence of ' sadistic sexual assaults '			2
the girl allegedly suffered water - boarding , electric shock , piercing and mutilation , according to the @entity39			2
@entity15 was in court this morning for an unannounced appearance			1
her plea deal has recommended that she be sentenced to probation			2
her husband faces life in prison for his prolonged torture of the young woman			1
four other men have been charged for allegedly paying @entity3 to have sex with his ' slave ' and to watch webcam sessions of her being tortured			0
the girl , who can not be identified , featured on the cover of @entity55 in 2010 - and her ' @entity56 ' was also photographed holding a rope			0
horrors : the young woman , who is mentally disabled , was drugged and kept as a sex slave at the @entity27 ' trailer the sordid case has caused some s&m advocates to fear a negative reaction to their lifestyle choices , which have come to public attention partly because of @entity68 's novel @entity67			1
manipulation : the young woman was allegedly forced to appear on the cover of @entity55 ( her face has been blurred to protect her identity ) some worry it could open up people who practice bondage , dominance , sadism and masochism - or @entity78 - to criminal charges for consensual acts they 're already performing , said @entity82 , founder of the @entity83 - based @entity84 in september			1
' we are following this case specifically because we were hoping this issue would not come up , ' she said			0
@entity3 is accused of grooming the young woman to be his sex slave from 2002 , then keeping her captive for years while making money from her images on fetish internet sites and forcing her to work as a dancer at strip clubs			1
the case came to light in early 2009 after the woman , then 23 , was hospitalized after what prosecutors said was a torture session			2
then - @entity102 attorney @entity101 called the case one of ' the most horrific ever prosecuted in this district '			0
advocates for the bdsm community say even the most brutal acts detailed in @entity3 's federal indictment are not criminal acts , as long as there was consent			0
but if the woman was too young or not intelligent enough to consent , as prosecutors allege , or if she initially gave consent and then changed her mind , it amounts to criminal sexual abuse			1
as in several other states , @entity7 assault laws limit instances in which consent can be used as a defense against criminal charges when serious injuries occur			1
exceptions generally are made for athletic activities and the victim 's occupation or professions in which the conduct and harm are reasonably foreseeable hazards			0
@entity135 's group contends ' serious physical injury ' is not well - defined under law			0
' the assessment of the seriousness of harm is often affected by judges ' " moral judgments about the iniquity of the conduct , " ' the organization says on its website in a section focusing on the consent issue			0
' courts tend to inflate the risk and harmfulness of an activity they want to denounce			0
for example , any injury caused during a sadomasochistic encounter has been consistently classified as serious			0
' @entity135 notes that regardless of the legal precedent , prosecutors ' attempts to present acts between @entity3 and his wife as evidence in the @entity7 case also comes at a time when kinky sex practices appear to be gaining broader public acceptance amid the popularity of the @entity168 bondage books			1
' because of @entity67 , a lot of people are trying bdsm for the first time this year , ' she said			0
' we want to be sure they understand they have to do these activities consensually , and to make sure they have the skill to do them safely			0

@entity15 , 47 , pleaded guilty to abuse of young woman in @entity7
@entity16 , who faces life in prison , said it was consensual @entity188
