@entity1 drinkers are so cautious of the country 's new drink - driving limits bar sales have plummeted by 60 per cent - a reduction in spending so severe it 's damaging the country 's financial growth			1
under the new @entity1 drink - drive law , enacted on december 5 , the limit was cut from 80mg per 100ml of blood to just 50mg			2
and the effect of the drop in sales is so severe , it is being blamed for a poor result in the country 's latest @entity18 @entity17 report			1
@entity1 's tough new drink driving law is being blamed for stalling the country 's financial growth @entity21 , chief economist at @entity18 , said : ' manufacturing exporters have been affected by the falling euro while services businesses in hospitality are seeing a changing pattern of spending resulting from the lowered alcohol limit while driving			1
' the report follows a february study which revealed the country 's bar sales had dropped by 60 per cent when the new limit was introduced			1
publicans are now concerned the new laws will have a greater effect on bars and drinking establishments than the 2006 smoking ban			1
@entity39 , chief executive of the @entity40 , told @entity41 the new law - which matches limits across much of @entity44 - was a ' form of prohibition '			2
he said : ' it ’s stopped people having a drink at lunchtime , or having a drink on the way home from work			0

there ’s questions being asked about the future of the trade – it ’s probably the last nail in the coffin for independent operators			0
' the february study , carried out by purchasing firm @entity78 , revealed there was a surge in interest in non-alcoholic drinks and smaller glass sizes			0
@entity84 , director of sales , said the first two months of the new drink driving laws had shown a ' real impact ' on the country 's hospitality industry			1
he said : ' traditional lunchtime drinkers , or post-golf drinkers in the clubhouse have been particularly affected by the new rules			0
' so much so , that we are seeing demand for smaller glasses , weaker beers , a trend towards introducing earlier lunch sittings so guests or golfers can stay longer and do not return to the roads as quickly , as well as an increased interest in " mocktails "			0
' in the wake of the law change , @entity105 assistant chief constable @entity104 encouraged drinkers to ' leave the car at home ' if they were planning to go for a drink			2
he said : ' there is no safe amount of alcohol in the body if you drive			0
it is clear when it comes to drinking and driving , that the simple " the best advice is none " message is the right one			0
' while the limit brings @entity1 in line with the rest of @entity44 , it is significantly lower than that of @entity129 and @entity130 - which remains at 80mg per 100ml of blood .			2
