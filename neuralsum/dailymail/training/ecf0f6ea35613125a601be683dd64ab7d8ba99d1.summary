by @entity0 follow @ @ neilashton _ in the search for success , @entity1 are by no means unique			2
since @entity6 appointed his godson @entity7 as chairman in 2001 , seven permanent managers have passed through @entity9 with an eighth now confirmed			1
in that time they have tired of @entity12 ( appointed pre-levy ) , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			1
earning his @entity1 : @entity22 ( centre ) has signed a five - year deal to become the new @entity1 boss @entity26 , @entity26 champions and beaten @entity28 finalists , are on to their 12th manager since the @entity7 regime began			1
since @entity33 ’s ninth @entity28 success , in 2002 at @entity34 , another nine hugely respected coaches tried and failed to win the 10th			0
@entity36 , @entity1 ’s principal target to replace @entity20 , finally landed no 10			1
@entity38 , who have won six @entity26 titles and three @entity42 cups since @entity6 bought into @entity1 , have fired seven managers since @entity7 arrived			1
@entity44 are on their 12th ; @entity45 are on to their ninth with @entity47			0
the problem for @entity1 is that no - one can quite work out what it is that they are trying to do			2
@entity7 has gone down every conceivable route and yet the manager is never safe , never secure			0
it never feels like they have total boardroom support			0
anyone who has ever received a payslip at @entity1 will tell you that this is the most political club in the @entity62			1
every member of staff is jostling for position or the ear of @entity7 as they grind their way through the season			0
now that @entity22 has become the manager on a five - year deal , the ambitions of this great club requires clarification			1
we know that fourth - placed finishes are not good enough because @entity18 was fired in may 2012			1
you could make a case that they have never recovered			0
they have the sixth highest wage bill in the @entity62 behind @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86			1
last season , under the very different approaches of @entity19 and @entity89 , they still finished sixth , five points ahead of the deposed champions @entity84			2
although they have some history on their side , they are only the 10th - best supported team in the @entity62			1
you have been warned : @entity20 ( left ) and @entity19 have both been dismissed by @entity1 chairman @entity7 ( below right ) in the past year @entity14 ( 2001 - 2004 ) @entity15 ( 2004 ) @entity16 ( 2004 - 2007 ) @entity17 ( 2007 - 2008 ) @entity18 ( 2008 - 2012 ) @entity19 ( 2012 - 2013 ) @entity20 ( 2013 - 14 ) @entity22 ( 2014 - ) * permanent managers appointed by @entity7 only - he sacked @entity12 in 2001 @entity1 are a big club , just not as big as @entity84 and @entity85 , and certainly no bigger than @entity102 , @entity82 , @entity86 , @entity83 , @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105			1
all of them had bigger average attendances than @entity1 in the @entity62			2
it feels like they are searching for something that does n’t really exist			0
history tells us that , but no - one can be sure what @entity7 wants for this club			2
they have tried various approaches over the years and will try again with another foreign coach			0
@entity22 just happens to be the latest			0
this is not an easy job to take , particularly with @entity1 ’s record for losing patience with their managers			0
@entity12 was sacked and replaced with the populist appointment of @entity14 before the @entity125 semi-final with @entity85 in april 2001			1
he was sacked in september 2003			0
@entity126 appointment : but @entity1 hero @entity14 's reign only lasted two years ruthless streak : @entity15 ( left ) lasted a few months and @entity16 ( right ) was sacked during a match when @entity16 was manager , @entity7 delivered a spanking new @entity131 to his house when all was well at @entity9			1
@entity16 later discovered he was being sacked during a @entity135 tie at @entity9 against @entity136 in 2007			1
@entity17 , described as ‘ a proper manager ’ by @entity138 when the defender arrived from @entity140 , lasted less than a year			2
the @entity142 coach was the last man to win silverware at @entity1 - the @entity144 against @entity83 at @entity145 in 2008 - but that was n’t enough			0
after a poor start the following season he , too , was gone			0
similarly , @entity19 was fired when he lost the players			0
he promised that the 6 - 0 defeat against @entity82 was a one - off and yet they were beaten 5 - 0 by @entity86 at @entity9 a few weeks later			0
@entity17 you 're a hero , the next you 're gone : @entity17 won the @entity144 in 2008 but was fired months later the fourth is not with you : @entity18 guided @entity1 into the @entity28 for the first time but left the club after he failed to repeat the trick @entity1 hope @entity22 will be able to unite a dressing room that was splintered under the leadership of @entity19 and @entity89 last season			1
that is the hope , that the @entity161 coach and his methods will be able to galvanise a group of talented players by the time the season starts on august 16			0
if it does n’t , then @entity22 will simply become another name who tried and failed at @entity1 .			2

@entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 are @entity7 's others
@entity7 also got *rid* of @entity12
@entity16 was given a @entity173 in good times but was sacked during a match
@entity22 has signed a five - year deal at @entity9
@entity1 are the most political club in the country
spurs have the sixth - highest wage bill in the @entity62
they have the 10th biggest support in the top *flight*
