by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 08:47 est , 9 october 2013 updated : 09:23 est , 9 october 2013 high school sports players in @entity4 have been banned from conducting post-game handshakes unless they are ‘ properly supervised ’ because of too many physical confrontations			2
the state ’s athletic sanctioning body , @entity9 ( @entity9 ) , posted the directive on their website on tuesday following more than two dozen post-game tussles in the past three years			1
the body ’s commissioner , @entity14 , did not mention specific fights or conflicts but said several sports have had post-game incidents			1
no more handshakes : @entity4 sports teams have been banned from engaging in organised post-game handshaking with the opposite team due to too many fights do it at own risk : schools are told they can continue doing the ritual , but that they will be penalised if fights break out ' disappointing ' : @entity32 , @entity14 , said over two dozen incidents have happened during post-game handshakes in three years in the directive , he said : ‘ do n’t do it , unless you can properly supervise it			1
and if you do n’t supervise it , or if you do and problems occur , then you will be held accountable			0
’ he said all sports have had problems over the years but cited a fight between volleyball players this fall as one example			0
the organisation , which also instructed game officials to immediately leave facilities after contests or risk being penalised , said it was ‘ disappointing ’ to take such action but that it had become necessary			1
‘ henceforth , any incidents by an individual squad member ( including coaches ) or group of squad members that results in unsporting acts immediately following the contest will result in a penalty against the member school athletic program , and additional penalties against the individuals or schools as deemed appropriate following investigation , ’ said @entity14			1
teams can choose to ignore the order , but those who do must supervise the activity and report any incidents to @entity9			1
member schools or coaches that engage in unsportsmanlike behaviour will be fined and penalised			0
‘ sportsmanship and civility remain hallmark values , ’ said @entity14			0
‘ it is my hope that all schools can provide the proper supervision and accountability to continue these types of activities			0
but if they ca n’t , then stop doing them			0
’ he said there was no penalty for continuing post-game handshakes , but that ‘ if you do n't do it right , you 're going to be held accountable ’			0
no more : high school football players are told not to give handshakes to their opposing teams to avoid fights breaking out ' penalised ' : game officials are also instructed to immediately leave facilities after contests or risk being fined @entity99 , varsity coach for @entity100 , told @entity101 that sportsmanship was ' the most important thing you can teach '			1
the coach has devised a plan to get around the new directive : ' if we ca n't shake our hand after the game , we can shake before the game			0
' with the state football playoffs just around the corner and the possibility of players shaking hands after an emotionally - charged elimination game , the directive was implemented to make schools take responsibility for conduct or not performing a ritual of sportsmanship			2
' good luck ' : @entity99 , varsity coach for @entity100 , said his teams are now having to shake hands before the game instead volleyball fights : the commissioner mentioned @entity127 as one of the sports where incidents have happened post-game ‘ unfortunately , for whatever reason , all involved in contests seem to be more aggressive immediately after the contests are concluded and winning with honour and dignity , and losing the same way , does n’t seem to be being instilled across the board , ’ he said			1
‘ if you have 75 players shaking hands , ’ @entity14 said , ‘ you 'd better watch what 's going on			2
’ not everyone agrees with the directive , with some people taking to @entity148 to complain			0
one comment from a @entity148 user , @entity150 , says , ‘ how about suspending the fighters instead ? ’ @entity152 , another @entity148 user , posted : ‘ as a @entity154 coach i can not say how ridiculous and object more to the new @ @entity9 policy is banning post game handshakes			2

schools can choose to ignore the ban but will be penalised if *altercations* happen
the @entity9 's commissioner , @entity14 , posted the directive on tuesday saying it was ' disappointing ' to take such measures
he said it comes after more than a dozen post-game tussles have happened in the past three years
the directive also instructs game officials to immediately leave facilities after games and contests or risk being penalised
' do n’t do it , unless you can properly supervise it , ' said @entity14
