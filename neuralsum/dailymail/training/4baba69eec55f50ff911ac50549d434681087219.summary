by @entity0 published : 07:56 est , 8 april 2013 updated : 08:18 est , 9 april 2013 @entity2 ’s quirky ’ 10 reasons why ’ videos cover a variety of issues affecting young people in modern life , and have propelled her to internet stardom			1
her @entity10 channel now has over 35,000 subscribers enjoying her frank and funny approach , complete with sketches , on topics as diverse as siblings and @entity16 , to sexual experiences			2
her latest video gives 10 reasons why her male fans should date an older woman , or ‘ cougar ’			1
i mean even i would have had sex with @entity46 ’s mum			0
’ reasons for this idolisation are , according to @entity39 , a great deal to do with the confidence older women often possess in comparison to their younger counterparts			1
this self - assurance means not only will there be less tantrums and insecurities in the relationship , but that a cougar is more likely to be assertive - which is sexy - and to be more independent			2
@entity39 's faux boyfriend @entity36 suffers with @entity39 as a non-cougar girlfriend who heavily relies on him @entity39 uses an online aging app to show that not everyone keeps their good looks not only is a cougar unlikely to lean on her man for emotional and financial support , she might actually take care of him			1
older women probably are n’t going to be tech savvy , so they cant check up on you 2			2
they are more experienced in the bedroom 3			0
older women are independent – they wo n't depend on you for financial and emotional support 4			0
there will be less tantrums and insecurities in your relationship 5			0
you wo n’t need to chase them , they ’ll chase you 6			0
a cougar will never drag you to see a twilight movie 7			0
they are wise , and so a cougar will take care of you 8			0
older women have enough life experience to know what they want 9			2
cougars are past stage of having children 10			0
your friends will be jealous they are also less likely to ‘ check up ’ on you using your phone or @entity96 , as a cougar probably wont be that tech savvy			0
another reason behind the cougar 's allure for a man is that they will pursue you			1
as @entity39 explains : ‘ a cougar is actually a big cat that likes to hunt , rather than be hunted			2
so if you detain a cougar , you wo n’t need to do the chasing , she ’ll get her man			0
’ and of course , another reason men should date a cougar is their additional sexual know - how and skills			1
as @entity39 points out : ‘ what ’s better than a hands on lesson ? ’ ‘ let ’s say you ’re the cougar and you ’re dating a younger guy who does n’t really know what he ’s doing in the bedroom , think how much you ’ll be helping him with future women he 'll have sex with , ’ she says			1
however , while a cougar having grown up in a different era may have benefits , it also of course means that they are older – and @entity39 uses an online ageing app on herself to show that this is not always such a good thing			1
