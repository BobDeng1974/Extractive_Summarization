it was falling down , it was dangerous so it had to be felled anyway , so i suggested we should cast it in iron and give it a new life			0

' he says it is not yet finished and is one of three art pieces			0
others called ' three thrones ' and ' @entity95 ' are set to follow			0

' we have engaged with local schools and community groups throughout the process and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive			0
local people have really played their part in creating this piece of art and we are sure they will love it for years to come			0
' the overall cost of the three new pieces of public art in @entity12 town centre is £ 320,000			1
this is made up of significant contributions from @entity14 and arts funding grants , along with council funding , so this money could only have been used for public art and not for any other purpose			2
