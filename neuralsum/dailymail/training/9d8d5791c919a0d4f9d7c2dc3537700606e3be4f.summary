by @entity0 the carcass of a blue whale is rotting along the shoreline of a town on @entity6 's east coast , triggering concerns from the community it could burst			1
@entity10 , the town clerk in @entity11 , @entity9 said the 28 yard blue whale is beached next to a community boardwalk and is emitting a powerful stench that is spreading through the town of 600 people			1
she said she and others in town are concerned that the methane gas caused by decomposition could cause the animal to burst			1
but @entity37 , a research scientist with @entity6 's fisheries department , said the risk of such a blast is ' very small '			1
he said : ' at some point , the skin of the animal will lose some of its integrity as all of the connective tissue starts to break down			2
@entity10 , the town clerk in @entity11 , @entity9 said the 28 yard blue whale is beached next to a community boardwalk and is emitting a powerful stench that is spreading through the town of 600 people when an animal dies , bacteria inside the carcass produce methane as part of the decomposition process			1
if this is not let out of the body gradually it builds up , exploding at the first opportunity			0
whales are the most extreme because their huge size makes the consequences of a gas build - up so much greater			1
living toads in @entity67 , @entity68 , started spontaneously combusting in 2005			0
it was thought crows were picking out their livers , leaving a hole , so when the toads puffed themselves up as a defence mechanism , their whole bodies burst			2
' eventually , that gas will seep out ...			2
it will just deflate like an old balloon			0
' still , mr @entity37 said people should stay away from the 60 - tonne carcass , which could be carrying viruses or bacteria that can make people sick			1
' the risk will come from somebody with a sharp blade who decides they want to cut a hole in the side to see what happens , or if someone is foolish enough to walk on it , ' he said			0
a website has even been set up specifically to update people waiting for the whale to explode , hasthewhaleexplodedyet.com			0
he said he is aware of @entity98 videos showing a bloated , beached sperm whale in the @entity100 that suddenly explodes as a scientist uses a large knife to cut open its underside			0
' with this animal ( in @entity9 ) , it 's highly unlikely that it 's going to happen , especially spontaneously , ' he said			1
the scientist said large , beached whales can either be buried with heavy equipment or cut up and shipped to a landfill			0
biologist @entity111 tried to cut open a sperm whale carcass which exploded in his face in november 2013 ms @entity10 asked for help from the province 's environment and government services departments as well as the federal fisheries department to remove the carcass			2
she said the town council considered asking fishermen to tow the mammal out to sea but concluded such a task would need to be supervised by someone with expertise			0
' nobody has been properly trained in the removal of whale carcasses of this size , ' she said			0
the whale is one of three beached along @entity9 's west coast .			2
