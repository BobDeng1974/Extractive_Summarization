by @entity0 it looks like a giant cocktail glass floating through the sky - but this might actually be the future of how we collect solar energy			1
@entity8 has allocated funds for preliminary research into the huge solar panel that would soak up the sun ’s rays from high above @entity14			1
the energy would be beamed down to our planet where power stations would pick it up and farm it out to customers			0
it looks like a cocktail glass floating in space , but the @entity22 might be might actually be the future of how we collect solar energy @entity8 is taking the idea so seriously it has asked one of its former engineers to provide a proof of concept study			1
@entity28 , who runs @entity30 based firm @entity29 , said the @entity31 , or @entity32 via arbitrarily large @entity33 , could become a reality one day			0
he claims that it would be much cheaper than some alternatives like a single array that could go around @entity14			2
it would be made up of thousands of thin , curved mirror - like pieces which could move around to ensure that they picked up as much sun as possible			2
the inside of the @entity31 would also be lined with photovaltic panels which convert the sun ’s energy into microwaves			0
the system would be made up of thousands of thin , curved mirror - like pieces which could move around to ensure that they picked up as much sun as possible these microwaves would then be beamed down to @entity14 out of the bottom end of the ‘ cocktail glass ’			1
on the @entity8 website mr @entity28 writes the project is a ‘ a novel , bio-mimetic approach to the challenge of space solar power ’			0
he says : ‘ if successful , this project will make possible the construction of huge platforms from tens of thousands of small elements that can deliver remotely and affordably 10s to 1000s of megawatts using wireless power transmission to markets on @entity14 and missions in space			2
’ the technology could make it more likely that mankind could build a @entity74 sphere			0
the spherical solar panel would go around the @entity76 and give us more energy than we ever need , but it is not clear how it could be brought back the 93 million miles to @entity14			1
turning the solar energy into microwaves and beaming them across space could now provide the answer			1
@entity8 ’s announcement comes after regulators in @entity30 approved a contract with @entity89 firm @entity88 to supply space based solar power to a company in the @entity93 as early as 2016			0
a group of @entity96 companies and the @entity97 also plans to launch a solar space station in 20 years ’ time .			0

solar energy *harvester* will beam energy to @entity14 in form of microwaves
huge solar panel would float in space
made of thousands of curved mirrors
