@entity2 's full @entity1 debut lasted just four laps and @entity4 suffered a huge shunt on a dreadful first morning for @entity6 at the @entity8 @entity7			1

just moments later , @entity4 , in the sister @entity6 , lost control of his car on the exit of @entity19 and crashed into the tyre barrier			1
it is the second big crash for @entity4 , who will start his 200th race this weekend , in less than a month after he was submitted to hospital following his 190mph shunt with @entity75 at june 's @entity76			2
as for @entity2 , all eyes had been on the 31 - year - old @entity78 , who briefly topped the timesheets before she stopped on track			0
she ended the session over eight seconds down on championship leader @entity62 , who was fastest ahead of team - mate @entity23			1
closing in : @entity62 's @entity61 team - mate @entity23 was close behind in second place frustrating : the @entity6 of @entity2 is helped off the @entity21 after just four laps @entity2 will now turn her attentions to the @entity87 @entity7 later this month where she will take part in the opening practice session at @entity90			1

' i want to say a huge thank you for all the support - it means a lot and really helps			0
' going out there was the best feeling and although there 's been a lot of media around this run , once i had put the helmet on that was the best feeling , and as soon as i had left the pit lane , everything felt good			0
' unfortunately it was a short run but i 'm going to look forward to @entity90			0
' @entity23 was over seven tenths adrift of @entity62 's best time , with the @entity87 29 points clear of his rival ahead of this weekend 's race			1
form : @entity125 's @entity124 again out - performed world champion @entity123 pretty : @entity127 's @entity8 driver @entity126 sported a pink helmet during first practice at @entity21 @entity131 's @entity130 was best of the rest in third with @entity124 's @entity125 fourth quickest , over a second slower than @entity62			1
@entity126 , wearing a one - off pink helmet in tribute to his father @entity136 , who died earlier this year , finished the session in seventh			0
