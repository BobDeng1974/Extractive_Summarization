@entity6 first photographed the four women - including his own spouse - in 1974 but did not like the way the photo turned out , a page for the exhibit says			1

we ’d go down to visit [ my wife ] @entity25 ’s parents on weekends			2
sisters : @entity6 first photographed @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 in 1974 but did not like the way the photo turned out			1
the next year , though , he did like a picture he took of the siblings			2
the 1975 photo is seen here standing together : the four sisters are seen posing together in 1978 ' it was kind of boring , a lot of socializing , we were expected to show up for dinner every day ... out of a friendly desperation , i said : ‘ let ’s take a picture			2
' @entity6 liked a 1975 picture he took of the siblings , however			1
@entity29 was 15 , @entity31 was 21 , @entity28 was 23 , and @entity50 's wife @entity30 was 25 , the @entity8 's exhibit page says			1
@entity6 has two children with @entity30			1
' it was after this second successful picture that the group agreed to gather annually for a portrait , and settled on the series ’ two constants : the sisters would always appear in the same order — from left to right , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , and @entity31 — and they would jointly agree on a single image to represent a given year , ' the exhibit page explains			1
' we are all aware of time passing and us not being aware of it while it ’s passing , ' @entity6 told @entity18			2
' so seeing the sisters , for a lot of people , gives them a reliable marker that a year has passed			2
' passage of time : @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 are seen next to one another in 1988 still here : the @entity50 sisters look into @entity6 's camera in this 1999 shot @entity6 spoke about the photo series with the @entity77 last august			1
he said at the time ' it did n't really get serious until the next year [ 1975 ] , the year of @entity31 — the woman on the right 's — college graduation			1
and that 's when i took the second one , and kind of on a whim , said let 's do it in the same order			2
' so it was having two pictures in my hand , and the year space between them that gave me the idea that it would be really interesting to do it forever			0
and so i asked them if we could			0
and they all laughed at me and said sure			0
' we joke about it			0
but everybody knows that certainly my intention would be that we would go on forever no matter what			0
to just take three , and then two , and then one			0
the joke question is what happens if i go in the middle			0
i think we 'll figure that out when the time comes			0
being an only child , it was really gratifying and lovely to be embraced by this family			0
there 's still a ground water of affection , and support			0
i look back at these thirty - some pictures and it 's like they 're of my sisters			2
i can feel myself getting old with them			0
and i 'm part of them ; they 're part of my love			0
