a grieving widower has blasted phone company @entity1 after they charged him £ 62 to cancel his wife 's £ 5 - a - month phone , just weeks after she died of cancer			1
@entity6 , 73 , from @entity7 in @entity8 , was left heartbroken when wife @entity9 died aged 74 on november 27 , after a short battle with lung cancer			1
the great - grandfather - of - four decided to wait until the new year to sort out the financial affairs of his wife of 52 years , and contacted the phone company last week			1
@entity6 has blasted the mobile network @entity1 for telling him he needed to pay £ 62 to end his dead wife 's £ 5 - a - month phone , just weeks after she died of cancer but he was left shocked when two different call handlers both demanded he pay £ 62 to end the contract - despite it only costing £ 5.49 - a - month			1
mr @entity6 and his family are now boycotting the firm and have refused to pay any further charges			2
problems arose because although the phone was mrs @entity28 's , the account was in her husband 's name			2
mrs @entity28 's phone was a 16 - year - old @entity33 and mr @entity6 paid @entity1 £ 5.49 - a - month for a sim - only deal			1
it included 500 minutes , 500 text and 250mb of data every month			0
mr @entity6 , a former @entity39 driver said : ' when @entity9 passed it was very sudden			1
she had been diagnosed with cancer months before but when her time came it was all over very quickly			0
@entity1 have agreed to close the account without the cancellation fee being paid as a ' gesture of goodwill ' ' i was in bits , so i decided to leave sorting out her affairs until after the new year and the funeral			1
' so i set about sorting everything out last week , i had heard of people having some problems with the government groups like the @entity57 before , but they were as good as gold and sorted it out			0
' so i called @entity1 and explained my wife had died and i would not be using the phone			1
' i said it would be switched off the moment i finished the call and never turned on again			0
' so i could n't believe it when the very nice man on the line said ' fine , that will be £ 62 '			1
' i explained again that my wife had died and could n't use the phone , so he transferred me to another person , a lovely girl , who again told me i needed to pay the money			1
' it was only a sim contract , just a little one			2
my wife never wanted a fancy phone or anything , so just took out a year - long contract			1
' she used to be on pay - as - you - go but when she was diagnosed she knew she would be in and out of hospital and wanted the phone to make the odd call and mainly send texts			2
' it was barely ever used , and wo n't be now so i just wanted to end it			0
' now i will be ending my own contract with them when it finishes , as will my family and a lot of my friends			0
' i 'm having to get on with life without @entity9 , which is hard enough without added needless stresses			2
' i had to use her phone to make these calls , how do they think that made me feel			0
' she was such a lovely woman , the church was amazed by how many people turned up at her funeral to pay their respects			0
' she used to volunteer , especially after she retired from @entity100 's and i was still driving the hgv			0
mr @entity6 has blasted @entity1 for their ' lack of compassion ' billing him just weeks after his wife 's death ' the account was in my name , but i did n't use it			1
you would think people would have some compassion			0
' mr @entity6 's daughter @entity28 , 50 , added : ' since mum passed away , dad has been heartbroken			2
they were together for 55 years and married for 52			0
' cancelling the phone contract was hard enough for him because he gets upset talking about mum , so he was very upset when they told him it would cost him £ 62			1
' i do n't think it 's right they should be charging him that - it 's not his fault that he had to cancel the contract			2
' if he had been cancelling it to change networks then fair enough , but he was doing it because somebody died			0
' @entity1 have agreed to close the account without the cancellation fee being paid			1
a spokesman said : ' we of course close accounts without any cancellation fees if a customer has passed away			0
' in this instance , the account was in the husband 's name , and given this exceptional circumstance we have closed the account and waived the balance as gesture of goodwill			0
