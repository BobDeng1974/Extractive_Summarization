modern humans have been blamed for killing off the @entity1 by out competing them , breeding with them and even outright murdering them			1
but new research suggests it may actually have been infectious diseases carried by our modern ancestors as they migrated out of @entity6 that finished them off			1
scientists studying the latest genetic , fossil and archaeological evidence claim that @entity1 suffered from a wide range of diseases that still plague us today			1
but anthropologists from @entity34 and @entity35 say that new diseases carried by modern humans may have led to the downfall of @entity1			1
it has been around 30,000 years since the ancestors of modern - day humans are thought to have wiped out the ancient @entity1			1
but the extinct species could be taking revenge on us from beyond the grave by making us more vulnerable to potentially killer diseases such as cancer and diabetes			0
neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co-existed for thousands of years and interbred , meaning @entity21 now have roughly two per cent @entity1 dna			1
these ' legacy ' genes have been linked to an increased risk from cancer and diabetes by new studies looking at our evolutionary history			0
however , some genes we inherited could have also improved our immunity to other diseases			0
scientists have found that part of our @entity65 system , which helps white blood cells to identify and destroy foreign material in the body , could have come from @entity1			0
other researchers have suggested that humans outside @entity6 are more vulnerable to type 2 diabetes because they interbred with @entity1			1
researchers from @entity74 and @entity75 universities have also found that genes thought to be risk factors in cancer were present in the neanderthal genome			0
a gene that can cause diabetes in @entity82 is also thought to have come from @entity1 , long before their ancestors colonised the @entity84			2
another recent genetic study by scientists at the @entity87 has suggested that @entity1 may have suffered from psoriasis and crohn 's disease , a condition that affects the digestive system			2
they speculate that pathogens like @entity93 , the bacteria that causes stomach ulcers , were brought to @entity21 by modern humans from @entity6 and may have infected @entity1 , who would have been unable to fight off these new diseases			1
however , @entity99 may have also helped modern humans by passing on slivers of immunity against some diseases to our ancestors when they interbred			1
dr @entity105 , a principal lecturer in anthropology at @entity35 and co-author of the study , said : ' as neanderthal populations became more isolated they developed very small gene pools and this would have impacted their ability to fight off disease			0
' when homo sapiens came out of @entity6 they brought diseases with them			2
' we know that @entity1 were actually much more advanced than they have been given credit for and we even interbred with them			0
' perhaps the only difference was that we were able to cope with these diseases but @entity1 could not			0
' the findings add to a growing body of evidence that @entity1 were not as different from modern humans as was originally thought			1
recent discoveries have suggested that rather than being brutish cavemen , @entity1 had sophisticated culture , were master tool makers and may even have had their own language			0
the new study suggests that @entity1 also suffered from many of the same afflictions and complaints that modern humans experience			1
indeed , there is some evidence from caves that early humans may have burned their bedding in a bid to rid themselves of infestations of lice or bed bugs			0
dr @entity105 and his colleague dr @entity147 , a researcher in infectious diseases at @entity34 and @entity149 , analysed recent genetic studies on @entity1 and other early humans			1
they also examined recent genetic research on common human pathogens that have aimed to trace their origins and combined it with fossil and archaeological evidence			0
infectious bacteria like those that cause tuberculosis , shown above , may have been common in @entity1 most evidence from the fossil record suggest that @entity1 tended to suffer traumatic injuries as a result of their hunter gatherer lifestyle , but there are also signs of inflammation and infection			1
their study , which is published on the open source database @entity171 , contradicts the common view that infectious diseases only really became a problem for humans in the @entity176 about 11,000 years ago when humans began living in dense settlements and farming livestock			1
instead , they say many of the diseases we see around us today were common during the pleistocene when @entity1 dominated much of @entity21 and @entity183 between 250,000 and 45,000 years ago , when they disappeared			2
neanderthals are thought to have numbered up to 70,000 at their peak and lived in hunter gatherer societies they say pathogens like @entity188 , typhoid and @entity191 fever that were thought to be zoonoses caught from herd animals may have actually originated in humans and were only passed to animals during the rise of farming around 8,000 years ago			0
genetic sequencing of @entity1 and @entity199 - another early human ancestor - @entity200 has shown that modern humans have inherited a number of genes from these extinct species			1
these include genes that provide immunity to viral infections such as tick - borne encephalitis			0
dr @entity105 said this virus would probably have been common in the forested areas of northern @entity21 that @entity1 inhabited and so immunity would have been an advantage			2
other genes found in modern @entity215 that are involved in the immune response against viruses like dengue and influenza may have come from @entity1			0
the fossilised remains of @entity1 , like the skull above , are revealing more details about their lifestyles analysis of ancient dna has also shown that @entity1 carried genes that would have protected them against bacterial blood poisoning , or sepsis			2
dr @entity105 said : ' there are genetic signals in the neanderthal genome that suggest quite clearly that they were exposed to these types of diseases but also developed some resistance to them			0
' it had been thought that many of these diseases began infecting humans with the population increases that came with domestication of animals and permanent settlements			0
' be here we have got @entity1 being infected by these diseases long before those developments			2

anthropologists claim that @entity1 suffered many modern diseases
dna analysis has shown that they had immunity against common illnesses
but they believe modern humans brought new infectious pathogens such as @entity93 with them out of @entity6 and infected @entity1
this suggests infectious diseases are much older than *previously* thought
