by @entity0 last updated at 3:18 pm on 10th january 2012 [ headerlinks ] a group of astrophysicists from the @entity3 suggests a habitable @entity5 - like planet could exist in a distant solar system found by @entity8 ’s kepler space telescope			1
@entity9 has two stars , like @entity11 ’ fictional @entity12			1
@entity13 made headlines in september when researchers discovered @entity16 , a cold , gaseous planet orbiting both stars			0
the @entity3 team , have concluded that an @entity5 - type planet could exist in the system ’s ‘ habitable zone ’ – as a moon orbiting @entity16			1
the @entity13 made headlines in september when researchers discovered @entity16 , a cold , gaseous planet orbiting both stars			0
the team has concluded that an @entity5 - type planet could exist in the system ¿ s ¿ habitable zone ¿ ¿ as a moon orbiting @entity29 - 16b to host life in that zone , a terrestrial planet orbiting the two stars would need to have high levels of greenhouse gases in its atmosphere such as carbon monoxide or methane , they said			1
@entity40 of physics professor @entity41 said , ‘ this is an assessment of the possibilities			0
we ’re telling them where a planet has to be in the system to be habitable			2
we ’re hoping they will look there			0
’ ‘ there is less light from the star , so the planet itself has to maintain more heat , ’ said phd student @entity50 , one of the co-authors on the paper			0
science fiction : the notion of a planet wth two suns may seem familiar - because @entity63 lived on one in @entity11 @entity29 's mission is to scour our section of the @entity68 galaxy for @entity5 - like planets in the so - called ' habitable zone ' that is not too close and not too far away from the stars they orbit			1
the spacecraft does this by finding stars whose light periodically gets dimmer , which means there is a planet passing between the star and @entity29 's instruments			0
this is known as a planetary transit			0
if the notion of a planet with two suns was displayed in the earliest @entity11 film on the fictional planet @entity12 , home of @entity63			2
@entity12 was a rocky , desert planet , but kepler - 16b is a cool gas giant , @entity93 and other researchers said			2
extraordinary : an artist 's illustration of @entity16 , the first planet known to orbit two stars kepler - 16b is similar to @entity101 in size and mass , a cold gas giant that orbits its two suns every 229 days at a distance of 65 million miles ( 104.6 million km ) .			1

@entity5 - like moon could orbit two suns of @entity9 system
habitable moon would be shrouded in @entity113 or methane
team urges @entity8 to look for ' *extrasolar* moon '
