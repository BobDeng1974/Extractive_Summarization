@entity1 's @entity0 has often played second fiddle to @entity3 , but at the @entity4 , it shone - correctly predicting 20 of the 24 results			1
@entity0 successfully predicted best picture , best director , best actor , best actress , and the results for supporting actor and actress			1
even the four predictions it got wrong were its second choice predictions			1
@entity1 says its predictions are based on a ' several attributes beyond accuracy , including flexibility , scalability , and timeliness			1
' the key was to find people skilled at predictions			1
' prediction markets follow a select group of people who have high levels of information on what voters will do and are willing to wager real - money on the outcomes , ' the firm said			2
' @entity39 calibrated 20 of 24 ( w / 4 2nd place winners ) , ' said @entity41 , who leads @entity1 's @entity43 team			1
ahead of the @entity4 @entity1 shared its latest predictions , claiming that most of the awards are ' relatively unpredictable			1
' @entity1 uses a prediction model for the @entity4 managed by @entity41 at the company 's @entity43 research lab. he correctly predicted 21 of 24 @entity51 winners last year , and 19 of 24 winners in 2013			1
this year , he said , said that many of the categories were influenced by films not nominated			1
before the ceremony , many online comments were objecting to the lack of nominations for ' @entity60 , ' and , on a light - hearted note , incredulity about ' the @entity63 ' not receiving an @entity65 nomination			2
@entity41 said that does n't mean the un-nominated ca n't affect the @entity51 winners in those ' disputed ' categories			1
' absence in the category makes a difference in the distribution of votes for the remaining choices , ' he said			2
' as this controversy ebbed and flowed over the last few weeks , we had to make sure to take into account how it may affect the final votes , ' he said			2
' whenever i create predictions i focus on several attributes beyond accuracy , including flexibility , scalability , and timeliness , ' @entity41 said			1
however , he admitted that the pubic ca n't always be trusted			2
' one way to take this into account is to follow the public opinion on the topic and assume that public opinion will translate into pressure on the voters			2
' however , public opinion is only loosely related to winners in the @entity4 , because the sentiment and expectations of the general public is closely tied to name recognition and popularity			2
' a night full of stars : the @entity104 in @entity105 was filled to the brim with @entity108 's leading actors the man who predicted the @entity4 : @entity41 , who leads @entity1 's @entity43 team			1
@entity41 says it 's also difficult to match public opinion to a specific category			2
' there are not even many alternatives to express dissatisfaction in the nomination process in that there is no clear movie for people to support in lieu of @entity60 's lack of nominations			2
' the key was to find people skilled at predictions			1
' prediction markets follow a select group of people who have high levels of information on what voters will do and are willing to wager real - money on the outcomes , ' he says			0
' and , prediction market - based forecasts have been incredibly accurate , ' hence the aforementioned successful predictions of previous years ' @entity51 winners			1
' had you asked me about the likely winners in the top six categories last week , two of them would have been different , ' @entity41 admitted			1
the winners of the @entity147 were announced in @entity105 on sunday evening			0
continuing his clean sweep of awards season , emotional @entity148 was almost too choked to speak as he picked up best actor for his portrayal of physicist @entity153 in @entity154			1
' thank you – i do n't i 'm capable of articulating quite how i feel right now but please know this – i am fully aware of that i am lucky , lucky man , ' he began , clutching his trophy			0
' this @entity51 – wow ! – this @entity51 , this belongs to all of those people around the world , battling @entity162 , ' he added staring at the statuette in disbelief			0
meanwhile , it might not have swept the board completely , but @entity166 still flew home with the @entity51 on the night			0
the comedy drama swooped off with a total of four awards on sunday night - a number that tied with @entity172 - including @entity173 and @entity174			0
overcome : @entity175 actor @entity148 , 33 , gave an emotional speech as he was named @entity151 for his portrayal of physicist @entity153 in @entity154 - a win predicted by @entity1			1
elegant as ever : the 54 - year - old beauty wore her hair in a sleek updo and set off the look with a pair of sparkly drop earrings the 87th annual ceremony favoured niche movies instead of big box office hits , with films including @entity190 and @entity191 missing out on the top prizes			0
however , @entity166 's lead actor @entity193 was beaten to his best actor by @entity148			1
backstage , 33 - year - old @entity148 revealed that winning was like a ' weird and wild dream '			0
there were no surprises when it came to the actresses , with favourites @entity201 winning for @entity202 for @entity203 , and @entity204 winning for @entity205			0
@entity201 became emotional when she revealed for the first time that her husband @entity207 predicted she would win the @entity51			2
' i 've never told anyone this ... but [ my husband ] was the first person to see the film			0
' he was crying and i was like what 's going on ? ' she said			0
' when we walked out he said you 're going to win an @entity51 and i said ' like come on ! '			0
the other big winner of the night was @entity217 's @entity172 , taking home four awards in total			0
the energetic evening saw @entity51 host @entity220 put on a theatrical performance at the @entity223 theatre			0
@entity220 , 41 , only managed a few jokes before bringing out his jazz hands , performing a hilarious original song - moving pictures - about the great and good of @entity108			0
@entity220 's spirited routine - where he was joined by @entity228 and @entity230 - paid tribute to some of @entity108 's best known performances and scenes , and had the star - studded audience			0
taking home the first of award of the night was @entity238 for @entity239 - a perhaps unsurprising win considering he has swept the board in the same category this awards season			0
