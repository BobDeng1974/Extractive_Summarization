by @entity0 if you just ca n't be without your phone or tablet , even when you 're in bed , a pair of @entity3 inventors have created a pillow that doubles up as a charger			2
the @entity10 comes with two portable batteries , and each battery is fitted with two usb ports capable of charging a phone and tablet at the same time			1
its makers claim each battery will charge an @entity20 six times before it runs out of power , but will need to be charged for 10 hours to reach full capacity again			1
the @entity23 , pictured left in a bedroom and right on a sofa , comes with two portable batteries			2
one is placed inside the pillow , while the other can be charged separately via a wall plug			1
each battery has two ports , meaning two devices can be charged at the same time electric lights , including those which illuminate laptop computers , smartphones and tablets , often play a key role in causing people to sleep badly , according to a leading health expert			1
artificial lights disrupt the body 's natural rhythm , affect chemicals in the brain and drive people to use stimulants like caffeine to stay awake longer			0
the claims were made by professor of sleep medicine at @entity52 , @entity53			0
however , a follow - up study by psychiatrists in @entity56 found that simply lowering the brightness of a screen and holding the gadget about 12 inches away from the face can stop the light from interfering with a good night ’s sleep			0
the @entity23 is aimed at people who ' watch films or tv , check emails , or read on their tablets and @entity68 in bed			0
' it is the brainchild of @entity3 inventor @entity71 who came up with the idea when he was speaking to his brother on the phone in bed and his battery ran out			0
he started working on the project with his partner @entity79 and they created various designs and prototypes			0
the pair has now launched a campaign on @entity85 and is hoping to raise $ 30,000 ( £ 18,200 ) to fund the device			0
the pillow is being sold for $ 79 ( £ 48 ) for a pillow and one battery			2
people who donate $ 124 ( £ 76 ) will be sent a cushion , two batteries , and two micro usb cables			2
@entity79 , 37 , from @entity94 in @entity3 , said : ‘ @entity71 and i were relaxing in bed when his brother @entity96 called : ' while he was on the phone with his brother he blurted out " why not have a pillow that you can directly connect your phone to for charging			0
" ' the @entity23 , pictured , is aimed at people who watch films or tv , check emails , or read on their tablets and kindles at home			0
it is the brainchild of @entity3 inventor @entity71 who came up with the idea when he was speaking to his brother on the phone in bed and his battery ran out ‘ i was sitting next to him on the bed working on my laptop and thought it was a good idea , and we immediately started working on the @entity10			1
people who donate $ 124 ( £ 76 ) to the @entity85 campaign receive a cushion , pictured , two batteries , and two micro usb cables ‘ we have gone through dozens of design drawings , dozens of batteries and over a dozen prototypes			2
’ the charging system comes with two @entity127 battery packs , one is kept in the pillow along with a charging usb cable			1
the other pack is charged separately via a wall plug			1
when one battery dies , it can be replaced with the fully - charged pack so the pillow is never without charge			1
alternatively , the second battery can be carried in a bag or pocket and used to charge a device when out of the house			1
each lithium polymer battery in the pillow is lined with @entity144 fabric made with carbon nanotubes to offer protection against the voltage			1
they are also cased in a battery pack			0
‘ in a nut shell , @entity23 will make running to an outlet a thing of the past , ‘ continued @entity79			0
‘ even with one per cent battery left on your phone , by simply plugging into the @entity10 right beside you , you will extend your call for literally hours			1
the same goes for watching movies and playing games			0
