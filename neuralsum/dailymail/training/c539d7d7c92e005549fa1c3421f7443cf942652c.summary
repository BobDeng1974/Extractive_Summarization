a @entity1 entrepreneur has opened a beauty salon to help rehabilitate the female survivors of acid attacks who are ' usually left to rot in their houses like vegetables '			1
@entity9 founded the @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity1 , to help victims become self - reliant members of the community following their horrific ordeal			1
the foundation 's aim is to provide the women with medical and psychological care and help them gain confidence and employment			1
over the last decade , @entity30 has helped around 600 women , with most electing to be trained as beauticians as they feel safe in the female - only world			1
others have been given the support they need to start their own businesses			2
@entity30 said she knew she had to do something to help the young women who are disfigured in attacks often linked to family disputes , sexism or misogyny			2
employment options : the salon in @entity11 , @entity1 , is giving burns victims job opportunities in a society where they are often ' treated like lepers ' team work : @entity30 with acid attack victims @entity61 , left , and @entity62 at the reception of her salon moved to action : @entity30 was inspired to set up the foundation after she met a burns victim in 2003 not hiding away : @entity62 said thanks to @entity30 she now has the confidence ' to face the world ' she knew they needed more than just surgery to get their lives back on track			1
she said : ' on average they need to go through 25 surgeries to make them look better and then i also realised that giving them surgeries is not helping their misery , is not helping their pain because they are left to rot in their houses like vegetables			1
' they are treated like modern day lepers			2
' the philanthropist said she was moved to start the foundation following an encounter with an acid attack victim in 2003			1
she said : ' as i was about to leave my office , a young girl walked in and she was wearing a veil and she asked me to help her and i thought maybe maybe she 's one of those girls who 's asking for financial help and support			2
life changed forever : @entity102 before left , and after being the victim of an acid attack ordeal : @entity30 knew that women like @entity61 , pictured , needed more than just surgery to help them recover ' i asked her to come the next day as i was going home and then she removed her veil and that was the day which changed my life			1
' the girl in front of me was a woman without a face			0
she had lost her eyes , she had lost her nose , her neck was contracted to her chest			0
' @entity102 and @entity62 are both acid attack survivors who work in the salon			1
@entity102 said : ' after this tragedy of getting burnt , i had a feeling that i am not the same person anymore			0
i stopped venturing out of my house			0
i stopped meeting people as well			0
i stopped attending any gatherings and functions			0
@entity62 said she stopped venturing out of the house after her face was disfigured by a horrific acid attack , pictured before left and after right ' after coming here , @entity9 helped me a lot			1
first she made me undergo surgeries for my face and then i did a course to become a beautician			0
' @entity62 added : ' after coming here , my life changed completely			0
she taught me how to face the world			0
' she made me believe that i have the ability to cope with anything and anyone			0
it boosted my self - confidence so that i could lead my life in a better way			1
' acid attacks continue to be a problem in @entity1 , with women burned for everything from having a female child to offering too small a dowry			1
fresh start : the salon is helping the women regain confidence and happiness @entity30 said : ' making laws will never curb a crime , it will never stop a crime , it 's only the implementation which is important and how do we do that ? the government has to take stern actions against these perpetrators			2
* ' sometimes it seems the incidents are on a decrease then all of a sudden you will see in one month there are five girls been attacked with acid			2
so i think there is much more than what is being reported			0
' to me , these girls are our heroes			0
