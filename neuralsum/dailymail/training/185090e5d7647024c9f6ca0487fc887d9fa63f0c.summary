she was gang - raped by three men in a horrific attack at the age of 20 and has spent six years battling to receive compensation to pay for psychological help to rebuild her life			1
now @entity8 has decided to speak out about the devastating experience in 2008 that has left her broken , as she appeared on the @entity11 ’s 7:30 report to expose how budget cuts have meant she received less than half of the compensation she was once promised			1
ms @entity8 wants the @entity14 to reassess her case after they handed her a paltry $ 15,000 instead of $ 50,000			1
after her parents went home she stayed at the club to have a drink and play on the pokies when she met a young man and quickly struck up a rapport			0
' he seemed like a really nice guy - we started talking and we had a lot in common at the time , so i had no reason to be in fear of the man - i was just having a good time , ' she said she agreed to go dancing with him at a nightclub and when he brought two friends to join them she was not alarmed			2
when they ended up driving 20 kilometres to @entity24 to a riverbank for ‘ a few beers ’ , she convinced herself not to worry and ended up having consensual sex with the man she ’d met earlier			0
but when she opened her eyes and saw his friends surrounding them , he told his mates ‘ sharing ’s caring , get down here			0
’ a distraught ms @entity8 told 7.30 on monday night : ‘ that 's when the other two took turns at raping me			1
’ ' they just got on top of me and spread my legs apart and one of them was holding the top part of my body down so that that i could n't get up and they just had sex with me , ' she said			0
now ms @entity8 is too frightened to go out as she has relived the horror everyday for the past six years the @entity28 at @entity29 's where ms @entity8 met the man who invited his two mates to join them ms @entity8 had spent the night with her family at the club before she decided to stay a bit longer on her own the men drove back to @entity29 's and dumped her at a petrol station where the attendant called the police who took her to hospital for a rape examination			1

ms @entity8 ’s case was finally approved in june but she was appalled when she was awarded just $ 15,000			1
‘ i 've paid through the nose for psychological help to recover but because the government still has n't paid my victims of crime compensation – 6 years since being raped – it 's meant i 've been in debt and had to borrow money from friends and family just to get help , ' ms @entity8 said			1
in 2013 , the government retrospectively changed the legislation to cut the amount of compensation and support for gang rape victims			2
‘ i do n't understand why they 're doing this to me			0
i ca n't fully move on because the government wo n't finalise my case , ' she said			2
' to me it says the government does n't care about victims - all it cares about is saving some money			2

' she is desperately trying to move on from the horror of that night six years ago			1
' now i just want this to all be over , to have closure on this and be able to get the ongoing help i need to recover , ’ she said			0
