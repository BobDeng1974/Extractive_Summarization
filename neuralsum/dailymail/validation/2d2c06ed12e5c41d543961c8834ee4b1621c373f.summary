anyone who has flown back from a holiday at night will have marvelled at the twinkling blanket of lights that cover towns and cities after dark			0
but the crew of the @entity8 has gone one better , by capturing this light show from the @entity8 's orbit around 250 miles ( 400km ) above the @entity11			1
the six - second vine loop was posted at 9.32pm gmt last night and shows the station soaring over the @entity14 and @entity15			1
@entity21 and @entity22 are in relative darkness			0
as the station moves towards @entity15 , the bright lights of @entity25 and @entity26 in @entity27 and @entity28 in @entity29 can be seen the @entity31 was taken by @entity33 crew member @entity32			1
during the clip , the @entity8 begins by approaching the @entity14 from the south west hitting @entity21 first , the north west coast of @entity35 is visible in the bottom right - hand corner but @entity39 is just out of shot			1
the bright section of light in the east of the @entity14 is @entity20 , while @entity22 and @entity21 are in relative darkness			2
and as the station moves towards @entity15 , the bright lights of @entity25 and @entity26 in @entity27 and @entity28 in @entity29 can be seen			2
the 37 - year - old flight engineer - alongside her colleagues commander @entity43 , flight engineer @entity46 and @entity48 cosmonauts @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 - has been on board the station since 9 november last year			1

during her four - month stay on the station ms @entity68 has filmed herself getting a haircut in space and released a collection of images called @entity75 : landscapes			1
one of the most striking images in this collection shows the lights of the south coast of @entity81 and the north coast of @entity35 , taken above the @entity83 in january			1
the 37 - year - old flight engineer - alongside her colleagues commander @entity43 , flight engineer @entity46 and @entity48 cosmonauts @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 - has been on board the station ( pictured ) since 9 november last year the current @entity33 crew on @entity8 recently created a collection of images taken from the station of landscapes on @entity11			1
one of the most striking photos shows the glittering lights of the south coast of @entity81 and the north coast of @entity35 , taken above the @entity83 in january ( pictured )			2
it shows concentrations of light in major towns and in the distance a green light that looks like the @entity104 glows it shows concentrations of light in major cities and towns and in the distance , on the curvature of the @entity11 , a green light that looks like the @entity104 glows			0
the entire @entity8 was spun 180 degrees yesterday and lowered slightly in its orbit last month so that visiting spacecraft can bring more cargo to the station			2
the remarkable manoeuvre saw a @entity118 spacecraft ‘ slow ’ the speed of the station			0
this changed the height of its orbit by about 1.6 miles ( 2.5km ) , before the station was spun back again to its original position			2
this is the same location where this @entity31 was taken			2
the @entity8 is marking its 15th anniversary of continuous human occupation on 2 november this year and since expedition 1 in 2000 , the space station has been visited by more than 215 people			1
as of november 2014 , there have been 100 @entity48 launches , 37 space shuttle launches , one test flight and three operational flights by @entity136 ’s @entity135 as well as a test flight and two operational flights by @entity140 ’s @entity139			0
a total of 184 spacewalks have been conducted in support of space station assembly totaling over 1,152 hours , or approximately 48 days			0
the space station , including its large solar arrays , spans the area of a @entity149 football field , including the end zones , and weighs 924,739 pounds			0
the complex now has more livable room than a conventional six - bedroom house , and has two bathrooms , a gymnasium and a 360 - degree bay window			0
a second image in the @entity75 : landscapes collection was taken above the big island of @entity160 in the @entity161			0
it was captured on 28 february and the peaks of volcanoes @entity164 and @entity166 can be seen in the centre of the 4,028 square mile ( 10,432 square kilometre ) land mass. @entity164 is the world 's largest , and one of its most active , volcanoes			0

the @entity8 will *celebrate* its 15th anniversary of continuous human occupation in november
crew member @entity177 filmed this @entity31 video on board the @entity8 on last night
