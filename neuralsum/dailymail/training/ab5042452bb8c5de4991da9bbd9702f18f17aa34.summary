it is the wish list of a dying @entity2 man who , doctors say , has just weeks left on @entity4			1
former corporate high - flyer @entity5 , 57 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , has terminal oesophageal cancer			1
two weeks ago , he was told he has just 90 days to live			1
but , in his own words , ' everyday 's a ball ' - and there 's just three things he wants to do before he passes on			1
' @entity17 movie did dying such a disservice , ' he told @entity19 , referring to a 2007 comedy flick			0
' it 's not about rushing around and trying to do all the bloody things you wanted			2
' it 's about being close to the people you 're close to			2
' @entity5 , centre , is pictured here with his wife @entity29 and son @entity30 touching embrace : @entity5 is pictured here with his son , @entity30 , during a forthcoming documentary about the end of @entity5 's life mates : @entity5 is currently spending precious time with his family including his son @entity30 and wife @entity29 @entity5 was diagnosed with oesophageal cancer five years ago			1
he recovered , but on january 28 this year doctors told him it had returned in a terminal form he is going to tick off the first item on his list on friday , when he goes for a drive down a windy road in his @entity50 with his son , @entity30 , 27			1
they will rip through the @entity53 line of road in @entity55 and go for a dip in the @entity57			0
' that 'll be a great day , ' @entity5 told @entity19			1
another wish will be completed on february 1			0
that 's @entity30 's first day of work in his graduate job			1
that evening , @entity5 wants to crack open a bottle of red with him			1
and then there is his final hope			0
he told a @entity68 inquiry last month he wants to have a ' magnificent ' death - ' not ... swallowing a whole lot of pills hoping it works and spitting them half back up '			1
but voluntary euthanasia - also known as voluntary assisted suicide - is not legal in @entity2			2
so as the final item on his bucket list , he wants to confront prime minister @entity78 about the @entity80 's position against euthanasia			1
' i 'm not going to die with a thing on the wish list , ' @entity5 told @entity19 on tuesday , the 14th day of the 90 - day death sentence he was given by doctors			1
' ( but ) if i 'm going to die without @entity78 having talked to me i would consider that a major failure for him as well as me			1
' @entity5 wants to press mr @entity78 to consider a conscience vote on the issue - something that was recommended by a @entity68 committee early in november			1
a former executive at @entity93 and @entity94 , @entity5 is the subject of a new documentary , fade to @entity97 , which concerns his fight for voluntary euthanasia in @entity2			2
he has helped raised more than $ 100,000 for the film			0
in the trailer of his forthcoming documentary , @entity5 says : ' i will go out of my wonderful life at a time of my choosing with my dog @entity108 's ears in my hands and my family by my side ' on friday , @entity5 will ride in his @entity50 through the @entity53 line of road to a freshwater dam in the @entity55			1
there , he will paddle with his son the cancer ( the white bits in the above graphic ) has metastasised to his lungs ' i will go out of my wonderful life at a time of my choosing with my dog @entity108 's ears in my hands and my family by my side , ' he said in the film 's trailer			1
there are parallels between his situation and that of @entity127 , the 29 - year - old @entity128 woman who killed herself as her body began to succumb to the ravages to brain cancer			2
voluntary euthanasia is the practice of ending a life in a painless manner			0
in some parts of the world , including @entity140 , @entity141 , the @entity142 , @entity143 , and the @entity128 states of @entity145 and @entity146 , some forms of voluntary euthanasia are legal			2
in 1996 in @entity2 the @entity147 passed the world 's first euthanasia legislation , the @entity150			0
four patients died through assisted suicide under the @entity150 , but the legislation was overturned by @entity2 's @entity154 in 1997			0
@entity5 said he felt like a friend had died when ms @entity127 died last month			2
' we 're the two souls who , for whatever reason , have found themselves in similar spots , ' he explained to @entity19			0
ms @entity127 went on an extensive media campaign to promote voluntary euthanasia prior to her death			0
she tearfully told @entity164 : ' i do n't want to die			0
' if anyone wants to hand me a magical cure and save my life so that i can have children with my husband , you know , i will take them up on it			0
' ' anyone who has walked a mile in my shoes and knows what they 're facing and has felt the just bone - splitting headaches i get sometimes or the seizures or the inability to speak or the moments when i 'm looking at my husband 's face and i ca n't remember his name ... ' despite his tragic condition - the cancer has metastasised in his lungs - @entity5 told @entity19 : ' i can do something good at the end of my life			1
' it 's great leadership for my son			2
and , you know , everyday 's a ball			0
' over the past year , he has had a stream of farewell events with family and friends where he has said a ' little speech ' - but he has lived to tell the tale			0
' you never know what 's around the next corner , ' he said			0
' it 's always another exciting something happening			0
' sooner or later , i 'm going to turn around a corner and say 's * * * it looks like it 's all coming to an end			0
' his main fear is not death , but rather the pain he and his family will experience			0
@entity5 hopes to live until the end of february			1
lifeline 13 11 14 @entity5 , right , served as the general manager of @entity220 good times : @entity5 is pictured with wife @entity29 on holidays			2

@entity5 , 57 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , has terminal oesophageal cancer
doctors believe he will die in the next *76* days , but he hopes to live for as long as possible
