in @entity1 ’s dreams , wednesday night ends with him celebrating like it is 2009			1
@entity5 blow @entity6 away , their stuttering season catches fire and more memories are created to last a lifetime			1
his nightmares , however , involve an embarrassment , of @entity5 finding themselves on the receiving end of a scoreline similar to the 4 - 0 drubbing they administered to @entity6 , when these teams last collided five years ago			1
the first scenario , he believes , is possible , particularly if @entity20 ’ side are swept along on a wave of emotion			0
if @entity5 use the energy that a highly - charged @entity25 crowd will give them , @entity1 hopes they can swarm all over @entity6			1
the @entity39 international was well prepared for the adverse weather and wore a snood on his head as cover for the duration of the session			0
click here for the full story but the second picture , @entity1 recognises , is also possible , especially if one member of @entity5 ’s starting line - up approaches this contest with the mindset that they can coast through 90 minutes , not pushing themselves to the limit			1
for @entity5 to defy the odds , no passengers are permitted			1
‘ that applies to me personally as well , ’ @entity1 said			2
‘ everyone who is picked to play — from the 11 in the starting line - up to the subs on the bench — everyone has to be on their game			2
we are playing against the best side in @entity68 and if we have two or three passengers , we get beat convincingly			2
‘ it can become embarrassing against sides like this who are deadly away from home on the counter-attack			0
we need to be right on it			0
but when big questions get asked of this team — especially last year when big hitters came to town — we raised our game			0
‘ the fans raised their game , we raised ours and put in some really good performances			0
i think a ( big ) performance is due now			0
@entity86 was n’t good enough , everyone knows that , but everyone will respect that when @entity6 come into town it ’s a different game to get up for			1
‘ every player in the dressing room realises we ca n’t have any passengers or we will get beat convincingly			0
i can understand that ( many people are predicting a @entity6 win )			2
most places they go , with the current players and the form they are in , they are expected to win most games they play			0
‘ i understand those opinions but shocks are there , upsets happen			0
yes , we understand we are the underdogs but with the atmosphere we have here and the players raising their game for a night like this , i think it is possible to cause an upset			2
’ @entity1 celebrates scoring his team 's third goal during the @entity114 win against @entity6 in 2009 @entity1 hopes @entity5 can recreate another magical night like the one in 2009 against @entity6 at @entity25 @entity5 best beware of real star @entity33 given the way @entity5 played at @entity117 on sunday , many would find it difficult to see why the captain has such optimism			1
@entity5 ’s play has been scruffy and inconsistent this season and logic dictates that it should be no different , especially against a side of @entity6 ’s undoubted class			1
but this , remember , is @entity25 on a @entity28 night			1
this is the stadium where logic is often defied on such occasions , when the improbable has been made possible			0
@entity1 has been a key protagonist in the drama since the turn of this century , not least on march 10 , 2009			1
‘ looking back at the game , the reason we came out on top was because we were aggressive with and without the ball , ’ said @entity1 , who scored two of @entity5 ’s four goals			1
‘ we pressed from the front and had a world - class talent in ( @entity142 ) @entity141 and we forced them into mistakes			0
i ca n’t give away tactics but with due respect to the team in 2009 individually @entity6 have improved so we have huge respect for their current team			1
‘ we need to enjoy the game but you only enjoy games like this when you play as a team			0
we ’re looking to shock a few people			0
’ there were times during a five - year absence from the @entity114 when @entity1 admitted to being consumed with envy towards those who had taken @entity5 ’s place and it is why he makes a point of re-emphasising this is not simply an occasion to enjoy			1
‘ i think all the hard work @entity168 has done and the lads have done ( means ) we deserve nights like these , ’ said @entity1 , for whom this will be a 127th @entity28 appearance			2
‘ i just hope no - one from the outside thinks we are just going into these games to enjoy ourselves			0
i hope nobody thinks we are settling for being in the @entity114			2
‘ @entity6 are top opposition and probably the best side in @entity68 but we want to give a good account of ourselves			1
this is a great opportunity for us to put in a really strong performance			0
’ it is time , then , for @entity5 to prove that the spellbinding play of last season was not a flash in the pan			2
they might be comparative novices in this competition but , as 34 - year - old @entity1 points out , that will count for nothing when the whistle blows			1
@entity1 and manager @entity20 spoke to the press ahead of @entity5 's clash with @entity6 @entity194 's new striker @entity193 sent @entity1 a message on @entity196 ahead of @entity6 's visit , writing : ' good luck for tomorrow ! ' ‘ i do n’t think any of us expect a year ’s leeway , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ in the time i ’ve been here i have never experienced supporters saying “ oh it is just nice to be in @entity114 ; it does n’t matter how you do , you will get judged next year ”			2
‘ we will get judged against the best side in @entity68			0
the message to the players is simple : we need a performance			0
‘ i am pretty confident that we can surprise a few people but that is how i am			0
i go into games with optimism , rather than fearing individuals and the opposition			0
’ his team - mates must follow suit if @entity1 ’s dream is to come true			1
@entity1 believes @entity5 can pull off a win against @entity222 giants @entity6 on wednesday night @entity1 does not want his @entity5 side to be embarrassed and has called for no hiding away on wednesday @entity225 @entity5 host real in @entity28 epic			1
