by @entity0 thousands of @entity2 patients are being forced to wait weeks for vital cancer tests – potentially putting their lives at risk			1
the @entity2 recommends that no one should wait longer than six weeks after being referred by their gp for a diagnostic test			1
but the latest official figures show that in april , almost 17,000 patients waited longer than the limit – more than double the total in the same month last year and almost five times the figure at the time of the last election in 2010			1
the number is also the highest for six years , suggesting that progress made in recent years to tackle the problem has stalled			1
17,000 patients waited over six weeks after their referral from a gp for a diagnostic test ( library image ) it comes just two weeks after official figures revealed that the target of 85 per cent of cancer patients starting treatment within two months of a gp referral has not been met for the first time since 2009			1
the latest total of 16,981 patients includes 3,427 waiting more than six weeks for endoscopy tests that detect bowel and stomach cancers – up from 2,037 last april , and 976 in 2010			1
there were 6,117 patients waiting for ultrasound tests , up from 1,326 last year , and 291 at the election			0
some 2,439 waited too long for @entity41 scans , compared with 374 at the election , and 859 were kept waiting for @entity40 , compared with 215 in 2010			0
charities blamed short staffing and a lack of @entity41 and ct machines for the problems			0
@entity47 , of @entity48 , said : ‘ these latest figures are extremely worrying and urgent action must be taken to make sure patients do n’t have to wait too long to get their cancer diagnosed			1
‘ the six - week waiting time target is in place as we know a quick diagnosis of cancer and access to treatment is vital to improving survival from the disease			0
' patients need assurance that suspected cancer is taken seriously and prioritised by the @entity2			2
’ @entity65 , of @entity66 , said : ‘ only two weeks ago we heard that more people are waiting longer to start treatment and now more people are waiting longer just to get diagnosed			2
charities blamed short staffing and a lack of @entity41 ( pictured ) and ct machines for the long waiting times			0
some 2,439 waited too long for mri scans last year ' once again we see that cancer care in this country is n’t fixed			0
the @entity2 is under strain and cancer risks being overlooked and not given the focus it needs			2
’ last night the @entity82 announced that an extra £ 250million was being given to hospitals and gp - led organisations to keep waiting times down			0
it follows figures showing that an extra 250,000 patients are waiting for planned surgery or treatment compared to this time last year			2
the department said the increase was partly due to the ageing population , which means more patients are being referred by @entity97 .			0

@entity2 say no one should wait longer than six weeks for diagnostic test
but latest figures show in april 17,000 patients waited longer than
highest for six years , suggesting attempts to tackle problem has stalled
