the bright lights of the city often lure people in with promises of a better way of life			0
today , around 3.9 billion people around the world live in towns and cities , with the global urban population growing by about one million people each week			2
but while urban dwellers may have better access to doctors and hospitals , there are growing concerns that city - living is severely damaging to health			1
rat race : the @entity22 - based @entity21 has launched a programme that aims to understand how a city environment can be changed to improve the health of its residents now , scientists at the @entity21 have launched a global programme to find out exactly how factors such as pollution , overcrowding and crime are affecting overall wellbeing			1
the ' @entity35 and @entity36 ' hopes to understand what makes a ' healthy urban environment ' , according to a report by @entity40 in the @entity41			0
' we are facing global epidemics of non-communicable diseases - heart disease , diabetes and so on - and mental health problems , ' professor @entity42 , director of the @entity44 's @entity43 , told the @entity41			1
packed : the programme claims that city - dwellers have higher rates of mental illness due to stress and social isolation			1
those living in cities also suffer worse from impacts from car pollution ' we are also seeing the health impact of climate change , such as heat - stress in cities and changes in the distribution of infectious vector - borne diseases			1
' women who live in urban areas are more likely to develop postnatal depression than those who live in the countryside , recent research has claimed			0
women who live in large cities are three per cent more likely to develop the condition five to 14 months after giving birth			0
the researchers believe this could be because city living is more stressful and is associated with less supportive communities			0
dr @entity81 , at @entity82 , in @entity83 , said : ' living in an urban area is a marker of more stress , less support and a potentially higher risk of postpartum depression for women			2
' our study suggests we need to better target our supports and services towards women based on their geographic location to improve their outcomes and reduce their risk of postpartum depression			2
' for instance , the programme claims that city - dwellers have higher rates of mental illness due to stress and social isolation			1
it is also looking at how infectious diseases thrive when people are crowded together , or how they emerge when cities expand into surrounding areas			0
' the demographic advantage of youth in such countries would be lost unless combined with healthy living ' said @entity115 , chair of the @entity116 at the @entity21			2
' policy makers face the challenge of viewing healthy cities as ' systems ' consisting of multiple subsystems along with the overarching super system of climate change			0
' but professor @entity42 said that the programme could offer some hope , by combining expertise between scientists and urban planners on how to better develop cities			1
the programme will look at everything from the design of public spaces and transport to improvements in housing and free city services			1
professor @entity42 says the key is understanding that cities are really about people			0
' we are attracted to cities for economic , educational and social opportunities , ' he said ' when we live in cities , they need to work for us			2
it is not just about the economic efficiencies			0

@entity21 is looking at how cities affect health
it claims city - dwellers have higher rates of mental illness due to stress
they lead a more sedentary *lifestyle* and suffer from impact of pollution
programme aims to combine expertise of scientists and urban planners
they want to improve the design of housing , parks and public services
it warns that if nothing is changed , economic opportunities could be lost
