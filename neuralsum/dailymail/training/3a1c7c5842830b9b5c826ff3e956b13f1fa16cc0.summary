by @entity0 a new interactive map of the @entity2 shows that a staggering 47 percent of the country remains unoccupied			1
the map is the work of @entity6 who created it using information from the 2010 census			1
the @entity11 breaks the nation down into blocks for tabulating statistics			2
as of the 2010 census , the @entity2 consists of 11.1 million census blocks			1
a new interactive map of the @entity2 shows that a staggering 47 percent of the country remains unoccupied - the green represents the blocks where no one lives the blocks are not all the same size , as the bureau creates boundaries based on factors such as major borders , rivers and streets			1
more than 4.8 million of the blocks totaling 4.61 million square kilometers were reported to have no population living inside them , according to the research			1
a single inhabitant is enough to make a block inhabited			0
so despite having a population of more than 310 million people , 47 percent of the country remains unoccupied , writes blogger @entity37			1
although most of the zero - population zones - depicted in green - are uninhabitable due to being natural habitats such as rivers and forests , other inhabitable blocks include large factories , airports and office buildings			2
just because a block is unoccupied , that does n’t mean it is undeveloped			0
@entity49 and @entity50 are both states that feature large areas that are uninhabitable due to geography such as mountains the map shows a significant difference between the eastern and western halves of the country			0
while unpopulated places are more likely to stand out in the east of the map , it is the population centers which stand out more against the wilderness areas of the west of the country			2
@entity6 has created an interactive map that allows users to zoom into any area of the @entity2			1
‘ at the local level , city and county parks emerge in contrast to their developed urban and suburban surroundings , ’ @entity37 wrote in his blog			0
‘ at this scale , even major roads such as highways and interstates stretch like ribbons across the landscape			0
’ ‘ ultimately , i made this map to show a different side of the @entity2			2
human geographers spend so much time thinking about where people are			0
i thought i might bring some new insight by showing where they are not , adding contrast and context to the typical displays of the country ’s population geography			0
’ if densely populated cities such as @entity98 , left , are n't your thing , perhaps you should look to move to @entity49 , right , where the population is considerably less			0
