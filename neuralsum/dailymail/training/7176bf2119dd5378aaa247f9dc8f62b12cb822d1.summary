@entity4 , flush from their £ 220million shirt sponsorship deal with @entity3 , are now following the @entity6 route by looking for a training kit backer as well			1
@entity4 , no doubt , will be looking to get as near as they can to the £ 120m figure over eight years that @entity6 have attracted from @entity11 insurance giants @entity10 for training gear branding as well as title sponsorship of their @entity15 training complex			1
@entity16 also have separate training kit sponsors in @entity19 airline @entity18			1
@entity3 mr @entity20 with @entity21 during the announcement of @entity4 's @entity23 mr @entity24 and mr @entity20 with the @entity4 boss and chairman @entity26 after the announcement @entity4 had been lagging behind @entity6 in the sponsorship stakes but the @entity3 agreement , worth £ 38m annually for five years plus another potential £ 30m in bonuses , has fully vindicated demanding owner @entity32 ’s desire to challenge for the no 1 position on and off the pitch			1
@entity4 ’s new commercial chief @entity35 hired outside agency @entity36 , run by two former @entity6 executives , to help with his sponsorship hunt			1
their success in bringing in the second highest @entity42 shirt sponsorship from a standing start last october further exposes the @entity46 commercial department ’s chronic year - long failure to land an @entity48 sponsor			1
@entity6 have attracted trainig kit sponsorship from @entity11 insurance giants @entity10 @entity52 president @entity51 says it is business as usual for his @entity55 staff , who have been told not to get involved in any electioneering that would be in breach of regulations that were not in place last time @entity51 faced competition for his crown			1
however , @entity52 and @entity51 — bidding for a fifth term — are so intertwined it is impossible for the communications team not to effectively support @entity51 in their day - to - day work			2
so , unless the president forms a stand - alone campaign team , he is making a mockery of the election process			2
but fifa have insisted that @entity51 was not intending to set up a separate election operation as he was not campaigning			2
@entity52 president @entity51 arrives for the @entity71 in @entity72 the most awkward moment at the @entity75 summit in @entity76 so far was @entity46 chairman @entity78 ’s quick welcome handshake with @entity51			2
but 78 - year - old @entity51 ’s remarkably sunny disposition in @entity72 was down , he admitted , to being accompanied by his glamorous 50 - year - old girlfriend @entity80			2
the @entity75 delegates , after being entertained last night at @entity81 by first minister @entity82 , are dining at the @entity84 tonight , although @entity51 shows no sign of sinking			0
lord @entity87 is in campaign mode on the @entity90 presidential election trail , taking in @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 in one week			0
@entity87 ’s rival @entity94 , who has yet to make any policy announcement , chose to go to the @entity97 executive committee in @entity98 , where there were no votes to canvass			0
this allowed @entity87 to have the stage to himself in the south of @entity104 , where 23 voting athletics federations were present			0
lord @entity87 is in campaign mode on the @entity90 presidential election trail , taking in @entity91 and @entity92 @entity106 blows hot and cold @entity106 's @entity107 2022 organising committee took the @entity52 task force delegates out for dinner in @entity111 at an open - air restaurant after agreeing to a november - december scheduling of the tournament because of the intense heat in the summer			0
ironically , it was so cold for the diners that blankets had to be brought out to keep them warm			0
the @entity46 of @entity121 president @entity120 and vice president @entity122 are still insisting that the gentlemen ’s agreement between the @entity125 chiefs from the 2011 @entity75 meeting at @entity127 is relevant today			0
that would mean it is @entity121 ’s turn to provide the @entity42 vice-president on the @entity132			0
but the three other countries regard the changes in statutes that see the whole of @entity138 voting for the @entity42 place voiding that pact			0
so @entity120 , much to his chagrin , will miss out on the $ 200,000 - a - year stipend plus $ 500 a day and expenses as @entity146 ’s @entity145 , already on the @entity147 , is a certainty to be elected			0
it ’s a sign of the times that neither the @entity4 or @entity152 owner will attend the vip lunch for the @entity155 finalists at @entity156 tomorrow			1
@entity4 owner @entity32 prefers to attend games surrounded by his own @entity160 entourage while @entity152 ’s @entity161 rarely goes to games — even cup finals			1
@entity4 chairman @entity26 and his @entity152 counterpart @entity165 will head their club ’s delegations			1
@entity165 will head @entity152 's club delegations at the @entity155 vip lunch at @entity156			0

blues *recently* agreed a £ 220million kit deal with @entity176
@entity6 agreed a £ *120million* deal for their training kit
@entity4 will be looking to seal a *similar* deal as they play catch up
