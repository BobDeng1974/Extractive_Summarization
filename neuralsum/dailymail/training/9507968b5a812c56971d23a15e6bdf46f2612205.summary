@entity0 yesterday rejected @entity2 ’s attack on the ‘ shocking ’ domination of public life by a private school elite			1
the prime minister insisted he believes ‘ what counts is not where you come from but where you are going ’			2
but in his second speech to damage the government in a month , sir @entity2 told @entity13 activists he was ‘ outraged on behalf of the people abandoned when social mobility is lost ’			1
sir @entity2 's speech comes at a time of deepening unease over the decline in social mobility that had , in the post-war years , let many children from working and lower - middle class backgrounds rise to the top the former prime minister added : ‘ in every single sphere of @entity30 influence , the upper echelons of power in 2013 are held overwhelmingly by the privately educated or the affluent middle class			1
‘ our education system should help children out of the circumstances in which they were born , not lock them into the circumstances in which they were born			2
' we need them to fly as high as their luck , their ability and their sheer hard graft can actually take them			2
and it is n’t going to happen magically			2
’ sir @entity2 , who is the son of a circus performer and garden gnome salesman , left school with only three o - levels mr @entity0 , who went to @entity46 , is vulnerable to charges that his cabinet is dominated by a privileged elite			1
and some wavering @entity50 believe he should change tack and bring back grammar schools to help poorer children			0
but mr @entity0 ’s spokesman said : ‘ at the heart of this is the importance of building what the prime minister has described as an aspiration nation			0
he has said what counts is not where you come from but where you are going			0
‘ that ’s why we have put education reform and welfare reform at the heart of government policy			0
the prime minister is saying we need to unleash and unlock the promise in everybody			0
what parents really want to know is that the government has policies to ensure their kids can fulfil their talents and ambitions			0
’ sir @entity2 ’s speech comes at a time of deepening unease over the decline in social mobility that had , in the post-war years , let many children from working and lower - middle class backgrounds rise to the top			1
sir @entity2 , who is the son of a circus performer and garden gnome salesman , left school with only three o - levels			1
on the lack of children from less affluent backgrounds in powerful positions , he said : ‘ to me , from my background , i find that truly shocking			0
’ he blamed the @entity98 and @entity99 governments for leaving a ‘ @entity102 divide between stagnation and aspiration ’			0
in october , in the wake of @entity99 leader @entity107 ’s promise of a freeze on energy prices , sir @entity2 called for a windfall tax on energy companies and spoke of ‘ net - curtain poverty ’			1
@entity13 mp @entity113 said the loss of selective schools was a major factor in denying progress to the underprivileged : ‘ i came from a council estate where the way out was to get to a grammar school			2
’ @entity122 , the @entity13 financial secretary to the treasury and the son of a bus driver , suggested the @entity74 was working to address sir @entity2 ’s concerns			1
‘ the important thing is that this government continues to put forward its policies on education , on welfare , on the economy , ’ he added .			0
