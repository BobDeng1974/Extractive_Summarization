by @entity0 published : 11:41 est , 9 january 2013 updated : 23:36 est , 9 january 2013 we thought we ’d seen off the second - wettest year on record – but now scientists have found that 2012 has left a legacy of less nutritious vegetables and fruit			0
the heavy rain is being blamed for a reduced mineral content in a host of @entity11 crops			1
vital natural chemicals such as nitrates and sulphites were washed away , leaving many fruits , cereals and vegetables depleted			1
depleted : heavy rain in 2012 is being blamed for reduced mineral content in @entity11 crops , with vital nutrients such as nitrates and sulphates washed away the deluge ‘ leeched ’ crops of vital substances , according to one expert			1
some wheat harvests were found to have a third less iron and zinc than average			0
a lack of sunshine last year has also led to some edible plants having reduced nutritional value			1
the findings are particularly bad news for non-meat eaters , who can not easily get key nutrients such as iron , copper and zinc from other food sources			2
@entity43 , a professor of crop science and agronomy from @entity46 , said that nitrogen , which is crucial for plants to manufacture protein , is present in the soil as soluble salts and can be washed away by heavy rain			1
he said : ‘ you need nitrogen to help the plant absorb iron			2
so we would expect to see less iron in last year ’s harvest because of the wet weather			0
‘ plants ca n’t manufacture minerals , so if there are less of them in the soil , it stands to reason that there will be less of them in the crop			0
‘ when you get a lot of leeching because of heavy rain close to harvest , then you will have a knock - on effect on the quality of the crop			1
‘ it is very obvious in cereals and the ensuing bread , and root crops like carrots , potatoes and parsnips			2
’ prof @entity43 also warned that fewer sunny days has resulted in less sugar and starch in our fruit , making it taste different			1
delicious : but fruit and veg in @entity11 has been threatened by wet weather and a lack of sunny days causing less starch and sugar to be produced washout : @entity46 's @entity43 said that nitrogen is present in the soil as soluble salts and can be washed away by heavy rain but he said there is no need to consume more than the recommended five - a - day amount of fruit and veg			1
prof @entity43 ’s advice is to vary your diet and ensure you eat produce harvested from diverse locations and grown at different times of year			1
‘ with the diversity of fruit and veg on offer , there is no real reason for @entity11 consumers to suffer from a nutritional point of view , ’ he said			1
but vegans and vegetarians may struggle with their limited diet , warned professor @entity117 , an expert in soil protection at @entity119			0
‘ the wet weather has had an effect on the amount of nutrients in grains , fruit and vegetables			2
‘ last year ’s cereals we tested have been found to contain a third less iron and zinc than you would normally expect			0
’ he said the wet weather had two effects on the crops			2
firstly , it removed nitrogen from the soil			2
without it plants struggle to absorb other nutrients			0
@entity141 : professor @entity43 also warned that fewer sunny days has resulted in less sugar and starch in our fruit , making it taste different the second reason is that the wet weather benefitted some wheat crops , which had a bountiful harvest , diluting the amount of nutrients available for each grain			1
but not all scientists agree that home - grown produce had suffered after the downpours			0
@entity157 , head of @entity158 at the @entity159 , said : ‘ there is little direct evidence that the poor weather has drastically reduced nutrient content in fruit and vegetables			1
‘ most crops are efficient in obtaining the nutrients they need and so would contain a “ normal ” range of nutrients			0
the largest effect would be on water - soluble compounds such as nitrates , but most farming systems supply this through fertilisers			0
‘ some water - soluble vitamins may be reduced , such as vitamin c in potatoes			0
however , in the overall diet it makes little impact as we get our nutrients from a wide range of different fruit and veg			0
‘ the major effect the weather has had is on reducing overall yield , which in turn increases prices			0

heavy rain is being blamed for reduced mineral content in @entity11 crops
@entity46 's @entity43 said that nitrogen can be washed away
he said that *process* known as ' leeching ' can effect the quality of crops
fewer sunny days has also resulted in less sugar and starch in food
