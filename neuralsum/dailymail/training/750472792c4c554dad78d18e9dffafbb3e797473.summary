a war of words broke out between the @entity2 and the @entity3 yesterday over its bungled bailout of @entity5			1
the @entity2 admitted to ‘ notable failures ’ in the handling of the @entity5 crisis and accused @entity10 officials of being more concerned with saving the euro than rescuing the debt - ridden country			1
the fund , headed by @entity15 , said it was forced to break its own rules for providing financial assistance to bankrupt countries because @entity3 leaders refused to take action to solve the crisis			2
blunder : the @entity2 has admitted mishandling the @entity5 debt crisis , leading to violent anti-austerity protests like this demonstration in @entity25 last november the @entity2 report , drawn up by staff at the watchdog ’s headquarters in @entity30 , triggered a furious response in @entity32 where the @entity33 said it was ‘ plainly wrong and unfounded ’			1
a spokesman for @entity35 , @entity10 commissioner for economic affairs , said : ‘ we fundamentally disagree			0
’ @entity38 was forced to find more than £ 1billion to prop up @entity5 , and in turn the euro , through the @entity38 ’s membership of the @entity2			1
@entity43 , of the @entity44 ’ @entity42 , said : ‘ taxpayers were roped into bailing out @entity5 via the back door			2
now it turns out they botched even that			0
the eurozone built itself on a debt bubble and it ’s scandalous that hard - pressed families are shouldering even a penny of that bill			0
’ the @entity2 and the @entity3 granted @entity5 a £ 93billion bailout in may 2010			1
the fund now admits there were serious mistakes in the way it and @entity3 officials handled the bailout			2
@entity61 battles : protesters and police have repeatedly clashed as the country 's economy has shrunk the report said the catalogue of errors – including harsh austerity measures on @entity5 – plunged the country deeper into crisis			1
@entity5 is in its sixth consecutive year of recession with unemployment at 27 per cent and youth unemployment at 62.5 per cent – meaning more than six in ten young @entity5 who want a job can not find one			0
the @entity2 said the ‘ dramatic contraction ’ in the @entity5 economy was driven by the refusal of @entity10 officials to consider writing off the country ’s debts as early as 2010			1
the debt burden was eventually restructured last year – meaning investors were paid less than what they were owed as the burden on @entity5 was partially lifted			0
‘ not tackling the public debt problem decisively at the outset or early in the programme created uncertainty about the euro area ’s capacity to resolve the crisis and likely aggravated the contraction in output , ’ said the @entity2 report			1
fury : many @entity5 blame outsiders such as @entity102 chancellor @entity101 for the deep recession ‘ an upfront debt restructuring would have been better for @entity5 although this was not acceptable to the euro partners			0
’ the @entity2 said the rescue packages were nothing more than a ‘ holding operation ’ to give the eurozone ‘ time to build a firewall to protect other vulnerable members ’ – in other words , an attempt to save the euro whatever it meant for @entity5			1
‘ market confidence was not restored , the banking system lost 30 per cent of its deposits , and the economy encountered a much deeper than expected recession with exceptionally high unemployment , ’ said the @entity2			0
the @entity3 insisted that writing off @entity5 debt as suggested by the @entity2 would have led to ‘ devastating consequences ’ as investors fretted about losses in other eurozone countries			2
a spokesman said : ‘ with hindsight we can go back and say in an ideal world what should have been done differently			0
the circumstances were what they were			0
i think the @entity33 did its best in an unprecedented situation			0

@entity2 report admits fund forced austerity measures on @entity5 too *quickly*
@entity2 also failed to restructure country 's debts at the start of crisis
@entity5 politicians welcome @entity2 's *confession* and call for change of course
