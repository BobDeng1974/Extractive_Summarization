commonly referred to as super tides , spring tides or ' super moon ' tides , they are governed by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun. in a blog on its website , @entity6 analysts said these tides occur when the pull of the sun and moon align and combine			1
when the gravitational pulls offset each other , we get smaller tides known as neap tides			2
we are currently at the height of these pull increases			0
the experts added : ' however , there is a longer cycle at work too , associated with the gravitational pull of the planets in the solar system			0
' this means we can see additional , albeit relatively small , increases and decreases in the size of spring and neap tides over long periods of time			2

photographer @entity316 said : ‘ i do n’t think the deer were bothered			0
they normally move around and find higher ground			0
‘ but the volume and speed [ yesterday ] was a different level			2
they must have thought “ oh , we better get out of here ”			0
‘ they are obviously very good swimmers			0
they just got to higher ground , had a bit of a shake and then basked in the sun for a while			0
’ unhurt : it was one of five deer that did not expect the sheer volume and speed in which the wetlands was flooded spotted : the photographer said the deer which escaped the flooded wetland are ' obviously very good swimmers ' and made it to higher ground			0
