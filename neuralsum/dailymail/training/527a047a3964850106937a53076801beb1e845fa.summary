by @entity0 published : 19:01 est , 25 december 2012 updated : 06:08 est , 26 december 2012 @entity1 has leapfrogged @entity2 in the global economic league tables , regaining the sixth place lost to the @entity6 country this time last year			1
the @entity1 is also breathing down @entity9 ’s neck , with our economy likely to overtake that of our nearest neighbours some time in 2013			1
but @entity1 will be overhauled in the next decade by both @entity14 and @entity15 , while @entity2 will regain the place it lost this year by 2014			1
moving up : @entity1 ( @entity17 , left ) has leapfrogged @entity2 ( @entity18 , right ) in global economic league tables the league table is issued by authoritative @entity22 forecaster the @entity23 and @entity24			1
it also looks ahead to 2022 , when emerging economies are expected to take their place at the top table			2
while the @entity30 will cling on to its place at the top of the league in 2022 , according to the @entity34 , @entity29 is closing the gap fast			0
as it stands , the @entity29 economy is 53 per cent the size of its @entity30 rival , but it will have risen to 83 per cent by 2022			0
@entity39 will remain in third , but fourth - placed @entity41 is likely to be overtaken by the meteoric @entity14 economy , which will also leave the @entity1 trailing in its wake within five years			1
@entity34 chief executive @entity44 said : ‘ the @entity14 have lost to us at cricket this winter but they are on track to beat us at economics			2
by 2017 we predict that the @entity14 economy will be the largest in the @entity50			2
’ @entity1 can take heart from the fact that the country is expected to retain its top ten place , despite the rapid growth seen in the developing world , and to overtake the @entity9			1
the @entity57 said @entity9 was being held back by the economic policies of president @entity59 , who has slapped the rich with sky - high taxes			0
‘ we are poised to overtake @entity9 either in 2013 or 2014 as the economic effects of president @entity59 ’s 75 per cent tax policy and the difficulties of the euro drag @entity9 down , ’ said mr @entity44			1
leaders : just a year ago , @entity9 foreign minister @entity70 ( pictured left with chancellor @entity71 , right ) said : ' from an economic standpoint , we prefer being @entity9 than @entity1 ' just a year ago , @entity9 foreign minister @entity70 said that the outlook for @entity9 was better than that in the @entity1 , adding : ‘ from an economic standpoint , we prefer being @entity9 than @entity1			1
’ the @entity34 ’s predictions suggest quite the reverse , although many senior economists still believe that the @entity1 will follow @entity9 by losing its prized @entity80 credit rating in 2013			2
the government ’s anticipated failure to get @entity1 ’s debt - to - output ratio falling by 2015 has already seen ratings agencies put the economy on ‘ negative watch ’ , meaning it risks being downgraded			0
@entity88 ’s prospects are particularly poor , with the former @entity90 powerhouse expected to slide from eight in the world to thirteenth			0
the decline and fall of @entity93 will leave it languishing behind countries such as @entity96 and @entity97			0
@entity14 ’s surge from tenth to fourth will be seen as the biggest change in the balance of the global economy , but @entity103 is primed for its own meteoric rise			0
the world ’s fourth most populous country , with some 238million citizens , will leap from 16th to tenth .			0

@entity1 moves into sixth place and is likely to overtake @entity9 next year
but @entity1 is set to be overhauled in next decade by both @entity14 and @entity15
