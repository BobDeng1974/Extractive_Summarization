by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 05:54 est , 18 may 2013 updated : 15:28 est , 18 may 2013 the family of a @entity4 tourist who drowned in strong currents off the @entity7 coast have questioned why a red flag was not raised to warn against swimming in that area			1
@entity10 , 45 , was dragged under the water when he went for a mid-afternoon dip in the sea with his wife , @entity14 , yesterday afternoon			1
his family today said no life - guard was on duty and there was nothing to suggest conditions were treacherous on that stretch of the beach			1
dangerous currents : witnesses said mr @entity10 got into difficulties in the sea in front of the beachside @entity29 ( stock photo ) his sister - in - law @entity31 said relatives had been looking forward to the day trip to the seaside town of @entity35 , which came on the family holiday to @entity37			1
she today paid tribute to the ' incredible husband and father ' who would be ' sorely missed by everyone '			1
' we had all looked forward to our trip to @entity37 and googled the spectacular beaches of @entity35 , ' ms @entity31 said			2
' after arriving we ate lunch and @entity10 had a pizza and one glass of beer			1
he waited 30 - 40 minutes before going into the sea			1
there was no red flag , and later we found out no life guard on duty			2
' she said this meant the family ' completely underestimated ' the undercurrent which ' proved to be a fatal error '			2
the strong swimmer was said to have been overcome by the waves minutes after jumping into the water			2
his wife was pulled from the sea by her two sons , @entity65 and @entity66 but efforts to save mr @entity10 failed			1
tourism hotspot : @entity35 is about an hour and a half south of @entity37 and is a popular beach resort ms @entity31 said : ' @entity14 's son @entity65 and his brother @entity66 managed to pull @entity14 safely to shore and two unnamed persons eventually found @entity10			1
but we believe it was already too late			0
' members of the family , passers - by and eventually the ambulance tried in vain to resuscitate him			0
@entity10 was a strong swimmer , as were other members of the party , but a tragic accident occurred			1
' my sister and their children would like to come to terms with this without the need to defend decisions that were made that day			0
many thanks goes to everybody who helped , particularly the staff of the @entity96			0
' a woman , who did not give her name , said she had been at work in a hotel when a number of panicked tourists rushed in			0
' i was in the reception when people burst in to call for help , ' she said			0
' they said someone was in trouble in the water and we called an ambulance immediately			0
' i went outside and could see the man in the water			0
one of his sons was trying to rescue him but i think it was already too late			0
' tragic : mr @entity10 drowned after visiting the beach at @entity35 , @entity7 ( stock photo ) @entity120 , owner of the @entity29 , said : ' it all happened right in front of our hotel			1
the man who died had arrived with his wife and group of other @entity4 people in the morning to spend the day by the sea			1
' they had a very late lunch and ate and drank quite a bit , then they decided to go for a swim			0
' the sea was rough - it was n't the right sort of day to go into the water			2
' he hit problems right away and was dragged under by the currents and the waves , the sea was rough but i think the fact he had just had an abundant lunch probably did n't help either			1
' his wife and some of the others were also in difficulty but they managed to get out of the water			2
' it all happened in front of his poor wife			2
she was in a very bad way , very shocked			0
' a coastguard helicopter was scrambled to the scene and paramedics were also dispatched but mr @entity10 was declared dead at the scene and his body taken to the mortuary of a local hospital			1
the group , all from @entity164 , spent the night in the @entity29 hotel , while arrangements were made to repatriate mr @entity10 's body after a local magistrate gave the go ahead for it to be released			1
they are expected back in @entity4 today			1
holiday : the group had enjoyed a large lunch at a taverna in @entity35 before headed to the beach ( stock photo ) @entity176 , owner of the @entity178 restaurant , where the party had lunch said : ' it was such a tragic end to what should have been a beautiful day by the sea			1
they had come in here for lunch and had pizza and beers and they were all laughing and joking			0
' there must have been around ten of them all together , all men and women and there was a little girl as well			0
they were here for an hour , maybe more then they all went off to the beach			0
the weather was nice but the sea was rough , the waves were high and there was a strong wind as well			1
' the first we knew something had happened was a few minutes later when we heard all the noise , looked outside and saw the ambulance and the helicopter on the beach			0
the man was on the sand and they were pumping his chest but sadly there was nothing that could be done			0
' the area does n't have a lifeguard and it 's still early in the season and it happened midweek			0
if it was the summer there would have been a guard nearby			0
he must have been hit by a cramp after going in the water so soon after lunch			0
' a police spokesman in nearby @entity229 said : ' we were called to the scene and arrived along with paramedics and the coastguard , to a man who had got into difficulties in the sea			2
he was pulled from the water and cardiac massage was carried out but there was nothing that could be done			0
' his body was taken to a local hospital and his family spent the night in the hotel			2
the magistrate ruled there was no need for an autopsy and the body will be repatriated back to @entity4			1

@entity10 , *46* , was on holiday with his wife @entity14 and a party of friends
he was dragged under by strong currents moments after entering sea
the group are *due* back in @entity4 today and his body will be repatriated
