@entity40 were toothless and @entity96 ’s late strike was no consolation			1
for @entity21 , this performance could not have come at a better time			2
but it was n’t the smoothest of rides			0

with the lead — and with @entity40 brittle — @entity21 were going to prove hard to peg back and so it proved			1
when @entity87 tangled with @entity60 on the edge of @entity40 ’s area , referee @entity99 awarded a free - kick and @entity49 , who would later go off on a stretcher with an ankle problem , doubled @entity21 ’s advantage , his free - kick taking a hefty deflection off @entity51 ’ head			1
