by @entity0 - parkinson published : 05:06 est , 12 june 2012 updated : 14:12 est , 12 june 2012 fears @entity2 's government may need a massive bailout on top the € 100billion handed to its financial sector were heightened today as the cost of public borrowing soared to almost crisis levels			1
the interest rate on @entity2 10 - year bonds rose to 6.6 per cent - near to the 7 per cent level that forced @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 to request the rescue of their public finances			1
adding extra pressure on @entity2 was @entity19 's decision to downgrade the debt rating of 18 domestic banks due to their exposure to @entity2 government debt			1
last night the £ 80billion bailout for @entity2 banks was branded a ' sticking plaster ' and the euro tumbled now , following the @entity30 rescue of @entity2 's banks , there are fears that its financial sector may still fail and its own government will have to step in and pump in more cash			1
this could prompt an @entity38 bailout of the entire nation , especially interest rates reach the critical 7 per cent point that would make it difficult for @entity2 to raise enough cash on international money markets			1
yet , despite scepticism over @entity30 's move to rescue the @entity2 banking sector , markets across the globe made tentative gains today			1
@entity53 's @entity52 rose just 0.3 per cent , the @entity51 pared earlier gains to stand 0.2 per cent down , as did the @entity55 and @entity56 in @entity57 and @entity58			1
plans for a potential € 100 billion bailout for @entity2 's banks were initially warmly received before euphoria faded and the gravity of the eurozone crisis set in			1
warning : @entity66 finance minister @entity65 ( left ) has said @entity67 , led by @entity64 ( right ) , may soon have to be financially saved by the eurozone it has seen borrowing costs in @entity2 and @entity67 continuing their recent ascent			1
the bank rescue package in @entity2 was announced on saturday but is already being seen as little more than a sticking plaster for the eurozone 's troubles			2
@entity76 , analyst at @entity77 , said : ' despite the increasingly pressing need to resolve the growing @entity2 banking crisis , a very real possibility exists that a workable solution may not be forthcoming , leaving @entity2 banks to fail with significant adverse implications			2
' banks were under pressure with @entity86 off 2.8p to 187.8p and @entity87 slipping 2p at 219.4p			0
@entity88 , however , was up 0.2p at 28.7p , but this was only after the sale of its remittance business in @entity93 to @entity94			0
stock markets across @entity30 rose this morning but in @entity97 there were drops following @entity53 losses the fears that the banks bailout is already failing came as @entity66 's finance minister today said @entity67 , the eurozone 's third largest economy , may also imminently need a financial rescue because of its high borrowing costs			1
@entity65 's comments , which rose the stakes in @entity30 's debt crisis even further , amplified investors ' fears that @entity30 's leaders are far from ending almost three years of turmoil			1
she said : ' @entity67 has to work its way out of its economic dilemma of very high deficits and debt , but of course it may be that - given high rates @entity67 pays to refinance markets - they too will need support			1
' the market reaction suggests that ministers have failed to break the so - called doom loop between rising government debt , economic recession and teetering banks that previously drove @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 into @entity38 / @entity130 bailouts			1
analysts cited uncertainty about the mechanics of the @entity2 rescue package and fears that private bondholders could be subordinated to official lenders , risking losses in any debt restructuring , as they suffered in @entity11			1
' is this the next stage of a slippery slope in subordinating existing government bondholders ? ' asked @entity144 strategist @entity143 in a note to clients			0
investors are also worrying about the outcome of a @entity11 general election next sunday which may determine whether the country stays in the eurozone			0
@entity153 president @entity152 , @entity155 policymaker @entity154 and @entity157 finance minister @entity156 also all called today for swift moves to create a eurozone banking union			0
@entity152 told the @entity160 that a cross-border banking supervisor , a deposit guarantee scheme and a bank resolution fund could be put in place in 2013 without changing @entity38 treaties			0
@entity38 paymaster @entity166 has so far rejected a deposit guarantee or a resolution fund , saying they would require treaty change			0
@entity173 , which is home to the eurozone 's biggest financial centre but is not in the single currency and opposes closer @entity38 integration , should be allowed to opt out of such a union if it agreed not to block it , he said			0
@entity65 's typically outspoken comments came after @entity67 's industry minister dismissed the idea that @entity183 may need external help , saying reforms adopted by his government so far had put the @entity67 economy on a sound footing			2
her concerns are shared by one of the @entity166 government 's council of economic advisers , @entity194 , who said that @entity67 could be next in line			2
' overcoming the troubles in @entity2 will bring calm to the markets for a while , but the chances are not so small that @entity67 may also come under fire , in particular as the promised labour market reform has turned out to be less ambitious , ' @entity197 said			2
the @entity66 minister has a track record of speaking out of turn or undiplomatically			0
she angered @entity38 paymaster @entity166 last month by suggesting @entity11 might be forced out of the @entity38 over its economic problems			2
she infuriated @entity210 chairman @entity209 in march by rushing out to brief the media on a deal to increase the eurozone 's financial firewall before he could make the official announcement , forcing her to apologise			0
and when @entity219 treasury secretary @entity218 was invited to a eurozone finance ministers ' meeting in @entity222 last year to plead for a more robust rescue fund , @entity65 said bluntly that @entity224 should look after its own worse fiscal mess first			0
in @entity227 , @entity38 officials privately voiced exasperation at her latest comments on @entity67			0
a eurozone official said : ' the problem is that this is market sensitive			0
it 's one thing if journalists write this but quite another if a eurozone minister says it			0
verbal discipline is very important but she does n't seem to get that			0
' @entity67 's leading economic newspaper , @entity242 24 , appealed to @entity166 today to act to save the single currency before it is too late			2
' @entity245 ! ( hurry up mrs @entity245 ! ) , ' the usually sober business daily said in a banner headline in @entity166			0
an editorial urged chancellor @entity248 ' to make three choices quickly to save the euro and build a politically united @entity30 '			0
she should back guarantees for @entity30 bank deposits , allow direct access for banks to euro zone rescue funds and accept a mutualisation of @entity30 public debts , with each country paying a different interest rates			1
@entity67 has the eurozone 's second highest debt - to - gdp ratio after @entity11			1
@entity245 has opposed issuing joint euro zone bonds and says euro zone member states must agree to transfer more budget sovereignty to @entity30 institutions , including the @entity38 's @entity266 , as part of a political union before she would consider such idea .			2

interest rates on @entity2 bonds have risen to 6.6 *****%***** - close to 7 *****%***** level that forced @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 governments to seek bailouts
comes a week after @entity30 hands € 100billion to @entity2 's ailing banks

pressure compounded after @entity19 downgrades debt rating of 18 banks
