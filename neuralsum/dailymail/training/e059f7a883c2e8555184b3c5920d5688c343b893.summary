it 's not every day hundreds of tourists gather to worship at the spot of a severed tree branch			1
but in the tiny village of @entity6 , @entity7 , believers are coming from far and wide to pray next to a tree they believe contains an image of the @entity11			1
while it may not look so obvious to those without a large imagination ( and a strong will to believe ) religious villagers and tourists who are flocking to the site are so convinced of the likeness they insist it is a modern - day miracle			1
spot the difference : the ' miracle ' tree image ( left ) and a more traditional painting of the @entity11 ( right ) dozens of candles and flowers are being put daily in place at the foot of the tree as an offering to the image that they consider a miracle , despite skeptics saying it is nothing more than a pattern created by the tree rings			1
@entity40 is in the municipality of @entity42 in the south - eastern @entity7 state of @entity44 , where @entity45 and @entity46 recently visited			1
residents of the village say that the silhouette of the @entity50 suddenly appeared in the trunk of the @entity53 tree ( @entity52 ) and now locals are being joined by @entity55 faithful from far and wide			2
a 75 - year - old villager , @entity57 , discovered the image while on an afternoon stroll to her work as a cleaner at the local high school			1
' i have been working here for 18 years and always take this route and i can assure you that the image was not there before , ' she said			0
' i instantly had to tell my neighbours and when they came the word quickly spread			0
' scores of people from @entity7 's @entity72 ( above ) have flocked to @entity6 to see the image the tree stump in @entity75 , @entity76 , which had people visiting to pray in 2009 she said that soon people were arriving from far and wide to view the discovery of the ' @entity81 ' ( @entity50 )			1
another villager , @entity83 , 55 , said , ' many hundreds of people have come to meet her , they bought her flowers and candles			2
all the villagers that believe have come here to visit			0
' the director of the school where the cleaner was heading is @entity93 , 59 , who said : ' nothing like this has ever happened around here before , it must be a miracle			2
' @entity97 , 34 , is one of many who ignore the sceptics			0
' for me it is a miracle			0
i believe that @entity103 sent it to give us his blessing , so there will be an end to suffering , ' she said			0
the residents have planned a festival around the tree tomorrow ( december 12 )			0
they are also going to ask the regional bishop if the image in the piece of wood could be considered as an official miracle			0
the last time the @entity11 was ' seen ' in a tree was in 2009 when a tree stump in @entity75 , @entity76 , which workmen said bore her likeness was visited by believers with candles and prayers			1
sceptics said at the time that the believers were barking up the wrong tree .			2

a 75 - year - old cleaner first discovered the likeness in a tree in @entity7
hundreds of believers are coming to pray at the spot
religious villagers insist it should be recognised as a miracle
