your party shoes are primed or drinking boots are ready to be filled , but in a new city how will you know where to go ? it 's a most common travel predicament that a @entity8 party planner is keen to solve once and for all			1
whether it 's @entity12 , @entity13 or @entity8 , there 's a genuine risk in a strange city of spending the night wandering aimlessly into all the wrong places or , worse still , being herded into the tackiest of tourist ' hot spots '			1
@entity8 businessman @entity20 has launched @entity21 , a website connecting visitors to cities with their ' fixers ' across 14 countries , for this very reason			1
it 's already proving a hit with revellers , he says , and an app is set to launch this year			0
@entity33 in @entity32 charges $ 120 per night to arrange dinners , drinks and says he attracts vip treatment @entity8 businessman @entity20 is behind @entity38 's worldwide bespoke nightlife company the fixers , local movers and shakers , take a fee from groups keen to be squired around the city by those in the know , to hand - picked clubs , bars , restaurants and more			1
party tour guides , if you will , the fixers will spend as little or as much time with their clients as requested			2
their skill set includes securing passage through the most intimidating club security cordons or simply picking out and booking the best table in town - especially handy if you do n't speak the long language			0
' fixers ' such as @entity64 , an @entity65 artist based in @entity8 , apply to go on @entity38 's books and potential clients chose their host based on their advertised interests			1
@entity64 's specialty is trap , grime and hip - hop @entity20 , 27 , is also one of the @entity63 , and so far the only one on the @entity21 website to have received a user rating - both of them the maximum five stars from groups who rave about his bespoke evenings to the weirdest and most wonderful clubs @entity8 has to offer			1
his company , since launching in december , has spread quickly around some of the world 's most popular party destinations			0
he opened up applications for @entity63 from nations beyond the initial @entity88 and @entity89 , which has numerous fixers covering @entity8 and @entity91 on january 8			1
the fixers will help tourists get in to the most exclusive clubs in each city , such as @entity96 in @entity8 @entity97 is an art director who 's keen to show visitors around the top night spots in @entity100 , @entity101 the list of cities is growing daily and extends to @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity100 and @entity106 , with @entity107 and @entity13 in @entity108 also covered			1
' our fixers have had bookings from the @entity88 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity108 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity89 and more , ' says @entity20			0
' so far @entity8 has been by far our most in - demand city for bookings , with @entity12 seeing the highest number of @entity123 applications			1
' we now have fixers in 14 cities and this number is increasing daily			1
we only opened the platform to countries outside of the @entity89 this month so growth has been fast			0
' the site , set out almost like a dating page but for party - goers , has profiles for each of the fixers whose credentials for facilitating a terrific night out in their respective city have been assessed before they made the grade			0
potential clients and the fixers communicate via a secure messaging service before they are on the same page and are comfortable enough to exchange numbers			2
from there , high - end evenings in the most exclusive @entity12 clubs or a fun night of karaoke and dive bars can await			2
@entity104 - based @entity149 knows ' where to get the ultimate beans and beats ' in the land @entity154 while it 's a cinch to find @entity156 for a day in the sun , @entity149 leads clients to places @entity104 locals only know game designer @entity161 ( left ) can show clients around @entity165 's dive and karaoke bars while @entity166 - based @entity167 ( right ) says her ' crew is the movers and shakers of the local electronic music scene ' from their profiles , @entity38 's masters of the night are essentially keen to show clients a good time			1
some are local club promoters while others simply like to show off their cities best attributes			2
fixers tend to be from those who are n’t constrained by a 9 – 5 job , so we have a lot of creative types such as artists , actors , musicians , models and people in the fashion industry , or from those already working in the nightlife or hospitality industry , ' @entity20 says			0
' guests so far have been a mix of both leisure and business travellers but it ’s also occasionally being used by existing residents of a city			0
most have been in their late 20s and 30 ’s but we ’ve had interest and bookings from groups in their 40s , 50s and even 60s ! ' other cities on the books include @entity32 in the @entity210 , @entity104 in @entity211 , @entity106 in @entity212 , @entity166 in @entity213 , @entity105 in @entity214 , @entity100 in @entity101 , @entity107 and @entity13 in @entity108 and @entity215 in the @entity216			1
@entity97 takes her guests beyond the sights found in @entity100 brochures for 350 euros @entity107 's @entity220 works for a local party planning website while @entity12 's @entity222 assists a high - end crowd the exclusive clubs , bars and restaurants of @entity12 are accessible via a range of @entity12 experts @entity12 - based @entity222 , 37 , charges a hefty $ 350 for her @entity38 services			2
she specialises in the high - end of the market and claims to ' know everyone and their mother in @entity12			2
' @entity166 local @entity167 , 25 , is entrenched in the cosmopolitan @entity213 city 's electronic music scene but also knows her way around its extensive network of craft breweries and cocktail bars			0
in @entity165 , 33 - year - old @entity161 charges just $ 95 and is happy to help his guests have a big night out of dancing , an impromptu dive bar crawl or sing their hearts out at a karaoke club			0
if @entity156 and beats is your thing and you happen to be in @entity104 , @entity149 can lead you in the right direction while club promoter @entity250 , @entity38 's only @entity251 so far , guarantees that if there 's a vip section his clients will get access after his initial fee of 150 euros			1
the catch is that the price includes only the @entity63 ' services , their tailoring a night to the client 's needs , and not additional drinks , cover charges ( unless the fixer knows a loophole ) and transport			0
however the @entity123 can line up for your drinks and order you a taxi			0
@entity20 ( centre ) says @entity38 has already attracted clients from the @entity88 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity108 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity89 and more @entity8 , the city in which @entity38 was launched in december last year , is by far its most popular location @entity20 , enjoying a balloon pit at @entity8 's @entity275 , has five - star reviews on the site the be connected with a ' fixer ' , users simply go to the website , select their city of choice and scroll through their ever - growing database			1
fixers , should they be willing and able to meet the clients ' requests , are obliged to accompany their guests for six hours but can stay for less or more time if mutually agreed			2
@entity20 says his company offers authentic tastes of nightlife in the world 's most happening cities without needing to resort to a package club or organised bar crawl			0
@entity38 is an extension of @entity20 's company @entity297 , his introduction into the nightlife scene with which he organised a series of underground parties			0
the entrepreneur also claims to have introduced fish pedicures to the @entity89 after discovering them at a @entity306 night market and opened the short - lived @entity308 cereal restaurant .			0

@entity310 launched in december and now serves 14 countries
' fixers ' apply to host clients and design bespoke nights on the town
