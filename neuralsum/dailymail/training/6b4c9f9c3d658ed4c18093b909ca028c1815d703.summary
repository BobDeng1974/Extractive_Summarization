an artist from @entity1 has become the latest face of the ‘ @entity4 refugees ’ forced to flee to @entity5 to get decent healthcare			1
@entity7 , 60 , has a life - threatening pancreatic condition and needs a biopsy before it can be diagnosed and the correct treatment given			1
but the @entity11 in @entity1 has left her waiting for months before she can even see a consultant			2
@entity7 , 60 , from @entity1 , has a life - threatening pancreatic condition and is demanding the right to be treated on the @entity4 in @entity5 in desperation she has been forced to borrow from friends to afford the fees to see a private doctor in @entity19 , and now she is demanding the right to be treated on the @entity4 in @entity5			1
the @entity21 revealed two weeks ago that longer waiting times and poorer access to drugs mean thousands of @entity1 patients are now flocking across the border to be treated in @entity5 hospitals			1
the number of @entity1 cancer patients doing so has quadrupled from just 3,471 a decade ago to 15,450 last year			0
mrs @entity7 has now written to health secretary @entity30 , who runs the @entity4 in @entity5 , to plead for his help			1
she wrote : ‘ without timely @entity4 consultation , hundreds if not thousands of @entity1 patients , particularly those on the borders , are either paying privately , changing their addresses , moving house or dying before they even get on a waiting list			1
’ the scandal was brought up in the @entity40 yesterday by @entity42 mp @entity41 , who described his constituent @entity43 as an ‘ @entity4 refugee ’			0
the artist has a condition where only 10 per cent of her pancreas remains which , if it further deteriorates , could leave her with type 1 diabetes			0
she lives in @entity50 in @entity51 , south - east @entity1 - just a couple of miles from the @entity5 border			1
almost 50 per cent of @entity1 cancer patients must wait six weeks or more for vital scans and tests compared with a 1 per cent figure in @entity5 ( file picture ) a private consultant in @entity19 her that he would only be able to diagnose her condition after a biopsy - but her local @entity4 organisation , @entity66 health board , said it would not pay for the procedure in an @entity5 hospital			1
she has been waiting since last october to even be given a date to see a consultant in @entity1			1
‘ it has cost me £ 3,000 so far and i have had to borrow money from friends , ’ she told the @entity21			1
‘ i need regular tests and i am having to pay for them			0
‘ i am not well and i could do without all this hassle			0
the longer it takes , the more worried i am			0
i still have not seen a consultant			0
’ mrs @entity7 , who also has severe bowel problems , said she would only have to wait five or six weeks in @entity5			1
‘ i blame the @entity11 - run assembly and the way it has squandered money on other projects and now have no money left , ’ she said			0
‘ it looks as if the @entity4 is bankrupt , which is why they ’re stalling people			0
‘ i live right on the border and @entity19 is my nearest hospital and has the speciality i require			0
but they wo n’t pay for my treatment there - it ’s monstrous			0
‘ there is absolutely no choice in @entity1 - you do n’t know who you ’re going to see , when or where			0
’ during prime minister ’s questions yesterday , mr @entity41 said : ‘ my constituent @entity7 is seeking the right to be treated by the @entity5 - run @entity4			1
during prime minister 's questions yesterday , @entity100 accused @entity11 leader @entity103 of ' laughing ' at the failings of the @entity4 ‘ would you investigate what can be done to help her and other @entity4 refugees who are seeking the higher standards and lower waiting times which are being delivered by this government ? ’ amid raucous scenes in the @entity40 , @entity100 accused @entity11 leader @entity103 of ‘ laughing ’ at the failings of the @entity4			0
‘ frankly what is happening to our @entity4 in @entity1 is a scandal and it is a scandal that is entirely the responsibility of the @entity116 who are running the @entity119 government , ’ he said			1
‘ they made the decision to cut @entity4 spending by 8 per cent in @entity1			1
as a result they have not met an @entity125 target since 2009			0
i do n’t know why mr @entity103 is laughing - it ’s not funny , the state of the @entity4 in @entity1			2
‘ if he had any gumption , if he had any backbone , he would get hold of the first minister in @entity1 and he would tell him to start investing in the @entity4 in @entity1			2
’ the @entity4 is worse than that in @entity5 because , unlike the coalition which protected health spending in @entity5 , the devolved @entity11 - run government decided to cut it			2
during prime minister 's questions , @entity100 said : ' what is happening to our nhs in @entity1 is a scandal and it is a scandal that is entirely the responsibility of the @entity116 who are running the @entity119 government ' in addition , @entity11 health ministers rejected @entity145 ’s target regime and the introduction of private sector provision , both of which are credited with bringing down waiting times			2
almost 50 per cent of @entity1 cancer patients must wait six weeks or more for vital scans and tests compared with a 1 per cent figure in @entity5			2
the exodus to @entity5 is also fuelled by a lack of access to the @entity158 , which funds treatments rejected by the @entity4 or awaiting approval			2
last night mr @entity41 said : ‘ @entity7 is one of a large number of patients contacting me , not satisfied with the standard of treatment on the @entity4 in @entity1 , and want the right to be treated by the @entity132 - run @entity4 in @entity5			1
‘ that ’s not a reflection on doctors and nurses in @entity1 , it ’s a reflection of the fact that @entity11 have failed to run the @entity11 properly , with longer waiting times , and less access to cancer drugs			0
people are desperate to leave and be treated in @entity5			0

@entity7 , 60 , needs biopsy before correct treatment can be given
she has been waiting since last october to be given appointment in @entity1
in desperation she has borrowed £ 3,000 to pay for private doctor in @entity19
she is now demanding for the right to be treated on the @entity4 in @entity5
