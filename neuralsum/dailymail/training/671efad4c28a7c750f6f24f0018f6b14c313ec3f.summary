by @entity0 published : 20:45 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 20:57 est , 26 february 2013 @entity2 theatres , including prestige names such as the @entity4 , have been warned to stop duping the public by failing to declare rip - off fees			1
people making online bookings to see @entity9 , which starred @entity10 and @entity11 , were hit with unexpected charges			0
most prime @entity2 theatre tickets are ruinously expensive , with some costing more than £ 100 each			0
on notice : @entity2 theatres , including prestige names such as the @entity4 ( pictured ) , have been warned to stop duping the public by failing to declare rip - off fees theatres and agencies do try to tempt people with promises of some cheap tickets , perhaps starting at just £ 10 for a seat miles from the action			1
however , a transaction fee , which typically ranges from £ 1.50 to £ 3 , is generally not added to the bill until the final online check - out			1
while some companies go further and impose a £ 4 per seat booking fee on top in a manoeuvre that renders the official ticket price meaningless			2
now the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) has put theatres and ticket agencies on notice that they should declare all compulsory charges at the beginning of the booking process			2
it is issuing a ruling today against the @entity4 , the giant @entity41 , which trades under @entity42 , the @entity43 , and the @entity44			1
rip - off fees : the @entity32 says theatres and ticket agencies should declare all compulsory charges at the beginning of the online booking process the @entity4 was promoting tickets for @entity51 ’s revival of @entity52 at prices of £ 16 to £ 70 without clearly declaring a booking fee of £ 1.50 for online purchases and £ 2.50 via telephone			1
@entity41 claims to be the @entity58 ’s biggest specialist theatre ticket agency , while it also produces shows as well as owning and managing several @entity2 theatres			0
the company is currently taking bookings for the new musical @entity64 , however consumers must pay a booking fee of £ 4 per ticket plus a one - off transaction fee of £ 3			1
consequently , someone buying four of the cheapest tickets for £ 27.50 each , which have a face value of £ 110 , would actually end up paying £ 19 extra			0
the @entity43 advertised 100 tickets for every performance of @entity75 at £ 10 , however it failed to clearly spell out there was an extra £ 3 transaction levy per booking			2
the @entity44 was also guilty of the same confusion by failing to declare a booking fee of £ 2			2
the advertising watchdog has no power to outlaw the fees , however it can name and shame companies which fail to declare them or mislead consumers			0
a spokesman said : ‘ the @entity32 is clamping down on hidden costs which are misleading and unfair			0
‘ today ’s rulings about advertised prices for theatre tickets make clear that sellers must be up - front about extra fees like admin charges right from the beginning			0
‘ our priority now is to make sure that this is followed by all ticket retailers , so there are no more hidden costs			0
’ all the theatres and companies censured by the @entity32 have agreed to change their websites to declare all compulsory fees at the beginning of the ticket purchase process .			1

the @entity4 and the @entity44 were issued a ruling
a transaction fee , ranging from £ 1.50 to £ 3 , is generally not added to the bill until the final online check - out
all theatres and companies censured by @entity32 have agreed to make changes
