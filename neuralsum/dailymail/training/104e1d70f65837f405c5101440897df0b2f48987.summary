while you may think badges and posters honouring celebrities are a reasonably recent idea , they were in fact being produced more than 200 years ago			0
in an age where men at sea rather than singers , actors and athletes were the stars of the day , there was still plenty of money to be made in merchandise			0
from pipes to badge - like discs , entrepreneurs began to produce memorabilia of one of the 18th and 19th century ’s biggest celebrities - @entity23 heroes			1

also recognised in a metal disc was @entity50 , who in 1739 captured @entity60 from the @entity61 - and was a precursor to @entity29 's celebrity status			1
a remarkable collection at the @entity65 in @entity66 , south - east @entity67 , is showing how sea - faring heroes became @entity70 celebrities			1
the exhibition looks at how the @entity23 shaped the course of @entity70 history in a period when it became a greater focus of public life than ever before			1
spectacular : the ' @entity78 ' at @entity79 showing the launch of the ' @entity81 ' by @entity82 , in 1757			0
this picture is a composite of two events , set at @entity79 , combining the launch of the ' @entity81 ' , on october 21 1755 with a view of the ' @entity78 ' , 100 guns , which was in reality launched a year later at @entity90			0

' the @entity23 rose to unprecedented popularity across the nation ' @entity110 , naval history curator ‘ the @entity23 rose to unprecedented popularity across the nation			2
when you 're talking about the @entity23 in this period , you 're talking about a national endeavour			2
‘ it 's not just the 140,000 who served in it in its height in the 1810s			0
there were also thousands working in the dockyard , farms , forests and mines			0
‘ we want to show how the @entity23 has shaped the lives of @entity70 people			2
in times of victory , the @entity23 was celebrated and people like @entity29 were heroes			1
below deck : the @entity141 , 21 october 1805 , by @entity142			0
the exhibition @entity29 , @entity23 , @entity143 explores the @entity23 ’s impact upon ordinary people while also providing a setting for the @entity65 ’s huge collections relating to admiral @entity29 remembering a hero : on the left , a plaster - life mask of @entity29 from circa 1800 , with his eyes open and hair parted in centre			1

on the right , is a prattware pipe from circa 1798 , modelled as a half length figure of @entity29			2
his right arm is missing , and he wears a uniform coat , waistcoat and ruffled shirt ‘ we can show how people across @entity70 brought the @entity23 into their homes , using ceramics to decorate their bedrooms and dining rooms			2
’ mr @entity110 added of the metal disc commemorating admiral vernon : ‘ @entity179 's victory ( at @entity60 ) basically turned him into a national celebrity			1
‘ it 's like a football poster on a wall			0
this is happening just a time in @entity70 where consumer goods like this are becoming cheaper			0
‘ you might have clipped it to your clothing , so it was a public way of displaying not only your affections for this leader , but also displaying your patriotism			0
’ astonishing : @entity194 of the @entity195 ; - destruction of @entity196 ; - or - the @entity70 hero cleansing ye mouth of ye @entity200 by @entity202 ; @entity203 , 1798			0
this celebrates @entity29 's resounding victory over the @entity207 fleet at the @entity208 in 1798			1

the biblical plagues of @entity213 of the title are transformed into crocodiles , which stand in turn for the @entity207 ships taken or destroyed shooting practice : a @entity219 pistol from circa 1790 is pictured left			0
and a cut paper picture commemorating vice-admiral @entity29 from circa 1806 is seen right			2
the inscription reads : ' this the @entity229 [ sic ] after all his @entity231 [ pair of hearts and doves ] / from @entity235 whilst living none could take the spoile , / , @entity230 is his prime and made the @entity223 [ heart and arrows ] / whom late all @entity143 did both love and dread / the ever to be lamented death of vice admiral lord viscount @entity29 ' also in the collection was a @entity29 pipe produced following the @entity208			1
mr @entity110 said : ‘ in 1798 , people had known about @entity29 before			2
' people across @entity70 brought the @entity23 into their homes , using ceramics to decorate their bedrooms and dining rooms ' @entity110 , naval history curator ‘ but the @entity208 was the first one he had commanded a fleet and won			2
this is what turned him into a national celebrity			0
‘ so you get an incredible range of weird and wonderful goods			0
the likeness is n't particularly accurate , but it 's the kind of thing that a middle - class person would love			0
’ one of the star attractions of the exhibition - called @entity29 , @entity23 , @entity143 and opening on @entity259 , october 21 2013 - is a painting by @entity28			1
the @entity26 of @entity29 , from the @entity27 on october 21 1805 , painted in 1825 , portrays the moment when @entity29 was fatally shot			1
artefacts : a full - length figurehead is pictured left , depicting a heraldic crowned lion , holding a small badge of the cross of @entity267 at the breast			0

@entity29 was famously killed in the battle , while his @entity207 counterpart , @entity296 , was captured along with the @entity207 flagship @entity297			0
mr @entity110 , 30 , said : ‘ @entity29 's tactics at @entity27 ensured there would be a decisive outcome - but a fierce fight			1
‘ this painting , which was probably painted about 20 years after the battle , shows @entity29 being hit by a @entity207 musket ball and falling to the deck			1
‘ @entity29 is subsequently carried below deck where he slowly dies			0
this painting also gives a wonderful insight into the frenetic aspect of fighting at sea			0
