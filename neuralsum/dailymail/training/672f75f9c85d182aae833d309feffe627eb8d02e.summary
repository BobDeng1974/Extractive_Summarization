' disgrace ' : @entity0 , who appeared to oppose the extradition of @entity2 , has been criticised for his lack of attendance at @entity6 meetings a @entity8 councillor who opposed the extradition of hate cleric @entity2 has been branded ' disgraceful ' after it emerged he pocketed nearly £ 7,000 of taxpayers ' money despite only attending one half hour council meeting this year			1
@entity0 , 20 , has so far earned £ 6,667 this year from @entity6 , but has only made the one appearance at the mayor - making ceremony in may			1
and fellow councillors were left fuming when he publicly threw his support behind the bid to halt the extradition of hate cleric @entity2 to the @entity20			1
current rules mean mr @entity0 must only attend one other full council meeting between now and next may to avoid triggering an automatic by - election			1
frustrated fellow councillor @entity24 slammed mr @entity0 , claiming he has not been representing the people of his ward in @entity27 , @entity28			1
she accused him of neglecting the concerns of residents in favour of his £ 20,000 role as black students officer at the @entity34			0
she raged : ' @entity36 ’s attendance record is a disgrace and shows utter contempt for the people of @entity27 who elected him to be their voice in the council chamber			0
' @entity36 is n’t trusted to be on any committees this year after he missed half his meetings last year			0
' he only has to turn up to one meeting per month , but so far he ’s missed all but one of them this year			2
this month , he was at a student union committee meeting instead			0
defeat : @entity48 - born @entity2 was extradited to the @entity20 last week and has appeared in court already ' @entity27 residents elected him hoping he would bring youthful energy and enthusiasm to the role - instead , he ’s missing in action			1
' to cover the costs of fulfilling their public duties , all 49 @entity6 councillors are paid a basic attendance allowance each year , of £ 8,000.83			2
frustration came to a head this week when mr @entity0 appeared to criticise the deportation of hate cleric @entity2 by tweeting : ' @entity63 government deporting @entity63 citizens to the bastion of human rights that is the @entity20 # shame ' it is not the first time he has caused controversy through his official @entity71 account @ aaron - kiely			1
in august last year 2011 he was forced to release a grovelling apology after comments he made defending @entity76 rioters and describing the @entity77 ' institutionally racist '			0
support : mr @entity0 appeared to oppose the extradition of hate cleric @entity2 when he posted this tweet mrs @entity24 continued : ' he manages to find time to condemn the decision to deport @entity2 and accuse the police of " brutal tactics " , but not stand up for the people of @entity27 - he ’s an utter disgrace			1
' when @entity36 was elected he promised that he would be there for local people , but this promise has been cynically broken			0
' this makes me angry ; when you make someone a promise , it should be kept			0
' mr @entity0 was voted in as one of three councillors for the @entity27 ward in may last year 2011			1
since the beginning of this year 2012 he has failed to attend meetings in january , february , march , june , july and september			0
@entity102 encounter : mr @entity0 has only attended one meeting this year as councillor for @entity27 at @entity6 meetings in april were suspended due to the local elections while there was not a full council meeting in august due to the summer break			1
he has earned almost £ 3,000 since he last turned up at full council in may			2
embarrassingly , if mr @entity0 had been on @entity6 ’s youth cabinet - whose members are unpaid - he would have already been given the boot as members are not allowed to miss more than three consecutive meetings without good reason			1
the @entity8 leader of the @entity6 , @entity116 , has now launched an investigation , warning that the young representative faces suspension			2
last night he said : ' we have been supportive of @entity0 , but he has fallen short of the standards that we believe should be met			2
' consequently the @entity8 group now has no option but to take appropriate action against @entity36 and will be investigating issues , including some of the views that he has chosen to put in the public domain			0
' we will look at the appropriateness of those comments and of his contribution to the @entity8 group , his ward residents and the council			0
' it is likely that we will seek his suspension from the @entity8 group while that investigation is undertaken by the appropriate people			0
what the outcome will be beyond that would be unfair to speculate on at this time			0
' despite repeated attempts to contact him for a response , mr @entity0 was unavailable for comment today .			2

@entity0 , 20 , has earned £ 6,667 so far this year but has only attended one @entity6 meeting
mr @entity0 last week tweeted in *opposition* of extraditing cleric @entity2 to the @entity20
