in the squalid @entity3 dogfighting kennel , a champion named @entity1 sat in a makeshift wooden cage , his teeth exposed from a missing snout			2
nearby , an undercover agent with the sheriff 's office met with @entity1 's breeder , a big - timer in the underground world of dogfighting named @entity13 , and made a deal that was caught on a hidden video camera			2
@entity13 - whose puppies other breeders nationwide sought for their prized bloodlines - was charged with 17 felony counts associated with dogfighting after that 2012 sting , and faced possible prison time			1
a dog seized during the second - largest dog fighting bust in @entity25 history sits in a pen at a kennel in @entity3 , @entity28 it seemed like a sure win for investigators , who have gone after dogfighting with greater interest ever since @entity34 star @entity33 pleaded guilty in 2007 to bankrolling a dogfighting ring and other charges , eventually serving 18 months in prison			1
the three largest dogfighting busts in @entity25 history have occurred since 2009			1
but despite being banned in all 50 states and the momentum generated by the @entity33 case , the ancient blood sport is thriving in the underground , with hundreds of thousands of dollars at stake on big matches , police detectives and prosecutors said			1
state laws still require no minimum mandatory jail time , so while arrests and convictions can be disruptive to dogfighting rings for a short while , the practice continues to flourish			1
" unfortunately , in our courts today , animal welfare is not given the attention and seriousness that it deserves , " said @entity55 , the @entity3 - based animal cruelty prosecutor who tried @entity13 's case			0
" we constantly fight for more court time , resources and attention			2
" in 2013 , after a three - year investigation that included local police and the @entity68 , more than 15 people were arrested , 367 dogs seized , $ 500,000 in cash , firearms and drugs were seized in @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76			0
it was the second - largest dogfighting bust @entity25 history , known as the ' 367 case			1
' a few big federal busts like the 367 case that have occurred since @entity33 are rooting out some large fighting groups , the more investigators look for organized , professional level dogfighting , the more they 're finding			1
@entity34 star @entity33 pleaded guilty in 2007 to bankrolling a dogfighting ring and other charges , eventually serving 18 months in prison ' this is a much bigger problem than people realize			1
law enforcement is learning that there 's an absurd amount of money involved , ' said officer @entity95 , a dogfighting investigator with the @entity96			2
@entity95 , who worked with the @entity68 in april on a dogfighting bust that netted 12 suspects in @entity99 , said investigations focused on a criminal group 's dogfighting business can be more useful to detectives than following drug money			2
' the criminal organization ( in @entity99 ) was making more money from the dogfighting part of gang activities than from the drug trafficking part , ' @entity95 said			0
authorities say dogfighting is n't a regional phenomenon : arrest data collected by @entity114 of the @entity25 since 2011 show hundreds of busts ranging from @entity117 to @entity118 , and in nearly every state			1
" people believe it 's happening in someone else 's community , " said @entity120 , of the @entity121 , who worked with law enforcement on the 367 bust			0
" there 's not one kind of neighborhood or type of individual ... we 've seen judges , a doctor , lawyers , nurses and firefighters all being involved in this			0
" still , when there are arrests , prosecutors are often hamstrung by outdated laws once a case gets to the courts			0
in @entity28 , where dogfighting arrests are routine , there is no minimum mandatory sentence for conviction			1
the state 's animal welfare law was written to protect livestock , so prison time is mandatory for the felony abuse of a horse or a cow , but not a dog			1
animal cruelty legal experts say the same is true in states throughout the nation , but note that there is progress in toughening laws			0
in @entity28 , where dogfighting arrests are routine , there is no minimum mandatory sentence for conviction for example , @entity118 's animal protection laws are more than a century old , and also focus on the treatment of livestock , said @entity173 district attorney @entity172			1
@entity174 , who heads the state 's district attorneys association , is advocating for a new law in @entity178 that would bring cruelty laws up to date and strengthen penalties			2
' prosecutors and the courts are hamstrung by laws that are n't just out of date but that do n't treat crimes against animals like the serious crimes that they are			0
not only does animal crime law in @entity118 have little to no sentencing requirements , but it does n't even allow the courts to count prior convictions in sentencing , essentially giving a free pass to repeat offenders , ' @entity174 said			0
laws are slowly changing in other states to make prosecuting these cases easier , said @entity198 , a staff attorney at the @entity199 in @entity200 , @entity201			0
seven states have added dogfighting to racketeering laws since @entity33 's case in 2007 , and in 2013 the federal government added a law to the @entity208 that made attending a dogfight illegal			1
@entity28 prosecutor @entity55 wants increased penalties for animal fighting to help bring more successful cases , but says either way , the cases will always be difficult			0
even though @entity13 , the dog breeder who faced 17 counts , and was well - known by advocates and dogfighters alike , he received no time behind bars			0
his case was delayed for two years until august , when a judge taking into account @entity13 's advanced age - he 's now in his 70s - and lack of a significant prior record sentenced him to probation and set him free			0
' our victims do n't have a voice and can not testify as to what happened , ' @entity55 said .			0
