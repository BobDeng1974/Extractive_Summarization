saturday is the day when love of math and a hankering for pastry come full circle			1
the date is 3 - 14 - 15 , the first five digits of the mathematical constant pi : 3.141592653			1
the best times to celebrate are at 9:26 and 53 seconds , morning and evening , and the occurence wo n't happen again until march 2115			1
on saturday the date is 3 - 14 - 15 , the first five digits of the mathematical constant pi : 3.141592653			1
@entity11 is celebrated on march 14th ( 3/14 ) around the world			2
@entity13 ( @entity16 letter “ π ” ) is the symbol used in mathematics to represent a constant — the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter — which is approximately 3.14159			2
' it 's a portal into this magical mysterious world of mathematics , ' said @entity27 mathematician and author @entity26			0
' @entity13 is the constant used to calculate the area of a circle , as in pi times the radius squared , but it appears all over other parts of mathematics			1
it ' is kind of a basic atomic building block ' for math , said @entity38 mathematician and author @entity37 , who was interviewed at precisely 3:14:15 p.m. in some places , @entity11 is celebrated with the edible type of pie			0
' it 's a real exciting moment for math enthusiasm , ' said @entity45 , a @entity46 math professor , who called it a time for people to ' remember how much fun they found some of the stuff in school			0
' @entity53 acknowledged that most people do n't really recall math as fun , blaming that on how it 's taught : ' there 's fun stuff out there in the quantitative world			0
' one interesting aspect of pi is that it is irrational , which means the decimals after 3 go on to infinity with no repeating patterns			1
yet in 1897 , a bill before the @entity70 legislature tried to round it up to 3.2			0
' we can not change it			0
it 's not subject to opinion or taste or time , ' @entity26 said			0
' how many things like this in the universe mean the same thing to everyone through time and space ? ' this pi story goes full circle , with exactly 314 words			1
in honor of mathematical constant 's designated day , @entity88 will be announcing its ' @entity92 ' admissions on march 14 , 2015 at 9:26 a.m. et. celebrating @entity11 is n't new for the prestigious college , but this year is extra special , as the date aligns perfectly with @entity13 's first eight numbers : 3.1415926			1
@entity13 has been calculated to over one trillion digits beyond its decimal point			2
as an irrational and transcendental number , it will continue infinitely without repetition or pattern			0
while only a handful of digits are needed for typical calculations , @entity13 ’s infinite nature makes it a fun challenge to memorize , and to computationally calculate more and more digits .			2

saturday is 3 - 14 - 15 , the first five digits of pi
the best times to celebrate are at 9:26 and 53 seconds
@entity88 using these times to tell *candidates* if they have a place
*dozens* of *bakeries* preparing special pies for the day
