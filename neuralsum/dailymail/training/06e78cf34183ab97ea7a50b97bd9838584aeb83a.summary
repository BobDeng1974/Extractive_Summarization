by sir @entity0 @entity1 : 19:30 est , 31 december 2013 updated : 04:33 est , 1 january 2014 as we reach 2014 , we come to a fork in the road			2
in one direction runs a path to a greener , fairer and happier society , nourished by urban regeneration , energy efficiency , and proper protection of the environment			1
in the other direction runs a stony track surrounded by blighted landscapes , where inner cities and derelict sites are left to rot			2
warning : sir @entity0 warns the emerging political consensus , with its ' gung - ho emphasis on growth ' , promises a future of urban sprawl and exploitation of the natural world are we really prepared to head down that dismal route ? to risk so much of what is precious to us and worth celebrating in our environment ? to allow our appetite for economic success to create such pollution , such waste , such damage ? unhappily , it seems that we ordinary people may have no say in the matter			1
the emerging political consensus , with its gung - ho emphasis on growth , promises a future of urban sprawl and exploitation of the natural world , whichever leaders we elect			1
awareness : the former poet laureate says politicans need to recognise the rising public anger about the loss of our green spaces unless , that is , our politicians think again and recognise the rising public anger about the loss of our green spaces			1
@entity54 has warned repeatedly about the @entity56 ’s planning policies , arguing that they have made @entity58 ’s countryside – our priceless national inheritance – more vulnerable than ever			1
but the situation is even more worrying now the @entity61 has jumped on the same bandwagon : for their ‘ right to grow ’ , read ‘ right to sprawl ’			1
the solution to our urgent housing needs is not to smear housing estates across open countryside , even if they are dolled up as ‘ eco-towns ’ or ‘ garden cities ’			2
especially since they probably wo n’t be affordable to those most in need of a home			2
only by concentrating a building programme on @entity58 ’s 1.5 million brownfield sites can we meet our triple need : to save the countryside , revitalise our cities , and provide the necessary increase in new homes			0
economic growth continues to be the politicians ’ mantra , and fair enough			1
but we need green growth that respects the environment and our primal connection with the land			1
we ca n’t just go for growth and ignore the reality of climate change , attempting what a treasury minister has called ‘ the biggest programme of infrastructure development since the @entity96 ’			0
the @entity96 did n’t have to think about their carbon footprints			0
and yet all our politicians ’ stories about the growth of infrastructure depend on us consuming more fossil fuels , on building more roads and runways			1
even farming is implicated in this , with wind and solar farms industrialising the countryside they set out to preserve			0
so often , this industrialisation simply is n’t necessary			0
the energy minister himself has pointed out that we can meet solar energy targets by installing panels on just 16 per cent of @entity117 commercial and industrial roof - space			1
and we can dramatically reduce the amount of energy infrastructure we need – and improve our energy security – by focusing on energy efficiency			0
driven by a dismaying short - termism , our leaders want to embark on a second industrial revolution in order to compete in ‘ the global race ’			2
but the difference in scale alone means we can never compete with the largest economies in the world			0
so let ’s stop pretending we can , and instead make the most of our own particular , distinctive attributes and advantages			0
maintaining our irreplaceable countryside must lie at the heart of that ambition			0
not just for the sense of benefit and wellbeing that is essential to our humanity , but for good practical reasons as well : for the huge contribution that rural tourism and farming make to the exchequer .			0
