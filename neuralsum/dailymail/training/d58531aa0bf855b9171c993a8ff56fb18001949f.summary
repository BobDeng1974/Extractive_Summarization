famous tenant : @entity1 lived in the central @entity3 flat the traditional hunting - scene print on the sitting - room wall barely merits a second glance			1
and that , presumably , must have suited its owner just fine			2
for the unobtrusive picture ’s true purpose was to conceal a ‘ two - way mirror ’ affording the voyeur a generous view of a bed that played a starring role in the @entity16 , the scandal that defined an era			1
published for the first time , these pictures show where this mirror was installed in society osteopath @entity25 ’s @entity3 mews house			1
what happened in this impersonally furnished bedroom was central to one of the @entity30 ’s most celebrated courtroom dramas			2
the jury in the infamous 1963 trial were asked to decide whether @entity25 lived off the earnings of girls he pimped out to his rich and powerful friends			1
although the jury never saw these pictures , they were made aware that the two - way mirror existed			2
the question was : who was watching ? even @entity1 , the model at the centre of the scandal , remains engrossed by the mystery , saying recently : ‘ who knew who might be looking in ? ’ the photographs of the two - way mirror are among a number taken by police in 1963 of @entity25 ’s house			1
they have been suppressed by successive governments in a confidential file held in the @entity56 for more than 50 years			1
had it not been for repeated representations over the past three months by @entity60 , they would have stayed under lock and key until 2046			2
taken by a @entity65 officer on june 27 , a month before @entity25 ’s trial , they were found by this newspaper among letters and statements included in a file labelled : ‘ @entity71 ’			1
the images freeze the scandal in time			2
they show , outside the house in @entity76 – just behind @entity77 – two @entity79 relics : a @entity80 convertible and a three - wheel @entity82 bubble car			2
they also show that if the police officers who searched @entity25 ’s home that day anticipated finding an exotically appointed bordello , they were to be mistaken			1
with few personal touches , the bedroom and sitting room had the transitory air of cheap lodgings			2
peephole : a picture on the sitting room wall of @entity25 's central @entity3 mews house covers a hole behind a two - way mirror in one shot , there is a black - and - white tv in the corner and on the coffee table letters lie next to an ashtray and a packet of @entity108 cigarettes			1
were it not for the two - way mirror			2
along with @entity25 , two of the scandal ’s key protagonists lived at the address at various times in the early 1960s			1
first , ms @entity1 , whose affair with secretary of state for war @entity119 forced his resignation and effectively toppled @entity123 ’s government , and later her showgirl friend @entity124			1
the architect ’s plans for the house also feature in @entity71			2
clearly marked are the words ‘ hole in the wall ’ and its precise measurements			2
with the picture taken down , a voyeur could see into the bedroom other documents , including statements made to @entity138 during his official inquiry into the scandal that are still deemed too explosive for release , remain under lock and key			2
after the judge ’s summing up at his trial , @entity25 slunk away to a friend ’s flat , wrote a suicide note and took an overdose of barbiturates			1
included in the file is a handwritten letter to the court written by a doctor at @entity154 , @entity155 , on july 31 , the day afterwards			2
‘ this man has been admitted to this hospital this morning			2
he will be unfit to attend court today			0
’ in fact , he died three days later , not knowing he had been found guilty of living off the immoral earnings of @entity1 and @entity161			1
these days few doubt that @entity25 was the victim of a miscarriage of justice , scapegoated by a self - righteous establishment			1
a campaign to overturn the verdict is currently being led by leading human - rights lawyer @entity168			0
at the same time , @entity169 , similarly convinced of @entity25 ’s innocence , has turned his story into a musical now showing in the @entity173			1
@entity169 said yesterday : ‘ it is extraordinary in this day and age that so much material is still being held back			0
‘ it is time that all the documentation related to the case was released			0
we are , after all , talking about 2014			0
we are not living in the same climate as 1963			0
’ to some , there has never been a better time to shed whatever new light may be available on the murky episode			0
there has always been the suspicion that @entity65 , dutifully following orders from on high , were ‘ out to get ’ @entity25			1
the file certainly suggests that they approached their task with gusto			0
included in the file is a copy of @entity25 ’s original charge sheet			1
it features two previously unaired allegations : that @entity25 facilitated abortions – then illegal – for a @entity197 and a @entity199 w. other side : the mirror on the wall of the @entity204 bedroom in the frame : the view of the bed at the centre of the @entity16 , the scandal that defined an era however the charges , for which there was no evidence , were dropped before the osteopath faced court			1
at his trial , @entity216 , 20 , a known prostitute , told the jury that @entity25 brought her to @entity220 to have sex with an unknown man			1
she also whipped him and ‘ received £ 1 for each stroke ’			0
miss @entity216 confirmed that she saw a hole - in - the - wall but did not recall that it was hidden by either a mirror or a picture			0
nevertheless , its existence was sordid enough in itself – particularly in 1963			0
and the inference was clear			0
@entity25 was on the other side of the wall , furtively looking on			1
a month before the photographs were taken , a journalist , @entity233 , made reference to the mirror in a magazine article			0
‘ the bedroom is one of the strangest i have seen , ’ he wrote			0
‘ some previous occupant had made a large square hole through the bedroom wall to the drawing room			0
' there is a one - way mirror from the drawing room looking in the bedroom			0
this elaborate peephole is hidden by a picture of @entity250 and @entity25 laughed when he saw me inspecting it			1
“ that was installed by an old eccentric who used to own this place , ” he said			0
“ i ’m going to have it filled in as soon as possible			0
” ’ an exterior view of @entity25 's mews house in a 1963 police photo it seems @entity25 may well have been telling the truth about the hole ’s provenance			1
the flat was refurbished some years earlier by his friend , @entity265 , the chairman of the @entity266			2
it was then sold to a company belonging to notorious slum landlord @entity269			0
and at some point afterwards , @entity270 , the sleazy former husband of @entity271 and a friend of @entity269 , moved in – and , according to @entity1 , brought the mirror with him			1
it had previously featured in the infamous sex parties @entity270 threw with @entity271 at their riverside mansion in @entity278 , @entity279			0
when the couple separated , @entity270 moved the mirror to @entity220			0
long before @entity25 took up residence , @entity269 also lived at @entity220 , first with @entity1 then @entity124			1
other accounts suggest he , not @entity270 , installed the mirror			0
in her autobiography , @entity285 , published in 2012 , @entity1 reveals that she was aware of the mirror ’s racy history before it was installed at @entity220			1
@entity1 wrote : ‘ it had pride of place up on the sitting - room wall			1
it was n’t until later that i found out the mirror had a crack in it – @entity271 [ @entity271 ] , apparently , had broken it and it did n’t work any more ’			0
scapegoat : dr @entity25 is escorted from court by police in 1963 @entity25 was also a friend of @entity269 and attended the @entity278 sex parties with him where , according to the biography con - necting @entity271 : the @entity304 of @entity271 , ‘ alcohol , erotic stimulants , willing starlets and exotic dancers contributed to a sexually charged atmosphere			1
' the music throbbed , the dancing bordered on foreplay and inhibitions were suspended			0
‘ as intimacy developed into arousal , each couple was led to a special room and allocated 15 minutes , unaware that the room was fitted with two - way mirrors and their performance was a source of entertainment for select guests			0
’ @entity270 died in 1959 from tertiary syphilis			0
like him , the mirror he brought to @entity325 is long gone			0
the house ’s current owner , @entity326 , 54 , said yesterday : ‘ when i moved in 12 years ago , the builders told me there had been a hole for the two - way mirror but i never knew whether to believe them			1
‘ at the time , there was 1970s - style wallpaper with no evidence that there was any hole there			0
it was just a flat surface			0
so i suppose it must have been filled in			0
’ what other secrets the scandal will yield in the future remains to be seen			2
@entity168 said yesterday that material was being held back for ‘ irrational and wholly irresponsible reasons ’ , adding : ‘ @entity25 was the scapegoat for the @entity16 and there continues to be a cover - up			1
