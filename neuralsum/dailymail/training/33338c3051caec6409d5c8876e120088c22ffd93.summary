by @entity0 thank heavens @entity2 found fame as an actress - she 'd have made her family 's life unbearable if she had n't			1
@entity2 , who plays @entity7 in @entity8 , says acting 's been her goal ever since she can remember			1
' i was every relative 's nightmare - i 'd perform plays for them , ' she says			1
@entity2 landed her dream role at the age of ten - six years after her ambition began ' at first it 's cute , but it would get to the point where @entity22 would say , " why do n't you go upstairs ? " she took me to a theatre show when i was about four , and i was in awe of everyone on stage			1
so then @entity22 sent me to an acting school and it went from there			2
' and now after eight years in @entity31 she 's involved in her biggest storyline to date , as the killer of tragic @entity35 is at large - and not even the @entity8 cast know who it is			1
but if @entity2 did somehow find out , keeping it a secret would n't be a problem			1
for even after learning she 'd won her role on the soap when she was only ten , she managed to keep the news from her school friends			1
' i was called out of class and my mum told me in front of the head , ' recalls @entity2 , of the moment she found out she was about to be a major child tv star			1
' it blew my mind			2
@entity8 is so big , and as a ten - year - old it was daunting , but i was so excited			1
but i could n't tell my friends for about three months ! i liked keeping the secret , though			2
i kept thinking , " i know something you do n't ! " ' @entity2 says that a highlight of being in @entity8 is working with @entity58 who plays her on - screen grandmother - @entity60 after being introduced in 2006 with on - screen dad @entity61 , mum @entity62 and older sister @entity63 , @entity2 , now 18 , has gone from strength to strength as @entity7			1
she 's been tipped as ' one to watch ' by the critics as her character has enjoyed the ups and downs of the soap roller coaster : @entity7 's been hit by @entity73 's car , watched her parents ' marriage unravel , discovered @entity77 's dead body , struggled with @entity63 's drinking and had an on - off relationship with @entity80			1
her hard work was recognised in 2012 when she won the @entity82 gong at the @entity83			2
and now she 's in the thick of the action as the hunt for @entity35 's killer continues			1
' anyone could be in the frame for her murder , ' says @entity7			0
' it could be me , but we 're all in the dark			0
that 's why there 's such a buzz			1
everyone wants to find out			0
the challenge of playing a killer would be great			0
but then , if it were me , i 'd probably have to leave			0
' although relishing her prominent role on the soap , @entity2 says she struggled with the attention that comes with being in @entity8			1
' it 's fine now i 'm used to it , but at first it was scary because i 'd be shopping and strangers would say stuff to me , ' she admits			2
and what 's next ? ' i love it here			2
i 've been very lucky , ' she says			0
' but they could say i 'm leaving at any time			0
my dream is to win an @entity114			0
you never know , i could be the first person to win one in @entity117 - @entity8 : the movie ! ' travel , @entity119 or @entity120 ? i 'd love to visit @entity121			1
there 's a party scene and some culture too			2
fancy restaurant or greasy spoon ? @entity127 spoon – i do n't have nice enough clothes to go to a fancy restaurant			0
i 'm in a tracksuit now ! drinks , cocktail or wine ? i love a cocktail			0
i do n't like the taste of alcohol , so the juice masks it			0
@entity138 , @entity139 or @entity140 ? gladiator is my favourite film			0
it has action , fight scenes , a love story – a bit of everything			0
music , dance or pop ? i listen to @entity151 because i like a bit of dance music , but my tastes are quite varied			0
gym or sofa ? sofa			0
i have a gym membership but it does n't get used very often !			0

18 - year - old @entity2 has been in @entity8 since the age of ten
eight years on and she says she is still relishing every second
here she *discusses* struggling *adjusting* to fame and @entity35 's death
