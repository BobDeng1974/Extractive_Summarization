by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 07:51 est , 28 february 2013 @entity3 : 09:01 est , 28 february 2013 ' leftover women ' are highly successful career women aged 26 to 34 who remain unmarried hysteria is growing in @entity7 about the number of unmarried ' leftover women ' - but the fault lies with the country 's insecure male population , according to a new investigation			1
far from spurning suitors , highly successful career women aged 26 to 34 badly want to be married , but find themselves constantly rejected by @entity7 men who are uncomfortable with their careers and achievements			1
the findings come from dr @entity19 , a sociologist based at the @entity20			1
one woman , a 29 - year - old fund accountant with a @entity23 master 's degree , described how a potential suitor , introduced to her by her parents , backed off because ' he said he felt that he had to spend a lot of effort to control me , so he chose someone else who was easier to control			2
' another interviewee , a financial services manager , 33 , said : ' i used to date a guy who was much olderâ € ¦ he preferred me not working			0
his idea was that i should quit work after we got married			0
' the results come just one week after the country 's communist government upset its young female population by ordering its feminist @entity43 to use the derogatory term ' leftover women ' in order to urge them into marriage			1
far from spurning suitors , these women badly want to be married , but find themselves constantly rejected by @entity7 men who are uncomfortable with their careers and achievements @entity7 's government and media are concerned over the phenomenon of the ' sheng nu ' - literally ' leftover women ' - who remain unmarried despite having a good education and high - flying jobs			1
in 2007 , the @entity7 @entity60 attributed their failure to find a husband to their ' overly high expectations for marriage partners ' , in an official explanation of what sheng nu means			1
but dr to 's investigation into the first - hand experiences of these women found that these women struggle to find a lasting relationship because of the constraints of the conservative , patriarchal society in which they live			1
specifically , the 50 women interviewed for the study - all educated to degree level and half with a masters - found that men either discriminated against them because of their achievements , or expected them to spend more time doing housework in order to make their lives together a success - often at the expense of their jobs			2
dr @entity19 says many high - flying @entity7 women wish to marry , but can not find a man who is comfortable with their successes and achievements dr to said : ' during @entity7 's early reform era , management - level women faced discriminatory treatment in the marriage market			1
dr to 's research found ' leftover women ' could be split into sub-categories : @entity102 : women who seek out even higher - achieving men who will not be intimidated by them , or actively conceal their own successes in an effort to make themselves seem more compatible			1
@entity110 : a fusion of ' satisfy ' and ' suffice ' , these women take the opposite approach , actively seeking out lower - status men who will not force them to quit work and take on domestic roles , because they themselves are not in breadwinner jobs			2
traditionalists : these are women who continually strive to find a typical marriage partner for their demographic and struggle psychologically with the pressure of social expectation innovators : women who respond by actively seeking out a non-married lifestyle			0
' four decades later , my research found that highly - educated women in today 's post-reform era still suffer from the same discrimination , as they are passed over for less - educated , less career - orientated women instead			0
' many of them want to pursue the traditional path of marriage and even end up seeking higher - status husbands in an effort to do so			0
' ironically , most are shunned by men because of their own accomplishments			0
these women can hardly be blamed for their " leftover " status , because they are the ones who are being rejected			2
' dr to , who is based at the @entity20 , carried out the research while a phd student at the @entity150			0
her study was conducted in @entity153 between 2008 and 2012 and involved @entity7 women from 14 different cities			0
for most @entity7 people , marriage is still a ' must '			0
this has led to a nationwide craze for matchmaking reality shows on tv , and matchmaking events in public parks in almost every @entity7 city , where parents advertise their daughters ' physical and economic attributes on billboards			0
dr to wanted to find out why the so - called ' leftovers ' had not got married , whether they wanted to do so , and how they were responding to the social stigma attached to being single in a culture which prizes marriage so highly			2
contrary to the assumption that sheng nu are somehow pioneers for a new , more liberated generation of @entity7 women , dr to found most remain keen to get married her four - year research project showed that despite official claims that these women snub men who fail to live up to their own standards , the reverse was often true			1
many had been rejected by men who felt more comfortable with less accomplished women			2
others had struggled in relationships with boyfriends who expected them to spend less time at work and focus more on domestic and family life			0
dr to also investigated how women tried to cope with these ' male superior norms '			0
contrary to the assumption that sheng nu are somehow pioneers for a new , more liberated generation of @entity7 women , she found that most remain keen to get married .			1
