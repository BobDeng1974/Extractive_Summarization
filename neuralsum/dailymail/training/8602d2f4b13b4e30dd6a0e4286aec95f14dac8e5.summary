@entity0 has revealed a text message from @entity2 made him see the errors of his ways and he is determined to learn from his mistakes as a result			1
the former @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 midfielder was sacked as @entity12 boss on september 1 after a poor start to the new season , following on from relegation to @entity16			1
@entity0 was appointed on a full - time basis in september 2013 after taking over as caretaker manager following the sacking of @entity20			1
and after several months to consider what went wrong , the 41 - year - old has admitted it took a message from his fellow countryman @entity2 to help him evaluate his management style			1
" there was one ( a message ) from @entity2 , " @entity0 told the @entity39			1
‘ welcome to the club			2
‘ you ’re not a real manager until you ’ve been sacked			2
' was he right ? yes			2
in the process of being sacked , when you are sacked , and immediately afterwards , you do n’t see it coming			2
@entity0 in happier times at @entity12 , but he could n't turn the club 's fortunes around the former @entity53 international represented his country 16 times , scoring once ‘ you are still so wrapped up in the intensity of getting the job right , of making the players better and getting results , and dealing with the finances that you do n’t have time to sit back from it			1
‘ in the time of reflection after being sacked , you can look back and assess how you could improve , what you can do better			1
the fact is when you ’re winning you do n’t analyse things , when you ’re losing you look at everything			2
’ another mistake @entity0 discussed is forgetting the perils of managing in the modern era , with news more accessible thanks to social media			1
@entity0 went to tell his players of his sacking , and was asked to remind them not to post anything on social media sites			1
the club would handle the announcement			2
‘ i told them i accepted full responsibility and in some ways i ’d let them down , ’ @entity0 added			1
‘ but i did say a few of them had to look themselves in the mirror and look where the club is now			0
‘ @entity91 had gone and they ’d had the chance to put that right			0
there were a few home truths but it needed to be said			0
i shook their hands , wished them all the best and walked out			0
‘ and as i walked out the door , i thought ‘ * * * * forgot about the social media thing			0
’ so i ’d walked four steps , literally four steps , turned round , went back in the dressing room , and almost every one of them was on his phone			1
‘ i just said ‘ ah come on lads ’ but it was too late			0
’ and yet he misses it			0
he ’s learned from it			0
he does n’t despair of the @entity111			0
he wants to help them and make them better players in his team			0
‘ there are elements of me i have to change , ’ @entity0 added ‘ i have to learn to turn a blind eye to stuff like that and manage it differently			1
but it ’s not easy			0
no badges prepares you for these things			0
