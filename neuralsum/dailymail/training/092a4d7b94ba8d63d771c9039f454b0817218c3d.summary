by @entity0 published : 05:40 est , 8 may 2013 updated : 08:26 est , 8 may 2013 it was built in a time of innocence , when children were allowed to be children and health and safety officials were nowhere to be seen			1
these incredible pictures which have been discovered by historians show what is believed to be the world ’s first playground swing			2
it was built 90 years ago and shows children swinging enormous heights off the ground , with no safety surface underneath should they fall			1
unique : this picture shows what is believed to be the world 's first playground swing at @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity25 in 1923 upside down : this picture alone would no doubt shock health and safety officials up and down the country innocent age : the swing has long ropes and no safety surface , which would certainly shock health and safety officials of today different : the modern day swings at @entity23 are much lower and have safety surfaces in case the children fall off the play equipment is believed to have been constructed in 1923 in @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity25 - the first park of its kind in the @entity42			1
daredevils : with adults watching on , these children are almost upside down on the swings it was designed by owner @entity48 , as part of his vision to inspire and encourage play as part of families ’ health and well - being			1
he initially made swings and slides for his park , then went on to manufacture and sell them around the world			0
the photographs have been released as the park , which combines some of the @entity42 ’s oldest theme park rides with the largest free playground in @entity65 , launches a worldwide appeal to trace the oldest remaining working models of @entity48 play equipment			1
@entity48 said at the time : ' we had a @entity71 treat in the park and put up primitive swings with large poles , tied together at the top with chains			0
' fortunately they were not cleared away with the other things the day after the treat and i ultimately found them so popular that instead of pulling them down i added more			0
' in his 1928 book , a plea for @entity85 and after @entity86 , he proclaimed : ' i have good reason to believe that the park i have formed has changed the lives for the better , to a greater or lesser extent of thousands of children			0
fun : this play equipment is believed to have been constructed in 1923 in @entity23			1
it was the first park of its kind in the @entity42 @entity98 : with children standing up and hanging off the edges , today 's local councils may be more than a little concerned with this playground			0
the height children could reach on the swings can be seen by the child in the background ' i have direct evidence from mothers how whining , pale - faced children , complaining of any food they get , have come back with healthy faces and rosy complexions , ready to eat the house out after a good play in the playground			1
' the photos , which were discovered as part of a project to archive the history of the park , show girls and boys sitting and even standing on the swings , with people watching from below			2
in some of the pictures the children are swinging so high it looks as though they are about to turn upside down			1
@entity130 : this picture shows @entity48 who built the first children 's swings in @entity24 healthy : the playground was designed by mr @entity48 as part of his vision to inspire and encourage play as part of families ' health and well - being new : this image shows the catalogue from 1926 showing the new playground swings another photo shows a different type of swing , made from a long plank of wood and capable of squeezing 12 children on			1
they are seen sitting astride the wooden plank with nothing to stop them slipping off as the swing is pushed into the air			0
' these days health and safety legislation would never allow swings like this , ' said @entity160 , chairman of the @entity161 and @entity48 's great grandson			2
' but in the 1920 ’s if you fell off and tore your trousers you would get a clip round the ear from your dad , not a six - figure pay out			0
' people have been making swings for hundreds of years but we believe these are rare photos of the first modern swings to be used in the traditional playground setting that we all know today			0
' @entity48 , who was born in 1847 in @entity174 , opened @entity23 after the @entity175 because he wanted to give something back to the town he loved			2
his park allowed children to play freely and for families to enjoy outdoor life together			2
the swings were so successful in his playground that he later sold them around the world and they are featured in his play equipment catalogue from january 1926			1
modern : today 's swings look somewhat tame compared to those built in the 1920s the plank swings , which cost £ 16 , are said to be suitable for children under the age of 14 , but it states ' we can not guarantee them hooligan proof			2
' it also adds : ' as there are sometimes a dozen people on at a time , it is built strongly and on good sound mechanical principles throughout			0
' in a description for a set of six swings the catalogue states : ' by having several sizes , natural selection is encouraged and the bigger boys and girls do not oust the children from the smaller swings and vice versa			0
' another swing set is fitted with long dangling trapeze rings and states it provides a ' fine , manly exercise , ' and is ' greatly appreciated by youths '			0
@entity160 added : ' we are very proud of @entity48 and the revolutionary way he changed leisure time forever			0
' he helped prompt a healthier lifestyle by providing a wonderful open space and unique play equipment for ordinary , working class people			1
' wicksteed play equipment literally went to the four corners of the earth and we are appealing for people to get in touch , either directly or through @entity232 and @entity233 to let us know about the @entity235 equipment they have enjoyed and send us pictures			1
