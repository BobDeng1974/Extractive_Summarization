by @entity0 people who admitted eating large amounts of chocolate had , on average , far lower levels of fat over their bodies it seems like news that really is too good to be true			1
rather than being a major factor in piling on the pounds , eating large amounts of chocolate is one of the best ways to lose weight , a study has found			1
@entity17 researchers examined the diets and healthy activities of 1,500 teenagers aged between 12 and 17 in nine @entity22 countries , including @entity17 and the @entity23			1
they found that people who admitted eating large amounts of chocolate had , on average , far lower levels of fat over their bodies			1
in particular , they were trimmer around the stomach area - regardless of whether they had an active lifestyle or were on a diet			0
chocolate was also found to have a positive effect on circulation , blood pressure and heart health			1
the study , from the @entity39 , backs up earlier findings from the @entity41 that suggested regular chocolate eaters have less body fat			2
this may be because while chocolate contains more calories than many other foods , it appears to make the metabolism work harder , offsetting the fat that otherwise might hang around			1
there 's also the issue of denial			0
a recent poll found that 86 per cent of slimmers who carried on enjoying their favourite treats successfully lost weight			0
@entity59 , a nutrition scientist for @entity60 , which commissioned the survey , said : ‘ extensive research has proven that diets centred around food elimination are much more likely to fail			0
‘ the key is to take a more relaxed approach and to have a little of what you like			0
’ previous research has shown that dieters who completely eliminate treats such as chocolate , wine and biscuits are often more likely to put on weight as they ‘ compensate ’ by eating more of other foods			2
regular chocolate eaters were also were trimmer around the stomach area - regardless of whether they were active or on a diet one study even showed that as many as 65 per cent of those who give up all treats actually end up ballooning in weight			0
another recent study from the @entity86 found people who enjoyed chocolate every day were 29 per cent less likely to have a stroke and 37 per cent less likely to suffer with heart disease than those who avoided it most of the time			1
it is the flavonoids in cocoa beans - a key ingredient in chocolate - that seem responsible for the health benefits of chocolate			2
these flavonoids ( also found in tea and red wine ) act as antioxidants , which help mop up an excess of cell - damaging free radicals			0
as a rule , the higher the cocoa content , the more flavonoids and the greater the health benefits - dark chocolate with 40 per cent cocoa solids contains five times more flavonoids than white chocolate and twice as many as milk chocolate .			0
