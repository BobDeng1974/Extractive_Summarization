@entity1 fans are being asked to vote for the ending of his final novel , @entity5 , after he died in 1870 before finishing it it is a mystery which has long baffled and excited fans of @entity1 , and caused arguments in literary circles			1
some believe @entity1 ' @entity5 is dead , murdered by his uncle or love rival , while others think the engineering student has simply followed his dreams to go to @entity17			1
others suspect the character is merely lurking in @entity20 in disguise - after his fate was never revealed because @entity1 died while working on the manuscript for @entity5			1
now a group of academics hope to solve the 150 - year - old mystery of what actually happened to @entity5 by allowing readers to vote online for their preferred ending through a crowd - sourcing website			1
the project has been launched by dr @entity32 , an expert in @entity1 at the @entity33 who has written several books on the author			1
' there is a fascination with this book and people have been turning to it for almost 150 years to work out an ending , ' said dr @entity32			1
' people want to have an ending that they feel is worthy of @entity1 , that 's surprising and phenomenal			1
' @entity1 was working on the manuscript of @entity5 when he died of a stroke in 1870			1
his fans had been kept on tenterhooks by the story because he published it in instalments and was about halfway through when he suddenly died			1
various adaptations guessing the intended ending have been made - including that @entity54 , an orphan , was murdered by his uncle @entity55 in the fictional town of @entity20 , based on @entity57			1
others have pointed the finger at @entity60 , a love rival for the young student 's fiancee			0
several films and even a @entity66 musical have all dealt with the mysterious ending but dr @entity32 hopes that now it could be solved by people voting for what they think happened to @entity54			1
the @entity33 created a digital library of @entity1 ' weekly magazines and dr @entity32 used this to create a separate website speculating on the untimely ending of @entity5			1
around 100,000 people have already visited the site and about 1,000 have posted their views on the ending			0
dr @entity32 added : ' this book has been unfinished for almost 150 years now			1
and the response to it has been phenomenal			0
' people have been drawn into the intricacies and trying to draw out the story			0
' but because of this attention , it has moved more people away from the book because they start to believe it 's for the absolute experts and theorists			0
i want to find a way to open this up again and give the public the chance to express their opinion on the ending			2
' he said visitors to the website are invited to read the case notes and give their verdict on the mystery			2
dr @entity32 said the lack of ending was in fact a ' perfect finale ' to a @entity1 novel as it allows readers to remain engaged with him			1
an engraving of opium smoking called ' the @entity115 in @entity5 ' by @entity116 in 1872 has added to the mystery over what happened to engineering student @entity5 when he disappeared he added : ' it fascinates me why we keep turning to this book and asking these questions			1
it 's not that unusual for an author to die halfway through a manuscript but this has captured people 's attention			0
' it 's the most perfect final book for @entity1 because it 's not finished and allows the dialogue between reader and writer which he loved to continue			2
' dr @entity32 said that because of the popularity of @entity1 many people feel pressure to come up with intricate story lines , including many involving characters who are not central to the plot of @entity54 's disappearance			1
he cites one theory of a man who believed all of the characters were based on @entity146			0
this was based on the belief that a character named @entity150 was in fact @entity152 and father to all the characters , making them all related			0
' my own theory is rather boring , ' added dr @entity32			1
the last handwritten page of the @entity5 manuscript has led to years of speculation about the ending ' i do n't believe there is any reason not to believe friends of @entity1 and his biographer that @entity166 dies at the hands of @entity169			1
people will always want something a bit extra , that 's surprising and phenomenal , because it is @entity1			1
' they have all sorts of ideas , and normally not for the main characters			0
' the site includes profiles of the main characters and suspects in the mystery who include @entity54 's uncle @entity55			1
he is described as : ' a caring guardian to his orphaned nephew @entity166 ; if anything “ mr @entity55 ’s heart may be too much set upon his nephew ” , and it has been observed that @entity169 maintained “ a look of hungry , exacting , watchful , and yet devoted affection ” upon young @entity166 at all times			0
' @entity193 , a fellow orphan and the fiance of @entity54 , is described as having her ' seemingly blissful life darkened ' by the disappearance of her companion			0
people visiting the website called the @entity200 are asked to vote anonymously on various aspects of the ending such as whether he is dead or alive , where his body is and who killed or attempted to kill the student			2
there are several theories about what happened to @entity5 and disagreement whether the character was intended to die or merely went into hiding			2
in the 19th century the prevailing view was that @entity54 was in hiding after an attempt on his life , made by his uncle @entity55			2
others believe the young student was murdered by @entity55 because his uncle had confessed to him about his opium habit			0
@entity55 was also believed to be in love with @entity54 's fiance @entity193			0
one theory is that @entity60 may have murdered @entity54 because he was a rival for the affections of @entity193			2
he then is believed to return in disguise as detective @entity226			0
the sudden death of @entity1 in 1870 led to an almost immediate reaction by @entity230 theorists who started coming up with possible endings to the story			2
@entity233 played @entity5 in the @entity235 drama @entity236 , a @entity237 journalist , wrote an ending to the book after travelling to @entity57			1
in his version @entity54 survived an attempt on his life by @entity55			0
detective @entity226 then appears as mr @entity243 , a clerk and playwright , in disguise			0
in the 1800s there were rumours that the book itself had been written by @entity1			2
in 1873 @entity250 , a printer from @entity252 , published a version which he claimed had been ' ghost - written ' by him channelling @entity1 's spirit			2
some believe @entity54 returned in disguise - possibly in the form of detective @entity226 who appeared six months after his disappearance			0
the audience were given the chance to choose their own ending from an array of seven suspects during a @entity66 adaptation of the book in the 1980s			2
in the 1990s one theory was that each character represented an @entity270 @entity269 and all were related			0
in 2012 @entity272 attempted its own ending of the tale with a two part series			0
at the moment the votes cast are strongly in favour that the young @entity5 is in fact dead , murdered by @entity55			0
most believe his body is hidden in the @entity281 , but some think he could have been concealed in quick lime			0
opinion is far more divided on the fate and identity of the other characters			0
@entity55 and @entity60 are tipped to be other casualties in the story but readers appear to be unsure whether @entity226 is in fact a detective , @entity292 or an actor			0
results of the vote will be published in april to coincide with an exhibition about @entity5 organised by the @entity33			1
@entity297 , biographer to @entity1 , had previously claimed that @entity1 told him the story was to be one of a young man murdered by his uncle , who is eventually sent to prison for the killing			2
however doubt was poured on his theories after critics found he had muddled up some of the details			0
dr @entity32 's idea builds on that of the 1985 @entity66 musical , which paused half way through to allow the audience to decide between eight potential detectives , seven possible murder suspects and six would - be lovers to give the story their own happy ending .			1

@entity1 died in 1870 before finishing @entity5
