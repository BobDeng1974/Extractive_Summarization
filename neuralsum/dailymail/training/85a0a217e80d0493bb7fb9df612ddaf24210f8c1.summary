smoking in a car carrying children will become a criminal offence after @entity3 last night backed a ban in the @entity5 by a large majority			1
in an historic vote , @entity7 and @entity3 backed plans to make it illegal to light up in a car in @entity12 , punishable by a £ 60 fine or points on a motorist ’s licence			1
it came after prime minister @entity17 the ’ time has come ’ for a ban , brushing aside claims from his @entity22 deputy @entity21 who branded the ban illiberal and unenforceable			1
@entity3 have overwhelmingly backed a bill which will make smoking in cars containing children illegal by next year the new law will apply to anyone carrying children in a car , not just parents			1
mps voted by 376 votes to 107 , majority 269 , in favour of an amendment to the @entity39 which gives the health secretary power to impose a ban			1
it is expected to come into effect before the election , most likely in april next year			0
the move was first introduced in the @entity47 by the @entity48 , and coalition parties were given a free vote which means they can vote with their conscience and not the party line			1
during 90 minutes of debate in the @entity5 supporters of the legislation insisted it was vital to protect children from the dangers of second hand smoke			1
@entity7 health minister @entity61 said the success of the new law would be measured not by the number of fines issues but ’ by the reduction in exposure to second - hand smoke ’			1
@entity48 's shadow health minister @entity68 mp @entity68 proposed the ban , arguing that laws governing seat belts and smoking in public places were criticised as unenforceable but had been very effective			1
she said last night : ‘ this is a great victory for child health which will benefit hundreds of thousands of young people across our country			2
it is a matter of child protection , not adult choice			0
’ deputy prime minister @entity21 ( pictured visiting @entity82 in @entity83 this morning ) branded the law unenforceable and illiberal mr @entity21 said the police could not be expected to enforce a ban on smoking in cars , likening it to controlling what children eat or watch on tv but opponents said it was further evidence if the ’ nanny state ’ seeking to interfere in the private lives of drivers			1
@entity7 mp @entity97 condemned the ’ illiberal , nonsensical legislation ’ adding : ’ i fundamentally believe we should not be making bad , unenforceable law			1
’ fellow conservative , @entity105 mp , @entity102 said the law was ’ yet another in a long line of triumphs for the nanny state ’			1
he accused @entity110 of representing the ’ smug , patronising excesses of @entity48 who think that the only reason they have come into @entity115 is to ban everybody else from all the things that they do n't happen to like themselves ’			1
just hours before tonight ’s vote mr @entity17 gave the ban is support			1
@entity22 chief secretary to the treasury said he would back the ban , putting him at odds with @entity21 @entity127 mayor @entity126 said the ' bossyboots brigade ' were right to want to ban smoking in cars carrying children three years ago the prime minister said he was ' not sure whether it is possible to legislate in that area ' and called for a ' change in attitudes '			1
earlier today @entity22 health minister @entity137 said he hoped the ban would be law before the 2015 general election but today @entity141 made clear that while mr @entity17 understands the ’ concerns ’ that some have expressed , he believes that ’ the time for this kind of approach has come ’			1
however , mr @entity17 is spending 24 hours touring flood - hit communities in the @entity148 so missed the vote			1
among @entity153 , health secretary @entity151 , transport secretary @entity152 and education secretary @entity150 were among senior ministers supporting a ban			2
@entity127 mayor @entity126 appealed to fellow @entity153 to accept that the ' bossyboots brigade ' he so often rails against were right in this case			0
’ these kids can not protest , and very often the smoker in the vehicle lacks the will to stub it out , ’ he wrote in the @entity162			0
’ this law would give that smoker that extra legal imperative to obey their conscience and do the right thing			0
' ahead of the vote senior @entity153 including @entity169 and @entity170 voiced doubts about it			0
among @entity22 , mr @entity21 - who is a smoker - said that ‘ as an old - fashioned liberal ’ he believed that ‘ laws and legislation are not always the solution ’			2
he said it was wrong to ‘ subcontract responsible parenting to the state ’ and likened it to the police going ‘ into people ’s homes and saying “ turn the televisions off ” ’			2
however , @entity22 chief secretary to the treasury @entity184 and @entity22 health minister @entity137 backed the ban			2
@entity170 , the cigar - smoking minister without portfolio , said police would not spend their time checking if people were lighting up in cars split : health secretary @entity151 said he would back the ban , but @entity22 business secretary @entity194 committed to voting against it health secretary @entity151 is to back a ban , after previously warning it was not the state 's tole to dictate what people do in private @entity21 , the cigarette - smoking deputy prime minister : ‘ a family speeding along the @entity208 and mum or dad are smoking , how on earth are you going to properly enforce that ? ’ @entity170 , the cigar - smoking minister without portfolio : ‘ i do n't think our traffic police are going to be concentrating enormous efforts on racing up and down the motorway peering into cars , trying to see whether there 's a child in			1
' communities secretary @entity169 : ‘ my initial intention is to vote against it			0
we should make things criminal if we feel that they are enforceable			0
’ public health minister @entity61 : ‘ we are not persuaded that legislation is the right way forward on that matter			0
’ ( november 2013 ) chief whip sir @entity225 : ‘ i see some difficulties in trying to enforce a ban on all smoking in cars			2
’ ( november 2011 , when @entity5 leader ) prime minister @entity17 : ‘ whatever people have done in the past , the facts show that they really should change their behaviour			2
i am not sure whether it is possible to legislate in that area - we need a change in attitudes			0
’ ( march 2011 ) @entity239 , chief executive of the @entity240 , said : ' nearly half a million children are exposed to second - hand smoke in cars every week , putting them at risk of illnesses ranging from colds and ear infections through to asthma attacks , cot death , and meningitis			2
' bans on smoking in cars carrying children are already successfully enforced in countries like @entity255 , @entity256 and @entity257			2
’ the toxic fumes deployed from smoking in a care are 11 times more concentrated than lighting up in an open space			1
an opinion poll in 2012 by @entity262 found that 80 per cent of all adults and 65 per cent of smokers backed a ban on smoking in cars with children under 18			1
a @entity269 survey found 300,000 children a year visited gps in @entity12 every year with problems linked to second - hand smoke			2
passive smoking is linked to respiratory infections such as pneumonia and chest infections in youngsters			1

last week @entity170 , the cigar - smoking minister without portfolio , dismissed the plans as ‘ gesture politics ’			0
he added : ‘ we do keep creating new traffic offences			0
i do n't think our traffic police are going to be concentrating enormous efforts on racing up and down the motorway peering into cars , trying to see whether there 's a child in			0
‘ we do create too many traffic offences , i really do think it 's gesture politics			0
we 'll probably find two or three people fined a year			0
it makes the lobbyists feel better			0
’ every year 160,000 children are adversely affected by second - hand smoking , costing the @entity304 in @entity12 more than £ 23 million , the @entity301 ( @entity301 ) said			2
@entity305 , chair of the @entity301 's tobacco advisory group , said : ‘ the evidence shows the importance of protecting children from passive smoking , and cars are still a major area of exposure			1
‘ such exposure is widely associated with adverse health effects , including an increased risk of respiratory and allergic symptoms			0
’ but @entity319 , director of the smokers ' group @entity320 , said he was disappointed but not surprised ' by the decision and accused the government of being ' spineless			0
he added : ' legislation will have very little impact because so few adults still smoke in cars carrying children			2
those that do will carry on because it will be very difficult to enforce			0
' @entity323 has banned smoking in public places			0
now they 're going to ban it in a private place			0
