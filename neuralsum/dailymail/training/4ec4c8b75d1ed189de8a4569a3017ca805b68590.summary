by @entity0 published : 11:49 est , 22 november 2013 @entity2 : 11:51 est , 22 november 2013 it may sound like something from a sci - fi film but the next generation of @entity8 phones and tablets could be made from a super-strong substance called liquidmetal			1
@entity12 is a slow cooling alloy which means it can be moulded more easily than steel or aluminium , for example , and is more hard wearing			1
a series of new patents filed by the @entity20 - based firm explain how the company could use this alloy , along with 3d printing , to quickly manufacture the casing for new devices			2
a series of new patents filed by @entity8 detail how the company could use liquidmetal alloy , known as @entity31 , along with 3d printing , to manufacture the casing for new devices , pictured			1
layers of @entity31 could be printed to also create parts needed for phones , tablets and even tvs @entity12 is a mix of titanium , nickel , copper and zirconium among other metals making it tough , light and scratch resistant			1
it also feels as smooth as glass			0
it is a slow cooling alloy which means it can be moulded more easily than steel or aluminium , and is more hard wearing			1
the patents detail a process that involves injection moulding and 3d printing using bulk metallic glasses ( @entity31 ) powder - another name for liquidmetal			1
layers of @entity31 could be printed using a 3d printer to create the casing for phones , tablets and even @entity38			1
it could also be used to produce the more complex and smaller parts needed for inside phones , too , as well as make the devices super-slim			1

rumours about @entity8 using liquidmetal have been around for years after the company signed an exclusive deal with specialists @entity12 in 2010			2
the new patents have fuelled these claims further and follow rumours that @entity8 is also looking into using sapphire crystal in future versions of its displays			2
these rumours were similarly started after @entity8 signed an exclusive deal , this time with sapphire mineral experts @entity88			0
both technologies produce super-strong products and @entity8 may might be attempting to move away from its reputation for making fragile devices			0
the new patents detail a process that involves injection moulding and 3d printing using bulk metallic glasses ( @entity31 ) powder - the technical name for liquidmetal			1
layers of @entity31 could be printed using a 3d printer to create the casing for phones , tablets and even @entity38			2
rumours about @entity107 originated back in 2010			0
these concept images show what a new super-slim liquidmetal handset might look like			0
they were designed for @entity8 fansite @entity112 traditional metals have what 's called a crystalline structure , pictured left			1
@entity12 , by comparison , has an amorphous structure , pictured right			0
the white spaces in the crystalline structure are weak spots , whereas amorphous materials form fewer gaps meaning they have fewer weak spots , making them stronger overall these layers could then be moulded into shape using lasers and the process would be similar to how plastic is moulded for phone cases among other uses			0
@entity8 already uses liquidmetal for its sim - ejector tool which is used like a pin to pop the sim - card holder out from the side of the latest iphones			0
the patent , originally discovered by @entity8 , explains the process could be used for : â € ˜ a telephone , such as a cell phone , and a land - line phone , or any communication device , such as a smart phone , including , for example an @entity147 , and an electronic email sending / receiving device			0
it can be a part of a display , such as a digital display , a tv monitor , an electronic - book reader , an @entity156 , and a computer monitor.â € ™			0

@entity12 is a slow cooling substance that can be moulded easily
it 's stronger than *current* metals used to make phones and other *gadgets*
the technology is used in 3d printers known as a powder called @entity31
@entity8 could use this powder to make printing complex parts faster
this could *ultimately* lower production costs and lead to *cheaper* handsets
