the @entity20 , in @entity144 , shut down *unexpectedly* earlier this month
around 140 brides were left out of *pocket* and without a dress
they created a @entity32 page called ' where 's my dress ' so the women could connect and try to find *alternative* ways to get their dream dress
ladies and bridal companies started to *donate* dresses to the women
@entity0 was one of the women who have been left without a dress
she said the way the brides have been treated is ' disgraceful '
many brides have taken to *social* media to slam the bankrupt company
