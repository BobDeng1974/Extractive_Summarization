@entity0 , 51 , consulted her gp about an unusual freckle she found on her ankle as a redhead , 51 - year - old @entity0 was used to having freckles — they ’d covered her arms , face and chest since childhood			1
but in 2008 , she noticed a new freckle , darker than usual and larger — the size of a small fingernail — on her ankle			1
‘ i do n’t have many freckles on my legs , so i noticed it straight away , ’ says @entity0 , a mother of three and grandmother of five			1
‘ my gp told me it was nothing and not to worry about it			1
but , of course , i did			0
at the time , there was a campaign about the importance of early detection of skin cancer			1
every time i caught sight of the freckle , i would be reminded of how much i wanted to be around for my family			1
’ however , instead of returning to her gp to ask for a hospital appointment , @entity0 , from @entity31 , @entity32 , turned to her mobile phone for medical advice			1
‘ i ’d recently got an @entity35 and was downloading the apps that were just becoming available , ’ she says			0
‘ one evening , i searched online for “ large freckle ” and found my way to a free app that claimed to be a mole evaluator that would identify at - risk moles			1
i thought : “ why not ? what have i got to lose ? ” ’ @entity0 was ahead of the times			1
apps , short for applications — programs that can be downloaded to run on a smartphone — were few and far between in 2008			1
today , they ’ve become essential to most people ’s lives			0
with 100,000 health apps available in @entity55 and more launching every week , the medical sector is a market leader — with apps to track calories consumed and kilometres jogged , give first aid advice , provide cognitive behavioural therapy for phobias and remind people to take medication			2
one in five health apps claims to support a diagnosis , as with @entity0 ’s mole app. one program turns your mobile phone into an electrocardiogram , tracking heart rhythms and emailing the results to a doctor , while others allow patients to record blood pressure or blood sugar			1
in 2013 , the global market for health apps was worth $ 2.4 billion , according to market research firm research2guidance — and this is predicted to rise to $ 26 billion by 2017			2
the @entity83 has launched the @entity84 and @entity85 , and the use of apps in the health service is only set to increase			2
last week , it emerged that the @entity83 is now helping to launch apps to help people cope with depression			0
‘ we know people are more likely to make healthy choices if they can set their own goals , ’ says @entity94 dr @entity93 , professor of digital health at @entity96			2
‘ and there ’s evidence that with health apps , people are able to have a more grown - up relationship with their doctors and nurses			2
’ a handful of @entity109 have welcomed the technology to their practices			0
dr @entity112 , a gp in @entity114 , @entity115 , says three or four of the 40 or so patients he sees a day bring along their phones to provide information from an app. ‘ they might have diabetes or high blood pressure , and we ’ll use the app to look at an updated graph of their latest tests to see how well they ’re managing the condition			1
’ but critics say apps need regulation before we encourage doctors — and patients — to use them			0
there are no rules to regulate health apps			2
and @entity0 ’s experience shows why this needs urgent attention			1
@entity0 later downloaded a health app that said it would be able to identify at - risk moles ( file image ) the app @entity0 had downloaded consisted of several pages of photos of abnormal moles			1
‘ i remember scrolling through them with a growing feeling of panic , ’ she says			0
‘ but when there was nothing that looked remotely like my freckle , i thought i was off the hook			2
the app confirmed what the doctor had told me , and i stopped worrying			1
’ two years later , though , in summer 2010 , @entity0 scratched her ankle on her staircase and the freckle started to bleed			1
yet still she did n’t worry			2
‘ even when the scratch did n’t heal properly , i did n’t get alarmed			0
i thought it must be psoriasis , which i suffer from occasionally , ’ she says			0
a couple of months later , @entity0 ’s new gp caught sight of the messy spot , by then double the size , when she made a routine surgery visit			1
‘ he said , “ that ’s rather unsightly , why do n’t i remove it ? ” he made an appointment for me the same week , and later told me he knew straight away it was a skin cancer			1
’ tests showed @entity0 ’s ‘ freckle ’ was the most dangerous form of skin cancer — a malignant melanoma , which was at a stage where the cancer is liable to spread to the rest of the body			1
‘ i owe my life to that doctor and the fact that he noticed the spot while i was in his consulting room , ’ says @entity0			1
she was referred to hospital and , in january 2011 , had surgery to remove the tumour			0
‘ thankfully , there was no spread			0
the cancer had been caught , probably just in time			2
now , i have a slightly bumpy ankle and a 3 in scar			2
’ @entity0 says that there may have been a warning on the health app to check with a doctor — ‘ but i did n’t see it and , in the circumstances , i do n’t think i would have taken any notice ’			1
newer versions of mole - checking apps are more sophisticated , allowing users to photograph a mole and using mathematical formulas to check for skin cancer symptoms , such as asymmetry , irregular borders or varied colour			1
but they still miss two out of three melanomas , according to dermatologists at the @entity218 in a study published in 2013 in the journal @entity221			0
the researchers reported this can give users ‘ a false sense of security ’			0
‘ this is very dangerous when a lesion can grow deeper and spread to other organs within a matter of months , ’ says lead researcher and skin cancer specialist dr @entity229			1
and the fact that mole apps have been singled out in this way does not mean they are the only ones causing concern , says dr @entity239 , director of the @entity240 at @entity241			0
it was n't until two years later that @entity0 ( pictured ) discovered that the mole was in fact the most dangerous form of skin cancer ‘ reports of actual harm to consumers are still rare , but this could simply mean the potential for harm has n’t yet translated into an actual event , ’ she says			1
but attempts by regulators in the @entity256 to impose stricter controls have been unsuccessful			0
so while the manufacturers of @entity260 , an app that claims to be able to ‘ help to detect skin cancer earlier ’ ( and is downloadable in @entity55 ) has been fined by the @entity264 for making misleading claims in its advertising , the app is still doing business as normal			1
so , how can you know which apps you should use ? there are guides that can be helpful , says dr @entity112			0
he recommends the @entity275 ( apps.nhs.uk ) — though it is limited to less than 100 , with a basic rating system			0
he also recommends myhealthapps.net , an independent website that lists hundreds of apps , with a ‘ five heart ’ rating system based on reviews by patient groups , consumers and carers globally			0
@entity286 is to unveil a system of awarding kitemarks to trusted health apps later this year			2
but this will be a tricky enterprise , says @entity292 , chair of the @entity294 telemedicine and e-health section			0
proportion of @entity109 who use the internet to diagnose patients			0
‘ online commerce has found ways of approving apps very quickly as they come on the market , ’ he says			2
‘ health apps will have to be approved with the same urgency — in days or weeks , rather than months or years , as with new drugs			1
but there must n’t be any compromise to safety or efficacy			0
’ whether @entity55 doctors will welcome the e-health revolution — and their patients brandishing mobile phones in the consulting room — still remains to be seen			0
a recent survey of family doctors found eight in ten reported patients becoming more anxious as a result of using apps			2
dr @entity320 , @entity84 ’s gp , says apps ‘ will never be a substitute for an appointment with the doctor ’			2
‘ patients sometimes email me photographs , asking for an opinion , ’ he says			0
‘ it does n’t work			0
they have to come into the surgery and be examined properly			0
’ certainly , @entity0 has been put off health apps			1
‘ obviously , my first gp got it wrong when he told me not to worry about my freckle , ’ she says			1
‘ but on top of that , the app gave me a false sense of security			0
‘ thank goodness i now have a good doctor			0
thanks to him , all should be well at my five - year check - up next month			0
but it was a close call			0

in 2008 , @entity0 noticed a new , larger and darker freckle on her ankle
she consulted her gp but was told it was nothing to worry about
she downloaded a health app that also *suggested* nothing was wrong
two years later , @entity0 found out that the freckle was actually skin cancer
