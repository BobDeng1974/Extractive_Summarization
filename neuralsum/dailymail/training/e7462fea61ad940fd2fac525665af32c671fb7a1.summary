@entity0 blamed the referee for turning @entity3 ’s pre-season preparations into a ‘ circus ’ as the @entity5 lost 3 - 0 to @entity6			1
referee @entity7 , from @entity8 , gave two soft penalties to the home side – one for a handball by @entity12 and another for a @entity13 last - ditch tackle – and @entity0 was unimpressed , calling both decisions ‘ nonsense ’			1
the heavy loss on @entity19 soil ends this two - week leg of the @entity5 ’ @entity22 pre-season tour with their first defeat and they fly back to @entity26 on sunday night with @entity0 feeling disappointed with the way things have gone			1
‘ our expectations are not fulfilled because when we decided to have this match here in @entity48 we thought about an evolution in difficulty			0
‘ we were expecting a fast game a competitive game but we come here and the referee thought this was a circus for @entity6 fans – for them to have fun - and he killed the match			2
‘ this game for us would have been perfect			0
i like the @entity6 team - they are fast , intense and they defend with a lot of people			2
the opponent is perfect for is to compete today but we could n't play			0
’ the @entity64 coach felt @entity7 disrupted the game and made it a pointless exercise for his side			1
tough call ? @entity13 gave away a penalty against @entity6 after a last - ditch challenge tricky : striker @entity72 was largely ineffectual during the defeat away in @entity19 tucked away nicely : @entity74 strokes home @entity6 's second penalty of the afternoon late on run outs : @entity78 and @entity79 both got valuable match time under their belts @entity3 often found their attacks broken up by the referee ’s whistle and struggled to create chances despite the likes of @entity78 – who played 90 minutes - and @entity88 – a second half substitute – being on the field			1
‘ every foul , he gave a free kick against us to stop the game - and when we had advantage he stopped the game for a free kick which stopped us playing			2
‘ the penalties , especially the last one , were nonsense			0
‘ i am disappointed with that because we want to train and the referee did n't let us have a good session			0
' @entity0 later told @entity102 : ' the referee gave the penalty against @entity13 to finish his job in this beautiful party because it was a beautiful party for @entity6			1
' when the referee behaves this one did , this is not a friendly anymore			0

@entity7 handed the home side two penalties as they won 3 - 0
@entity12 was adjudged to have handled inside the box
*youngster* @entity13 gave a spot - kick away after a last - ditch tackle
@entity0 said he learned ' nothing ' from the friendly
