by @entity0 guilty : @entity1 stabbed his mother @entity2 to death at the @entity5 home they shared last september a cross-dressing killer stabbed his mother to death in a frenzied attack before dressing up in women 's clothes to try and fool neighbours into thinking she was still alive , a court has heard			1
@entity1 , 21 , inflicted more than 40 stab wounds on his mother @entity17 's upper body , when he turned the knife on her at their @entity5 home last september			1
the prosecution alleged @entity1 had planned to commit the ' perfect murder ' , by killing the 44 - year - old before impersonating her to allow himself precious time to dispose of her body			1
but a jury of seven men and five women found the @entity31 student not guilty of murder , but guilty of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility , due to mental health issues			1
the verdict came following a two - week trial at @entity39			0
judge @entity40 said : ' the evidence shows the defendant is capable of a very deliberate and calculated act of supreme violence			0
' if as a paranoid schizophrenic he is capable of this , he may present a very significant danger to anyone who upsets him for many years to come			0
' i am keen to see the extent to which paranoid schizophrenia will underscore the danger he poses to others in the future to assess a proper sentence			2
' judge @entity56 requested a full psychiatric report into the danger @entity1 could be to the public ahead of sentencing in june			2
the court heard @entity1 had written out a detailed plan including notes on how to walk in high heels and had receipts for pink @entity67 women ’s clothing			1
police found a bloodied pink hoodie and pink trousers , which @entity1 had bought from @entity67 a month earlier , as well as scraps of paper detailing an alleged murder plot			1
the jury heard how @entity1 , who was born in @entity75 but moved to @entity76 as a small boy , stabbed his mother to death on the morning of september 26 last year			1
receipts found at the house showed the murder weapon came from a knife block bought by @entity1 at @entity84 just a month before the brutal stabbing			1
victim : @entity1 inflicted more than 40 stab wounds on his 44 - year - old mother 's ( pictured ) body mrs @entity90 , who worked as an accountant for @entity92 , suffered more than 40 stab wounds to her head , face , neck , upper limbs and hands during the frenzied knife attack			1
she called boyfriend , @entity99 , on her phone during the attack at around 7.30am - although he only received the message when he awoke later that morning			2
@entity1 sat head in hands as the jury was played a disturbing three - minute voicemail in which the mother - of - two can be heard screaming ' do n’t stab me , do n’t stab me - you ’re a demon ' , before the message fell chillingly silent			1
mr @entity99 raced to the home shortly after 10am on the morning of the attack after hearing the message and let himself in using a spare key			2
he was confronted by the bloodied body of his lover lying on the kitchen floor and @entity1 , who said his mother had been attacked before fleeing the scene			2
@entity1 was later caught on @entity120 at around 10.30am calmly buying a can of coke and a pack of @entity125 cookies at a local post office before handing himself in to police			0
during police interview , he signed a confession stating : ' i admit killing my mother this morning by stabbing her			0
' i did this because she subjected me to a lifetime of physical and mental abuse			0
' she used the @entity136 to rationalise what she did to me			0
i believe she manipulated and brainwashed me			0
' i have been very depressed for a long time			0
i have tried to overcome it but i could n’t take it anymore			0
' @entity1 later changed his story saying a gang of masked men burst into his home , forced him to stab his mum then threatened him with further violence if he told police			2
he told the court a gang of five white , balaclava - clad men targeted him in a suspected racist attack			0
the university student went onto claim the mystery men had forced him to dress up in the ‘ ill - fitting ’ pink clothing and pink flip flops to move his mother ’s @entity157 car - a move the prosecution claimed had been an attempt fool neighbours into thinking his mother had driven to work			1
evidence from an expert psychiatrist stated @entity1 had been suffering from severe depression and paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the attack			1
the court heard how fellow students at @entity31 , where @entity1 had studied biochemistry , found him ‘ weird and paranoid ’			1
mental health issues : a jury convicted the 21 - year - old @entity31 student of manslaughter , finding him not guilty of murder , on grounds of diminished responsibility			1
after attacking his mother @entity1 dressed up in pink women 's clothes to try and fool neighbours into thinking she had gone to work the case of @entity1 echoes that of the ficitional character @entity186 , the protagonist of the novel psycho by @entity188			1
based on real - life murderer @entity189 , @entity186 is a fat , middle - aged drunk who has an unnaturally close relationship with his mother			0
@entity186 runs the motel his mother owns			0
but @entity195 is insane ; and when she suspects her son of desiring an attractive young guest , she sneaks into the girl 's room and stabs her to death as she showers			0
the case of @entity1 bears a resemblance to the character @entity186 from the film @entity203 @entity186 covers up the murder ; but @entity195 soon kills a private investigator hired to find the girl			2
during the course of the novel , which was adapted into @entity211 's film @entity203 in 1960 and again in 2000 starring @entity212 , the reader learns ' mother ' is in fact @entity186 himself , who developed a split personality after murdering his real mother and her lover in a fit of jealously			0
unable to bear the guilt he adopted her personality to try and convince himself that she was still alive .			0
