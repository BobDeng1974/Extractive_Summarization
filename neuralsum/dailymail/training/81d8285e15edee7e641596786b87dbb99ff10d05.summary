a @entity1 jury has heard the shocking moment a 65 - year - old homeowner shot dead two teenage intruders in his basement , and then told his female victim ' you 're dying ... b * * * *			1
' @entity9 recorded the double slaying in his @entity12 basement and on the second day of his murder trial the crystal clear audio was played to a silent courtroom , except for a woman holding back sobs			2
in the recording , glass can be heard breaking , movement , then two gunshots as @entity23 , 17 , groans , ' oh			2
' to this , @entity9 responds : ' you 're dead , ' the @entity25 reports			2
then the rustling of a tarpaulin can be heard and a dragging sound as @entity9 , breathing heavily , moves the teen into his workshop to stop his dead body staining the carpet			2
@entity9 shot and killed two teenagers who broke into his house on @entity43 2012 trial : the 65 - year - old faces two counts of premeditated first - degree murder for the killings of @entity49 , 18 , and @entity23 , 17 , who broke into his home on @entity43 2012 moments later , jurors heard the sound of a gun reloading and deep breaths			1
then a female voice mumbles ' @entity23			2
' it 's 18 - year - old @entity58 's cousin			2
again , gunshots ring out and then @entity49 falls down the stairs			2
@entity9 says ' oh , sorry about that ' and a terrified @entity49 screams ' oh my god ! ' the old man then says ' you 're dying , ' before shooting her again and calling her ' b * * * * ' twice			1
more dragging sound is heard and then a final crack of a gun , which is where prosecutors turned off the sinister recording			0
@entity9 is charged with first - degree premeditated murder in the slayings of @entity23 and @entity49 on @entity43 2012			1
the killings rocked the small central @entity1 city of about 8,000 and stirred debate about how far people can go in defending their homes			1
charged again : @entity9 had his charge increased from second degree murder to first - degree after killing two teenagers the horrifying audiotape came after jurors listened to an interview from the day after the shootings in which @entity9 matter - of - factly described what happened in chilling detail , telling authorities he finished @entity49 off with a shot under her chin because a .22 - caliber ' does n't go through bone very well			1
' prosecutors said during opening statements that @entity9 planned the killings and was lying in wait in his basement			1
@entity9 's attorney said his client was terrified after several increasingly violent break - ins and was hiding after he heard a window break and footsteps upstairs			1
' he became frightened and scared to live in his own home , ' said @entity9 's attorney , @entity106 , later adding , ' he began to wear a holster and pistol in his own house			1
that is how afraid he is , and became			0
' assistant @entity112 attorney @entity111 told jurors that @entity9 thought a neighbor girl had been breaking into his home			1
on that day , he moved his truck away from his house , sat in his basement ' and he waited , ' @entity111 said			0
' he 's down in the basement , in a chair , tucked between two bookcases at the bottom of the stairs			0
he said he was down there reading a book ... with his @entity127 , a .22 - caliber revolver , some energy bars and a bottle of water , ' @entity111 said			2
during the afternoon the jury was also shown several photographs of the basement where the shootings occurred			0
@entity137 forensic scientist @entity136 testified that the teens bodies were found partially wrapped in the same camouflage tarp			0
@entity49 ’s sweatshirt hood was up and her purse was next to her body			2
using gunshot residue , @entity136 said he was able to determine the two bullet holes in the hood of @entity49 ’s sweatshirt were likely made at the distance of about six inches and 12 inches - or point blank range			2
under @entity1 law , a person may use deadly force to prevent a felony from taking place in one 's home or dwelling , but authorities have said @entity9 crossed a line when he continued to shoot the teens after they were no longer a threat			1
the teens were not armed , but @entity9 told authorities he assumed they were - and he thought they had taken guns from his house in a past burglary			1
in the recordings , @entity9 can be heard politely recounting details to investigators			0
as the recordings were played monday , @entity9 sat still at the defense table , at some points crying			2

' he 's looking , facing up at me , and i shoot him in the face			0
i want him dead , ' @entity9 told investigators			0
@entity9 said he put @entity23 's body on a tarp so he would n't get blood into his carpet , dragged it into his workshop , reloaded his rifle and sat down			1
@entity9 described feeling adrenaline , and ' blood was pounding in my ears			0
' he said he also felt he was being ganged up on , something he called one of his ' red buttons			0
' so when he saw @entity49 come down the stairs minutes later , ' i killed her too			0
' he shot her , and when he tried to ' finish her off ' his rifle jammed and she laughed , he said			0
' i just pulled out the 22 and i shot her , ' he told authorities			0
he said he then pulled her into the workshop , but she was still gasping , so ' i did a good , clean finishing shot and she gave out the death twitch			0
' he said he did n't call police because the teens were already dead and ' just cause my @entity43 is screwed up i do n't need to screw up yours			0
' the next day , he asked a neighbor to call police			0

he is not guilty of murder			0
' assistant @entity112 attorney @entity111 told jurors that @entity9 thought a neighborhood girl had been breaking into his home , so on that @entity43 , @entity9 sat in his basement , waiting			1
@entity111 said @entity9 heard the door of his house rattle at about 12:30 p.m. , then someone walking across the deck , then a window breaking			0
' and he waited , ' @entity111 said			0
but @entity106 said his client was hiding after break - ins that had gotten increasingly more violent			1
' he became frightened and scared to live in his own home , ' he said of @entity271 , later adding , ' he began to wear a holster and pistol in his own house			0
that is how afraid he is , and became			0
' joker : friends remembered @entity23 as an out - going student who loved to make people smile prosecutors say as @entity23 descended the basement steps , @entity9 shot him in the chest , then in the back while @entity23 fell , @entity111 said			1
@entity9 fired a final shot into @entity23 's head , the bullet passing through @entity23 's hand , @entity111 said			1

@entity9 dragged @entity49 's body into the workshop and laid it on top of @entity23 's , @entity111 said			1
@entity9 told investigators he thought he heard @entity49 gasping , so he placed his revolver under her chin and fired what he told police was a ' good clean finishing shot to the head , ' the assistant prosecutor said			1
after their deaths , authorities said a car linked to @entity23 and @entity49 contained prescription drugs that had been stolen from another house , apparently the day before they were killed .			2

@entity9 , 65 , is on trial for killing two teenagers who broke into his home - @entity49 , 18 , and @entity23 , 17 - on @entity43 in 2012
prosecutors claim he had planned the killings and was lying in wait with two guns , a book and some *snacks*
his defense attorney argued that @entity9 was terrified after several increasingly violent break - ins
@entity1 law allows people to use deadly force when *protecting* their homes - but prosecutors claim he used more than necessary
