by @entity0 and @entity1 selfies usually seem like an exercise in narcissism			2
but today thousands of women shared striking shots of themselves at their most vulnerable , make - up free			1
and joining the campaign , the mother of former @entity9 star @entity8 took it a step further - by baring her reconstructed breasts			1
brave : joining thousands of women , @entity8 's mother took a shot of her post-surgery scars in support joined in : @entity8 tweeted her own version , fake tanned but without make up sharing the photos on @entity20 , miss @entity8 wrote : ' my brave mums ( sic ) no makeup pic for cancer awareness			1
' the reality tv star and glamour model , 27 , also shared her own , saying : ' ok so if my mum can bare her scars			0
here is my no makeup selfie nothing but my tan # @entity33 '			0
she later tweeted : ' my mum said she hopes her picture gives hope to anyone fighting against cancer who may be feeling desolate '			2
the campaign was created as a bid to raise awareness and money for breast cancer			1
the campaign , inspired by @entity48 ' @entity47 selfie , encouraged women around the world to get sponsored to go to work or on a night out make up free			2
everyone from cancer survivors to men in full drag have been posting pictures in on @entity20 and @entity56			0
she later added that her mother hoped to inspire cancer sufferers who feel desolte @entity60 says it 's not only important to raise awareness but to donate anything you can @entity65 , left , posted her no make - up selfie to @entity56 , as did @entity67 on the right celebrities including @entity70 star @entity70 also took part as people tweeted their images on @entity20 followed by ' @entity74 '			1
@entity76 , while not affiliated with the # nomakeupselfie hashtag , are supporting it however , to begin with the well meaning campaign seemed to have missed a big point because nobody appeared to be donating any money in support of those that had gone au natural			2
though nobody seems to know where the idea came from , the rule seemed to be that women post their picture and then nominate other female friends to do the same with all posting that the photos were to ' raise awareness of cancer ' yet with no mention of donating any money			1
it did n't take long for people to become a little bemused by the campaign - with many @entity56 and @entity20 users wondering what the point was if nobody was actually donating cold hard cash			0
luckily @entity76 have now cottoned on to the campaign and those posting the selfies or nominating others to do so can now text the word beat to 70099 to donate £ 3			1
@entity109 , director of communications at @entity76 said : ' the # nomakeupselfie @entity20 trend is n’t something @entity76 started – but it ’s great to see so many people getting involved to help raise awareness of cancer amongst their friends and family			1
