@entity0 has started charging users up to £ 10 to message celebrities and others outside their circle of friends			1
under the trial scheme , it costs 71p to send a standard message on the social networking site			2
but the fees vary depending on the popularity of the recipient , with a current maximum charge of £ 10.68 to contact celebrities such as @entity16 diver @entity15			1
top dollar : facebook users will pay £ 10.69 to contact celebrities including diver @entity15 , seen using his mobile phone during practice at the @entity22 before the start of the @entity24 popular : it will cost users more to send a message to the young @entity16 diver via @entity0 than to less popular , or non-celebrity users it puts him a tier above @entity34 gangster rapper @entity33 and @entity36 - winning author @entity35 , both of whom cost £ 10.08 to message			1
and in what may cause some embarrassment , many well - known figures such as broadcaster @entity41 and comedian @entity42 can currently be contacted for the standard charge of 71p			1
the fee structure is decided by a mathematical formula that takes into account a number of factors , including the number of followers a user has on @entity0 and how many messages they receive			1
charges to contact somebody using the system can rise and fall under the system			0
the fees were introduced for 10 per cent of @entity61 users as a trial at the end of last month with the plan to introduce it to all members of @entity0 in the country			2
sliding scale : the new charges depend on the popularity of the recipient so it will cost £ 10.08p to send @entity33 a message , while fans of @entity42 will pay just 71p to contact her via @entity0 the company said that the paid for ‘ priority messages ’ were intended to stop users from being bombarded with unwanted contact from strangers but @entity0 faced criticism yesterday after details of the costs became known , especially because it has boasted that ‘ the site is ‘ free and always will be ’			1
@entity83 , social media director at digital marketing agency @entity84 , tweeted : ‘ @entity0 charging users in the @entity61 to contact celebs online			1
seems a bit mean to charge someone to send fan mail			0
’ users who are @entity0 friends or who share mutual friends are still able to keep in contact with no charge			1
there is also a cap on the number of paid messages any user can receive			0
messages are sent directly to a recipient ’s inbox on their profile page			0
those who do n’t want to pay are still able to send a message , but these are not put into the recipients inbox but another box called in the “ other folder ” that most people rarely check and many do n’t even know about			0
the charge can be paid online instantly with a credit or debit			0
under - 18s are barred from making such payments and are also blocked from receiving unsolicited messages			0
@entity120 users in the @entity34 are charged $ 1 , $ 5 or $ 15 to send a priority message			2
@entity0 scrapped a $ 100 fee to contact the most prominent celebrities after it was mocked for applying the charge to contact the company ’s founder , @entity126			2
in @entity61 questions were also raised over the charging formulae after it emerged that one of those who it is most expensive to contact is @entity134 , the former children ’s laureate			0
users are also being charged the maximum £ 10.68 to contact a fake @entity0 account set up in the name of singer @entity138			1
@entity0 said : ‘ the system of paying to message non-friends in their @entity0 inbox is designed to prevent spam , while acknowledging that sometimes you might want to hear from people outside your immediate social circle			1
‘ we are testing a number of price points in the @entity61 and other countries to establish the optimal fee that signals importance			0
part of that test involves charging higher amounts for public figures , based on the number of followers they have			0
‘ this is still a test and these prices are not set in stone			0
’ scrapped : @entity0 had planned to charge a $ 100 fee to contact the most prominent celebrities but was mocked for applying the charge to contact the company 's founder , @entity126 adds up : the fee structure is decided by a mathematical formula that takes into account the number of followers a user has on @entity0			2

sliding scale of up to £ 10.68 to message those outside friendship circle
fans pay full price to contact diver @entity180 , but just 71p for @entity42
@entity0 says ' priority messages ' stop users being bombarded with spam
