of 6.9 million victims registered by the government , 6,743 are officially recorded as victims of sexual violence			2
but officials believe that is merely the tip of the iceberg due to the stigma of the crime			0

that amounts to an attack every 15 minutes			2

' @entity36 understands our work and our commitment to making visible the women who have been victims of sexual violence			1

' i want to empower women and help them understand that they have a right to justice			0
to make visible the crime of sexual violence and to make women realise it 's not their fault and there is no shame in what has happened to them			2
' i started working with displaced women six years ago and as we campaigned for change , threats against us increased and some of the women were raped			0
it did n't put me off because it is important that people of the world join together and eradicate sexual violence to stop this from happening to other people			0
