two miles below the surface of the ocean , researchers have discovered new microbes that ' breathe ' sulfate			1
the microbes , which have yet to be classified and named , exist in massive undersea aquifers — networks of channels in porous rock beneath the ocean where water continually churns , researchers say			1
about one - third of the @entity13 's biomass is thought to exist in this largely uncharted environment			1
sulfate is a compound of sulfur and oxygen that occurs naturally in seawater			2
it is used commercially in everything from car batteries to bath salts and can be aerosolized by the burning of fossil fuels , increasing the acidity of the atmosphere			0
microbes that breathe sulfate — that is , gain energy by reacting sulfate with organic ( carbon - containing ) compounds — are thought to be some of the oldest types of organisms on @entity13			1
' it was surprising to find new bugs , but when we go to warmer , relatively old and isolated fluids , we find a unique microbial community , ' said @entity49 , of @entity50 , who led the study			0

other species of sulfate - breathing microbes can be found in marshes and hydrothermal vents			1
microbes beneath the ocean 's crust , however , are incredibly tricky to sample			1
researchers from @entity50 and the @entity77 took their samples from the @entity79 ( off the coast of @entity81 ) , where previous teams had placed underwater laboratories , drilled into the ocean floor			2
to place the labs , they lowered a drill through two miles of ocean and bored through several hundred feet of ocean sediment and into the rock where the aquifer flows			0
' trying to take a sample of aquifer water without contaminating it with regular ocean water presented a huge challenge , ' said @entity96 , of the @entity97 ( @entity97 ) , which helped fund the research			0
the labs create a seal at the seafloor , like a cork in a bottle , allowing scientists to deploy instruments and sampling devices down a borehole while keeping ocean water out			0
to solve this problem , @entity97 created @entity109 ( @entity110 ) observatories			0
the moniker was basically dreamed up to fit the term ' @entity110 ' because these devices create a seal at the seafloor , like a cork in a bottle , allowing scientists to deploy instruments and sampling devices down a borehole while keeping ocean water out			0
samples were then shuttled to the surface by remote - controlled undersea vehicles or ' elevators ' — balloons that drop ballast and float samples gently up to the waiting scientists			2
like the microbes on the forest floor that break down leaf litter and dead organisms , the microbes in the ocean also break down organic material like dead fish and algae			1
unlike their counterparts , however , the microbes beneath the ocean crust often lack the oxygen that is used on land to effect the necessary chemical reaction			1
instead , these microbes can use sulfate to break down carbon from decaying biological material that sinks to the sea bottom and makes its way into the crustal aquifer , producing carbon dioxide			2
learning how these new microbes function will be important to getting a more accurate , quantified understanding of the overall global carbon cycle — a natural cycling of carbon through the environment in which it is consumed by plants , exhaled by animals and enters the ocean via the atmosphere			1
this cycle is currently being disrupted by man - made carbon dioxide emissions			0
' this is the first direct account of microbial activity in these type of environments , ' @entity49 said , ' and shows the potential of these organisms to respire organic carbon			0
