by @entity0 published : 14:45 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 16:35 est , 13 january 2014 passengers heard not one but two chilling announcements on a recent @entity5 flight from @entity6 to @entity7 , after their pilot suffered a heart attack at 30,000 feet			1
quick - thinking nurse @entity10 , from @entity11 , @entity12 , rushed to respond when crew asked over the loud speaker if any passengers had medical training			1
but as she was administering aid to the ' mumbling and incoherent ' pilot , another , distinctly more terrifying plea was heard : ' does anyone in the cabin have flight experience ? ' thankfully , the co-pilot managed to safely land the plane at an airport in @entity28 , but not before the unusual request thoroughly frightened all on board			1
mrs @entity10 was flying home via @entity7 with her husband and 16 - year - old daughter from a @entity43 vacation			2
when the first announcement was made the registered nurse with decades of experience was first to respond			2
she said she found the pilot slumped over in the cockpit			0
' he was sick and mumbling and was just incoherent , ' she told @entity50			0
the pediatric intensive care nurse , who only recently re-certified her advanced cardiac life support accreditation , noticed his heart was beating irregularly and determined he 'd probably suffered a blood clot or a heart - attack			2
scary : mrs @entity10 was flying home via @entity7 with her husband and 16 - year - old daughter from a @entity43 vacation when the two frightening announcements were made another nurse , @entity61 , of @entity62 , also volunteered to assist and the pair , with the help of other passengers , pulled the captain out of the cockpit and into the galley so they had more room to work			1
the nurses set up a diagnostic defibrillator and administered an @entity73 after the co-pilot took control of the airplane , mrs @entity10 said she turned to the woman and asked , ' you know how to land the plane , right ? ' and she said ' yes			1
' ' i felt immediately comfortable			0
that was just one thing i did n't have to think about , so i could focus more on what was going on with the patient , ' mrs @entity10 recounted to @entity50			0
but a second announcement was made , asking if there were any pilots in the cabin			0
' that kind of changed the story a little bit , ' mrs @entity10 ' husband , @entity89 , explained with a laugh			0
room to work : @entity10 and another nurse , @entity61 , pulled the captain out of the cockpit and into the galley , pictured , and after the flight landed safely he was met by paramedics , right , on the tarmac the co-pilot managed to land the plane without trouble and paramedics were waiting to treat the pilot on the tarmac			1
' @entity5 flight 1637 , a @entity109 operating between @entity6 and @entity7 monday evening , landed safely in @entity28 after the captain became ill , ' the airline said in a statement			1

' on the rescheduled flight the following day , mrs @entity10 sat next to the co-pilot who informed her the pilot had survived and was being treated in the cardiac unit of an @entity28 hospital			1
