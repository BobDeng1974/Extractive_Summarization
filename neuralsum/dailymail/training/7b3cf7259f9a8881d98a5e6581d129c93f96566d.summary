ladies , let ’s have a chat			2
high - heels : you are getting it all wrong			1
most of you don your heels and wobble about thinking that just because you have a pair of expensive - looking footwear on you , everything will fall into place			1
if you ca n’t manage to stay upright and look elegant then it ’s perhaps best you do n’t graduate above one or two inches			1
if the posture is okay , the gait is n’t , and vice versa			2
some of you look highly medicated when you teeter down high streets on a night out – the lack of length and tightness of your skirts not helping , either			2
due to having to teach deportment in my own etiquette classes , it came to my colleagues ’ and my attention that i really needed to do more than talk female clients through the theory of high - heels and lead by example			1
it was time to step up to the sling - backs and learn			2
what i ’ve found , coming to it as a total novice , is that i seem to do it better than most ladies			2
i almost had to intervene in the opticians the other day when i saw the assistant ’s heels that had bent ( from bad walking and standing ) to a perilous 45 - degree angle			1
in order to properly understand the art of walking in heels @entity14 invested in a pair of size 9 pumps so , armed with a pair of hot red four - inch stilettos , i enlisted the help of @entity61 , who , during the 1970s - 1990s , ran the @entity62 , to learn how to walk in heels			1
on @entity61 ’s newly laid kitchen floor i wiggled back and forth for an initial assessment before being politely corrected by the pro. my already excellent posture helped , apparently , but the positioning of the pelvis and hands are somewhat different for those who wish to wear heels , i learned			1
let ’s not pretend otherwise			2
you need training , and thanks to @entity61 , and some surreptitious practice at home , i am now somewhat of an aficionado and offer to you , dear ladies ( and the odd male ) , my guide on what you should be doing			2
the right shoes first you have to find a pair that fits and are moderately comfortable			2
heels should really never be over four inches ; unless you ’re attending a party where ‘ mutton dressed as lamb ’ is the dress code			1
generally , it is lower heels for daytime , higher for evening			1
too many women think they will look sexier the higher the heel			2
putting them on point toes , as if you are @entity101 , arch foot and slide into heel			0
wiggle those toes to spread out and settle in their new , rather cramped , home			0
posture before you can even think about moving , make sure you are standing correctly			0
so few of us today ( of either sex ) have good posture thanks to spending far too long slumped over computers			0
it defeats the object of wearing the heels in the first place ( to make you look confident and your legs look sexy ) if you shuffle or slouch along			1
roll your shoulders quite far back , imagine you are pushing them over a garden fence and back down the other side			0
your hands should be behind the seam of your trousers / skirt and your chin should be parallel to the floor			0
final prep … clench your bottom , tip your pelvis slightly up and let your hips take you forward … your waist plays no part in all this , it just remains straight and motionless			0
first steps push your weight through the pelvis			0
your ankle gets lifted up , knee bent and then straighten onto the floor			0
a traditional walk is heel - toe , and whilst in heels this is still true , it should n’t be as pronounced as when in flat shoes			1
whilst we are not trying to emulate @entity151 in the latest production of @entity153 , some find it helpful to picture a feline movement			0
stance too many women stand with their legs crossed – maybe they want to go to the lavatory ? correctly done , stand with your heels lined up ( a gap or two or three inches in between ) , your toes pointing in different directions , your right foot in front of the left			1
set off on the right foot literally ! with correct deportment , we always set off with the right foot leading			0
step in time have some rhythm about your gait , but take your time over medium - length strides			0
give us a twirl if you do ever need to turn around , and wish to do it with flare , swivel on the toes of your left foot , so you can set off again on the right foot			1
when seated to show off your legs and shoes cross your legs and rest one ankle on your other leg ’s shin			0
the straight and narrow as you walk , imagine you are walking down an invisible straight line			1
we do n’t want to look like we ’re on a catwalk , placing one foot directly in front of the other ( too many young girls think that is the be-all - and - end - all of a stiletto ) , but imagining such a line will help you from walking along imaginary tram lines			0
best foot forward well , sort of			0
your heel should be ‘ on ’ the imaginary line			0
your toe should be pointing off			0
they key , however , is never rush ! i know many reading this will initially feel uncomfortable about the sight or thought of a man in heels			1
i can assure you , i have no further desires to explore the realms of women ’s clothing and accessories			0
but i felt if i was to fairly critique women on their walk , i had to give it a go myself			1
many girls learn just by , at best , putting a pair of their mother ’s on and tottering around their houses ; others , at worst , decide they ’ll use their first time out clubbing to learn			0
it often takes an outsider to point out a social group ’s flaws and so i hope my guide will be of some assistant in quelling the gaggle of girls who tend to look more elephant than elegant			1
