it was the most treasured craft in @entity2 's possession when the @entity3 declared war , but all of the @entity7 sea planes were thought to be long - lost after being gunned down in @entity8			1
the nation 's only long - haul vessel , the 40 @entity7 flying boats were dispatched over the @entity12 and @entity13 to keep advancing submarines at bay			1
but as the @entity13 upgraded their equipment over the years , the entire fleet was obliterated by being gunned down into the sea			1
exciting : this is what historians believe could be the only intact @entity23 flying - boat in the world as the others were gunned down in the @entity26 prime : the craft was treasured by the @entity30 's commanders and @entity31 as the only planes that could fly long - haul			1
they were used to deter @entity13 u-boats but decades on , in 2000 , one of the prized crafts has been found wrapped in coral 65ft below the coast of @entity40 in what historians are touting as one of the most important discoveries this century			1
and though it is in bits , the thick coating of mud and barnacles have preserved the @entity7 's structure perfectly			1
now , 73 years since it sank in 1940 , naval historians are on the cusp of finally piecing the unique vessel back together in a project worth half a million pounds			2
a deep sea diver accidentally discovered the wreckage after seeing a lobster - pot had become snagged on something below the waves 13 years ago			1
the diver followed the rope down to the seabed and came across the world ’s only surviving @entity65 flying - boat			1
experts identified the craft as @entity69 of @entity70 , @entity30			1
extraction : a major operation is now under way to lift the components out from the @entity40 sea bed			1
pictured here is a @entity7 propeller being raised onto shore last pilot : wing commander @entity80 , pictured left aged 20 in 1940 , was the last pilot to fly this @entity23 when he was training a young aircrew			1
now aged 93 , @entity82 is helping the @entity83 to identify different parts			0
he hopes the discovery will make people remember the work those pilots did prized : the first were created in 1937 and by 1948 they were already being used by the @entity30			0
pictured here is a @entity7 taxiing up the slipway at @entity92 in 1943 to confirm the identity , they tracked down the bomber 's last pilot : 93 - year - old wing commander @entity82 obe			1
@entity82 was aged 20 in 1940 , training young aircrews , when he flew the @entity7 out of @entity92 , in @entity98 , the day before it sank			1
he said : ' i flew it on a routine flight around the dock and then moored it up			0
' there was a gale during the night and it must have been holed by some floating debris and down it went			0
' in the morning it was n’t there			0
well , it was at the bottom of the sea			0
' @entity7 flying - boats flew out of @entity92 during the @entity26 - when they were used to attack @entity13 u-boats sinking vital supply ships			1
newer models were created over time but for the large part of the war , @entity30 commanders adapted the @entity65 , which was feared by enemy crafts tarnished : now in pieces and covered in barnacles , historians are desperate to piece it back together to recreate the 1940s state - of - the - art model between 1940 and 1943 , @entity31 made it repeatedly clear to his troops that he wanted u-boats to be a priority , writing : ' ... the only thing that ever really frightened me during the war was the @entity136 peril			1
' more than 6,000 @entity30 aircrew were killed during the @entity26			1
more than a year before the first prototype was built , the @entity30 ordered 21 production examples of the @entity23 flying - boat			2
with a deeper hull and turrets on the nose and tail , it was a military version of the @entity147 crafts used by @entity148			0
desperate to roll out the new model , the @entity149 filed an order in 1937 to strengthen defences			0
the first was received in @entity154 in june 1938			0
by the start of the war , they had a fleet of 40 , which acted as one of the major components of the @entity2 's overseas operations for at least the first few months			1
in total , 75 were built			0
initially , it carried 910kg of bombs , mines and other weaponry			0
a year into the war , amendments were made to combat @entity171 tactics			0
two @entity174 machine guns were attached to the wing , a second gun was added to the nose turret , and constant speed propellers and deicing boots were installed			2
many were kept at @entity180 ( above )			0
@entity82 , who now lives in the village of @entity182 , @entity183 , was an instructor at a training unit based in @entity92 when he last flew the plane in 1940			0
aircrews would have to fly up to 600 miles out into the @entity12 to escort convoys and attack @entity13 submarines who were slowly starving the @entity2 into submission			1
they would be sent out across the oceans to intercept @entity13 u-boats using co-ordinates picked up by the secret codebreakers at @entity197			1
having been brought in to work on the 15 - year project , @entity82 became patron of the @entity83 in 2001 and has helped identify the parts of the plane dive teams have raised from the seabed			2
the operation costs thousands of pounds , and it was only this year that the @entity83 managed to extract the front two turrets of the flying - boat			2
they hope to have the entire vessel extracted and pieced back together in about a year 's time			2
@entity82 said : ' sunderlands were the only long range @entity2 aircraft which could reach the middle of the @entity12 for the first couple of years of the war			1
' we would fly out day and night to patrol around the convoys and protect them			0
' if you were lucky you would sink a submarine			0
but just by being there you could force submarines to submerge and not get in a position to torpedo our ships			0
' ships crews would say once they saw us overhead they felt they were safe , which was very nice			0
' everyone rightly commemorates the sacrifices of @entity229 airmen but it ’s almost as if our contribution has been forgotten			0
' hopefully this @entity7 will help tell the story of what the crews of the flying - boats did for the nation			1
' @entity237 , who is project manager @entity83 , said : ' we now have the world ’s only @entity65			1
' we have identified it as @entity69 of @entity70 , @entity30 , which sank at its moorings in a gale in november 1940			2
' there was no crew on board and the aircraft was lost for decades before being re-discovered by divers			1
' despite all the years in the water it is immediately recognisable			0
' much of it is covered in mud and sediment - which has preserved the structure and turned it into a perfect time capsule			2
' two of its massive @entity257 radial engines and propellers have been raised from the wreck and are now being conserved and displayed in our museum			0
' the @entity83 was set up to preserve and protect the plane wreck and have begun raising it from the seabed			0
mr @entity237 , who is running the conservation operation , said : ' @entity80 has visited a number of times and has been a tremendous support to us			2
' he piloted this plane and brings that incredible personal link with him - he would ’ve heard the engines roar into life all those years ago			2
time capsule : the mud and barnacles covering the structure have preserved it			0
experts are now matching the propellers they have lifted up with pictures like this ' since the plane was first re-discovered around the millennium our volunteers have spent thousands of hours raising the plane in parts			2
' this year we have raised a significant part from the turrets at the front of the aircraft and we intend to raise as much as we can from this unique wartime survivor			2
' to raise it all is a massive undertaking but we intend to bring up as much as we can by the 75th anniversary of its sinking in 2015			0

@entity65 was @entity2 's only long - haul aircraft at start of @entity8 and used to deter @entity13 u-boats
@entity31 , who saw u-boats as the biggest *threat* , valued the 40 - strong fleet *highly*
most gunned down in the @entity26 , which killed 6,000 , and experts thought they were lost to history
a diver found one off @entity40 coast , identified as a @entity7 by its last pilot , wing commander @entity80
