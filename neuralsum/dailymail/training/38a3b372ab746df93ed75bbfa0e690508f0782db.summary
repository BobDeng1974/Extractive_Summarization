it 's billed as the most technologically advanced cruise ship ever built			2
so it 's ironic that i ca n't connect to the @entity4 on my @entity5 as i set sail on @entity7 - but it 's only temporary			1
i 'm one of the first guests on board the world 's first smartship , sailing from @entity13 to @entity14 and back before it makes its way to @entity16 on sunday and relocates to the @entity17			2
the vessel sails from @entity13 to @entity14 and back before it makes its way to @entity16 on sunday and relocates to the @entity17 jewel in the crown : @entity25 , a @entity27 - style pod on the top deck lifting passengers 300ft above sea level , offering thrilling views there , passengers will be able to connect to the ultra-fast @entity34 technology , not yet available in the @entity35 , but @entity36 promises it will be by the time its next liner , @entity7 arrives here in the spring			1
at 1,141ft long , @entity7 is the length of 41 @entity27 buses and longer than five @entity40			1
it ’s the third largest cruise ship in the world , making for an impressive sight as it docked in @entity13 on friday			1
but looking like rows of floating flats , it 's not the outside that 's the attraction			0
@entity49 boasts robotic bartenders serving cocktails , a skydiving simulator , a world - first digital entertainment system , on - board dodgems , and virtual balconies in windowless rooms			1
and then there 's the jewel in the crown - @entity25 , a @entity27 - style pod on the top deck lifting passengers 300ft above sea level , offering thrilling panoramic ocean views			1
it 's the ultimate ship designed with tech - savvy holidaymakers in mind			2
cutting - edge technology : the whirring blue robotic arm bartenders that shake and stir your poison according to your tastes the ship 's architecture is complemented by a multi-million dollar , 2,980 art collection including this a huge butterfly wall by the glass lifts the passenger pod , similar to the capsules on the @entity27 , offers 360 - degree panoramic views of the ocean guests can find swimming pools , sunbeds and hottubs - as well as a bar serving drinks throughout the day on @entity89 and the digital experience begins before guests even leave home - where they can check in online as well as book on - board dining , spa appointments and shore excursions			1
the checking in process is efficient			0
from arriving at the port in @entity13 to taking my first step on @entity102 takes about seven minutes - none of the usual airport queues			0
the incredibly designed @entity102 , which took three years to build and weighs 167,800 tonnes , certainly delivers on its ' wow factor ' promise			0
there are 18 decks , 2,090 staterooms , 16 glass elevators , and room for a staggering 4,905 passengers and 1,500 crew members			1
once on board , it 's a case of what to do first			0
decks four and five are lined with elegant @entity120 - style restaurants , bars and shops selling everything from pints of beer and slices of pizza , to champagne and diamonds			1
the indoor active space @entity129 on level 16 boasts on - board dodgem cars as well as a a circus school with flying trapeze , and roller skating located next to a rock - climbing wall , the jewel of the ship ’s art collection is a 30 - foot magenta polar bear on the exterior deck @entity142 16 boasts @entity129 - the world 's first skydive simulator at sea - as well as @entity25 , a five - star spa , a surf simulator , a climbing wall , and @entity148 , the largest indoor active space at sea , with gaming , a circus school and bumper cars			1
@entity154 is where guests can find swimming pools , sunbeds and hottubs - as well as a pool - side bar playing music and serving drinks throughout the day			0
and the showstopping @entity163 entertainment venue – featuring vast , floor - to - ceiling glass walls spanning three decks and offering 270 - degree panoramic sea views – with its five - star lounge - style seating , and chic cocktails , is on levels four and five			1
inside , the ship 's awesome architecture is complemented by a multi-million dollar , 2,980 art collection – from a huge butterfly wall by the glass lifts , and on - board galleries , to the 30ft - tall magenta polar bear made from stainless steel triangles standing proud on the ship ’s exterior deck			2
my 11th floor statecabin is spacious and modern , boasting usb plugs , a flat - screen tv , a double bed , a sofa and blue , grey and cream decor , as well as plenty of storage and a shower room - although toiletries are only available upon request			0
there 's also a balcony with two chairs affording an impressive ocean view			0
the passenger pod , similar to the capsules on the @entity27 , offers 360 - degree panoramic views of the ocean room with a view : the pod suspends passengers out over the side of the ship for unparalleled views across the ocean weighs 168,666 gross tonnes 1,141 feet long - 2.5 longer than the @entity213 of @entity214 is tall cruising speed : 22 knots - faster than @entity217 's average by a bow space for 4,905 guests in total and 1,500 crew 136 feet wide - three times wider than a basketball court boasts 2,090 staterooms ( 375 with virtual balconies ) @entity228 pod takes guests 300ft above sea level four bow thrusters produce 4,694 horsepower each - equal to 24 f1 cars ship is three times the size of the @entity235 ; 11 times bigger than a blue whale cost £ 133,000 per berth to build for those in windowless rooms , virtual balconies are available – a full - length screen showing a boat ’s eye view as the vessel travels ; but it comes at an extra cost			1
my wow wristband gives me access to my room - as well as allowing me to make purchases ; in theory linking to on board app @entity253 , which guests can use to manage their holiday - but it does n't work efficiently during the pre-inaugural voyage , so i resort to the old - fashioned method of writing everything down instead			2
the wristband also takes away the need to ever carry around cash - which is potentially dangerous with plenty of high - end shops dotted around			2
on decks four and five are where most of the 18 restaurants are located - including @entity269 ; @entity271 's first outlet at sea ; and @entity273 , which offers an experimental dining ‘ experience ’ in an glamorous and quirky setting			1
in a concept called @entity280 , the cruise ship 's traditional main dining room has been ' reimagined ' as five complimentary restaurants			0
no free - for - all buffet here			0
instead , these are elegant , well - thought - out eateries offering five - star dining , adventurous dishes and top - notch wines , with waiters using tablets to communicate orders immediately with the kitchen			0
these are the types of restaurants you would want to dine at even if you were n't at sea			2
guests have the opportunity to dine in some of the restaurants free of charge , while others ( including @entity269 ’s @entity301 ) have an extra fee attached			1
after a ride on the @entity25 , which takes us on an incredibly high , but very smooth ride , i enjoy champagne in the chic @entity308 , before dining in the luxurious @entity309 , which specialises in steak and fish dishes			0
a member of staff demonstrates the @entity314 by @entity316 skydiving simulator at the back of @entity7 @entity7 ' robot bartenders - the first of their kind in the world - prove to be yet another form of entertainment on the ship when @entity163 becomes an entertainment venue at night , it uses six ‘ roboscreens ’ that move or unite as one to entertain passengers our waiter is friendly and helpful , and the food is superb , everything is faultless			1
even though i 'm full the dessert menu is not to be passed on - and i finish with a calorific red velvet sponge cake smothered in cream			0
the evening does n't end there			0
as well as a production of @entity341 , guests can book to watch the exclusive show @entity342 in the spectacular @entity163 venue - the screen technology is incredible , offering a backdrop only rivalled by theatres but without the need for the space			0
after that , there 's a late - night casino on deck three - with designated smoking areas , which is odd to see inside - with card tables and slot machines flashing their lights until the early hours , as well as tribute bands playing in bars , piano players tinkering late into the night , and djs taking the party on until the next day			0
around every corner there is something whirring , something to touch , something to taste , or something to experience			0
the cruise ship is filled with shops and 18 restaurants and bars to keep passengers entertained on board @entity36 owns the world ’s three largest cruise ships – @entity377 , the @entity378 and the @entity7 @entity7 boasts 18 decks and has room for 4,180 guests			1
the ship is three times the size of the @entity235 i place my order for a drink courtesy of the whirring blue robotic arm bartenders , that shake and stir your poison according to your tastes			2
there ’s a queue already , with people having to wait nine minutes for their order – but there are no groans of frustration , as the bionic staff prove to be entertainment enough			0
@entity36 says it has created the ship with the modern holidaymaker in mind - and that it opens cruising up to a younger , tech - savvy audience			1
but it adds that although @entity7 is designed with technology at its fore , guests can choose not to use it			2
however , with the digital concept at the heart of what ’s on offer on board this smartship , it ’s not the type of vessel to travel on if you want to switch off - but it 's perfect if you are switched on			1
it 's the future of cruising ... or , at least , it will be as soon as the @entity4 connection works .			0

@entity36 ’s new vessel is third largest in world carrying 4,905 passengers
billed as the world ’s first smartship with robotic bartenders and skydive simulator
