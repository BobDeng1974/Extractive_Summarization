@entity0 has backed @entity2 defender @entity1 to carry on improving and challenge for a place in the @entity5 squad in the near future			1
@entity5 boss @entity7 opted for @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 as his four centre back for the upcoming internationals with @entity14 and @entity15 at the end of the month			1
but @entity1 has been in impressive form for @entity2 in recent months as they moved away from relegation danger			2
@entity1 has been in brilliant form for @entity2 recently and could be in line for an @entity5 call @entity0 has back his centre back to keep improving and draw @entity7 's attention to him but @entity0 says that @entity1 , 28 , has his best years ahead of him and can carry on improving			1
he said : ‘ he is a good age and is coming into his prime age as a centre half and he has a lot of experience under his belt at this level			0
‘ he has not surprised me in terms of his character because he plays with an honesty in every game			0
he has been very impressive since i have been here and his confidence is high			0
he hit a pass out to a left winger at the weekend that @entity40 would have been proud of			0
‘ he has some good players in front of him and they have a lot more experience at that top level than he does			2
‘ i do n’t think he should be disappointed he has not made this squad			2
he is playing well at the moment and it is there for all to see			0
what will be , will be , but his best years are still in front of him			0
’ for @entity0 personally , he would love to see a @entity2 player called up to the @entity5 squad			1
@entity53 was the last @entity2 player to be called up to the @entity5 squad back in 2012 and @entity0 says his players must find their place in the @entity56 first			1
@entity1 is 28 but @entity0 says he has his best years ahead of him and has been impressed by his character @entity58 , who was also left out of the @entity5 squad , loses out in an aerial challenge to @entity1 @entity53 was the last @entity2 player to be called up for @entity5 in 2012 in his previous spell at the club @entity0 would love to see a @entity2 player called up to the @entity5 squad during his time as manager @entity67 ’s rapid assent into @entity7 ’s squad is something that @entity0 admires and hopes he can unearth someone of his quality			1
he added : ‘ there have not been too many @entity2 players in the @entity5 squad in recent years and it would be nice to get someone in that squad			1
sometimes when a team has just been promoted and you are in your second year , you have not got the foundations yet to be proven to show you are good enough at that level			0
@entity67 has won a place in the @entity5 squad and @entity0 has been impressed with his quick progress ‘ our boys are fighting for their status and you need to gain that			1
‘ to be fair to @entity67 he has done that in a very quick time at a top club , and that is difficult to do , so hats off to him			2
‘ lets hope we can produce someone of his ilk as he is a real example to players up and down the country			0
