the @entity1 's three presidents collected the @entity2 today in recognition of six decades of work promoting ' peace and reconciliation , democracy and human rights '			1
prime minister @entity9 stayed away - one of six @entity1 leaders who decided not to attend			1
instead , deputy @entity11 got his own day of peace , attending alone to represent the @entity13 in the splendour of the @entity15 in @entity16			1
lavish : political leaders and dignitaries gather for the @entity19 at @entity20 , @entity21 the @entity22 in @entity16 was host to the prime ministers of @entity25 during the @entity2 2012 attendees heard @entity28 president @entity27 praise the @entity1 's role in transforming a @entity25 ' continent of war ' into a ' continent of peace '			1
he said : ' that should not be taken for granted - we have to struggle for it every day '			2
mr @entity27 emphasised that the same prize had been awarded in the 1920s to the foreign ministers of @entity40 and @entity41 marking @entity43 reconciliation			1
then in the 1930s the continent had degenerated into conflict and war once more			2
but he said now was the time to celebrate prolonged peace - and welcome the @entity40 and @entity41 leaders sitting side by side in @entity16			2
however , the announcement of the peace award in october caused surprise and controversy in the midst of one of the @entity1 's worst crises and at a time of deep - albeit non-violent - rifts between major member states			1
today 's ceremony comes in the week of yet another @entity1 summit to try to resolve the continuing euro - crisis which , according to @entity13 @entity66 leader @entity65 risks ' engendering violence , poverty and despair across @entity25 '			1
a peaceful day for this deputy : @entity11 arrives at the @entity20 for the @entity2 presentation president of the @entity74 @entity73 , president of the @entity76 @entity75 and president of the @entity79 @entity78 hold the @entity2 certificate and medal , after accepting it on behalf of the @entity1 but @entity76 president @entity75 said : ' this is an award for the @entity25 project - for the people and the institutions - that day after day , for the last 60 years , have built a new @entity25			1
' we will honour this prize and we will preserve what has been achieved			2
it is in the common interest of our citizens			2
and it will allow @entity25 to contribute in shaping that ' better organised world ' in line with the values of freedom , democracy , human rights and rule of law that we cherish and believe in			1
' the last 60 years have shown that @entity25 can unite in peace			1
over the next 60 years , @entity25 must lead the global quest for peace			1
' speaking after the ceremony , @entity11 said : ' today 's prize is a tribute to the people of @entity25 , not an institution			1
' for centuries , the idea of @entity25 and peace was a contradiction in terms			1
' the fact that we have not been to war with our neighbours for nearly 70 years now is a testament to the sacrifices of the generations that have gone before us and the hard work since			0
' coming from a family that was brought together in the safety of @entity13 after suffering the horrors of both world wars in different parts of the globe , this prize has particular resonance			1
' at the start of what will be another busy week for @entity25 cooperation it has been helpful to speak to @entity136 , @entity137 and other leaders about pressing issues such as banking reform and the @entity141			1
' @entity21 's @entity142 , left , @entity21 's @entity143 , second left , @entity21 's crown princess @entity144 and @entity21 's @entity145 attend the @entity2 ceremony @entity143 and crown princess @entity144 of @entity21 applaud during the ceremony meanwhile , with more than 1,200 guests and 40 chefs , @entity148 will holds its annual awards ceremony hoping a year of cost - cutting will not be noticed by the laureates , royals or the @entity155 of @entity148 attending the lavish dinner			0
the ceremony tops a week of events in @entity159 for the winners of the literature , physics , chemistry , medicine and economics prizes that see @entity148 briefly enjoying the kind of extravagance usually associated with previous centuries			0
but this year the prize money has been cut by a fifth , contracts with suppliers have been renegotiated and even the number of chauffeur - driven cars for @entity28 winners and their guests has been reduced			0
some wonder whether guests will perceive any austerity in the week 's events - which last year cost around 20million @entity148 crowns ( £ 1.8million ) and usually feature @entity148 's best cooks , designers and musicians , as well as thousands of flowers flown in from @entity188			0
making peace : @entity25 leaders gather for a photograph after the ceremony hopefully peaceful discussions ... @entity41 chancellor @entity136 , left , and @entity40 president @entity137 talk as @entity188 prime minister @entity194 looks on ' there have been some cuts , ' @entity196 executive director @entity195 told reporters , but refusing to give any details			1
' you will not notice them			0
' for more than a century , the foundation has managed the roughly $ 450million ( £ 280million ) capital that forms the base for the awards , donated in the will of dynamite inventor @entity207			0
but in recent years returns have suffered amid the global crisis			2
' we are in this forever and we should safeguard it ( the prize ) , ' said @entity195 , a former @entity148 central bank chief known for reducing staff during his tenure			0
the awards are now worth $ 1.2million ( £ 0.74million ) each , down from around $ 1.5million ( £ 0.9million ) in recent years			0
still , this evening 's festivities at @entity159 's @entity20 - itself decorated with 11 kg of gold leaf - are unlikely to be spartan			0
details of the menu are only revealed minutes before the food is served , but guests at the event - touted as one of the world 's biggest set dinners - will eat from some 7,000 pieces of porcelain using 10,000 items of silverware and drink from 5,400 glasses			0
chairman of the @entity235 @entity27 speaks in @entity20 during the @entity2 2012 award ceremony space is so tight guests are asked to avoid going to the toilet between courses to avoid jams in the aisle			0
there will also be a fair share of bling , from jewel encrusted handbags to glittering tiaras , as @entity148 's small and influential political and business elite jettisons its famed egalitarian image to hobnob with diplomats and political leaders from around the globe			0
the strict dress code - white tie and tails for men and gowns for women - is complemented by a similarly strict code of behaviour			0
toasting , for example , is done @entity148 style : raise your glass , look your table companions in the eyes , swing the glass in the air ever so slightly - no clinking - sip and repeat eye contact before setting the glass down			0
the formality is in stark contrast to neighbour @entity21 where @entity276 pop - princess @entity275 features when the @entity1 is handed this year 's @entity2 at a ceremony in @entity16 on monday			2
the @entity1 's win raised a few eyebrows when announced in october			2
and @entity28 week in @entity148 has attracted its share of controversy with literature winner @entity282 steering clear of human rights issues and refusing publicly to back a petition by fellow laureates to free jailed compatriot and @entity2 winner @entity287			0
the @entity196 , which organizes the prizes , will be hoping the dinner retains enough glamour , despite this year 's cost cuts , to divert any attention away from such issues .			0

all but six prime ministers of @entity25 turn up to see @entity296 awarded to the @entity1
but @entity9 stays home , leaving @entity11 to represent the @entity13
