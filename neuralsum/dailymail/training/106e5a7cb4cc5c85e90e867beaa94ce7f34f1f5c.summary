moral stature : @entity1 said @entity2 should not be re-signed by @entity3 because football players should ' set a good example ' @entity1 is a remarkable woman			1
she is the reigning @entity6 heptathlon champion and the finest all - round female athlete this country has produced			2
and in a glittering international career spanning a decade , she has never uttered a contentious word nor expressed a controversial opinion			2
until last week that is , when she announced that she wanted her name removed from a stand named after her by @entity3 , if the club offers a contract to the convicted rapist @entity2			1
‘ those in positions of influence should respect the role they play in young people ’s lives and set a good example , ’ she said			2
‘ if @entity2 was to be re-signed by the club it would completely contradict these beliefs			1
’ the view was simply stated , yet the effect was devastating			2
in the space of two sentences , she seemed to have ended all speculation that the rapist would be allowed to carry on collecting £ 20,000 a week for playing professional football in @entity37			1
@entity2 was released from prison in october , having served two - and - a - half years of a five - year sentence for raping an intoxicated 19 - year - old woman			1
his victim , whose identity was revealed on social media , has suffered vicious abuse , has been forced to leave her home town , and change her identity			2
more than 157,000 people signed a petition urging the club not to take back the player			2
now , if @entity2 had been a mundane performer , then he would have been sacked with a great show of lofty disapproval			1
but he is not mundane – he is their star , a man who is worth a lot of money			2
so the club did nothing , and waited for the initial storm to abate			2
they then , discreetly , allowed him to resume training			2
there were strong arguments on both sides			0
many believed @entity2 had served his time and should be allowed to resume his profession ; others thought his offence too heinous for easy forgiveness , and cited the fact that he had shown neither a scrap of remorse for his offence , nor sympathy for his victim			1
but @entity1 ’s intervention may well prove decisive , for she enjoys the moral stature of one who represents something decent in sport and in society			1
football can make no such claim			0
pretentiously , it calls itself ‘ the beautiful game ’			0
rarely can beauty have seemed so morally repugnant			0
@entity2 served half of his five - year jail term for raping an intoxicated 19 - year - old woman the popular cliche suggests the game is played by a posse of sexual predators , managed by a gaggle of garrulous chancers and controlled by owners whose financial backgrounds might not withstand intensive scrutiny			1
it is an exaggeration , but it contains an element of truth			0
awash with money at its higher levels , football has developed a disturbing sense of entitlement			0
‘ i want , i can afford , therefore i must have ’ is the mantra			0
the average @entity111 player ’s salary is £ 2.3million per year			1
these physically gifted , sparsely educated men earn almost 60 per cent more than their contemporaries in @entity114 , home of the current world champions			1
@entity117 players at clubs such as @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 are paid between £ 4million and £ 5million a year			1
but then the @entity111 clubs pick up an average of £ 155million per season from a £ 1billion a year television contract , as well as the massive overseas rights			1
most of this finds its way back to the players , which is as it should be			1
far less palatable is the largesse skimmed off by agents – odious leeches who contribute little to the game yet plundered almost £ 97million last year			1
@entity137 said she wanted her name removed from the stand at @entity141 if @entity2 was re-signed @entity142 was when clubs were owned by landed gentry or local businessmen who ’d made their pile and wanted to make their mark			1
today it ’s oil - rich sheiks or oligarchs with fortunes of mysterious provenance			0
all has changed , and the general sense of opulence now extends even to the boardroom of the @entity158			0
in the summer , at the @entity160 in @entity161 , the @entity158 chairman @entity159 was presented with a gift bag by the @entity161 fa			1
he brought it home and left it in a corner of his study			0
he was later informed it contained a £ 16,400 @entity169 watch			2
@entity159 was shocked , and confessed he had received half a dozen watches in his year at the @entity158			2
mercifully , the era of racial or homophobic insults is fading , but the raucous filth of the chanting is something which continues to shock			0
i recall @entity177 , when manager of @entity179 , enduring a disgraceful afternoon at @entity180			0
@entity177 , who is not an unworldly man , later spoke with disgust at the insults which players and managers are required to endure from foul - mouthed dullards			2
despite bid leaders knowing @entity187 did not stand a chance of being given hosting rights for the 2018 @entity160 , prince @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192 were sent to @entity194 headquarters in @entity195 ‘ and some of them have their children with them , ’ he said			1
‘ @entity201 kids , watching their fathers make those evil gestures and scream those words			0
if they did it in the street , they ’d be arrested			0
why should football grounds be different ? ’ last week ’s revelations from @entity194 on the report into corruption were unquestionably damaging to the game ’s tainted image , yet the prevailing reaction was of scorn			1
world football ’s governing body is institutionally unscrupulous , so much so that it scarcely troubles to deny the fact			0
it is also miserably incompetent			0
thus it could commission an investigation into the scandal of the @entity160 bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments , and then , when the probe failed to deliver the required whitewash , order a ‘ precis ’ of the report which flatly contradicted the original document			1
but the @entity158 had no cause for disdain , following the spectacular shambles of its own 2010 @entity160 bid , when trumpets were sounded and the starry trio of prince @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192 were dispatched to @entity195 to help plead the @entity237 cause			1
privately , as some of us had discovered , the bid leaders knew beyond doubt that @entity187 had n’t the remotest chance of success			1
but that did n’t stop the @entity158 ’s shameless wooing of disgraced @entity194 executive @entity246 , with a job offer for one of his pals and a £ 35,000 dinner that sticks in the craw			1
and they allowed the prince , the pm and the nation ’s favourite son to humiliate themselves by seeking votes from the rascals			0
it was a repellent spectacle			0
and yet , at its best , football has much to offer			0
it can captivate and beguile			0
it can enthuse the young , enthral the old and ignite the imagination of those who have followed it so faithfully			0
but the sad old game has not been at its best for some time			0
it was never so wealthy , never so widely watched , yet never so little loved			0
desperately , it seeks a clear , resonant voice , one which articulates the values it used to embrace			0
and last week it gained such a voice in @entity1			1
we must hope it finds the wit to listen .			0

@entity1 asked for her name to be removed from a stand at @entity141 if @entity3 re-sign convicted rapist @entity2
the average @entity111 wage is £ 2.3m per year and top players can earn between £ 4m and £ 5m per year
@entity187 *'s* @entity160 bid team were *criticised* by @entity194 for trying to woo the vote of former *vice-president* @entity246
