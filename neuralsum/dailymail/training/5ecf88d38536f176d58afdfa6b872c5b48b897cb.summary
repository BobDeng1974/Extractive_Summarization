by @entity0 @entity1 is wanted by @entity2 and may well end up there			1
it is understood from sources close to the situation that meetings have recently taken place to this end			0
although @entity11 , the @entity2 chairman , and @entity1 fell out in 2007 , the animosity may not prevent a reunion			1
@entity11 wants to sign a big name			1
@entity1 is struggling to obtain success at @entity16			1
@entity2 's partnership with @entity18 , which starts next year , offers an obvious attraction			1
off track : @entity1 - taking part in practice on thursday - has endured a difficult season with @entity16 interest : @entity2 are courting @entity1 , who left the @entity25 team ( right ) after he fell out with @entity11 in 2007 as does the fact @entity27 , the new de facto team principal , is unconnected to the 2008 turbulence			1
the notion of @entity1 leaving @entity16 was fuelled this week , when he said : ' it is sometimes strange to see good comments and compliments from people outside the team , and the opposite from people who are supposed to be close to you			1
' it 's motivating for me and to see good comments and is funny when you see the opposite from your closest friends			2
' this outburst prompted @entity16 president @entity44 to issue an unusual statement - cum - love letter			0
he said : ' @entity1 is the best driver in the world , who always gives 200 per cent in the races			1
' @entity1 may end up staying , but at this stage i would be tempted to put a fiver on him going to @entity2			1
tough going : @entity51 , pictured here in practice , and team - mate @entity54 have struggled in 2014 the only problem that people in @entity57 have ever had with alcohol has been trying to walk down the gangway			2
but while the champagne - fuelled roistering is in full swing on lilting yachts , miserable plans are afoot to ban all alcohol advertising from sport , including @entity67			1
in an echo of the ban on tobacco advertising , a pincer movement is starting to move across the continent			1
@entity73 has already outlawed alcohol advertising : what we call the @entity77 is called the @entity77 just over the border from @entity57			1
other countries will follow suit , experts say , and then the @entity82 will introduce a @entity84 - wide ban			2
@entity85 have included a ban in their draft manifesto for next year 's general election			2
this move is bad news for the likes of @entity92 with their martini sponsorship , @entity94 with @entity95 , and @entity2 with @entity96			2
in all , drink advertising brings Â£ 300million into @entity25 sport			2
the @entity99 ( @entity100 ) , the @entity101 ( @entity102 's ) and @entity103 ( @entity104 ) would all lose out			0
dr @entity106 , head of behavioural studies , at @entity108 , @entity105 makes the case for the ban			0
it sounds sanctimonious rubbish to me but here goes : ' @entity67 has displayed such strong leadership in ensuring their driver safety , so it seems odd that they remain happy to promote alcohol given its a factor in around one third of all road fatalities in western nations			1
i 'll drink to that : @entity92 ' title sponsor this season is alcohol brand @entity126 ' we know that young people are particularly influenced by alcohol sponsorship and advertising , with those exposed to alcohol marketing early in life more likely to be problem drinkers later in life			2
unfortunately , young men are also much more likely to die from drink driving than any other group			0
' expecting a few anti-drink driving messages to reduce the problem of drink driving in the face of a 1000 times more " please drink alcohol messages " along with heavy alcohol discounting , defies logic			0
' if you really thought you needed to address alcohol consumption and drink driving you would not put alcohol and driving together in the first place			0
' @entity67 has some of the most intelligent and decent folk you could meet , but you really do n't need to be smart to know that alcohol and driving cars do n't go together in any context			1
but young people watching @entity67 could certainly gain that impression with the current alcohol sponsorship arrangements			1
' @entity73 took the global lead in banning alcohol sponsorship and advertising , and it did n't affect the success of sport in their country			1
indeed they hosted the very successful 1998 @entity168 , and won it ! perhaps @entity67 can be the moral leaders of international sport and be the first to ban alcohol sponsorship and advertising			1
' i have never heard anyone in @entity67 say that they want alcohol advertising banned			1
it seems illiberal to me			0
people , i would argue , should be able to decide for themselves whether they want to buy drinks or not			0
where will all this legislation end ? with bans on drinking in public places ? driving seat : @entity183 leads the drivers ' championship by three points from team - mate @entity187 @entity183 said this week that he is ' hungrier ' for success than @entity187 because he , unlike his team - mate , was not born into privilege			0
now think if @entity187 had made the claim in reverse			0
if he had said his more expensive education , for example , made him better equipped for @entity67			2
i think @entity183 was on to something , though			0
there is a certain chippiness to @entity183 and his father , @entity200 ( and i say that more admiringly than critically )			0
@entity200 , it always struck me , had a sense of ' @entity183 and me against the world , ' derived from their lowly beginnings as a poor immigrant family			0
this is part of what made them so successful and @entity200 such a power for good as a father			0
rivals : @entity187 and @entity183 , posing with girlfriend @entity213 ( right ) , are battling for the title as promised last week , i returned to the track at @entity57 to sample the new , quieter engine noise			0
would it , i wondered , damage my enjoyment of watching the cars at close quarters , especially around the swimming pool			0
the answer is yes and no. yes : because there was a lack of sheer screaming violence			0
no : i was not deafened			0
i feel my quandary is shared by many within @entity67 .			2

*unsettled* @entity1 could be in line for a reunion with @entity2
@entity11 wants to sign a big name but fell out with @entity1 in 2007
the @entity235 could be tempted back with @entity2 's @entity18 partnership
plans are afoot to ban alcohol from all advertising in sport including @entity67
