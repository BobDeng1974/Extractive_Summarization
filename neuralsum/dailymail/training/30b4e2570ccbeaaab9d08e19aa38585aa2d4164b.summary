the dirty linen was out in public long before the local launderette cut off @entity3 ’s credit and told the players to wash their own kit from now on			1
by that point , on wednesday evening , the team bus had already been repossessed , £ 400,000 of medical and gymnasium equipment was gone in a bailiff ’s van and an advert had appeared online			0
it showed a picture of a bench from the dressing room at the @entity16 — or lot no 7 , if you prefer			0
it will be auctioned with a base price of £ 1,465 on march 5 , with the money going to the creditors of this broken club			1
‘ sometimes it feels like football is having a joke with us , ’ says @entity23 , the editor of parmafanzine.it			0
they have been patrolling the gates for days , a mixture of journalists and supporters usually in place from 8am to 8pm			0
‘ we thought you might be @entity65 , ’ he says			0
@entity65 is @entity65 , the unpopular new club president , though he is not the most responsible for the £ 145million of debts that smashed this club into pieces			1
players and staff have not been paid since the summer ; many creditors have waited longer than that			0
those debts meant last sunday ’s game against @entity75 was postponed because @entity3 could not pay their stewards			1
this weekend ’s game at @entity78 will go ahead but the players are likely to pay for their own hotel			1
@entity65 made late arrangements for a coach after the squad spoke publicly about pooling their cars			0
these are bleak , rotten times for the club at the bottom of @entity30 and it ’s about to get worse			1
the mayor of @entity3 has been demanding a meeting with @entity65 but the latter keeps cancelling			1
administration appears certain and the local press predict this club will soon be dissolved and re-formed in amateur football			1
@entity3 celebrate winning the 1999 @entity96 after beating @entity97 3 - 0 in @entity98 in 1999 @entity3 's players celebrate their @entity96 triumph in unique fashion @entity102 and @entity103 ( right ) were two of the high - profile stars @entity3 attracted in the 1990s @entity105 ( right ) was another of the big - name stars who helped @entity3 to glory in the 1990s @entity32 ( left ) and @entity109 were part of the 1999 @entity96 winning team in 1999 , @entity3 won the @entity96 - its fifth @entity113 trophy in seven years			1
the team that defeated @entity97 3 - 0 in @entity98 was littered with stars			0
@entity3 ( 3 - 2 - 3 - 2 ) : @entity109 ; @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 ; @entity119 , @entity120 ; @entity121 , @entity105 , @entity122 ; @entity32 , @entity123 subs : @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity103 , @entity130 manager : @entity132 there are fears that @entity3 , remarkably , might even have to pull out of the league midway through the season			1
‘ of course you wonder how this mess was allowed to happen , ’ @entity23 adds			0
‘ we had a good and sensible club not very long ago			2
look what these people did to us			0
’ the story , in the first instance , goes back to the @entity145			0
@entity3 had been delightfully successful through the whole decade , picking up four @entity113 trophies as well as three @entity35 cups and finishing runners - up in @entity30 their squad included @entity109 , @entity118 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity105 , @entity103 and @entity32			1
when they were beaten by @entity154 in the @entity155 in 1999 it was a big result for the @entity157 side			2
no one predicted how much they would have in common down the line			0
@entity3 supporters protest in the city ahead of their cancelled @entity30 game against @entity75 on sunday the supporters have been angered to see a once - great club fall to the point of near - oblivion this season a fan hangs a sign reading ' @entity169 per @entity170 ' or ' @entity171 ' on the gates on @entity3 's stadium police officers look on as the supporters march through the streets in protest at the financial mismanagement @entity3 's ground is closed off but they still have over 100 players on their books who have not been paid for @entity3 , the route from the @entity155 to here is odd and mysterious			1
when @entity44 bought the club for £ 21m during the 2006 - 07 season , the club ’s gross debt was a manageable £ 12m			1
since then @entity3 have acquired a barely believable playing staff of 240 players , with the vast majority out on loan , including @entity191 and @entity192 at @entity193			1
the @entity3 view has long been that ‘ this is the project ’ without detailed explanations of how the business would work , though it is understood the plan depends on paying little and sending players elsewhere to be developed			1
if the player comes good , the club can sell for profit			2
if not , the overheads per player are relatively low			0
however , as one well - placed source put it : ‘ these were not just young players who would be very cheap with potential — some were 27 , 28 , 29 , 30			0
these players will cost the club more money			2
’ the scale of the operation was reported in 2013 by @entity35 newspaper @entity214 , who calculated more than 300 transactions had taken place for only £ 5.5million			1
the club has previously been described in the same pages as a ‘ cattle market ’			2
‘ like everything else , there has been no transparency , ’ @entity23 says			0
to that end , it is unclear how much that unique business model might be responsible for the mess the club finds itself in			2
the source added : ‘ it is hard to say , but the feeling is that these transfers have really not been good			0
’ signs that something was seriously amiss financially only came in the summer			0
having finished sixth in @entity30 last season , @entity3 were prevented from taking part in the 2014 - 15 @entity96 because of an unpaid tax bill of € 300,000			1
the club captain has placed blame firmly at the door of @entity3 's current president @entity65 @entity242 says he would happily captain @entity3 in @entity244 , which could be what the future holds @entity44 huffed and puffed but had no answer			1
in december , having run up such monstrous debts , he sold the club to @entity251 businessman @entity250 for € 1			2
captain @entity242 claimed the squad felt ‘ betrayed and taken for a ride ’ by @entity44			0
@entity250 never met the players and also sold the club for € 1 after less than two months as owner			2
@entity257 came @entity65 and one of his first encounters with the squad proved memorable			0
‘ he showed us a bank document stating there was € 100m available to invest in @entity3 , ’ said @entity242			1
‘ we had some doubt			0
’ so far @entity65 has offered only excuses for repeatedly missing meetings with mayor @entity266 , who said : ‘ the rapport with @entity65 is beyond repair			0
’ public prosecutors have set a date of march 19 for a bankruptcy hearing and the seizures of property continue most days			2
on wednesday , a member of club staff entered the training ground with two bags of toilet rolls , understood to have been bought with a collection from the players			2
the misery is all around this once big club , including the gates of the stadium which carry the banner : @entity169 per rapina			2
in @entity287 , ‘ closed for robbery ’			0
@entity32 , the club ’s youth coach , summed it up			1
‘ we are in shambles , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s difficult to see the club in this state			0
we ’re having to take showers with cold water and my players have got ill. ’ emails to the club have gone unreturned , though @entity51 has been told by a source that there might be a good reason — the company that leased @entity3 their computers and printers recently reclaimed the equipment			1
dirty laundry is the least of @entity3 ’s problems			1
@entity32 is a youth coach at the club and said players have been getting ill due to a lack of hot water the former @entity313 striker called @entity3 a ' shambles ' in an interview with the club 's own official website			1
