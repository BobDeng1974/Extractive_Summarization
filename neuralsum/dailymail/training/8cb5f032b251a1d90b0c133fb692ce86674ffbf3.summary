by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:45 est , 11 june 2012 updated : 05:44 est , 12 june 2012 @entity2 yesterday admitted he played a key part in the ‘ risky ’ appointment of former @entity6 boss @entity5 as the @entity7 ’ chief spin doctor			1
the chancellor said he had accepted an assurance from mr @entity5 , who had resigned from the newspaper in the wake of the phone hacking allegations , that there were no more revelations to come			1
in evidence to the @entity17 , mr @entity2 revealed that around a third of his meetings with media owners and editors since 2005 were with @entity22 – including one meeting with the @entity24 at a ski chalet in @entity26 , @entity27 , in early 2009			1
no secret pact : mr @entity2 denied that a meeting with the @entity24 , him and @entity29 to seal election backing never happened pals : mr @entity2 said he remained friends with @entity5 but ' sadly ' had not been able to talk to him for more than a year mr @entity2 also said he had been at a crucial no 10 meeting where it was decided to remove responsibility for deciding the @entity38 bid from business secretary @entity39 and handing it to culture secretary @entity40			1
that idea , he said , had come from sir @entity42 , then no 10 ’s permanent secretary and now the cabinet secretary			2
the chancellor said his main concern when mr @entity39 was caught boasting he had ‘ declared war ’ on the @entity49 empire in 2010 was to come up with a solution that would not mean the business secretary being sacked or having to resign			1
mr @entity2 suggested that would have threatened the @entity52			2
claims : former prime minister @entity55 , leaving the @entity17 and his wife @entity54 today said the @entity7 had done a deal with @entity57 , which mr @entity2 said was nonsense mr @entity2 dismissed the idea that the @entity7 entered into some sort of deal , either explicit or implied , with @entity49 to hand him full ownership of @entity38 in return for the support of his papers			1
in an apparent reference to @entity55 , who suggested in evidence to the inquiry that he believed such an arrangement had been made , mr @entity2 said only a ‘ real fantastist ’ could believe such a ‘ vast conspiracy theory ’			2
controversy : @entity73 heard that mr @entity2 had fought to save @entity39 's job despite his going to war with @entity49 comments he said the @entity77 would have had to have somehow arranged for mr cable to be ‘ secretly recorded ’ by a newspaper saying he had declared war on the @entity24 so that responsibility could then be handed to mr @entity40			1
‘ it is complete nonsense and the facts simply do n’t bear it out , ’ he said			2
mr @entity2 insisted he had not had a strong view about the merits of the @entity24 ’ £ 8billion takeover bid for @entity38 , adding : ‘ as far as i could see it was just going to cause us trouble one way or the other			2
’ the chancellor said it had been clear that if the deal was approved by the government , it would offend one set of newspapers and broadcasters who were opposing the takeover , while if it was blocked it would offend the @entity49 camp			1
pressed on his own attitude to the proposed takeover , the chancellor replied : ‘ as far as i could see , it was about increasing the shareholding in a company that most people would think they ran anyway			2
’ on mr @entity5 ’s appointment , mr @entity2 said the former editor denied knowing anything about phone hacking at the @entity6 going beyond one single reporter			1
as shadow chancellor , he said he briefly asked mr @entity5 about phone hacking in march 2007 , when he was attempting to recruit him for the job of director of communications for the @entity77			1
links : lobbyist @entity118 gave evidence to @entity73 last month and had sent hundreds of texts and e-mails to the government about the @entity38 bid he said he had asked mr @entity5 ‘ in a general sense , as you might do in a social encounter , whether there was more in the phone hacking story that was going to come out , that was not already public , that we needed to know about – and he said no ’			1
he said he had been aware of the ‘ risks ’ and potential controversy that would be generated by hiring mr @entity5 , but recommended to @entity29 that he should get the job			1
‘ it was not a consideration : let ’s hire the @entity139 man			2
it was : let ’s hire this very experienced ex-newspaper editor , ’ mr @entity2 added			2
he said he still regarded mr @entity5 as a ‘ personal friend ’ , but added : ‘ sadly i ’ve not been able to speak to him for a year			1
’ big day : the chancellor pictured arriving at the @entity147 to appear after former prime minister @entity55 the chancellor yesterday sent the strongest signal yet that the government will not adopt plans for regulating the press that stifle freedom of speech			0
@entity2 rejected proposals to separate news and comment , the ‘ kitemarking ’ of newspapers or allowing ‘ class action ’ complaints by offended groups			0
he also warned against attempting to draw up a code that defined what was in the national interest			0
mr @entity2 said that if the @entity17 came up with proposals that target print media but exclude the internet , everyone involved would have been wasting their time			1
his remarks echoed those of education secretary @entity170 , who insisted press freedoms must be preserved at all costs and warned @entity73 that any cure could prove ‘ worse than the disease ’			0
they suggest an emerging consensus among @entity77 ministers appearing at the inquiry			0
on thursday , @entity29 is also expected to ‘ put down a marker ’ that the government will not accept over-the - top proposals on press regulation			0
lord @entity73 said he had heard evidence from groups who felt ‘ very disadvantaged ’ by how they were portrayed in the @entity152 , mentioning the disabled , migrants and those who change gender			0
asked if he agreed there should be some mechanism for such groups to complain about or prevent negative coverage , mr @entity2 replied : ‘ there are laws to prevent racial discrimination or sexual orientation discrimination			0
' you mention immigrant groups – they are obviously some of the most vulnerable people in our society			0
equally there ’s a huge concern out there ... about immigration controls			0
‘ if that ’s not allowed to be aired , then i think we stifle public debate			0
’ he insisted it was vital that the @entity152 could air views that were not fashionable or shared by the @entity215 – citing the example of @entity218 opinion			0
he said that a decade ago it was regarded as ‘ faintly eccentric ’ to be against @entity221 membership of the euro , with such views disparaged by the @entity224			0
but newspapers including the @entity226 , the @entity227 and @entity228 had campaigned against euro membership and contributed to what ‘ in hindsight was one of the most important economic and political decisions ’ ever made by @entity221			0
however , mr @entity2 said the @entity234 required a ‘ complete overhaul ’ and that victims of press mistreatment needed ‘ better redress ’ .			0

@entity5 was ' the best man for the job , ' he told the @entity17 , *discussing* why he appointed him as *no.* 10 spin doctor
he added that he wanted @entity39 to keep his job despite saying he had ' declared war ' on @entity49
any conspiracy to hand the decision to @entity40 was nonsense , he added
