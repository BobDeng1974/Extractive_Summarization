a @entity1 government website aimed at girls between the ages of 10 and 16 attracted attention its creators likely did n't want on friday , as news emerged that it includes graphic information about sex acts along with advice about puberty and disease			1
@entity12 was spotted - and lambasted - by @entity13 , a conservative website			1
but the government program was launched in 2002 , during president @entity16 's first term in office , and acquired its racy content during his second term , in 2006			2
historical versions of the website , kept available online at @entity23 , span nearly eight years and confirm that the graphic sexual language first appeared sometime between october 2005 and june 2006			1
today 's @entity12 is updated with a modern look , including social media tools and celebrity interviews , all calculated to appeal to girls - including the very young @entity12 's ' about this site ' page describes it as a health resource website for girls as young as age 10 while many parents might want 10 - year - old girls to know that sexual molestation is wrong , few would teach kids that young about ' mutual masturbation			1
' but the government - run website 's glossary provides a frank definition in language seemingly calculated to appeal to ' tween ' female audiences , the government - funded website takes girls through everything from their first menstrual cycles to health issues related to homosexuality			1
but the frank language in its glossary definition of anal sex - ' sex that involves putting the penis in the anus , or butt ' - is likely to shock even parents who are used to seeing sex education programs in public schools			1
definitions of ' mutual masturbation ' and ' oral sex ' are also included in the glossary , aimed at millions of girls who have not yet reached puberty			1
@entity70 : which is more appropriate for a fifth - grade girl ? @entity74 ( @entity75 ) , then - deputy @entity1 assistant secretary for @entity76 , led the implementation of @entity12			1
@entity78 , the computer company founded by billionaire two - time presidential candidate @entity80 ( r ) , won a $ 16 million contract extension in 2006 to continue working on that website and others the @entity1 @entity84 awarded its first contract in 1998 to @entity86 , a @entity87 , @entity89 company tasked with building and managing a handful of health - related websites for the federal government			1
@entity78 , the company founded by multi-billionaire and former presidential candidate @entity80 , acquired @entity95 that same year			0
@entity80 won a $ 16 million contract in 2006 to continue the work - a contract that specifically mentioned @entity12			1
it was in that year that sexually explicit language first appeared on the site			2
in a twist worthy of @entity104 , the personal computer maker @entity102 acquired @entity106 systems in 2009 , meaning that the company millions of parents trust to provide their children with computing resources is also teaching many of their fifth - graders about anal sex			1
@entity115 secretary @entity114 may be busy with pans to implement @entity117 : her office did n't respond to questions about the @entity12 website @entity121 ( @entity75 ) was @entity84 secretary throughout @entity16 's first term in office when the website was launched			2
@entity125 ( r ) took over the agency during @entity16 's second term , and was at the helm when the graphic information about sex acts was added @entity74 , the principal deputy assistant secretary for health at @entity84 , was reportedly behind the development of the @entity12 website			1
she entered federal government service in 1987 , during the @entity134 administration , as an @entity136 laboratory trainer and rose through the ranks , later being promoted to found the @entity139 's @entity138			0
' we have nothing to sell but health , ' @entity140 told a @entity145 interviewer in 2007			0
she described the content on the @entity12 website as ' @entity1 government - source information , that ... can be trusted to be based on the most credible science			1
' neither @entity140 ' office , nor that of hhs secretary @entity114 , responded immediately to emails seeking additional information about the age groups targeted by the website 's sexually explicit material			2
do n't blame me - it 's just another @entity158 trick ! it 's all part of my global health ' strategery ' you know , i really wish i 'd thought of that ! one online exercise helps young girls to dispel misconceptions about sexual activity by clicking on them to reveal ' the truth			2
' one of those elements focuses on pregnancy prevention via the ineffective ' withdrawal ' method			0
' my boyfriend says he 'll just pull his penis out before anything happens , ' girls visiting that web page read			0
clicking brings them to a screen reading , ' the truth : it takes a lot of self - control for a guy to pull out			0
also , some sperm can come out before a man ejaculates ( " comes " )			0
' digital snapshots of the website maintained at @entity23 show that in addition to descriptions of anal and oral sex , and mutual masturbation , when the website was updated between late 2005 and mid- 2006 , it acquired new information about date rape , ejaculation , sexual intercourse and a host of sexually transmitted diseases			1
no change was made , however , to the state age - range of its target audience			0
the website 's 2002 - era feel was a cross between @entity208 and unicorns other new vocabulary , however , included sections on virginity and sexual abstinence			0
the @entity16 administration launched a major initiative in 2006 aimed at promoting abstinence - only sex education among late - teen and 20s audiences			2
at the same time , similar messaging began to appear on @entity12			0
some of that language is still available on the website			0
' few people regret waiting to have sex , but many regret starting early , ' one section reads			0
' read on to see why abstinence - not having sex - makes a lot of good sense			0
' other sections , however , presume the very young target audience is already sexually active , even as they promote abstinence the page containing that language , according to a notice on the website , was last updated in october 2010			0
this helpful exercise , aimed at girls as young as 10 , dispels myths about the withdrawal method of birth control during sexual intercourse			2

explicit information about anal sex , mutual masturbation and oral sex is in the glossary at @entity12 , a site aimed at girls as young as fifth grade
a conservative website sounded the alarm , but the website and its graphic content came long before @entity256
federal health regulators awarded a $ 16 million contract in 2006 to operate that website and others , to a company now owned by @entity102 computers
