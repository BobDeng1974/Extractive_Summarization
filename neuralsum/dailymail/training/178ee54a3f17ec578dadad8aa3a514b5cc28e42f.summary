@entity1 hairdo : the sine crenes hairstyle symbolised chastity and was worn by brides on their wedding day as well as the @entity7 the hairstyle of @entity9 's @entity7 has been recreated on a modern head for the first time			1
a @entity13 hairdresser has painstakingly ' reverse engineered ' the ' do - thought to be @entity9 's oldest - and shown how it may have been carried out			1
the @entity7 were the priestesses of @entity16 , goddess of the hearth , and their sacred duty was to guard the fire in her temple , which was linked to the prosperity of @entity9			1
chosen before puberty and bound by a vow of celibacy , their braided hairstyle , known as the sini crenes , was a symbol of their chastity			1
@entity32 , a @entity33 - based hairdresser and amateur archaeologist , has unravelled the secrets of the @entity37 ' braids and recreated it for the first time on a modern head			1
she reported her findings last friday at the annual meeting of the @entity43 in @entity44 and published a @entity46 video detailing showing how it was replicated			1
' in ancient @entity9 's @entity48 six virgins guarded a sacred flame , ' she said			1
' during their 30 years service to the goddess , the vestal virgins were constrained by strict vows of chastity			0
' in exchange , they enjoyed enormous prestige and legal privilege which was denied to other @entity9 women			2
their guardianship of @entity16 's sacred flame was believed to ensure the continued existence of the @entity9 state and its people			1
' both brides and the @entity7 wore an ancient hairstyle called the sine crenes which the @entity9 associated with chastity			1
' since her first inspiration after an ' accidental encounter ' with an ancient bust in a @entity33 museum , ms @entity32 has devoted the past seven years to a detailed study of @entity9 hairdressing			2
in that time she has shown how many ancient hairstyles were achieved			0
but the sine crenes presented her with particular challenges since the @entity7 are almost always presented wearing layered headdresses which covered much of their braids			2
however , hailed as it was by contemporary sources as the oldest hairstyle among the ancient @entity9 , studying it gave her the opportunity to recreate what is perhaps the oldest recorded hair fashion			1
full regalia : hairdresser and archaeologist @entity32 's attemps to recreate the sine crenes were complicated by the layered headdresses worn by the @entity7 , like the one shown here how to : ms @entity32 reported her findings last friday at the annual meeting of the @entity43 in @entity44 and published a @entity46 video detailing showing how the sine crenes was replicated elaborate : ms @entity32 was able to complete the full sine crenes in 35 to 40 minutes working alone with only @entity9 - style tools			1
but she believes that several slaves working together could have had it done in 10 minutes @entity9 's @entity7 , a group of six hand - picked women , held unparalleled positions of status as some of the city 's most senior religious leaders			1
they had rank and a level of self - government denied to normal women and as priestesses of @entity16 they were responsible for maintaining the soul of @entity9			2
but their power and status came at a cost			0
chosen from nobly born families at a young age , @entity7 had to commit to maintaining their virginity for the duration of their posts - at least 30 years			2
when the girls , some as young as six , were sent by their families to become vestals they became brides of the city itself			0
with @entity9 as their guardian , any sexual relationship with a citizen was considered an act of incest which amounted to treason , a crime punishable by death			2
@entity16 was a powerful goddess of fire			0
@entity9 believed that as long as @entity16 's sacred flame was kept burning then the city and its civilization would endure			1
it was the duty of the six priestesses to tend this fire on a daily basis			0
if it faltered it was seen as a bad omen for @entity9 and its associated military campaigns			2
allowing the sacred fire to die out would lead to the @entity153 responsible being taken to a darkened room by the @entity155 ( chief priest ) where she would be stripped and beaten			0
the college of the @entity37 was regarded as fundamental to the continuance and security of the @entity9 state , and their hairstyle represented the vow of chastity they gave at their ordination			1
the religious significance of @entity16 's sacred flame made her priestesses a powerful and influential force in the @entity9 state , and they were included in nearly all major dedications and ceremonies			1
the college of the @entity37 was disbanded and the sacred fire extinguished in 394 , by order of the @entity174 emperor @entity173 such was the power of their myth , the theologian @entity175 felt compelled to write @entity176 in response to rumours the downfall of @entity9 was due to disrespect shown to the old gods who had protected the city for 1,000 years			2
ms @entity32 had just one bust available for study which showed the braids in enough detail to ' reverse engineer ' the hairstyle enough to work out how it was done			0
using that bust , ms @entity32 tracked the braids back to the part of the head where each must have originated			0
' it 's like weaving , ' she told @entity198			0
' every weaving pattern shows its marks			0
' the virgins ' hair was first separated into six sections and braided into separate braids , including two that ran cornrow - style across the top of the head above the ears			2
hair around the hairline was wrapped around a length of cord which was tied at the nape of the neck , while any that was leftover around the face was weaved into a seventh , final braid			0
the first six braids were then brought around the back of the neck and tied in pairs in half - square knots , with their ends wrapped up to the front of the head and fastened to the cornrow braids			0
the seventh braid was finally coiled round to the back of the head and tucked beneath the knotted braids			0
ms @entity32 was able to complete the full hairdo in 35 to 40 minutes working alone with only @entity9 - style tools			1
but she believes that several slaves working together could have had it done in 10 minutes or less			0
it takes waist - length hair to properly pull off the sine crenes , ms @entity32 said			0
but her research indicated that there were workarounds for @entity37 who suffered from hair problems .			0

@entity7 guarded the sacred flame of @entity9 and their hairstyle was a symbol of their chastity
contemporary sources identify the style , also worn by brides on their wedding day , as the most ancient of the @entity9 civilisation
