there were no winners when a two - metre carpet snake slithered away with an empty stomach after spending four hours trying to swallow a possum whole			1
photographs of the epic battle were snapped by @entity8 truck painter @entity7 at his @entity10 house - west of @entity11			1
mr @entity7 and his cousin were enjoying a few beers on saturday when they were interrupted by a loud bang			1
' they made a lot of noise when they fell off the roof and then rolled around on the concrete for a bit fighting			0
' there was a big bang as they hit the hand rail [ of the stairs ] and the concrete			2
' and it seems the possum did put up a bit of a fight as mr @entity7 said it took the snake 30 minutes to kill the marsupial before feasting			1
' the snake started eating the possum 's head first and he slowly worked his way up the body of the possum , ' he said			2
while mr @entity7 snapped pictures of nature taking its course , he heard ' a lot of grunting ' from the possum while it was still alive as the snake coiled itself around its prey			1
' the noise from the snake when eating was like heavy breathing , ' he said			2
mr @entity7 said it took the snake four hours from about 8pm for it to reach the possum 's hind legs			1
but it proved to be too big of a mouthful for the snake because it started regurgitating the possum - which was 40cm long - back up			1
it took half an hour for the snake to kill the possum before it started eating it the snake took about four hours trying to eat the possum after a loud bang was heard by mr @entity7 and his cousin @entity80 's leading snake expert , @entity79 , said that by the standard of carpet snakes , this was n't actually large			1
' i 'd say this was about 8 foot , and they can get up to 10 foot long , ' mr @entity79 said			0
carpet snakes are found all across @entity80 , with this particular variety , a @entity11 carpet snake , found all along the @entity91 coast			0
' i catch these more than any other snake , because they 're obviously quite big and move slowly , ' ' they normally live up a tree , and people will come out into their yard and see one there and freak out			2
' mr @entity79 has over 30 years experience with snakes and other reptiles , having discovered and named over 300 types of snakes all over the world			0
he said that he often feeds roadkill to snakes , but that snakes in the wild have a harder time digesting animals			0
' a snake that eats something the size of that possum runs a good risk of dying , because if the food goes cold in it 's stomach it will start to rot before it 's digested properly , ' @entity111 said			2
' septicemia will set in and the snake will die			0
if you feed a snake road kill in captivity , they have a much higher chance of survival , because they can keep warm and allow the food to digest			0
' mr @entity79 said that this particular carpet snake probably regurgitated the possum because it got ' nervous			0
' ' it 's certainly big enough , it should n't have had any trouble getting it down			0
i 'd say it got a bit scared of the bloke taking the photos and vomited it up so it could leave			0
' mr @entity7 and his cousin were having a few beers before they saw the snake and possum who fell off the roof the snake abandoned the possum after four hours after trying to eat it , stopping just before the marsupial 's hind legs the snake then gave up and regurgitated the possum back up , leaving mr @entity7 with the clean up he said he had heard the possum grunting while it battled for its life and the snake heavily breathing as it ate			1
