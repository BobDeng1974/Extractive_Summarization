she had never lost faith as the crown wobbled , never doubted her filly ’s ability , and trainer @entity5 was emphatically vindicated on sunday as @entity6 scorched to a two - length victory in the @entity8			1
the margin of victory from @entity11 may not have been as big as last year ’s five - length procession in the mud but it was probably even more emphatic or , as the track announcer bellowed , ‘ extraordinaire ’			0
unbelievable , he could well have added as she sprinted clear of @entity19 ’s third @entity18 and @entity23 ’s @entity22 hero @entity20 in fourth , both making excellent efforts from poor draws			1
@entity6 leaves the chasing pack for dust en route to another victory at the @entity31 @entity18 ’s jockey @entity32 thought he would win turning for home			1
he said : ‘ i just saw this flash of @entity6 up the inside — she is some horse , is n’t she ? ’ @entity6 is one of the greats now but few who watched her crab - like gait in defeat at @entity41 in june or her fourth in last month ’s @entity42 — a performance that had vin ordinaire written all over it — would have put much money on her becoming the first back - to - back @entity47 winner since alleged in 1978 and the seventh dual winner			1
this is a filly with ropey feet and a dodgy back who could not be ridden for six weeks in the summer as she rehabilitated after her @entity41 setback			1
her 11 - 1 starting price reflected that			0
minutes after her first win 12 months ago , bookmakers were handing out quotes of 2 - 1 that she would be back in the @entity47 winner ’s enclosure			2
@entity60 sheds a tear after riding @entity6 to the first back to back wins at the event since 1978 @entity60 , riding @entity6 ( c ) celebrates after crossing the finish line to win at the @entity67 race track replacing jockey @entity68 with @entity60 , at @entity70 ’s insistence after @entity6 had been beaten in the @entity71 and @entity72 , was part of the masterplan			1
perhaps to assuage the hurt , 43 - year - old @entity68 had insisted last week that the 2014 @entity6 was a mere shadow of the 2013 model , all of which must have made the result yesterday hard to swallow , especially when a broken ankle meant he missed @entity6 ’s first success here , too			1
@entity68 ’s comments seemed to make @entity70 bristle with indignation as she promised to prove him wrong ... and she did			2
as @entity68 passed the post in ninth on @entity89 , it must have felt like a blow to the solar plexus			0
a later victory in the @entity93 on @entity95 - trained @entity94 , in the colours of his boss and @entity6 ’s owner sheik @entity99 , must have been scant compensation but he was putting on a brave face			0
@entity6 crosses the line two lengths in front of second placed @entity105 @entity68 said : ‘ this was the @entity6 of old			1
unfortunately when i rode her here ( in the @entity71 ) she was n’t like that			0
’ but @entity68 ’s judgment was not too wild as @entity5 admitted @entity60 had initially recommended retirement for @entity6 after her @entity111 defeat			1
the trainer , who has now won three @entity113 after first landing the race in 1979 with @entity115 , said : ‘ i want to say thank you to @entity117 because he always believed what i told him			2
‘ a lot of people were saying @entity6 was no good and was finished and i asked him to have faith in me			2
it is not a surprise — she is the best			0
‘ in the @entity111 she was beaten but she did an incredible time in the ( home ) straight			0
i was sitting next to my @entity127 and he said , “ do n’t rule her out of the @entity47 ”			0
’ @entity129 collects the trophy while trainer @entity5 ( @entity131 ) stands behind displaced jockey @entity68 had previously claimed that @entity6 was not the same horse anymore @entity127 is @entity134 , 90 , a four - time @entity47 - winning trainer himself , who still keeps an eye on his daughter ’s stable			1
he had convinced himself that the filly was still good enough to win and phoned his old friend sir @entity138 last week to advise the 96 - year - old former @entity140 horseracing commentator to back @entity6			2
interestingly , all the first four raced prominently throughout			0
the hopes of @entity142 were dashed again and annoyingly @entity143 , the first of their trio in sixth , sped home from an impossible position .			0

@entity6 , ridden by @entity129 won the @entity149
trainer @entity5 never lost faith despite setback at @entity41
displaced jockey @entity68 claimed @entity6 was not same horse
@entity6 becomes the first back to back winner of the race since 1978
@entity105 came in second with @entity18 in third and @entity20 fourth
