red hearts , red roses , red kisses - they 're the three symbols that spell romance			2
with @entity6 just around the corner , it 's time to inject a little passion into your life , and while i ca n't advise on hearts and flowers , i can definitely give you a helping hand when it comes to creating the perfect scarlet pout			1
this week i 've selected my top five red lipsticks and come up with a few tips on choosing your ideal shade			0
here she shows you the secret behind five classic looks			1
pictured : @entity22 wears the starter red - @entity32 in @entity34 the starter red if you 're a little bit scared by full - blown scarlet , a good place to start is with a subtle shade of pinky red			1
these softer , magenta hues are less dominating than a bold blood red and they flatter all skin tones			0
my favourite is @entity32 in @entity34 , a satin formula that glides on beautifully straight from the bullet and colours your lips in a warm , glistening sunset shade			0
long - wearing and wonderfully moisturising , this is a great everyday red			0
the fashion red right now , it 's bang on trend to pair bright red lips with understated eyes and cheeks - you 'll see all the celebs sporting this look			1
so a classic bright , fiery tone is a must for all fashion - conscious red - lipstick lovers			1
for a fashion red , opt for bright fiery tones using a shade called romance from the @entity71 range my favourite is a shade called romance from my own @entity76 range ( above left )			0
okay , i may be a little biased , but i 've tried and tested hundreds of reds and this one really is incredibly flattering - working equally well against pale , creamy complexions and golden tanned skins			0
@entity81 are all also enriched with vitamin e , which leaves your lips feeling super-soft and moisturised - and just waiting to be kissed ! the @entity85 red when it comes to red lips for a glamorous night out or a romantic date , the shade to go for is a deep , dark , sultry scarlet			1
i 've chosen another lipstick from my @entity71 range , this time in a shade called @entity94			0
for the femme fatale look , @entity22 says to go for a deeper scarlet , like this @entity94 shade from her @entity71 range these rich , ruby reds look passionate , dramatic and sensual - they really make a statement			1
thanks to its rich , hydrating formula , you can apply this lipstick straight from the bullet , but when i 'm wearing a strong shade and want to create the perfect finish , i prefer to apply my red lippy with a lip brush to create a really polished , professional finish			2
the day to night red bold , tomato red is a real go - anywhere colour			2
elegant and feminine by day ; playful and vampy by night , it 's a true cosmetics classic - the little black dress in lipstick form ! @entity117 in @entity118 is a vivid , vibrant shade , with a luscious , moisture - rich formula that gives it great staying power - exactly what you want for your a 24 - hour pout			1
pair this colour with another classic look - the cat 's - eye eyeliner flick - and whatever time your @entity26 calls round , you 'll be feeling irresistible			2
a vivid and vibrant shade can go from day to night in an instant , using a lipstick like @entity117 in @entity118 the @entity133 red if you 're after a dazzling pillar box shade - a real showstopper - then look no further than @entity136 in @entity137			1
a gorgeous red - carpet red , this lipstick makes a perfect accompaniment to glam smoky eyes			0
plus the silky @entity143 formula will keep your lips feeling smooth and wo n't dry out or bleed throughout the evening			0
the @entity133 red is the most classic of all and suits most skin tones ( pictured : @entity136 in @entity137 ) best of all , the cool tones in this red will make your teeth look whiter , giving you a real @entity133 smile			1
lots of love ( hopefully ) @entity155 @entity156 as well as being the month of romance , february is also @entity159 ’s @entity158			0
to help raise money to fund life saving heart research , i ’m getting involved with their @entity165 day today – you can too , by getting sponsored to wear something red – or simply a red lippy ! for more info on this worthwhile cause visit bhf.org.uk / red .			2
