it ’s already possible to use your smartphone in place of a wallet , and now it seems @entity6 wants your @entity7 to replace your car keys			1
a patent granted this week hints that @entity6 is working on technology that would allow a driver to use their @entity7 or possibly an @entity6 watch to access their car			1
it would use a @entity18 connection and an access code to unlock a vehicle			1
a patent granted this week hints that @entity6 is working on technology that would allow a driver to use their @entity7 or possibly @entity6 watch to access their car ( shown in this illustration ) the @entity26 patent relates to ‘ a primary portable device [ that ] can access a vehicle by transmitting an activation message including a vehicle access credential to the vehicle			1
’ this means that drivers could use their iphone to unlock their car , as well as starting the engine			2
the patent suggests that one device – an iphone for example – could pass a digital key onto another gadget – perhaps another @entity7 or the @entity41 , and this could be used to unlock a car			1
other firms are also working on devices and apps with which to unlock cars			2
for example , @entity48 lets drivers of certain cars lock and unlock them using their smartphone and a software firm called @entity54 has created an experimental app that could let @entity57 drivers control their car 's functions from the @entity41 ( shown ) @entity60 launched last year in the @entity26 and lets people with an @entity7 6 and 6 plus pay for goods by tapping their handsets on @entity66 readers , in lieu of a wallet			1
it works by holding the phone up to a card reader and pressing a finger on the @entity74 button			0
this confirms the person 's identity , and the payment is made as if the user had presented and signed their card			0
all details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely			0
if an @entity7 is lost , users can suspend all payments via the find my @entity7 service			2
@entity60 is currently available in more than 220,000 shops , and 17 banks , in the @entity26			0
@entity91 has already said it is working with @entity6 to bring the service to the @entity93 this year			0
@entity6 already owns a similar patent that could allow drivers to unlock their vehicle using their @entity7 with an ‘ accessory control , ’ @entity94 reported			1
while many ideas in patents never make it into final products , the race is on to give drivers access to their cars with mobile handsets			0
for example , @entity48 lets drivers of certain cars lock and unlock them using their smartphone			2
@entity110 has also launched an @entity112 watch that connects to its @entity114 system to start a car ’s engine or lock and unlock its doors			0
the gadget uses voice recognition to find lost cars in car parks too			0
software engineering company @entity54 has created an app to run on the @entity6 watch that would allow drivers of @entity57 ’s @entity125 to lock their car , turn on its headlights and show where it is parked			1
the firm , which has offices in @entity131 and in the @entity132 , made the app as an experiment and said it would work using web - service @entity135 .			0
