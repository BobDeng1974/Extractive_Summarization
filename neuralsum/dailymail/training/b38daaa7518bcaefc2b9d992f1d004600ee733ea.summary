by @entity0 published : 22:06 est , 1 october 2013 updated : 03:02 est , 2 october 2013 out : @entity1 stepped down as ceo of @entity3 in 2000 and now some investors want him out as chairman of the board three of the top 20 investors in @entity3 are lobbying the board to press for @entity1 to step down as chairman of the software company he co-founded 38 years ago , according to people familiar with matter			1
while @entity3 chief executive @entity14 has been under pressure for years to improve the company 's performance and share price , this appears to be the first time that major shareholders are taking aim at @entity1 , who remains one of the most respected and influential figures in technology			1
a representative for @entity3 declined to comment on tuesday			2
there is no indication that @entity3 's board would heed the wishes of the three investors , who collectively hold more than 5 percent of the company 's stock , according to the sources			1
they requested the identity of the investors be kept anonymous because the discussions were private			0
@entity1 owns about 4.5 percent of the $ 277 billion company and is its largest individual shareholder			1
the three investors are concerned that @entity1 ' role as chairman effectively blocks the adoption of new strategies and would limit the power of a new chief executive to make substantial changes			2
in particular , they point to @entity1 ' role on the special committee searching for @entity14 's successor			2
@entity3 is currently in transition , as it searches for a replacement for ceo @entity14			1
@entity14 has focused on improving sales of mobile phones and other devices they are also worried that @entity1 - who spends most of his time on his philanthropic foundation - wields power out of proportion to his declining shareholding			1
gates , who owned 49 percent of @entity3 before it went public in 1986 , sells about 80 million @entity3 shares a year under a pre-set plan , which if continued would leave him with no financial stake in the company by 2018			1
he lowered his profile at @entity3 after he handed the ceo role to @entity14 in 2000 , giving up his day - to - day work there in 2008 to focus on the $ 38 billion @entity72			1
in august , @entity14 said he would retire within 12 months , amid pressure from activist fund manager @entity74			0
@entity3 is now looking for a new ceo , though its board has said @entity14 's strategy will go forward			2
he has focused on making devices , such as the surface tablet and @entity81 gaming console , and turning key software into services provided over the @entity84			0
some investors say that a new chief should not be bound by that strategy			0
gates , seen here in 2002 , has been a driving force behind @entity3 since he founded it with @entity91 in 1975 news that some investors were pushing for @entity1 ' ouster as chairman provoked mixed reactions from other shareholders			1
' this is long overdue , ' said @entity99 , a portfolio manager at @entity100 , which owns @entity3 shares			0
' replacing the old guard with some fresh eyes can provide the oxygen needed to properly evaluate their corporate strategy			0
' @entity107 , senior analyst at @entity108 , suggested now was not the time for @entity3 to ditch @entity1 , and that he could even play a larger role			1
' i 've thought that the company has been missing a technology visionary , ' she said			0
' @entity1 ( @entity1 ) would fit the bill			0
' @entity3 is still one of the world 's most valuable technology companies , making a net profit of $ 22 billion last fiscal year			0
but its core @entity119 computing operating system , and to a lesser extent the office software suite , are under pressure from the decline in personal computers as smartphones and tablets grow more popular			0
shares of @entity3 have been essentially static for a decade , and the company has lost ground to @entity131 and @entity132 in the move toward mobile computing			2
one of the sources said @entity1 was one of the technology industry 's greatest pioneers , but the investors felt he was more effective as chief executive than as chairman .			0

activist shareholders own *5percent* of the company
@entity1 founded @entity3 38 years ago , but stepped down as ceo in 2000
