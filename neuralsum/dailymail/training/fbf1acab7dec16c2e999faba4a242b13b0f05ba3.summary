need for ' proportionate scheme ' : master of the @entity3 , @entity1 , has ruled that the law which requires people to disclose all previous convictions to employers breaches human rights people who have been given police cautions for theft will be free to work in care homes , schools and hospitals despite their criminal past , under a human rights ruling			1
currently , anybody applying to work with children or vulnerable adults must disclose any convictions or cautions they hold			2
the @entity23 checks are designed to weed out applicants who could abuse positions of trust			1
but in a bombshell ruling yesterday the @entity27 said the system was a breach of @entity31 of @entity33 ’s @entity32 , the right to privacy			2
and it applies whether the caution was received many years ago as a child or recently as an adult			2
judges found in favour of a woman who was blocked from taking a job in a care home eight years after she received a police caution for theft from a shop in @entity48 while in her early 40s			1
the @entity49 , @entity1 , said the decision to bar her from the job had breached her human rights			1
he ruled that ‘ requiring the disclosure of all convictions and cautions relating to recordable offences is disproportionate ’			1
her identity was kept secret			0
the judges in the @entity59 ( above ) said the @entity23 system is a breach of @entity31 of the @entity62 , the right to privacy the case was brought to the @entity59 after campaign group @entity66 intervened in the case of ' t ' , a 21 - year - old man who received warnings from @entity70 when he was 11 years old in connection with two stolen bikes			1
the information was disclosed on two occasions : when he applied for a part - time job at a local football club at the age of 17 and later when he applied for a university course in sports studies			0
@entity81 , the solicitor who represented ' t ' , told @entity82 : ' this is a case where human rights equals common sense			1
' you ca n’t argue that something you did when you were 11 years old will blight you for the rest of your life			0
' the ruling means employers could , in future , be barred from knowing whether a potential employee has a theft conviction			0
it raises the prospect of people who have admitted serious dishonesty looking after care home residents , some with dementia			0
last year , 38,400 cautions were given out for theft , all of which could now remain secret			0
the verdict also included the case of a 17 - year - old who failed to get a job at a sports club because he had to disclose a police warning he had received for bicycle theft when he was 11			0
had the @entity27 ruled only that cautions given for minor crimes to juveniles should no longer be included in @entity23 checks , there would have been little fuss			1
but because the judgment found in favour of an adult it provoked anger at @entity124			0
@entity126 mp @entity125 said : ‘ this is another classic example of judicial legislation under the @entity32 – stretching human rights , and eroding the ability of those in positions of trust to protect the vulnerable			1
this balance should be decided by accountable law - makers			0
’ a government spokesman said : ‘ the protection of children and vulnerable groups must not be compromised			1
we are disappointed by this judgment and are seeking leave to appeal to the @entity144			0
’ while ruling that the current system of @entity23 checks must be ripped - up , the judges did not specify exactly how ministers must change the law to make it human rights compatible			1
@entity1 said only that a system of ‘ filtering ’ was required , to allow for irrelevant criminal records to be removed			0
it leaves ministers with a big headache			0
one option is to say that all cautions will be excluded from enhanced @entity23 checks			1
but this could have huge ramifications – 212,000 criminals were punished in this way last year alone , many for serious offences			0
the only certain outcome is that , because judges have ruled on the specific case of the woman in her 40s , it will no longer be lawful to insist a caution for theft must automatically be disclosed			1
the ruling could mean hundreds of thousands of people who have been made to disclose past convictions to employers seeking compensation , if they missed out on the job			0
criminal record checks were beefed up after the case of @entity180 , who was jailed for life in 2003 for the murder of @entity183 and @entity183 in @entity184 , @entity185			2
he had got a job as a school caretaker because his criminal links had not been shared by @entity190			0
the ruling will raise fears that more relaxed checks on previous convictions will allow criminals to work in sensitive jobs such as at care homes			2
the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) was established under the @entity198 1997 and launched in march 2002 following public concern about the safety of children , young people and vulnerable adults			1
it also aimed to reduce the risk of organisations being sued for employing convicted criminals who went on to abuse in the course of their duty			2
changing rules : criminal records checks were toughened up following the murders of @entity183 and @entity183 ( both left ) by @entity180 ( right ) in 2002 , but are now being relaxed by the @entity214 government vetting was strengthened further with the introduction of the @entity217 ( @entity217 ) , which required all people working with vulnerable people and young children be checked			1
the @entity217 came into force in direct response to recommendations by the @entity224 following the murders of @entity183 and @entity183 by @entity180 in 2002			0
@entity180 had been suspected of a string of offences including rape , indecent assault and burglary			0
his only conviction before the murders was for riding an uninsured and unlicensed motorcycle , although a burglary charge had remained on file			0
however , there was debate whether he would have been caught if the rules had been in place at the time of his horrific crime			2
last year , the government announced that millions of people who volunteer to help in schools , with sport or at charity events are to be freed from the red tape of criminal record checks			1
ministers are scaling back legislation to exempt more than half of the nine million who have needed to go through @entity33 ’s ' vetting and barring scheme ' from the need to be officially checked			2
on december 1 , 2012 , the @entity23 and the @entity217 were merged to form the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) .			1

judges say disclosure of some crimes not compatible with human rights
@entity23 checks used to weed applicants who could abuse position of trust
