by @entity0 a defendant turned away from court for wearing shorts during this week 's sweltering temperatures stunned magistrates by strolling back for his hearing dressed in a blouse and skirt			1
@entity9 , 47 , was told by ushers at @entity11 his summer attire of shorts and a vest top were not appropriate clothing and was turned away from the building			1
but disgruntled mr @entity9 , who was due to face magistrates for a minor criminal damage charge , reappeared at court soon after in a red floral skirt and light - coloured silk blouse			1
skirting the law : @entity9 - @entity9 donned a floral skirt and blouse in court after being told by ushers his shorts and vest top were not ' appropriate clothing ' and after returning 30 minutes later in a full set of ladies clothes from a charity shop , court staff did not bat an eye - lid at his new ensemble and his case went ahead as normal			1
mr @entity9 had been due before magistrates on a criminal damage charge after admitting urinating on his ex-girlfriend 's £ 48 dog basket			2
speaking after the case , in which magistrates made no reference to his cross-dressing , @entity9 , from @entity45 , said he was not happy that he could not wear shorts and his vest top			1
he said : ' i am not allowed to wear shorts even though it ’s one of the hottest summer days			0
' there were loads of women walking around with vest tops on inside the court - so i thought i ’d be ok			2
' i had to go to a charity shop to get these clothes and i shall now be making a complaint			0
' ' when i returned i got a few funny looks but they could n’t stop me from wearing it - and i was allowed into court			1
' it ’s ridiculous that it came to that in order for me to get my case heard			0

' ' the other people there thought it was quite amusing - after they found out i was n’t a transvestite			0
' even one of the solicitors seemed to see the funny side			1
' @entity9 , from @entity45 , was also charged with criminal damage to his ex-girlfriend ’s flat - screen television			1
he had denied damaging the television set which cost £ 583.80 - but admitted damaging the £ 48 dog basket owned by his ex , @entity85 , by urinating on it			0
@entity9 was acquitted of the damage to the tv as it could not be proved that the television had been damaged by the defendant as there had been no witnesses			2
chairwoman of the bench , mrs @entity94 said his actions were of a ' disgusting nature ' and had a domestic violence nature to them			0
@entity9 is to have a probation report compiled and will reappear in court on june 20			2
he was released on conditional bail			0
after the case a court spokesman said : ' people attending court are expected to dress in a manner that will respect the dignity of the court			0
