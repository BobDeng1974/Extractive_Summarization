astronomers around the world are tracking with eager anticipation the arrival of a comet next year which could even outshine our @entity5 in the night sky			1
@entity8 is expected to draw millions into the dark to witness what is likely to be the most brilliant comet seen in many generations			1
it is visiting the inner solar system for what is thought to be the first time and is set to put on spectacular views for the @entity18 across november and december as it heads towards the sun. look to the skies next year : @entity8 could produce a spectacular show when it flies by next year - similar to the 1997 appearance of @entity24 ( pictured ) how @entity24 looked above @entity25 : next year 's comet is predicted to be even more spectacular , and remain in the skies for weeks it may prove to be brighter than any comet of the last century - visible even in daylight - and this may end up being its one and only trip to the solar system , as its trajectory may see it plunge into the sun in a fiery death			1
it is currently moving inwards from beyond @entity40 , and as it approaches the @entity41 , the ' dirty snowball ' could produce a dazzling display , burning brighter than the moon and potentially being visible in broad daylight			1
astronomer dr @entity45 , writing in @entity47 , says the comet will be visible to the naked eye in the night sky by late november			1
spotted in space : two astronomers from @entity53 discovered the icy ball , pictured here dimly lit against background stars ' its tail could stretch like a searchlight into the sky above the horizon , ' dr @entity45 writes			1
' then it will swing rapidly around the @entity63 , passing within two million miles of it , far closer than any planet ever does , to emerge visible in the evening sky heading northward towards the pole star			1
' it could be an " unaided eye " object for months			2
when it is close in its approach to the @entity63 it could become intensely brilliant but at that stage it would be difficult and dangerous to see without special instrumentation as it would be only a degree from the sun. ' the comet , which was discovered by astronomers using the @entity80 ( @entity80 ) telescope in @entity53 , will pass within two million miles of the sun 's surface - making it a ' sun - grazing ' comet			1
it is on a ' parabolic ' orbit , which means it probably originated from the outer skirts of the solar system , perhaps from the @entity90 - a mass of icy debris which lies 50,000 times further from the sun than the @entity41 does			2
if comet @entity80 survives the encounter , it could take thousands - potentially millions - of years before the comet passes back through the inner solar system			1
@entity24 sailed overhead , leaving two trails : an ionic trail of magnetically - charged particles facing directly away from the sun ( left ) , and a trail of dust and debris ( right ) comets are dusty balls of ice , which generally originate from the @entity111 belt - a region of icy small bodies beyond @entity114			0
occasionally , a comet gets dislodged from its orbit , and plunges in to the inner solar system			0
they differ from asteroids , which are made of metal or rock , and are usually the left over remnants of planets or moons			0
comets are not really reflective - they only reflect 4 per cent of the the @entity63 's rays , about the same as coal			2
so although they look brilliantly white from @entity41 , they are black at the surface			0
@entity132 's comet is the most well - known , named after @entity133 who noted the regular 75 - 76 - year appearance of a comet , and predicted it would return in 1758 , although sadly the astronomer died 16 years before he was proved correct			0
@entity132 's comet has passed within a fraction of the @entity41 before - in 1910 the @entity41 even moved through the comet 's tail			0
sadly , the 1986 re-appearance was the worst for 2,000 years , as the @entity41 and the comet were on opposite sides of the sun. the comet will begin brightening once it gets within @entity40 's orbit , as the sun 's heat begins boiling the ice locked within the comet , converting it directly into gas			0
it is likely to recall the excitement of @entity24 , which sailed past the @entity41 in 1997 , appearing as a static - looking smear in the skies across the @entity18			0
it is also set to outshine ' the greatest comet of the last century ' - @entity160 , which shone brighter than @entity161 as it passed above the southern hemisphere in 1965			1
comets are known as ' dirty snowballs ' , although technically a better definition would be ' snowy dirtballs ' , as comets are generally rocky at the surface , with chemical - laden ice within the interior			0
as the ice and chemicals heat up , they erupt as brilliant jets which can form tails lasting hundreds of thousands of kilometres in length			0
the comet is expected to be bright throughout late november and early december			2
@entity178 , vice-president of the @entity179 , said : ' this is a very exciting discovery			0
' the comet looks like it could become a very spectacular sight in the evening sky after sunset from the @entity185 in late november and early december next year			2
' our members will be eagerly following it as it makes its first trip around the @entity63 and hoping to see it shining brilliantly and displaying a magnificent tail as it releases powerful jets of gas and dust			2

@entity8 to be visible to the naked eye by november 2013 in the @entity198
it could be brighter than any comet of the past century and may even be visible in daylight
discovered by @entity53 astronomers , @entity80 is thought to originate from the @entity90 and may end up *crashing* into the @entity63
