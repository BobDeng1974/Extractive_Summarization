earlier this week @entity0 removed her entire back catalog from music streaming service @entity2 , and now the singer has explained why			1
the decision came at the same time she was promoting new album 1989 , which sold 1.287 copies in its first week , just shy of @entity9 ' record for the biggest - ever album weekly sales by a female artist ( 1.319million )			1
' if i had streamed the new album , it ’s impossible to try to speculate what would have happened , ' @entity0 told @entity16 of leaving @entity2			2
and i ’m not willing to contribute my life ’s work to an experiment that i do n’t feel fairly compensates the writers , producers , artists , and creators of this music			2
' the 24 - year - old added : ' and i just do n’t agree with perpetuating the perception that music has no value and should be free			1
' @entity0 referenced the piece she wrote for the @entity45 in july in which she expressed that she does not believe music should be free , and in her interview with @entity16 went on : ' i try to stay really open - minded about things , because i do think it ’s important to be a part of progress			2
' but i think it ’s really still up for debate whether this is actual progress , or whether this is taking the word “ music ” out of the music industry			0
' @entity0 's current single shake it off was among the songs she removed , and had been the most streamed track on the service in the @entity64 , the @entity65 and globally			1
and she explained she was keen on giving the service a try , but that it just did n't work out			2
@entity0 told @entity16 : ' a lot of people were suggesting to me that i try putting new music on @entity2 with @entity72 , and so i was open - minded about it			1
big decision : the singer , seen here performing on @entity75 last week removed her entire back catalog from the popular music - streaming service - just as her record label boss is attempting to sell his business ' i thought , " i will try this ; i ’ll see how it feels			1
" it did n’t feel right to me			0
i felt like i was saying to my fans , " if you create music someday , if you create a painting someday , someone can just walk into a museum , take it off the wall , rip off a corner off it , and it ’s theirs now and they do n’t have to pay for it			2
" @entity0 added : ' i did n’t like the perception that it was putting forth			0
and so i decided to change the way i was doing things			0
' in a statement posted on @entity2 ’s website after her music was removed , the company said it was trying to get the hit - maker to change her mind			1
‘ we love @entity0 , and our more than 40 million users love her even more – nearly 16 million of them have played her songs in the last 30 days , and she ’s on over 19 million playlists			0
‘ we hope she ’ll change her mind and join us in building a new music economy that works for everyone			0
' we believe fans should be able to listen to music wherever and whenever they want , and that artists have an absolute right to be paid for their work and protected from piracy			2
that ’s why we pay nearly 70 percent of our revenue back to the music community			0
' @entity122 hit success : the decision came at the same time she was promoting new album 1989 , which sold 1.287 copies in its first week , just shy of @entity9 ' record for the biggest - ever album weekly sales by a female artist ( 1.319million ) it has been suggested the decision may have been instigated by @entity0 's record label , reports @entity135			1
@entity136 is up for sale and a source said the decision to leave @entity2 was aimed at driving up the sales price			1
' @entity136 is in the process of selling itself , and that ca n't be forgotten here			0
[ they 're looking to ] increase the multiple for the sale of that company			0
[ @entity148 ] @entity147 is a very old - school thinker			0
he 's wrong , ' said the source			0
it is n't unusual for major artists to wait a while before releasing new material to the streaming service - @entity157 , @entity151 and @entity152 have all withheld their latest albums in a bid to encourage greater first week physical sales			1
@entity0 's last album , @entity163 , did n't make it onto @entity2 until eight months after it was first launched			1
