they were the biggest of the @entity2 giants , roaming the frozen plains of the @entity4			0
but it seems the final days of the woolly mammoth were a sad struggle for survival			0
genetic analysis of two woolly mammoth remains show that their population became so small that they had become chronically inbred			2
the study has also raised the prospect of bringing the giant mammal back to life using cloning techniques with modern elephants			1
scientists claim to have taken a major step towards recreating the woolly mammoth by inserting more than a dozen of the creature 's genes into the live dna of an elephant			2
researchers studied the structure of @entity38 from mammoths preserved in the @entity18 to reproduce exact copies of 14 of the extinct animal ’s genes			1
these were then integrated by experts at @entity47 in @entity48 into the elephant genome - and functioned as normal dna			0
a new method known as ' @entity51 ' - helping scientists make accurate changes to @entity38 - was used by genetics professor @entity54 , who replaced parts of elephant dna with the mammoth genes other researchers have proposed using mammoth dna to replace that of an elephant using a similar technique to the one used to clone @entity60			2
however , many scientists fear these animals would be unable to survive in the modern world without their ancient habitat			0
such techniques also can lead to deformities and health problems in the animals			0
however the researchers behind the genetic analysis have urged other scientists not to attempt this for fear of the suffering it may cause to the animals			0
instead , they say their findings have revealed new insights into the evolutionary history and demise of the woolly mammoths			0
they have published full dna sequences of one mammoth found in @entity84 , northeast @entity85 – thought to be around 45,000 years old – and another from one of the last surviving mammoths found on @entity88 , north of @entity89 in the @entity90			1
they found that the mammoths on @entity88 had been isolated for at least 5,000 years , eking out a meager existence there before dying out 4,500 years ago			1
analysis showed that the parents of the mammoth found on @entity88 had been distant relatives , suggesting the population had been inbreeding			1
dr @entity98 , an associate professor of bioinformatics and genetics at the @entity100 who took part in the study , said : ‘ we found that the genome from one of the world ’s last mammoths displayed low genetic variation and a signature consistent with inbreeding			2
‘ this is likely due to the small number of mammoths that managed to survive on @entity88 during the last 5,000 years of the species ’ existence			1
’ the researchers , whose work is published in the journal @entity118 , found that the mammoth genome only appeared to align with african elephant dna by between 64 per cent and 76 per cent			1
researchers extracted dna from the remains of two woolly mammoths who died 36,000 years apart scientists have been able to extract @entity38 from mammoth hair ( above ) and tusks found across @entity85 mammoths are thought to have evolved around 400,000 years ago in eastern @entity129 and is a close relative to the @entity129 elephant			1
the researchers analysis revealed that mammoths appear to have suffered significant setbacks around 250,000 to 300,000 years ago where their population was decimated			1
however , they then recovered before they experienced a further hit to their populations around 116,000 to 130,000 years ago			1
the population then appears to have remained stable until 12,000 years ago when their numbers were drastically reduced			2
the researchers believe the mammoths in @entity84 and @entity88 separated around 50,000 years			1
hunting by humans has long been thought to be what drove the mammoths to extinction while climate change has also been blamed			0
the researchers studied mammoth remains found at @entity84 in @entity85 and @entity88 ( shown above ) this mammoth tusk on @entity88 in @entity89 belonged to one of the last mammoths before they died out the new results suggest the animals were already in decline by the time humans began moving into @entity161 45,000 years ago			1
professor @entity162 , director of the @entity163 at @entity164 who was also involved in the research , said the @entity38 raises the prospect that mammoths could now be brought back from extinction			2
organisations like the @entity171 have said they hope to resurrect the mammoth			0
professor @entity162 said : ‘ this discovery means that recreating extinct species is a much more real possibility , one we could in theory realize within decades			0
‘ i think in the future it will be inevitable that we will be able to do it , but the bigger question is should we do it			0
‘ with a complete genome and this kind of data , we can now begin to understand what made a mammoth a mammoth — when compared to an elephant — and some of the underlying causes of their extinction which is an exceptionally difficult and complex puzzle to solve			0

the last mammoths died out on an @entity18 island around 4,500 years ago
isolated on @entity88 for around 5,000 years they became inbred
researchers found mammoth populations suffered declines in the past
dna sequencing also raises prospect of bringing mammoths back to life
