by @entity0 for @entity1 naked , drawn by a robot and painted in his own blood , a @entity3 artist may have just created the ultimate selfie			1
@entity8 's bizarre latest piece - titled ' @entity7 ( blood robot selfie ) ' - is exactly what it says on the tin			1
in order to bring it to life , mr @entity8 had to connect the robot artist to a vein in his arm , via a medical tube			1
' i 'm always trying to find the intersection between technology and existential human experience , ' he said			0
' i was trying to work out a way to program the machine to draw with a brush and ink when it occurred to me that i could hook myself up to the machine directly			2
modern art : mr @entity8 is used to creating unorthodox pieces , and focuses largely on the human form ' i 've never really been a huge fan of self portraits , and was not really into putting my nude self out there , but conceptually it made sense			1
' i wanted to show , in a poetic way , the connection we all have with technology and how it has permeated our inner selves in different ways			0
' much of mr @entity8 's artwork is quite gruesome and features the human form			2
one of his pieces , titled ' eve ' , is a circle of eight sculptures of a woman , starting out extremely thin and skeletal and ending up grotesquely fat			0
he also creates sculptures from crude oil and does paintings of abstract space scenes			2
his website bio reads : ' using figurative representation and geometric abstraction , @entity8 creates a narrative progression of forms that reveals something conceptually greater than the sum of their parts			1
' @entity8 ’s large scale works combine digital technology with highly crafted traditional sculpting methods to seamlessly produce conceptual objects that express the underlying analog truth within his subject matter			2
' his working process in an exploration into the human existential experience through imagined models of the universe as physical form			0
' mr @entity8 is not the only artist to recreate himself in blood			1
@entity94 member @entity93 has made a series of sculptures of his own head made from frozen blood			0
he makes a new version every five years for the project , titled ' @entity101 ' , with the first head being made from 4.5 litres of his own blood taken from him over five months			0
@entity104 bought the original in 1991 for a rumoured £ 13,000 , before selling it to an @entity108 collector for £ 1.5m in april 2005 .			0

@entity8 creates ultimate selfie drawn by a machine in his own blood
had to write thousands of lines of code to programme the robot
then sat for hours with it attached to a vein in his arm while it drew
