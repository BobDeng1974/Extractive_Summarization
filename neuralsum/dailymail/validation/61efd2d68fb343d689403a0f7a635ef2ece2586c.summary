a teenager has become the first cancer patient in @entity2 to have a metal port fitted to his head so doctors can blast drugs directly at his brain tumour			1
@entity8 , 17 , had the titanium socket - which was created by a 3d printer - bolted to his skull after traditional treatments failed to halt his aggressive brain tumour			1
a ' plug ' is screwed into the port which allows chemotherapy drugs to be pumped into the tumour along four hair - thin catheters with pinpoint accuracy			1
@entity8 has now become the first @entity2 cancer sufferer to have be fitted with a ' skull socket ' the 17 - year - old had the titanium socket - which was created by a 3d printer - bolted to his skull after traditional treatments failed to halt his aggressive brain tumour @entity8 is one of only three cancer sufferers in the world to receive the risky treatment , called ' convection - enhanced delivery ' ( @entity31 ) , which has not even reached stage one trials			1
' the first thing that i thought was that i was going to be like @entity36 , ' he said			0
' but i actually do n't really notice it			0
' i can feel it when they connect it but once it has connected it is fine			0
' when they screw it in i can here a scrapping noise inside my head			2
' @entity8 , of @entity48 , @entity49 , was diagnosed with @entity50 in january 2014 after complaining of migraines and stress			1
@entity8 underwent a 12 hour operation at @entity54 in @entity55 in february to remove the tennis - ball sized tumour , leaving him with short - term memory loss and restricted use of the left side of his body a ' plug ' is screwed into the port which allows chemotherapy drugs to be pumped into the tumour along four hair - thin catheters with pinpoint accuracy he underwent a 12 hour operation at @entity54 in @entity55 in february to remove the tennis - ball sized tumour , leaving him with short - term memory loss and restricted use of the left side of his body			1
although most of the tumour was cut out , it was attached to his thalamus in the centre of his brain and some could n't be removed safely			1
following the operation , he began oral chemotherapy , radiotherapy and was enrolled on a stage 2 drug test called @entity81 from a @entity83 pharmaceutical company			0
but none of the treatments worked and the tumour began to regrow , leaving the family with few choices			2
fortunately for the teen , he was then selected to take part in the @entity31 trials carried out by neurosurgeon professor @entity92 at @entity93			0
a 3d titanium port was fitted to @entity8 ' head at @entity96 , @entity97 , in late october with treatment beginning in november			1
he undergoes treatment for several hours over two days , after which he is discharged for six weeks before receiving another dose			0
the teen , pictured after the operation , is one of only three cancer sufferers in the world to receive the risky treatment , called ' convection - enhanced delivery ' ( @entity31 ) , which has not even reached stage one trials @entity8 ' father @entity110 does not blame the @entity111 for not funding the treatment @entity8 has now received three doses of the chemotherapy - classed as one ' cycle ' of treatment - and will have a scan at the end of march to reveal how he has responded			1
the concept has been around for nearly a decade but can be dangerous and so had never been used to treat cancer and or had even reached stage one trials			2
as a result the @entity111 would not provide funding and the £ 36,000 cost of @entity8 ' treatment so far has been privately donated			1
@entity8 's family has now set up the @entity128 , to help pay for his future treatment or that of others and have currently raised £ 8,000			2
his father @entity132 , 52 , said : ' his experience has given him a gift he can share - when you get through it , you 've got a unique story to inspire others			2
' ' he 's got a great sense of humour and everyone says he 's incredible , ' added his father , a salon owner			0
' he 's got strengths that i do n't know where they come from			0
' he 's teaching me all the time and his inner strength and spiritual calm have helped us all develop some qualities it takes a lifetime to learn			0
