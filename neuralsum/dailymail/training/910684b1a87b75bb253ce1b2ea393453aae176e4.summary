by @entity0 dozens of @entity4 babies are infected by a virus that has no cure , doctors say			1
professor @entity7 says 46 babies are currently infected with parechovirus , which has spread to @entity10			1
at least 11 cases have been confirmed in the state since december			2
' the outbreak is @entity4 - wide now and we believe there are at least four types of the virus , ' the @entity14 ( @entity15 ) laboratory director told reporters in @entity22			1
dozens of @entity4 babies have become infected with an incurable virus ' we do n't know what type is in @entity10 compared to other states			1
' @entity27 is a respiratory and intestinal disease that causes fever , irritability , rash and diarrhoea			1
severe cases can develop into hepatitis or encephalitis , and can also cause seizures			1
@entity15 associate professor @entity38 said the virus infected mainly infants , but no one was sure where it came from , how often it occurred or how to fight it			2
' this virus does not respond to common antibiotics , ' he said			1
but prof @entity38 said humans must have been able to fight it because it has been around for a long time - doctors just were not able to detect it			0
the @entity15 laboratory has recently developed a test to identify the virus in patients within a day			2
doctors say outbreaks have already occurred at two @entity22 hospitals , as well as other parts of the country ' it is important to diagnose the infection early and distinguish it from other possible causes , ' prof @entity38 said			0
the next natural step would be developing a vaccine , but he said until then the best way for parents to avoid parechovirus was good hygiene around babies			2
this included washing hands after going to the toilet , before eating , after wiping noses and after changing nappies			0
' it 's really common - sense stuff , ' prof @entity38 said			0
according to the @entity77 , the first case in @entity10 was reported in the northern city of @entity79			0
dr @entity80 from @entity22 's @entity81 told the publication they have already experienced outbreaks at two major @entity22 hospitals			0
' viruses overall are generally often milder infections than bacterial infections , but this one can be pretty nasty , ' she said			0
doctors are looking to develop a vaccine but there is not much known about the long - term effects of the virus			0
' but certainly when little babies contract the virus they are very sick when they present , ' dr @entity80 said			1
' there 's the risk of death and certainly long - term morbidity , with the possibility of significant brain damage			0
