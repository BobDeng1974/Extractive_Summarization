mr @entity0 tells 60 minutes that he can not come to grips with his son 's decisions , to run away from their @entity11 home and join @entity13 , a move which ultimately cost him his life , at age 18			1
' he was just a shy , lonely young man , ' he tells reporter @entity16			1
the teenager is believed to have converted to @entity18 in 2012 when he was in year 10 , shortly after his mother died of cancer			0

it was : ' @entity30 , i am very happy to be here '			0
' it 's going on , it 's real			0
' his revelations coming , as an islamic state propaganda website , geared towards celebrating the sacrifice made by the @entity11 teenage jihadi , did anything but glorify the actions of the 18 - year - old suicide bomber			1
the post , titled as the story of @entity59 – the name @entity0 adopted after he travelled to @entity6 to join @entity61 – gives the teenager some praise as a devout @entity64 who prays and fasts often			1
but the rant describes @entity0 as having ‘ a weak body ’ and having ' sold his soul for a cheap price ' , revealing how misguided his decisions were			2

@entity6 military official , general @entity83 , said no one was killed and just a few vehicles were damaged in @entity0 's suicide mission			1
the extremist site sought to praise @entity0 but delivers backhanded comments describing his weakness and ultimately the futility of his sacrifice			2
‘ he started fighting in @entity92 against the @entity93 and was a lion on the battlefield although he was at a young age and with a weak body , he was like a mountain , ’ the post , on a tumblr blog site associated with the @entity18 extremist group , said			0
it goes on to say that @entity0 volunteered for a ' martyrdom operation ' - code words for a suicide bombing - and that he was eager to carry out the mission			1
earlier social media posts suggested @entity0 had wanted to take part in a suicide bombing in @entity92 in @entity6 , but that he pulled out of this mission because he got cold feet			1
instead he fought in the city before again signing up for martrydom and being sent to @entity73 in @entity6			0
the post said @entity0 was ' full of happiness as he was finally going to meet his lord and receive the great rewards promised by @entity117			2
' but it goes on to mock his sacrifice			0
' this brother originated from an atheist family & ended up selling his soul to @entity124 for a cheap price , ' the post says			0
@entity35 ( pictured , left ) in a school photo from year 10 - the year he converted to @entity18 according to school friends , and another image of him wearing a @entity130 shirt ( pictured right ) an image of @entity0 sitting in front of an islamic state flag was posted to @entity134 , ahead of his suicide mission in @entity6 , which authorities labelled ' a failure ' the post said that during his time in @entity73 , @entity0 was very devout ' known for his worship of @entity124 ' and would fast every other day			1
it said @entity0 accepted @entity18 three years ago ‘ even though his parents basically went to war with him at home tried to stop him from reverting ’			2
' happy - slapped ' : @entity35 was bullied while at high school in @entity148 in @entity11 's north , and video emerged of the incident ahead of his suicide mission for @entity13 the bullying tactic sees a group of people slap their victim and film it on a camera phone before uploading it on - line in order to humiliate them			1
here @entity35 is ' happy slapped ' while at school the former @entity148 student , converted to @entity18 in 2012 when he was in @entity163			0
a video later surfaced from his school days which shows @entity0 being ' happy slapped ' - a bullying tactic which sees a group of people slap their victim , film it and upload it on - line to humiliate them			2
in december , @entity0 reached @entity73 , a city located in central @entity6 , and said he ' made hijra ( or departed ) ’ in august			2
he was considered a well - educated maths genius , who dreamed of one day becoming a political journalist and even founded a children ’s soccer charity but by the time he ’d reached his 18th birthday @entity35 ’s mind had been warped			0
if you believe his tale of events - detailed in an articulate blog called from @entity11 to @entity73 : my @entity187 joined @entity13 fighters in @entity6 after years of historical research and a final realisation that ' i was growing tired of the corruption and filthiness of @entity46 society and yearned to live under the @entity13 with the @entity64 '			1
however , the picture @entity0 paints of himself – a scholar and a rational thinker – is very different to the lonely outcast that his former classmates at @entity148 have described			2
‘ at school he was a " loner "			0
he only really had two or three friends from memory but they were n't the type of friends that if he was in need of some help were good at helping , ’ a former classmate told @entity202			0
‘ he was obviously a kid that needed some help or guidance and he thought converting to @entity18 was right for him , ’ they opined			0
another classmate , after hearing that @entity0 may be dead , described him as not ' capable of punching his way out of a wet paper bag			0
' the kid ( was ) angry at the world and wants to take it out on innocent people			0
