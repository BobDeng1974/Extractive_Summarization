but this was @entity11 , @entity12 , and the last thing @entity14 expected to see when she leant out of her window for a cigarette was a bright green reptile crawling up towards her			1
it had escaped after her neighbour of several floors down left the window open			1
bizarre : this was the astonishing site that greeted @entity12 woman @entity14 , 38 , when she opened the window of her 16th floor flat to have a cigarette - and spotted this scaled lizard stuck to the wall outside firefighters clamber out with nets to try to recapture the errant iguana			1
it 's owner had not called authorities after his pet escaped because he had n't registered it and so was keeping it in his home illegally ' it seemed to be able to walk up the wall like it had glue on its feet , ' said ms @entity14 , 38			2
