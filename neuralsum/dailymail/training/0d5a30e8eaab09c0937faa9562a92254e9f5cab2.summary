sources close to the electronics giant say the handset , expected to be a speed - boosted version of the current @entity2 with new software , will begin production within weeks and go on sale in the summer			1
this will break with @entity3 's traditional autumn unveiling of a new handset , and is likely to pave the way for a lower cost iphone to be revealed later in the year			1
customers queue up to purchase the @entity2 smartphone at the @entity3 flagship store on @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22			2
the firm is believed to be preparing to unveil the next version in the summer			0
@entity3 's next two @entity26 had already been designed before @entity27 died in october 2011 , it has been claimed			1
at a meeting with the @entity31 district attorney , @entity30 , who is keen to cut phone thefts in the region , @entity3 's liaison officer @entity28 is reported by the @entity34 to have said the designs for the next two phones ' preceded @entity37 [ being chief executive ] '			1
the new model is believed to look identical to the current @entity2 but include a faster processor and updated camera , according to online reports			0
it will also run @entity44 7 , a major new version of @entity3 's @entity46 and @entity2 software being overseen by @entity3 's sir @entity47			1
' @entity3 plans to begin production of a refreshed @entity2 similar in size and shape to its current one in the second quarter of the year , according to people familiar with the device 's production , teeing up a possible summer launch for the next version of its flagship device , ' claims the @entity59			1
' at the same time , @entity3 continues to work with its manufacturing partners in @entity61 on a less expensive @entity2 that could be launched as soon as the second half of this year , these people said			0
' the report is in line with the expectations of company watchers and @entity68 analysts			0
the @entity2 costs around $ 600 in the @entity70 , and while @entity3 maintains older iphones in production , even those are n't cheap enough to compete effectively against low - end smartphones running @entity76 's @entity75 software			1
@entity3 does not comment on future products before its launch events			0
earlier this year it was claimed the @entity79 will be revealed in april and go on sale in august			0
it also claims that new @entity46 models are set to be announced in april , including a new version of the firm 's hugely successful @entity83 with an upgraded screen			2
already obsolete ? two models display the @entity2 during the product 's release at a store in @entity90 on december 14			0
an analyst has claimed production of the next @entity2 will begin in march for a summer launch ' @entity95 has learned that @entity3 is planning the release of the @entity79 for this summer , currently for august , ' the site said			1
' next generation @entity46 , presumably the @entity46 5 and potentially the ipad mini 2 , may also debut as soon as this april , ' it added			0
' if these plans stick , we should be in for a fun spring and summer			0
' it comes as @entity104 @entity3 blog @entity102 reported that @entity105 is starting to ramp up production of @entity3 's @entity2 successor , according to @entity108			1
it claims that because the design of the ' @entity79 ' is substantially the same as the company 's existing handset , little to no tooling is needed to manufacture the two models on the same production lines			1
leaked photo ? this image purports to show the case of the new @entity79			0
published by @entity123 website @entity121 , the differences in internal attachment points suggest an update to the latest @entity3 phone the claims echo those made by @entity128 of investment bank @entity129 earlier this year , who said @entity3 will begin making a new @entity2 model in march for an expected launch in june or july			2
mr @entity128 predicted that @entity2 sales could begin to drop as customers anticipate the arrival of the next model , but he nonetheless said he expects around 44 million to ship in the quarter to march			0
' as word of the earlier production schedule starts to spread , we believe we could see a slight slowing of demand @entity142 in anticipation of the new product launch and @entity3 will likely start curtailing channel inventory , ' he was quoted as saying by @entity147			2
' therefore we tweak down our @entity149 shipment estimate from @entity150 to @entity151 , which is still well above widespread fears of shipments in the mid- @entity154			0
' the analyst 's prediction of a summer launch date for the @entity79 is a reiteration of claims he made last month , when he said he expects the new phone to ship in various colours and with improved battery life			2
on rumours of an entry - level @entity2 , mr @entity128 claimed @entity3 could release a low - cost device made of polycarbonate with no @entity167 ( @entity169 ) capability			2
the speculation seemed to contradict comments made by @entity172 , @entity3 's marketing chief , who recently told @entity174 newspaper the @entity175 that ' despite the popularity of cheap smartphones , this well never be the future of @entity3 's products			1
