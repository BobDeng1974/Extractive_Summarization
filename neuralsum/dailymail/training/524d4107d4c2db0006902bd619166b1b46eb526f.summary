’ @entity109 forecaster @entity108 said the upcoming warm weekend is ‘ a bit of a bonus for mid-september ’			2

’ @entity127 : ( left - to - right ) : @entity128 , 16 , @entity129 , 17 , @entity130 , 17 , @entity131 , 17 , and @entity132 , 16 , enjoy the last of the summer sun on @entity134 in the centre of @entity136 today splashing about : @entity137 , six , and his brother , @entity138 , three , cool off today in a water fountain in @entity136 however the warm temperatures over the weekend will be accompanied by single - figure lows overnight in some areas , and a fast turnaround into more normal september weather by next week			1

’ making the most of it : a man reads a book on @entity134 in @entity136 ( left ) today , while @entity166 , four , cools off in a water fountain in the city 's @entity168 posed up : under cloudless clear blue skies , the sun beats down on visitors to the @entity173 in @entity174 today , where they were enjoying the extended summer weather which is to last over the weekend hot and cold : the south of @entity178 will experience the best weather this weekend , although northern parts should also do well on saturday - while much of the country will experience showers by monday the warm weather is expected to spread across all of @entity5 on saturday , with the exception of north - west @entity120 , but by sunday it will be more confined to central and eastern parts			1
' it ’s well above average for this time of year			0
the best of the weather this weekend is going to be in the southern half of the @entity5 on saturday , but many eastern areas will also do ok ' @entity108 , @entity109 mr @entity108 told @entity112 : ‘ it could well feel a little more humid by sunday and it does bring the risk of the odd shower in south - west @entity178			1
at the moment most places will probably stay dry on sunday			2
’ tonight the weather is expected to stay generally cloudy across north - west @entity178 and western @entity120 , with further patchy light rain expected			1

on the up : ice cream prices have soared by more than 25 per cent over the past five years the demand for ice cream is slowly melting away as consumers are put off by high prices and switching to the more healthy option of frozen yoghurt , which is enjoying soaring sales			0
analysts say @entity5 will eat 27million fewer litres of ice cream this year than in 2007 , down 7 per cent , and spiralling prices mean the slide will continue over the next five years by another 7 per cent			1
retail experts @entity218 suggest total annual ice cream consumption will fall from 374million litres to 324million in the decade from 2007 , meaning we will eat at least 500million fewer scoops a year			2
@entity218 also reported that ice cream prices have soared by more than 25 per cent over the past five years as the prices of sugar and other raw materials have risen			0
higher manufacturing and transport costs have also had an impact , despite heavy advertising and promotion			0
@entity234 , @entity218 ’s senior food analyst , said : ‘ almost a fifth of consumers are cutting back because of financial or health reasons			2
together with the pressure on consumer incomes , this has gone some way to dampening demand			0

highs in @entity5 on saturday will be 27c ( 81f ) and 28c ( 82f ) on sunday
but temperatures will fall back to normal september levels by monday
@entity126 and southern parts expected to enjoy best weather this weekend
