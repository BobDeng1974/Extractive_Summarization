by @entity0 , political editor published : 19:09 est , 14 november 2012 updated : 02:40 est , 15 november 2012 @entity1 : family breakdown should be at the top of the agenda for tackling child poverty according to the @entity6 children whose parents have separated could be as impoverished as those in poor families , @entity1 will suggest today			1
in a radical move , the @entity6 will propose that family breakdown should be included in a new official measure of determining child poverty			1
little more than half of @entity17 children still live with both their birth parents by the time they are 15 , according to the latest @entity21 statistics			1
eight out of ten babies are born to couples living together , but that figure falls to only 55 per cent as they grow up			0
mr @entity1 will argue that family breakdown is a key indicator of children 's likelihood to succeed later in life and should be included in a new , broader measure of child poverty			1
this will prompt outrage from @entity34 , who are likely to accuse the government of deliberately changing the goalposts to mask the impact of its austerity policies and stigmatising children whose families have broken up			0
but mr @entity1 will insist that the last government 's strategy of spending more than £ 170billion in extra benefit payments for poor families comprehensively failed to address the issue			2
despite the huge increase in welfare spending , @entity46 failed to meet its aim of halving child poverty by 2010/11			1
its measure of poverty – 60 per cent of median earnings – was enshrined in law			0
but the @entity55 has agreed to tear up @entity46 's flagship measure – insisting that basing it purely on a crude assessment of family income is perverse , when other factors can determine children 's life chances			1
in a speech , mr @entity1 will suggest other factors in determining child poverty – including whether or not their parents are in work , educational failure , family breakdown , problem debt and poor health			1
work – not a few pounds extra in welfare handouts – is one of the main factors in lifting families out of poverty , he will argue			0
the @entity6 says the government 's universal credit , which will replace all out - of - work benefits from next year , will ensure the vast majority of children will be lifted out of poverty if at least one parent works 35 hours a week at the minimum wage , or 24 hours if they are a lone parent			1
mr @entity1 , speaking at the @entity87 in @entity88 , south - east @entity89 alongside @entity91 schools minister @entity90 , will say : ' it is widely understood that the current relative income measure by itself is not providing an accurate picture of child poverty			2
' a fixation on relative income , on moving people over an arbitrary line , does little to identify those most in need and entrenched in disadvantage , nor to transform their lives			0
' he said that a few extra pounds a week in benefits would not help families who were not only poor but also afflicted by ' worklessness , educational failure , family breakdown , problem debt and poor health '			2
' worse still , unless there is a meaningful , sustainable change in the lives of the recipients , they become more dependent , not less , resulting in poor social outcomes and deeper entrenchment			0
' entrenched in disadvantage ' : the @entity21 claims @entity46 's campaign to end child poverty was a failure ' we must learn the lessons of the previous decade , where despite @entity46 's best intentions and despite an unprecedented level of spending – £ 171billion on tax credits and a 60 per cent real increase in welfare bills , the government failed to reach their target to halve child poverty by 2010			1
' the " poverty plus a pound " approach failed because the root causes of poverty were left unchecked , and not enough was done to break the cycle of disadvantage			0
' no statistic will ever perfectly reflect what it means for a child to live in poverty			2
nevertheless , i believe it is possible to develop a better indicator than the current measure , one which does more to reflect vital childhood experiences : growing up in a stable family , seeing a parent go out to work , going to a good school			0
' mr @entity90 will add : ' the experience of child poverty is about more than whether their family income this week is low			1
' this consultation is not about abandoning the past			0
nor is it about massaging the figures			0
' it is instead about recognising the many dimensions of child poverty and concentrating policy on longer term solutions and not on short term fixes			2
' @entity46 set a target to reduce the number of children living in relative income poverty to 1.7million by 2010/11			1
this was not met , with 2.3million children living in relative income poverty in that year			0
however , in the @entity55 's first year there was a reduction of 300,000 children living in relative income poverty			2
ministers admit , however that this was not the result of incomes rising for the poorest , but was largely due to a significant drop in the median income , demonstrating the absurdity of the current measure .			0

family breakdown is a key indicator of children 's likelihood to succeed , says @entity6
little more than half of @entity17 children still live with both their birth parents by the time they are 15
@entity55 says @entity46 failed to meet its aim of halving child poverty by 2010/11
