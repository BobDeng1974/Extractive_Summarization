@entity0 chipped in with a cheeky assist as @entity2 beat @entity3 in the @entity4 thanks to a penalty shootout , but is still searching for his first goal in @entity7			1
the former @entity9 striker started the game in the centre of the attack but buzzed around the front in his usual waspish fashion , setting up the opener for @entity16			0
barely 15 minutes had passed when the ball reached @entity0 on the left - hand side of the box			2
he eyed up the target but instead of pulling the trigger , scooped the ball up to the back post where @entity16 had roamed forward , and the defender headed home			2
@entity0 twists and turns inside the area , before looking like he was about to shoot past the @entity3 goalkeeper but instead the @entity27 lofted a beautiful ball over the goalkeeper and defender @entity16 to run on to and score @entity16 heads home easily from inside the six - yard box to give @entity2 the lead early on , but they could n't hold it @entity2 : @entity36 , @entity37 ( @entity38 73 ) , @entity16 ( @entity39 46 ) , @entity40 , @entity41 ( @entity41 46 ) , @entity42 ( @entity43 75 ) , @entity44 ( @entity45 61 ) , @entity46 ( @entity47 61 ) , @entity48 , @entity0 ( @entity49 46 ) , @entity50 ( @entity51 46 )			1

penalty shoot - out : @entity2 scored : @entity45 , @entity43 , @entity38 , @entity47			1
@entity3 scored : @entity56 , @entity77			0
@entity3 missed : @entity66 , @entity61			2
@entity79 ’s side , a blend of first - teamers and youth players , were largely in control but a brilliant @entity66 free - kick pegged them back and in the end they had to rely on a spot - kick triumph			1
this was not the triumphant bounce - back rout they were hoping for after a humiliating defeat by @entity91 in @entity92 last weekend			0
the @entity4 has a long history , but this is the first time it has been contested in this format			2
usually there is a knock - out tournament including some of the smaller sides , but fixture congestion means that it has been converted into a one - off final between the two @entity102 sides from @entity103			0
in the eighth minute @entity0 should have scored his first @entity2 goal when the ball was cleverly crossed in to him near the penalty spot by @entity44			1
the @entity27 headed towards @entity108 ’s net , but could not generate enough power to beat the young goalkeeper , who still had to make a smart save			0
@entity0 turned his hand to creating instead , which he proved pretty good at on saturday in the @entity112			0
the forward turned in the area and dinked the ball up for @entity16 to nod into an empty net after 16 minutes			0
those two players turned in completely different performances during the 3 - 1 defeat by @entity91			0
@entity16 conceded a penalty , which was the nadir of a terrible display , while @entity0 was lively and did n't look like he 'd spent the previous four months frozen out of action			1
there were some concerns that adding another huge name to @entity2 's collection of attacking talent might not work , that @entity0 , @entity128 and @entity129 would be too selfish a front line			2
but @entity0 set up @entity129 's goal against @entity91 and also put one on a plate for @entity128 , who astonishingly missed			1
he drove into the box after 22 minutes but was blocked off as he tried to move towards goal , and also fired a free - kick over the bar as he searched for his first goal in a @entity2 first - team shirt			1
@entity0 had previously notched two in a friendly for @entity142 against @entity143			0
@entity37 had a low drive well fielded by @entity54 , the @entity146 starting in place of his rested compatriot @entity148 at right - back			0
@entity150 was on the bench and is clearly not in the good books of @entity153 manager @entity79			0
he did n't do much to help proceedings after being brought on at half - time and conceding a free - kick on the edge of the box			1
@entity66 - the player who @entity159 made cry last season while the defender played for @entity162 - stepped up and arrowed it into the top corner			2
@entity3 had created nothing at all prior to their goal , bar one chance on the 40 minute mark , when @entity58 broke free of @entity40 and @entity16			1
the defenders looked unsure of their positions but goalkeeper @entity172 acted with considerably more conviction , coming out of his goal to deny the striker			0
@entity16 ( left ) celebrates with @entity176 as @entity0 ( right ) comes to congratulate the @entity7 defender in @entity178 @entity0 now has two assists in two games for @entity2 , after making his debut against @entity91 on saturday @entity2 tried to get back in front and introduced @entity45 and @entity47 to patrol the midfield – and both ended up converting in the shootout			1
they nearly worked an opening for starlet @entity48 , but he fell short as he stretched to try and poke home from close range			0
the youngster started the season in sensational form but recently has fallen behind fellow youngster @entity193 , who looks a burlier and more physically adept presence as part of the forward line			0
the likelihood is now that both of them will be spending more time with the b team , as @entity0 beds in up top with @entity129 and @entity128			2
@entity172 earned his corn towards the end , with an excellent one - handed stop to prevent @entity3 netting a late winner , while at the other end @entity47 hit a drive which was milimetres wide of the top left corner , almost preventing penalties			1
and of @entity0 , who was taken off at half time ? his attention has already turned away from this game at @entity178 ’s minute @entity215 and to the @entity216 , where this coming saturday he hopes to finally open his @entity2 account against @entity218			1
@entity2 players celebrate winning the @entity220 at the @entity221 in @entity178 @entity45 lifts the @entity4 after the 4 - 2 penalty shootout victory over @entity3 on wednesday evening @entity0 celebrates after setting up @entity129 for @entity2 's first goal against @entity91 on saturday at the @entity224 @entity225 defeat part of the learning process - @entity79			1

@entity0 set up @entity16 to score with a **fantastic** , *unselfish* *lob* over the goalkeeper and defender
@entity3 *equalised* in the @entity4 in @entity178 through @entity66 , who struck a **fantastic** free - kick
the match went *straight* to penalties at full - time , with @entity47 scoring the winning penalty for @entity2
