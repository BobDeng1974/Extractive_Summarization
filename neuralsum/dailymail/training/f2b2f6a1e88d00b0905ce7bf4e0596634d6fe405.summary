by @entity0 published : 17:41 est , 31 december 2012 updated : 18:03 est , 31 december 2012 dedicated : prince @entity1 , pictured at sunday mass in @entity3 this week , has attended more @entity5 engagements this year than last despite his ill health he made his dedication to his role clear when he stood in the wind and rain for hours during the @entity11			1
and despite repeatedly battling ill health , the @entity1 carried out more official engagements over the past 12 months than he did the previous year			2
prince @entity1 , 91 , conducted more than 340 official jobs in 2012 , up from around 330 in 2011			1
his recent bouts of ill health have led to concerns that he is doing too much			0
he began the year with strict instructions from doctors to rest after undergoing emergency heart surgery for a blocked artery			1
in june , he suffered a serious bladder infection , believed to have been aggravated by the bad conditions at the river pageant			1
in august , the infection returned and he spent another five days in hospital			0
it is known that the @entity27 wants her husband to take life a little easier but @entity1 is not one to heed such advice			2
@entity27 , who is herself 86 , is equally busy – conducting more than 370 engagements over the past year , a slight rise on 2011			0
although she is gradually cutting back on her public commitments , it is clear she is also determined to uphold her strong work ethic			0
prince @entity36 and @entity37 continue to be the hardest - working members of the @entity39 , conducting just under 600 engagements each over the past year			1
although @entity36 ’s total is slightly down on the previous year , aides say this was largely due to three foreign tours which involved several days of travel			0
the @entity46 expanded her diary , carrying out more than 270 official engagements – a rise of nearly 12 per cent on 2011			0
visit : the queen and the @entity1 inside a giant motorhome during a visit to @entity53 of @entity55 caravan and motorhome manufacturers in november prince @entity57 , who was forced to quit his role as a trade ambassador in 2011 after a string of scandals , carried out around 400 @entity63 - based engagements over the past year			1
he also managed to squeeze in several meetings with old friends , including representatives from @entity67 , @entity68 and , most controversially , @entity69 , a country which has been accused of human rights abuses and widespread corruption			0
although they are arguably the most high - profile royals besides the @entity27 , the @entity1 and @entity74 and prince @entity75 carried out relatively few engagements , as both @entity77 and his brother – who conducted 95 and 71 engagements respectively – have full - time jobs in the @entity81			2
@entity82 of @entity83 has no full - time job and carried out only 122 public engagements , but aides stressed that she is a military wife , not a full - time working royal			0
