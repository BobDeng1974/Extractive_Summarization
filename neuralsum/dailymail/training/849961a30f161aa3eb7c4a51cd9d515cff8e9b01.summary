another photo shows fishermen in @entity108 casting their nets into water bodies created in the drought that serve as a food source to the local villages , while a different image shows a solitary fisherman in the @entity108 emptying his left - over catch after finishing work so that seagulls can enjoy leftover food , showing how nature can live in harmony with humans			1

the @entity163 by @entity164 : fishermen casting their nets in a water body , which was created in the drought prone districts of @entity108 to combat dry spells			0
these water bodies also serve as food suppliers to the local villages fight for life cycle by @entity175 : red ants kill a fly for food that is clinging to a small circular root @entity180 took a photograph of a @entity182 jumping spider feasting on an insect			1
the spiders use their keen vision to calculate the exact distance between themselves and their prey			0
