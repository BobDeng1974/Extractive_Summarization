his brief is clear : to inject some impetus into @entity4 ’s ailing season before it becomes too late , to find some stability , solidity and momentum to rescue a campaign in danger of being tossed away			1
yesterday , we started to see @entity12 ’s blueprint emerge			2
this was not far off how the @entity4 boss would have pictured life when he took over from @entity16 less than a fortnight ago			1
his team were purposeful , direct and pretty good to watch , certainly far too strong for a @entity20 side whose performance was described by their manager @entity21 as ‘ chalk and cheese ’ from recent weeks			2
@entity24 celebrates with his team - mate @entity25 after he scores their side 's first goal @entity29 doubles his side 's lead with a finish past @entity20 goalkeeper @entity33 @entity4 : @entity34 ; @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 ( c ) , @entity38 ; @entity39 , @entity25 , @entity40 ( @entity41 72 ) , @entity24 ; @entity29 ( @entity42 73 ) , @entity43 ( @entity44 89 ) subs not used : @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 scorers : @entity24 ( penalty ) 25 ; @entity29 34 @entity20 : @entity33 ; @entity52 , @entity53 ( c ) , @entity54 , @entity55 ; @entity56 , @entity57 ( @entity59 ht ) , @entity60 ( @entity62 ht ) , @entity63 ; @entity64 , @entity65 ( @entity66 64 ) subs not used : @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 scorer : @entity63 71 booked : @entity63 , @entity53 referee : @entity74 ( @entity75 ) attendance : 19,340 ( 2,311 away ) there was an end to their @entity79 goal drought , dating back to november 4 , with strikes from @entity24 , a penalty , and @entity29			1
that monkey is off their backs			2
and there was warm appreciation from the home crowd , who have noticed a swift improvement and seemingly taken @entity12 ( right ) to their hearts			2
he already has a ‘ @entity95 ’ in any case , singling lustily in the second half			2
frustrations from the 1 - 0 home loss to @entity98 in his maiden match before @entity101 and @entity103 ’s last - minute equaliser for @entity104 on @entity105 were replaced with cheer as 2014 ticks over into 2015			2
‘ it ’s nice for me , i can enjoy a glass of red tonight , which always tastes a little bit better when you win , ’ said @entity12			2
‘ i ’m delighted with the players			0
their application in the short time i ’ve been at the club has been great			0
and i ’m delighted for the fans			0
’ ‘ application ’ was one of three qualities demanded by @entity12 in his programme notes			0
the others were ‘ attitude ’ and ‘ character ’			0
the first two were in evidence from the off , as @entity4 set about their business energetically and incisively , gaining a two - goal lead by half - time			1
@entity4 's @entity35 gestures to referee @entity74 after @entity20 's @entity63 ( not pictured ) scores his side 's only goal of the game before @entity4 had a chance to complete their substitutions the ‘ character ’ part came towards the end , after @entity63 ’s thunderbolt in controversial circumstances gave @entity20 , who had scored 13 in their three previous outings , hope of an unlikely revival			1
@entity63 ’s goal prompted howls of derision from the crowd as @entity4 were down to 10 men after @entity40 required treatment and about to make a double substitution			1
but just as the fourth official was about to illuminate his board , referee @entity74 waved play on and @entity20 scored			1
‘ the referee seemed to take the law into his own hands , ’ said @entity12			0
‘ for some reason he would n’t let us make that change , it was extraordinary			0
’ @entity4 boss @entity12 celebrates after his side claim the three points against @entity20 @entity21 argued his players had technically done nothing wrong since the referee had allowed play to continue			1
in the end , it did n’t matter			0
the late @entity20 onslaught never materialised and @entity12 claimed his first victory in charge at the third attempt			0
they led on 25 minutes when @entity63 got into a muddle and hauled down @entity38 at a corner			1
@entity24 sent @entity33 the wrong way with his penalty			1
nine minutes later , the lively @entity43 was played clear down the right following a neat passing move and crossed for @entity29 to finish			1
@entity12 is keen on signing @entity177 striker @entity43 on a permanent deal with time up on @entity43 ’s temporary loan deal from @entity177 , this could be the last @entity4 see of him but @entity12 is doing everything in his power to keep him			1
‘ it was hopefully not a farewell , ’ he said			0
‘ he deserves the reception , he ’s contributed with goals and good performances			0
there is a structure in place where we can do a deal			1
’ he added , as a caveat , that the dismissal of @entity195 as @entity177 boss had rather left negotiations ‘ in limbo ’			0
the same could be said of @entity4 ’s season at times			1
having missed out on the play - offs by a point last time , 16th was not where their fans expected them to be			0
but , with @entity12 at the helm , the green shoots of recovery are starting to sprout .			0

@entity24 scored @entity4 's opener from the penalty spot
@entity29 doubled scoring before @entity63 scored *consolation*
@entity4 are hoping to secure a permanent deal for @entity43
