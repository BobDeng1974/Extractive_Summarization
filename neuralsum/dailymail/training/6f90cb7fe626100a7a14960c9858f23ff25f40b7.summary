we do n’t have to divert it for ever , but we need it now			2
’ the calls came as : the floodwater surrounding @entity60 continues to remain following heavy rainfall in the area severe flooding in @entity64 yesterday meant ten people two dogs had to be rescued by @entity67 by boat in @entity69 soldiers from @entity71 had to put out sandbags to try and protect buildings in @entity69 , @entity64 , from the severe floods there 's more on the way : winds of 80mph and heavy rain will sweep in from the @entity80 tomorrow , in what forecasters say could be the worst of the dramatic weather so far this winter vehicles tackle a flooded road in @entity87 , @entity64 : flooded areas and sea defences weakened by earlier storms will be bombarded once more billions of pounds of taxpayers ’ money has poured abroad to help those affected by flooding			1
the government has set up the @entity96 , which will give £ 3.87billion over five years to help developing countries ‘ mitigate and adapt to climate change ’			2
