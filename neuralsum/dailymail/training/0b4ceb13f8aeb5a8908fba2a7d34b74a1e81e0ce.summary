a ‘ @entity2 jobs for @entity2 workers ’ row erupted yesterday as it emerged that a new £ 1billion wind farm off the @entity6 coast is being maintained by teams of workers flown in from @entity9			1
as he officially opened the offshore scheme yesterday , deputy prime minister @entity10 claimed 30,000 @entity2 jobs would be created by the end of the decade by investing in renewable energy			1
but local mps and businessmen said this appeared a hollow promise			0
because turbines for the @entity22 scheme off @entity23 are made in @entity24 , @entity24 and @entity26 workers are being drafted in daily to work on them			2
@entity28 will even begin a six - days - a - week service between @entity30 and @entity31 in october to keep up with demand			1
the whole construction of the wind farm was largely foreign , with a @entity36 company making the cabling in @entity38 and @entity39 and the foundations being manufactured in @entity41			0
@entity42 , who runs a renewable energy consultancy , said @entity2 was in the ‘ craziest possible situation ’ where the @entity50 was ‘ subsidising development to a huge degree but doing absolutely nothing to either guarantee or support @entity2 content ’ in offshore wind farms			1
‘ there are turbines out there in the @entity55 which have not touched @entity2 mainland , ’ he said			2
@entity58 mp @entity57 warned that if the industry did not train @entity2 people to service and maintain the turbines , there was little prospect of any domestic jobs premium from the so - called ‘ @entity64 ’			1
announcing £ 66million of fresh government funding for the offshore wind industry , mr @entity10 said the investment would help to make the @entity2 a ‘ world leader ’ in the sector and create an employment boom , contributing £ 7billion to the economy			1
he compared climate change sceptics who oppose wind farms and other renewable energy developments to the @entity76 who smashed machinery during the @entity78			1
‘ i think this industry will get bigger and bigger year in year out , which means more jobs in the local area			2
i know there are many local concerns that the focal work on these wind farms is performed by those flown from elsewhere , yet there are promising signs , ’ said mr @entity10			2
‘ as a government we ’ve announced an offshore wind strategy that should lead to 30,000 @entity2 jobs being created by the end of this decade and we are working with the industry to make sure that the @entity2 supply chain are given a fair crack of the whip in the future			1
’ mr @entity10 hopes the industry will more than quadruple in size by 2020 – at the highest end of government predictions – with half the production coming from domestic firms			0
but his claims were dismissed by industry experts , who said the targets and job creation predictions were hopelessly optimistic			0
they say unless major companies can be persuaded to manufacture wind turbines in the @entity2 , wind farms will continue to be built , but few jobs will go to @entity2 workers			1
deputy prime minister @entity10 looks out of a helicopter window as he flies over the wind farm yesterday mr @entity42 said : ‘ if the government does n’t succeed in bringing wind farm manufacturing to the @entity2 in the near future then we will miss out on the tens of thousands of jobs that have been promised and they will go to mainland @entity124 instead			1
’ mr @entity57 , mp for @entity126 , said : ‘ if we do not act now , we will be in the same position by 2020 and will have to import skills and expertise while our own school leavers and young adults continue to languish in unemployment			0
’ @entity31 has a history of industrial unrest over foreign workers ‘ taking @entity2 jobs ’			1
workers at the @entity138 at @entity139 , @entity6 , staged unofficial strikes and mass protests four years ago because 400 @entity143 and @entity144 workers were being brought in to work on a major construction project			0
giant floating barges were being used to house the hundreds of foreign workers who were involved in building a de-sulphurisation unit at the total refinery			0
the £ 300million contract was put out to tender and won by an @entity143 firm which angered unions by bringing in @entity124 rather than hiring locals in an area of high unemployment			0
a mass walkout by workers at the @entity159 refinery led to copycat action across the @entity2			2
employees at power stations and refineries across the country held ‘ sympathy ’ walkouts in protest at the use of foreign workers			0
a deal was eventually struck to give some new jobs to @entity2 workers , although no foreign employees at the total refinery lost their jobs			1
the @entity175 , a leading think - tank , also found mr @entity10 ’s claims were optimistic and said greater certainty was needed to attract investment			0
generous taxpayer - funded subsidies for wind farms are set to continue until the end of the decade , but foreign energy firms want a longer - term commitment			1
proposals for a new @entity188 wind turbine factory in @entity189 were given planning permission in may last year			0
but the @entity38 firm wants more concrete promises before it goes ahead with the £ 80million factory , which would create 700 direct jobs and thousands in the supply chain			0
ministers have promised guaranteed prices – fixed at up to triple the market rate – for electricity from offshore wind until 2019			0
they say the financial incentive will make @entity2 an attractive place to invest and transform our energy supply , but the difference between the wholesale price and the agreed rate will have to be met by consumers			2
dr @entity209 , of the @entity210 , a @entity2 charity publishing data on the energy sector , said : ‘ even if the government ’s optimistic assumptions are right , the fact is that wind jobs are soft jobs and dependent on subsidies that increase energy costs and destroy jobs in real businesses			1
‘ we ca n’t be sure that the wind jobs will be in the @entity2 , but there is no doubt at all that the jobs lost through high energy costs really will be @entity2			1
’ energy secretary @entity228 said : ‘ local people can absolutely benefit from the workers who come from abroad			2
we want to have a lot more @entity2 jobs in the industry , that is why we are publishing the industrial strategy			1
we want to make sure we get the jobs in the supply chain			0
‘ at the moment because we are coming from a small base it has n’t been , but we believe the potential here is huge			0
’ councils across the @entity2 have spent more than £ 7.2million on charging points for electric cars over the past three years yet many are not being used			2
one in six councils had at least one point not used at all over the past year , and less than a third of authorities had a charging point being used on average more than once a week , figures obtained by the @entity248 revealed .			0

offshore scheme off @entity256 is being maintained by workers flown in from @entity9
@entity28 to run six - days - a - week service between @entity30 and @entity31 to keep up with demand
deputy prime minister claimed 30,000 @entity2 jobs would be created by the end of the decade by investing in renewable energy
