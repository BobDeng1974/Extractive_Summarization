you might think the @entity1 is the most obese nation in the world - but if you do , you are wrong			1
soaring rates of obesity in the @entity9 , nations in the @entity4 east of @entity5 and @entity6 , have shot to the top of the worldwide obesity scale			1
previously it has been theorised that @entity13 are genetically predisposed to obesity			0
but experts now say the introduction of @entity18 diets to the islands are to blame for the problem			1
@entity21 , found south of @entity21 , tops the chart , with 75 per cent of the population reported as obese			2
graphic shows an epidemic of obesity across most of the @entity1 , @entity27 , @entity5 and the @entity28			1
the scale shows the percentage of each country 's populations that is defined as obese , with a @entity33 of over 30			1
the @entity9 , east of @entity5 , are the countries with the largest percentage of their population reported as obese			1
in @entity21 , three quarters of the population is dangerously fat most of @entity40 and @entity41 are shown in turquoise , with low levels of obesity , while most of the @entity1 , @entity27 , @entity5 , the @entity28 are shown in orange , indicating high levels of obesity @entity48 and the @entity49 , also found in the @entity4 , come in second and third places with 71 per cent and 63 per cent of the population obese			1
the islands were colonised by @entity5 , @entity21 , @entity54 , @entity55 or @entity56 nations after the @entity57 , and the diets and social changes introduced blamed for soaring obesity rates			1
these colonising nations sought to ‘ civilise ’ the islanders and introduce ‘ proper ’ food habits , research has shown			1
they encouraged dependency on imported food , meaning the local fishing and farming industries on the islands died out			1
traditional foods of the islands such as fresh fish , meat and local fruits and vegetables have been replaced by rice , sugar , flour , canned meats , canned fruits and vegetables , soft drinks and beer			2
@entity85 researchers said these newly introduced foods are ‘ energy - dense , nutrient poor ’ products which have led to rising levels of obesity			2
these @entity18 foods also became a sign of social status among the islanders , research published in the @entity93 found			2
islanders were taught to fry their fish , rather than eat it raw as they had done before			0
these social changes happened very quickly because of the islands being small and populated by close knit communities			0
the @entity9 and @entity104 are top of the global obesity scale			1
@entity21 tops the chart , with 75 per cent of the population reported as obese			2
@entity48 and the @entity49 , also found in the @entity4 , come in second and third places with 71 per cent and 63 per cent of the population obese one theory is that the @entity13 are genetically pre-disposed to become obese			0
however , @entity85 researchers say food preparation and cooking habits brought in by @entity18 nations are to blame			1
the islands ' farming and fishing industries were destroyed and they began to rely on foreign imports of foods like rice and sugar , they said in the @entity1 and @entity120 , 33 per cent of the population is obese , with the @entity55 and @entity5 not far behind with 27 per cent of the population dangerously fat			1
nutritionists warn obesity - related diseases like heart disease and diabetes are now the world 's biggest killers the colonising nations also introduced mining , making land that had previously been used for food gathering infertile			2
pollution from colonial shipping also degraded reefs , which were formerly a rich food source			0
professor @entity137 , of the @entity85 , said : ‘ previous attempts to explain the disproportionately high rates of obesity in these and other island nations have tended to focus on the geographical isolation of islands and the risk of food shortages			1
' theories have suggested that islanders are genetically predisposed to putting on weight , but we believe this does not explain why obesity has emerged so rapidly on these islands			2
' interventions that tap into the naturally occurring social networks on the islands provide a new , and we believe more effective , way of tackling obesity			2
’ @entity156 and @entity157 came joint last on the list , with 1 per cent of people in these countries carrying too much weight			0
@entity163 , came second to bottom , with just over 1 per cent of the population reported to be obese			0
in fact , the map reveals extremely low obesity rates over most of @entity40 and @entity41			1
the @entity55 has almost 27 per cent obesity whereas @entity56 , @entity170 and @entity171 fared considerably better with a less than 10 per cent rate of obesity in the @entity1 a third of the population is obese			1
@entity176 says highly processed , sugar - rich convenience foods and drinks are to blame for high obesity , and the chronic disease it causes			2
she says the levels of sugar consumed in @entity18 nations like the @entity1 and @entity185 is ' frankly alarming '			1
she said : ' sugar is addictive , leading to food craving and overeating - combined with the fact that highly processed foods are devoid of nutrients and as a result do n't satisfy hunger ' experts have said there are high levels of malnutrition in these areas of the world , with some people struggling the calories needed to reach their full physical potential			1
@entity202 , of the @entity203 , explains : ‘ from west @entity40 , @entity40 , to the horn of @entity40 to @entity41 , we see high levels of under nutrition			1
' ‘ in @entity157 , @entity156 and @entity163 in particular , large sectors of the population struggle to have access to the calories they need			0
' they also struggle to access the vitamins and minerals they need to reach their full physical and intellectual potential			0
‘ it ’s been recognised in studies , that the largest number of people malnourished live in south @entity41 , and this graph is drawing on that			0
‘ they have rapidly growing population and the food demands are high			0
‘ the largest proportion of populations malnourished occurs in sub @entity227			0
‘ these are parts of the world where there are high levels of poverty			2
people are unable to buy the most nutritious food for their families			0
‘ in @entity157 you have an economy based on subsistence farming - farmers making enough food to feed themselves and their families			0
there is a range of obesity rates across @entity245			2
@entity246 ( pictured in orange ) has an obesity rate of 25 per cent			0
comparably , in @entity250 ( pictured in green ) , 18 per cent of the population is obese there is a range of obesity rates across @entity245			1
@entity246 ( pictured in orange ) has an obesity rate of 25 per cent			0
comparably , in @entity250 ( pictured in green ) , 18 per cent of the population is obese obesity rates across @entity257 also vary			1
in @entity259 ( pictured in orange ) , 30 per cent of the population is obese , which is almost as high as rates in the @entity1 and @entity120			1
@entity263 ( pictured in green ) has an obesity rate of 19 per cent ' climate change can make it difficult for farmers to feed their family and make a living from their produce at market			0
‘ but many of these countries have made great strides compared to where we were 20 years ago			0
' the map , created using data from the @entity1 @entity279 , shows the global obesity crisis is still a growing issue , as every continent faces a weight issue			2
the results show the rising epidemic of fatness across the globe , with high levels of obesity across most of @entity27 , the @entity28 and @entity290			1
in the @entity55 , more than 25 per cent of the population is reported as obese , whereas @entity56 , @entity170 and @entity171 fared considerably better , with an obesity rate of less than 10 per cent			1
in the @entity1 , 33 per cent of people are obese , while 27 per cent of @entity5 carry too much weight			1
a person is considered obese if they have a @entity33 ( @entity33 ) is over 30 , and severely obese if they have a @entity33 of over 40			0
@entity176 said : ' preventable chronic diseases , often linked to obesity , are now the world 's biggest killers			0
there are low levels of obesity throughout most of @entity40			0
@entity157 ( pictured in the east , in turquoise ) was the country with the lowest level of obesity , at just over one per cent			0
experts said there are high levels of poverty in @entity40			1
people are unable to access the calories they need to fulfil their physical and intellectual potential , @entity315 , of the @entity203 , said ' and if you look at the countries where obesity and chronic disease have their strongest hold and try to understand what has been done differently in recent history - the common denominator is a massive shift in what these nations eat and drink			2
' my research points the finger at highly processed , sugar - rich convenience foods and drinks lying behind all forms of chronic disease and obesity			0
' in non-western cultures , where traditional diets predominantly consist of unprocessed foods and are low in sugar , it takes only one generation of people eating a more typical @entity18 diet , high in sugar and refined flour , to become predisposed to obesity and develop diabetes			1
this is true around the world from @entity349 to isolated @entity351 communities			0
' considering the time and effort it would take to yield just one teaspoon of sugar from chewing on a sugar cane , highlights that the ' normal @entity18 ' consumption of sugar in the form of sweets , convenience foods and soft drinks , is frankly alarming			2
' @entity363 is addictive , leading to food craving and overeating - combined with the fact that highly processed foods are devoid of nutrients and as a result do n't satisfy hunger			0
' so , a vicious circle then develops , leading to a society that is over-fed but under - nourished			0
unfortunately no additional amount of the same food will make up for the missing essential nutrients			0
' and overeating leads to obesity whilst stressing the body , which in turn can lead to the onset of chronic disease			0
' @entity381 , south @entity41 shows low levels of obesity , compared with high levels in the @entity28 and @entity5 and @entity54			1
in @entity386 , less than two per cent of the populaiton is obese , whereas more than 33 per cent of the population in @entity388 has a @entity33 of over 30			0
@entity41 countries have rising populations and high demands for food , experts say , but much of the population still struggles to access enough calories the graphics were created by @entity397 .			2

the @entity9 , east of @entity5 , top the list of countries with the highest percentage of their populations obese
experts have blamed the soaring obesity rates on nations colonising the islands and introducing @entity18 diets
@entity55 , @entity21 and @entity56 colonisers tried to ' civilise ' the nations ' eating habits after the @entity57
their fishing and farming industries died out and the countries became *reliant* on foreign imports like rice and sugar
