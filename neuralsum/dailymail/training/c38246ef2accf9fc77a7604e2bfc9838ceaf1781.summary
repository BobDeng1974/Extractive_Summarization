as @entity1 crashed out of the @entity2 on tuesday evening , a familiar scapegoat emerged			0
@entity3 took much of the immediate blame for failing to properly mark @entity5 , allowing the @entity8 defender a free header from seven yards out			2
as @entity9 prepared to whip in a free kick in the first period of extra-time , @entity3 was seen grabbing @entity5 's shirt as @entity1 got in to their defensive shape			1
@entity5 rises to head @entity15 1 - 0 in front against @entity1 on tuesday night @entity5 was initially being marked by @entity3 but lost him to get a free header in the box a few seconds later , however , @entity5 had drifted behind his marker and fired in what turned out to be the winning goal in @entity15 's 1 - 0 victory			1
but was @entity3 solely to blame ? @entity24 columnist and former @entity1 defender @entity23 disagrees , instead highlighting faults in @entity1 's zonal marking system			1
@entity29 , @entity30 , @entity3 all line up in front of @entity15 's first attacker @entity5 as @entity9 takes his free - kick , @entity5 moves behind his original marker @entity3 @entity29 and @entity30 are marking ' zones ' with no @entity15 players in them due to poor positioning @entity3 moves forward as @entity39 goes into his ' zone ' ' it 's not @entity3 's fault the goal ! in zonal defence you attack the space in front of you ! @entity39 goes in front of him so he goes with him , ' @entity23 wrote on kicca			1
' the fault initially is @entity29 , @entity30 & @entity3 should all come back 3 yards so @entity51 is in @entity30 position etc. ' as @entity9 takes it there are 3 @entity15 players between @entity57 / @entity56 that 's the problem those 2 are wrong side so there 's too much space for them to run into			2
' indeed , replays of the goal seem to back up @entity23 's assertions as @entity29 and @entity30 's starting position mean @entity9 's ball drifts completely past them into an area where @entity15 's players have plenty of room to run in to			0
as @entity1 line up to to defend the free - kick , @entity72 is marking @entity39 but as the ball comes in to the box , @entity72 fails to track @entity39 's run @entity72 's is left back near the penalty spot , while @entity39 has moved into @entity3 's zone @entity3 jumps with @entity39 , leaving @entity5 with a free header to score in effect , @entity29 and @entity30 were defending ' zones ' they did not need too as @entity15 had no players in or attacking that space			1
therefore , as @entity23 says , @entity1 's line should have moved three yards back			0
@entity3 , meanwhile , can be seen stepping forward and challenging @entity39 as the @entity15 striker moves into his ' zone ' after losing his marker @entity72			0
had @entity72 stayed with @entity39 then @entity3 may not have had to step forward and may have been better positioned to challenge @entity5			0
@entity3 must take responsibility for his lack of movement during his brief cameo at @entity93 , but to blame him for the goal - is that really fair ?			0

@entity3 was initially marking @entity5 from free - kick
but @entity1 striker lost his *man* , allowing him to score the winning goal
but @entity23 defends @entity3 saying problems *lie* in zonal system
@entity15 *booked* their place at @entity108 with 1 - 0 win over @entity1
