by @entity1 reporter published : 13:32 est , 2 october 2013 updated : 14:51 est , 2 october 2013 even the most hardened insomniac would struggle to count all the sheep at @entity5 ' biggest one day lamb market			1
hundreds of farmers from all over the nation flock to @entity8 in @entity9 to inspect some of the best lambs in the land			1
an estimated 17,500 mule gimmer lambs , from the upland and hillfarms of northern @entity15 , went under the hammer at one of the biggest events in the farming calender			1
the lambs , largely born and bred on the @entity21 , the @entity22 and @entity23 , are highly prized for their ability to thrive and for their prime meat			1
baa - rmy army : thousands of lambs went on sale at @entity8 in @entity9 , the largest auction of its type in the @entity31 and a major social event among farmers woolly mammoth : visitors turned up in their droves to check out some of the finest sheep on the market and with an average of 1750 lambs an hour leaping through the ring , the auctioneers were selling at breakneck speed from 9.30am until 7.30pm			1
the mule sheep , a cross-breed from a @entity47 ewe and @entity49 ram , are noted for being good mothers , often producing two lambs , and for their hardiness			1
however , the harsh winter and spring have taken their toll on even their sturdy stock			0
@entity58 , foreman at @entity8 , said : ' we have around 17,500 lambs on the catalogue , which is 1600 down on last year			1
' there are a lot less lambs , which is due to a bad winter followed by a terrible spring			2
more lambs were lost but mostly it was due to more single lambs being born rather than twins			2
famous : the sheep auction at the @entity8 in @entity9 has become increasingly popular with around 17,500 lambs being sold in a single day , the sale ring is packed with farmers from across the @entity31 by the end of the day , farmers were expected expected to have paid somewhere around £ 1.75m for the animals ' we are expecting prices to be a bit down on last year 's trade because there is n't a lot of money flying about in the farming industry at the moment			1
there is n't the money about because it was an expensive winter			0
' he said last year 's cold and wet summer resulted in poor crops , which in turn led to higher feed prices			0
he added : ' the price of feed went up from £ 160 to £ 250 a ton and with it being such a bad winter , more of it was needed , so times are tougher			2
' fortunately we 've had a wonderful summer this year , the harvest is in and the hay and farmers are now on with their potatoes , so hopefully it bodes well for next year			0
' in pre- 19th century @entity15 and @entity104 , the majority of the population made their living through agriculture and livestock farming			2
most people lived where they worked , in the fields far from towns , so farmers and their families herded cattle and hauled their produce to markets in nearby towns			2
since many livestock are herd animals , they were historically driven to market ' on the hoof ' to a town or other central location			0
market towns became so important to rural life it was incorporated into their names , such as @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131			0
as traditional market towns developed , they had a wide main street or central market square for people to set up stalls , booths and display livestock for auction			0
a rich social scene grew up around the auctions , with farmers often descending upon taverns in their droves before , after and during the selling			1
locally - raised sheep from @entity148 , the @entity22 , @entity149 and @entity150 fells went up for auction the event was always well - attended and anticipated by the sheep farming community , although it was n't as much of a social event as it was in decades past the harsh winter and spring have taken their toll on even their sturdy stock			1
@entity58 , foreman at @entity8 , said : ' we have around 17,500 lambs on the catalogue , which is 1600 down on last year ' mr @entity58 , 62 , said the event was always well attended and looked forward to by the sheep farming community although it was n't as much of a social event as it was in decades past			1
he said : ' it 's more business - like now - people still like to meet up and have a good chat but there 's not the same craic and the characters there used to be			0
' farmers used to arrive the night before and meet up in the pub , there was a lot of banter			0
it 's more workmanlike now and there are fewer " characters " than there were			0
' however , it 's still a good day out			0
hopefully everyone will come and buy some good lambs and go home happy ! ' the highly sought - after lambs are mainly from hill farms giving them a glowing reputation for thriving when moved to other parts of the country the spectacle was caught as thousands of @entity194 lambs were inspected by potential buyers and tourists from across the country			0

around 17,500 mule gimmer lambs went on sale at one of the biggest events in the farming calendar
auctioneers were worked hard during 10 hours of frantic buying and selling at @entity8 in @entity9
although social aspect of event had *diminished* from times past , *organisers* say the event was fun and *friendly*
