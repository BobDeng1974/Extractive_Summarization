by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 16:00 est , 11 december 2013 updated : 17:13 est , 11 december 2013 @entity3 secretary @entity2 struggled to fend off the latest round of barbs in a @entity7 hearing on wednesday , following revelations that fewer than 365,000 @entity1 have enrolled for medical insurance through government - run marketplaces – including a federal website that will ultimate cost $ 677 million			1
two months into a six - month open enrollment period that the federal government expected to generate 7 million signups , the @entity15 aimed to attract about 1.2 million new insurance customers , according to a september memo released by the @entity18			1
but as of nov. 30 , just over 137,200 @entity1 had chosen insurance policies through the perennially afflicted healthcare.gov			1
and nearly another 227,500 enrolled through the 14 state - run insurance exchanges , whose websites have experienced fewer problems			0
that puts the government about 835,000 enrollments – or 70 per cent – behind its intermediate target			0
the pace of enrollment accelerated in november , compared with an even more anemic october rollout that produced just 106,000 new sign - ups			2
americans who want their insurance coverage to kick in on january 1 must make their first month 's payments by december 23			2
the final deadline for 2014 policies is march 31			2
@entity2 declined to say wednesday how many people have paid those premiums			1
state - based health insurance marketplaces have far outperformed the federal government 's effort , which has been fraught with technical disasters and delays ' some may have paid			2
some may not , ' she told @entity66 @entity65 rep. @entity65			0
' we 're giving you the enrollment numbers			0
' @entity42 deputy press secretary @entity70 hinted to reporters on wednesday that the @entity49 administration is no longer focusing on recruiting a specific number of @entity1 to enroll , focusing instead on balancing the ratio of young , healthy participants with those who are older and more prone to illness			1
' what we need is the right mix of individuals in these exchanges , ' @entity41 said			2
an additional 1.94 million people have registered for accounts on healthcare.gov and learned their eligibility to enroll , the administration announced wednesday , but none of them has chosen an insurance plan and there 's no indication that they will			1
more than 800,000 have been declared eligible for state - administered @entity90 coverage as a result of shopping on healthcare.gov			1
critics point to the number as evidence that the @entity40 system will produce far more government dependents than private insurance buyers			1
@entity99 , for example , has seen 75,000 new medicaid enrollments but just 1,200 new private insurance customers – a ratio of 60 - to - 1 – according to state insurance commissioner @entity103			1
under withering questioning from rep. @entity65 , @entity2 acknowledged that if @entity3 were stalled at 365,000 enrollments by the end of december , it would be 3 million short of its goal			1
' that is correct , sir , ' she said			0
but the federal government insists that enrollment rates have continued to rise during the first one - third of december			0
' evidence of the technical improvements to healthcare.gov can be seen in the enrollment numbers , ' @entity2 told the @entity117 on wednesday			0
@entity119 @entity118 rep. @entity118 grilled @entity2 on the healthcare.gov website 's cost , demanding to know how many taxpayer dollars have been committee to the project 's it costs , and how much of that has already been spent			0
the @entity49 administration , the secretary replied , has ' obligated $ 677 million ' so far , including funds allocated to fix the site 's numerous flaws			1
and $ 319 million of that total has already gone out the door , she said			0
president @entity49 , fresh from a selfie - schmoozing trip to @entity135 , is facing choppy waters back at home as his signature health insurance overhaul law returns disappointing numbers @entity140 also railed against the administration 's habit of using quiet holiday news cycles to announce a pair of new @entity40 delays			1
in one , the administration announced on july 3 that a so - called employer mandate would be pushed back by one year			0
in another , the day before @entity148 brought news of a one - year delay for the online small - business insurance exchange			0
' what new delays will be coming on @entity154 and @entity155 's ? ' @entity140 snarked			0
@entity156 , the director of @entity3 's @entity157 , told reporters during a conference call that ' we think we 're on track and we will reach the total that we thought			0
we 're only two and a half months into a six - month open - enrollment period			0
' ' as many more @entity1 learn about the options available to them at the marketplace , ' @entity156 said , ' we have every reason to believe interest will continue to grow and enrollment will continue to rise			2
' @entity168 , the chief strategy officer at @entity169 , a firm that provides health exchanges to private employees , told @entity172 that the government 's numbers have been ' stunningly , dramatically below expectations			0
' @entity65 have continued to hammer away at the @entity42 and @entity3 over @entity177 's performance , including concerns about its capacity for paying insurance companies once @entity1 purchase their new policies			1
not impressed : expressions from @entity117 members @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187 were typical of wednesday 's duel between @entity2 and her @entity65 detractors in theory , the website 's ' back end ' financial processing system also allows consumers to sign up directly with health insurance companies , but government officials have testified in previous hearings that large portions of it have yet to be built			0
the @entity65 has also focused attention on the 5.5 million @entity1 consumers who have received cancellation letters from their insurers since the oct. 1 start of @entity40 's open enrollment period			2
' far too many @entity1 who were happy and satisfied with their healthcare coverage on january 1st of this year have had the worlds turned upside down , ' @entity207 @entity206 rep. @entity206 of @entity207 said during the committee hearing , which he chaired			2
@entity2 , however , insisted wednesday that ' a lot of individuals who received cancellation notices are thrilled with the choices that are now available to them ' through healthcare.gov			1
the most recent national opinion survey , released tuesday by the @entity218 , shows that just 34 per cent of @entity1 now approve of the job president @entity49 is doing on the health care issue .			1

@entity49 administration projected 1.2 new private insurance customers by the end of november , but produced just 365,000
@entity42 now focusing on recruiting ' the right mix of individuals ' in insurance pools instead of working toward 7 million by the end of march
@entity232 declined to tell @entity233 how many @entity1 have actually paid for the insurance policies they *'ve* *selected*
she insists that many people with cancelled policies ' are thrilled with the choices that are now available to them ' through healthcare.gov '
far more @entity1 are opting for free @entity90 coverage and *avoiding* policies that they must pay for
