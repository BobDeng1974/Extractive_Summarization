by @entity1 reporter published : 17:48 est , 25 may 2013 updated : 17:52 est , 25 may 2013 it may come as a surprise to many hardworking @entity4 , but governments in much of the developed world require employers to give employees varying amounts of paid vacation time			1
that , of course , is not the case in the land of the free and the home of the desperately - in - need - of - some - time - off , which has @entity4 labor advocates calling for reforms to federal labor laws			0
according to a recent study by the left - leaning @entity21 , the @entity4 is the only country out of 21 economically advanced nations to not mandate employers to provide paid vacation time to employees			1
while many @entity4 business voluntarily offer paid vacation time to employees , the study found that roughly one in four @entity4 workers have none			2
additionally , the study finds that those workers who do n't have any paid vacation time are disproportionately employed at low - wage jobs that do n't provide other benefits like health care			2
@entity39 : according to a recent study , only one in four @entity4 workers are given paid vacation time the study included paid - vacation data from 16 @entity43 countries , as well as @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and the @entity4 of the countries included in the study , @entity44 and @entity47 offer employees the largest amount of paid days off , with a total of 35 - 22 for vacation days and 13 for holidays			1
next on the list is @entity56 and @entity57 , each of which require employers to provide 31 paid days off			1
with the exception of the @entity4 - which mandates no paid vacation days - @entity61 requires the fewest amount of paid vacation days with 10			1
" it 's time to bring them into the fold , " economist @entity66 , one of the authors of the study , told the @entity69			0
" there are firms that are profitable and do provide vacation			0
frankly , it concerns me that someone 's business model or success relies on not giving employees vacation			0
" zero : the @entity4 requires employers to provide precisely zero paid vacation days to employees in an effort to get the @entity4 on track with the rest of the developed world , @entity86 congressman @entity85 introduced a bill into @entity92 this week aimed at mandating paid vacation time for workers by amending the @entity95 to include paid vacation time for workers			1
under the bill , businesses with more than 100 employees would be required to provide a week 's vacation to full - time employees , and part - time employees who 've been employed for at least a year and are on the clock for at least 25 hours a week			2
after the proposed law has been on the books for three years , the amount of paid vacation time required would increase to two weeks			0
down under : @entity44 requires businesses to provide employees with a total of 35 paid days off " overwhelmingly , it 's the low - income workers who do n't get the paid vacation , " @entity85 told @entity69			1
" this is accentuated by the fact that many people who do n't get paid vacation only work 30 hours a week , or have less than a full - time job			2
these are the same workers who have no health care coverage and no benefits in general			0
" " we 're really hurting ourselves , and specifically we 're hurting the most vulnerable among us , " he added			0
" if every other advanced country can do this , so can we			0

@entity4 is only country in the developed world that does n't require businesses to provide paid vacation days for employees
in @entity44 , businesses must provide employees with 35 paid days off
@entity56 and @entity57 each require businesses to provide employees with 31 paid days off
