he was just a baby and a product of the bush meat trade			0
some of his family members were being cooked and served			0
' @entity38 also said that @entity9 should have been more careful while he was conducting the tour , and a slight misstep led to his near - fatal mistake			2
speaking out : institute director @entity32 said the chimps both had difficult upbringings before coming to the institute , and should be considered victims along with @entity9 attackers : @entity56 males @entity14 ( left ) and @entity15 ( right ) who pounced on @entity9 at the @entity31 reserve where he was studying their behaviour he said : ' you have to always keep in mind that these are wild creatures			1
[ @entity9 ] had a lapse in judgment across the safety boundary and get too close to the main fence , and he took his eyes off the chimpanzees when he did that			2

@entity9 â€™s mother said that her son had been passionate about chimps since watching a documentary about famous naturalist @entity108 in seventh grade			2

' since he was a little boy he just loved them , and i just have faith that ... when all is said and done , he 's going to go right back into it			0
