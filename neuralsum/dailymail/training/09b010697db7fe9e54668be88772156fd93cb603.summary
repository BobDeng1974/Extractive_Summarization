click here for your ultimate stats guide from the game - including @entity5 's goal miracles do happen , and in the case of @entity8 , they can be made to look ridiculously easy			1
exactly a month ago , after a 5 - 1 drubbing at @entity10 , a disconsolate @entity8 surveyed his ailing side ’s prospects and declared it would take a miracle for them to preserve their @entity17 status and avoid the drop			1
four wins on the spin , a sequence more akin to a team with designs on the title , and , suddenly , the fate @entity20 ’s manager was resigned to has been averted with a game to spare			1
if that was wondrous enough , the way they have done it — not least a vibrant performance at the @entity33 last night that was capped by a goal of rare quality from @entity36 — has been even more astounding			1

@entity79 : 45,181 referee : @entity81 * @entity82 ratings by @entity84 at the @entity33 stunning victories at @entity86 and @entity87 , with an emphatic home win over @entity89 in between , and now @entity59 put to the sword			2
the result all but confirmed @entity93 ’s demotion to the @entity94 , but they can have no complaints			2
if they had a case for staying up , which is debatable , it certainly could not be at the expense of @entity8 ’s revitalised side			0
it could be at @entity103 ’s , but only if they somehow manage to wipe out goal difference arrears of 17			2
now that would be a miracle			0
there was a touch of symmetry , too , about @entity59 being on the receiving end on the night @entity20 secured their @entity17 future			1
they were @entity114 ’s final opponents at the @entity115 last september before the axe fell on his stormy reign			2

we feel ready to take on anyone now , such is the level of confidence in the team			0
fight for the ball : @entity20 's @entity156 striker @entity52 is challenged by @entity72 and @entity67 eyes on the prize : @entity5 vies with @entity73 for the ball ‘ this is the biggest achievement of my life and the happiest i have ever been			1
i think of the fans and the city , the staff and the chairman , and i am just so pleased everyone can head home tonight knowing that they will have @entity17 football to look forward to next season			1
’ @entity20 went in front in the 13th minute , when @entity45 went foraging down the left and whipped in a low cross that @entity5 ’s outstretched boot sent spinning beyond @entity60 ’s despairing right hand			1
opening up : @entity5 scores the first goal for @entity20 against @entity59 the great escape : @entity5 celebrates with @entity43 after his goal @entity20 have picked up the same number of points ( 12 ) from their last four games as they did from their previous 13 games			1
the cushion of a 2 - 0 lead came courtesy of a goal that was brilliantly worked and clinically executed			2
@entity36 played a ball inside to @entity46 and kept advancing towards the area , as his team - mate controlled it and weighed up his options			1
decision made , @entity46 cleverly lifted the ball over @entity59 ’s static defenders and into the path of @entity36 , who by this time had reached the penalty spot and faultlessly finished off a sublime move with a first - time volley on the turn			1
@entity59 briefly rallied in the second half and almost reduced the arrears when @entity73 narrowly failed to convert @entity62 ’s cross as he slid in at the far post			0

the home crowd were ready to forgive anything , as they cheered every tackle and every clearance and marked the start of stoppage time by rising to their feet for a rousing rendition of @entity235 , scarves waved above their heads			0
it was that sort of night , but the mood among home fans was in stark contrast to the dark cloud that hung over @entity242			0
