@entity0 will start in the @entity2 semi-final but the future looks bleak for the @entity5 goalkeeper who has been deposed as @entity7 ’s no 1			1
@entity8 confirmed @entity0 will play ahead of @entity9 against @entity10 at @entity11 on saturday but offered no further guarantees			1
‘ at the moment , i hope yes , ’ said @entity8 , after a long , uncharacteristic hesitation , when asked if @entity0 had a long - term future at the club			1
‘ it is very difficult to answer that question , you know			0
what is important is saturday			0
@entity0 will start in goal for @entity7 for the their @entity2 clash with @entity10 at @entity11 ‘ his attitude is very good			1
he has trained very well , very focused			0
your job is to fight for your place , no matter how difficult it is			0
when you choose this kind of job you know it is down to competition			0
’ @entity0 is understood to be content with his situation and confident of winning back his place			1
his @entity7 contract runs until 2018 , but he has made just three appearances — all in the @entity2 — since an error - strewn display at @entity37 on @entity38			1
@entity7 have greatly improved since the defeat at @entity40 ’s when @entity0 mix - ups led to two goals			1
he then infuriated @entity8 after the game by puffing on a cigarette in the showers			1
the @entity47 international has lost his place to @entity9 after a number of errors this season former @entity7 midfielder @entity50 went on @entity52 television before the smoking revelations and claimed @entity0 had been fined and would not play for @entity8 again			1
the spin machine at the @entity55 set about rubbishing this theory and @entity50 ’s sources , but so far @entity50 has been vindicated			0
@entity9 came in for the next game against @entity59 in the @entity2 third round and stayed in goal when @entity7 played @entity62 in the @entity63 a week later			1
the @entity64 then kept his place			0
‘ they know the rules , ’ said @entity8			1
‘ they are set at the start of the season			0
i replaced @entity0 because he had a bad game			2
i still think he ’s a great goalkeeper and want him to have the opportunity to show that			0
the @entity64 has taken his chance with both hands , winning 11 out the 12 games he 's started in goal ‘ it is important two goalkeepers get competition and he will get that in the @entity2 now as long as @entity81 plays in the @entity63			1
@entity82 play their @entity84 goalkeeper in the @entity85			0
why ? because you need to give them competition			0
’ @entity81 has won 11 of 12 @entity63 games since the @entity0 chop , but he could not prevent a 3 - 1 defeat in the first leg of the @entity85 tie against @entity94 unfussy style has solidified a notoriously brittle team			1
with frailties due to their commitment to attractive football , @entity7 crave reliability from their goalkeeper			2
@entity0 , for all his bravado and talent , was anything but reliable , with a short attention span and a tendency to become bored and seek involvement even when ( especially when ) his team were in control			2
@entity8 admits that @entity0 lost his place to his errors but insists he 's working hard in training @entity81 is a soothing influence and @entity8 ’s belated decision to grasp the nettle has strengthened the team , together with the unexpected advances of @entity117 and @entity118			1
@entity117 has added ball - winning bite to midfield and @entity118 , with his exceptional pace , is not in such a hurry as others to abandon his post at right back and rampage forward			0
add to this a philosophical tweak — a will to defend harder and adjust to different opponents , such as the attempt to combat @entity134 ’s high - intensity pressing game by encouraging @entity81 to kick almost every ball , and @entity7 are sturdier			2
@entity136 was an aberration caused by complacency or , more likely , an indicator that there is more to do			0
@entity8 will be aware of this and was reluctant to smother @entity9 with the credit for a run of 16 wins in 18 games since @entity37			1
‘ it ’s a mixture of things , ’ said @entity8			2
‘ we had many players back			0
@entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152 came back but they came back into form as well in january			0
and @entity117 is doing well			0
’ @entity117 ( centre ) has been one of the success stories of the season and is a key player for @entity7 it was not overwhelming backing for his no 1 and supports the idea that @entity8 will prioritise signing another keeper in the summer when @entity164 ’s @entity163 will be on the market			1
like @entity9 , @entity163 is a calming presence and a mature personality			2
@entity163 also has experience of winning major trophies			0
in short , he is precisely the sort of individual @entity7 have lacked in recent years			2
to invest in @entity163 would be to lose @entity81			0
the @entity64 was happy to sign as no 2 and challenge @entity0 but that is a different psychological proposition to losing your no 1 status to a big - money signing , despite having performed so well			1
it is a delicate issue for @entity8 , a manager often accused of being too loyal			2
for @entity0 , there appears no way back			2
like @entity180 last year , it promises to be the @entity2 and out and proof that @entity50 was right all along			0
a move for @entity163 has been spoken about but it remains to be seen of @entity8 will bring in another keeper			1

@entity0 to play in goal during @entity7 's @entity2 semi-final
the @entity5 international lost the no 1 spot to new signing @entity9
@entity0 could leave the club if another keeper is bought by @entity8
