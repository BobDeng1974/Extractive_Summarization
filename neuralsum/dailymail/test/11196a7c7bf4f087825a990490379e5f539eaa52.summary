the victims of a horrific medical experiment run by the @entity2 in @entity3 that deliberately infected individuals with syphilis in order to test drugs and study the disease are now suing @entity9			1
the lawsuit , which has 750 plantiffs and includes victims and their families , is seeking $ 1billion , claiming that officials from @entity15 approved the study at the time and even helped to plan and monitor it as it ran from 1945 to 1956			1
the few victims who are still alive were almost all children when they were unknowingly infected , and many among them were orphans			1
in the aftermath of the experiment , some of the individuals died of syphilis , with open sores covering their bodies , while those who did survive claim they passed the disease down to their children , ending up with babies that were born blind , severely handicapped , and , in at least one case , without a brain			1
it is estimated approximately 700 people were infected with the disease , and of the roughly 75 % who were treated , only 25 % were reported to have completed their treatment			2
she was told the lie down and spread her legs , which she resisted at first , but eventually succumbed to the doctors around her			0
at that point she claims that men with gauze or cotton on their fingers penetrated her , infecting her with syphilis			2
a few weeks later they called her in to take fluid from her spine , and she says when she turned around to look it was yellow			0
even after the study ended she recalls one instance in which she saw one of her doctors and was convinced he was going to kidnap her to continue studying her			0
in addition to orphans , soldiers , prisoners , mental patients and prostitutes were also sought out for the study			1
prostitutes in particular , who would be injected with the disease and then sent to sleep with prisoners			1
@entity85 's ( above ) husband was infected , and she gave birth to one child who did not have a brain @entity85 's other child was born severely handicapped ( above ) @entity90 did not get infected with the disease during the experiemnt , but her husband did , and it caused major problems with two of their children when he passed it along to her			1
one was born without a brain , while another was born with syphilis which was left untreated , and is now severely handicapped			1
another woman , @entity104 , was born blind , which she believes to be a result of her father having been infected with the disease and , again , not having been treated when she was born with syphilis			1
@entity47 , like @entity43 , is one of the few original patients still alive			1
he was a solider at the time he was first infected , and acknowledges that he infected his wife and others with the disease			1
he was injected with the disease he claims and subjected to numerous tests , and never once told what any of them were for			1
the @entity2 government only admitted to this experiment in 2010 , which was run by dr. @entity119 ( above ) dr. @entity119 was also known for his infamous syphilis experiment in @entity122 , @entity123 ( above ) the @entity2 government only admitted to this experiment in 2010 , which was run by dr. @entity119 , also known for his infamous experiment in @entity122 , @entity123			1
in that study , conducted between 1932 and 1972 , dr. @entity119 and the @entity126 found @entity130 - @entity129 men in @entity123 who had syphilis and claimed they were treating them for the disease , when they were not in fact doing so but rather studying how it progressed			2
they also unknowingly infected some men with syphilis who did not have the disease			2
dr. @entity119 defended the experiment even after public outcry had shut it down , saying in 1993 : ' it was important that they were supposedly untreated , and it would be undesirable to go ahead and use large amounts of penicillin to treat the disease , because you ’d interfere with the study			2
' he would at one point in his career be appointed assistant surgeon general of the @entity2			2
in the end , the experiment resulted in the death of at least 83 individuals from syphilis			2
in 1974 , a $ 10million settlement was awarded along with lifetime medical benefits and burial services to all living participants			0
those benefits later grew to include all direct family members of victims in 1975			0
in that study , conducted between 1932 and 1972 , dr. @entity119 and the @entity126 infected some @entity129 men in @entity123 with syphilis @entity3 president @entity168 ( right ) described the syphilis experiments as ' crimes against humanity ' at the time while president @entity172 and then secretary of state @entity173 apologized ( left ) a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit against the @entity2 government by many of the same plaintiffs in the current @entity54 lawsuit back in 2012			1
that suit listed then secretary of state @entity173 and @entity184 secretary @entity183 as defendants , who released a statement at the time saying ; ' although these events occurred more than 64 years ago , we are outraged that such reprehensible research could have occurred under the guise of public health			0
' they then added ; ' we deeply regret that it happened , and we apologize to all the individuals who were affected by such abhorrent research practices			0
' and while the case was dismissed on a legal technicality , judge @entity194 , who rendered the decision , urged the plaintiffs to appeal for the compensation they deserve			0
the @entity2 government can not be held responsible in a court of law for any action committed in another country			0
' for more than half a century since the time of the @entity3 study , scholars , ethicists and clinicians have worked with government officials to establish rigorous ethical standards for human research			2
@entity54 welcomes bioethical inquiry into the @entity215 's @entity3 study and its legacy , ' @entity15 spokeswoman @entity212 told the @entity217 said in an email			1
' this lawsuit , however , is an attempt by plaintiffs ' counsel to exploit a historic tragedy for monetary gain			0
' one of the attorneys for @entity54 meanwhile calls this suit ' baseless			1
' it was medical historian @entity228 from @entity229 in @entity230 who first unearthed the shocking details of the tests while researching dr. @entity119 's archives in @entity236			0
' i was just completely blown away			0
i was floored , ' she said at the time			0
' i expected to find something on @entity240			0
what he left behind were these records from the @entity3 study			2
' she then said ; ' that was all he left behind			0
why he did this , i have no idea			0
why would you leave this ? '			0

victims and their families of a @entity2 study that infected individuals with syphilis in @entity3 without their knowledge are suing @entity54
in a $ 1billion lawsuit , 750 plaintiffs claim the *college* approved and helped to plan the study , which ran from 1945 to 1956
the victims were mostly orphans , children , prisoners , soldiers , prostitutes and mental patients
@entity43 was just 9 years old when one day at the orphanage she was ordered to go to the infirmary and infected with the disease
@entity47 was a solider who was forcibly injected with syphilis as a soldier and passed it along to his family
@entity85 's husband was infected , and she gave birth to one child who did not have a brain and another who is severely handicapped
another woman , @entity104 , claims she was born blind because he father was infected
blindness , *deformities* , and death are just some of the problems babies born with *congenital* syphilis face
a lawyer for @entity54 has called the suit ' baseless '
