@entity0 are the form team in @entity1 at present , winning 10 games out of their last 11 , including seven in a row			2
their recent success can probably be explained by a number of reasons			0
players have returned from injury at the right time , @entity10 ca n't stop scoring , @entity8 and @entity9 have emerged , while @entity14 seems to have found his drive once again			2
but could there be something else ? with the @entity19 preparing for the @entity21 trip to @entity22 on saturday , one of their partners @entity18 have revealed how some of the first - team stars motivate themselves on the team bus with some interesting and uncharacteristic selections included			1
@entity0 players have revealed their ultimate pre-game playlist ahead of their @entity21 tie with @entity22 @entity10 selected @entity32 's ' @entity33 ' as his selected track for instance , who would have guessed @entity10 was a @entity32 fan ? and can you picture @entity38 nodding along to @entity39 ' before defending at @entity40 ? and that 's not all			1
@entity44 opts for @entity47 legend @entity46 's lead single from his sixth album ' dangerous ' , @entity43 will even find time for some @entity51 rap with @entity53 's track ' @entity55 ' pre-game			1
@entity56 has been in sparkling form in recent months with his languid style of creating from deep			0
so it is perhaps no surprise that the @entity63 playmaker opts for something a bit softer - with pop singer from his homeland @entity68 giving the 30 - year - old all he needs before setting foot off the bus			0
@entity56 's track choice may be slightly more old school , but that 's nothing compared to @entity74			0
the @entity76 forward is obviously @entity77 ' before games with his selection of @entity81 's 1996 summer hip - hop tune , which does n't quite posses the fast pace we expect from @entity74 on the pitch			1
@entity56 's style of music seems to suit him - selecting @entity63 pop star @entity68 's slow track @entity44 appears to be a fan of up - beat dance music , opting for @entity46 track ' dangerous ' @entity38 may prepare for defending at @entity40 by listening to ' happy ' by @entity91 @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 are the youngest players on the list , so it is perhaps no surprise they go for recent and more mainstream hits			1
@entity104 's house track ' @entity102 ' , @entity107 's smash record ' @entity105 ' , ' end credits by drum and bass duo @entity109 ( ft @entity111 ) , the @entity113 ' indie toe - tapper ' arabella ' and @entity115 's ' @entity114 ' are there respective selections			0
the light - hearted activity is designed to bring fans closer to their heroes , giving an insight into day in the life of a @entity21 footballer before an important game			0
' as @entity0 's official car and van rental partner , we wanted to bring travelling fans closer to their heroes so they can be inspired by the player 's ultimate playlist which will get them fired up for another important game this weekend , ' explained @entity132 , managing director , @entity133			1
' it 's certainly an eclectic playlist			0
' we wish @entity0 the very best of luck in the match			0
' @entity22 are desperate for three points at the bottom of the table , while the @entity19 are looking to keep their faint title chances alive with a win in the saturday evening fixture			1
@entity51 goalkeeper @entity43 selected a rap song from his home country - @entity53 's ' @entity55 ' @entity74 opted for a 1996 summer jam - @entity81 's laid back @entity147 ''			2
