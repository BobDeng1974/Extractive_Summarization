scientists have revealed new insight into the evolution of flight by carrying out a series of wind tunnel experiments based on dinosaur fossils			1
after new fossil discoveries sparked debate over the evolution of birds and their abilities to fly , the history of feathered dinosaurs and their flying functions became less clear			0
but a group of researchers at the @entity17 believe they have put an end to speculation by examining the flight performance of the early @entity21			1
but the @entity21 implies the evolution of bird flight passed through a four - wing phase , representing an important stage in the evolution of gliding and flapping			2
the scientists performed a series of wind tunnel experiments and flight simulations with winds of 45mph , using a full - scale representation of the dinosaur with surprising results			1
the experiments showed the @entity21 would have been most stable gliding when generating large amounts of lift with its wings			0
the wind tunnel demonstrated this had certain advantages as the high lift coefficient allows for slow glides , which can be achieved with less height loss			0
the early @entity70 dinosaur was a paravian -- a classification of dinosaurs that were closer to birds than species like the @entity76 dr @entity77 and colleague dr @entity78 adjusted the @entity21 's wing and tail position to see the effect it had on stability fossils revealed the @entity85 had feathers on its arms , legs and tail as well as wings leading to debate over the evolution of bird flight for gliding down from low elevations , such as trees , this slow , and aerodynamically less efficient flight was the gliding strategy that results in minimal height loss and longest glide distance			1
the results prove debate surrounding the position and orienatation of the dinosaur 's legs and wind shape is irrelevant , as these variables made very little difference to the @entity21 's flight			1
@entity77 , a senior lecturer in vertebrate palaeontology at the university and co-author of the study , said : ' significant to the evolution of flight , we show that @entity21 did not require a sophisticated , ' modern ' wing morphology to undertake effective glides , as the high - lift coefficient regime is less dependent upon detail of wing morphology			2
a representation shows two multicolored @entity122 in flight over wet land in prehistoric times the @entity17 's recreation of the dinosaur reveals its feather wings and paddle - like tail ' this is consistent with the fossil record , and also with the hypothesis that symmetric ' flight ' feathers first evolved in dinosaurs for non-aerodynamic functions , later being adapted to form aerodynamically capable surfaces			2
' his co-author , @entity78 , said : ' what interests me is that aerodynamic efficiency is not the dominant factor in determining @entity21 's glide efficiency			0
' however , it needs a combination of a high lift coefficient and aerodynamic efficiency to perform at its best			0
' the study - @entity149 performance of the feathered dinosaur @entity21 and the evolution of feathered flight - is published in the latest issue of @entity154 .			0

researchers at the @entity17 spent a month *constructing* a life - sized @entity21
experiments placed the model in a wind tunnel with winds of up to 45mph
scientists adjusted the wing and tail position to examine flight abilities of dinosaur
