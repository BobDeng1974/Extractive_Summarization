by @entity0 , education correspondent thousands of summer - born children will be able to start school a year later to stop them being disadvantaged by the age gap with their winter - born classmates			1
there is growing evidence that children born late in the academic year who start school at four are already at a disadvantage just 12 months later			2
ministers have now sent guidance to schools and councils that could end the anguish of parents whose children are forced to start formal education at barely four			2
under the new plan , children born in summer will be allowed to start at five ( picture posed by models ) they acted after becoming concerned about the number of disputes between education authorities and parents over the issue			0
the guidelines make it clear that parents have the right to request their summer - born children start reception classes at five instead			1
schools and councils must consider the requests in light of ‘ research into the outcomes of summer - born and premature children ’			1
the advice applies to those born between april 1 and august 31			0
the @entity43 guidance says : ‘ in recent months , an increasing number of cases have come to the attention of the department and ministers in which parents , local authorities and admissions authorities have struggled to agree on the year group in which it is most appropriate for a summer - born child to start school			1
’ the advice , drawn up with help from parents , adds : ‘ there are no statutory barriers to admitting a child of five to a reception class			1
’ @entity43 figures show 62 per cent of those born between may and august fail to meet minimum expected levels in areas such as reading , writing , speaking , maths and listening			0
research has shown that summer - born children can be disadvantaged by going to school earlier than their winter classmates by contrast , just 40 per cent of children born between september and december fall behind			1
the report said : ‘ month of birth has the largest impact on the literacy and mathematics areas of learning			0
’ separate research has shown that , on average , summer - borns do worse at @entity83 and a-level and are less likely to go to university			2
they are also more likely to be bullied and be unhappy at school			0
the @entity88 says the disparity between september and august - born children is so great that summer - borns should be given weighted test results to compensate			1
campaigners welcomed the guidance yesterday but called on ministers to go further and introduce an absolute right for summer - borns to start reception classes at five			1
@entity99 , 40 , of @entity100 , @entity101 , wants her may - born son @entity102 to start school at five , but the county council has refused			0
she said some councils try to make summer - borns who wanted to start school later join year one instead of reception , forcing them to lose a year of education			2
mrs @entity99 , 40 , who helps run the group @entity112 , added : ‘ councils are worried about the floodgates opening			0
’ one private school is planning to start lessons at 1.30pm			0
