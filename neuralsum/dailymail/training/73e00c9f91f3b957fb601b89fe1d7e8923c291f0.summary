by @entity0 published : 11:45 est , 12 february 2013 updated : 11:46 est , 12 february 2013 teenagers with @entity2 are more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol , with cannabis a particular problem teenagers with the hyperactivity disorder @entity2 are more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol , new research has found			1
a study discovered contrary to previous findings current medications for the condition do not counter the risk for substance abuse among adolescents			1
scientists believed that a side effect of taking the prescribed medicines lowered the chance of teenagers drinking or taking drugs			2
but new research claims there is a ' significantly higher prevalence ' of alcoholism and cannabis smoking among young adhd sufferers			0
they also claim that cigarette smoking was nine per cent higher in @entity2 teens than youths did not have it			2
professor @entity32 , from the @entity33 , led the study of 600 children over an eight year period			0
the aim was to discover if children with @entity2 have an increased risk of substance use and abuse or dependence in adolescence			1
the researchers found that when the subjects were an average of 15 years - old , 35 per cent admitted using one or more substances , compared with 20 per cent of @entity49 teens			1
by the age of 17 , cannabis use was ' particularly problematic ' , with 13 per cent hooked compared to three per cent of teenagers without the condition			1
@entity55 smoking was ' very high ' at 17 per cent which , claims professor @entity57 , is much higher than the @entity59 national average			0
but alcohol abuse was high in both groups suggesting that underage drinking was a common occurrence for teenagers in general			2
but alcohol abuse was high among all teenagers in the study , suggesting underage drinking is a common occurrence for teenagers in general professor @entity57 said : ' this study underscores the significance of the substance abuse risk for both boys and girls with childhood adhd			1
' these findings also are the strongest test to date of the association between medication for adhd and teenage substance abuse			2
' at least two per cent of children in the @entity84 are thought to have adhd and diagnosis usually occurs between the ages of three and seven			0
symptoms include a short attention span , restlessness or constant fidgeting and being easily distracted			0
in contrast to current thinking , professor @entity57 found that substance abuse rates were no different in children being treated with medication for adhd than those who were not			0
that has prompted a call for a new approach to substance abuse prevention and treatment methods for boys and girls with @entity2			1
professor @entity57 added : ' we are working hard to understand the reasons why children with @entity2 have increased risk of drug abuse			1
' our hypotheses , partly supported by our research and that of others , is that impulsive decision making , poor school performance , and difficulty making healthy friendships all contribute			0
' some of this is biologically driven because we know that @entity2 runs in families			0
however , similar to managing high blood pressure or obesity , there are non-medical things we can do to decrease the risk of a bad outcome			0

new study *disproves* previous theory that medication can prevent teenagers abusing drink and drugs
35 **%** of those with @entity2 used one or more substances , compared with 20 **%** who did *n't* have condition
cannabis abuse a particular problem
