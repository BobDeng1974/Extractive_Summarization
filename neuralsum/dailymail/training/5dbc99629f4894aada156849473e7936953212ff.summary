by @entity0 published : 06:11 est , 22 april 2013 updated : 09:36 est , 22 april 2013 four - year - old @entity1 is at risk of dying from a seizure every time he falls asleep , gets excited or is bored			1
since his birth he has suffered thousands of epileptic fits because he was born with a unique combination of rare neurological conditions			1
even the delight at hearing the doorbell ring is enough to cause the youngster to black out and lose all control			2
fragile : for young @entity1 from @entity16 , the things that make childhood fun are what put his life at risk his parents @entity21 and @entity22 must keep a close eye on him constantly , as he is susceptible to a fit at any time			1
@entity1 suffers three separate neurological conditions			1
he has @entity28 malformation that causes epilepsy and increases the risk of stroke			2
it affects only around one in every 50,000 babies			0
he also has widespread intercranial haemangioma , a rolling ball of blood vessels in his skull , as well as an abnormal collection of blood vessels under his skin , which are visible as a blue mark on his face and forehead			1
and , if that was n't enough , he also suffers with cortical dysphasia , an abnormality in the brain ’s development , which causes the electrical signals to misfire , which also triggers seizures			1
the combination of these diseases means that the youngster suffers from frequent seizures , which vary dramatically in severity and length			1
most last for just a few seconds but some can go on for several minutes			0
the seizures occur throughout the day and night			2
the most serious of which leaves his mother unable to rouse him from his sleep			0
doctors mistook the blue veins on @entity1 's forehead for a bruise immediately after his birth little did doctors know that @entity1 suffered a unique combination of three different neurological disorders it first became apparent there was something seriously wrong with @entity1 shortly after he was born at @entity77			1
he had to be resuscitated as he stopped breathing when the umbilical cord became wrapped around his neck during labour			0
@entity1 , weighing just 5lb 1oz , was then taken to the neonatal unit , where staff originally thought bruising on his head was caused by the forceps used to deliver him			1
but they soon realised it was more serious and scans showed his brain had developed abnormally			0
genetic testing and mri scans were then carried out , before doctors confirmed his unique diagnosis			1
mrs @entity94 said : ‘ the wind dropped out of our world			0
‘ @entity1 had to be resuscitated after birth because his umbilical cord wrapped around his neck ‘ his mri scan just looked like a mishmash of blood vessels			1
the neurologist calls him a walking miracle because he ca n’t believe the way he is now and the way his brain scan was			2
’ @entity1 has a weakness down his right side and he is slightly smaller than average for his age			1
mrs @entity94 , 34 , from @entity112 , @entity113 , said : ‘ @entity1 ’s had thousands of seizures			1
i try to keep a diary of them			0
‘ in the last month he has had about 100 , but he ’s probably had more than that , because sometimes they ’re so quick , i ca n’t catch them all			0
‘ the slightest thing can trigger it , excitement , boredom , exhaustion			2
he gets excited when his friends come over or when someone arrives at the door and the bell rings			0
but his condition is just part of life now			0
‘ sometimes at night you think , “ what if ? ”			0
it ’s always at the back of your mind that something awful could happen but you ca n’t allow yourself to live in fear			0
‘ you ’ve got to enjoy one day at a time and not let it steal your life			2
‘ my biggest fear is @entity1 not being socially accepted because of his condition rather than him dying			1
’ on a good day @entity1 might only suffer two or three seizures , but most days he suffers up to 10			1
but @entity1 , who is hoping to start mainstream school this summer , has astounded everyone with his incredible resilience and determination			1
' medical miracle ' : doctors thought @entity1 would struggle in life but he is astonishingly spritely and able doctors have hailed him a ‘ walking miracle ’			1
indeed despite suffering from multiple seizures every day , he enjoys life like any other happy - go - lucky toddler , and loves nothing more than going to nursery and kicking a football around the garden			1
mrs @entity94 said : ‘ @entity1 does get frustrated sometimes because he is tired a lot of the time			1
but he just takes it all in his stride			0
’ during many of his milder seizures , @entity1 can appear to be daydreaming			1
other times his muscles will go weak and he ’ll fall to the ground			2
some cause him to run about , smack his lips , and mumble incoherently , though he is unconscious at the time and is completely unaware of his actions			0
other seizures make him feel scared or he ’ll get a strange feeling in his stomach			0
he can also suffer from the more serious tonic - clonic seizures , which can be life - threatening			2
mrs @entity94 said : ‘ there is a misconception about epilepsy that you lie down and have a fit			0
but @entity1 ’s are all quite different			1
@entity1 hopes to start mainstream school this summer and has astounded everyone with his incredible resilience bright future : @entity1 now takes medication to help control his symptoms ‘ some of the seizures can just look like naughty behaviour			1
but his eyes will be away in the back of his head and if i click my fingers in front of his face , he wo n’t respond			0
with complex partial seizures he starts mumbling incoherently and runs about all over the place			2
it looks like he is awake but he ’s not			0
‘ i ’ve got to monitor him in the bath and watch he does n’t climb up high			0
‘ there was one time , when we went swimming , @entity1 became excited and had seizure after seizure			1
if i had n’t had a hold of him he would have been under the water			0
@entity1 is a determined young chap who is looking forward to starting school ‘ if he ’s not conscious the worst thing is trying to restrain him			1
you just have to make sure he ’s safe and that he does n’t bump into things or run out into the road			0
’ sometimes @entity1 is able to warn her when a seizure is about to happen because he gets a strange smell , known as an aura , or his face will turn red			1
many , however , are so brief that when he was younger it was not always obvious when he was having one			0
because of this , @entity1 was not formally diagnosed with focal epilepsy , where the excessive electrical activity that causes the seizure is concentrated on one part of the brain , until last september			1
he is now on anti-convulsion medication to try and control the number of seizures he has mrs @entity94 , hopes the drugs @entity1 is now on will have a greater effect over time			1
but mrs @entity94 said : “ he is very bright			2
“ they [ the doctors ] did n’t think he would do very much and would struggle with everything			2
‘ but from the moment he was born , i have been praying for that child			2
i feel so blessed to have him in my life			0
‘ he is such a character and he is so strong and very confident in himself			0
‘ he really is the sort of person who just gets on with it			0
we are so proud of him			0
’ mrs @entity94 is now trying to raise awareness of @entity246 , which has helped her cope with @entity1 ’s seizures			2
she has already raised more than £ 1,200 for the charity , after dying her hair purple last month			0
anyone wanting to help her cause can visit @entity252			0
