a 70 - year - old man in @entity1 has spent more than 40 years locked away in a @entity1 hospital for the criminally insane			1
his crime : stealing a necklace worth $ 20			0
@entity5 was sent to the psychiatric wing of @entity7 in 1971 after he was found not guilty by reason of insanity for stealing the necklace			2
six years ago , a public defender filed a motion asking a federal court to grant mr. @entity5 an unconditional release			1
in the motion , attorneys for mr. @entity5 cited his recovery over the last four decades he spent in psychiatric captivity as grounds for his release			1
@entity21 's case , however , is yet to be heard by a judge			2
psych ward : @entity24 has spent more than 40 years in the @entity7 's psychiatric facility for stealing a $ 20 necklace in what the @entity27 - which broke the story about mr. @entity5 after reviewing his case and federal court records - describes as ' a serious judicial breakdown , ' mr. @entity5 's case seems to have slipped through the cracks			1
according to the paper , the original judge assigned to mr. @entity5 's case died in 2007 - when the motion for mr. @entity5 's release was first filed			1
the case was n't transferred to a judge who is still breathing until the last few weeks			0
' mr. @entity5 has been waiting over five years to have this motion heard by the court , ' @entity40 , a lawyer now representing him , wrote in a jan. 8 legal filing			2
' mr. @entity5 was accused of stealing a necklace that was valued at approximately twenty dollars , ' ms. @entity40 continued in the motion			0
' he has been at @entity7 almost continuously since			0
' glacial pace : @entity21 's most recent motion for his release was filed six years ago - but is yet to be heard by a judge like @entity7 's most famous resident , @entity52 - the man who infamously shot president @entity53 in 1981 - mr. @entity5 has been permitted to spend short amounts of time out of the hospital			1
until december , he was part of an outpatient program at @entity58			0
that program ended because of funding problems - and mr. @entity5 was sent back to the psychiatric ward			0
@entity21 has filed several motions for his release over the last 40 years , including one two years after he was committed			2
in that motion , the hospital director recommended that mr. @entity5 be unconditionally released			0
the judge , however , approved a conditional release so mr. @entity5 could look for a job			2
' in the early years of mr. @entity5 â€™s hospitalization , mr. @entity5 would sometimes get in fights with other patients , often over money , food , clothing and the other hotly desired commodities of institutional life , ' ms. @entity40 wrote in her motion			0
' however , in the last decade , as mr. @entity5 has aged , these conflicts have all but vanished			0
now , nearly 70 , mr. @entity5 displays no dangerous behavior of any kind			0
' infamous : @entity52 , the man who shot president @entity53 , is also held at @entity7 in his latest motion , mr. @entity5 's attorneys reiterate the claims made in the 2008 motion that was never heard by a judge : ' mr. @entity5 has recovered his sanity and no longer suffers from a mental illness as defined by law			1
' just one day after @entity91 filed the most recent motion on @entity21 's behalf , his case was transferred to a living judge			1
it 's unclear when - or if - the judge will rule on the motion for mr. @entity5 's release .			1

@entity24 has been locked away in the @entity100 's psychiatric facility since 1971
