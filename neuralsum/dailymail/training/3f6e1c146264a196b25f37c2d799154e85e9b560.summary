despite concerns , @entity0 did receive a cbe in 1958 but was knighted only in 1971 , four years after homosexuality was eventually legalised the plays of sir @entity0 are known as tirades against what he saw as the sexual hypocrisy of the @entity9			1
now newly released papers reveal his homosexuality nearly cost him a place on the @entity14 and almost certainly delayed his knighthood			1
the word ‘ homo ’ was even written on documents concerning a recommendation that @entity0 – best known for @entity20 and separate tables – be included on the @entity22 of 1958			1
newly released papers reveal @entity0 's homosexuality nearly cost him a place on the @entity14 and almost certainly delayed his knighthood despite the concerns , @entity0 did receive a cbe in 1958 but was knighted only in 1971 , four years after homosexuality was eventually legalised			1
pictured with his mother ( left ) at @entity28 his case was recorded as causing ‘ difficulties ! ’ for civil servants and ‘ divided views ’ at a time when homosexuality was still illegal			0
experts last night said it was unlikely the reference to ‘ difficulties ’ and ‘ homo ’ could refer to anything other than @entity0 ’s private life			2
@entity42 , of the @entity43 , said : ‘ i do n’t see what other difficulties these people could have had in mind			0
he was n’t brazen about his sexuality because it was against the law			0
' but i do n’t think there was any question in the minds of people who knew him that he was gay			0
’ the papers , obtained by this newspaper under @entity59 , contain several redactions , and do not specify which honour @entity0 was being considered for			1
but the letters ‘ @entity2 ’ have been scribbled next to his name , implying that he may have initially been recommended for a knighthood but then downgraded			0
despite the concerns , @entity0 did receive a cbe in 1958 but was knighted only in 1971 , four years after homosexuality was eventually legalised			1
@entity66 ( @entity67 ) and @entity68 ( @entity69 ) in @entity70 by @entity0 in any other circumstances , @entity0 , who was 46 in 1958 , would appear to have been an obvious choice for an honour , given his long list of stage and screen successes			1
but his recommendation came at a time when homosexuality was still illegal and public opinion remained bitterly divided on the issue			0
in the late 1950s , as many as 1,000 men a year were being jailed for the offence , with high - profile convictions including actor @entity85 and motor museum founder @entity86 of @entity87			0
@entity88 , author of the book @entity0 : the man and his work , said : ‘ the police were beginning to crack down on anyone who spoke out in favour of a relaxation of a law			2
@entity97 ( as @entity98 , centre ) in a film adaptation of @entity20 ' you can imagine , in that climate , officials would have thought twice about honouring someone who was homosexual			0
’ @entity0 had numerous lovers but no long - term partner and his sexuality would have been no secret to his friends or theatrical peers			2
it is possible officials may have put their initial concerns to one side in 1958 following the publication of the @entity116 in 1957 which recommended that the laws on same - sex relationships should be reformed			2
@entity0 died in 1977 , but revivals of his work have included a 2011 @entity122 production of @entity70 , starring @entity66 and @entity68 , and the @entity124 ’s acclaimed 2010 production of after the dance , with @entity126			0
a movie version of @entity0 ’s play @entity128 , starring @entity129 , was released in 2011 .			1
