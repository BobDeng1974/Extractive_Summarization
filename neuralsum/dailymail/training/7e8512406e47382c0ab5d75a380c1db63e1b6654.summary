@entity1 subway cars are the last thing you 'd expect to come across in the vast , harsh expanse of the @entity5			1
but along the coast - from @entity7 to @entity8 - a subsea network of these colossal vehicles has become home to millions of fish			2
now , photographer @entity13 has captured the transformation of ordinary subway cars into exotic artificial reefs in a series of stunning images			1
along the coast , from @entity7 to @entity8 , a subsea network of these colossal vehicles have become home to millions of tiny fish ' seeing these massive mechanisms being tossed into the ocean like a toy in the bathtub is a ping in my heart , ' mr @entity13 writes			1
' at first i was stunned , the moments of violent recycling , watching the water quickly adapt to its new underwater houses			0
' after being pushed and stacked like a sardine in these subways cars over the past decade , it is nice to see the sardine actually getting one of these as its new steel condo			1

photographer @entity13 has been able to capture the process of transforming the city 's subway cars into artificial coral reefs ' seeing these massive mechanisms being tossed into the ocean like a toy in the bathtub is a ping in my heart , ' mr @entity13 said ' at first i was stunned , the moments of violent recycling , watching the water quickly adapt to its new underwater houses , ' he added the images show the cars being dumped into the ocean using a hydraulic lift ( left ) like huge anchors , churning waves in their wake the ' @entity41 ' project saw the @entity1 photographer capture four ' drops ' and two ' load - ups ' in a project spanning three years			1
a coral reef in @entity71 severely damaged by warming seas has managed to completely heal itself in just 12 years , stunned researchers have found			0
the research in 2013 showed that an isolated reef off the northwest coast of @entity71 that was severely damaged by a period of warming in 1998			0
it was hit by coral bleaching , caused by higher water temperatures that break down the coral 's symbiotic relationship with algae that provide food for coral growth			0
however , the team found @entity89 reef has regenerated in a very short time to become nearly as healthy as it was before			0
the discovery raises hope that other damaged reefs could ' regenerate ' the 18 - ton stainless steel cars - minus wheels , windows and doors - are stacked two - high on a barge where a bucket crane with a specially designed hydraulic lift picks them up one by one			1
the images show the cars being dumped into the ocean like huge anchors			2
while it may appear like an act of pollution , it is in fact the opposite			0
after four decades carrying millions of @entity1 , these subway cars are now home to millions of sea life			1
' the @entity116 's recycling program has been involved for the past decade , retiring over 2500 subways cars to the ocean to help rebuild underwater reefs along the eastern seabed , ' the @entity1 photographer explains			1
' these are my images , seconds before these mass transit vessels join history in building homes for life under the sea			2
' the reefs attract fish because they provide protection from predators , and generate food like mussels , shrimp and crabs that quickly colonise the structure			2
about 95 per cent of the seabed off the @entity139 mid-atlantic coast is naturally bare sand , which is much less likely to attract fish			0
officials hope the new reefs will become home to such inshore species as black sea bass , tautog and summer flounder			2
these in turn should attract game like marlin , tuna and dolphin			0
overall , corals are estimated to generate $ 200 million ( £ 131 million ) annually in the @entity139 mr @entity13 's images will be on display at @entity157 's @entity156 from february 6th to march 15 , 2015			0

photographer , @entity13 , followed process of transforming subway cars into artificial coral reefs
the 18 - ton stainless steel cars - minus wheels , windows and doors - are stacked two - high on a barge
a crane with a special hydraulic lift then picks them up one by one , and drops them to the ocean floor
here , the retired subway cars become home for a variety of sea life *including* mussels , shrimp and crab
