this season we 've played against sides form the @entity60 in the cups , against teams from @entity63 , and @entity5 from @entity6 , but the most aggressive team was @entity1			1

' what is domination ? if that means chances , then yes			0

if moving the ball with aggression , yes they dominated			0
so they dominated in everything except the result			0
