it started as an easy way to pay to park a car when you ran out of coins , or a strategy to avoid long queues as bus drivers desperately searched for change			2
. but now the system of paying to park using your mobile phone , follow the trend of using passes instead of cash on buses , could be the latest sign that @entity17 is moving towards a cashless system			1
@entity19 and @entity20 has announced it will scrap half of its coin operated parking meters in favour of people using their phones to pay for and top up their car parking			1
this is already used on buses across the country where cash is no longer accepted , and particularly in @entity47 , as well as in a number of work canteens that operate card - only systems of payment			1
the popularity of non-cash payments has also been seen on the streets with an unemployed man travelling to @entity56 armed with a card machine so people can give him money using their cards			1
@entity17 is on track to make more non-cash payments - defined as paying by card , cheque , direct debit , standing order and mobile phone - than cash for the first time in 2015 , according to predictions by the @entity71			1
this year non-cash transactions are expected to reach 19.9billion , outstripping the predicted 19billion cash exchanges			2
this is forecast to happen at some point in 2015because while cash payments are remaining fairly constant , the number of non-cash payments has been steadily increasing			1
the growth in online shopping and the rise of new , innovative ways to pay have led to consumers turning to a growing range of payment options in recent years			2
some have predicted the end of coin - operated marking meters ( right ) could spell the end of cash about three - quarters of @entity17 now shop online , compared with just over half in 2008 , according to @entity91 ( @entity91 ) figures released last year			1
in @entity19 councillors have decided to remove half of its coin - operated parking meters because of the popularity of doing this through mobile phones and the ease of its use			1
the move by @entity19 follows similar methods such as only accepting payments by card and oyster card on buses in @entity47 ( left ) as well as the launch of the @entity110 ( right ) @entity111 , a transport councillor in @entity19 , said : ' it 's actually a lot easier than messing about getting the right change			1
you can also top up your parking time remotely if you need to stay longer , which is a lot easier than walking back to the car			1
' and @entity120 travels 200 miles every day to @entity56 in @entity47 to sit outside an @entity47 restaurant and beg , using his wireless card machine			0
the 37 - year - old travels by bus , train or rental car from @entity128 in @entity129 to @entity56 and spends thursdays to sundays taking cash from passers - by and card payments from ' regulars '			1
@entity120 , 37 , commutes from @entity128 to @entity47 to beg in @entity56 armed with his own chip and machine , and is pictured here taking money from @entity137 and offering him a sweet in return contactless payments have also had a significant boost in the last year , with £ 2.32 billion spent using the method in 2014			2
this was more than three times the total value of contactless spending the previous year			0
contactless payments can be used on transactions worth up to £ 20 , and the limit is due to be increased to £ 30			2
and in another move towards getting rid of cash , @entity147 has launched a ' ping - it ' app where people can make payments in a similar way to sending a text message			1
the bank also revealed it is developing pairs of contactless ' tap and pay ' gloves , which people can use by swiping the back of their hand on the reader at the till , in a similar way to making contactless card payments			2
@entity120 , 37 , is believed to be on @entity167 ( @entity167 ) for his depression , which could earn him up to £ 108 a week			0
the government allows @entity167 to be paid to people of working age who are too ill to work because of a health condition or disability			0
you must be under state pension age , not getting statutory sick pay or statutory maternity pay and not receiving any jobseeker 's allowance			0
in order to qualify you will have be assessed and after that can earn another £ 104 a week on top of your benefits for certain types of work			0
but mr @entity120 's begging - which is illegal in @entity17 and punishable by a £ 1,000 fine - could be considered benefit fraud			0
the @entity188 told @entity189 it never comments on individual cases			0
however a spokesman said : ' benefit fraud is a crime and our fraud investigaters will look into all suspected cases			0
' if you suspect someone of claiming benefits fraudulently you can report it to the @entity201 on @entity202 0800 854 440 '			0
@entity203 , head of policy at the @entity205 , said : ' instead of having pockets full of coins or carrying wads of notes , people are increasingly choosing their cards instead			0
' three in every four pounds spent in @entity17 shops is now paid with cards and we 're all using them for smaller purchases too			0
' it 's the rise in convenient contactless payments for lower sums and smaller transactions online which in particular are changing the way we choose to pay			0
' and the amount we spend with cash is dwindling too , with the @entity226 estimating we now spend an average of £ 9.47 in coins and notes			0
however the @entity71 said the popularity of cashless payments do not spell the end of @entity17 's monetary system in its entirety			1
while card and other non cash payments will continue to become popular , the council predicts that by 2023 we will still be making 12.9 transactions using coins and notes			1
this will be significantly lower than the 27.5 billion transactions without cash that are expected			0
@entity243 , a spokesman for the @entity71 , said cash is still a vital payment method for many consumers , with students , people who need to tightly control their budgets , older people and people with a disability being particularly high users of cash			1
he said : ' we are not forecasting that cash will disappear			0
' cash is widely used for day - to - day purchases by virtually everyone and for some people ( around 3.5 million ) cash is the only method that is used			2

@entity19 and @entity20 is scrapping half of its coin - fed parking meters
the authority is latest to follow growing trend for cashless payments
it says scrapping machines will save money and make it easier for drivers
buses across country no longer accept cash , while canteens want cards
@entity71 predicts non-cash payments will overtake cash in 2015
