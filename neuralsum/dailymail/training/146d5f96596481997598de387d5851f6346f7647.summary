by @entity0 published : 07:46 est , 6 march 2013 updated : 05:50 est , 7 march 2013 @entity1 has lost nearly half her body weight thanks to a ' fat controller ' - a mock dvd - style zapper that makes her stop and think about what she is eating			1
the humanitarian worker , 32 , ballooned to more than 16 - and - a - half stone eating ' trucker - sized ' portions late at night			0
but after discovering @entity11 early last year single @entity1 claims to have dropped an incredible six stones - around 40 per cent of her weight			1
@entity1 lost a third of her body weight - six stone - in six months using @entity11 the treatment features hypnotherapy and other cognitive programmes combined with a mock credit card - sized controller or wristband			1
it has imaginary play , fast forward , rewind and pause buttons which users are taught to ' operate ' to consider the consequences of eating unhealthy food			1
@entity1 said : ' the @entity11 device i have is a small card that slips into your wallet - it 's just a simple aide memoir - you do n't need batteries			1
' it does n't have any moving parts			0
it just prompts you to stop and think about the ramifications of what you are about to do			0
the @entity11 device is a credit card - sized prompter featuring mock play , fast forward , rewind and pause buttons ' " the wonder is , it lasts for ever - you need to reinforce using it to begin with , so the first few weeks you tend to physically use it , as in take it out of your pocket and imagine pressing the button			1
' now , i do n't even use the card - it 's become practice for me to stop and imagine pressing the button , without the prompt			2
' of course , there are always times when i should have used it - but did n't it			0
but the difference is , i recognise them now			0
' @entity1 , currently living and working in the @entity64 , was in @entity65 when she began researching ways to lose weight in march 2012			1
she had reached 16 - and - a - half - stone and was desperate to get down to a much healthier weight			2
@entity1 , originally from @entity70 , @entity71 , would go all day without eating but plough through heavy meals late in the evening			1
a friend recommended @entity11 - a combination of @entity76 and hypnotherapy			1
the Â£ 1,400 course involved discussions on the psychology of @entity11 where the subject is talked through the reasons for their weight gain and their ' triggers ' for unhealthy eating			1
they are followed by 20 minute hypnosis sessions which drum home the need to eat slowly and in a more considered way , when to eat and thinking of the consequences			2
once the course is complete the clinic hands over the dvd - style remote control so the patient can use the pause button to buy them time while they put @entity11 into practice			1
@entity1 had the treatment during four visits to @entity102 in @entity103 , @entity104 , run by @entity105 and @entity106 , the pioneers of @entity11			1
the fast forward button on the device takes the dieter forward to imagine the future consequences via different scenarios			1
@entity1 added : ' it sounds really simple , and it is - but it really helped me to take my time			1
' i was definitely eating automatically before , without thinking , and sometimes i could n't tell you what i 'd eaten for lunch for example			0
i 'd just eaten - without thinking			0
the principle behind @entity11 is that it teaches the dieter to think about the consequences of eating unhealthy food			1
@entity125 says : ' it helped me to take my time			0
i was eating automatically before , without thinking			0
' ' is it as simple as just pressing a button - it 's easier , you do n't even need to press the button if you do n't want to			0
' i also used stop and forward or rewind to help me think about consequences			2
' you press it for literally seconds , just to make sure the decision you make is conscious , not automatic and not a ' reflex '			0
i think i was a reflex eater before			0
' when i pressed rewind , usually in the mornings , i imagined listening to @entity105 's advice to always eat breakfast			0
' i started losing weight in march and lost a healthy two pounds or so a week			1
it was really even , and really easy			0
' by september , just six months later , i weighed 10 - and - a - half stone			0
' ' it has made my life better			0
i enjoy food now without the guilt , i feel healthier , i have so much more energy and i had to buy an entire new wardrobe			2
' @entity106 says she came up with the idea for @entity11 using the concept of a tv remote control			2
she said : ' i noticed clients benefited from having a tactile device , to help them engage in taking responsibility for their actions			0
' @entity11 is such a simple concept it can help with many behavioural issues - from anger management to thumb - sucking , from road rage to overcoming addictions			2
' promoting positive choices : @entity106 one of the pioneers of @entity11 came up with the idea using the concept of a tv remote control			2
