an employment tribunal heard that @entity9 and his wife allegedly paid @entity11 , a @entity12 , and @entity13 , an @entity14 , less than minimum wage and denied them holiday pay			1
they also allegedly failed to give them a statement of particulars of employment and an itemised pay statement			0
immunity : @entity24 may not have to answer claims against him because he is a member of the @entity2 diplomatic mission in the @entity27 , whose @entity29 embassy is pictured both women say that they were trafficked , and had letters from the @entity32 which said there were ' reasonable grounds to believe ' that this was the case			1
however , mr @entity9 and his wife may not have to answer the claims after winning an appeal which allows them to claim diplomatic immunity			1
ms @entity11 worked at the @entity42 's home from 18 january 2011 until 14 march 2011 , and ms @entity43 from 16 may 2011 until 19 september 2011			0
