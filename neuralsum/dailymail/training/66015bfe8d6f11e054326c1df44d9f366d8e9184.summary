@entity1 boss @entity0 insists the club 's efforts to strengthen over the summer in which they have lost @entity6 should not be compared to the case of @entity8 and @entity9 from a year ago			1
@entity10 departed @entity8 to join @entity11 for a gargantuan fee and the @entity14 outfit splashed out on a raft of new players ahead of the 2013/14 campaign , but many of them subsequently struggled to make an impact			1
forward @entity6 followed @entity9 in making a mega-money switch to @entity22 by signing for @entity23 in july , by which time @entity1 had already been spending significantly on new players and have continued to do so			1
how it all comes together remains to be seen , but @entity0 , whose side face @entity8 away in the @entity30 on sunday , is feeling optimistic about his restructured squad			1
and asked about his confidence that @entity1 will not suffer the problems @entity8 have @entity43 , the @entity40 said : ' i think it is totally different circumstances			2
' @entity8 were a strong squad , had a top , world - class player in @entity9 and they will have their reasons for bringing in their players			1
' for us , i think it is pretty obvious we were very low in terms of our numbers and that quality and depth			0
' so , irrespective of @entity6 staying or going , it was something we had to do and i 'm very glad we did it , because i look at the quality in our training and it has gone up a level			0
@entity63 : @entity36 international @entity35 ( r ) is one of nine new arrivals at @entity66 this summer one in , one out : @entity67 was signed in a £ 20million deal from @entity69 , while @entity70 has left ' i see the hunger that the young players coming into the squad have given and the boost that has given the senior players as well			2
' i think it is different circumstances , but obviously over the course of the coming years we will see			0
' while @entity8 could only finish sixth last term , @entity1 , who thrashed them 5 - 0 at @entity82 and then 4 - 0 at @entity66 during the campaign , surprised many by comfortably securing a @entity87 berth and going close to claiming the @entity30 title , eventually coming second			1
back in the @entity90 competition for the first time since 2009 , the @entity32 discovered on thursday that they are set to come up against @entity9 , having been drawn with defending champions real in @entity93 same again ? @entity94 ( c ) scores one of nine goals that @entity1 put past @entity8 last season training day : @entity99 ( @entity100 ) prepares for @entity1 's visit to @entity82 on sunday @entity0 , who will be in charge of @entity1 for a 100th competitive game on sunday , is relishing the prospect of taking on the @entity106 giants			1
he said : ' it was great on thursday for the supporters and is great that @entity1 are back in their rightful place in the @entity87			2
' they are two clubs that are very special - you are looking at 15 - times winners between the two ( five times for @entity1 , 10 for @entity11 ) , which is incredible			2
' there is no doubt it felt good on thursday and must have been great for everyone connected with @entity1 to watch the draw '			0
certainly @entity1 skipper @entity119 , who won the @entity87 with the club in 2005 , was an excited viewer on thursday			1
' it was massive - i planned my whole day around the @entity87 draw , i had friends and family round and we had it on the television , ' @entity119 told liverpoolfc.com			2
' we could n't wait for it , it was so exciting			0
i 've missed it so much			0
there 's almost a jealousy when you watch the @entity87 and you 're not involved in it			0
glory nights : @entity119 ( r ) is excited by the prospect of playing @entity11 in the @entity87 turning back the clock : @entity119 scored when @entity1 beat @entity11 4 - 0 at @entity66 in 2009 ' they ( @entity11 ) were one of the sides that all of the players wanted , and certainly the supporters			1
' for us , it 's a chance to go and compete against the best			0
' we 're not in this competition to make the numbers up , we 're not celebrating and going out to enjoy this competition - we want to compete and go as far as we can			0
