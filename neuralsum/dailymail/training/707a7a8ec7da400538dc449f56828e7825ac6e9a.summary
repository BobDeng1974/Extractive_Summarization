if @entity1 ordered the assassination of @entity3 on @entity5 soil it could badly damage diplomatic relations by @entity7 last updated at 7:40 pm on 13th october 2011 the widow of murdered @entity1 dissident @entity3 today welcomed a coroner 's pledge to question the secret services over his killing			1
dr @entity13 today ruled there should be a full 7/7 - style inquest into the death of the 43 - year - old from radiation poisoning			0
mr @entity3 's widow , @entity19 , said the decision was ' very important ' to her because it meant the inquest would examine allegations that the @entity1 state was involved in the killing			1
if the inquest finds that @entity1 had ordered the assassination on @entity5 soil , it could have huge ramifications on diplomatic relations between the two countries			1
relief : @entity3 , the murdered dissident 's widow , pictured today , said she was pleased the inquest would look at @entity1 involvement in the death dr @entity13 , the @entity38 , also announced he would ask the @entity39 and intelligence agencies @entity41 and @entity42 to carry out further inquiries			1
he said he would decide at a later date whether he would hold the inquest himself or ask for a senior judge to be appointed			0
former @entity47 agent mr @entity3 , 43 , fell ill shortly after drinking tea during a meeting at a @entity51 hotel with former contacts and died in @entity54 's @entity53 on november 23 , 2006			2
prosecutors have named fellow ex-kgb agent @entity56 as the main suspect in his murder , but the @entity1 authorities have repeatedly refused to send him to face trial in the @entity5			1
under @entity5 law , a dead person 's family has the right to an inquest into a suspicious death			2
this often goes beyond the medical cause to examine more widely the circumstances of how the death occurred			0
an inquest was opened and adjourned in 2006 , but it has been claimed that said the @entity74 and police officials tried to discourage @entity76 from reopening it because they feared , respectively , that it would further damage relations with @entity80 and reduce the already remote prospects for a trial			1
last month , @entity1 said it was prepared to investigate the murder but wanted it to be in a court in their country not in @entity5			1
a leaked @entity88 document also showed a @entity1 official said shortly after the death they had been tracking the assassins but @entity5 had stopped it			1
@entity94 , for mrs @entity3 , told the court the full hearing must consider whether it was a state - sanctioned murder - and also look at the role of the @entity5 security services			1
he said : ' did @entity1 murder @entity3 is a question that this inquest , if it is going to do anything in the public interest , has got to be in a position to answer			1
' did @entity41 and @entity42 have material in their possession which could have saved him and failed in their duties is also a question that it must be in a position to answer			0
' finally , it must dispel the insulting suggestions of suicide and the involvement of the @entity5 security services that are being raised by mr @entity56 as a smokescreen to hide his guilt			2
' murdered : @entity3 , pictured left before the poisoning and right in his hospital bed , died from radiation poisoning in 2006 mr @entity121 said the poisoning of mr @entity3 using radioactive polonium - 210 was a case of ' nuclear terrorism on the streets of @entity54 '			2
the barrister also told the hearing in north @entity54 that 97 per cent of the world 's legally produced polonium - 210 came from a site in @entity1			2
@entity1 president @entity131 insisted during a visit to @entity80 by prime minister @entity133 last month that suspect mr @entity56 - now a @entity1 mp - would never be extradited to @entity5			1
mr @entity56 , who denies all involvement , suggested through his lawyer today that mr @entity3 may have killed himself			0
@entity138 told the hearing on his behalf : ' the scope should be wide			0
it should enable and allow the coroner to investigate the relevant issues so as to dispel the numerous allegations of mr @entity56 's involvement			0
' in particular the inquest should be able to consider all other possibilities , including death by misadventure and suicide			0
' we do not accept that there is an indisputable verdict of unlawful killing in this case			0
' probe : a police cordon is put up outside @entity3 's north @entity54 home following the poisoning five years ago @entity160 , for the @entity161 , argued in favour of a narrower remit for the inquest			1
he told the coroner : ' there is simply nothing before you to suggest that the bringing of polonium - 210 into this country or its use on mr @entity3 was something that any public authority here might have prevented			0
' dr @entity13 said it seemed ' inconceivable ' that mr @entity3 , as a former member of the @entity1 security services who was granted first asylum and then citizenship by the @entity5 , was not ' on the radar ' of @entity41 or @entity42			1
mr @entity184 said he could neither confirm nor deny whether the @entity5 intelligence services held any relevant documents			0
speaking outside court after the hearing , mrs @entity3 said she was pleased the coroner would carry out a broad investigation into the death			2
' i was waiting for this almost five years since my husband died			0
today i actually received a very important decision , ' she said			0
' the coroner has said there will be a wide inquest into my husband 's death			0
it will therefore include an investigation into the involvement of the @entity1 state in his murder , which is exactly what i want			2

if @entity1 ordered the assassination of @entity3 on @entity5 soil it could badly damage diplomatic relations
last month officials said they was prepared to investigate the murder but wanted it to be in a @entity1 court not in @entity5
government *wrangling* means that the inquest has been *delayed* by five years
