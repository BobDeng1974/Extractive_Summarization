@entity0 bounced back from their recent 4 - 2 derby defeat by easing to victory against @entity3			1
an own goal by @entity5 and @entity8 's 20th @entity7 strike of the season was enough to give @entity0 the three points			1
here , @entity12 's @entity11 rates the players ' performances at the @entity15			0
@entity0 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity18 6 - the @entity17 goalkeeper could n’t have wished for a quieter 28th birthday , and was rarely called into action by a toothless @entity3			1
@entity21 6.5 – treated for bloody nose early on but that was about the extent of the damage inflicted on @entity0			2
got forward well as usual			0
@entity0 right back @entity21 keeps @entity26 at bay by putting in a crunching challenge @entity29 6 – careless slip let in @entity31 in the first half but otherwise looked relatively comfortable alongside a new defensive partner in @entity34			1
@entity34 7 - dominant display from @entity0 ’s £ 32million defender who was able to enjoy a trouble - free return to the line - up , and snuffed out the few threats offered by the @entity3			1
@entity40 6.5 – went close with slightly deflected freekick and another effort from a tight angle in the second half			0
defensively , faced little threat from @entity46			0
@entity47 6 – only his fifth @entity7 start for @entity0 and of lack match sharpness showed on occasions as his touch let him down			2
@entity0 midfielder @entity47 was given a rare chance to impress by starting against @entity3 @entity53 6.5 – did n’t have too much on his plate but was alert to track @entity57 ’s burst from midfield in the first half and produced a fantastic interception tackle			1
@entity61 8 – much better from the little @entity62			2
more direct and looked for an earlier pass , which contributed to both of @entity0 ’s first two goals			2
@entity61 played a major role in @entity0 's two goals at the @entity15 @entity68 7 – a more lively display than of late from the much - maligned @entity70 who passed the ball well and his interception started the move for @entity0 ’s second goal			1
@entity76 6.5 – subdued display despite going close with a couple of efforts , and stretchered off following lengthy treatment after taking an elbow to the head from @entity57			0
@entity8 7.5 – the @entity84 ’s third goal in two games took his total to 26 for the season , and the top of the @entity7 scoring charts with 20			1
ca n’t argue with that			0
@entity8 celebrates with @entity0 team - mates @entity61 and @entity68 after putting his side 2 - 0 up @entity0 ace @entity8 wheels away in celebration after scoring his 20th @entity7 goal subs : @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 ( for @entity47 88 ) , @entity101 ( for @entity102 , 6 ) , @entity103 ( for @entity8 90 +1 ) , @entity104			1
scorers : @entity5 og 18 , @entity8 36 booked : @entity61 , @entity102 @entity3 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) @entity107 6 – had little chance with either of @entity0 ’s goals , particularly @entity5 ’s own - goal which looped over his head and in off the underside of the bar			1
@entity114 6 – one of @entity3 ’s better defenders and produced an excellent interception to deny @entity8 an almost certain goal in the second half			1
@entity5 5 – wo n’t enjoy seeing a replay of his freakish own - goal			2
almost redeemed himself with a great block on @entity102 – but not quite			0
@entity3 centre back @entity5 diverted the ball past @entity107 to give @entity0 an early lead @entity127 5.5 – did his best to hold @entity0 at bay but guilty of an awful dive in the dying stages that was thankfully ignored by the referee and ridiculed by the @entity0 fans			1
@entity133 5.5 – after his goalscoring exploits against @entity135 last weekend , had a difficult afternoon up against @entity136 and struggled to cope at times			0
@entity137 5 – had his hands full trying to screen @entity3 ’s defence against the blue tide in the first half and replaced by @entity142 as @entity143 tried to salvage something in the second			2
@entity137 , pictured with @entity47 , was replaced by manager @entity143 in the 66th minute @entity146 kouyate 6 – his arm into @entity102 ’s face was the talking point of a dull game			0
it seemed to be more careless than malicious but @entity0 may think otherwise			2
@entity154 – overrun in midfield and was able to offer his team very little			0
struggled tpo get into the game at all			0
@entity159 4.5 – lost the ball in the build - up to @entity0 ’s second goal and that summed up his performance			1
below - par and lacked any impact at all			0
@entity166 6 – @entity167 in the first half but picked up a bit after the interval and had @entity3 ’s best effort with a fine individual run and shot			2
@entity174 cole 4.5 – was gifted the @entity3 ’ best opportunity in the first half but took too long to get a shot off			0
struggled with little service and replaced by @entity178			0
@entity31 failed to impress on his first start since his side 's 0 - 0 draw with @entity182 in february subs : @entity184 66 , 6 ) , @entity142 ( for @entity185 , 6 ) , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190			1
booked : @entity57 , @entity159 referee : @entity192 6.5 @entity193 man : @entity61			0

@entity0 bounced back from derby defeat with 2 - 0 win over @entity3
@entity8 scored his 20th league goal of the season during victory
@entity61 impressed on the right - hand side of @entity0 's midfield
@entity206 's side have moved to within one point of rivals united
