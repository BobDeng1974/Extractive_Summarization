by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 07:35 est , 11 april 2013 updated : 02:41 est , 14 april 2013 @entity2 , leader of the @entity4 group on the @entity5 , claimed @entity6 caused ' great harm ' to @entity8 @entity9 yesterday led calls for a statue of @entity6 to be erected in @entity12			1
the major of @entity8 suggested a permanent memorial to @entity6 should be placed alongside other prominent figures , including @entity16			1
his comments came after @entity18 said the fourth plinth in @entity20 – the previous forerunner for the site – was being reserved for the @entity23			0
mr @entity9 said that ‘ it is right that she should be properly commemorated ’			1
he added that he has instructed @entity27 officials to find ‘ the right kind of place ’ in the capital to erect a statue			2
he said : ‘ people say put it on the fourth plinth – i think we ’ve been around that a lot			0
actually , there are better sites than that			0
i think we should look at @entity12			0
‘ there are other places in the heart of the capital that would do very well			0
’ but @entity4 today dismissed the idea of using the scene of poll tax riots as ' crass triumphalism ' , claiming @entity6 ' great harm to many people in @entity8 '			1
@entity50 today said he wanted to ' take some time ' before any decisions are made on a permanent monument to the former @entity54 premier who died on monday aged 87			1
mr @entity9 's support of the idea of a statue has been publicly backed by former military personnel who served in the victorious @entity61 campaign in 1982			1
the @entity8 mayor has ordered staff to start looking for a suitable site in the captial			1
but @entity2 , leader of the @entity67 on the @entity5 , said : ' i do n’t think it is appropriate to have a statue of @entity6 on the fourth plinth in @entity20			2
' she was a significant figure , but she was a divisive figure			0
' i would argue that @entity6 did great harm to many people in @entity8 , and to place a statue of her at the site of the @entity79 riots , which symbolised just how divisive she was , would be crass triumphalism			1
' he went on : ' @entity9 needs to think carefully about this , rather than just jumping on a bandwagon			1
we all know he is trying to increase his standing within the @entity54 , but abusing his position as @entity88 for purely internal party political ends would demean him , the office of mayor and our great city			0
' this would also mean the fourth plinth would not be available for future artworks , which has been hugely successful and popular			0
' supporters of @entity6 are calling for a permanent statue to be erected on the fourth plinth in @entity20 @entity50 said there would be ' lots of memorials ' to @entity6 amid a growing clamour for a statue to be placed in central @entity8 on public view , mr @entity50 confirmed there would be numerous tributes			1
he told @entity107 : ' i think there will be lots of memorials			1
i think we should take some time and think about this to make sure we get it right			0
' using the vacant plinth in the shadow of @entity119 's column in @entity20 , at the opposite end of @entity121 from the @entity122 , has been backed by senior ministers			0
however , there are concerns that any memorial could become the target of vandals and protests , after police clashed with revellers at hate - filled street parties ‘ celebrating ’ @entity6 ’s death on monday at the age of 87			2
there is already a statue of the former @entity54 leader in the member ’s lobby outside the main doors to the chamber of the @entity142			2
@entity8 mayor @entity9 ( left ) and defence secretary @entity143 have given their backing to the idea of a permanent memorial in central @entity8 when the 7ft 6in statue was unveiled in 2007 , @entity6 was the first living former prime minister to be honoured in such a way by the commons however , in 2002 a marble statue of the three - times election winner was decapitated after it went on show at @entity8 ’ ’s @entity154			1
theatre producer @entity155 was jailed for three months after attacking the £ 150,000 work of art. the court heard that when police arrived minutes after the vandalism , @entity155 said : ‘ i think it looks better like that			2
’ ministers backed the idea of a statue which could act as a long - lasting tribute to @entity6			1
mr @entity143 said : ‘ i think it would be very appropriate to have a memorial to @entity6 somewhere in @entity8			1
‘ i have n’t personally given any thought yet to where that should be , but certainly the fourth plinth could be one of the options			0
let ’s look at that in slower time , i think these things are better thought about in slightly slower time after the event			0
’ write caption here @entity50 ’s official spokesman yesterday said the prime minister thought it was a ‘ good idea to think of ways of how in due course @entity6 can be best commemorated ’			2
the @entity8 mayor ’s office also revealed mr @entity9 ’s office is now exploring options of a site for a statue			1
a spokesman for the @entity194 said : ‘ the mayor believes @entity6 deserves a prominent statue in a central @entity8 location and his team will assist with exploring suitable options			1
’ @entity200 said that using the plinth in @entity20 would enable @entity119 to ' keep an eye on ' @entity6 the fourth plinth in @entity20 has remained unfilled , but since 1998 has been used to showcase a rotating collection of artworks			0
since @entity6 ’s death from a stroke was announced on monday , the plinth has become the focus of calls for a permanent statue			2
@entity212 , a lt commander on the @entity213 during the @entity214 , said : ‘ let 's have a full scale statue next to @entity119 to recognise that she was at the heart of the nation			2
she was a great @entity221 , let 's put her at the centre			0
former @entity54 party chairman @entity200 added : ' i think it would be appropriate for her to be honoured publicly in the centre of @entity8			2
she could be in @entity20 , where @entity119 could keep an eye on her			0
' @entity54 mp @entity228 , who visited @entity6 weekly , said the statue in the @entity231 already served to highlight her political impact			0
‘ i always say to young people when we go around @entity237 , there are only two prime ministers of the twentieth century who are not wartime leaders who have statues in members ’ lobby , they are @entity245 and @entity6 - arguably the only two prime ministers of the twentieth century to use their office to fundamentally try and change the country they governed , and i think that might inspire some young people			0
