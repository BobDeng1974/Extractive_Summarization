@entity1 videos have a tried and tested format : shaky footage , a bogus spaceship and cries of wonder from the person filming on a smartphone			0
but one @entity10 animator has gone the extra mile to produce a convincing @entity1 ' gag ' which is entirely created with @entity14 effects - including the car , the skies and the scenery			2
@entity19 @entity18 , who has worked on @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 : @entity23 , created a short clip which appears to show a @entity1 flying over @entity25 , @entity26 , seen from a moving vehicle			1
the driver can be heard muttering ' @entity43 ' , before getting out of the car in the breeze to get a better shot of the apparent @entity1			0
it hovers around some pylons before a ' mothership ' appears from nowhere , collects the @entity1 and vanishes , at which the driver says : ' @entity51 ... ' @entity18 , who spent four months creating the 30 second clip , said he wanted to play a joke to prove to critics of @entity14 that the effects can look realistic			1
the 45 - year - old director told @entity57 : ' the point of the video was to prove that @entity14 can look natural and convincing			1
' everybody assumes the background and car are real , and that the @entity63 are probably fake , especially the over-the - top mothership at the end			0
@entity14 effects show the driver pulling over to get a better shot of the @entity1 as it hovers by electricity pylons @entity18 described the mothership as being ' over-the - top ' but deliberately made the video shaky to seem more realistic ' the general reaction is disbelief , so i usually have to prove it by showing a wire frame of the entire shot to prove that nothing is real			1
' @entity18 said the ' real ' elements to the film were the most difficult to create convincingly			2
the @entity83 - based director said : ' without a doubt the real stuff was the toughest because everybody knows what an actual car driving down a desert should look like			2
' getting it mostly right was n’t good enough			0
we had to nail the car and desert perfectly , otherwise the gag would n’t work			0
getting the car , the scenery and the exposure right was vital to making the video realistic even the scenery was completely computer generated for the 30 - second ufo hoax clip the exposure was made to look imperfect in order to mimic the settings on an ordinary smartphone ' @entity14 is too perfectly and uniformly exposed , when reality has things blowing out or falling into darkness all over the place			1
' the car interior was a beautiful model , but i deliberately crunched down that element in the composite until it was almost entirely black , because a real camera would do the same if exposing for the sky			0
' @entity18 worked on the hoax with students from the @entity119 , where he taught filmmaking classes and served as resident director of an original content division called @entity123 .			1

director and animator @entity18 worked on @entity20 and @entity22
he spent four months creating 30 second clip to prove @entity14 looks ' natural '
