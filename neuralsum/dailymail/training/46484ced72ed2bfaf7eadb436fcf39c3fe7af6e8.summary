by @entity0 a cat from the @entity2 has mysteriously turned up 2,000 miles away in a @entity4 fishing village leaving locals utterly baffled as to how she got there			1
the wandering moggy , who has been nicknamed @entity10 , was found cowering in a garage in the village of @entity13 , @entity14 , on thursday morning			1
@entity15 , 66 , found the distressed tabby while putting her car away after a day trip with her husband @entity19			2
littlest hobo : but just how did @entity10 , pictured with her finder @entity15 , make it from the @entity2 to a @entity4 fishing village in @entity14 ? they assumed she was a neighbours and took her to the vets to have her @entity28 chip scanned - where they found out she had been registered on the sunshine island of @entity31			1
@entity15 explained : ' we imagined if she had a microchip then we would maybe find an address in @entity13 and we could take her back to her owners			1
' but when we scanned her it was the @entity2 - we could n’t quite believe it			0
' the cat is so young - under a year old			0
for someone to have brought her over from the @entity2 they must have paid a fair bit			0
' it just seems a total mystery			0
' mystery : a microchip scan revealed the young female tabby had been registered on the sunshine island of @entity31 the cat ’s @entity28 chip was tracked down to the @entity51 database - but with no information how she had made the 2,000 mile trip @entity19 had been up at 6am on thursday morning to get the car out of the garage up the road from their house			1
by air - with @entity61 operating flights between @entity31 and @entity64 , it is conceivable that @entity10 could have stowed away on board a plane before making the final leg to @entity14 on foot			1
but at around four kilos in weight it is unlikely she would have got past the airline 's check - in staff without being asked to pay a hefty surcharge			2
by land - passenger ferries regularly run between the island and mainland @entity51			0
could the adventurous puss have smuggled herself into the back of a car or lorry and hitch - hiked her way through @entity84 before joining other migrants in @entity86 and slipping past @entity88 's border controls ? by @entity89 - attracted by the smell of fresh sardines , @entity10 may have sauntered aboard a @entity51 fishing vessel setting off on a trip to @entity88 waters before docking at the fishing village of @entity13 to stock up on oatcakes			1
@entity15 reckoned that the cat had chased her husband inside looking for human contact as there was no - one else around at that time in the morning			0
she said : ' the poor little thing had presumably ran into the garage at 6am when we took the car out in the morning			2
we let her out and put her in our back garden			0
' she ’s just a young thing - not the kind of cat you would just leave			0
she just seemed lost and kept coming back to us			0
' cat - loving @entity15 and her husband spent the day knocking on doors in the fishing village looking for the owners or anyone who knew whose cat it was - but with no luck			1
they eventually took her to the vets in the nearby town of @entity121 where they made the shock discovery that she had been chipped in the @entity51 island chain			1
at first the vets checked the local database to see if the cat had been registered in @entity14			2
when the search drew a blank they searched the @entity88 database - which also came back with no results			0
eventually the cat ’s @entity28 chip was tracked down to the @entity51 database - but with no information how she had made the 2,000 mile trip			0
shelter : the garage in the fishing village of @entity13 in @entity14 where @entity10 the cat was discovered @entity142 traveller : @entity10 is now in the care of the staff at @entity145 in @entity121 in safe hands : @entity147 with @entity149 nurse @entity148 at @entity145 in @entity121 @entity15 , who is a visually impaired artist who often paints her own two cats , said she was keen to reunite @entity10 with her owner as soon as possible			1
she said : ' she was obviously cared for - she was fit and healthy and had a pink sparkly collar on			2
' she must be a loved pet that someone is missing			0
' @entity10 is now in the care of the staff at @entity145 in @entity121 .			1
