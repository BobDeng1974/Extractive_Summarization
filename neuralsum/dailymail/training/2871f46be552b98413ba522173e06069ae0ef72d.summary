by @entity0 published : 19:57 est , 5 september 2012 updated : 04:12 est , 6 september 2012 a popular herbal remedy used by thousands of people to ward off @entity3 is a waste of time , warn researchers			1
taking ginkgo biloba supplements does not protect against developing the disease despite its reputation for improving memory and concentration			1
one of the longest and most rigorous studies ever conducted on ginkgo biloba found no proof that it helped to prevent the disease among older people starting to have memory problems			1
users have been told to take between 60 and 240mg a day to reap the benefits of this herb doctors claim this is the final nail in the coffin for the @entity25 remedy , following other trials that have found no benefit			0
around 820,000 @entity28 are affected by dementia with symptoms such as memory loss , confusion and mood changes , with @entity3 ’s the most common cause			2
many people with @entity3 ’s as well as those concerned about becoming affected take gingko , derived from the leaves of the ginkgo biloba tree			2
the latest study by @entity42 researchers looked at whether the supplements could prevent the disease taking hold			1
the trial took place over five years , involving 2854 people who were 70 years old or over , and who had asked their family doctor about memory problems			1
altogether 1406 patients were given a twice daily dose of 120mg ginkgo biloba extract , and 1414 given a placebo , designed to have a similar taste and appearance to the ginkgo pills			0
researchers used standard tests at regular intervals to assess the patients ’ memory , brain function and dementia status			1
after five years , 61 ( four per cent ) of those taking ginkgo had been diagnosed with probable alzheimer ’s disease , compared with 73 ( five per cent ) participants in the placebo group			1
the difference was not statistically significant , and the researchers also found no significant difference between the groups in the number who had died or had a stroke , says a report in the medical journal @entity79			2
the study appears to confirm similar findings of a 2009 trial in the @entity83			0
lead author professor @entity84 of the @entity85 , in @entity86 , @entity42 , said it was the largest ever @entity3 ’s prevention study carried out in @entity89			1
as one of the big retirement destinations for middle class @entity83 , @entity91 , @entity90 has also become a capital of dementia care , as @entity97 found out he said ‘ our trial was unique in that the study population was made up of more than 2,500 individuals aged 70 years and older , who were free of dementia , and who had spontaneously reported subjective memory complaints			1
‘ while our trial appears to have shown that regular use of ginkgo biloba does not protect elderly patients from progression to alzheimer ’s disease , more studies are needed on long term exposure			2
‘ the fact that prevalence of this debilitating disorder is expected to quadruple by 2050 suggests that research into preventative therapies for this disease needs to receive urgent attention ’ he added			2
professor @entity120 , director of the @entity121 ’s ( @entity121 ) @entity122 , said in a comment in the journal : ‘ if ginkgo biloba were a drug , and not marketed as a food supplement , clinical testing for efficacy against alzheimer ’s disease and cognitive impairment would have ended long ago			2
’ he said it would be ‘ unfortunate ’ if people taking gingko continued to believe it could work			1
‘ some users will rationalise that , in the absence of effective treatments , ginkgo biloba could still possibly help and , appearing safe , will not harm them			0
other users of ginkgo biloba , however , might now consider letting it go ’ he added			0
ginkgo biloba is extracted from the leaves of the @entity146 - the world ¿ s oldest living tree ginkgo biloba is extracted from the leaves of the @entity146 - the world ’s oldest living tree - which was left only in @entity25 after the @entity152			0
it contains three groups of complex compounds called flavonoids , diterpines and sesquiterpines which are thought to increase blood flow and improve circulation			0
other possible benefits , it is claimed , come from ginkgo ’s antioxidant activity , reducing the level of harmful chemicals in the body , and increasing the oxygen and nutrient supply to the central nervous system			0
a spokesman for the @entity173 charity said ‘ it is understandable that people would want to hear that an over-the - counter herbal remedy could be the answer to preventing @entity3 ’s			0
‘ for a while it was hoped that ginkgo biloba could be the wonder drug			0
‘ however , in recent years evidence - including a previous study by @entity173 - has repeatedly shown that it does not have any benefits in preventing the disease or slowing down symptoms			1
‘ one in three people over 65 will develop dementia			0
the best way for people to reduce their risk is to eat a healthy diet , exercise regularly , not smoke and keep their cholesterol levels in check .			0
