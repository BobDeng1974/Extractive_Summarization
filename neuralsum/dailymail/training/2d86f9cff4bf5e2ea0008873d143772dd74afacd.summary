by @entity0 even though @entity3 is a full month into astronomical spring , the @entity2 have been slow to give up on the harsh winter , @entity1 has revealed			0
the space agency today published this stunning picture of the @entity2 , showing a third of their expanse is still covered in ice			2
@entity10 was found to be the most affected , and was found to be 63.5 percent ice covered on april 20th			1
on april 20 , 2014 , @entity14 s @entity13 satellite captured this natural - color image of @entity10 , which straddles the @entity16 ¿ @entity18 border			1
at the time @entity13 passed over , the lake was a record 63.5 percent ice covered			1
averaged across @entity10 , ice was 22.6 centimeters ( 8.9 inches ) thick ; it was as much as twice that thickness in some locations			1
the great lakes in sunnier times : a third of their expanse is still covered in ice the stunning image was taken by the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) on @entity1 ’s @entity13 satellite			2
it captured a unique natural - color image of @entity10 , which straddles the @entity16 – @entity18 border			2
at the time @entity13 passed over , the lake was 63.5 percent ice covered , according to the @entity39 @entity38 ( @entity38 )			1
averaged across @entity10 , ice was 22.6 centimeters ( 8.9 inches ) thick ; it was as much as twice that thickness in some locations			1
researcher @entity43 said that ice cover this spring is significantly above normal			0
for comparison , @entity10 had 3.6 percent ice cover on april 20 , 2013 ; in 2012 , ice was completely gone by april 12			1
in the last winter that ice cover grew so thick on @entity10 ( 2009 ) , it reached 93.7 percent on march 2 but was down to 6.7 percent by april 21			1
average water temperatures on all of the @entity2 have been rising over the past 30 to 40 years and ice cover has generally been shrinking			0
( @entity10 ice was down about 79 percent since the 1970s			1
) but chilled by persistent polar air masses throughout the 2013 - 14 winter , ice cover reached 88.4 percent on february 13 and 92.2 percent on march 6 , 2014 , the second highest level in four decades of record - keeping			2
based on data from @entity57 , this graph shows the 2014 conditions for all of the @entity2 in mid-april compared to the past 33 years			0
@entity10 ice cover got as high as 95.3 percent on march 19			1
by april 22 , it was reported at 59.9 percent			2
air temperatures in the @entity62 were well below normal for march , and the cool pattern is being reinforced along the coasts because the water is absorbing less sunlight and warming less than in typical spring conditions			0
@entity10 ice cover got as high as 95.3 percent on march 19			1
by april 22 , it was reported at 59.9 percent ; @entity69 was nearly 30.4 percent			2
news outlets noted that as many as 70 ships have been backed up in @entity72 , @entity69 , and @entity73 , waiting for passage into ports on @entity10			0
the @entity76 has been grouping ships together into small convoys after they pass through locks at @entity80 , in order to maximize ice - breaking efficiency and to protect ships from damage			0
superior is the world ’s largest freshwater lake by area ( 82,100 square kilometers or 31,700 square miles ) and the third largest by volume			0
the waters average 147 meters ( 483 feet ) in depth , and the basin is believed to hold about 10 percent of the world ’s liquid fresh water			0
as many as 70 ships have been backed up in @entity72 , @entity69 , and @entity73 , waiting for passage into ports on @entity10			0
though @entity3 is a full month into astronomical spring , the @entity2 have been slow to give up on winter			0
as of april 22 , 2014 , the @entity2 were 33.9 percent ice covered			1
the lake they call @entity10 dominated the pack .			0

@entity100 was 63.5 percent ice covered on april 20th , according to the @entity39 @entity38
averaged across @entity10 , the ice was 8.9 inches thick and as much as twice that in some locations
