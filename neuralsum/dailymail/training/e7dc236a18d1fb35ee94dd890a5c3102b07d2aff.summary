by @entity0 published : 14:08 est , 10 january 2014 updated : 18:38 est , 10 january 2014 jailed : @entity2 , a fraudster who duped a @entity4 businesswoman out of more than £ 650,000 , has been jailed today a former security guard who posed as an investment tycoon to con a @entity8 businesswoman out of £ 625,000 has been jailed for three - and - a - half years			1
@entity2 , 45 , from @entity9 , tricked company chief executive @entity10 by pretending to be a go - between for a potential $ 1.5 billion dollar investment into her hedge fund			1
mrs @entity10 , 46 , held a series of business meetings with @entity2 at top @entity18 hotels the @entity19 and @entity20 not realising the bachelor had been living with his mother in a £ 56,000 inner city terraced house in @entity25 , @entity9			1
during the two - month scam @entity2 went on ' a charm offensive ' with his knowledge of finance , talk of introducing investors from the @entity32 and of having a @entity34 bank account			1
after one meeting he drove former semi-professional tennis player mrs @entity10 back to her apartment in a @entity37 and later professed his love for her			2
when he asked for $ 1milion as a returnable security deposit to clinch the deal , mrs @entity10 and her husband @entity41 , 44 , agreed to transfer the money in sterling to @entity2 ’s bank account without carrying out any checks on his background			1
but the alarm was raised after @entity48 - a fellow director at @entity49 - found out about the deposit and looked into @entity2 's background			1
he discovered @entity2 in fact ran a cleaning company with net assets of just £ 657			1
mrs @entity10 realised she had been duped when she returned from a business trip with @entity2 in @entity56 with a plan to leave her husband - only to be faced by mr @entity48 insisting her lover was a fraud			1
when mrs @entity10 asked for the money back , @entity2 - who had flown home early - sent a text message saying : ' talke my dear			1
they should have it by five this evening			0
' four weeks later when police caught up with @entity2 he was at the wheel of a black @entity75 carrying a wad of £ 1,000 in cash			1
he had recently bought a house for £ 175,000 and had a black @entity79 parked in the driveway			2
the @entity37 turned out to be rented and before the scam he drove a 2003 @entity82			0
con : @entity10 ( left ) was duped by the former security guard after the pair met at two top @entity18 hotels for business meetings			1
@entity2 even told the @entity8 executive he had fallen in love with her @entity2 , who the sole carer to his 72 - year - old mother who is undergoing chemotherapy for cancer , was convicted of two counts of fraud by false representation and one count of money laundering last month			1
he was jailed at @entity98 for three - and - a - half years today			1
sentencing , judge @entity99 told him : ' it is obvious that he managed to charm her before he wormed his way into her affections			2
' she fell under his spell , she became infatuated with him and in the process she seems to have lost her critical faculties and made no checks			0
' she did n’t ask for character or credit references , she said simply she trusted him			0
in my mind she was naive to the point of being vulnerable as the defendant recognised			0
' he took advantage of her , spinning extravagant and absurd lies			0
it were a complete fiction yet she apparently swallowed it all			0
reality : @entity2 's cleaning business was registered to this address in @entity25 , @entity9 ' he has not shown the slightest regret or remorse			1
it seems to me cunning			0
he did not squander the proceeds and substantial amount remains in the bank account where it was restrained			0
' today he has produced documents giving consent to pay @entity49 £ 553,167.61			2
' this was a brazen fraud committed with considerable scheming			2
he played the high stake game and the price must be paid			2
' before the scam , @entity2 worked as a security guard , lived with his mother and had bought his new house with a £ 30,000 deposit he borrowed from two friends			1
during the trial @entity2 claimed the $ 1.5b deal would have gone through but it failed as @entity49 did not have a relevant trading licence			1
the jury was told the @entity146 and mrs @entity10 and mr @entity48 had formed @entity49 in april 2012 set up an office in @entity148 , in @entity18 and were aiming to form a hedge fund using their expertise on banking and foreign exchange			1
they were introduced to @entity2 though a @entity8 friend who met him at a renewable energy fair and believed he was genuine			1
@entity2 said he was interested in investing and a meeting was held at the @entity19 on august 3 2012			2
suspicious : when police caught up with @entity2 , he had bought this £ 175,000 home in @entity9 at a meeting at the same hotel a week later , @entity2 introduced mrs @entity10 to a man he said was the ' doctor from @entity165 ' as another potential investor			1
he then drove mrs @entity10 home in his @entity37 before saying he was dropping off his friend at the ferry port			2
at a third meeting at @entity19 on august 17 , @entity2 said he wanted to introduce investors from @entity172 and @entity173 who had $ 1.5billion to invest in the hedge fund and later at a wedding the @entity10 ’ were asked to pay a $ 1m security despot to @entity2 to ' demonstrate the legitimacy and viability ' of @entity49			1
during a subsequent meeting in a @entity182 restaurant in @entity183 on september 7 @entity2 promised to pay back the money immediately once he had shown it to his investors			1
the money was transferred to the account of @entity2 ’s cleaning company @entity187 @entity188 on september 14			2
family : mrs @entity10 ' husband @entity41 - who also agreed to transfer $ 1million to @entity2 @entity2 then sent mrs @entity10 an email saying : ' @entity192			1
hope all is well with you			0
@entity194 went really well but unfortunately i ’m still here trying to sort other bits out			0
my investors have transferred 1.5billion into my account			0
' they do n’t know what security deposit i am taking off you so you need to sort this out quick so i can give them the feedback			1
' she replied : ' @entity205 that sounds all good and great			0
been with @entity206 and they guarantee the money to be in the account by 5pm today			0
for your security i attach the proof of transfer with this email			0
' later the pair flew to @entity56 to investigate potential investments but @entity2 returned to the @entity188 early claiming his mother was ill. it emerged @entity2 had withdrawn £ 130,000 from the account just seven days after the money went in			1
as the alleged fraud unfolded @entity2 sent other texts to mrs @entity10 saying : ' good morning my dear hope you ’re well			1
the funds should be in your account by now as they ’re out of mine			0
' another said : ' tell him not to worry			0
he will have the funds			0
' mrs @entity10 told the hearing : ' he said he fell in love with me			2
i was then charmed and fell in love with him			0
the nature of the relationship was too deep for comfort			0
i was under additional pressure when he confessed his love			0
i reciprocated and regret that very much			0
' for him he indicated i was a prized possession and would bring success for the company			0
i gave in to the pressure			0
' mr @entity253 said : ' this was the first time her business decision and my business decision were not correct because we were involved with someone who played a very clever game			0
' speaking after the court hearing pc @entity263 said : ' there is no doubt that @entity2 can talk the talk and walk the walk			2
' he lived in a modest home and had a registered company with minimal assets , but played the role of a man with international business connections worth billions of pounds with apparent ease			2
' so convincing was his portrayal , that he was able to dupe a number of highly successful and experienced business people out of huge sums			0
' his assets have been frozen and now that he has been convicted we will use the full force of the law to recoup as much of the stolen money as possible			2
