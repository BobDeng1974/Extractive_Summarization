by @entity0 blondes have long been the butt of jokes for their supposed lack of intelligence			2
but those with a fair head of hair can now take heart - for scientists have disproved the dumb blonde stereotype			2
new research has revealed that hair colour is ‘ only skin deep ’ because it depends on just a single letter of the genetic code			1
not so dumb : the study proves hair colour is completely unrelated to any other trait and dispels the shallow claim that blonde hair signifies lower intelligence switching a single ‘ letter ’ of @entity24 would turn brunettes to blondes , according to academics from @entity28 in @entity29 - and would have no affect on the brain			1
the study proves hair colour is completely unrelated to any other trait and dispels the shallow claim that blonde hair signifies lower intelligence			1
lead researcher professor @entity33 said : ‘ the genetic mechanism that controls blond hair does n’t alter the biology of any other part of the body			0
switching a single ' letter ' of @entity24 ( pictured ) would turn brunettes to blondes but not affect the brain ‘ it ’s a good example of a trait that ’s skin deep - and only skin deep			1
’ researchers also found that the gene that affects blonde hair is n’t associated with eye colour - suggesting that blonde hair and blue eyes are not genetically linked			1
experiments with mice showed that the ‘ blonde ’ switch caused animals to be born with light , golden - brown fur			0
the switch alters activity of a gene called kit ligand that was already known to be associated with hair colour			1
compared with its ‘ brunette ’ version , which has a different dna letter , it reduced kit ligand activity by about 20 per cent			2
dr @entity33 , whose research appears in the journal @entity69 , said : ‘ this is a good example of how fine - tuned regulatory differences may be to produce different traits			0
’ many other regulatory elements may be scattered throughout the dna that surrounds the kit ligand gene , he added			0
the gene not only aids the development of pigment - producing cells , but has a host of other roles around the body			0
it influences the behaviour of blood stem cells , sperm or egg precursors , and gut neurons .			0

new study proves hair colour has no impact on intelligence or *personality*
switching a single @entity24 ' letter ' can change a blonde person to a brunette
