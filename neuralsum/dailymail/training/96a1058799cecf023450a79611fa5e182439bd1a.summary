by @entity0 published : 07:47 est , 8 march 2013 updated : 08:55 est , 8 march 2013 cashing in : insurance tycoon @entity1 is set to pocket £ 175m from the £ 1bn flotation of his online venture @entity3 the insurance tycoon who founded @entity6 and @entity7 is set to pocket £ 175m from the flotation of his massively successful online venture @entity3 , it emerged today			1
@entity1 , who is chairman of the company and owns 90 per cent alongside private equity backer @entity11 , will dispose of only part of his shareholding in the @entity17 market 's biggest float so far this year			1
stock in the initial public offering will be priced at between 240p and 310p , giving it a mid-point valuation of £ 1.15billion and enough for a place in the @entity23			1
mr @entity1 , who will remain @entity3 's largest shareholder , said today : ' we have worked hard for many years to make @entity3 a business that can compete at the highest level with confidence			1
' mr @entity1 established @entity3 in 1999 , after massive success with @entity6 , and also later founded women - focused car insurer @entity7 as well as taking a 50 per cent stake in comparison website @entity33			1
the 65 - year - old entrepreneur 's wealth was estimated at £ 500m by 2011 's @entity37			1
in december , he vowed to keep all his wealth in @entity39 and to pay his full tax here when @entity3 floated			1
his comments came after it was reported some months earlier that he was looking at the possibility of moving his domicile to the @entity46 as a means of easing his tax burden			0
but with the increasing disclosures of widespread tax avoidance by businesses operating in @entity39 , @entity1 made it clear he and his family want to lead by example by making their full contribution to the exchequer			2
@entity1 is one of the few @entity39 financiers to emerge from the great financial panic with his business empire enhanced			2
when his partners @entity61 - @entity62 ran into difficulty in the autumn of 2008 , he moved quickly to rescue @entity3 from the wreckage using his personal wealth to buy back his shares in the group			2
‘ i am a @entity39 resident and intend to stay in the @entity39 , ’ @entity1 said in december			2
business powerhouse : mr @entity1 ( pictured with @entity71 chief executive @entity70 in 2000 ) established @entity3 in 1999 after enjoying huge success with @entity6 eye - catching : @entity3 was made famous by the late @entity73 's ' calm down , dear ' television adverts as a father of five daughters , @entity1 did not need convincing that women are the safer drivers			1
@entity3 broke new ground in the @entity39 insurance market in 2005 by reaching out to women through the @entity82 ’ wheels brand , characterised by its three pink sequin - clad @entity82 ( above ) from @entity84			2
the company has enjoyed phenomenal success in large due to the lower degree of risk			0
and as 95 per cent of policyholders are female , this has also minimised the price disruption caused by the recent introduction of a new gender - neutral pricing regime across the industry			0
he was also sharply critical of @entity97 firms such as @entity98 and @entity99 that make huge profits in @entity39 and compete with his online insurance site @entity33 but avoid @entity39 tax			0
he urged the government to create a ‘ level playing field for online businesses ’ in the @entity39			0
@entity1 is among the most successful figures in the global insurance industry			2
in an earlier life at @entity110 , he built @entity6 in 1985 , which at its peak earnings power was estimated to be worth £ 10billion			0
he had done much the same in the @entity97 , where he has been a key figure at insurer @entity114			0
as someone who spends a considerable part of his business life in the @entity97 – in @entity115 and also has a home in @entity120 – @entity1 had no shortage of routes to avoid the net of @entity39 taxation			0
following the ipo , @entity1 intends to remain chairman as well as being the largest shareholder			1
he is committing , however , that any chairman ’s fees go directly into a charitable trust and he will be paying the full whack of income tax on any dividends that he receives in the future			0
confidence in @entity136 has been lifted by the successful listing of housebuilder @entity138 , which was priced at 220p or £ 550million on february 13 and is now trading at 280p			0
the @entity3 business , which was made famous by the late @entity73 's ' calm down , dear ' television ads , was created out of a joint venture with the @entity71 before @entity142 sold its 70 per cent stake in 2010			1
wealthy : mr @entity1 ( seen here with @entity146 , managing director of @entity147 ) has a estimated fortune of £ 500m according to 2011 's @entity37 there were 1.25million in - force motor policies and 500,000 home policies at the end of 2012 , helping the @entity154 - based company to more than double pre-tax profits to £ 115.5million last year			1
the company 's conservative approach to underwriting means 87 per cent of its motor policy holders are over 30 years of age , while 98 per cent of in - force home policies are located in areas considered to have low risk of flooding			1
and as 95 per cent of @entity7 policyholders are female , this has minimised the price disruption caused by the recent introduction of a new gender - neutral pricing regime across the industry			0
the ipo , which will place between 35 per cent and 50 per cent of shares in public hands , will raise £ 50million towards paying down debt .			0

@entity3 chairman @entity1 will remain company 's largest shareholder
@entity179 will float between 240p and 310pm , putting it in the @entity23
