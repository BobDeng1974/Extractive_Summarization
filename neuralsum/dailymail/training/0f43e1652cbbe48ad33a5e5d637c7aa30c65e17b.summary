astonishingly 12 per cent of young people thought that the battle of @entity11 , fought in 1815 as part of the @entity13 , was part of the @entity3			1
lack of knowledge : too many of us do not know our history - one person even thought the @entity3 began in 1800 the teenagers also seem less interested in history than previous generations , with only 48 per cent visiting their local war memorial , whereas 59 per cent of respondents across all ages had done so			1
although the survey arranged by @entity25 showed up how ignorant the nation 's youth is of history , they are not alone			2
when asked by @entity31 , members of the public hazarded guesses as wildly out as 1800 and 1950 for the start of the @entity3 , and 1910 and 1960 for the end date			1

' the centenary ( of the war ) is a huge opportunity for schools and museums to do more to help our kids and all ages learn more about our nation 's history			0
