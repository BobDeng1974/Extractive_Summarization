by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 has confirmed his race seat with @entity4 is guaranteed until the end of the season			1
a fortnight ago @entity2 's @entity8 career appeared in limbo after he was axed from the @entity11 @entity10 due to ' contractual issues ' , with @entity14 @entity13 stepping in			1

we 're now looking forward as we 're still in an amazing position as a team			2
' the best thing we can do now is focus on staying ahead of @entity44			2
' as for next season , that remains up in the air , with @entity2 adding ahead of this weekend 's @entity48 @entity10 : ' all i can do is the best job i can			1
' i had a good start to the year , but then a couple of races which have n't been particularly great			0

' committed : @entity2 remains keen on securing a new deal at @entity4 behind the scenes , that is up to @entity2 's management to try to strike a new deal with the team			1
