@entity1 researchers have revealed artificial intelligence software so smart it can beat most real students on a high school test			1
known as @entity7 , the @entity9 software scored higher on the @entity11 section of @entity1 's standardized college entrance test than the average @entity1 high school senior , its developers said			1
it has also managed to double its score in just 12 months - raising hopes it will eventually pass the entrance exam for @entity20 , @entity1 's most prestigious college			1
man vs machine : @entity20 helped this robot , @entity24 , which was sent to space			2
now researchers hope to create artificial intelligence software so smart it can pass the university entrance exam itself			1
to - @entity7 was able to correctly choose the answer that best fits the following conversation : a : i hear your father is in the hospital			2
b : yes , and he has to have an operation next week			0
a : let me know if i can do anything			0
b : thanks a lot			0
possible answers : – exactly , yes – no problem – that 's a relief – that 's too bad ' the average score for the @entity11 section of the standardized entrance exam was 93.1 ( out of 200 ) , but the @entity9 scored 95 , ' a spokesman for @entity44 and @entity45 said			1
last year the software scored 52			1
the @entity44 lab is developing the software alongside the @entity52 , and is in charge of developing the software 's @entity11 capabilities			1
the project began in 2011 with a 10 - year time frame for reaching its goal			0
questions from the test were turned into data that could be recognized by the software			2
to - @entity7 then processed the information , distinguishing the logic of exchanges and correctly identifying the right answer out of multiple choices			0
' one of our purposes is to reveal the limitations of @entity9 , ' said @entity72 , an @entity52 professor who heads the project , told the @entity74			0
' showing how humans and machines will be able to supplement each other is a key for @entity1 's economic growth in the future			1
' the latest test score results showed that @entity82 has a probability of at least 80 percent of passing the exams of 80 percent of 581 private universities across @entity1			1
one reason is the great improvement in its scores for @entity11 and @entity1 , @entity87 officials said			1
the latest test score results showed that @entity82 has a probability of at least 80 percent of passing the exams of 80 percent of 581 private universities across @entity1			2
however , they admit the software has has more work to do			0
the @entity9 program can not grasp unrealistic situations , such as an object with no mass or an environment with no friction , in the physics test			0
it also struggled with concepts it had never heard of - for instance , it did not know what democracy is like because it has yet to learn the idea of majority rule , social justice concepts and other related information			0
in the @entity11 test , it was unable to answer questions using figures and illustrations			2
it was better at recognizing photographs , the researchers said .			0

to - robo software scored higher on the @entity11 section of @entity1 's standardized college entrance test than the average @entity1 high school senior
developers hope it will eventually pass the entrance exam for @entity20
