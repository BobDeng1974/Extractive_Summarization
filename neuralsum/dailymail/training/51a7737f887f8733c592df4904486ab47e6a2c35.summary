by @entity0 @entity1 , 28 , was scheduled to spend three weeks in @entity2 on the hiking holiday which had been branded as ¿ high risk ¿ a super fit @entity7 worker who died on an adventure trip through a notorious ‘ @entity9 ’ in the @entity10 was so sick she was unable to tie her own shoelaces , an inquest heard today			1
@entity1 , 28 , was scheduled to spend three weeks in @entity2 on the hiking holiday which had been branded as ‘ high risk ’ by the @entity14 based @entity15			1
she flew into @entity17 with two friends on 15 april , 2011 and began to travel on foot to base camp @entity20 , @entity16 was told			1
miss @entity1 began to show signs of possible altitude sickness and was struggling to keep up with the group as they trekked through the @entity24 , which has been nicknamed the ‘ @entity9 ’			1
her hand - eye co-ordination had failed and she was left unable to tie her shoelaces			2
she was breathless and coughing and her lips were tinged with purple			0
on the sixth day of the hike she was taken on foot partway back down the mountain and died the following day , april 23 , in @entity33 , @entity17			1
@entity34 , a friend who joined miss @entity1 on the hike , said that after days of trekking in the sun , the trip became dramatically tougher			1
‘ we were exhausted arriving at @entity33 , ’ she said			0
the following day , on april 21 , miss @entity1 began to lag behind the group , struggling to reach the next check point at @entity41 90 minutes behind with ‘ a tinge of purple ’ to her lips			1
‘ we did notice that her lips looked a little purple and i asked her how she was going			0
tragic : photograph shows @entity1 pictured on her trekking holiday before she died in 2011 ‘ with @entity1 ’s good spirits she replied " i ’m fine "			1
‘ we were all a little breathless			0
’ at this point the group had reached an altitude of 4,470 metres and the nights had grown ‘ very cold ’			0
‘ she said she was n’t feeling very well and that is when we decided that we needed to tell @entity57 ( the guide ) and we thought that she should n’t continue , ’ ms @entity34 said			0
‘ none of us had slept very well last night so she was tired and lethargic with a tinge of purple , she still had the cough and generally felt unwell			0
‘ i had a cough , i felt tired but @entity1 was worse than us			2
‘ she had lost her spirit which was unusual for @entity1 , ’ she said			2
@entity1 was scheduled to spend three weeks in @entity2 on the hiking holiday ‘ every other morning she had been able to tie up her shoelaces and pack , we did n’t notice initially			1
‘ it was n’t until we went back to have something to eat that we noticed that her shoelaces were undone			2
’ miss @entity1 agreed to descend the mountain and was last seen ‘ walking into the distance ’			1
that evening ms @entity34 and friend @entity74 used a satellite phone to tell ‘ a man in @entity17 ’ their friend ’s insurance details and she was later pronounced dead			2
‘ there was no way that you could n’t notice her symptoms , ’ said ms @entity74 who confirmed that she had seen miss @entity1 being given @entity79 for her symptoms			2
practices at @entity15 were put under the magnifying glass at the hearing as it transpired that she may have been left with an assistant not trained in altitude sickness after falling ill. @entity90 was working as a health and safety executive at the company when they revised the risk assessment for the trip			1
‘ i know that the tour leaders had all the five - day wildnerness training and all the assistant guides had @entity99 ( acute mountain sickness ) training as well , ’ she said			1
‘ you do n’t look at the assistants ? ’ said coroner doctor @entity102			0
‘ i do n’t , no , ’ she replied			0
‘ is there a reason for drawing a line between the assistants and the guides ? ’ ‘ if someone was suffering from @entity99 , i would assume that the guide would go with them or they would be evacuated off the mountain			0
’ but dr @entity102 said there was ‘ some evidence that an assistant took @entity118 ’ after she became unwell			0
and ms @entity90 told the inquest that the tour brochure underestimated the height of the mountain at 3,780m prior to completing her assessment			0
@entity124 showing the ' @entity9 ' in the @entity10 where @entity1 fell ill the trip , which included a 640 - metre ascent in one day when the recommended distance is 300 metres ‘ escaped my notice ’ , she said			1
‘ there was no incidents that i had looked at , the trip was very well established when i picked it up so there was no changes to that ( risk assessment ) , ’ she explained			0
@entity135 , national director , said that the company was not aware that there was a rescue post in the area @entity140 died and said she was not taken for medical attention before she died			0
miss @entity1 , of @entity142 , @entity143 , had just completed a half marathon and played squash at least once a week			2
