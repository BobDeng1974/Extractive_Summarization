four months , fourteen miles and a change of surface separate @entity1 from this week ’s proceedings at the @entity4 but not much seemed to have altered on sunday for @entity5			1
having played a strangely lacklustre match on his last appearance in @entity9 – the quarter final defeat to @entity11 at @entity12 – he lobbed in a similarly curious performance to open the @entity14			0
except this one was even worse			0
whereas the @entity17 had excelled beyond himself on that summer afternoon @entity16 did not even have to produce his best to win 6 - 4 6 - 4 and jeopardise @entity5 ’s hopes for this week at the @entity4			1
like @entity16 , he was making his debut at this tournament and was nervous at the start			1
unlike the @entity41 player he was up against an opponent in @entity30 who was ruthlessly sharp enough to take advantage from the off , rather than @entity5 , who was reluctant to take the initiative			1
@entity30 returns a forehand in his opening @entity14 match against @entity27 in @entity9 @entity30 celebrates winning a point during the opening set while @entity27 puts the work in to make a return both opening matches drew an excess of 17,000 spectators , and those who packed the venue to its dimly - lit rafters for the first session were to be reminded of an eternal truth about the 27 year - old @entity61 : for all his career achievements you are still never quite sure what you are going to get with him			2
not much , it turned out , on this occasion			0
he was desperately vulnerable on his serve and stuck so far back behind the baseline in the rallies there was a danger of him incurring a fee for parking			0
surprisingly sanguine afterwards , he dismissed the notion that the left calf muscle he had treated might have been a factor			0
' i felt okay on the court today , i do n’t think that was the reason i lost the match , ' said @entity5			2
' if this was anywhere else i would be out of the tournament			0
i ’m definitely going to have to play better if i am going to get through			0
' @entity16 had never beat @entity5 before today and the @entity41 managed to silence his fans in @entity9 the @entity41 player was not hugely better than @entity5 , but he stifled the @entity88 's resurgence to beat him all his supporters can hope for now is that , with back to the wall , he shows the same resolve that drove him to play six consecutive weeks in @entity92 and @entity93 to qualify for this eight - man field in the first place			1
you suspect he instinctively prefers to be in that situation anyway as he has never been a great front runner , which is what he might have considered himself to be against 02 new boy @entity16			2
@entity5 ’s demeanour was certainly flat , despite the fact that he was given a rousing enough welcome , and his second serve took particular punishment			2
he denied afterwards suggestions on sunday from @entity106 that he has made deliberate if subtle changes to his action since back surgery : ' i would n’t have intentionally changed serve because i was n’t getting any problems with my back from my service action , ' he said			0
' at the end of the year i will look at video from before and now to see if things have evolved			0
' @entity16 capitalised upon numerous mistakes on @entity5 's second serve , as @entity5 failed to settle @entity5 fought back form 3 - 0 to 4 - 4 in the second set , but was unable to continue to build his momentum he is bound to be aware of minor changes in his ball toss already , and it is something he will have to review with head coach @entity125 , who also has to fathom out a complex temperament that leaves him so prone to letdowns			1
in his previous match , against @entity129 in @entity130 ten days ago , he competed well before mentally tuning out and collapsing in the last five games			0
there was no sign of the resourcefulness or fight that carried him to three @entity14 titles in six weeks , and also absent was any of the all - court attacking intent she would like to instil in him			2
@entity16 was there for the taking early on and could not a land a first serve in			1
he pretty much gifted @entity5 a break to fall 3 - 2 behind but then had the donation reciprocated straightaway before the first set was dismally conceded			1
@entity5 's next games are against @entity30 and @entity27 and he will have to play much better a brief glimpse of attacking purpose was given when @entity5 got back from 1 - 4 to 4 - 4 in the second , but he was broken again to lose the match with a backhand that went almost embarrassingly long beyond the baseline			1
further down the scale , @entity155 number two @entity153 narrowly missed out on entering the world ’s top 100 for the first time when he lost 6 - 4 6 - 1 to @entity161 @entity160 in final of the @entity162 in @entity163			1
the 27 year - old @entity9 , who has now ended his season , is likely to go up to around 102 in the new rankings and already should be assured of a direct entry into january ’s @entity167			0
@entity168 disappointed after @entity16 defeat			2

@entity16 *deservedly* won the first set against @entity5 6 - 4
the @entity41 raced into a 3 - 0 lead in the second , before @entity5 got to 4 - 4
but @entity16 stifled any comeback from @entity5 , taking the second 6 - 4
