by @entity1 reporter published : 15:32 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 18:34 est , 8 january 2014 as anyone embarking on a @entity7 's diet will understand , sometimes the allure of chocolate can be almost impossible to resist			1
that is what the owner of @entity11 's chocolate shop in @entity12 must have been thinking as he lovingly arranged the window display on monday			1
but the treats proved so tempting they attracted a rather unwanted visitor in the form of a rat , who was caught having his very own midnight feast after closing hours			2
midnight feast : the rat was caught helping itself to chocolates after the shop had closed for the night fine taste : the cheeky critter was helping itself to luxury @entity28 @entity27 truffles trouble : staff say they have never had problems before , despite the area being known as a home for rodents the rodent was found chewing its way through several expensive @entity28 @entity27 truffles by shocked members of staff			1
chocolate shop worker @entity39 , said : ' i could see one at a time			1
we do n't know if it was one and the same or more			0
she added : ' it was n't afraid			0
but you did n't know what was rat droppings or sprinkles			0
' is that what i think it is ? : assistant said it was difficult to differentiate between sprinkles and rat droppings reassuring : the owner of the shop insisted the chocolates were for display only and would n't be sold ratatouille : the scenes are reminiscent of the animated film in which a rat wants to become a chef and so invades the kitchens of @entity67 in order to cook luckily for customers owner @entity69 said the chocolate in the winder were not for sale , and that everything else was put away at night			2
he added : ' i 've worked here for six years			0
it is the first time i hear about rats			0
i will speak to the landlord tomorrow , it 's his responsibility			0
' @entity11 's is located in @entity80 in @entity12 , an area which is known for its problems with rats and other pests , so it is perhaps surprising that even the display chocolates were left out overnight			1
raided : it was @entity11 's chocolate shop in @entity12 that was targetted by the hungry late - night thief blending in : it may have been hard for staff to spot the rat as it camouflaged itself with the brown chocolates the scenes are reminiscent of @entity94 , the animated film in which a rat called @entity97 with aspirations of becoming a chef infiltrates some of @entity67 's best kitchens in order to cook			1
after impressing the city 's toughest restaurant critic @entity97 is eventually revealed as a rat and is chased out of town			0
however it looks as if the rat in @entity12 has managed to cook up nothing other than trouble , and is likely to have had a similar fate awaiting him .			2
