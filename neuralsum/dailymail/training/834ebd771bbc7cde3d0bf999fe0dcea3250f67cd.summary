by @entity0 published : 08:10 est , 2 july 2012 updated : 18:13 est , 2 july 2012 worrying : a review of @entity3 's state finances - requested by president @entity4 - has revealed a massive £ 27billion shortfall in its economy , threatening the country 's deficit goals new @entity3 president @entity4 – elected on an anti-austerity platform – was yesterday told ' unprecedented ' cuts were needed to plug a gaping hole in the country 's budget			1
@entity3 's accounting watchdog warned the government needs to find £ 35billion in savings over the next two years to drag it out of the ' danger zone '			2
@entity20 , head of the country 's @entity22 audit body , said repairing the battered public finances was ' crucial ' and must not be delayed			2
' it will require an unprecedented brake on spending and higher taxes , ' he said			0
the tough message was a blow to socialist mr @entity4 , who declared that ' austerity can no longer be inevitable ' after he defeated @entity32 in may and has repeatedly called for @entity33 to focus on growth			1
@entity3 , which has lost its @entity36 credit rating , ran up a deficit of £ 83billion last year – or more than five per cent of gdp – and its £ 1.4trillion debt amounts to £ 50,000 per household , or 86 per cent of gdp			1
the auditor said savings of up to £ 8billion were needed this year and a further £ 27billion next year to get the deficit under control and meet mr @entity4 's budget target of cutting it to three per cent of gdp next year and eliminating it in 2017			1
mr @entity20 warned action must be taken now to prevent a backlash on the financial markets and a possible bailout			0
@entity3 prime minister @entity51 will outline the socialist 's economic plan today and finance minister @entity54 will publish details of a revised budget tomorrow			2
' there will be tax increases , there will be spending cuts , ' mr @entity54 admitted last week			2
' but we must avoid a budget that hurts economic activity			0
' mr @entity4 's task will be made even more difficult by weak economic growth			1
the auditor forecast expansion of 0.4 per cent this year and one per cent in 2013			2
@entity4 's approval rating has already slid by seven points to around 51 per cent as the public fears more economic gloom			1
the government will revise down official growth forecasts as it uses the audit to rework the 2012 budget , finance minister @entity54 said in a newspaper interview			0
the @entity76 -- a quasi-judicial body responsible for overseeing public accounts - said it had not uncovered any new skeletons left by the outgoing government of conservative former president @entity32			1
it pointed to 1.2 to 2.0 billion euros of likely overspending this year in areas like defence , agriculture and housing , but said this was normal			0
bad news : the government plans tax rises on the wealthy and on companies to adjust the 2012 budget , but unpopular welfare and civil service job cuts are likely next year			1
the @entity92 is pictured in @entity93 @entity94 : the president of the @entity96 , @entity20 , poses with the court 's report on the country 's finances the main obstacle to @entity4 's pledge to honour @entity3 's @entity105 deficit targets of 4.5 per cent of gdp this year and 3.0 per cent in 2013 , the court said , was a revenue shortfall due to over optimistic assumptions on economic growth			1
the crunch year for public finances would come in 2013 , the auditors said , when the government must make the biggest step in deficit reduction in the face of weak growth , a persistent euro zone crisis and rising domestic anger over high unemployment			1
' respecting the 2013 public finance target is particularly important for @entity3 's credibility with the euro zone gravely affected by a debt crisis , ' the report said			2
even if @entity93 meets this year 's target , public debt is on course to top the 90 per cent of gdp level at which economists see a negative impact on growth , making it vital that the government act quickly			1
' if the dynamic of public debt does not slow , the risk premium demanded by investors will raise debt servicing costs and limit still further the room for manoeuvre , ' it said			2
government sources have already said that a revised 2012 budget , due before the cabinet on wednesday , will include some 7.5 billion euros in new taxes , including increases in wealth tax and a financial transactions tax			0
but the auditor 's report will strengthen the case for tough spending and tax measures in the 2013 budget , due in the autumn , potentially helping the government face down opposition from powerful trade unions and its own far - left political allies			1
the @entity76 said growth this year would be around 0.4 per cent , less than the 0.7 per cent assumption in the old budget			0
for 2013 , the auditors assumed growth of 1 per cent , well shy of the previous government 's 1.75 per cent forecast			1
the new government appeared to agree			0
@entity54 told @entity168 he would base a 2012 corrective budget on a growth forecast of 0.4 per cent or less , and the 2013 plan on output expansion of 1.0 to 1.3 per cent			0
while neighbouring @entity174 was starting to reduce its debt , @entity3 's was still climbing , draining the competitiveness of its economy , the court said			0
@entity3 urgently needed to rein in one of the highest state spending levels in @entity33 , at 56 per cent of gdp			0
' budgetary adjustments should be aimed mainly at spending , ' the report said , noting that efficiency gains would allow this to be done without affecting the quality of services			0
it said job cuts were indispensable to curb mounting payroll costs			1
the @entity76 is headed by @entity20 , a former @entity191 politician appointed by @entity32 , giving its recommendations bipartisan authority			0
in the short term , the auditors accepted that tax rises were needed to avoid drastic spending cuts which would choke off a recovery			1
they recommended reductions to tax exemptions and a short - term increase in @entity203 and the @entity205 welfare charge			2
the court report did not take into account measures approved by the government since it took office in may , including a two percent rise in the minimum wage			0
change : the state auditors said it had not uncovered any new skeletons left by the outgoing government of conservative former president @entity32			0
he is pictured with his wife @entity217 leaving the @entity218 after @entity4 was sworn in as president its figures also did not include a recent @entity105 decision on taxation of foreign investment funds , which could cost @entity3 up to 9 billion euros , nor the extra cost of @entity3 's share in a 100 billion euro zone bailout for @entity229 banks , agreed last month			1
if the 33 billion euros next year were split evenly between spending reductions and new taxes , the government could find the 16.5 billion euros of expenditure savings by slowing state spending increases to the pace of inflation , the auditors said			0
prime minister @entity51 , due to set out his legislative agenda to parliament on tuesday , has said the central government - which accounts for four - fifths of the deficit - would hold spending flat between 2013 and 2015 .			0

president @entity4 now has task of *explaining* to *voters* that sweeping costs cuts will be inevitable - despite promising an end to austerity
government plans tax rises on the wealthy and on companies but unpopular welfare and civil service job cuts are likely next year
@entity4 's approval rating has slid by seven points to 51 per cent as the public fears more economic gloom
