from silvery sardine skins to colourful peacock feathers , nature is full of surfaces that dazzle brighter than anything humans can create			1
now @entity6 researchers have revealed that there is a ' universal explanation ' behind the amazing colours in the natural world			0
they claim that the same microscopic layers of crystals are responsible for the reflective scales of fish as they are for iridescent colours on butterfly wings			1
scientists at @entity18 claim that the same microscopic layers of crystals are responsible for the reflective scales of fish as they are for iridescent colours on butterfly wings according to a report by @entity25 in the @entity26 , the world 's creatures have evolved tiny structures that make use of light better than man - made structure			1
researchers at @entity32 claim that the process in nature could be copied by humans to create , for instance , leds that are more efficient			1
' what 's important is that the crystals have a range of different thicknesses , ' dr @entity38 , a member of the research team , told the @entity26			0
varying levels of these nanoscale crystals can be found in creatures such as beetles , butterflies and sardines , all of which produce an effect known as @entity54 localisation			1
varying levels of these nanoscale crystals can be found in creatures such as beetles , butterflies and sardines , all of which produce an effect known as @entity54 localisation			1
pictured is a leaf beetle this refers to a physical phenomenon in which light waves are prevented from passing straight through a material in 1958 , @entity54 published an article in which he discussed the behaviour of electrons in a dirty crystal			1
he claimed light can not spread in a straight line in a cloudy medium because the many layers of crystal divert the light as defects			1
if the disorder - the concentration of defects - exceeds a certain level , the waves are no longer able to spread in a cloudy medium at all			0
varying levels of these nanoscale crystals can be found in creatures such as beetles , butterflies and sardines , all of which produce an effect known as @entity54 localisation			1
as the light goes in and meets these changes in the different layers , the multiple waves all interfere with each other			2
the light moves around inside the layers and is reflected back out , producing a colourful metallic effect			2
' as the light [ wave ] goes in and meets these changes in the different layers , the multiple waves all interfere with each other , ' lead scientist on the study , dr @entity97 told the @entity26			2
the light moves around inside the layers and is reflected back out , producing a colourful metallic effect			2
in an earlier study on this same topic , dr @entity97 said fish may have evolved this multilayer structure to help conceal them from predators			0
' these fish have found a way to maximise their reflectivity over all angles they are viewed from , ' he said			0
' this helps the fish best match the light environment of the open ocean , making them less likely to be seen			2
' as a result of this ability , the skin of silvery fish or the colours in a peacock feather could hold the key to better optical devices			0
many modern day optical devices such as led lights and low loss optical fibres use these non-polarising types of reflectors to improve efficiency , explained dr @entity38			0
' however , these man - made reflectors currently require the use of materials with specific optical properties that are not always ideal , ' he added			0
the mechanism that has evolved in fish overcomes this current design limitation and provides a new way to manufacture energy efficient lights			0
@entity148 ( right ) skins and colourful peacock features ( left ) could help engineers develop better leds			0

tiny crystal layers create iridescent surfaces in fish , butterflies and beetles
these nanoscale layers produce an effect known as @entity54 localisation
this is when light waves are prevented from passing straight in a material
the process in nature can be copied to create leds that are more efficient
