winning an @entity0 is the pinnacle of success for those in the film industry and so it 's perhaps no surprise that many have been overcome with emotion in their moment of triumph			1
while most over the decades have been able to accept their oscars with dignity , grace and a stiff upper lip , others have not been able to hold back the tears			2
@entity18 is arguably the most famous @entity19 cry baby as she sobbed through her acceptance speech when she won @entity21 for @entity22 in 1999			1
but when she started to thank her family , she could n't stop crying with her voice becoming squeaky and at times inaudible			0
it was thanking her family that reduced @entity48 to tears too when she accepted her @entity19 for best supporting actress in girl interrupted in 2000			1
her voice broke as she sang the praises of her brother , @entity56 , mother @entity53 , who died in 2007 , and her father , actor @entity52 - with whom she has since had a turbulent relationship			0
@entity58 said , ' i 'm sorry , i 'm freaking out ! ' as she wept during her acceptance speech in 2012 when she won best supporting actress for her role in the help @entity64 cried as she accepted the @entity19 for best actress in 2004 for her role in monster @entity68 struggles to compose herself as she accepts her best actress award for @entity70 in 2003 @entity28 gave @entity18 a run for her money as the biggest blubber when she received her best actress award in 2002 for @entity75 - making her the first black woman to be given the honour			1
' @entity79 , ' she sobbed with tears streaming down her face , ' this moment is so much bigger than me			1
' @entity83 could barely start her speech in 2007 when she won the best supporting actress award for @entity86 as she was so overcome with emotion			2
' @entity79 , i just have to take this moment in , i just can not believe this , look what god can do , if my grandmother was here to see me now ... ' she gushed			0
@entity93 can be forgiven for her tears as she won best actress in @entity96 in 2011 as she was pregnant at the time and at the mercy of her hormones			0
@entity83 could barely start her speech in 2007 when she won the best supporting actress award for @entity86 as she was so overcome with emotion @entity93 was pregnant when she won in 2011 and became teary when she thanked her husband for giving her her greatest role yet - motherhood @entity103 choked on his words during his speech in 2013 as he became emotional as he won @entity19 for @entity106 , which he produced , directed and starred in @entity107 looks teary backstage in 2013 as she poses with fellow winner @entity108 ... perhaps @entity83 's tears came as she recalled this embarrassing fall as she took to the stage when she won she sniffed her way through an otherwise eloquent acceptance speech with tears in her eyes as she thanked her husband @entity116 for giving her the greatest role of all as a mother			1
@entity58 was given a standing ovation as she accepted her gong in 2012 for the help and the reaction meant she struggled to speak though most of her speech			0
' i 'm sorry , i 'm freaking out ! ' she wept			0
@entity29 maintained her composure when she made her acceptance speech in 2013 when she won for her role in @entity127 but it all caught up with her backstage when she burst into tears at the photocall clutching her gold statue			1
@entity68 , @entity64 and @entity32 are other notable a-listers who wept as they won their @entity0			2
actress @entity133 should be used to the emotional rollorcoaster of the @entity0 with 19 nominations and three victories under her belt , but here she sheds a tear as she hugs @entity139 on stage in 2003 @entity141 has tears in her eyes as she gives her acceptance speech after winning in 1998 @entity144 looks teary backstage as she poses with her award in 2001 but it 's not just the women who have struggled to hold back the tears			1
@entity103 struggled to contain his emotions as @entity106 - which he directed , produced and starred in - won the @entity19 in 2013			0
he became emotional as he thanked his wife - actress @entity150 - for working hard to make their marriage last and his voice broke as he dedicated the award to their children @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159			0
