by @entity0 published : 20:06 est , 9 january 2014 updated : 05:35 est , 10 january 2014 workers who retire this year will be an average of £ 3,000 a year worse off than their friends , family and colleagues who retired at the start of the financial crisis , a report reveals today			1
the so - called ‘ @entity11 ’ - those who plan to retire over the next 12 months - typically expect to receive £ 15,800 a year			1
but this is £ 2,900 less a year , equal to £ 8 a day , than people who retired in 2008 , the year that the recession began but before it had wreaked havoc on people ’s retirement plans			2
workers who retire this year will be an average of £ 3,000 a year worse off than their friends , family and colleagues who retired at the start of the financial crisis , a report reveals today			2
posed by models crucially , the ‘ @entity31 ’ retired before the @entity32 decided to cut the base rate to an historic low of 0.5 per cent , the lowest level in its 320 - year history			1
yesterday - for the 58th consecutive month - the @entity32 ’s interest rate setting committee voted to keep the base rate frozen at this level			1
the decision was made in march 2009 in a move which has crippled people ’s savings with interest rates paid by banks and building societies on their nest eggs close to zero			0
it is the longest period during which the @entity32 has decided not to raise interest rates since the aftermath of the @entity45 when it was stuck at 2 per cent for 12 years			1
to make matters worse , the true impact on people retiring today is even worse if the figures are adjusted to take into account the crippling increase in the cost of living			0
region annual retirement income * @entity54 : £ 18,400 @entity55 : £ 17,800 @entity56 : £ 16,500 eastern : £ 15,800 @entity57 : £ 15,500 @entity58 : £ 15,300 @entity59 & the @entity60 : £ 15,100 @entity61 : £ 14,700 @entity62 : £ 14,000 @entity63 : £ 13,900 @entity64 : £ 15,800 * as predicted by people planning to retire this year source : @entity67 since 2008 , prices have risen by nearly 20 per cent , according to the report from the insurance giant , @entity67			1
while the ‘ @entity31 ’ retired with an average income of £ 18,700 a year , a person retiring this year would need an annual income of £ 22,400 to have the same spending power			1
@entity75 , a retirement expert from the @entity67 , said : ‘ inflation is eroding pensioners ’ spending power in real terms			0
’ for millions of pensioners , the main problem is that they might have saved as much money in their pension pot - but get much less money when they use it to buy an annuity , an income for life			0
in january 2008 , a 65 - year - old man cashing in his £ 100,000 pension pot would have received an annual income for life of £ 7,341			1
today a man with the same pot of money would get only £ 6,099 a year , a drop of 17 per cent , according to the financial advisers @entity97			2
@entity98 , from the campaign group save our savers , said : ‘ throughout the crisis , the @entity32 has shown utter contempt for the effect of their policies on savers and pensioners			0
‘ what they view as economic theory is lifetime hardship for many people at the most difficult time of their life			0
’ the report , based on interviews with 7,821 people aged 45 and over , including 1,010 who plan to retire this year , asked people how much they expect to receive every year when they retire			2
income from their state pension , any other pension , such as a company pension , and their savings were included			0
other types of income , such as money from a buy - to - let property or earnings from a part - time job , were excluded			0
the report reveals significant regional differences , with the best - off pensioners in @entity54 getting £ 18,400 a year compared to the worst - off in the @entity63 on only £ 13,900 a year .			0
