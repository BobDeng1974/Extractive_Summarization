by @entity0 if this is n't the world 's most intimidating looking sea creature , then we are yet to see what is			2
hauled from a depth of close to 800m below sea , this @entity8 shark was given a very public reception recently when it was shown to more than 1,500 onlookers in the @entity13 city of @entity14			1
a crowd of happy - snapping @entity13 spectators witnessed the four - metre monster undergo a public autopsy when it was cut open outside the city 's @entity19 recently			1
however - despite the mysteries of its anatomy , there is certainly no denying its size and grotesque appearance			2
it is believed the @entity8 shark can can reach a maximum length of five metres			1
the animal spends most of its life swimming at great depths only rising to the surface at night to feed			2
how is it real ? a public autopsy was conducted to reveal more about the biology behind @entity8 look , but do n't touch : a piece of the shark was shown to the eager onlookers gathered to see what the commotion was about careful : the @entity53 has been seen only 57 other times and was first caught at a depth of 165 metres off the coast of @entity57 and there are certainly no prizes for guessing how this marvel of the sea got it 's name with a mouth like this one 's			1
according to a website on the animal 's biology , its chief prey is shrimp - like krill			0
it also feeds on planktonic animals , including euphausiid shrimps , copepods , and the @entity75			0
it devours its prey by filtering the small fish through the inner lining of its gills			0
this sighting - the 58th ever - is the 13th time that a @entity84 has been caught in @entity13			1
the first was caught at a depth of 165m off the coast of @entity57 , when its teeth became caught in the anchor of a large research vessel , according to the @entity90 of @entity91			0
the museum even houses a specimen of its own , which was found washed up on the coast of @entity91 back in august 1988			0
there are several other sharks which have been found washed ashore either dead or dying , and around one quarter of the 58 sighted were caught by fishermen for human consumption			0
in a recent tribute to the @entity53 , the @entity100 even gave prominence to the animal during one of its acclaimed @entity106 features , calling it an ' alien shark			1

it is just the 58th sighting ever recorded of the @entity8 shark
more than 1,500 spectators gathered to watch a public autopsy
