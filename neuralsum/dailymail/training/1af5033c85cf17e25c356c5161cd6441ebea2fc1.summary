a court today upheld a three - month suspended prison sentence against @entity2 after he described the @entity4 occupation of @entity5 as ‘ not especially inhumane '			1
the court decision could not have come at a worse time for the notorious politician , as his daughter is hoping to run for @entity5 president in the @entity11			0
@entity12 took over the leadership of the far right @entity14 ( @entity14 ) last year , modernising its image and trying to underplay its connections with racism and anti-semitism			1
controversial : a court today upheld a three - month suspended prison sentence against @entity2 , pictured with his daughter @entity12 yesterday , after he described the @entity4 occupation of @entity5 as ' not especially inhumane ' today , the @entity23 confirmed mr @entity2 ’s sentence , which also included a 10,000 euro fine			1
in 2005 , mr @entity2 had told @entity27 magazine that ‘ in @entity5 , at least , the @entity29 occupation was not especially inhumane , even if there were a few excesses - inevitable in a country of 550,000 square kilometres			1
’ in fact , thousands died after imprisonment and torture at the hands of the @entity38 , including some 70,000 @entity39 who were deported from cities like @entity23 to concentration camps			0
mr @entity2 , who has previous convictions for @entity44 denial , was not present for the court ruling			0
in 2002 , mr @entity2 , a former @entity5 paratrooper , sent shockwaves around @entity47 after coming second in the presidential election to @entity49			0
last year , he handed over control of the @entity14 to his daughter , and she is currently running third in the polls , with around 20 per cent of the vote			1
she needs to get the backing of at least 500 mayors across @entity5 to confirm her candidacy and appears on course to do so			0
close : mr @entity2 's conviction is bad timing for @entity12 , who took over the leadership of the @entity14 last year , modernising its image and trying to underplay its connections with racism and anti-semitism mr @entity2 founded the @entity14 in 1972 and has since been convicted of racism or anti-semitism on a number of occasions			2
in 1987 he described the @entity4 gas chambers as ‘ a detail of history ’ , and has always been a vehement opponent of allowing foreigners into @entity5			0
ms @entity72 has maintained her father 's anti-immigration policies , and is particularly critical of concessions being made to @entity5 ’s sizeable @entity77 community			2
however , she has rejected most of his anti-semitism , and believes that the @entity14 now represents working - class fears about @entity47 and globalisation			2
she remains extremely close to her 83 - year - old father , who is expected to campaign for her before the april / may two round - election .			1
