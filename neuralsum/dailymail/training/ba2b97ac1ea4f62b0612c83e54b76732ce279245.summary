brain tissue has been made in a laboratory for the first time amid hopes the work could aid research into dementia and head injuries brain tissue has been created in a laboratory for the first time amid hopes the work could aid research into dementia and head injuries			1
so - called brain ' doughnuts ' made from partitioned nerve cells and fibres have been grown by scientists in the @entity20			1
in future , they could be used to study damage caused by injury and disease , improve understanding of brain function , or aid the development of new treatments			2
they could also provide an alternative to distressing tests conducted on animals			1
each doughnut ' ring ' consists of neuron cell bodies , while bundles of connecting axon fibres fill the centre			2
the structures , measuring up to 1.2 centimetres across , mimic the kind of compartmentalisation found in a real brain			2
professor @entity44 , who led the bioengineers at @entity46 in the @entity20 , said : ' there are few good options for studying the physiology of the living brain , yet this is perhaps one of the biggest areas of unmet clinical need when you consider the need for new options to understand and treat a wide range of neurological disorders associated with the brain			1
' to generate this system that has such great value is very exciting for our team			0
' until now neurons have only been grown in a haphazard , unstructured fashion in the laboratory			0
the new approach replicates the complex organisation of real brain tissue , which segregates itself into regions of ' grey ' and ' white ' matter			1
grey matter consists of nerve cell bodies while white matter is made up of axons , the long fibres that carry nerve signals			1
to make the doughnut , the scientists cut a spongy silk protein scaffold into a ring shape and seeded it with rat neurons			0
the middle of the doughnut was then filled with a collagen - based gel			0
in just a few days , the neurons formed functional networks around the pores of the scaffold			0
they also sent axon projections through the centre gel to connect with neurons on the opposite side			0
eventually a distinct white matter region formed in the centre of the doughnut that was separated from the surrounding grey matter			0
tests showed that the brain - like constructs could be kept alive in the laboratory for more than two months			1
experiments that involved dropping weights on to the doughnuts from varying heights demonstrated their potential for studying brain injury			0
the results of work carried out to create brain tissue for the first time has been described by researchers as ' very exciting ' ' with the system we have , you can essentially track the tissue response to traumatic brain injury in real time , ' said @entity121			1
' most importantly , you can also start to track repair and what happens over longer periods of time			0
' he added : ' the fact that we can maintain this tissue for months in the lab means we can start to look at neurological diseases in ways that you ca n't otherwise because you need long timeframes to study some of the key brain diseases			2
' co-author professor @entity137 , also from @entity46 , said : ' this model provides a unique opportunity for mapping out real - time neurophysiological events and function studies in the laboratory , monitoring that is prohibitive with humans or animals			1
' details of the research appear in the journal @entity149 .			0

brain tissue created in laboratory for first time by researchers in @entity20
tissue takes form of ' doughnut ' made from partitioned nerve cells and fibres
the work could *accelerate* research in to head injuries and dementia
it may also provide alternative to distressing tests conducted on animals
