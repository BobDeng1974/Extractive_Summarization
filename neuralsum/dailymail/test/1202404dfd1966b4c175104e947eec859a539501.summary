@entity0 took victory in a play - off at the @entity3 when @entity4 saw a four - foot putt lip out			1
@entity0 , who started the day six shots off the lead but ripped through the first half of the course to make the turn in 29 , had moments before missed from 10 foot but 2008 winner @entity4 could not save par to take the play - off to a third hole			1
overnight leader @entity16 , who hit a fine putt to par the 18th and make it a three - way play - off , had been eliminated on the first hole			2
@entity0 poses with the @entity3 trophy after a thrilling climax saw him take the title @entity0 bumps fists with his caddie to celebrate winning the @entity3 after two play - off holes @entity4 watches his putt go by the hole on the second play - off , handing the title to @entity0 @entity16 's one - shot overnight lead evaporated almost before he had time to warm up on the course thanks to @entity0 ' blistering start			1
six birdies on the first seven holes saw @entity0 tear into an outright lead as @entity16 was easing into proceedings with his second par in as many holes			2
@entity0 picked up a further shot on the eighth on his way to finishing the front nine on a seven - under 29 to tie the nine - hole course record with @entity45			1
the 32 - year - old had a less prolific back nine , but he still picked up two further birdies , with a bogey on the 16th his only blot on a fine day 's golf			0
he returned to the clubhouse with a two - shot lead having carded 64 , but back - to - back birdies on 13 and 14 saw @entity16 join @entity0 on 16 under overall with four holes remaining			1
@entity0 began the day six shots off the lead but stormed up the leaderboard with a brilliant start overnight leader @entity16 saw his advantage go before he was on the course , but made a play - off the 21 - year - old , who could have gone second in the world rankings with victory in @entity65 , just missed taxing birdie shots on 16 and 17 to take it all down to his final hole			1
and just after his tee shot narrowly avoided the bunker , @entity4 dramatically birdied the par - four 18th with a 25ft putt to card a 69 and create a three - way tie at the top of the leaderboard			2
@entity16 still had the chance to win it outright but found a bunker , and he needed a fine 42ft chip and then a 12ft putt to rescue par and join the play - off			0
once it began , things quickly went south for the @entity81			0
he found the greenside bunker with his second shot , and then made a poor shot out from a difficult lie , claiming something had distracted him during his backswing			0
he would be eliminated with a bogey			0
@entity4 had also run into trouble with his second shot but salvaged a par , and when @entity0 missed from 10ft they headed back to the tee to try again			1
@entity16 was the first to drop out in the play - offs , after bogeying the first hole to fall out of contention @entity4 celebrates his birdie at the eighteenth , to earn a place in the play - off , but he fell just short neither man had dramas on the way to the green this time but @entity0 got much closer to the hole with his second approach shot , and after @entity4 over-hit a long putt @entity0 again had the chance to win it from 10ft			1
his putt drifted a couple of inches wide but @entity4 's putt from four feet lipped out and @entity0 could celebrate			2
' i knew i had to play a really low round to have a chance , but i started out great and it worked out for me , ' @entity0 said on @entity116 4 before turning his attention to next week 's masters			0
' it 's great any time you get a week where you can win going into a major			0
i went there monday and tuesday and saw the course so hopefully i 'm ready			0
i 'm hitting it well , and looking forward to it			0
