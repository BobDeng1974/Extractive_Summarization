by @entity0 the most outlandish theory hanging in the moist heat of @entity3 was that @entity4 is staging one of the cleverest heists in a career of clever heists by talking down the sport he spent a lifetime transforming			1
the theory goes that he is criticising the lack of noise from the new @entity15 engines because he wants the value of @entity17 to fall			1
he will then orchestrate the purchase of the majority share in the business at a reduced price and remain in charge for the rest of eternity			1
his willing accomplice , so the conspiracy runs , could conceivably be @entity27 , the @entity28 owner , a fellow billionaire , friend and recent critic of the quieter engines			1
centre of attention : @entity4 , in @entity34 this weekend , could be staging a heist of the sport stunning plot : @entity4 , who turns 84 in october , has been critical of this year 's quieter engines @entity17 's current majority owners , @entity40 , could then wash their hands of @entity4 before a @entity43 court reaches a verdict later this year on whether their octogenarian billionaire chief executive bribed a @entity43 banker called @entity47 the last time the sport was sold , in 2005			1
according to the script , @entity49 , who possess a veto on these matters , would be induced onside , @entity4 would stay in overall control and @entity28 's team principal @entity56 would be tutored to take over if the old boy ever actually died			1
after all it could be doing no more than stirring up controversy - in this case about something he fervently believes in , namely engine noise			2
@entity65 : @entity27 ( left ) would be @entity4 's willing accomplice while @entity56 would be tutored to take over when the 83 - year - old passed , according to the outlandish theory it is an old tactic of his that has made the @entity17 soap opera rival @entity70 with its cast of heroes , lunatics , cheats and @entity75			1
but everything that happens in @entity17 has a reason behind it			2
and @entity4 talking down the product he sells is like @entity80 telling you the video recorder that 's fallen off a lorry wo n't switch on			1
so , maybe , the buying it back story is not so mad after all			0
anyway , in his usual spirit of mischievousness @entity4 said he would like to get the noise levels up , adding : ' i wish i could get it up			1
' he is 84 in october			0
on a day when @entity92 ' @entity91 finished practice at the top of the timesheets to reinforce their status as favourites to win the @entity34 @entity98 tomorrow , @entity4 was hearing for real what the fuss was all about - the engines - for the first time			1
he had previously only heard them in the @entity49 factory and on his television set at home a fortnight ago during the staging of the season - opener in @entity109			2
here he declared them ' slightly better ' than he had imagined - a result , to a degree , of the grandstand opposite the garages providing improved acoustics			0
that was about as generous as he got			0
on track : @entity91 , who won in @entity118 , was fastest in practice for sunday 's @entity34 @entity98 did you hear that ? @entity92 star @entity122 drives past the @entity124 pit - wall on friday he said : ' mr @entity125 , the @entity126 promoter , is here and he told me that if the public do n't like the engines then they will definitely stop hosting the race			2
' @entity133 in @entity118 is not happy			0
the @entity134 are not happy			0
here , they are well down on public tickets			0
people go to @entity17 races for the atmosphere and the noise			2
i am not happy with what we have but we have to deal with it			0
' i asked @entity144 ( the @entity49 team principal ) if anything can be done about it			0
he said he would ask his engineers but it is probably too late now			0
i said we should get the engineers goldplated playstations and send them to a desert island to play with them instead of building engines that are great pieces of equipment we do n't need			0
' steady : @entity28 's @entity155 was third in the timesheets on friday @entity56 agreed that the sport is in need of an image makeover after the fallout from @entity109 - naturally enough as it was his driver , @entity161 , who was disqualified for an alleged breach of the fuel - flow pressure			1
he said the rules were too complex for easy digestion by fans			0
he instead argued that the rule on fuel - flow pressure ( of all tedious things ) should be done away with and teams allowed to use their 100kg of fuel any way they liked			0
the sagacity of his suggestion was reinforced by the fact that @entity161 's new sensor failed during practice , underlining @entity28 's belief the equipment being used by the @entity181 is not reliable			1
they will argue as much at an appeal hearing on april 14			0
their form yesterday was encouraging : their world champion @entity155 was third fastest , a place ahead of @entity91 's team - mate @entity122 and a place behind @entity49 's @entity190			2
so will @entity28 again defy the @entity181 if they believe the sensor is at fault ? ' hopefully , we can agree something with the @entity181 that is sensible ' , said @entity56 non-commitally .			1

theory cites @entity4 wants the value of @entity17 to decrease
@entity4 and @entity27 would then purchase majority share , with the 83 - year - old *supremo* remaining in charge of @entity17
@entity28 's @entity56 would eventually be tutored to take over
@entity4 wants the noise levels of this year 's cars to increase
@entity56 claims sport is in need of makeover following @entity109 fallout
