@entity0 will pledge to lower the voting age to 16 , following the trial of the idea in the @entity5 referendum			1
the @entity7 leader , who has long been a supporter of an earlier voting age , is expected to use a speech at next week ’s party conference to pledge that the policy will be included in his general election manifesto			1
such a move – the first change in the voting age since 1969 – would enfranchise more than 1.5million 16 and 17 - year - olds			1
party sources believe that idealistic youngsters are more likely to vote @entity7			1
the idea is also backed by the @entity20			0
it is also opposed by the conservatives			0
a @entity7 source last night said that the policy ’s place in the manifesto was ‘ set in concrete ’			0
shadow justice secretary @entity36 said : ‘ despite warnings from the sceptics , 16 - and 17 - year - olds did come out and vote and engage in the big issues over the future of @entity5			1
‘ this is all the more reason why the voting age should be lowered for all elections as it is an idea whose time has come			2
‘ @entity7 has been calling for a lowering of the voting age for some time , and after the referendum there ’s little reason why it should n’t be full steam ahead for all elections			2
’ shadow cabinet minister @entity53 , a leading figure in the no campaign in @entity5 , said that @entity7 should now press for a change in the law in time for next year ’s election			0
mr @entity53 said the experiment in @entity5 had ‘ blown out of the water ’ the idea that 16 - year - olds were not engaged enough with politics to be trusted with the vote			1
‘ they have been so engaged , so switched on , ’ he said			0
‘ if there ’s still time for the next election , let ’s give 16 - and 17 - year - olds the vote			1
otherwise , you ’re going to have 16 - year - old @entity5 , who have voted today in the biggest decision that will ever be taken , having to sit out and watch			2
’ the voting age in @entity75 was reduced from 21 to 18 in 1969			0
@entity77 chairman @entity76 dismissed calls to lower the voting age to 16 when the issue was raised last year			2
mr @entity76 warned the move would ‘ politicise the classroom , with votes for youngsters who are still at school ’			0
he also accused @entity7 of bowing to the demands of its union paymasters over the issue			0
last year @entity90 , which is @entity7 ’s biggest donor , demanded that 16 - year - olds should be given the vote			1
the union , run by @entity95 , said : ‘ young people should be given a stake in the political process by lowering the voting age to 16			2
’ an exit poll of just over 2,000 @entity5 voters by @entity103 peer lord @entity102 showed that the 16 and 17 - year - olds enfranchised for the first time by the @entity5 referendum were overwhelmingly in favour of independence			1
the small sample – which may not have been representative of teenagers overall – showed that 71 per cent of the age group voted yes			0
in contrast , only 27 per cent of over- 65s voted in favour of independence in lord @entity102 ’s sample			0
the figures suggest that school pupils are indeed more likely to vote for radical options placed in front of them			0
but this did not carry through to the next age group – the split between @entity125 for 18 - to 24 - year - olds was virtually even in the exit poll .			1

@entity0 expected to pledge to lower voting age to 16 in conference speech
the move would enfranchise more than 1.5million 16 and 17 - year - olds
party sources believe youngsters are more likely to vote @entity7 than @entity103
but polls show the public , and most 16 - year - olds , do not support the idea
