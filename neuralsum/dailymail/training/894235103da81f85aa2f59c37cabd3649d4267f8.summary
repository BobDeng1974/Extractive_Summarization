by @entity0 published : 11:57 est , 19 july 2013 updated : 12:00 est , 19 july 2013 for decades scientists believed that dinosaurs were cold blooded			1
this is because many were thought to have been direct descendants of cold - blooded reptiles such as crocodiles			2
new research from scientists at the @entity10 casts serious doubts on this theory and they claim dinosaurs such as the @entity14 were actually warm blooded like birds and mammals			1
the researchers add that if the dinosaurs did have cold blood they have would not have had the required muscular power to prey on other animals as they did throughout the @entity23 period , and could not have competed well against mammal - like dinosaurs of the same size			1
@entity27 scientists believe that dinosaurs such as the @entity14 ( pictured ) had warm blood like birds and mammals			1
they claim that if they were cold - blooded they would n't have had the muscular power to chase food or run from predators dinosaurs living during the @entity23 period - between 252 and 66 million years ago - include the @entity14 , @entity33 and @entity34			1
the current school of thought believes that dinosaurs behaved like saltwater crocodiles			0
large saltwater crocodiles can achieve a body temperature above 30 degrees by basking in the sun , and it can maintain the high temperature overnight simply by being large and slow to change temperature			0
scientists believe that cold blooded dinosaurs could have done the same and enjoyed a warm body temperature without the need to generate the heat in their own cells through burning food energy like warm blooded animals			1
however , professor @entity53 from @entity10 's @entity54 questions how much muscular power could be produced by a cold - blooded crocodile - like dinosaur compared to a mammal - like dinosaur of the same size			1
in his paper , professor @entity53 demonstrated that a 200kg crocodile can produce only about 14 per cent of the muscular power of a mammal at peak exercise and this fraction seems to decrease at larger body sizes			2
professor @entity53 questions how much muscular power could be produced by a crocodile - like dinosaur compared to a mammal - like dinosaur of the same size			2
saltwater crocodiles ( pictured ) have a reputation for being extremely powerful animals but are n't as strong as they appear the saltwater crocodile is the largest of all living reptiles and the largest terrestrial and riparian predator in the world			0
they live in salt water , mangrove swamps , estuaries , deltas , lagoons and parts of rivers			0
the males grow to seven metres long and weigh as much as 2,000 kg. they have the strongest bite of any animal today and are ambush predators			0
saltwater crocodiles are about 50 per cent muscle but produce less power than a mammal at peak exercise			0
saltwater crocodiles can weigh over a tonne and being about 50 per cent muscle , have a reputation for being extremely powerful animals			0
however , they are not as powerful as they look			0
scientists at @entity103 , the @entity104 and @entity105 in the @entity106 drew from blood and muscle lactate measurements from the crocodiles			2
professor @entity53 of the @entity110 of @entity111 and environmental sciences , said : ' much can be learned about dinosaurs from fossils but the question of whether dinosaurs were warm blooded or cold blooded is still hotly debated among scientists			1
' ' the results further show that cold blooded crocodiles lack not only the absolute power for exercise , but also the endurance , that are evident in warm blooded mammals , ' said professor @entity53			1
cold blooded crocodiles lack the power for exercise and the endurance that are evident in warm - blooded mammals			1
a crocodile - like dinosaur could not compete well against a mammal - like dinosaur of the same size , said professor @entity53 ' so , despite the impression that saltwater crocodiles are extremely powerful animals , a crocodile - like dinosaur could not compete well against a mammal - like dinosaur of the same size			0
' @entity139 dominated over mammals in terrestrial ecosystems throughout the @entity23			0
to do that they must have had more muscular power and greater endurance than a crocodile - like physiology would have allowed			2
' his latest evidence adds to that of earlier work he did on blood flow to leg bones , which concluded that the dinosaurs were possibly even more active than mammals .			0

for decades scientists believed dinosaurs were cold blooded
@entity27 scientists now claim that if the dinosaurs did have cold blood they would not have had the muscular power to prey on other animals
