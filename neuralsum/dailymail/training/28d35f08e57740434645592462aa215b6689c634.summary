published : 05:28 est , 22 january 2014 updated : 12:29 est , 22 january 2014 families face being ' clobbered ' by a rise in interest rates , it was warned today as unemployment fell to within a whisker of the target set by the @entity8			1
a record number of people found work in the three months to november , as the economic recovery builds a head of steam			1
it means the unemployment rate fell sharply to 7.1 per cent , just above the 7 per cent target set by bank governor @entity18 when he could consider putting up interest rates			1
the unemployment rate fell sharply to 7.1 % , putting it within a whisker of the 7 % target set by the @entity8 when it could consider putting up interest rates surprise figures today show an extra 280,000 people had a job in the last three months - the largest quarterly increase since records began in the 1970s			1
in a huge boost for @entity31 's economic plan , there is now a record 30.15 million people in work			2
it comes after the @entity35 said @entity36 would grow faster than any other @entity38 country			0
prime minister @entity39 said on @entity40 : ' the biggest quarterly increase in employment on record			2
more jobs means more security , peace of mind and opportunity for the @entity36 people			2
' in the @entity51 today he said cuts in public spending meant the government was able to offer voters tax cuts , which when they were taken in to account meant people were better off than in 2010			0
mr @entity39 told @entity59 leader @entity58 : ' we are cutting taxes for everyone in this country and we are only able to do that because we have controlled spending			0
what you can not face is the fact that the economy is improving			0
' the fact is today our plan is working			0
there are 1.3 million more people in work in our country			0
that is 1.3 million more people with the security of a pay packet			0
we are securing @entity36 's future and it would be put at risk by @entity59			0
' but mr @entity58 claimed many voters were facing a cost of living crisis as inflation continued to rise at a faster rate than wages			1
a delighted @entity39 said the record number of new jobs was proof the government 's economic plan is working of the 280,000 new jobs created from september to november , 220,000 were full - time - reversing a trend where many people were forced to take part - time work			1
there was a fall in the number of people working part - time because they could not find full - time jobs - down by 12,000 to 1.4 million			2
the number of people claiming jobseeker 's allowance in december fell by 24,000 to 1.25 million , the lowest figure for almost five years			0
however the biggest shock was the fall in the unemployment rate , down from 7.4 per cent in august - october to 7.1 per cent			1
an extra 280,000 jobs were created in september - november , the largest quarterly increase since records began in the 1970s young people should be prepared to take lowly jobs in coffee shops if they want to get on in life , the employment minister has said			1
@entity116 said jobseekers need reminding that they have to start at the bottom and work their way up , rather than expecting to walk into their dream job			0
in an interview with the @entity123 , she admitted that young @entity36 are less prepared for the world of work than foreign migrants and need to learn the basics , such as turning up on time			0
but she insisted that those who want to work hard can succeed if they are prepared to learn the ropes and ‘ be realistic ’ about their abilities			0
asked if they should be prepared to take ‘ entry - level jobs ’ , she said : ‘ absolutely			2
you could be working at @entity137			0
but in a couple of years ’ time you might say , “ i ’d like to manage the area ” or might even want to run a hotel in @entity141			0
’ @entity8 governor @entity18 had said that unemployment would have to reach 7 per cent before he would consider putting up interest rates			1
it had been expected by the end of 2016 but it now seems almost certain to happen in the first half of this year			0
@entity149 general secretary @entity148 said : ' it 's encouraging to see another big fall in unemployment , particularly amongst young people who until now have n't benefited from rising job levels			2
' but while headline unemployment is within a whisker of the @entity8 's forward guidance threshold , an early interest rate rise would clobber mortgage - holders and businesses - jeopardising our economic recovery			1
' mr @entity18 has in recent weeks rowed back from the idea of a sudden increase in interest rates , which could trigger a sharp rise in mortgage bills for families still not enjoying the benefits of the recovery			2
in an attempt to quell fears of a sudden rate rise , minutes of the @entity8 ’s meeting released today showed members of the nine - strong monetary policy committee ( @entity176 ) ' see no immediate need to raise rates ' regardless of the plunging unemployment rate			1
new figures today also show wages are up just 0.9 per cent , while the @entity183 rate of inflation tracking the rise in living costs is at 2.1 per cent			1
employment minister @entity116 said : ' creating jobs and getting people into employment are central to our economic plan to build a stronger , more competitive economy , so it is very encouraging news that we ’ve seen a record - breaking rise in employment over the last three months – the largest ever			1
' with the highest quarterly fall in unemployment since 1997 , it ’s clear that the government ’s long - term economic plan to get people off benefits and into work so they can secure their future is proving successful			2
' @entity59 's shadow work and pensions secretary @entity206 said : ' today ’s fall in overall unemployment is welcome			2
the government should use this opportunity to tackle the unacceptably high levels of long - term unemployment and youth unemployment			0
' more than 900,000 young people are unemployed and over 250,000 young people are long - term unemployed			0
the @entity8 's monetary policy committee ( @entity176 ) has said it will not lift interest rates above their historically - low level of 0.5 per cent until the unemployment rate drops to 7 per cent			1
@entity8 governor @entity18 will come under pressure to make clear if interest rights will rise this year as @entity149 leader @entity148 warned a rise would ' clobber ' families analysts had not expected the threshold to be reached until later in the year , although the @entity8 has since stressed a figure of 7 per cent will not automatically trigger an interest rate rise			1
dr @entity230 , director of @entity231 , said : ' it 's now inevitable that unemployment will soon fall below the @entity8 's forward guidance rate of 7 per cent			1
' however , the weakness of pay growth suggests there is still a considerable amount of slack in the labour market which for the time being remains an inflation free zone			0
better news on jobs is no reason for an early rise in @entity36 interest rates			1

extra 280,000 jobs in three months to november , biggest rise on record
biggest shock was the unemployment rate falling to just 7.1 %
@entity8 will consider interest rate rise when it hits 7 %
