@entity1 is now ' the biggest health problem facing our world in a generation ' , @entity0 said today			1
the prime minister warned other countries to ' look to their responsibilities ' to help tackle the epidemic ravaging parts of @entity11 amid growing anger at the lack of international support in the fight against the deadly virus			2
it came after the international development secretary @entity18 warned that other countries needed to ' wake up ' to the threat of @entity1 and start helping to combat it			1
the @entity35 medical ship @entity36 , which has a fully - equipped 100 - bed hospital on board , set sail from @entity40 to @entity41 to join the humanitarian effort and is due to reach the area by the end of the month			1
but its facilities will not be used to treat @entity1 patients themselves but will be there in case any of the @entity24 military and civilian personnel working in the region become ill or are injured during the course of the operation			2
@entity24 has taken on responsibility for fighting the outbreak in @entity41 , while the @entity26 are leading in @entity56			1
the @entity25 government has agreed to take on the lead role combating the disease in its former colony of @entity61			0
but the prime minister said @entity64 secretary - general ban ki - moon had been right to call for other countries to deliver more in the way of funding and resources			2
' this is the biggest health problem facing our world in a generation			0
it is very likely to affect a number of the countries here today , ' mr @entity0 said as he arrived for the 50 - plus nation @entity77 in @entity78 , @entity79			1
' the action we are taking in @entity41 where we are committing well over £ 100 million , 750 troops , training 800 members of health staff , providing 700 beds - we are doing a huge amount			2
' i think it is time for other countries to look at their responsibilities and their resources and act in a similar way to what @entity24 is doing in @entity41 , @entity26 is doing in @entity56 , @entity25 is doing in @entity61			1
other countries now need to step forward with resources and action because taking action at source in @entity11 is the best way to protect all of us here in @entity102			2
' the @entity36 left @entity24 for the @entity103 of @entity11 today as the government ramped up its efforts to combat the outbreak of the disease royal @entity109 crew and members of the @entity112 paraded on the deck of @entity36 as it leaves @entity115 today service personal stood to attention on the deck @entity119 as it left the @entity40 harbour today on its way to @entity41 for a six month deployment to help combat the outbreak of @entity1 the public turned out to see off the @entity36 , which will act as a ' floating hospital ' off the coast of @entity41 the government 's demand for greater international support came after after mr @entity131 , the @entity64 secretary general , said last night that a ' huge and urgent global response ' was needed to deal with the crisis and that countries which have ' the capacity ' should provide funding now			1
' this is quite serious			0
we need an urgent global response and support , ' he said			0
while some £ 12.4 million has been pledged to a trust fund set up by mr @entity131 , only 100,000 dollars has so far been received			2
mr @entity131 's predecessor as secretary general @entity144 said he was ' bitterly disappointed ' at the scale and speed of the international community 's response to the crisis			0
' if the crisis had hit some other region it probably would have been handled very differently , ' mr @entity144 told @entity153 's @entity152			0
' in fact when you look at the evolution of the crisis , the international community really woke up when the disease got to @entity26 and @entity102			2
' i point the finger of blame at the governments with capacity ... i think there 's enough blame to go around			0
' @entity24 and the @entity26 are the biggest international contributors to the fight against @entity1 international development secretary @entity18 said more needed to be done to fight the @entity1 outbreak development secretary ms @entity18 backed mr @entity131 's remarks			1
she said : ' for countries that are n't playing a leading role we need them to start providing resources			1
' ' of course @entity175 is quite right to say we need the rest of the international community to now provide support , channelled through the @entity26 trust fund that 's been set up			2
' the appeal is there in support of governments like the @entity24 and the @entity26 … it 's in support of enabling those strategies to be able to be scaled up			1
' ms @entity18 backed @entity64 secretary general @entity175 's call for other countries to do more			0
she said : ' he is right to say that many more countries need to get involved			0
it is simply not going to be a tenable approach to simply leave the @entity24 to work with @entity41 , to leave the @entity26 to work with @entity56 , @entity25 to work with @entity61 and no other countries get involved			1
' now i think it 's fair to say that actually there is now movement , @entity194 is starting to provide funding			0
' the international community now needs to wake up to this crisis , and start putting resources into working with the @entity24 , and the @entity26 , in particular , to help deliver our strategy which we believe will be successful			1
' international health workers are trying to combat the @entity1 outbreak in the high risk @entity207 of @entity209 , @entity56 the @entity26 has taken responsibility for tackling the disease in @entity56 , with @entity24 taking the lead in @entity41 and @entity25 in @entity61 @entity24 and the @entity26 have so far contributed the bulk of the cash for the fight to contain the outbreak , jointly providing almost £ 600million @entity218 boss @entity217 had contributed more money to the fight against @entity1 than @entity221 – while @entity223 founder @entity222 had stumped up half as much as the @entity25 government			1
ms @entity18 said the @entity24 was as ' well - prepared as any country ' in preventing the spread of @entity1 reaching @entity102			0
' we have very robust systems in place , we had a training exercise with the @entity231 over last weekend to put those plans into action and test them			0
' people should be clear that the risk to the @entity24 remains low , but we are prepared and we 're as well prepared as any country			0
we 've introduced screening at our airports , we 're the only @entity102 country to have done that so far			0
' she said the best thing the government could do to minimise the risk to @entity24 was to work with the government of @entity41 to ' tackle @entity1 over there in first place '			1
the ship is fitted with enough medical equipment to act as a floating hospital as good as any @entity231 institution ms @entity18 said : ' we 've got a large programme now that is underway ... it includes building treatment beds , and some of the military personnel heading out on @entity255 will be helping us deliver those			0
that will provide treatment , not just for @entity1 patients , but for healthcare workers			0
and if they get infected , we will now have much better capability in helping them recover			0
' she said @entity24 would be building 700 treatment beds which would triple the number of beds that @entity41 currently has			1
a naval ship with a 100 - bed medical complex and loaded with helicopters , landing craft , tonnes of emergency supplies and almost 400 personnel left the @entity24 today to head for @entity41			1
@entity119 , a vast hospital and support vessel , set sail from @entity276 in @entity40 to @entity11 and act as a forward base for army medics , engineers , soldiers and aid experts who will build and operate medical centres , train local doctors and nurses and transport vital supplies			1
by the end of next month 750 @entity24 troops will be operating in @entity41			1
with troops continuing to withdraw from @entity290 it will be the largest overseas deployment of @entity24 forces anywhere in the world			0
during a visit to the 28,000 - tonne @entity36 the defence secretary , @entity295 , described the ship , which first saw action during the @entity299 conflict , as a ' warhorse ' embarking on a vital humanitarian mission .			2

countries other than @entity24 and @entity26 need to ' start providing resources ' for fight
mr @entity0 says countries need to ' look at their responsibilities '
development secretary adds other governments need to ' step up to plate '
@entity24 and the @entity26 are leading the global fight against the disease
