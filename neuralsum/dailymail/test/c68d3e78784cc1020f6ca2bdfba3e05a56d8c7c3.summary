the mother - of - five who was arrested for allegedly throwing her 16 - year - old daughter a drunken party where they played naked twister together has admitted to turning towards alcohol during her divorce from her veteran husband			1
@entity10 , 35 , had been a life - long follower of the @entity12 church and had never touched a drop of alcohol before her split from her husband @entity16 , who was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder when he returned from @entity18 , her lawyer said in a statement on thursday			1
but following their divorce last year , she began drinking and ultimately broke away from the church , where she had once been a sunday school teacher , the lawyer said			2
her alcohol abuse culminated in the startling incident in which she allegedly allowed her daughter and her friends to drink alcohol and smoke marijuana in front of her at their @entity33 , @entity36 home			1
according to authorities , @entity10 and the teenagers then played naked twister - although @entity10 left halfway through the game to have sex with an 18 - year - old man in the bathroom			1
when she returned , she brought out sex toys and started to use them on herself in front of the teenagers , @entity53 reported			1
after going to bed , she awoke around 3.30am to find her daughter 's 16 - year - old boyfriend raping her and immediately threw him off , according to @entity61			1
the girl later told her mother that she felt guilty because his 10 - inch penis was too big for her , so he had to have sex with her mom instead , according to a police report			2
according to @entity61 , @entity10 woke the next day and realized that her drinking had got out of hand and had led to her being raped by the 16 - year - old			1
her daughter has now split from the boy			0
video from @entity75 arrested : @entity10 , pictured in her mug shot , was arrested after she told her aa sponsor about the incident and the sponsor then contacted authorities			1
@entity10 said she is working to put it behind her split : her lawyer said @entity10 , who is a life - long @entity12 , turned to drink after divorcing from her husband @entity85 , pictured right			1
he returned from @entity18 with ptsd and was later discharged , the lawyer said after the incident , the children 's paternal grandparents found out about the party from the teenage girl and were awarded custody of the five children			1
@entity10 was arrested after sharing details of the incident with her @entity98 sponsor , who then went to authorities			1

the person is then required to make amends for past wrongdoings , as long as doing so does not cause harm to others			0
while there is an expectation of anonymity at meetings , there is no guarantee , and experts recommend exercising caution when detailing crimes , according to @entity123			0
@entity98 literature simply states that ' anonymity provides protection for all members from identification as alcoholics '			0
the main ' @entity131 ' booklet does not mention safety from disclosure of a crime and there have been multiple cases of @entity98 members being convicted of crimes , including , murder after confessing to their sponsors			0
but there has also been some debate over whether the confessions can be used in court			0
in 2001 , a 1995 murder conviction was thrown out after it was ruled that a killer 's confession to fellow @entity98 members was constitutionally protected and should n't have been used against him			0
the decision was reached after the judge deemed the @entity103 had religious undertones , meaning that the members engaged in religious activity , which is constitutionally protected			0
@entity10 's lawyer said she was shocked with what had happened so she researched local @entity98 groups and met with a sponsor , named @entity159 , who encouraged @entity10 to tell her about her divorce , her drinking and the incident that led to her losing her children			1
@entity10 also allegedly told the sponsor that she had shown her daughter explicit photos , including of @entity10 having sex with her current boyfriend , and admitted to being a porn addict			1
@entity159 then went to authorities and told them what the mother - of - five had confessed to doing at the party			2
@entity10 's lawyer called @entity159 's decision to go to the sheriff 's office ' unfortunate '			1
@entity10 was arrested last saturday and charged with two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor			0
@entity61 , the lawyer , released a statement shared by @entity53 on thursday , saying @entity10 was ' extremely remorseful ' for what had happened			2
' mrs. @entity10 acknowledges that due to recent alcohol abuse she engaged in several acts of inappropriate conduct , ' he said			2
' although , many of the allegations are exaggerated , she is extremely remorseful for what she allowed to occur in her presence and is obtaining professional and pastoral counseling to ensure that this conduct is never repeated			0
' he denied that she had thrown the party for the teenagers or provided them with drugs , and said she would be fully cooperating with authorities			0
' mrs. @entity10 has recommitted herself to her faith and her family , ' he continued			0
' she is hopeful that her children , members of her faith and others will learn from her poor example as to just how easy it is for people to exercise such extremely poor judgment while intoxicated			0
' he did not comment on the naked twister , bathroom sex or sex toy allegations , and simply said reports of the incident had been exaggerated			1

the unit , part of the @entity248 , co-ordinated @entity250 and @entity18 security force missions in the south of @entity18 after @entity253 forces left and @entity250 troops were deployed there to deal with the @entity256 militia which took control of the city			0
he was later based at @entity259 , in @entity260 , @entity261 and more recently , the @entity264 - @entity263 area of @entity36			2
but due to his ptsd and anger issues , he was ultimately discharged and is now on @entity268 disability , according to mrs @entity10 's lawyer			1
according to her sponsor , who went to police , she also allegedly used sex toys in front of the teenagers and showed her daughter explicit photos of her having sex with her current boyfriend neighborhood : she was already drunk when her daughter and her friends came back to the neighborhood , pictured , because they had been staying at their father 's , she said the couple separated in 2014 and she kept custody of the children			1
