@entity2 @entity1 star @entity0 says he accepts that his stature as @entity4 and his desire to be outspoken about indigenous rights makes him a target for personal racist attacks			1
in the past week @entity0 was racially abused by an @entity10 fan , booed during the clash despite making no wrong moves , and was the victim of a series of vicious online attacks			1
however , the 34 - year - old has vowed to not back down in his role as an indigenous leader , even if that means he 's subjected to further abuse			1
' i actually feel i 've been in training for this role , to be honest , ' @entity0 said at a media conference at the @entity25 on thursday			2
' yeah , i 'm putting my neck out there and , at times , people want to knock it off			0
but i 'll continue putting my neck out there because there are so many good people out there who are supporting the messages , who want to see some changes			0
' despite some criticism about his front - foot - forward approach to dealing with discrimination , the @entity2 star maintains silence is not the answer			1
' unfortunately , some people do n't want to have those conversations - they might not be ready			0
but i 'm definitely ready , ' he said			0
' it 's not a comfortable thing to talk about ; definitely it 's not a comfortable thing to go through			0
it 's going to cause a stir and it 's going to cause people to have conversations , but let 's talk about it ... once we talk about it , see what it 's like , then we can self - regulate and say that 's not right			2
' in the past week the star @entity2 player has been racially attacked both at a game and on social media @entity0 was with his mother unveiling the new guernseys for the indigenous round , which the player 's mum @entity80 designed @entity0 was at the cricket ground with his mother @entity80 to unveil the @entity2 ' jersey for indigenous round that 's been designed by her			1

this is the first time the @entity2 will play in a different jersey for the indigenous round , and the design pays tribute to @entity0 ' late @entity92 ' these sort of comments are appalling , shocking and a stark reminder that we still have work to do in this area , ' @entity2 chief executive @entity120 told @entity127			1
' racism has no place in society			0
not on the football field , not in the stands , not on social media and not anywhere else			0
' the positive from the weekend was the willingness of crowds to stand up and not tolerate this sort of behaviour , regardless of their allegiances			0
' according to the @entity101 , fellow indigenous footballer @entity141 took a number of screen grabs of the comments and posted them to his @entity147 account			0
' @entity0 is a hairy monkey and deserves his place on this list , ' was one of the comments shared by the disgusted @entity153 forward			1

' @entity1 boss @entity194 said @entity166 's comments would be investigated , but his position at @entity178 remained in tact			0
at the time @entity0 singled the young fan out in the crowd , @entity166 stood united with him in their bid to stamp out racial vilification in the game			2
he reacted by stepping in to support @entity0 and even shook his hand in the dressing room after the final siren went			2
but all his good work was undone when the @entity209 radio presenter made a terrible error in judgement by suggesting @entity0 be flown down from @entity2 to @entity212 to help promote @entity169 the musical			1
@entity214 : @entity0 has suffered numerous racist attacks during his illustrious football career according to @entity218 reports , @entity0 said he would still be prepared to shake @entity166 's hand , but would not regard the gesture as an act of friendship			1
