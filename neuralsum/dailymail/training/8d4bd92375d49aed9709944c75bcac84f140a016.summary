this was a tale of two young talents , @entity3 of @entity4 via @entity5 and @entity6 of @entity7 via @entity8			1
both cost their clubs somewhere between £ 1m and £ 2m			0
ings alone went home happy			0
the former @entity14 forward scored the two early goals that gave @entity4 their second straight win in the @entity17 and their first away win in the top division since april 2010			2
and @entity6 , as he is more routinely known , gave the home supporters something to take away from a disappointing result – entertainment and hope of better things			0

6.5 attendance : 27,018 the last time @entity4 won away in the top division , in their last one - year stay , the hosts were @entity86 , the score was 4 - 1 and the victory nowhere near enough to keep the @entity4 in the elite division			1
this triumph , in which @entity7 briefly threatened a comeback with a goal from @entity41 , lifts @entity4 off the foot of the table and within sight of safety			1
‘ we scored two very good goals , high quality goals on the break in the first 15 minutes , ’ said @entity4 ’s manager @entity97			1
‘ then @entity7 came at us in waves — they never stopped coming at us			2
but we had the will , desire , respect , honesty and team ethic — all the qualities i think are the marks of a good team			2
’ on winning two matches on the bounce now , and the belief that it gives in a shot at survival , @entity97 added : ‘ everyone tells me that back - to - back wins in the @entity17 are massive and i ’ll accept that			0
survival has been deemed impossible and our job is to make it possible			0
’ @entity7 ’s @entity122 said : ‘ unfortunately we lost the game in the first 10 or 15 minutes when we did n’t get a grip on what the opposition would do to us			1
you need to be rock solid in that period			0
’ @entity97 made just one enforced change to the starting xi who sealed the first win of the season last time out , against @entity86			0
@entity135 , injured in training , was replaced by former @entity7 winger @entity36 , who made the most of his chance			1
@entity4 started brightly , careering forward early , albeit without much bite for the first 10 minutes			1
then they scored twice in two			0
for the opener , @entity70 took possession out on the left from @entity143 and slipped in a low ball			2
@entity7 ’s goalkeeper @entity43 , under pressure from @entity36 , pushed it into the path of @entity3 and the 22 - year - old forward tapped in			1
@entity7 defender @entity44 challenges @entity66 of @entity4 in the game at the @entity151 @entity6 ( left ) tried to spark a @entity7 comeback in the second half as his side chased an equaliser but failed to get a point @entity4 manager @entity97 ( left ) shakes hands with @entity7 boss @entity122 ( right ) before kick - off between the two sides @entity61 ( left ) of @entity4 slides in to block an attempted delivery from @entity7 's @entity6 ( right ) @entity36 ( left ) and @entity68 ( right ) challenge @entity7 midfielder @entity162 ( centre ) for possession @entity4 's @entity70 ( centre ) escapes from @entity7 midfielder @entity48 ( right ) and shoots at goal referee @entity81 is surrounded by players as tensions heated up towards the end of the match @entity7 threw on @entity53 ( right ) as they tried to get back into the game , but he could not improve his team 's fortunes @entity7 manager @entity122 looks dejected as he leaves the pitch at the @entity151 on full time @entity3 ( left ) celebrates @entity4 's victory alongside team - mate and goalkeeper @entity60 ( right ) on the full - time whistle the visiting fans , packed behind the goal where the ball nestled , erupted in delight – and less than a minute later they were doing it again			1
@entity36 was the provider the final ball again coming in from the left , and this time going straight to @entity3 at the back post , who converted another opportunity on a plate			1
@entity6 , 24 , once rated as a £ 30m ‘ next @entity194 ’ at @entity8 was eye - catching with his flicks and tricks			0
it was the @entity196 ’s cross that dropped to @entity41 , who powered home with a diving header .			2

@entity3 put @entity4 ahead on 12 minutes after an error from @entity7 goalkeeper @entity43
he *doubled* @entity4 's *advantage* a minute later after good work down the left from @entity36
@entity41 headed in for @entity7 on 32 minutes but @entity4 held on and frustrated the hosts
