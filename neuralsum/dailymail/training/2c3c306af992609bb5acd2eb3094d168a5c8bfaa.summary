by @entity0 two of the @entity3 ’s biggest denim brands are claiming that yoga pants are encroaching on their territory – and affecting their sales as a result			1
@entity9 ’s ceo @entity8 and @entity11 ’s president and ceo @entity12 have both made comments about how the leggings ’ popularization as an everyday item has lessened consumers ’ demand for jeans			1
‘ we ’re actually losing consumption to yoga pants , ’ mr @entity12 told @entity26 last week , adding : ‘ what used to be a premium jeans occasion for women is now socially acceptable to be a yoga pants occasion , and shame on us as a category leaders for letting that happen			1
’ taking over : ceos for both @entity34 have commented that they are losing sales to yoga pants , and the style 's affiliated lifestyle continues to gain popularity the brand ’s numbers tell that exact story			1
@entity11 ’s has experienced a near $ 3billion fall in revenues since 1995 , which have now stalled at $ 4.6billion			2
mr @entity12 ’s comments were echoed in those made by mr @entity8 during @entity9 's fourth quarter earnings call in february , reports the @entity49			1
“ as more and more trends start to push women , in particular , towards street attire , we start looking at the balance between the athletic part of our business and the going - out part of the business and … [ activewear ] is the new denim , ’ mr @entity8 said on the call of how @entity9 plans to integrate a stronger athletic focus into its business			1
‘ what used to be a premium jeans occasion for women is now socially acceptable as a yoga pants occasion ’ specifically , the company ( which also operates @entity68 and @entity69 ) is rolling out a massive expansion of @entity71 , its activewear brand which has grown from one store in 2011 to 65 stores in 2013			1
according to @entity49 , @entity9 plans to open 100 more @entity71 locations by the end of this year			0
the brand ’s merchandise echoes the polished , slightly upscale feel that one might find at @entity80 , with $ 50 sports bras and $ 100 microfiber leggings			0
the popularity of @entity71 , as well as @entity80 and smaller activewear companies like @entity85 make it clear that when working out , a tattered t - shirt and shorts will no longer suffice			0
left behind : @entity11 's ( whose factory is shown here ) has lost nearly $ 3billion in profits in the last decade - partially due to the rise of yoga pants new focus : @entity34 's ceo says that the company is now focusing on innovation as a way to draw back consumers , and offers its best - selling ' commuter pant ' ( pictured ) which boasts odor and water resistant fabric , as proof that these efforts are working adding to the fire are how brands like @entity107 and @entity108 have just rolled out their own athletic offerings – both indicative of their labels ’ mantras with neon florals for the former and batik prints for the latter			1
cumulatively , these brands show how the modern gym experience somewhat replicates today ’s ongoing health food boom ; which has taken the earthy - crunchy vibe out of nutrition and reproduced its principles with a slick package of $ 12 juices and $ 20 kale salads at @entity124 restaurants and the like			0
bottom line : it is now cool to be healthy , and those who gladly shill out on health foods are begging for a wardrobe to match			0
it represents a new aspirational lifestyle full of $ 200 private yoga sessions , $ 100 leggings , and $ 75 - dollar - a - day cleanses , leaving little time or budget for jeans			0
the denim industry may have initially responded to the trend early - on with the rise of the jegging in 2009 , but those styles have since fallen out of favorability following multiple spoofs by everyone from @entity145 to @entity146			0
permanent fixture : many occasions in which women once preferred to wear jeans are now solely dedicated to yoga pants , with many wearing the leggings outside the gym the demand for yoga pants during the work day has become so intensified that in january , @entity158 released a stretchy dress pant that could be worn at a desk or on the floor of an asana room			2
but what does this all of this mean for denim ? according to mr @entity12 , innovation is the way to return to the forefront of consumers ’ minds – and cut through the yoga pant clutter			2
‘ it ’s our job to get them back , ’ he said of shoppers			0
the ceo is so insistent on technological advancement , that he has taken a page from @entity178 ’s book by opening an innovation lab within @entity11 ’s @entity181 headquarters			2
offering proof of its accomplishments , mr @entity12 says one of @entity11 ’s current best - sellers is its ‘ commuter ’ pants , which were designed for urban cyclists and boast water - repellent , odor - preventing fabric , as well as reflective tape			1
the brand is about to flood its stores with a new design that utilizes super-soft stretchy jeans as well			0
will they make a steadfast appearance at sunday brunches nationwide ? that is yet to be seen .			0
