like many of those facing a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis , @entity0 was willing to try anything to be well again			1
the property developer from @entity7 , @entity8 , had been an avid three - times - a - week gym - goer when , in 2004 , he was given the devastating news			0
just 53 at the time , he had started feeling tired , and his foot began dragging when he walked			1
after being referred to a neurologist in june 2005 , the diagnosis was finally given : primary progressive multiple sclerosis			1
@entity16 sufferer @entity0 , pictured with his wife @entity17 at their home in @entity8 , who has been refused the cannabis spray @entity23 one of the more uncommon forms of the disease , affecting only 15 per cent of sufferers , it causes a steady decline as symptoms worsen			1
the condition , in which the immune system attacks the central nervous system , slowly robs sufferers of their balance , movement and speech , causing stiffness , numbness , insomnia , pain and exhaustion			2
there was little doctors could do to help @entity45 and he was drawn by desperation into the murky world of alternative medicine – paying more than £ 20,000 for bogus treatments in @entity50 and @entity51 that had no effect on his condition			2
finally , in late 2010 he saw an article online about a new drug called @entity23			1
the oral spray is derived from the cannabis plant – but without any of the associated dangers or side effects – and works by dampening down the over-activity in the nervous system that damages the muscles , inhibiting movement			1
‘ i mentioned it to my neurologist , who said , “ you ca n’t get it in this area			0
if you want it you have to buy it privately			0
” so he gave me a private prescription			0
i went to my local chemist who charged me £ 550			0
’ the supply lasted just six weeks , but the effects were almost immediate			0
‘ within a few days i could feel the benefit and after a couple of weeks my symptoms were almost completely gone			0
i ’d say i was 80 per cent better , ’ says @entity45			2
but , unable to get an @entity83 prescription , after three months @entity45 could no longer afford the treatment			1
to add to his misery , he found that a few miles away at @entity89 in @entity90 , @entity16 patients with symptoms similar to his are being prescribed the drug			1
the cannabis spray @entity23 has n't been assessed by the @entity93 so funding decisions for the drug are not uniform across the @entity83 according to dr @entity96 , consultant in pain management at @entity98 in @entity99 , @entity23 can not only alleviate existing problems but could hold back the progression of @entity16 ‘ @entity23 is licensed only for the relief of spasticity [ tightness in the muscles that affect movement ] and found effective in half of cases , ’ he says			1
‘ many patients have discovered what @entity45 did : it also relieves other symptoms , such as chronic insomnia			0
’ a major review of trials last december concluded there was insufficient evidence to warrant @entity23 ’s routine use with @entity16 , yet dr @entity96 is convinced of its effectiveness			1
‘ we found that patents have substantially improved sleep , ’ he says			0
‘ studies on animals have shown some reduction in disease progression			2
we know it has an effect on protecting the nervous system			0
’ the problems have arisen because of the way certain clinical commissioning groups ( @entity133 – the bodies that have replaced primary care trusts ) do their sums			2
a single bottle costing £ 125 will contain 90 sprays			0
the drug has not yet been assessed by the @entity83 guidance body , the @entity93 – which means funding decisions are not uniform across @entity142			1
the result is that it is not being prescribed widely			2
earlier this year , @entity145 charity the @entity144 found that just two in 100 patients were using a symptom - reducing treatment such as @entity23			1
@entity148 , head of policy and campaigns at the @entity144 , says : ‘ we know that @entity23 is not being prescribed in some areas and in other areas it is			1
we think this is down to @entity133 making their own decisions at a local level			2
’ in 2011 the @entity159 and @entity158 – an independent advisory group that provides guidance on pharmaceutical treatments in the @entity163 – recommended against prescribing @entity23 , stating there was ‘ inadequate evidence for efficacy and / or safety ’			1
@entity168 insists : ‘ their decision , which has triggered similar ones elsewhere , is based on inaccurate analysis of the data , and on the cost impact of the treatment rather than cost effectiveness			0
we wrote to them to highlight this but the committee has not reviewed the policy			0
‘ prescription rates for @entity23 in the @entity145 are low			1
it is a licensed treatment for @entity16 and has undergone extensive clinical testing that found it to be safe and effective			0
we strongly believe eligible people should be given the opportunity to try treatments that could benefit them			0
’ @entity45 turned to a nurse for advice			0
‘ she told me other patients buy cannabis and mix it into cakes			2
’ he refuses to consider this option			0
‘ if there ’s a drug that ’s legal – @entity23 – and that works for me , why ca n’t i get it on the @entity83 ? the future for me looks grim			1
’ dr @entity96 is equally angry			0
he says : ‘ when you find patients , as i have , whose lives are transformed by this drug you ’re left wondering : are we prepared as a society to leave people in often agonising pain ? or do we provide them with a medicine that might help them ? ’ the virus trigger @entity16 is believed to be genetic – but not necessarily inherited – and triggered by environmental factors such as viruses and a lack of @entity214 only two per cent of @entity145 ’s 100,000 @entity16 sufferers have a parent with the disease .			1

@entity0 was just 53 when he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis
his uncommon form of the disease affects just 15 per cent of sufferers
*mr* @entity227 was refused @entity23 on the @entity83 while sufferers living a few miles away are being prescribed the cannabis spray
the drug has n't been assessed by the @entity93 – meaning funding decisions are not uniform across @entity83
