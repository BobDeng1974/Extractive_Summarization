by @entity0 published : 13:03 est , 28 august 2012 updated : 18:54 est , 28 august 2012 a retired schoolmaster took his own pillows and duvet into a new £ 170million hospital wing because he was so shocked by the conditions in which his son was being treated			1
@entity7 , 74 , said his son @entity8 , 50 , was ' shivering ' under blood - stained sheets at the @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12			1
he also claimed that , when he raised concerns about mess on the ward , a nurse told him cleaners had refused to come in because they feared catching an infection			1
disgusted : @entity7 brought his own pillows and duvet into the hospital because he was so alarmed at the conditions in which his son @entity8 was being treated it is alleged that one nurse even joked to @entity24 that he would be ' lucky to make it out alive '			1
@entity27 's health secretary @entity26 , who officially opened the hospital wing yesterday , has described the alleged incidents as ' completely and utterly unacceptable ' , and an investigation is under way			1
mr @entity7 , of @entity32 , @entity12 , made the complaint while his son , a diabetic , was receiving treatment for porosis of the stomach - a condition whereby his stomach often rejects food			1
he took matters into his own hands by visiting a nearby shop and buying fresh pillows and a light duvet			2
patient : @entity24 , who is being treated at the hospital for porosis of the stomach , claimed a nurse told him he would be ' lucky to make it out alive ' mr @entity7 said : ' they said he could n’t get an extra blanket or pillow because people had been stealing them			1
' it was the same for the man in the next bed who has terminal cancer			0
' there was blood on the pillow and blood on the sheets			0
the blood had turned black it was so old			0
' credit to the nurse			2
when i raised it she changed it straight away			0
' but there was also debris on the floor , stuff like dust , and bits of paper			0
' when i complained about this , the nurse said the cleaners wo n’t come in in case they catch an infection			2
' the ward was colder than normal because of a fault with the wing 's new heating system			2
mr @entity7 , a retired teacher for the deaf , said he also offered to purchase bedding for the gravely ill man in the bed next to his son , but the patient had already contacted his own family in a desperate bid to keep warm			1
he said : ' my son , like each one of my children , is so important to me and the thought of him suffering makes me upset and very angry			0
' we just had to speak up so that something was done and no one else has to endure this			0
' you pay taxes hoping that when you need to use public services they will be there - but it 's simply not the case			0
desperate measures : @entity7 said he had to buy fresh bedding for his son after finding him ' shivering ' under blood - stained sheets at @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 ' to think @entity26 was swanning around pretending everything was great when this was all happening behind the scenes is just unbelievable			1
' mr @entity7 said his son was transferred to another ward over the weekend but had still had trouble getting extra bedding			1
speaking from his hospital bed , @entity24 said he had been ' utterly dumbfounded ' by the ' shocking ' level of care			1
he revealed that at one stage a male nurse even joked to him that he he would be ' lucky to make it out alive '			2
i could n't believe what he was saying to me , ' he said			0
' he had been moaning on about having to do his job and then , when he had to clean something off the floor , he made some remark to me and the chap beside me about the level of cleanliness and said we would be lucky to make it out alive			2
' that is not an appropriate thing for a nurse to joke about			0
' i have to have surgery later this week and it certainly did n't fill me with confidence			0
' the member of staff has been reported to management			0
inquiry : health secretary @entity26 has described the alleged incidents at @entity11 's @entity10 as ' completely and utterly unacceptable ' @entity24 said : ' i was visited by the head of nursing , who apologised personally and assured me an investigation was to take place but it 's really too little too late			1
' they spend millions and millions on a fancy new building but do n't want to fork out for vital things such as clean bedding and enough staff			0
' when asked about the allegations , ms @entity26 said : ' obviously i do n’t know all the details on this individual case but if that is the case then it ’s completely and utterly unacceptable			1
' @entity12 's director of nursing , @entity162 , said they were aware of mr @entity165 ’s complaint and were investigating			2
mr @entity7 's complaint comes only a week after a patient at @entity168 , in @entity169 , @entity170 , was told her operation was cancelled because medics had run out of bandages			1
the woman , who asked not to be named , said that she spent more an hour being prepared for the operation before being told it was off			0
a spokeswoman for @entity178 said it was ' sorry ' that the operation was ' unable to proceed due to a temporary delay in the delivery of certain sterile bandages from the national @entity184 distribution centre ' .			0
