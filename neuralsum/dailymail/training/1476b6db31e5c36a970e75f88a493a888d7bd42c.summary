@entity1 's iconic @entity0 moved a big step closer to getting an oft - debated suicide barrier after bridge officials on friday approved a $ 76 million funding package for a net system that would prevent people from jumping to their deaths			1
the bridge district 's board of directors voted unanimously in favor of the funding for a steel suicide net , which includes $ 20 million in bridge toll revenue			1
federal money will provide the bulk of the remaining funding , though the state is also pledging $ 7 million			2
a tearful @entity19 , of @entity20 , who lost his son , @entity21 , to suicide on the bridge in 2008 , said after the vote that he was almost speechless			1
after the vote , he rose from his knees and shared a tearful embrace with @entity40 of @entity41 , whose son @entity42 jumped off the bridge in 2010			1
' we did it , @entity19 ! we did it ! it 's no longer the @entity49 anymore , ' she said			2
at least some of the money still requires additional approval			2
the bridge 's board , however , has now taken its final step in adopting the net			1
' the tragedy of today is that we ca n't go back in time , we ca n't save ... the people who jumped off the bridge			1
but the good thing , with this vote today , we can vote in their memory , ' board member @entity60 said			2
' we will save many lives who have followed in their footsteps and that 's what so extraordinary about today			0
' the @entity0 , with its sweeping views of the @entity72 and @entity73 , has long been a destination for people seeking to end their lives			1
@entity77 photographs an exhibit of shoes in remembrance of people who have jumped from the @entity0 during a commemoration of the bridge 's 75th anniversary on sunday , may 27 , 2012 since it opened in 1937 , more than 1,400 people have plunged to their deaths , including a record 46 suicides last year , officials said			1
officials have been discussing a suicide barrier on the bridge for decades			1
the bridge 's board voted in 2008 to install a stainless steel net , rejecting other options , including raising the 4 - foot - high railings and leaving the iconic span unchanged			1
two years later , they certified the final environmental impact report for the net , which would stretch about 20 feet wide on each side of the span			0
officials say it will not mar the landmark bridge 's appearance			1
but funding for the project remained a major obstacle			0
a significant hurdle was overcome two years ago when president @entity112 signed into law a bill making safety barriers and nets eligible for federal funds			0
@entity119 minority leader @entity118 of @entity120 in a statement friday praised the bridge 's board and assemblyman @entity123 , @entity124 , who has been a staunch supporter of a barrier			1
the @entity0 district 's board of directors voted unanimously to approve a $ 76 million funding package to build a net suicide barrier on the iconic span ' the @entity0 is a source of immense pride to @entity1 , but for too many families in our community , it has also been a place of pain , ' @entity131 said			1
' a suicide prevention barrier offers a critical second chance for troubled men and women acting on often impulsive suicidal thoughts			1
together , we can ensure this magnificent landmark stands as a faithful companion for all @entity147 , awing and inspiring visitors for generations to come			0
' most jumpers suffer a grisly death , with massive internal injuries , broken bones and skull fractures			0
some die from internal bleeding			0
@entity158 , who miraculously survived his suicide attempt after jumping off the structure in 2000 at age 19 , urged the board before its vote to " not let one more family sit in eternal pain , in perpetuity because of politics			0
" he later broke down after the unanimous vote approving the funding			0
' i feel like a giant weight has been lifted off my shoulders , all of our shoulders			0
i feel free , ' @entity158 said			0
' i feel a sense of hope that i have n't had in a very long time			0
it 's not over yet , we will be here until that net is raised and no more people die			0
' @entity183 of @entity184 , whose son , @entity185 was among the 46 bridge suicides last year , said while friday 's vote is momentous , he 's not done fighting			2
over 1,500 people committed suicide by jumping from the iconic bridge since it opened in 1937 with 46 people jumping to their death in 2013 ' it 's not over for me			1
i 'm going to keep coming here and urging them to get the barrier done			0
when i go on that bridge and look down and see that net there , then i will be at peace , ' @entity183 said			2
@entity203 , whose 17 - year - old daughter , @entity204 , jumped from the rust - colored span in 2008 , told the board friday that he hopes that some measure is taken before the net is constructed to provide some kind of safety to everybody			2
' what i really do n't want to see between now and the time it is done is more deaths , ' @entity203 said			2
' that will be a cruel irony			0
' board members and @entity1 supervisors @entity219 and @entity220 both agreed that the sooner the barrier is built , the better			0
' we need to build it as quickly as we can , ' @entity219 said			0
bidding on the job is expected to start next year , with completion of construction expected in 2018 .			1

the @entity0 has become a *popular* destination for the suicidal
more than 1,400 have jumped off the bridge to their deaths since it opened in 1937
construction expected to be complete by 2018
