@entity0 : 15:31 est , 21 december 2013 @entity1 : 16:32 est , 21 december 2013 president @entity2 has begun his annual winter vacation in @entity4			1
the president , first lady @entity5 and daughters @entity6 and @entity8 landed in @entity9 shortly before midnight local time			1
their two dogs , @entity13 and @entity14 , joined them aboard @entity16			2
@entity2 has no public events scheduled while he 's in @entity4			2
on previous trips , he 's enjoyed regular rounds of golf , visits to restaurants and family trips to get shave ice , a @entity25 version of a snow cone			2
last year , gridlock in @entity28 forced @entity2 to return to @entity29 the day after @entity30			1
this year the @entity8 are hoping their vacation will go uninterrupted			0
the president , who was born in @entity4 , is scheduled to be in @entity9 through jan. 5			1
' that 's how i intend to approach it			0
i am sure that i will have even better ideas after a couple days of sleep and sun. ' this will be the first family 's sixth @entity30 in @entity4 since he was elected president , and in keeping with tradition they are expected to spend their 17 - day vacation in the @entity69 neighborhood of @entity70			1
the @entity71 announced last week that the @entity8 would depart on december 21 , since it was expected to be a light work schedule for the president in @entity29			1
the first family are spending their sixth @entity30 in a row in @entity4 which will cost taxpayers $ 100,000 the president and his family traditionally spend their @entity30 break in a rented private beach front residence with spectacular ocean views			1
the @entity8 cover the cost of the accommodation that typically costs up to $ 3,500 a day , or $ 75,000 a month , but local and federal taxpayers help pay their travel and security bill which costs in the region of $ 1 million			1
for his first three years in office , the @entity8 rented a $ 24,500 - per - week gated @entity92 , which offered security and privacy on the white sand beach of @entity96			2
since then the @entity8 have rented a few different houses on @entity98 , which has provoked different opinions from those who live in the area			0
christmas traditions : the @entity2 will surely stop by @entity102 in @entity70 for some shaved ice , as they did in 2010 ( pictured ) the @entity2 's will cover the cost of their accommodation , but local and federal taxpayers help pay their travel and security bill ' it 's exciting			1
it 's really an honor to have him here , and when he 's around – actually the place is super safe because we have all this security around , ’ @entity110 , who lives locally , told @entity116			0
' we go through two security points and so the second one , we have to get out of our car			0
we have to be searched ourselves , plus our car has to be completely searched , ' said a woman called @entity121 , who has lived on the street for more than four decades			0
when the president visits , the canal running through the @entity125 neighborhood is off limits and is patrolled by @entity128 and a @entity130 cutter is positioned in the bay			0
it is one of the many security measures put in place , including military blockades on the beach and security checkpoints along the street where he stays			0
island time : president @entity2 is pictured with his daughters and other kids as they head down to the beach during their vacation last year ' i understand he 's the president and so he needs his security , but i 'd like for him to pick next year another spot			0
this would be really nice , ' said @entity121			0
' at first it was exciting , but now it 's no longer exciting			0
' last year , @entity2 was forced to cut short his vacation and fly back to @entity29 on the day after @entity30 to resume negotiations on an emergency budget deal with @entity28			1
this year , @entity28 is on track to approve a two - year budget deal before the @entity30 holiday and so he is n't scheduled to return to @entity29 until january 5 .			2

the first family left @entity29 friday for their annual @entity30 trip to @entity4
@entity16 greeted with warm *reception* at @entity9
the @entity8 are expected to spend a little more than two weeks on @entity69 in the president 's home state
the trip will cost taxpayers an *estimated* $ 100,000 , although the @entity8 pay for their own accommodation
