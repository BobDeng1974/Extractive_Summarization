on the morning of may 31 , 1926 , the coal - powered cargo steamship was transporting a load of grain from @entity103 in @entity20 to @entity21 when a dense fog descended on the calm lake , significantly reducing visibility			1
the @entity14 reduced its speed by half as a precaution , down to 4.5 knots			0
at around 5.30am , the crew aboard the steamer heard the sound of a fog horn , and a few minutes later the @entity23 came into view directly in front of the cargo ship			2
the crew on the @entity2 - built boat rushed to turn it to starboard in a desperate bid to prevent a collision , but there was not enough time			2

high tech search : a remotely operated vehicle was used to obtain video of the shipwreck and identify it as the @entity14 on a mission : the team of shipwreck explores ( from left to right ) @entity59 , @entity63 , @entity65 and @entity67 , who found the @entity40 in august less than 15 minutes after the @entity140 plowed into the @entity14 , the hull of the stricken ship filled with water and the boat sank to the bottom of the lake , making it the largest steel steamer shipwreck			1
@entity23 had just been sold by @entity32 government to @entity145 and was making the trip to the new owners			0
