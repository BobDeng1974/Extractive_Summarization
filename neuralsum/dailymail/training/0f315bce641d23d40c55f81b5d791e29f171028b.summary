by @entity0 , @entity1 editor published : 18:41 est , 3 september 2013 updated : 18:45 est , 3 september 2013 @entity2 has been accused of trying to fool customers over the horsemeat burger scandal by attempting to spread the blame to others			1
the supermarket was the focus of public outrage after it emerged in january that some of its cheap frozen burgers were as much as 29 per cent horsemeat			2
at the time , @entity15 ’s biggest food retailer apologised but suggested it was the victim of a widespread problem , saying in adverts : ‘ it ’s about the whole food industry			1
’ the @entity21 has ruled that a claim by @entity2 that the horsemeat scandal was a problem for ' the whole food industry ' should not be repeated the claim outraged the nation ’s independent butchers , and in a ruling published today , the @entity27 upheld objections to the @entity2 claim that this was a problem for ‘ the whole food industry ’			1
the advertising watchdog said the statement would be understood by consumers to relate to all food retailers and suppliers , rather than @entity2 alone			1
the @entity21 said : ‘ because the ad implied that all retailers and suppliers were likely to have sold products contaminated with horsemeat , and because relatively few instances of contamination had been identified at the time the ad appeared , we concluded the ad was misleading			1
’ as a result , it said the ad breached industry codes and the claim should not be repeated			1
the full advertisement read : ‘ the problem we ’ve had with some of our meat lately is about more than burgers and bolognese			1
it ’s about some of the ways we get meat to your dinner table			2
some of @entity2 's cheap frozen burgers were found to contain as much as 29 per cent horsemeat ‘ it ’s about the whole food industry			1
and it has made us realise , we really do need to make it better			2
‘ we ’ve been working on it , but we need to keep going , go further , move quicker			0
we know that our supply chain is too complicated			0
so we ’re making it simpler ... seriously			0
@entity70 , chairman of the @entity71 of butchers , welcomed the ruling			2
he said : ‘ it was not only @entity2 , but this was a problem of the big boys			1
‘ they were screwing the prices down to demand cheaper products with the result that cutting plants ended up using horse in manufactured products			0
‘ @entity2 tried to mislead customers , but i do n’t think they were fooled			1
‘ people realised it was problem of less trustworthy supermarkets and have changed to the high - end butchers			1
‘ as a result , we have seen a 30 per cent increase in sales			0
the claim that the scandal affected the whole food industry outraged butchers who insist they know the provenance of all of their meat ( file picture ) ‘ this was not a problem of quality butchers , who deal directly with farmers or small , reputable wholesalers			1
’ mr @entity70 said he was surprised that @entity2 and others have not been prosecuted			1
mr @entity70 , whose business is based in @entity107 , @entity108 , said : ‘ it was wrong to sell horsemeat as beef			2
if it was me selling horsemeat in burgers , i know i would have been clobbered by the local authority			2
’ in its defence to the @entity21 , @entity2 produced expert evidence arguing that the contamination was widespread			1
it claimed that while small butchers do source local food , they do not have the resources to audit suppliers to guarantee its authenticity			2
@entity126 has been cleared of breaching advertising rules in a tweet for @entity129			0
watchdogs launched an investigation after receiving a complaint from someone who saw the message when it was retweeted on @entity135			0
they questioned whether the tweet - ' the pitches change			0
the killer instinct does n't			0
own the turf , anywhere			0
@ @entity141 ' and a link to a picture - was obviously identifiable as a marketing communication			0
however , the @entity145 ( @entity21 ) ruled no rules had been broken and cleared the @entity148 and @entity149 footballer of any wrongdoing			0
@entity129 said the inclusion of the ' @ @entity141 ' official @entity135 address would have left people ' in no doubt ' that the tweet was a @entity129 marketing communication , because it directly and prominently referenced the @entity129 brand and its official @entity135 address			0
the @entity21 investigated the tweet in connection with rules regarding ' recognition of marketing communications ' , but did not find it in breach and said no further action was necessary			0
an @entity21 spokesman said : ' we considered the reference to @entity135 was prominent and clearly linked the tweet with the @entity129 brand			0

@entity2 said horsemeat scandal was problem for ' whole food industry '
@entity27 said ad breached industry codes and should not be repeated
claim outraged butchers who say they know where their meat comes from
