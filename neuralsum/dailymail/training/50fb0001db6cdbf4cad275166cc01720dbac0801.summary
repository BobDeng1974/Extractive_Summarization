this is the emotional moment a man who was wrongly imprisoned for nearly four decades for murder met and forgave the young witness whose false testimony put him behind bars			1
@entity6 , 57 , was exonerated in november after spending a staggering 39 years in prison for a crime he did not commit - the robbing and shooting murder of a money - order salesman in 1975			1
his conviction at the age of 18 - which led to him being placed on death row , with his sentence later commuted to life - was largely based on the testimony of a 12 - year - old boy named @entity19			1
at the time , @entity19 claimed under oath that he saw @entity6 pull the trigger - even though he was actually several blocks away on a school bus			1
but in 2013 , he went back on his testimony			2
his conviction at the age of 18 was largely based on @entity19 's testimony as a 12 - year - od a lesson in forgiveness : at the time , @entity19 claimed under oath that he saw @entity6 pull the trigger - even though he was actually several blocks away on a school bus			1
but in 2013 , he went back on his testimony dramatically changing his account , he said : ' all the information was fed to me - i do n't have any knowledge about what happened at the scene of the crime			1
' now , following @entity6 's release on november 21 , the pair have finally met outside of court for the first time in a heart - wrenching encounter that was captured on video by @entity56			1
in the footage , @entity6 beams and holds his hand out as he approaches @entity59 , now 52 , in a church			2
incredibly , he tells him : ' it took a lot of courage to do what you did			2
' the pair then warmly embrace and @entity59 starts sobbing , telling the former detainee : ' i 'm sorry			0
' @entity6 , dressed in a long blue coat , replies : ' it 's all right brother			2
we were both victims man			0
i do forgive you man			0
i wanted to be here personally to tell you that			0
' speaking to the broadcaster after their meeting , @entity19 , who claims police encouraged him to lie in his testimony , said : ' wow , how could this man hug and embrace me after all these years ?			2
' @entity89 at least : @entity6 , pictured speaking to @entity56 this month , nearly seven weeks after his exoneration , told @entity19 : ' we were both victims man			1
i wanted to be here personally to tell you that ' wrongful conviction : @entity6 ( pictured , left , in his police mugshot ) was convicted of the murder of @entity101 in @entity102 , @entity103 , in 1975			1
right , @entity59 , now aged 52 , later admitted his testimony was ' all lies ' crime scene : this photograph shows the aftermath of the murder for which @entity6 was convicted @entity6 was convicted of the murder of @entity101 in @entity102 , @entity103 , in 1975 , alongside two other men who have both since been exonerated : @entity112 , 60 , and @entity113			1
although at the time , police had no physical evidence to link the trio to the killing , they had testimony from @entity59 , who claimed to have seen @entity6 shoot @entity101 with the help of the other two			1
the trio were initially sentenced to death , but their sentences were commuted to life in 1978 after a @entity129 ruling			2
they all spent years behind bars at @entity132			0
indeed , @entity6 's sentence was the longest served for a wrongful conviction in @entity136 history			2
thankful : although at the time , police had no physical evidence to link @entity6 to the killing , they had testimony from @entity59 , who claimed to have seen him shoot @entity142			1
above , @entity6 finds out he has been exonerated @entity143 : when he exited the courthouse , @entity6 said : ' the @entity146 language does n't even fit what i 'm feeling ' however , in 2013 , @entity19 recanted his testimony , saying that police officers coerced him into testifying and gave him details of the case , @entity149 reported			1
' they knew that i did n't see anything , ' he said			0
' everybody knew it was a lie			0
all these years i 've been holding this shame and guilt inside , wanting to come forward and do the right thing			0
' @entity59 - whose unreliable testimony was highlighted in an article by @entity166 magazine in 2011 - eventually confided in his pastor , @entity167			0
he said he had initially fingered @entity6 because he had seen him around the neighborhood			0
in good spirits : @entity6 is pictured shaking hands with well - wishers following his exoneration in november also free : @entity113 ( pictured ) and @entity112 ( left ) were also exonerated for the killing of @entity101 when he dismissed @entity6 's case in november , judge @entity175 said , ' life is filled with small victories , and this is a big one			1
' meanwhile , @entity6 said when he exited the courthouse : ' the @entity146 language does n't even fit what i 'm feeling			0
i 'm on an emotional high			0
' @entity6 is now looking forward to his new life as a free man			0
he has so far applied for a library card and started studying for his driving theory test			0
he has also moved into a new home without bars and set mealtimes .			0
