if you 've ever craved the smell of fast food all day long , @entity1 has come up with the ultimate solution with the launch of a new burger - scented cologne			1
the cologne will supposedly imitate the signature aroma of the @entity10 , which consists of 100 per cent flame - grilled beef , freshly sliced onions , lettuce and mayonnaise			0
the scent , which has been named @entity16 , is set to be launched by @entity1 @entity17 on 1 april 2015			1
there will also supposedly be a one day promotion , whereby every customer will receive a free @entity10 with their purchased perfume bottle			1
it 's apt that the release of the perfume would fall on 1 april ( @entity35 ) , and many have speculated that the ' launch ' is in fact a global practical joke			2
while many people are doubtful of the launch 's authenticity , the fast food chain insists that the upcoming release is not a hoax			0
in fact , this is n't the first time that it 's launched a fragrance			0
in 2008 , @entity1 unveiled a men 's spray , dubbed @entity16 , which was promoted as ' the scent of seduction with a hint of flame - broilled meat '			2
flame was only available online and in certain stores in @entity57 , and was discontinued shortly after its launch			0
april fool 's ? while many people think that the cologne is a hoax , the advert insists the authenticity of the cologne and sees it retailing for 5000 yen , which is around £ 27			1
