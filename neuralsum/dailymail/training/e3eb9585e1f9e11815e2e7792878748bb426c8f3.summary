by @entity0 for many of us , it is the sort of challenge that you might attempt once in your life – a brief throwing of caution to the winds ; a bucket - list box ticked , perhaps never to be repeated			1
but for one undoubtedly brave – and perhaps reckless – @entity13 adventurer , bungee jumping comes so easily that he decided to do it 151 times			2
a man with a crazy plan : @entity17 has time to smile for the camera as he forges out on his world record bid and then he was gone : @entity17 heads towards terra firma as he ticks off another leap from above @entity17 performed his repeated game of chicken with gravity in @entity25 , as part of an attempt to break the world record for the number of jumps in a 24 - hour period			1
and he achieved his aim , smashing the previous high - water mark of 105 , which was set by @entity35 daredevil @entity34 - at the @entity36 , on @entity35 ’s famous @entity37 - in may 2011			1
mr @entity17 is based in @entity25 , and pulled off his feat by leaping from a 100 - metre crane at a bungee facility , @entity41			1
this is attached to the @entity43 , a race - track where adrenaline junkies can drive fast cars amid the dust and sand of the desert emirate			2
prepare for lift - off : @entity17 was attempting to break the previous high mark for the number of bungee jumps in one day , 105 , set in @entity35 three years ago all downhill from here : @entity17 ticked off a remarkable 151 bungee jumps over three different sessions during his 24 - hour challenge the 33 - year - old split his earthbound tumbles into three sessions			1
he began on the evening of ( thursday ) 20 march , jumping from 7pm until 11pm			0
then , after resting for seven hours , he recommenced at 6am on the friday morning , continuing until 10.30am			0
by 10.20am , he had beaten the record , pushing it up by one to 106 – but was not content to leave it at this figure			0
a further session of rest over lunchtime saw him remount the jumping platform for a final burst of rapid descents , between 3pm and the cut - off point at 7pm			0
record broken , let 's do some more : @entity17 set a new high mark with plenty of time to spare - before adding 46 to the prior top total perhaps unsurprisingly , the process left mr @entity17 feeling exhausted			1
‘ i feel a bit beaten up , to be honest , ’ he told @entity77			0
‘ every jump has been different			0
sometimes it ’s a good one , sometimes it ’s not so good			0
’ due to the stresses placed on his body by so many leaps in quick succession , mr @entity17 was forced regularly to change the position of his safety harness , transferring it between his ankles and his chest			2
the ankles tend to be the standard point of attachment in bungee - jump procedure , but staff on hand deemed it necessary to make the switch			2
all smiles , no injuries : apart from a dislocated finger and a sore body , @entity17 achieved his target without any medical concerns ‘ it ’s mostly to stop my ankles from being completely ripped to shreds , ’ mr @entity17 explained			2
‘ neither [ of the harness positions ] are easier , you ’re still getting the same force and sustained pressures on the body			0
’ he did suffer one small injury – dislocating his finger after catching it in his harness , requiring the assistance of a sports therapist , who quickly clicked the errant digit back into place			0
but he was not affected by migraines or dizziness – two unpleasant consequences that could have resulted from so many head - long rushes towards terra firma			1
circles in the sand : @entity17 attempted his record at the @entity43 , a popular race track in the desert emirate mr @entity17 achieved his target with a considerable amount of time to spare			1
in total , he jumped for less than 12 hours , settling for a final total of 151			0
he had hoped to break the 200 - jump barrier , but found that tiredness hindered his efforts			0
that figure was verified by an official from @entity139 – which now has an office in @entity25 , due to the number of world - record bids that are now attempted in a place where biggest , fastest , highest and most have become cherished mantras			1
big boys ' toy : @entity25 is no stranger to great heights and world records , thanks to the towering presence of the @entity152 skyscraper , the tallest building on the planet ‘ the office was opened here because demand was so high for record - breaking events , ’ said @entity155 , the @entity139 adjudicator who monitored the attempt			1
the @entity152 , which opened in @entity25 in 2010 , is , of course , the tallest building in the world , reaching into the heavens at a height of 830 metres ( 2722ft ) .			2

@entity25 - based @entity166 takes on the world record for the highest number of bungee jumps performed in 24 - hour period
previous record of 105 bungee jumps set by adventurer on @entity35 's famous @entity37 three years ago
@entity17 suffered one minor injury during his day - long gravity challenge , but otherwise *emerged* *unscathed*
