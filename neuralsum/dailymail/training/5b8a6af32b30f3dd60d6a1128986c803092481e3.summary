by @entity0 @entity1 : 12:06 est , 10 december 2013 @entity2 : 12:11 est , 10 december 2013 the number of both adults and children surviving cancer is on the rise across @entity8 , but figures show survival still depends on where someone lives			1
although the @entity14 in survival rates has narrowed since 1996 , it is still ‘ persistent ’ , according to a new report from the @entity17 ( @entity17 )			1
data from more than three million people shows that cancer of the oesophagus , bowel and lung have the widest regional variations of people still alive one year after diagnosis			1
the number of both adults and children surviving cancer is on the rise across @entity8 the report reveals there was a difference of more than 10 per cent between regions on these cancers			2
in one example , 68.3 per cent of women in @entity36 and @entity37 with bowel cancer are alive a year after diagnosis , as are 69.4 per cent of those in @entity42			1
but women in the @entity44 fare better , with 79.2 per cent of those in @entity46 , and 74.4 per cent of those in @entity47 and @entity48 , alive after a year			0
meanwhile , in @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 , 29.6 per cent of women with lung cancer are alive a year after diagnosis , but in @entity56 the figure is 40.7 per cent			1
the range in one - year survival between @entity8 area teams was widest for men diagnosed with stomach cancer at 14.2 per cent , the report went on			1
however , at a national level , there has been an increase in survival rates for six key cancers			1
at a national level , there has been an increase in survival rates for six key cancers , including stomach lung and breast cancers the largest improvement in one - year survival among men occurred for oesophageal cancer , where survival increased by 19 per cent from 26.7 per cent for those diagnosed in 1996 to 45.4 per cent for those diagnosed in 2011			1
for women , the largest improvement in one - year survival was for lung cancer , where survival increased by 13 per cent from 21.9 per cent for those diagnosed in 1996 to 34.7 per cent for those diagnosed in 2011			1
the @entity17 also published figures on childhood cancer , showing five - year survival has gradually increased from 66.6 per cent in 1990 to 81.3 per cent in 2006			2
the data covers all children with cancer up to the age of 14			0
last week , figures from @entity8 showed thousands of people eventually diagnosed with cancer may be failed by @entity95 who do not refer them quickly enough			0
although the @entity14 in survival rates has narrowed since 1996 , it is still ' persistent ' figures from around 4,000 gp practices in @entity8 show that , in many cases , only a minority of patients are fast - tracked for investigation by a specialist			1
in some practices , only around one in 10 patients eventually diagnosed with the disease saw a specialist within two weeks			0
the target for the @entity8 says 95 % per cent of patients with suspected cancer referred by their gp must be seen by a specialist within two weeks			0
the data suggests many are not seen on this basis and are eventually diagnosed another way			0
while some gp practices show 100 per cent of patients with cancer making it through the fast - track system , others fall far behind			0
in around half of the practices in the sample , fewer than 50 per cent of cancer patients were seen through the two - week system			0
the largest improvement in one - year survival among men occurred for oesophageal cancer , where survival increased from 26.7 per cent for those diagnosed in 1996 to 45.4 per cent for those diagnosed in 2011 a report by @entity138 has condemned the findings as a ‘ national disgrace ’ and suggested doctors should get financial incentives to ensure they diagnose patients within the target			2
the report by the all - party parliamentary group said there was a gulf between affluent parts of @entity150 and the @entity151 and the rest of the country			0
there was a wide regional variation in urgent referral rates , ranging from fewer than 800 referrals per 100,000 people in areas of @entity150 to nearly 3,500 per 100,000 in the @entity160 and @entity56			2
in @entity162 , premature cancer death rates were more than twice as high as in @entity163 and @entity164 , @entity150 , where fewer than 78 people per 100,000 under - 75s died early			2
@entity160 residents have more than double the chance of being sent for a targeted form of radiotherapy than those in the @entity172 .			0

the @entity14 in survival rates has narrowed but is still ' persistent '
in some areas cancer survival rates are 10 % *lower* than in other areas
data shows cancer of the oesophagus , bowel and lung have the widest regional variations of people still alive one year after diagnosis
