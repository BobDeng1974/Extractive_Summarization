by @entity0 and @entity1 the surrogate mother of @entity3 , who is at the centre of an international storm surrounding the birth of the boy and his twin sister , has given an extensive interview to a @entity12 news program			1
@entity13 , claimed on @entity14 , via a translation for @entity16 , that the agents and doctors caring for were aware that @entity19 had @entity3 early into her pregnancy			1
she also said before she was even implanted with the embryo , the doctors had detected a condition which predisposed her to giving birth to a baby with severe health problems			1
but perhaps the most shocking claim the 21 - year - old made was that the @entity42 parents of @entity19 and his sister - @entity44 and @entity45 - reportedly asked her to abort the children when she was seven months pregnant			1
' it was the agent ... she said that they ( the @entity49 ) wanted to abort both of the children '			2
ms @entity13 told the program , adding she broke down in tears when she received this news			1
' she said that the parents had been very shocked and frightened ... they were insisting on the abortion			0
i said i could n't do that ... cause i was seven months into the pregnancy already			2
' ms @entity13 said she was then given the option to abort just one of the children - the one with a disability - though she still refused this as she believed she was too far into the pregnancy			1
' they told me that the child would have to be injected with some drugs ( or poison ) to take his life and then be taken out by surgical process			0
then the girl would go into the incubator right away ... these words have since then stayed in my head ' , ms @entity70 revealed			2
in an interview with a @entity12 news program , she said @entity44 and @entity45 knew months before she did that @entity19 had down @entity78 also in her interview in @entity12 , ms @entity13 said she believed doctors , agents and the @entity83 knew about @entity19 's @entity3 as early as four months into her pregnancy , but they did not notify her until she started having complications around seven months			1
she said she was sent test results to her home throughout her pregnancy , telling her that her babies were healthy and neither had any disability , mental or otherwise			0
' the agency , the doctors as well as the parents knew ( about @entity19 's @entity3 ) already since the fourth month of the pregnancy ' , ms @entity13 claimed			1
' i was getting sick and had to go and stay in the hospital ... around the seventh month of the pregnancy			0
that 's when they told me			0
but before that they have never mentioned anything about it to me			0
' in their first interview since the scandal broke , the @entity49 said on sunday night they would have asked the surrogate mother to terminate the pregnancy if they had known earlier on about @entity19 's disability			2
however they claimed they knew nothing about his condition until around the seven month mark			2
ms @entity13 also said doctors and her surrogacy agents were aware of a condition she carried which may result in any baby being born with a disability , but they did not notify her in @entity120 , laws on the terminations of pregnancies vary state to state , but in @entity120 - where the @entity49 are from - the four month mark would still be considered a safe time to abort the children as it is legal to have an abortion during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy			1
ms @entity13 , who already has two children of her own , also said she believed she was misled by the agents and doctors in charge of her , as they withheld information about a health condition she had			1
when she underwent blood tests prior to carrying the embryo , they showed ms @entity13 had thalassemia , a common blood disorder that can cause stillbirth , a range of growth and learning disorders and heart failure			2
' nobody told me anything ... i asked the agency that if i had this disease ... would that mean that i should not get into pregnancy ? they said that it was okay			0
the doctor said it was alright ' , she told the program			0
' i did n't know that if you have thalassemia there will be great chances that your child will suffer from down - syndrome			0
if the doctor had told me ... probably i would not have gone through with the procedure			0
' the @entity49 , pictured here with @entity19 's twin sister @entity31 , have been at the centre of the surrogacy scandal after ms @entity13 claimed they left @entity19 in @entity12 because of his disability another twist raised by ms @entity13 was that she originally registered for surrogacy using the identity of her partner 's brother 's girlfriend , as she was three months shy of 20 years old at the time			1
' the agency told that is was okay ... that i could use somebody else 's @entity35 instead			0
i did n't know what they were using my name for ... they just told me that they will need give this name to the clinic ... to register myself ' , she said			0
ms @entity13 claimed she did this as she had little knowledge about the surrogacy process , and only changed her name on the forms after she had to sign documents at the embassy .			1

@entity13 spoke to @entity14 news in an extensive interview
she claimed she was asked to abort @entity19 and his sister at seven months pregnant
ms @entity13 said doctors knew @entity19 had @entity3 as early as four months
claimed doctors and agents knew about a health condition which predisposed her to giving birth to a baby with disabilities
also revealed she used another woman 's identity to register for surrogacy as she was only 19
