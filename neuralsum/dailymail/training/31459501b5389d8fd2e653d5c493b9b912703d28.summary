@entity27 : @entity2 and @entity4 are one of the hottest presidential tickets this nation has ever seen and now there 's proof that its not just their politics dangerous duo : according to professors at the @entity12 , @entity2 scored in the 99 percentile of all politicians , far outpacing his running mate @entity4 , who 's rock hard abs earned him only a spot in the 67th percentile of attractiveness ' @entity2 is better looking than almost everyone reading this , ' professor @entity40 wrote when describing his work			1
in 2007 , political science professors @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity40 presented the faces of prominent politicians to @entity12 students for a split second and had them rank ' how competent ' the person appeared			1
' the students seeing the candidates did not know that they were politicians , ' mr @entity40 told the @entity55			1
' we believe that “ competence ” relates to general attractiveness , thus the fact that @entity2 and @entity60 both do quite well			1
' mrs @entity60 scored in the 95th percentile			1
high ranking : the study was conducted to measure the ' competence ' of politicians and how much , if any , their attractiveness affected the outcomes of their elections			1
@entity60 scored in the 95th percentile ' their answers appear to judge mostly just blunt attractiveness , but it is hard to know exactly what makes somebody think a face is “ competent ” ' , he said			1
' if the election were decided on looks , it would be no contest			1
' professor @entity40 the trio presented all 728 of the governor and @entity85 candidates from 1994 to 2006 to the students , removing the highly recognizable ones so as not to cloud judgement			1
@entity2 's 99th percentile put him below just a few other politicians			1
' only four people scored higher than him : @entity92 , the @entity93 @entity92 senator ; @entity94 , the former @entity95 @entity94 senator ; @entity97 , the former @entity98 @entity3 governor ; and @entity99 , who had run for @entity100 as a @entity3 and is now the lt. governor of @entity102 , ' professor @entity40 said			1
most of those topping the list of best - looking senators were male - the highest - scoring woman was 76 - year - old @entity108 , who came in 14th place			2
highs and @entity111 : @entity93 senator @entity92 , left , is considered the most attractive politician of them all , while @entity114 , right , is considered the least attractive			2
directly below , the most attractive senators are listed above the least attractive ones 2			2

@entity130 ( @entity131 ) at the time of the study , president @entity132 was already too well known , the professor said , so they were only able to size up @entity138			0
he scored in the 62nd percentile			1
' so , if the election were decided on looks , it would be no contest , ' professor @entity40 said			1
' fortunately for @entity132 and @entity138 , the election is not decided by looks			1
as we point out in our paper associated with the study , most of the correlation between candidate appearance and election outcomes is probably spurious			1
' most attractive woman : @entity108 was named the best - looking female senator despite her 76 years of age @entity157 : at the time of the study , president @entity132 was already too well known , the professor said , so they were only able to size up @entity138			0
he scored in the 62nd percentile they ascertain that very few voters will cast their ballot based solely on looks alone , and even if they become more attractive during a race , it will only gain them 3.5			1
' rather than good looks directly affecting voters ’ decisions , it is likely that good looking people like @entity2 have a lot of success in life , obtain significant human capital - education , career success , education - and because of all they have to lose , they are strategic about which races they enter , ' professor @entity40 said			1
