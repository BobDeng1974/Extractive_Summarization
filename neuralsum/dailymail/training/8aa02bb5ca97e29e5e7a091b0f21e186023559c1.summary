the @entity20 natives are accused of starving their adopted daughter @entity21 to death so they could sell her organs			1

on tuesday , after a hearing by a four - judge panel , the chief judge announced in @entity50 ' you have been set free , ' @entity46 reports			0
if the couple are convicted of starving their daughter to death , they could potentially be sentenced to death - though @entity5 has had a de-facto moratorium on executions for the past ten years			1
at a hearing wednesday , family friends testified about having lunch with the @entity63 and their three adopted children days before @entity21 's death			1
they said the couple made sure that all of their children ate			0
their lawyers will now submit summaries of the evidence of the couple 's innocence to the judges			2

the @entity63 claim @entity21 was from medical problems complicated by anorexia - like bouts			1
the case has brought legal support and other aid from @entity86 groups , where the couple lived until 2012 , and has highlighted potential cultural misunderstandings in a @entity13 nation unfamiliar with adoption			1
@entity91 : the @entity63 moved to @entity5 in 2012 so @entity44 could work as an engineer on two major infrastructure projects associated with improvements for the @entity95 the prosecution alleges the couple denied food to their daughter @entity21 , who was born in @entity24 and adopted at the age of four			1
they also claim she was locked in her room at night			0
the couple say the girl had various medical problems and also erratic eating habits , including periods of binging and self - starvation			0
they say she was not allowed from her room at night because of bizarre behavior during eating sprees , including rummaging through garbage for food			0
she would also try to leave the house at night in search of food and pick through the medicine cabinet on late - night binges , according to a report prepared in the @entity4 by @entity122 , a pediatric forensic psychologist who reviewed the case for the family			0
the behavior is not uncommon in adopted children who have suffered from severe malnutrition in their past , the report says			2
@entity21 , who was slight for her age , also had been treated for an intestinal parasite , and recent blood tests had showed severely low levels of a certain type of white blood cell that could have been a sign of an underlying bone marrow condition , as well as a vitamin d deficiency			2
when @entity21 died , she was in an anorexic episode and had not eaten in as many as four days , @entity122 wrote in her report			1
a @entity5 doctor who conducted @entity21 's autopsy found that the child 's hips , ribs and spine protruded and concluded the cause of death was dehydration and wasting disease			2
supporters in the @entity4 say those diagnoses are n't possible and do n't take into account the child 's long history of eating disorders and malnourishment that caused lifelong health concerns , as well as recent blood work			0
officials in @entity5 also have raised questions about the adoption procedures , including payments to an adoption agency			2
this is likely because adoption is virtually unknown in traditional @entity13 @entity166 societies , where extended families would provide care			0
in addition , an investigative report by @entity5 police raised questions about why the @entity173 would adopt children who did not share their ' hereditary traits ' and raised concerns that the children were part of a human trafficking operation or were ' bought ' for organ harvesting , according to the family 's website			0
