by @entity1 reporter published : 11:48 est , 5 august 2013 updated : 12:00 est , 5 august 2013 startling documents reveal that the @entity3 permitted its informants to commit at least 5,658 crimes in just one year , or an average of over 15 incidents a day			1
these new records , obtained by @entity9 yesterday , provide a first public view of just how frequently the agency employs criminals to help with their inquiries			0
yet this figure is just the tip of the iceberg			0
the @entity3 's set of sources represents a small fraction of the huge amount of informers used by state and local government every year			1
no data is available on other federal authorities such as the @entity26			1
nerve center : the @entity28 in @entity29 is headquarters for the @entity3 , and its network of informants vital : @entity35 ' the ear ' @entity33 was the first official mafia boss to cooperate with federal authorities in 2004			1
the @entity38 boss agreed to wear a wire during conversations with his successor and implicated many of his former associates ' the million - dollar question is : how much crime is the government tolerating from its informants ? ' @entity48 , a professor at @entity50 @entity49 told @entity9			1
' i 'm sure that if we really knew that number , we would all be shocked , ' she added			0
this 2011 report , acquired by @entity9 under the @entity55 , has been heavily redacted by the authorities			1
as such , the document does n't explain the type or severity of the crimes committed by agency informers , or how many incidents involved the sources without permission of the @entity3			1
the @entity3 has been required to submit these details to the @entity66 for over a decade , after the agency allowed @entity69 ' @entity68 to run a crime ring in exchange for information			1
the agency has defended its actions in the past , saying that allowing its informers - who are often criminals - to commit offences is a necessary evil			0
law change : the @entity3 has been required to submit informer details to the @entity66 since the agency allowed @entity69 ' @entity68 ( pictured center as his trial in july 2013 ) to run a crime ring in exchange for information			1
' it sounds like a lot , but you have to keep it in context , ' said @entity90 , who worked on @entity3 criminal investigations until he retired in 2012			2
' this is not done in a vacuum			0
it 's not done randomly			0
it 's not taken lightly , ' he continued			0
an @entity3 spokeswoman declined to give more details			2
but @entity9 reported that the agency had around 15,000 confidential sources in 2007			2
there are strict rules , enforced by the @entity66 , on what @entity3 informers are allowed to do			2
violent crime for example can not be authorized by agents and must have federal approval first			2
yet a 2005 inspection concluded that the agency often broke these restrictions , as reported by @entity9			0
' this is all being operated clandestinely			0
@entity115 does n't even have the information , ' @entity114 congressman @entity113 told the paper			0
betrayal ? in 2013 , the @entity3 released documents that confirmed that noted photographer @entity120 served as a paid informant from 1958 to 1972			2
@entity122 reported on the activity of several @entity125 leaders , including @entity126 , @entity127 @entity113 has also sponsored legislation that would make federal authorities report serious crimes committed by their informers			1
' i think there 's a problem here , and we should have full disclosure to @entity115 , ' he added .			0
