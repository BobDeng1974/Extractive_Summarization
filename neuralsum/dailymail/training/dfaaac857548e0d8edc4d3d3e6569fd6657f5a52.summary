home - owners in one of @entity3 ’s busiest commuter towns were today celebrating the extension of the £ 14.8billion @entity6 scheme to include @entity7			1
from 2019 , the @entity10 fast - train service will also include the busy @entity12 commuter town – giving a fast track for workers in the @entity15 , the government announced			1
as well as benefiting commuters , the improved travel links are also likely to push up house prices in the @entity7 and @entity20 area			1
the £ 14bn @entity6 scheme will extend as far as @entity7 to the west of @entity23 , it has been announced today			1
pictured is the new extended route there had been intense speculation that the line could be extended further west from @entity30 - given a major refurbishment of reading station - although until today there had been no firm decision on this			2
@entity6 stretches from @entity12 in the west to as far east as @entity35 in @entity36 and also takes in spurs to @entity38 in west @entity23 and to @entity39 in south east @entity23			1
transport minister @entity40 said that , once @entity6 services began across the whole line in 2019 , passengers travelling to @entity23 from @entity7 and other @entity43 stations would be able to reach more destinations across @entity23 without the need to change at @entity48			1
once operational , @entity6 services are expected to serve @entity30 on a four - trains - per - hour basis as originally planned , with two of these services continuing to @entity7 via @entity20			1
in addition , the planned future @entity55 franchise service pattern from @entity7 to @entity23 will not change			2
twice hourly , semi-fast services and existing fast mainline services will continue , calling at the same stations as today			0
mr @entity40 said the @entity7 extension will also generate some cost savings from reduced infrastructure enhancements at @entity30 and @entity63 , and only minor works will be required at @entity20 and @entity7 to accommodate @entity6 services			1

it is thought the move will boost property prices in the @entity72 and @entity20 area reading town centre - which is now to be included in the @entity6 project			1
the route will now run from @entity7 through to @entity35 , @entity36 rail minister mr @entity40 said the extension of @entity6 to @entity7 was ‘ further proof of our commitment to deliver a transport network fit for the 21st century			1
’ he said : ‘ it will improve connectivity and deliver greater choice and convenience for passengers travelling into @entity23			0
it will also make better use of the already congested @entity55			0
’ he said this would free up capacity for potential direct services from @entity7 to @entity38 as part of the western access scheme			2
the minister said he had also asked @entity94 to look at the cost benefit analysis of ‘ increasing the number of faster trains between @entity7 and @entity48			0
’ @entity98 , managing director of @entity99 and @entity100 , said : ‘ extending @entity6 to @entity7 will provide passengers with more journey options and will create better connections and direct services between @entity7 , @entity20 and destinations across @entity23 without the need to interchange at @entity48			2
’ trains will be introduced to run @entity6 services as follows : ministers said @entity6 will boost @entity23 ’s rail capacity by 10per cent by connecting @entity7 and @entity38 in the west with @entity35 and @entity39 in the east			1
up to 24 trains an hour will run between @entity48 and @entity115 during peak times			0
a transport department spokesman said : ’ it is estimated that @entity6 will generate at least 75,000 business opportunities and support the equivalent of 55,000 full - time jobs around the @entity3			0
three out of 5 businesses currently winning work on the project are based outside @entity23			0
’ @entity23 mayor @entity125 said : ‘ i am thrilled that the people of @entity7 and @entity20 will be able to take advantage of @entity6 , putting them on the doorstep of @entity23 's main employment centres by directly linking them to the @entity15 and @entity131 in world - class style			2
’ shadow transport secretary @entity134 mp said : ‘ @entity136 in government safeguarded the potential @entity6 route from @entity30 to @entity7 , so we welcome the decision to extend @entity6 to @entity7			2
‘ this is good news for commuters struggling with a cost - of - living crisis and will make the most of @entity136 's investment in @entity7 station , which should help the @entity43 economy to grow faster			0
’ @entity147 mp @entity146 , although welcoming the extension , said : ‘ this can only be seen as stage one in the process of delivering @entity6 for @entity7			0
this first phase will not reap the full benefits that @entity6 can and should bring to benefit people and businesses in @entity7 and the wider region			0
‘ because there will be so many stops between here and @entity23 , journey times to @entity23 will be no faster than they are now			0
