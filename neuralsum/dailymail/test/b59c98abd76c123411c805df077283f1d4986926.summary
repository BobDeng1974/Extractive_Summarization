many californians are taking extreme measures to conserve water in the face of the state 's historic drought			1
water - conscious residents have turned to techniques that utilize so - called ' gray water ' to help them meet the unprecedented new water - use restrictions imposed by governor @entity11 last week			1
those techniques may appear weird to some - like the toilet that doubles as a sink and used washing machine water used to water fruit trees - but these @entity0 maintain it 's the inevitable future of water conservation			1
extreme water saver : @entity20 of @entity21 has installed a hybrid sink - toilet in response to the unprecedented new water - use restrictions imposed by governor @entity11 in the face of the state 's historic drought			1
clean water comes in through the faucet , is used to wash hands and then flows into the toilet tank to be used to flush @entity20 , who lives in parched @entity21 , recently took the step of converting her home 's toilet into a toilet - sink			1
for $ 100 , @entity20 purchased the sink positive , she told @entity35			0
it replaces the tradition lid to her toilet tank with a small hand sink			2
' we 're washing our hands and then reusing that water , ' @entity20 said			2
clean city water comes in through the faucet and then fills the tank instead of simply going to waste			0
on the next flush , the used hand sink water comes down into the bowl			0
' the average person uses the bathroom what at least five times a day so that 's five times a day , so that adds up , ' she said			0
and just next door to @entity20 , her neighbor @entity55 is using the left over water from his showers , laundry and other tasks to irrigate his yard			0
first , the ' gray water ' goes through a filtration system that @entity11 had installed as the drought - now in its fifth year - continued to worsen			1
@entity67 water : @entity20 's neighbor @entity55 collects all the soapy used water from this home 's washing machine 's , showers and sinks and uses it to irrigate trees and plants in his yard a / c condensation : @entity78 , in the affluent @entity80 neighborhood of @entity81 , @entity82 , the owner of @entity84 ! @entity85 , has installed one of his company 's 10,000 - gallon rainwater tanks under his home as well as a smaller tank to collect gray water			1
one place he gets water is from the condensate from his home a / c units ' every drop of water flows down to this pipe , runs underground now , down to the front yard , and then it 's spread , ' @entity11 explained to @entity35			0
to the south , a resident of @entity104 ' affluent @entity81 neighborhood is going to even bigger extremes to conserve precious moisture			0
@entity82 , the owner of hey ! @entity85 , tells @entity108 he 's installed one of his company 's 10,000 - gallon rainwater tanks under his home as well as a smaller tank to collect gray water			1
one of the sources of the gray water : the condensation from his admittedly large home 's air conditioning units			1
@entity82 uses his gray water to , among other things , feed his horses			1
' there are so many opportunities to harvest your water on your site , ' he says			0
while they may appear to verge on the fanatical now , these conservationists believe what they are doing is the new normal for the @entity130			0
according to the @entity133 , @entity132 ’s @entity131 was the third driest in 119 years and the warmest on record , so perpetual wildfire season also appears to be the new normal			2
@entity67 water systems like @entity138 filter a home 's soapy water in order to make it usable for plants and lawns and there ’s little relief on the horizon : the @entity149 ’s seasonal drought outlook predicts developing , persisting or intensifying drought conditions for most of the @entity152 through at least the end of june			1
the @entity155 snowpack is at 5 percent of normal , the lowest since record - keeping began in 1950			0
with the wet season over and with no major rainfall in the forecast , parched conditions will continue			0
the @entity162 snowpack is a key element of @entity132 's water supply			2
about one - third of the state 's water comes from snowpack that melts in the spring and summer , recharging groundwater and replenishing reservoirs			2
but with hardly any snow recorded during the last survey of the year , there will be little runoff to refill half - empty reservoirs			0
many @entity132 cities get their drinking water from the @entity178 basin , which supplies water to about 40 million people and 4 million acres of farmland in seven states			2
@entity11 's order called for investment in new water technologies and the streamlining of water projects such as desalination plants that turn ocean water into drinking water			2
such facilities , however , are expensive to build			0
unprecendented : calif. gov. @entity11 on wednesday ordered sweeping and unprecedented measures to save water in @entity132 no snow : surveyors on wednesday found the lowest snow level in the @entity155 snowpack in 65 years of record - keeping , marking a fourth consecutive year of vanishing snow that @entity132 depends on to melt into rivers and replenish reservoirs			1

@entity132 is experiencing one of its most extreme droughts in *modern* history , *forcing* *concerned* residents to react with extreme measures
conservation techniques include utilizing so - called ' gray water ' **--** soapy water used once for cleaning and by *appliances* **--** for a second use
those uses may include irrigation , flushing a toilet or even feeding *livestock*
