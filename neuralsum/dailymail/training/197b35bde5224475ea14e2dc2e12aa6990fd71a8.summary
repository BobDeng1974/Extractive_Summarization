former @entity1 president @entity0 is n't eyeing a return to the @entity3 just yet , but he is thinking about what people will call him if his wife @entity6 – the former first lady – becomes the 45th president			1
first gentleman ? @entity9 ? first man ? ' let 's say , if a woman became president , we could – i could be called ' @entity16			1
' i do n't know , ' mr. @entity0 told cooking show host @entity17 on thursday , according to snippets released before the episode aired			1
the idea of the legendary lothario as ' first gentleman ' usually brings eye - rolls from conservatives and lip - biting from liberals , but @entity6 is the odds - on favorite to win the @entity30 's nomination next year			1
given some of her husband 's extracurricular activities during his 8 - year presidency , having this particular ' gentleman ' in the @entity3 again – this time in the @entity36 – would become an endless source of entertainment for late - night tv hosts			1
@entity40 , rested and ready : @entity0 said thursday that it 's up to his wife @entity6 what to call him if she wins the 2016 presidential contest @entity0 joked with @entity17 that as ' first man ' his nickname might become ' @entity16 ' @entity46 : mrs. @entity6 has been first lady , a @entity1 senator and secretary of state – and now reportedly wants the ultimate brass ring when @entity6 ran in 2008 , mr. @entity0 told @entity50 that he would ' not get underfoot too much ' at the @entity3			1
' i do n't want to get in the way , ' he said then			2
' i want to do what i am asked to do and what i am needed to do			0
' he planned to have an @entity36 office and a staff , and also to keep his @entity59 office at the @entity61 's office			2
' it 's also not bad for @entity1 to have a former president out there helping people solve their problems , ' @entity0 added			1
' i think that i could do a lot of double time , like if she wanted me to go someplace to work with some problem , i could also be doing my foundation work			0
' in 2007 at the @entity74 , he suggested a twist on ' first lady , ' saying a @entity78 friend told him to embrace the title ' first laddie ' instead			1
' officially , the @entity81 would be introduced at public functions as ' the @entity83 and president @entity0 , ' according to @entity3 protocol guidelines			1
similarly , when @entity87 was presdient and his father would visit for formal events , press guidelines referred to them as ' the @entity83 and president @entity87			2
' if former @entity94 governor @entity93 were to become president and his father were still around , the @entity3 troika would be introduced at his inauguration as ' the @entity83 , president @entity87 and president @entity98			2
' but in the @entity81 ' orbit , @entity0 is already thinking past the first female president			1
' you know , if the president is a man , you call the president 's spouse ' the first lady , ' he told @entity107 , ' so we 'll have to cross this bridge if a gay couple [ is ever in the @entity3 ]			1
' ' we 're joking about this , ' @entity0 said , ' but it 's a serious decision			1
serious decision for @entity6 , serious decision for the country , and the world			0
' ' look , i love my wife			0
whatever she wants to do , i 'm for			0
i think it 'd be good for the country because she 's the ablest person i 've ever worked with			2
' ' if she decided not to do it , ' he said , imagining the politically unlikely , ' i 'd give her the bucket list , and we 'd go check ' em off			0
' that , at least , would remove the quirky question of what to call him			0
meet the first gentleman : @entity0 could return to the @entity3 with a lot less responsibility this time around power couple : the @entity81 could be the ultimate epicenter of @entity1 influence if @entity6 wins the @entity3 when 2008 @entity140 vice presidential nominee @entity139 was governor of @entity141 , her husband @entity142 preferred to go by the honorific ' first dude			1
' the title ' first lady ' does n't actually refer to the president 's wife , but to the designated ' hostess ' at the @entity3			1
' first lady ' is the title of the hostess of the @entity3 , not the president 's wife			2
@entity1 has elected unmarried presidents , whose other female relatives filled the role			0
@entity157 never married ; @entity158 was wed while in office			0
@entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163 were widowers when they were elected			0
the wives of @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168 during their presidencies			0
technically speaking , @entity1 's youngest first lady was @entity171 – from jan 3 , 2000 to jan 20 , 2000			0
during those 18 days , her father was still president while her mother had left the @entity3 to become a @entity1 senator			0
youngest first lady : @entity171 was technically first lady for 18 days in 2000 , while her father was president and her mother was getting used to being a @entity1 senator so it 's conceivable that if @entity0 chose to live outside the @entity3 during a @entity6 presidency , someone else – like @entity181 's husband @entity180 – could be the ' first gentleman			1
' he 's a hedge fund manager on @entity184 , though , so he probably would n't like the new zip code			2
former first lady @entity188 , in an interview with @entity187 last year , mused about how the press scrutinized her fashion sense and hairdos , saying the spouse of the first female president should n't be let off the hook			2
' maybe we should be that way about the first gentleman also , ' she said			0
' and really critique the way they look all the time			0
their choice of tie , or their hairstyle , or whatever			0
' ' or maybe their weight , ' she joked			0
@entity0 was on @entity107 's show thursday to hep her make a ' healthy game - day chili ' for @entity210 .			1

in a riff on ' first man , ' former president told cooking show host @entity17 that ' i could be called ' @entity16 . ' i do n't know '
he would likely still be referred to as ' mr. president , ' the same as today , but he said in 2007 that he liked a @entity78 friend 's idea : ' first laddie '
' president @entity0 ' would *suddenly* no *longer* be enough to distinguish the two spouses
' first gentleman ' has been the *traditional* choice in other countries
@entity139 's husband actually went by ' @entity142 ' when she was @entity141 's governor
