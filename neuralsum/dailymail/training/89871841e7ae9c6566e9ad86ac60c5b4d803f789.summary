by @entity0 published : 05:36 est , 20 september 2012 updated : 07:39 est , 20 september 2012 in a critical climate indicator showing an ever warming world , the amount of ice in the @entity3 has shrunk to an all time low			1
the shocking new figures reveal the ice has halved in size since the 1980s			1
' we are now in uncharted territory , ' said snow and ice data center director @entity12			1
' while we â€™ve long known that as the planet warms up , changes would be seen first and be most pronounced in the @entity3 , few of us were prepared for how rapidly the changes would actually occur			0
' the ice cap at the @entity29 measured 1.32 million square miles on sunday , according to the new data released today			1
scientists say this is 18 percent smaller than the previous record of 1.61 million square miles set in 2007 , according to the @entity35 in @entity36 , @entity37 records go back to 1979 based on satellite tracking			1
' on top of that , we 're smashing a record that smashed a record , ' said data center scientist @entity45			0
sea ice shrank in 2007 to levels 22 percent below the previous record of 2005			1
ice in the @entity3 melts in summer and grows in winter , and it started growing again on monday			1
in the 1980s , @entity45 said , summer sea ice would cover an area slightly smaller than the lower 48 states			1
now it is about half that			0
man - made global warming has melted more sea ice and made it thinner over the last couple decades with it getting much more extreme this year , surprisingly so , ' recently the loss of summer ice has accelerated and the six lowest september ice extents have all been in the past six years , ' @entity12 said			1
' i think that 's quite remarkable			0
' @entity12 said except for one strong storm that contributed to the ice loss , this summer melt was more from the steady effects of day - to - day global warming			1
scattered ice floes are seen from the bridge of the @entity72 on august 20 , 2012 northwest of @entity73 , @entity74			1
the @entity75 @entity35 shows the amount of summer sea ice in the @entity3 on tuesday , sept. 18 , 2012 , at center in white , and the 1979 to 2000 average extent for the day shown , with the orange line			1
but he and others say the polar regions are where the globe first sees the signs of climate change			0
' @entity3 sea ice is one of the most sensitive of nature 's thermometers , ' said @entity92 , an @entity94 polar researcher			2
what happens in the @entity3 changes climate all over the rest of the world , scientists have reported in studies			0
the ice in the @entity3 ' essentially acts like an air conditioner by keeping things cooler , ' @entity45 said			2
' and when sea ice melts more , it 's like the air conditioner is n't running efficiently , ' he said			2
sea ice reflects more than 90 percent of the sun 's heat off the @entity110 , but when it is replaced by the darker open ocean , more than half of the heat is absorbed into the water , @entity45 said			2
scientists at the snow and ice data center said their computer models show an @entity3 that would be essentially free of ice in the summer by 2050 , but they add that current trends show ice melting faster than the computers are predicting			2
' climate models have predicted a retreat of the @entity3 sea ice ; but the actual retreat has proven to be much more rapid than the predictions , ' said @entity128 , a climate scientist at @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 ' there continues to be considerable inter-annual variability in the sea ice cover , but the long - term retreat is quite apparent			2
' the thickness of the ice cover is also in decline			0
' the core of the ice cap is the perennial ice , which normally survived the summer because it was so thick ' , said @entity144 , senior scientist with @entity130			1
' but because it 's been thinning year after year , it has now become vulnerable to melt			0
' the disappearing older ice gets replaced in winter with thinner seasonal ice that usually melts completely in the summer			0
this year , a powerful cyclone formed off the coast of @entity74 and moved on aug. 5 to the center of the @entity3 , where it churned the weakened ice cover for several days			0
the storm cut off a large section of sea ice north of the @entity156 and pushed it south to warmer waters that made it melt entirely			0
it also broke vast extensions of ice into smaller pieces more likely to melt			0
' the storm definitely seems to have played a role in this year 's unusually large retreat of the ice " , @entity128 said			0
' but that exact same storm , had it occurred decades ago when the ice was thicker and more extensive , likely would n't have had as prominent an impact , because the ice was n't as vulnerable then as it is now			0

ice cap at the @entity29 measured just 1.32 million square miles on sunday
