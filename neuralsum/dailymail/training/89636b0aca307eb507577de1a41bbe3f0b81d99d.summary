a mysterious @entity1 blogger has provoked a storm of speculation online over claims he predicted the disappearance of an @entity7 flight thirteen days before one vanished			1
in a series of posts which have gone viral , the man appears to warn that the airline would be targeted by a shadowy group he calls the ' @entity13 ' which he claims brought down @entity15 flights @entity16 and @entity17 earlier this year			1
an @entity7 flight went missing yesterday with 162 people on board after losing contact en route from @entity23 in @entity24 to @entity25 in the third crisis for a @entity28 carrier this year			1

' given how powerful the black hand are i suggest that all @entity1 thinking about travelling to avoid @entity68 , so that you do n't disappear like those on @entity17			1
' @entity13 is a term believed to be a metaphor for a covert organisation or a number of underground groups			0
one @entity49 user suggests the translation should read ' international big black hand ' which they say is more of a reference to a ' despicable international bully '			1

' aviation mysteries like this often spark conspiracy theories as happened when @entity17 disappeared over the @entity179 in march last year , with explanations ranging from the airliner being shot down to being abducted by aliens			2

the @entity1 version of the @entity190 suggested the blogger called himself the ' landlord ' although some forum users claim this was a mistranslation			2
