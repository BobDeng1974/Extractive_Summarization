@entity0 resisted the temptation until someone mentioned defending			1
@entity3 had been talking about how it was easier to set up a team designed primarily to defend , just as @entity6 had ventured after @entity8 ’s victory at @entity9 , last year			1
‘ it ’s not easy , not easy , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ if it was easy , you would n’t lose 3 - 1 at home to @entity14			1
if he defends well he draws 0 - 0 against @entity14 and wins in @entity15			1
it ’s not easy to defend			0
’ @entity0 hit back at @entity3 during his pre-match press conference on friday @entity3 ( left ) and @entity0 have over a decade of history in the @entity19 @entity3 will be sick of the sight of @entity21			1
he has scored 13 times for @entity8 against @entity23 , averaging a goal every 87 minutes			1
@entity0 is not afraid to hit where it hurts			1
@entity23 have been brilliant since the turn of the year , but they were downright awful at home to @entity14			1
they conceded three and they crashed out of the @entity29			0
it was a blemish to support the theory that @entity23 are fine until the pressure is on			2
when @entity8 crashed out of @entity34 they were , as usual , snarling and disputing every decision			2
‘ maybe you will discover the @entity8 team are completely offensive and we are defensive for 90 minutes , ’ said @entity3 , resorting to sarcasm as he assessed the clash at the @entity38 on sunday			1
‘ our job is to win football games and that ’s what they ’ve done in recent games			0
what ’s important for me is to do what it takes to win the game			0
it ’s easy to defend , if we have to defend then we will defend			0
’ it is the issue at the heart of this ideological clash			0
on one side @entity3 , committed to the romance of attractive football			2
on the other @entity0 , doing what it takes to win even if it proves ugly , stacking up the trophies			2
beat @entity23 and @entity62 , on wednesday , and he will clinch the title			1
@entity23 lost 3 - 1 to @entity14 in the @entity29 - a result which @entity0 mentioned to the media @entity66 of @entity14 celebrates with the away fans after the full - time whistle at the @entity38 @entity3 looks dejected as he stands on the touchline during the @entity71 ' @entity29 defeat the challenge for @entity3 is next season			1
can he produce a team fit to fight for the title once again ? ‘ we have played amazingly well for most of the season , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ in the last period we have been more strategic and less artistic because we had injuries and suspensions and lost the balance of our team			0
‘ but we are having results			0
it is a great feeling to deal with the difficult moment in a strategic way			0
when you are lost at sea and you have no boat , you must survive			0
’ @entity90 ’s injuries and suspensions were @entity8 ’s shipwreck			2
without his muscular spearhead , the balance was lost and it is three months since his team won by more than one goal			0
still they win , taking six points from their last two games — against @entity101 and @entity102 — while recording a total of only three shots on target			0
they are , as @entity3 says , efficient			2
‘ we are top since day one , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ we are second in terms of goals scored			0
we are second best for goals conceded , the team with fewest defeats			0
@entity8 forward @entity114 ( second from left ) scores against @entity102 last time out hazard scored the only goal of the game against @entity102 to take @entity8 a step closer to the league title a tv camera gets a close - up of the goalscorer as @entity115 celebrates with @entity21 at @entity123 ‘ we have some of the best goals of the season , not individual action or shots like @entity128 ’s from midfield , but spectacular team goals			1
‘ so , if we win the @entity19 , we did everything right			0
it will be a great achievement			0
looking at where @entity8 were in the last four or five years , it means a lot			2
’ it will be the first title in five years at @entity123			0
@entity23 have not won it since 2004 , the year of @entity3 ’s invincibles and the year @entity0 first swept into @entity138 claiming to be the @entity139			1
since then , two famous clubs have been soaked in the contrasting views of two men			0
@entity23 are @entity3 , after more than 18 years of his leadership , and @entity8 have been @entity0 for more than a decade — even during his six - year absence			1
@entity0 ( right ) and @entity3 have had plenty of touchline battles during their managerial careers the pair rarely miss the chance to damn with faint praise or hurl a snide remark across the capital @entity23 's @entity154 is restrained by @entity8 boss @entity0 during the 2007 @entity156 final they rarely miss the chance to damn with faint praise or hurl a snide remark across the capital			1
for many years , @entity3 pursued @entity8 for ‘ financial doping ’ and , more recently , their tactical style , while @entity0 gorged on @entity23 ’s nine years with neither a trophy nor a managerial change			1
@entity0 has never lost to @entity3 , a record which clearly eats away at the @entity165 , who exploded on the touchline at @entity123 , in october , and shoved the @entity8 manager in the chest			1
there has been no apology			0
‘ no , but i do n’t need that , ’ shrugged @entity0 , who remains incredulous that @entity3 was not disciplined by the @entity172			1
does he feel it would have been different had the roles been reversed ? ‘ i do n’t feel , i know , ’ he said .			0

@entity8 can secure the league title if they beat @entity23 and @entity62
@entity0 and @entity3 have had a decade of touchline battles
@entity0 has hit back at @entity3 's ' defensive ' jibes ahead of sunday
he said : ' if it was easy , you would *n't* lose 3 - 1 at home to @entity14 '
