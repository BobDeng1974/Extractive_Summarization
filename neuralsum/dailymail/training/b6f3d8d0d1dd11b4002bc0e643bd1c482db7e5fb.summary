by @entity0 for @entity1 faced with a inquisitive lion pawing at the car window , most motorists would hit the accelerator and drive on			2
but this team of filmmakers were n't going anywhere until they got their killer shot at a nature reserve in @entity11			2
as the lion presses its huge paws against the window , one man asks calmly : ' are we rolling ? ' they then thrust three cameras into the lion 's face as they laugh behind the flimsy safety of the car window			0
say cheese ! the passengers whip out their cameras and start filming as the lion approaches the car the four passengers laugh and joke with each other and tell the lion : ' keep it outside buddy '			0
one of the men then nervously questions whether the lion could break the window if he leans on it			0
the lion continues to claw at the window before snapping the wing mirror clean off			1
taking that as their signal to leave , the crew speed off with the lion in hot pursuit			1
but bizarrely they roll the window down in a bid to get a crystal clear shot of the predator			0
risky business : the filmmakers keep their cameras rolling even though the lion is clawing at their window i 'm ready for my close up : the lion appears to be determined to get into the car - or perhaps he 's just enjoying his moment in front of the camera ? the film crew was visiting the wildlife sanctuary owned by ' @entity64 ' @entity63			1
the 1300 hectare @entity67 private @entity65 is an hour 's drive from @entity69 and focuses on the conservation of lions and other large predators			0
a bit too close for comfort : the lion then takes a bite out of the car 's wing mirror step on it driver ! the angry lion chases the group 's car across the game reserve			1

crew continue to film while lion claws at their car windows in @entity11
when the lion snaps wing mirror clean off they take it as their signal to leave
they speed off with the lion in hot pursuit and all the windows rolled down
