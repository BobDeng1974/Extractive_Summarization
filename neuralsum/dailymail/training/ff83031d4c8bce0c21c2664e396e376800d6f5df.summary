@entity1 's front cover usually features the personality quizzes , sex tips and the latest @entity5 starlet , but the magazine has now gone for a completely different tactic			1

the plastic - wrapped issue features a blurry black and white picture of a girl with dark hair , with her hands raised as though she is trying to break the wrapping and the magazine encourages readers to rip open the plastic and free her			1
the picture represents the story of @entity28 , whose parents suffocated her with a plastic bag in front of her siblings in september 2003 , for supposedly bringing shame on her family after she refused to agree to an arranged marriage			1

' share to end the suffering of # honourkillings @entity81 ' the magazine 's mocked up cover image was presented to @entity62 parliament on wednesday during a lobbying event hosted by @entity86 and @entity53			1
