by @entity0 published : 04:03 est , 4 may 2013 updated : 04:05 est , 4 may 2013 a @entity2 tourist faced paying one of @entity2 's biggest - ever phone bills after thieves stole his mobile and used a sophisticated scam to rack up £ 15,000 in just two hours			1
@entity8 was pick - pocketed in a @entity10 resort and criminals used his number to repeatedly call a premium rate number charging up to £ 21 per minute			1
trading standards believe the phone number the criminals dialled was connected to their bank account , which was then pumped full of cash			1
frightening : @entity8 , 34 , from east @entity19 , ended up with a mobile phone bill of almost £ 15 000 , after his phone was stolen whilst on holiday in @entity10 mr @entity8 says his @entity23 was protected by a code , suggesting that the criminals used software to hack his number and use it to make thousands of pounds when it was taken on april 23			1
experts in @entity2 have told @entity30 it appears to be one of the rarest and most lucrative scams they have ever seen			0
jaw - dropping : mr @entity8 's monthly bill rose from £ 100 to £ 14,780 , which shows the long list of calls to a premium number every 20 seconds for ten days after his trip to @entity38 , mr @entity8 , who is an advertising executive from @entity19 , was told his april bill of £ 14,780.13 would have to come from his own pocket			1
it would usually have been have been around £ 100			0
@entity43 has now agreed to wipe the debt , and the father - of - one wants his terrifying experience to be a warning to others			2
' i 've been losing sleep over it			0
i 've just moved and we have a young child			0
i can not afford £ 15,000			0
' what i did n't appreciate until now was that sim card fraud is as profitable for thieves as credit card fraud			0
' people do n't realise that having their phone stolen is potentially far worse than having their wallet stolen , because there is so little protection in place			2
' we carry our phones round and do n't really consider that they offer thieves a direct route to our bank accounts			0
' there must be plenty of people who think that remote locking their phone when it 's lost or stolen will give them some protection			2
but it 's a more or less useless security measure , when the sim can be removed and plugged into the kind of sophisticated kit that will run up a bill for thousands of pounds in a matter of minutes			2
' i am extremely grateful for 02 's understanding and sympathy , and urge other phone users not to hesitate to cancel their sim if there is even the slightest chance that their handset has been stolen , the consequences of unauthorised calls can be far more severe than the inconvenience caused by replacing the @entity87 later on			2
' relieved : @entity8 , 34 , and wife @entity89 , 33 , who have recently moved and have a young son , but faced paying a bill they could n't afford until 02 stepped in trading standards say that anyone in this situation should report the phone lost or stolen to the police and their mobile phone company			1
a spokesman for the @entity99 said : ' a victim would have to ensure that they reported the phone as stolen , and the phone company were notified as soon as possible then the rights of the victim would remain the same as any other fraud – such as card cloning fraud , where by the bank would then reimburse the victim			0
' this money was obtained by deception and fraud and therefore the victim should not be liable for those extra charges ' our @entity116 has not heard of this particular scam before '			0
his provider 02 believes the bill is ' unprecedented ' , and stepped in today to wipe his giant debt			1
a spokesman said : ' we noticed an unusual high level of calls on mr @entity8 ’s mobile account and our @entity127 and security team investigated this			1
' as soon as they ’d identified fraudulent activity was happening , the phone was barred			0
we ’ve spoken to mr @entity8 today and let him know the charges have been cleared from his account			1

@entity8 's number was used to dial a premium rate telephone number charging up to £ 21 a minute
for a *fortnight* the father of one was told he had to pay the huge bill
trading standards say scam is new and people must report phones stolen
02 agree to wipe his debt that cost mr @entity8 and his family sleep
