by @entity0 published : 06:15 est , 12 april 2013 updated : 06:31 est , 12 april 2013 three women from the same family are to undergo drastic surgery after they were all diagnosed with a mutated gene that puts them at an exceptionally high risk of developing cancer			1
@entity11 , her daughter @entity8 and her sister @entity10 will all have their breasts , ovaries and fallopian tubes removed in a pre-emptive strike against the disease			1
doctors discovered the faulty @entity18 in mrs @entity11 , 53 , from @entity19 , @entity20 , after she was diagnosed with breast cancer two years ago			1
@entity11 , her daughter @entity8 and her sister @entity10 ( l - r ) all have a mutated gene that puts them at an exceptionally high risk of developing cancer			1
but their relative @entity27 ( far right ) , has tested negative after she tested positive , mrs @entity11 discovered there was a 50 per cent chance her daughter and sisters could also have the gene			1
testing revealed that her daughter @entity35 , 36 , and her sister @entity36 , 44 , and both possessed the mutation – giving them up to an 85 per cent chance of developing the disease			1
while having the gene tests , ms @entity10 was given the devastating news that she also had the early stages of cervical cancer			2
thankfully , mrs @entity11 's other sister , 49 - year - old @entity45 , tested negative			1
studies have shown that undergoing a mastectomy can reduce the risk of developing breast cancer by up to 90 per cent			1
removing the ovaries reduces the risk of ovarian cancer by 85 per cent			2
ms @entity8 has already had her ovaries and tubes removed and said that despite the trauma of the operation - and the fact it brought on the menopause - the decision had been a ‘ no brainer ’			2
the mother - of - one said : ‘ it was a choice between an 85 per cent risk or the surgery			2
' it was something i decided i needed to do for myself and for my son			0
coincidence or genetic ? both mrs @entity11 's grandmother ( left ) and mother ( right ) suffered with breast cancer functioning @entity73 and @entity18 genes are very important in preventing tumour growth			1
a faulty @entity76 gene is very rare , affecting less than one in 500 people			0
it puts women at a higher risk of developing breast , ovarian and fallopian cancer			2
men with with a faulty @entity18 gene are also at a higher risk of breast cancer			1
most women 's lifetime chance of developing breast cancer is 10 per cent , but this goes up to 85 per cent if you possess a mutated @entity18 gene			1
not all people who possess a faulty @entity18 gene will go on to develop cancer			1
surgery is not always necessary if a person tests positive			0
surveillance and drugs taken as a preventative measure are options			0
‘ the test has also identified my aunt 's cervical cancer - she would n't have known if she had n't been tested , so it has ultimately saved her life			0
’ ms @entity10 , who was diagnosed with cervical cancer three weeks ago , said she was ‘ quite confident ’ about her prognosis and that she had ‘ no doubt ’ that without the tests , the cancer would not have been discovered			2
the 44 - year - old said testing positive for the gene had come as no surprise to her as there was ‘ too much cancer in our family ’			0
mrs @entity11 asked to be genetically tested as both her mother and grandmother had suffered from breast cancer and her brother had died from stomach cancer aged 52			1
she said her grandmother , @entity125 , had a mastectomy and lived for 20 years after she was diagnosed with breast cancer aged 70			1
her mother , @entity128 , did not have a mastectomy , and died in 1992 from breast cancer , aged 60			1
despite this , she says she had to demand the genetic test from doctors			0
she was told she did not have enough family history to be tested on the @entity135 and would have to pay £ 600			0
she said : ‘ i dread to think what would have happened if i had walked away			0
’ she has since found out her 15 - year - old grandson has a 50 per cent chance of having the gene and will be tested when he is 18			2
former pop star @entity140 had a double mastectomy after being diagnosed with the faulty @entity18 gene despite her risk of cancer , mrs @entity11 has been waiting for 10 months to have the operation at @entity146			1
she said she is not seen as priority because it is a ' preventative ' operation			0
she now wants to make other people aware of the gene and urge them to get tested as it could save their lives			0
she does not believe there is enough information and support available			0
she added : ‘ i would urge people that if they think there is a link , to get tested			0
' former pop star @entity140 had a double mastectomy last year , aged 33 , after she discovered she carried the faulty @entity160 gene			0
the @entity162 star has raised the profile of genetically - linked cancer and filmed a documentary about her story			0
@entity167 , head information nurse at @entity168 , said : ‘ women with a strong family history of breast cancer can speak to their gp , who can refer them to a specialist breast clinic for a genetic test			2
‘ if you 're worried about your risk or have any questions about cancer , you can call @entity168 's nurses on freephone 0808 800 4040			0

@entity10 , @entity8 and @entity11 all have the faulty @entity18 gene
mutation increases chances of developing cancer by up to 85 per cent
the sisters ' mother and grandmother both had breast cancer
faulty gene was found after mrs @entity11 , 53 , developed breast cancer in 2011
