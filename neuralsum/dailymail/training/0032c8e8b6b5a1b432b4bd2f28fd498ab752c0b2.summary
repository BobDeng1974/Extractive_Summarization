by @entity0 published : 20:24 est , 18 june 2013 updated : 19:12 est , 25 june 2013 firing a giant ash cloud up into the sky and seemingly dispersing surrounding clouds with its powerful force , a dramatic time lapse video shows the moment a giant @entity8 volcano explodes into life			1
@entity8 's second highest peak @entity10 erupted on monday and it blew its top to relieve some of the building pressure within			1
the 30 second clip shows how ash poured from the 17,802ft volcano , which is less than 25 miles from the country 's capital @entity19 and its 8.8million residents , over a 12 minute period			1
as if it has blown a hole in the sky , the clouds surrounding the top of the volcano appear to be sent sprawling by the shockwave			0
the blast is the latest in a series of incidents of activity at the volcano since scientists first noticed a rise in seismic activity around @entity10 last year			2
just last month those living in the shadow of the giant volcano , known as @entity10 among locals , were put on high alert after scientists detected a dramatic increase in seismic activity			2
aftermath : the time lapse video only lasts 30 seconds but shows the effects of the blast for a full 12 minutes huge blast : the shockwave and falling debris can be seen tumbling down the slope of @entity10 as the ash cloud gets even bigger active : smoke continues to billow from the volcano which suffered its last major eruption back in 1947 danger : scientists first notice an increase in seismic activity around the volcano last year it was heard to rumble and seen to spew ash , lava and steam over a period of several days and officials imposed an exclusion zone around its base			1
the threat level was raised to @entity101 3 - the fifth rung on a seven - stage warning scale			0
@entity10 is an @entity105 word meaning ' @entity106 '			0
@entity10 lay dormant for decades until it began putting out small eruptions of ash almost daily in 1994			0
sleeping giant : it is not the first time it has been feared that @entity10 would erupt - last month disaster planners prepared residents living close to the giant for evacuation after it billowed a cloud of ash and was heard to rumble @entity119 : @entity10 has erupted more than 15 times since the @entity121 arrived in the country in 1519 @entity124 outbursts from @entity10 in recent years have seen officials forced to evacuate residents from their homes			2
the millions of people who have settled in and around the @entity8 capital mean experts regard @entity10 as one of the most potentially destructive volcanoes in the world			1
it has erupted more than 15 times since the @entity121 arrived in @entity8 in 1519 and saw its last major eruption in 1947			0
the volcano was first scaled by @entity137 in 1519 and the 16th century monastries built on its slope are a world heritage site .			0

the explosion was *filmed* at the peak of @entity10 in central @entity8
the 17,802ft peak spewed a giant ash cloud into the sky following the blast
experts say it could be one of the world 's most dangerous volcanoes
' @entity10 ' lies just 40km away from @entity19 and its 8.8million residents
