the scenario is familiar to millions of people who idly surf the internet and toy with potential purchases on @entity5			2
but what many of the retail giant ’s customers , including celebrities and politicians , do not realise is that their private tastes and interests can be easily accessed with the click of a mouse			1
items on their ‘ @entity16 ’ – those products they might want to buy in the future or hope to receive as gifts – can be seen simply by inserting a name or email address into a search box			2
the only way users can keep choices private is by clicking on a barely noticeable ‘ manage your lists ’ button			1
when @entity31 tested the system , we uncovered lists matched to several celebrities , including @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity38 star @entity37			1
a search for miss @entity36 revealed that she added two @entity41 text books to her @entity16 in june 2006 – a strange choice since she was studying for a degree in @entity44 at @entity45 at the time			1
her mother @entity47 also has a list , and it reveals her green - fingered habits as it includes the book @entity51 , described as a guide to ‘ creating the perfect vegetable garden with the minimum of fuss and effort ’			2

however , perhaps with the recent @entity72 ceremony in mind , there are also bottles of organic lavender soap			2

she lists a trampoline – and ‘ body sculpture ’ underwear			1
miss @entity37 had a chrome bell and kitsch wicker basket for her bicycle on her @entity101			2
the list was deleted after we pointed out the privacy breach to her representatives			2
while @entity108 and conservative members of the @entity110 all hid their choices behind privacy settings , some @entity107 frontbenchers appeared to be more relaxed about their browsing			1
the list of @entity115 , the 38 - year - old cat - loving @entity116 feminist who was recently appointed to @entity118 ’s @entity110 , includes the book @entity120 : women and @entity122			2
@entity123 , mr @entity118 ’s policy chief , appears to be keen on @entity124 , a 2006 film drama about skinheads			1
if you insert the name @entity129 , just one item comes up – the @entity130 , by @entity131 , who went to the same school in @entity134 as the @entity135			0
however , it seems that the @entity5 system is easy to manipulate			0
there is a wish list purporting to contain the perfect gifts for @entity141 , @entity107 ’s shadow business secretary – a £ 39 pot of @entity145 ’s yard face cream , a book on @entity147 by @entity148 , and a pair of swanky @entity151 moleskin trousers ( 34in waist )			0

the trampoline and body - shaping undergarment were deleted after the tv presenter was approached by @entity31			0
a source at the @entity170 said it would be willing to look into the privacy issue			0
@entity5 said : ‘ you can set up your list so that it ’s visible only to yourself , to people with a direct link , or to anyone			0
’ the spokesman then described a link buried in its website which explains how to make lists private			1
@entity5 has been accused of breaching customers ’ privacy by making it unclear how shoppers can make their wish lists private			1
the world ’s largest online retailer automatically sets customers ’ wish lists as being available to public view – which critics say leaves them open to snooping or abuse			1
internet privacy expert @entity196 said it should be the other way around			0
‘ @entity5 has an obligation to look after people ’s interests and these settings should be private unless someone wants to make them public , ’ he said			1
‘ it is simply unacceptable that millions of people are unaware that their shopping habits and interests are on show to the world			0
it is up to @entity5 to be much clearer and honest			0
