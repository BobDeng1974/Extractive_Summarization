@entity1 , from the @entity0 , had the pioneering operation two weeks ago it sounds like a scene from a horror movie			1
as almost every drop of blood was drained from @entity1 ’s body , for 20 minutes she ‘ died ’ on the operating table at @entity10			1
yet surgeons were saving her life			2
@entity1 was undergoing a pulmonary endarterectomy , a pioneering operation which put her into a corpse - like state as a heart - lung machine took over the work of these vital organs and her blood was removed			1
although her brain continued to function normally , with no oxygenated blood being circulated in her body , surgeons had just 20 minutes to remove clots from her lungs that were severely affecting her ability to breathe , before her organs would begin to shut down			1
thankfully , the procedure was a success , and less than a week later the 40 - year - old housewife was on her way home			2
while the seven - hour operation might seem like the stuff of nightmares , @entity1 admits she had few nerves as she became one of the 160 patients who undergo the surgery each year at @entity10			1
the hospital in @entity40 is one of only four centres in the world , and the only one in the @entity45 , able to carry out the highly complex procedure			1
her operation features in an episode of the @entity50 documentary series @entity51 i ’m a doctor later this month			2
@entity1 , of @entity53 , @entity0 , had her surgery just two weeks ago			1
she first began having problems in june last year when she had trouble breathing while walking her dogs			2
‘ i ’m asthmatic so i initially put it down to that and thought my inhaler was n’t working properly , ’ she says			0
‘ but within months i found i could n’t walk across the living room without being breathless , and then i began to get chest and shoulder pains as well			0
’ an x-ray revealed that @entity1 had blood clots in her lungs			1
she was suffering from chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension ( @entity68 ) – blockages in the blood vessels to the lungs as a result of scar tissue			2
the body naturally dissolves blood clots but in rare cases they become fibrous , block the arteries and prevent normal blood flow			1
@entity1 was referred to @entity10 and consultant cardiothoracic surgeon @entity80 had to determine if she would benefit from the operation			1
when they decided she was a suitable candidate , @entity1 was undaunted			2
‘ my quality of life had gone			2
i ’d got to the stage where i thought , “ what is the point ? ” i was existing , not living , so i jumped at the chance of surgery , ’ she says			2
surgeons perform a pulmonary endarterectomy at @entity10 - which involves putting the patient into a corpse - like state as a heart - lung machine takes over the work of these vital organs first , the patient is connected to a heart - lung bypass machine that diverts the circulation			1
the same machine is used to cool the body from @entity104 to @entity105 to prevent damage to vital organs			0
this also reduces the blood circulation so that for about 20 minutes there is no blood in the body at all			1
the heart stops beating , meaning the body is effectively lifeless			0
five litres of blood a minute are usually pumped into the pulmonary arteries , which is why it is vital that there is no blood to obstruct the surgeons ’ view as they open the blood vessels and then remove the artery lining to clear the clots			1
once this has been done , the patient is warmed up to a normal body temperature and taken off the bypass machine , a process that can take two hours			0
the hospital in @entity40 is one of only four centres in the world , and the only one in the @entity45 , able to carry out the highly complex procedure mr @entity80 says : ‘ to anyone watching the operation , the patient has flatlined , nothing is working , there is no blood going to the brain			1
they are put into a suspended state called deep hypothermic circulatory arrest			0
‘ we did a complex trial at @entity10 and discovered that after this operation , patients ’ cognitive skills were not impaired – in fact in many cases they improved			1
’ the condition affects both men and women , and mr @entity80 has operated on sufferers aged between 14 and 89			0
patients usually spend at least two days in intensive care but generally return home after two weeks			0
they must take blood - thinning drugs for the rest of their life to prevent further clots			1
‘ i feel as if i ’ve been given a new lease of life , ’ @entity1 says			2
‘ within days of the operation i could breathe properly and without pain			0
i ’m having a bit of physiotherapy to help with the healing where the surgeons made an incision in my sternum , but apart from that i feel amazing			0
@entity177 3 @entity178 ‘ i think in some ways it has been tougher for my husband @entity181 because he ’s had to put a brave face on things to support me , but now we feel we have a future to look forward to			0
’ ltrust me i ’m a doctor will be screened on @entity188 on october 29			0
ask a stupid question do some people never cry ? dr @entity191 , lecturer in the neurobiology of personality at @entity194 , @entity195 , says : ‘ our emotional reactions are influenced by two structures near the base of our brain known as the amygdala			0
' damage to this area causes impaired emotional reactions			0
however , there is naturally variance in amygdalar reactivity between individuals			0
people at the low end of the scale would have relatively flat , unemotional personality profiles			0

@entity1 , from the @entity0 , had blood clots in her lungs
condition was causing major breathing difficulties , *diminishing* quality of life
she was offered operation at @entity10 , @entity40
it is one of only four centres in the world able to do the pioneering surgery
involves putting patient into corpse - like state where blood is drained
gives surgeons just 20 minutes to remove clots before organs shut down
