@entity1 , a young bay mare , was bought by @entity3 broker @entity2 in 1911 as a present for his son , @entity5 , on his 15th birthday			1
for the next three years , the teenager spent his days hunting with his beloved horse in the countryside near the family farm in @entity11			2
but in 1914 war was declared and @entity2 , who had recently resigned his position as lieutenant colonel in the @entity15 , enlisted - joining the @entity16 of the @entity17			0
and that december , just two days after finishing school , @entity5 was on active service as second lieutenant			0
father and son began preparing the family 's horses , @entity1 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 , for battle - readying defences on the @entity30 coast in case of a @entity33 invasion			1
birthday present : @entity1 , pictured with a stable hand , was bought for @entity36 as a gift from his father in 1911			1
just three years later , the horse was trained for battle and joined @entity42 forces on the @entity11 coast it marked the start of a remarkable journey that lasted more than four years and saw the @entity47 and their horses travelling thousands of miles to serve on the front line			1
together , the men and their horses faced the horrors of conflict together			0
they trudged through the muddy fields of @entity55 ; dragged guns across the @entity57 in the sweltering heat ; and survived gunfire on the @entity61 battlefields			1
now , through a moving collection of letters sent back and forth from her owner , as well as touching photographs and candid diary entries , @entity1 's incredible story has been told for the first time			1
in his new book , @entity71 , @entity72 , a retired farmer from @entity11 , charts how his grandfather , @entity75 , and great - grandfather , @entity77 , travelled from @entity78 to @entity79 with their horses			1
the book offers touching insight into the bond between man and beast and sheds light on the lives of millions of courageous animals who fought alongside soldiers in the war			0
mr @entity2 said : ' @entity1 was one of millions of horses from both sides that went to war			1
loyal : two of the @entity96 ' horses , @entity1 and @entity26 , pictured during their service in the @entity98			1
their journey is told in a new book that draws on letters , photographs and diary entries from the front line posted : horses are loaded on to a train in @entity30 , before they are sent to the front line overseas			1
the @entity47 trudged through the fields of @entity55 , pulled guns through the @entity57 and dodged bullets in @entity112 service : a @entity42 battleship on the @entity115 , where the @entity96 ' and their horses were posted in 1916			1
the battery , stationed near the @entity118 for months , were ready to fight of a potential @entity120 onslaught and added that ' it is reasonable to suggest that the war could not have been fought ' without the horses ' ' courage , loyalty and hard work '			0
shortly after war was declared , lt col @entity127 bought 131 horses to add to the number of family animals			1
they were dispatched to the @entity11 coast and , after further training , the group sailed from @entity136 to @entity55 in november 1915			1
the horses and the soldiers who met in @entity30 would became ' old friends ' , mr @entity2 writes			0
the men looked after the horses , trained with them , and nursed them through the horrors of war			2
the @entity96 ' journey echoes the plot of @entity147 , the @entity148 novel that has been adapted into an award - winning play and film in which a teenager from @entity153 and his horse , @entity155 , are both put to use on the @entity157			1
brutal : living under the intense heat of the @entity160 sun took its toll on both humans and horses in @entity1 's battery , pictured together in april 1916 - three months after they arrived in the country vital : camels were among a number of animals that were vital in helping the @entity42 troops survive in @entity160 action : @entity1 's battery saw their first real action of the war when they were stationed in @entity61 in 1917			1
above , what remains of a tank that was destroyed during a conflict in the @entity179 desert but while @entity155 sees the worst of the action in @entity55 , the @entity47 and their horses escaped the worst of it and were posted to @entity160 in january 1916			1
conditions on the journey across were terrible , and @entity187 was one of several horses to collapse on the second day at sea from lack of water and food			2
he could not be cajoled to his feet again , and had to be shot			0
the battery spent months stationed near the @entity118 - ready to fight of an expected @entity120 assault on the @entity115			0
there , the young men , who had arrived from a freezing @entity30 winter , battled to stay healthy in the intense @entity160 heat			0
but they were also concerned for the well - being of their horses			0
long way from home : flashlight , one of the @entity127 family horses , is watered at one of the desert camps ' old friends ' : by the time the war ended , those on the horse lines , like the ones pictured above , had become very attached to the animals			2
the @entity42 government declared that no horses were to return after the war an extract from the book reads : ' some of the horses ’ noses would also burn and the men would rub a lanolin lotion onto the burns … the men would try anything to keep their horses comfortable			0
' the horses were also plagued by flies and @entity1 was given a specially - designed fly fringe - another small act to keep him comfortable			1
from @entity160 , the battery were given orders to advance on @entity61 , where both the men and their horses saw their first major action of the war at the @entity234 , in march 1917			0
at the end of the campaign , only 22 of the 60 horses that @entity5 had brought from @entity11 had survived - and @entity1 was one of them			1
caring : @entity1 was given a specially - issued fly fringe to help keep her comfortable while serving in @entity160 when war was declared over on 11 november 1918 , the men were stationed in @entity79			2
@entity72 recreates the scene : ' ships ’ hooters boomed out , bells began to ring and the men began to shout and sing			2
' up on the hills fires were lit and all sense of army discipline seemed to vanish – news had arrived that an armistice had been signed with @entity33 … ' the sense of celebration was overwhelming			0
the men who were at the horse lines stopped their work , and many of the horses were just left to roam about			0
' the men embraced each other , they embraced the horses , they danced jigs and sang songs …			0
the celebrations were to last all night			0
' essential : horses drag @entity42 guns across the @entity57 - the only way the weapons could have been moved but while the surviving men were gradually being demobbed home , the fate of their brave and loyal horses was not decided for some months			1
the lt col wrote home : ' one feels marooned up here , no roads or railway to the base , a rotten little harbour which makes it almost impossible to ship horses and guns from here			2
' they will not i am sure ship any of these horses home , if they get them to @entity160 they ’ll turn them into hides and tallow , if we leave them here we will have to shoot the lot			0
' despite the difficulties , @entity75 ’s father continued to try and find a way of getting @entity302 home , but as time went by this seemed less and less likely			0
in february 1919 , the government decided that none of the horses from @entity160 would be brought back			0
@entity77 wrote to his son on 24th february 1919 : ' i have bad news to tell you , for i have had to destroy poor old @entity1 ; she had a frightful set to with a wandering mule at night , was horribly mauled , in fact i am not sure she had n’t a broken leg			2
' she did n’t suffer long ; we had 3 vets , & decided to shoot her			0
' the lt col instructed a veterinary sergeant to clean out @entity1 's shoe , which was sent back to @entity42 and mounted as a brass doorstop , and a ' permanent memory of the little horse ' , which mr @entity2 still uses today			2
@entity1 's @entity326 ( @entity327 , £ 12.99 ) is available to order now .			2

for more than four years they travelled thousands of miles on the front line
the horses trudged through @entity55 and dragged guns through @entity57
