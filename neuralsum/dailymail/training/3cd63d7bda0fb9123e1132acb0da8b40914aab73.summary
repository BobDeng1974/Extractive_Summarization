here goes : @entity2 grabs @entity9 for a dance on the @entity10 in @entity8 yesterday mr @entity2 will focus his campaigning efforts in @entity8 , which he has won twice as mayor in the face of a strong @entity26 challenge , and in northern marginal seats			1

mr @entity2 has yet to make up his mind about whether to return to @entity31 in 2015 , as mr @entity1 and chancellor @entity32 have urged – publicly at least			0
but his agreement to return to the national political scene , regardless of whether or not he runs for a seat in @entity36 , will electrify next year ’s election race			0
one step at a time : @entity2 copies @entity9 's moves during the photoshoot despite their rivalry , mr @entity2 ’s skills as a frontman are highly rated by both mr @entity1 and the @entity4 ’ @entity47 campaign chief @entity46 , who helped him win in @entity8			1
