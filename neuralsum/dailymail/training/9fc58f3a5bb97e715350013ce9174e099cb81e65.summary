it may well be the season of goodwill to all men			0
but that did not stop a mayor in south - west @entity5 installing metal cages over public benches to banish homeless people from the city			1
@entity10 , @entity11 's 34 - year - old right - wing mayor , has been criticised for his lack of empathy and @entity15 spirit			1
the mayor put up the cages on christmas eve in an effort to prevent ' drunk people ' snoozing on the benches			1
the decision was taken ' in concert with local traders ' who had complained to authorities that the drunken tramps ' threatening behaviour was bad for business , he added			0
regional daily newspaper @entity44 alleged the @entity46 square housing the benches had become the scene of fights between homeless people , often provoked by drugs and involving dogs			1
but the move sparked a wave of criticism , with people calling the measure ' abominable ' and ' sickening '			1
' what a shame , this is not @entity5 , ' declared @entity61 , a former @entity63 mp and @entity65 's political opponent			2
one commentator on @entity67 even suggested the mayor will go one step further next year and ' electrify ' the cages			2
@entity71 , the urban architect who designed the square , described the move as ' scandalous and inappropriate ' , telling @entity75 newspaper it was proof of ' political failure ' as it suggested the ' only safe places left are private ones '			2
the decision to insert the cages was taken ' in concert with local traders ' who had complained to authorities in the wake of growing criticism , the mayor ' temporarily ' removed the cages on @entity89 saying they will return soon filled with pebbles to reflect the square 's ' mineral aesthetics '			1
earlier this year , anti-homeless measures were also seen in south @entity95 , where 19 metal spike studs were inserted outside a luxury development in @entity98 near the entrance			2
the anti-tramp spikes were removed after images of them spread through social media , prompting the mayor of london @entity104 to intervene			0
he tweeted : ' spikes outside @entity98 housing development to deter rough sleeping are ugly , self defeating & stupid			0
developer should remove them asap			0
' we 've spent £ 34m on the likes of ' no 2nd night out , reaching 3/4s of rough sleepers , but must do more			0
spikes are simply not the answer			0
' a row of one - inch spikes were also removed from outside a @entity122 supermarket on @entity123 in central @entity95 after activists protested against them			0
the move was reminiscent of the metal spikes that were installed outside a luxury apartment in @entity98 away from the capital , @entity129 came under fire for building a cage around a set of hot air vents to prevent homeless people sleeping on its campus			1
the move prompted complaints from students - but university insisted the cages were a health and safety measure to stop the homeless breathing in harmful boiler fumes including carbon monoxide			1
only last week , a shop worker was reported to have hosed down a homeless man with cold water who was sleeping in the doorway of the @entity153 store in @entity154 , @entity155 .			0
