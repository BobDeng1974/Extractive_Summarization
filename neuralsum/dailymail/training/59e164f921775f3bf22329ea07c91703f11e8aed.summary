by @entity0 i have to confess i am not a fan of celebrity fragrances			1
i have never found one i liked since the launch of the most successful celebrity perfume of all time - @entity6 ( £ 53 for 100ml , @entity7 ) @entity6 created @entity8 in 1991			0
with top of notes of neroli , lily and tuberose ; middle notes of orris and amber and the base of sandalwood , patchouli and oak moss – it remains a glorious scent and is still a best seller – even after 23 years ! since then we have seen the launch of dozens of celebrity scents			0
mostly i find them too sweet , too cloying and with an annoying tendency to linger on your skin a tad longer than you want them to			0
chic : @entity34 recently launched her fragrance , @entity36 , which has a sweet scent with fruity notes understated : the bottle is pretty and cute - like @entity34 herself when the latest celebrity fragrance lands on my desk to try , it is unlikely that it will end up on my bathroom shelf , let alone on my wrists			1
so the news this week that our love affair with celebrity fragrances is cooling off , is strangely timed - especially as this week two new celebrity scents hit the shelves and another launches in the next few weeks			0
such is the excitement surrounding @entity34 's first ever fragrance , @entity36 , that @entity55 have brought forward the on sale date by a week			1
it will be stocked exclusively at all stores from today - friday 22nd august - until 8th september , before the fragrance is available nationwide			2
@entity55 is hugely optimistic , expecting to sell 30,000 bottles of @entity36 by @entity34 in the first month - almost 1,000 bottles a day			2
so what 's it like ? first impressions are promising			0
it is not what i expected			0
the @entity68 comes in a rose gold box , with a classy looking purple border			0
and unlike the @entity73 fragrance , which has the boys ' pictures plastered all over the box , this simply has the name of the perfume on the box , with the name cheryl in capital letters underneath			1
third scent : one direction launch their latest perfume , you & i , which comes in an @entity88 style bottle the effect is understated and chic , but i found the fragrance had a powerful kick			1
there are top notes of mandarin and nectarine , with the addition of vanilla , white musk and precious sandalwood			0
it is very sweet and certainly long lasting			0
i could still smell this 12 hours after first spraying it			0
the best thing about this perfume is the bottle			2
it is really pretty and cute - like @entity34 herself - with a beautiful rose gold lid in the shape of a golden flower			1
the bottle will appeal to all ages , but suspect what ’s inside it will appeal more to younger fans			0
@entity34 joins a long line of celebrities to have launched their own perfumes			2
superstar @entity119 has sold more than half a million bottles of fragrance at @entity55 since launching @entity122 in 2010 , and her latest fragrance , rise , has proven itself the best - selling celebrity fragrance of 2014 to date			1
other celebrity fragrance winners included @entity126 , whose gold @entity126 fragrance came second in sales only to his wife 's			2
@entity131 , whose fragrances have been consistent best sellers since the launch of @entity135 in 2004 , rounds off the top three with @entity137 & @entity138			0
@entity73 's @entity139 still a top five best seller a nearly a year after release			1
with the fragrance selling 1.5million bottles over last @entity146 period , the boys will be looking to repeat the success with their latest offering , you and i , which went on sale on wednesday			1
i reviewed @entity73 's first fragrance ' @entity139 ' when it launched			1
it was officially the fastest - selling celebrity perfume of all time following record - breaking sales in its first week of release in august 2013			0
at the time , i was n't very kind about it , but the legions of @entity73 fans obviously did n't agree and bottles flew off the shelves			1
top scent seller : could @entity34 knock @entity119 off her perch with her new fragrance ? you & i by @entity73 , £ 19.50 for 30ml @entity68 ( @entity55 ) is the third addition to @entity73 's popular perfume collection			1
it combines bright splashes of mango and refreshing grapefruit with a heart of creamy osmanthus , exotic orchid and soft peony			0
i found it quite similar to their first fragrance			0
if anything , this is a subtler , a little more grown up and certainly not as overpowering			0
when i sprayed it at first i found it far too sweet , but as it settled down a bit i actually found myself liking it			0
what a surprise ! it comes in a striking glass bottle , which somehow does not match the fragrance - it is elegant and sophisticated with an @entity88 style lid			2
this will definitely please all of @entity73 's fans who love everything they do			1
there is n't one of these bottles that i would n't be happy to display on my dressing table			0
the real secret of a successful celebrity scent is in the design of the bottle recent years @entity204 's scents have become collectors ' items - because of the exquisite bottles that look like works of art. the original @entity204 pink friday fragrance launched in april 2013 and was the third biggest selling women ’s fragrance , beating everything except @entity214 and @entity215			1
quirky : the new @entity204 onika fragrance , on sale in september fans will no doubt be flocking to buy the new @entity221 fragrance , £ 28.50 for @entity222 ( @entity223 ) when it hits the shelves on 17th september			1
this new bottle does n't disappoint and i think could be my favourite so far			1
the new fragrance is bold , with fruity notes of pear and mandarin with the floral scent of water lily and orchid with and a tiny touch of sweet sugar cane and musk			2
i have tried this one too - and was pleasantly surprised			1
not too heavy or sickly , as a light scent for early autumn days it fits the bill perfectly			0
but with the news this week that the celebrity scent market has lost its gloss , with sales down thirty percent of some names including @entity248 's fragrance , are the stores getting worried ? @entity250 , senior fragrance buyer at @entity55 says : ' celebrity fragrance really resonates with shoppers as it lets fans buy a little piece of their icon			1
while some celebrity fragrances may have lost their sparkle in recent months , the right star and the right fragrance will always succeed			0
' we 've long expected @entity34 to launch her own , and we 're predicting big things			2
with x factor in the pipeline and her latest single topping the charts , she 's truly on top of her game and fragrance is the next logical step			1
' i have heard that @entity272 is also rumoured to be bringing out a new scent … let 's hope she has the bottle to do it			2
read more from @entity0 on her @entity276			2

@entity34 's first ever fragrance , @entity279 , went on sale today
@entity0 is pleasantly surprised by the scent
bottle is pretty and cute
@entity73 's latest perfume is not as overpowering as previous offerings
bottle for @entity204 's latest fragrance does n't disappoint
