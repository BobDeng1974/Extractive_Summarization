by @entity0 published : 09:54 est , 12 september 2013 updated : 11:15 est , 12 september 2013 a grieving mother was devastated when she tried to collect her dead son ’s clothes from police , but was given a bag full of rubbish instead			1
@entity7 , 49 , thought she was going to collect the possessions of her son @entity9 , who died aged 18 in mysterious circumstances in 2007			1
@entity9 was staying at a friend ’s house when he was found slumped unconscious with a cut on his head , and was later pronounced dead			2
@entity7 , 49 , ( left ) was given a sack of old rubbish seized as evidence , instead of clothes that had belonged to her 18 - year - old son @entity9 ( right ) mrs @entity7 said receiving the bag of rubbish from police was ' heart - breaking ' and ' insulting ' mrs @entity7 was expecting to pick up the clothes her son was wearing when he died , but was instead confronted by a mess of dirty tissues , cigarette butts , grubby newspapers , food wrappers and empty cans and bottles			1
bungling members of @entity35 had given her a bag of rubbish from the house where he died , which was used as evidence			1
mrs @entity7 , who has fought for years to find out more about her son ’s death , described the blunder as ‘ heart - breaking ’			1
the black sack of rubbish was recovered from the house where @entity9 died , and was given to @entity47 by mistake she said : ‘ i ’m absolutely distraught			1
i had plucked up the courage to finally go and pick up my son ’s possessions and this is what they have given me to remember him by			0
‘ there is nothing here even remotely connected to my son for me to treasure			0
‘ i thought it was going to be his clothes and they would smell of him			0
it was a very personal thing for me - i wanted to be able to touch them and hold them again			0
the blunder was another blow to @entity47 , who has tried for years to find out more about how her son died ‘ but they literally gave me a bag of stinking rubbish			1
it ’s just heart - breaking			0
’ the police mistake came after mrs @entity7 , who also has four daughters had fought a six - year battle to get answers about how her son died unexpectedly in october 2007			1
@entity9 , a trainee scaffolder , was found dead the day after a party at a friend ’s house close to his family home in @entity84 , near @entity85			1
an inquest into his death heard how @entity9 ’s friend , @entity88 , woke up in the morning and noticed he was slumped unconscious on the floor with a cut on his head			2
but @entity88 and his mother did not call an ambulance until four hours after they noticed @entity9 ’s injuries , the inquest heard			2
in the meantime , the family had bagged up rubbish from the night before and even sat down to eat bacon sandwiches for lunch before eventually calling 999			0
eighteen - year - old @entity9 was a trainee scaffolder , and died after going to a party at a friend 's house @entity9 was pronounced dead as soon as he arrived at hospital			1
a coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death for @entity9 , which @entity7 has been fighting ever since			2
mrs @entity7 opened her own investigation into her son ’s death and even hired a private toxicology expert to disprove that @entity9 had been high on drugs			1
the @entity114 later ruled that @entity35 had made mistakes in their original inquiry , but the case has never been re-opened			2
the rubbish was collected as evidence from the house where @entity9 died in 2007 mrs @entity7 took her case to the @entity122 , but it was ruled that a fresh inquest could not be held because vital forensic evidence had been destroyed			1
once she had exhausted all her options to pursue answers , she asked to collect @entity9 ’s possessions which had been left with police			2
describing the moment she collected the bag , she said : ‘ the woman put it on the table and i felt the sealed bag			0
i expected it to be soft because i was expecting clothes			0
‘ but it felt hard so i said to her “ what is it ? ” she said “ i do n’t know ”			0
it had @entity9 ’s name and case number on a tag , though , so i took it			2
mrs @entity7 thought the bag contained @entity9 's clothes as it was labelled with his name and case number ' i did n’t want to open it there because i wanted privacy			1
i know he was wearing a blue hoodie , jeans and a black @entity154 tee shirt because i washed them all ready for him to go out that night			0
' ' to be given a bag of rubbish is just insulting			0
' superintendent @entity158 apologised for the mistake , and pledged to deliver the correct package to the distraught mother			0
he said : ' i express my sincere apologies for this situation '			0
' my staff fully understand how difficult this must be for families and all efforts are made to examine the contents fully before release but on this occasion , for understandable reasons , this was not possible			0
' having reviewed this case carefully , the police still have an item of clothing belonging to @entity9 and i will ensure this is delivered to @entity7 as soon as possible			1

@entity7 , 49 , wanted clothes that had belonged to her son @entity9 , 18
but instead she received a bag full of tissues , cigarette butts and beer cans
@entity9 died at a friend 's house in 2007 in mysterious circumstances
mrs @entity7 , from @entity84 , @entity191 , has looked for answers for years , but the case remains closed
@entity35 have apologised for the blunder
