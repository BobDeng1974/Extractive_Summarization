by @entity0 @entity1 has launched a set of his - and - hers bracelets crafted from recycled illegal gun metal and bullet casings			2
created in partnership with @entity8 - a philanthropic jewelry brand which aims to reduce gun violence in the @entity10 - each bracelet bears a serial number of an illegal gun it that @entity8 has recycled			1
' gun violence is rampant in the @entity10 , but it does n't have to be , ' reads @entity8 's mission statement			1
the ancient @entity30 twist design symbolizes unity , according to @entity32 , founder of @entity8 , but also the ' tension ' involved in addressing the difficult issue of gun control			1
the bracelets ' unique serial numbers , however , are perhaps their most poignant characteristic			0
' in the case of what we do , the serial number is the only thing that 's left of that gun , so it 's a thread back ' , mr @entity32 says on the collection 's promotion video			2
' it 's like a piece of dna , and it goes back to the source , but the physical thing where it came from does n't exist anymore			0
' his and hers : the ancient @entity30 twist design symbolizes both the unity required to bring about change , but also the tension involved in addressing the controversial topic of @entity10 gun laws detail : each bracelet comes with the original serial number from the gun used to make it , its last remaining element , which appears on the steel end caps according to @entity70 research , the @entity10 has an estimated 283million guns in civilian hands , and more than 30,000 people are killed by firearms each year - a third of whom are under the age of 20			1
of those deaths , over 10,000 are listed as homicides			0
in @entity81 , that figure is around 200 ; in most parts of @entity83 , it 's 150 and in @entity84 , its less than 50 per year			0
' @entity85 is rampant in the @entity10 , but it does n't have to be ' ' we focus very specifically on partnering with the police department , who give us illegal guns and bullets ' , says mr @entity32 , adding that the bracelets are made exclusively in the @entity10 this range is an extension of @entity8 's wider collection of rings , bracelets and necklaces			1
the brand has also collaborated with jewelry designers @entity99 and @entity101 , on pieces priced between $ 175 and $ 1,545			0
roots : @entity8 's mission was born a few years ago in @entity105 , where founder @entity32 ( pictured ) was disturbed by the number of young kids who were armed with assault rifles hoards : mr @entity32 collected up over 30,000 banned @entity114 's ( pictured ) around @entity105 and melted them down to make jewelery , the profits of which still go towards his aim of reducing gun violence @entity8 's story began 6 years ago on a trip to @entity105 , when mr @entity32 stumbled across worrying hoards of young children armed with assault rifles			1
he started accumulating banned @entity114 's from around the continent , melting them down , recycling them and turning them into fine jewelry			0
' each piece of jewelry worn represents a gun which is no longer on the street killing somebody ' the proceeds were churned back into the project of destroying guns - about 35,000 of them in @entity105 over the last three years - simultaneously making a broader political statement about the problem at hand			0
in the words of one of @entity8 's collaborating designers , @entity138 : ' each piece of jewelry worn represents a gun which is no longer on the street killing somebody ' .			2

the $ 98 bracelet was created in partnership with @entity8 , a philanthropic cause which aims to reduce gun violence in the @entity10
