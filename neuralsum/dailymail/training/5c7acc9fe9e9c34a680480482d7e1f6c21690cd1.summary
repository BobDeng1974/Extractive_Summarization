@entity1 could cause blindness in men with eye problems , and even those with seemingly normal vision , a new study has found			1
@entity8 researchers say an ingredient in anti-impotence drugs may permanently affect the vision of men with an inherited eye condition			1
it could also affect those with normal sight who carry one gene which is linked with developing eye problems			1
it is already known that sildenafil , the active ingredient in the erectile dysfunction medication , can cause temporary vision problems in some healthy people			2
doctors have now warned it could also cause permanent damage to the eyes of people retinitis pigmentosa			1
people with normal sight that carry the gene for the condition may also be at risk , experts warn			1
retinitis pigmentosa is a rare hereditary condition that causes the cells in the retina - the area of the back of the eye which detects light - to degenerate and die			1
this can lead to difficulty seeing in dim light , loss of peripheral vision , and sometimes blindness			0
about one in 50 people are likely to be carriers of genes which lead to the degeneration of cells in the retina			2
loss of hearing in 2011 , @entity1 and similar impotence drugs were linked to hundreds of cases of sudden hearing loss around the world			2
research published in the journal @entity74 said it was not clear how long the problems lasted , but this type of hearing loss - more commonly due to infections and exposure to loud noise - usually causes permanent damage in up to a third of cases			0
skin cancer earlier this year , @entity86 researchers found that men who used @entity1 were 84 per cent more likely to get melanoma , the most deadly form of skin cancer			2
it is thought the impotence drug may affect the same genetic mechanism that enables skin cancer to become more invasive			0
in the new study , researchers from the @entity96 , @entity8 , tested sildenafil on healthy mice and mice with one copy of this mutant gene			0
they found the healthy mice experienced problems with their eyes for about two days			0
however the drug affected the vision of mice who carried the mutant gene for two weeks			0
the researchers also found early signs that the cells in the mice 's eyes were dying , suggesting sildenafil may cause loss of vision in people who carry the gene for the disease but have normal vision			1
dr @entity123 , of the @entity124 , said : ' if cells actually die in the retina that would lead to blindness			0
' people who have normal vision , but who carry a single copy of the mutant gene for retinitis pigmentosa , could be more susceptible to changes caused by sildenafil , she added			1
the study was published in the journal @entity139 news comes after reports that @entity141 is braced for a ' @entity142 ' after the drug 's patent ran out last year			0
the cost plummeted by 93 per cent as cheaper generic versions of the drug became available			0
previous studies have linked @entity1 and other anti-impotence drugs to side effects such as deafness			0
@entity86 researchers also found that men who used @entity1 increased their risk of developing skin cancer			2

@entity1 may cause loss of vision in men with retinitis pigmentosa
retinitis pigmentosa is a rare inherited eye condition causing sight loss
some people have normal vision but carry one gene for the condition
ingredient in @entity1 linked to *degenration* and death of cells in the retina
people with retinitis pigmentosa and those who carry the gene at risk
