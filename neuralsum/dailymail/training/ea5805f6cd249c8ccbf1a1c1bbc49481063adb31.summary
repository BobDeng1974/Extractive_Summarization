the eerie hum of thousands of potentially deadly arrows pouring down on to the field of @entity3 is set to be recreated for the first time in six centuries			1
an ambitious project is underway to allow up to 1,000 archers to recreate @entity9 ’s celebrated victory in northern @entity10			1
it was 598 years ago today – also a friday – that the @entity13 king ’s heavily outnumbered army defeated a @entity16 force close to the small town of @entity18 , as it is spelt in @entity16			1
relive : up to 1,000 archers could set foot again on the battlefield of @entity3 to recreate the famous victory for @entity9 but the 600th anniversary of october 25th 1415 will be a far more significant one , with historians on both sides of the @entity26 already suggesting ways of commemorating it			1
the @entity29 , an @entity16 re-enactment group supported by the town ’s historical centre and local tourist agencies , is now proposing a ‘ @entity33 ’			2
the @entity29 ’s website reads : ‘ we want to recreate an arrow storm with at least 1,000 archers , ’ adding : ‘ we need a minimum 1,000 archer block to try and recreate @entity9 's first arrow volley made in 1415			1
each archer will need a minimum 30 suitably specified arrows			0
’ brutality : reenactors want to recreate the drama of the battle captured in this illustration of @entity45 and @entity3 moment in history : there are a few reminders in @entity3 , pictured as it is today , that the fields around the village had been the scene of a pivotal battle between old foes @entity13 and @entity10 outnumbered but victorious : exactly 598 years ago today , the @entity13 king 's heavily outnumbered army defeated a @entity16 force near the small town of @entity3 this means rubber blunted arrows fitted with long wooden shafts and fletched with real white feathers			1
the @entity29 adds : ‘ this event will also give an opportunity to historians and academics alike to confirm or review their opinions of this battle , was the @entity13 archer as decisive as believed ? ’ when battle commenced at 11 a.m. on october 25 , the @entity13 army was seemingly destined for annihilation			1
numbering around 20,000 , the @entity16 army was fresh , well - equipped and disciplined			2
their opponents were depleted to about 5,000 men after two months of exhausting campaigning			0
but it has a secret weapon : their archers			0
the @entity16 were met by a furious bombardment of artillery from the @entity13 archers , who wielded innovative longbows with a range of 250 yards			1
@entity16 knights were totally unprepared to meet that weapon			2
weighed down with heavy armour and become bogged down on the narrow and slightly upward sloping battlefield , they were a sitting target			0
as more knights entered the battle they became even more vulnerable to a cascade of deadly arrows			0
almost 6,000 @entity10 lost their lives during the @entity3 , while @entity13 deaths amounted to just over 400			2
the stunning victory turned the tide for the @entity13 during the @entity100 ( 1337 – 1453 ) for control of the @entity16 throne			1
@entity9 was eventually recognized in 1420 as heir to the @entity16 throne and the regent of @entity10			1
but @entity10 would go on to eventually win the @entity100			2
a trained archer could shoot six aimed arrows a minute which could wound at 400 yards , kill at 200 and penetrate armour at 100 yards			0
while @entity9 ’s decisive victory in the @entity100 has never been in dispute , there have been numerous arguments about the manner in which it was achieved			1
some have underplayed the effectiveness of the legendary @entity13 and @entity117 bowmen who took part , suggesting that more underhand tactics ensured a @entity122 victory , which was immortalised by @entity124 ’s play ‘ @entity9 ’			1
in the past , the @entity10 have even accused their ‘ perfidious ’ foes of acting like war criminals by slaughtering hundreds of prisoners , many of them knights from noble @entity130 families			0
the narrow field where the battle took place remains remarkably unchanged , and an archery range will be set up across its length			2
marching troops dressed in the armour of the period will move towards the archers in what will undoubtedly be the most ambitious recreation of the battle ever attempted			0
the spectacular commemoration will come at a time when @entity10 and @entity145 are preparing to mark the significant anniversaries of numerous great battles			0
these include @entity149 , which took place in 1815 , and many of the great actions of @entity152 , which started in 1914			0
recreations are particularly popular in @entity10 , where strict safety procedures are followed to try and stop anyone getting hurt			0
cautionary advice on the @entity29 website reads : ‘ all weapons must be blunted ... axes , maces and flails are not permitted on the battlefield during combat			0

up to 1,000 *enthusiasts* set to recreate the battle of @entity3
event will mark 600th anniversary of famous @entity13 victory over @entity16
on october 25th , 1415 , @entity9 's 5,000 troops defeated force of 20,000
@entity9 took @entity16 throne *shortly* after critical battle of @entity100
