championship clubs spent over £ 14million on agents fees last season , with play - off winners @entity4 topping the bill			1
@entity7 's side paid over £ 1.8million to players ' representatives in the 2013/14 , on their way to reaching the @entity11 thanks to a @entity13 goal at @entity14			0
unsurprisingly three of the league 's four lowest spenders were relegated , with only cash - strapped @entity17 ( £ 10,000 ) paying agents less than @entity20 ( £ 61,550 ) , @entity21 ( 131,380 ) and @entity22 ( £ 221,445 )			2
well worth it : @entity4 may have spent a lot of money on agents but it paid off when they won the play - off final in the money : @entity13 's strike at @entity14 ensured @entity4 more than made their money back however @entity30 and @entity31 showed that big spending is not always needed to get results , between them paying out under £ 700,000 and finishing first and second respectively			2
the other sides to splash the cash were @entity36 ( £ 1,681,080 ) , @entity37 ( £ 1,460,460 ) and @entity38 ( £ 1,656,446 )			0
between them the four biggest spenders account for 45 per cent of the @entity42 's total output to agents			2
expenses : @entity45 , signed from @entity31 , was one of 11 players brought in last season costly : @entity48 were the second highest spenders , @entity50 one of their 13 signings in total the @entity52 spent 18 per cent less last season than the previous year , but agents still raked in an average of over £ 32,000 per transfer in the @entity42			1
according to the @entity52 's chief executive , @entity57 , the reduction was a result of the league 's new @entity60 regulations			0
however , he stressed that the more than £ 17million spent on agents was still ' a very significant sum leaving the game '			1
who needs money : @entity30 won last season 's championship despite just £ 343,900 on agents ' fees ' the 2013/14 campaign was the first season against which sanctions will be applied in all three of our divisions under @entity52 's @entity60 rules			1
it is therefore notable that we have seen a significant fall in payments to agents			0
' hopefully this is a sign that they are having a positive effect but it 's too early to know for definite at this stage			0
' whilst a reduction of £ 4m is welcome there is still a very significant sum leaving the game to pay agents			1
' video we started badly - @entity7			0
