by 2050 , a completely new type of human will evolve as a result of radical new technology , behaviour , and natural selection			0
this is according to @entity7 , a researcher at the @entity8 , who claims mankind is undergoing a major ' evolutionary transition '			1
in less than four decades , mr @entity7 claims we will live longer , have children in old age and rely on artificial intelligence to do mundane tasks			1
' your 80 or 100 is going to be so radically different than your grandparents , ' mr @entity7 says , who believe we will spend much of our time living in virtual reality			1
some evolutionary scientists believe this age could be as high as 120 by 2050			1
mr @entity7 claims humans will also demonstrate delayed sexual maturation , according to a report by @entity37 in @entity38			1
this refers to something known as life history theory which attempts to explain how natural selection shape key events in a creature 's life , such as reproduction			0
this shift is so significant , says mr last , that it is comparable to the change from apes into humans			1
' your 80 or 100 is going to be so radically different than your grandparents , ' he claims mr @entity7 predicts that by 2050 , humans will live significantly longer , robots will replace unskilled jobs , women will have children older and people will have more time to engage in cultural activities it suggests that as brain sizes increase , organisms need more energy and time to reach their full potential , and so reproduce less			1
instead of living fast and dying young , mr @entity7 believes humans will live slow and die old			1
' global society at the moment is a complete mess , ' he told @entity69			0
' but in crisis there is opportunity , and in apocalypse there can be metamorphosis			0
' so i think the next system humanity creates will be far more sophisticated , fair , and abundant than our current civilisation			0
' i think our next system will be as different from the modern world , as our contemporary world is from the medieval world			0
' ' the biological clock is n't going to be around forever , ' he added , and said that people could pause it for some time using future technology			1
and as well as having more child - free years to enjoy leisure time , mr @entity7 believes artificial intelligence will offset the need for low - skill jobs			1
his views wrote a paper , titled ' @entity96 , @entity97 , and the @entity98 ' published current aging science the change is already happening			2
today , the average age at which a woman in @entity103 has her first baby has been rising steadily stands at 29.8			2
in the @entity106 , just one per cent of first children were born to women over the age of 35 in 1970			2
by 2012 , that figure rose to 15 per cent			0
' as countries become socioeconomically advanced , more and more people , especially women , have the option to engage in cultural reproduction , ' mr @entity7 added			1
and as well as having more child - free years to enjoy leisure time , he believes artificial intelligence will offset the need for low - skill jobs			2
we may also spend a large amount of time living in virtual reality			1
' i 'm not quite sure most people have really internalised the implications of this possibility , ' mr @entity7 said			1
his views are detailed in a paper , titled ' @entity96 , @entity97 , and the end of @entity130 ' published current aging science			2
by 2040 , cabs will be driven by @entity135 robots , shops will become showrooms for online outlets and call centres will be staffed by intelligent droids			2
that ’s the scenario depicted in recent research which suggests robots could be taking over our lives and jobs in less than 30 years			0
the competition for work caused by a rise in the robots population will see us heading to surgeons for ‘ additional processing power for our brains ’ , they claim			0
we may also be requesting bionic implants for our hands that will make us able to perform tasks as fast as any machine			0
@entity158 , commissioned by global job search website xpatjobs.com , say workers will have less job security and will work more unsociable hours			0
those who take these risks and innovate with their own bodies will be the biggest earners in 2040 , they claim			0
however , the study added that workers may be left with poor eyesight , smaller sexual organs , and constantly - furrowed brows as they struggle to keep up to life in the 21st century			0
the study predicts that by 2050 a typical male worker , aged 35 , will have red eyes , a smaller penis , a larger brain , advanced language skills and bioimplants to improve their performance			0

this is according to @entity7 , a researcher at the @entity8
mr @entity7 claims we will live longer , have kids in old age and rely on robots
we may also end up spending a large amount of our time in virtual reality
huge shift is comparable to the change from apes to humans , he says
' your 80 or 100 is going to be so radically different than your grandparents , ' he argues . ' the biological clock is n't going to be around forever '
