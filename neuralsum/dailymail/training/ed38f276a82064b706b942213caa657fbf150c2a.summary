by @entity0 published : 04:38 est , 8 january 2013 updated : 06:31 est , 8 january 2013 the company that runs @entity3 's train network today announced plans to invest £ 37.5billion on upgrading and expanding the country 's railways			2
@entity7 intends to provide 170,000 extra seats for commuters at peak times by 2019			1
but with 225million more passengers expected to be travelling by that time , the firm said it would not make any attempt to crack down on trains running late			2
and there have been warnings that the plan will require a massive new injection of taxpayer funding and lead to even more inflation - busting fare hikes			1
expansion : @entity23 plans to upgrade @entity3 's train systems have been announced by @entity7 the @entity7 plans come at a time of passenger fury at the 4.2 per cent rise in the average price of season tickets which took effect this month , as public anger has grown at the lavish salaries and bonuses enjoyed by train bosses			1
the organisation 's chief executive warned that the industry had entered ' the era of trade - offs ' as it faced pressure to cut costs , and said fares may have to rise again to pay the bill for the latest expansion			2
' increasingly we have to balance the need to build more infrastructure , run trains on time and cut costs , and in many areas choices will need to be made , ' sir @entity46 said			0
the @entity7 plans - which must be approved by the @entity55 to take effect - cover the period 2014 - 19			1
they envisage 225million more passengers per year travelling and 355,000 more trains in service - the highest numbers ever			2
20 per cent extra morning peak seats into central @entity62 will be provided , along with 32 per cent more into large regional cities in @entity64 and @entity65			0
hotspots : this map shows the main lines and stations which will benefit from the @entity7 programme tight squeeze : @entity7 hopes to introduce 170,000 extra seats on the morning commute 700 more trains a day will link key northern cities , with a 10 - minute reduction in journey time between @entity77 and @entity78			1
carbon dioxide emissions per passenger will be reduced by 37 per cent , while the network of more than 800 signal boxes is intended to be streamlined into just 14 major operations centres			0
overall , @entity7 hopes to reduce the cost of running @entity3 's railways by 18 per cent , and cut annual public subsidy to between £ 2.6billion and £ 2.9billion in 2019 - down from £ 4.5billion in 2009 and £ 7billion in 2004			1
projects include various electrification schemes , including the @entity89 and @entity90 , station improvements at @entity92 and @entity93 , and reopening 31 miles of railways in @entity95 closed under the @entity97 cuts of 50 years ago			0
compromise : chief executive sir @entity46 has warned a funding squeeze will lead to cutbacks while the company has failed to meet its current target of 92.5 per cent punctuality for the current period , it insists that the goal will be achieved by the end of 2019			1
but even with extra trains and seats this will ' not be enough ' on the busy @entity111 , according to @entity7 , which insists the added capacity of the @entity62 to @entity92 high - speed rail line is ' essential '			1
sir @entity46 said : ' one million more trains run every year than 10 years ago , more passengers arrive on time than ever before , our safety record is one of the best in @entity121 and , despite the daily challenges we face , customer satisfaction is at record levels			1
' successive governments have made this possible by looking beyond the short term and recognising the critical importance of the railway to @entity3 's future			0
' @entity130 , general secretary of the @entity131 , said : ' while we support any plans to expand and invest in @entity3 's railways , you can not seriously expect to safely increase capacity while at the same time the government is looking to axe key frontline staff on trains , track and stations			2
' ' if the @entity137 press on with the jobs cuts plans , they will simply be cramming more and more people into an overcrowded and unreliable service where safety is compromised and the profits of the private train operators are prioritised			0
that is simply a recipe for disaster			0
' @entity55 ( @entity55 ) chief executive @entity154 said : ' ministers have shown huge faith in what the railways can add to @entity3 's society and economy , committing to around £ 20 billion - worth of public money at a time when there is little money to go around			0
' key to maintaining rail 's success will be openly justifying this significant commitment of public money			0
taxpayers significantly fund the railways , and have every right see where this money is being spent			0
' @entity173 , leader of the @entity175 rail union , warned ministers against big annual fare hikes to pay for rail expansion			1
he said : ' we obviously back rail investment to improve the service but passengers have already suffered enough pain with a decade of annual inflation - plus fare increases			2
' they should not now be expected to face another six years of even higher fares			0

passengers could face fare hikes as plans for system expansion *revealed*
