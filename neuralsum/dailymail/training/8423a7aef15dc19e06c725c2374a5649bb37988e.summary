@entity4 was born with the rare condition which means the right side of her heart is underdeveloped and unable to pump enough blood around her body			1
the serious congenital heart defect , hypoplastic right heart syndrome , affects some 600 babies every year and many of those die within just days of being born			1
living life to the full : @entity4 , 8 , was born with the rare condition which means the right side of her heart is underdeveloped and unable to pump enough blood around her body @entity4 underwent surgery at 13 weeks old and aged four , and will need a full heart transplant as she continues to grow			1
now aged eight , @entity4 is a determined little girl living on ‘ borrowed time ’ , her mother @entity20 , 43 , of @entity21 said			2
she said : ‘ we feel like we 're on borrowed time with @entity4 , so we make sure that every day counts			2
‘ we make the most of our time and we spoil @entity4 rotten			2
whatever she wants to do , if we can make it happen , we will do it			0
‘ we always carry a camera with us as we want to get memories of @entity4 all the time and we 're always doing something			0
’ life - saving surgery : @entity4 ( pictured with mother @entity20 in hospital ) had to undergo surgery aged just 13 - weeks - old after the serious heart defect was discovered living on ' borrowed time ' : @entity4 ( pictured left aged four months and right aged two ) must one day have a full heart transplant when it is anticipated her heart will fail and so her family makes ' every day count ' , says mother ms @entity20 @entity4 ’s serious heart defect , hypoplastic right heart syndrome , was not discovered until she was six - weeks - old			1
parents ms @entity20 and @entity45 , 46 , first learned something was wrong when a routine check - up detected their daughter had a heart murmur			0
subsequent tests and examinations revealed that she had the condition and would need intensive treatment at the region 's children 's heart unit to survive			0
it came as a shock to the family as the pregnancy had gone smoothly and @entity4 was born a healthy baby at the @entity63 , weighing 7lb 10oz			2
ms @entity4 said : ‘ when we were first told that @entity4 had heart failure i immediately thought that she was not going to make it			2
‘ it came as a shock as she looked like any other child her age and was doing everything that you would expect a baby to do			0
’ mr @entity45 has a heart defect and so ms @entity20 had undergone an extra pregnancy scan to see if her daughter also had a problem with the organ			1
shock diagnosis : born a healthy baby , it came as a shock when @entity4 was diagnosed with the condition which kills many babies within days of being born , but she has proved to be a determined little girl , undergoing surgery again when she was four ( pictured ) however , all scans came back clear and it was thought that @entity4 was growing and developing as expected			1
@entity4 's serious complex congenital condition puts added pressure on the working side of the heart as it compensates for the damaged side			1
this added pressure will eventually lead to organ failure , when she will need a heart transplant			1
@entity4 finds it difficult to walk up stairs as she easily gets out of breath and her lips and fingernails often turn blue due to the lower oxygen levels in her blood			0
' centre of attention ' : @entity4 ' has a mind of her own ' says ms @entity20 ( pictured together with brothers @entity108 , left , 10 , and @entity110 , five ) it is anticipated that @entity4 will need a heart transplant in the future and will then spend a lifetime on anti-rejection medication			1
@entity4 's siblings @entity116 , 25 , @entity118 , 23 , @entity108 , 10 , and @entity110 , five , do not have any heart problems			2
but despite all she has gone through , @entity4 is a determined girl			0
ms @entity20 said : ‘ @entity4 has a mind of her own and loves being the centre of attention			0
she is a real girly girl			0
‘ i ca n't put into words how great the team is at the @entity127 's children 's heart unit as they do an outstanding job			0
‘ they give you so much confidence that your child is going to get the best care possible and that everything will be done to help			0
