she said : ' ever since my brother died strange things have occurred in every house i ’ve lived in , it ’s been a living hell			1
among the spooky happenings that ms @entity7 has recorded is a light fixture swinging from the ceiling ' probably the worst time was when i was pinned to the bed , i ’ll never forget it - it was very traumatic			1
' i believe this is happening because death has always followed me , but i have strong suspicions the spirit could be my brother , who died when i was younger			2
' we had a very troubled relationship , perhaps that ’s why he ’s come back to haunt me			0
