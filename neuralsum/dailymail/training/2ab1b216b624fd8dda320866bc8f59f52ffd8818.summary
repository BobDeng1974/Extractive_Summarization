scathing : the reviewers wrote @entity19 ( pictured here in 1966 ) off as ' amateurish and out of tune ' how wrong could you be ? @entity19 ( left ) has an impressive career behind him while @entity3 ( right ) has a wildly successful career and performs all over the globe who they liked ... and who they did n't the producers said : ‘ amateur sounding vocalist who sings wrong notes and out of tune			1
