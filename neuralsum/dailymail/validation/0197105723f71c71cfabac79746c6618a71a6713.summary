as the scorer of @entity3 ’s first - ever competitive goal , it was little wonder that history - maker @entity5 felt like a @entity7 when he left @entity8 on sunday night			1
however , as the 33 - year - old @entity10 policeman would later reveal , he was not the first man from the tiny @entity13 overseas territory to make an arresting impact at the @entity15			2
if the outstanding memory of the 2002 @entity18 for most people remains @entity21 ’s exquisite volleyed goal , in @entity3 it was the sight of local businessman @entity22 invading the park clad in a kilt and a @entity26 strip			1
@entity3 's players celebrate after @entity5 scored their first ever competitive goal on sunday @entity22 would later appear on @entity3 ’s version of @entity30 , before eventually falling foul of the law and out of the public eye			1
his place as the most famous man in @entity3 now passes to @entity5 after criminal defending by @entity37 allowed the cop to race clear , fire low past @entity39 and utterly stun @entity8			1
for the striker , all the years spent pounding the hard yards on pavements and playing in sub-standard facilities were worth it as he followed in the famous footsteps of @entity21 by scoring a goal to remember in mount @entity48			2
@entity5 ( centre ) celebrates the goal that will have made him the most famous man in @entity3 ‘ it was a @entity53 who jumped out of the stand and onto the park in his kilt and his @entity26 shirt in that @entity18 in 2002			1
i remember that well , ’ he beamed			0
‘ it was just a dream come true for me to score that goal			1
it ’s unimaginable to get the first competitive goal for @entity3			1
‘ i do n’t think i will get a hero ’s reception when i get home			0
we still lost the game – but it is still an achievement to get the goal			2
@entity3 goalkeeper @entity69 celebrates the goal at @entity8 , which levelled the score at 1 - 1 ‘ we have only just joined @entity72 and started to train on a football pitch			1
all my life , we ’ve been training wherever we can , running on the road , or for 90 minutes a week on a seven - a - side pitch			2
‘ even two or three years ago i did n’t think i would be playing for @entity3 because i did n’t think we would get into @entity72			1
everything has happened so fast and we are learning every day			0
‘ this goal is something that i will cherish for the rest of my life			0
i knew it was going in as soon as i hit it			0
it was a great feeling			0
‘ i swapped my second shirt with @entity83 but i kept my shirt from the first half			0
i am going to put it up in my house ! but i ’m hoping there are more goals to come for me in future			0
’ @entity5 ( right ) vies for the ball with @entity37 's @entity83 , who he later swapped shirts with despite ultimately losing 6 - 1 to @entity95 ’s side , @entity5 hopes that his own stunning effort will alter perceptions of those who have labelled the minnows little more than a pub team			1
‘ i would think we have shown that we are not , ’ he said			0
‘ we are improving and we do try to play football , which is not bad considering we have only just started and were drawn in the most difficult group			0
we try to create a good game for the spectators to watch			0
’ last june , the first - ever winning goal scored by the @entity107 - with a 30,000 - population comparable with @entity109 - was slotted home in a 1 - 0 friendly win over @entity112 in @entity113			1
that night the history - maker was @entity115 , @entity5 ’s brother , who was an unused substitute on sunday			1
a third brother , @entity116 , played in defence for @entity3 at @entity8 in front of proud parents @entity120 and @entity121			1
@entity5 's brother @entity116 , who also plays for the national team , shares a joke with @entity125 ‘ i ’m keeping it in the family , ’ smiled @entity5			1
‘ my mum and dad watch us home and away and they were here today			0
we have to go to @entity132 in @entity113 to play our home games , but they have always been there for us			0
it is thanks to them that we are here			0
it is a dream for them to have three sons playing at a high level			2
i do n’t think that happens very often in the world of football to have three brothers in an international squad			0
’ with the benefit of having played all the @entity149 teams now , @entity5 feels that @entity37 and @entity150 – who meet in @entity152 in june - will be in a battle for third place behind @entity155 and @entity156			1
‘ @entity156 are the world champions and @entity155 are a very strong and physical team , ’ said @entity5 , who jetted off to @entity157 on holiday after sunday 's game			1
‘ i think it is between @entity37 and @entity150 to finish in third spot			2
the @entity165 man was @entity37 's hat - trick hero as he netted the country 's first hat - trick since 1969 ‘ i thought we showed a good reaction after falling behind			1
and i thought the @entity172 fans were a bit apprehensive when we equalised			0
‘ but @entity37 ’s second and third goals killed us			2
we are n’t professionals and to try and maintain that sort of level was very hard for us			0
‘ but our manager @entity178 was very proud of us afterwards			0
and i think the whole of @entity3 will be proud as well			2

@entity37 beat @entity3 6 - 1 at @entity8 on sunday *afternoon*
at one point , the scores were level at 1 - 1 when @entity5 equalised
the strike marked @entity3 's first competitive goal in their history
@entity5 says the goal was a dream come true , an ' unimaginable moment '
