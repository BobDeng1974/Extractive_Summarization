by @entity0 the only clue that this ordinary - looking van gives to show it ’s not just your average transit is the chimney protruding from the roof			1

he said : ‘ i ’m a stinky hippy , i barely shower anyway ! ’ mr @entity16 , who is 6ft 2ins , will also have to contend with the compact space			0
room for three : mr @entity16 , who is 6ft tall , plans to sleep in the foetal position in the tiny bed compact : the inside of the van , which is 1.7 metres by 1.8 metres , contains a bed , kitchen and wood burner while the van seems to contain all the mod cons , it does not however contain a toilet mr @entity16 , 24 , and and ms @entity17 , 25 , from @entity64 , plan to travel in the van around @entity21 the living area measures 1.7 metres wide by 1.8 metres			1
