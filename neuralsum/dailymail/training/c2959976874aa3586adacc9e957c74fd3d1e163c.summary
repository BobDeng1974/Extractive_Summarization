three county matches are being investigated by the @entity10 ’s anti-corruption unit as part of a wide - ranging probe based on evidence from former @entity15 batsman @entity14			1
they are looking at two games from @entity14 ’s time at @entity19 in 2011 — a @entity20 and a 40 - over contest — plus another @entity20 he played for @entity22 in 2008			2
advice : @entity24 and @entity2 batsman @entity1 believes county players need greater education on match - fixing the revelations overshadowed the much - publicised launch of the revamped domestic t20 tournament , the @entity30			1

he said : ‘ nobody wants this , it ’s a beautiful game			0
the last thing we want to do is put fans off			0
we want to keep this game as clean as possible and keep the fans enjoying it			0
it ’s a horrible place to be when the fans are questioning everything			0
