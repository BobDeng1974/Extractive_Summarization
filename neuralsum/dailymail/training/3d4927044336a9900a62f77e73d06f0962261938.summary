lush grounds : the property sits on 15.8 acres and has a horse pasture @entity49 : it also has three bedrooms and a large living room big money : @entity0 bought the property in 1991 for just under $ 1.2million nature : the ranch sits on the banks of the @entity33 @entity0 tried to sell the property last year as well for the same exact price , a big step up from the $ 1.164million he paid for it in 1991			1
the @entity6 estate meanwhile is a 17th - century mansion that sits on 200 acres of land , and was purchased for just $ 3.1million by @entity0 in 1999			1
