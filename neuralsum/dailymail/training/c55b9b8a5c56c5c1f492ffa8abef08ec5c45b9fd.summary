helping hand ? @entity2 researchers found that we now use the internet to remember ' for us ' - and decide not to store facts if we think we can @entity6 them later the @entity9 is becoming our main source of memory instead of our own brains , a study has concluded			1
in the age of @entity6 , our minds are adapting so that we are experts at knowing where to find information even though we do n’t recall what it is			1
the researchers found that when we want to know something we use the internet as an ‘ external memory ’ just as computers use an external hard drive			0
nowadays we are so reliant on our smart phones and laptops that we go into ‘ withdrawal when we ca n’t find out something immediately ’			0
and such is our dependence that having our internet connection severed is growing ‘ more and more like losing a friend ’			0
researchers from @entity2 , the @entity34 and @entity35 in the @entity36 carried out four tests to check their theory			2
they involved giving test participants a trivia quiz and then seeing whether they recognised computer - related words more quickly than other words			2
the other tests involved seeing if people remembered 40 pieces information they would typically later have normally looked up			1
the third and fourth parts of the study involved checking how well people remember where to look up information on - line and whether or not they remembered the location more than the actual data			1
the results showed that when people do n’t believe they will need information for a later test , they do not recall it at the same rate as when they do believe they will need it			1
your @entity6 brain in fact , some of those in the study ‘ actively did not make the effort to remember when they thought they could later look up the trivia statements they had read ’ , the paper says			1
the other results showed that when continuous internet access is expected , people are better at remembering where they can find it than the details			2
the study was lead by @entity80 , an assistant professor at the department of psychology at @entity35			0
in their paper , the researchers say that we now have access to the @entity9 24 hours a day meaning we are ' seldom offline unless by choice ' and it is ' hard to remember how we found information before the @entity9 became a ubiquitous presence in our lives '			1
the paper reads : ‘ the advent of the @entity9 , with sophisticated algorithmic search engines , has made accessing information as easy as lifting a finger			2
‘ no longer do we have to make costly efforts to find the things we want			0
we can ‘ @entity6 ’ the old classmate , find articles online , or look up the actor who was on the tip of our tongue			1
‘ when faced with difficult questions , people are primed to think about computers and that when people expect to have future access to information , they have lower rates of recall of the information itself and enhanced recall instead for where to access it			1
‘ the internet has become a primary form of external or transactive memory , where information is stored collectively outside ourselves			0
’ the study is not the first to touch on such anxieties and similar fears were addressed in ‘ the @entity124 : how the @entity9 is rewiring our brains ’ , a book released last year			0
its author , @entity36 technologist @entity127 , talks of how we are unable to concentrate for long periods because of how using the web has affected us			0
in research he commissioned for the book , test subjects said they were unable to read copies of @entity137 ’s ‘ @entity136 ’ because their minds had been altered			0
others were disturbed at how they could only think in ‘ staccato ’ bursts because they had become little more than ‘ decoders of information ' .			0

people remember where to look up information - not the info itself
people actively forget information if they think they can look it up later
tests on how people remembered items they would normally @entity6
