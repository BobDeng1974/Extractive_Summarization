one of the brightest young managers in @entity2 football is n’t sure how many gcses he ’s got , except to say ‘ not many ’			1
but when it comes to learning on the job , @entity5 has acquired enough to fill a few textbooks			1
‘ i ’ll need them for this game , ’ he told @entity9			1
@entity12 are in town , a brand that @entity5 compares to @entity14 up against one a touch smaller and more maligned			1
a manager of great achievements and arrogance is going up against a man 30 years his junior , who tends to think like someone a little older			1
‘ one thing that gets me is players wearing headphones when they come off the coach , ’ @entity5 said			1
‘ i ’ve stopped that here			2
total football : @entity27 boss @entity5 is looking forward to pitting his wits against @entity29 relaxed : @entity5 talks candidly to @entity9 's @entity30 at @entity31 ahead of tuesday 's game ‘ i find it disrespectful			1
if a man worked hard all week , bought a ticket and comes to watch us with his kid , you show them respect			2
look at them and say “ hello ” , sign an autograph			2
that ’ll make a kid ’s day and then his dad is happy too			2
‘ i can sound like a 40 or 50 - year - old man , but things like that mean a lot to me			1
’ in fact , @entity5 is 33 , possibly one of the oldest 33 year olds in football			1
in the years since his playing days ended as a teenager with an injured back , he has crammed a fair bit in , from coaching at @entity59 ’s @entity58 ’s academy , to working under @entity60 and @entity61			2
he is victim to pranks from @entity63 , calls in @entity64 occasionally for striker sessions – ‘ i need top players beside me because i ca n’t talk to a player about the @entity68 because i did n’t do it ’ – and in all has managed more than 200 games			1
this is his biggest opponent , though , and the latest chance to learn something			0
‘ believe me , i ’d love to have a chat to @entity29 , ’ he said			0
‘ i love @entity76 football			1
after a game on a saturday i love to jump on the @entity78			1
i ’ll go to @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81			1
' i ’ll go to watch @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , anything			2
it ’s a chance to take in another culture , another system , a way of doing things			2
van the man : @entity5 spoke of his love for @entity76 football and the influence it has had at @entity27 football addict : the 33 - year - old said he tries to experience different styles of football whenever he can and often jumps on the @entity78 to watch teams like @entity85 and @entity83 after @entity27 have played on a saturday @entity76 master : @entity29 's @entity12 side have failed to impress in their first games of season ‘ look at what @entity104 did at @entity106			1
i ’m enthralled by how @entity76 clubs have a connection through the age groups			1
‘ here , i have a numerical system			2
all @entity111 8s through the age range will look the same , all no 6s will drop into the same places			1
they do that in @entity81 , at @entity106			1
‘ i ’d very much hope to get a chance to talk to @entity29			0
people say @entity12 are vulnerable			1
come on , it ’s @entity12			1
‘ but we are going to give our best			0
@entity59 used to tell me that failure is not trying			0
he helped give me standards and those standards run through this club			0
’ eyes on the prize : @entity5 's team on the other hand , have won four of their first five games this campaign leading by example : @entity27 captain @entity131 will relish the chance to test himself against @entity12 beyond @entity5 ’s father , who made his @entity58 - supporting son clap off @entity136 after they won the 1989 title on the final day at @entity138 , @entity133 was his first major mentor			1
‘ it ’s ridiculous that @entity59 has not been utilised more in the game , ’ he said			2
‘ i remember him doing a crossing session at @entity58			0
he was stood out wide and getting the players to pass to him			0
a kid rolled him the ball and he smashed it back			2
“ this is @entity58 , i was an international and so are the rest of the team you ’ll be playing with			0
‘ the kid was about 12			0
@entity59 got messages into people , including me			0
i have been so lucky to learn from the people i have			0
i went from @entity58 to here to coach with @entity60			0
he would park his car and race me to the building			0
‘ his self - drive was incredible			2
he made me want to be better every day			0
we went to @entity159 and i can tell you no - one knows more than @entity60 about players – in my phone he is “ @entity163 ”			2
it ’s mad that @entity60 is not working			0
‘ when he left @entity159 and @entity61 came in , i remember thinking i ’d be going too			0
i was on the @entity166 and the phone rings , withheld number			0
‘ i heard , “ @entity5 , it ’s @entity61			1
it went on for 15 minutes			0
i am answering in my poshest scouse voice			0
‘ i put the phone down , 15 minutes later it goes again			0
“ @entity5 , it ’s @entity61 ”			1
i ca n't tell you what i said			0
but it was @entity61 and he wanted me to stay			0
i learnt from him every day as well			0
no - one would do a better job of keeping you in the @entity68			1
he ’s in my phone as @entity180			0
’ ready to do battle : @entity5 stands by the pitch at @entity31 ahead of tuesday night 's @entity184 game expecting more : @entity104 will want an improved performance from his @entity12 side against @entity27 after reuniting with @entity60 at @entity27 , he was appointed manager in 2010 , aged 29			1
he ’s done well , twice delivering play - off places and a cup run every year			1
his thoughts have been sought by @entity191 at the @entity192 and his success is slowly helping the image of the club			0
‘ i have always operated with an understanding of the cloud we are under , ’ he said			0
‘ i made a point of learning it all - i know the club ’s history			2
’ whatever happens in tuesday night 's test against @entity104 , he has already made a pleasant addition .			1

the 33 - year - old told @entity9 he loves @entity76 football and often jumps on the @entity78 to watch matches in @entity81 and @entity80 after @entity27 games
his side face @entity12 in the @entity184 on tuesday night
@entity5 said @entity27 model their youth system on @entity76 sides , with all no 8s and no 6s dropping into same positions throughout age groups
he was appointed manager at @entity27 in 2010 at the age of 29
since then he has taken them to the play - offs and delivered cup runs
@entity27 beat @entity228 3 - 1 in the last round of @entity184
@entity12 come into the game on the back of two *underwhelming* displays in the @entity68 against @entity234 and @entity235
