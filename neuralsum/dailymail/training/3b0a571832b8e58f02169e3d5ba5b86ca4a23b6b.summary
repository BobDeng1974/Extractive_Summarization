by @entity1 reporter published : 18:30 est , 18 february 2014 @entity3 : 20:59 est , 18 february 2014 half an hour a day on an @entity4 or computer can improve eyesight by up to a third and give users superhuman vision , research reveals			2
many of those who took part in the scientific experiment ended up with eyesight much better than normal 20/20 vision - and could read an eye chart from three times further away			1
@entity18 scientists devised a two - month eye training programme that involved spending 25 minutes a day solving visual patterns on a screen – but designed in a way to make the brain work harder rather than the eyes			2
scientists discovered half an hour a day on an @entity4 ( pictured ) or computer can improve eyesight by up to a third the patterns became dimmer and therefore harder to find as the programme wore on - but designed in a way to make the brain work harder rather than the eyes themselves			2
other eyesight training programmes exist but they concentrate on making eye muscles work harder			1
this one , according to its creators , specifically tested the brain because the volunteers had to choose patterns and think about what they were doing			0
and the spectacular results at the end of it defy the traditional belief that looking at a screen every day is bad for your eyes			0
for those who took part in the experiment - in this case members of a @entity18 university baseball team - came out of it with stunning improvements to their basic eyesight			1
according to the results , published in the specialist journal @entity62 , eyesight improved , on average , by 31 per cent among the 19 players taking part			2
baseball players from the @entity67 ( @entity67 ) it meant they could see the ball better as it came to them plus their peripheral vision improved seven players reached a vision level of 20/7.5 ( where 20/20 vision is the norm ) which allows them to read text from 40 feet , almost three times further away than normal			1
for the baseball players from the @entity67 ( @entity67 ) it meant they could see the ball better as it came to them plus their peripheral vision improved			1
they were also able to pick out the ball better in fading light and at night			0
but now the training is being adapted to help others , from professionals such as the police to those who have had operations to remove cataracts and need help to restore their vision			1
study author @entity89 said : ' the goal of the programme is to train the brain to better respond to the inputs that it gets from the eye			0
' our potential is greater than our normal level of performance			0
' when we go to the gym and exercise , we are able to increase our physical fitness ; it ’s the same thing with the brain			0
' by exercising our mental processes we can promote our mental fitness			0

participants often ended up with eyesight much better than 20/20
*basketball* players at the @entity67 , @entity111 showed improvements in their basic eyesight
the training is being adapted to help others *including* the police
