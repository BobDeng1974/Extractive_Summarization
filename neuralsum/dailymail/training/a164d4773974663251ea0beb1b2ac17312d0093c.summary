by @entity0 published : 12:03 est , 17 march 2013 updated : 12:07 est , 17 march 2013 the conservatives were tonight seeking a last - minute agreement on press regulation ahead of a crunch commons vote			1
chancellor @entity5 said this morning that he hoped a last - minute deal could still be found and warned a regulatory system that did not have cross-party support might not last			1
and tonight culture secretary @entity9 suggested that the three political parties may be closer to a compromise			2
getting nearer : culture secretary @entity9 suggested that the three political parties may be closer to a compromise on press regulation rival proposals for a new system of newspaper self - regulation will face judgment tomorrow in a high - stakes battle over the response to the phone - hacking scandal			1
ms @entity9 told @entity22 : ' we 're very clear that we do n't want to see statutory regulation of the press in this country - we think it would have a chilling effect on journalism			1
' i hope that the discussions that we have over the next 24 hours can really make sure that we come together and have a real solution here			0
' i think there 's been compromise on both sides to make the @entity36 work in practice			2
we 're still in the position where the @entity39 have put forward a statutory regulation of the press			1
' we want to take the discussion to @entity43 and i think we can make a very strong case that the royal charter proposals are the right way forward			0
' crunch time : chancellor @entity5 ( pictured on today 's @entity48 ) said he hoped a last - minute deal could still be found and warned a system that did not have cross-party support might not last her comments came after mr @entity5 told @entity54 's @entity48 : ‘ we want to make sure we have a system of press regulation that prevents the abuses we saw in the past happening again , but also makes sure we have a free press			1
‘ that is such a precious thing : people fought - and literally died - to give us a free press			0
the prime minister has already achieved a huge amount in protecting a free press from those who want to undermine it			0
' i hope that the discussions that we have over the next 24 hours can really make sure that we come together and have a real solution here ' culture secretary @entity9 ‘ i would say it would be great on monday if we can get some kind of agreement , even at this late stage , between the parties			2
‘ because , frankly , i think press regulation which is achieved in a way which divides the political parties is not press regulation that is really going to last , and it is not going to be a press regulation which is deeply - rooted in our culture			1
‘ there is still an opportunity for us to get together and get a press law that works			0
ultimately we are not about grandstanding on this ; we are about getting a press law that works			0
’ in a reversal of the @entity90 status quo , @entity39 and the @entity91 are lining up against the conservatives in a coalition for a tougher regime			2
disagreements : the @entity97 plan involves underpinning a system in legislation , something which has been opposed by prime minister @entity101 ( pictured ) as a risk to press freedom both sides propose using a royal charter to create a new watchdog body in response to the recommendations of the @entity36 into abuses by the press			1
but the @entity97 version involves underpinning the system in legislation , something which has been opposed by prime minister @entity101 as a risk to press freedom			1
' i think press regulation which is achieved in a way which divides the political parties is not press regulation that is really going to last , and it is not going to be a press regulation which is deeply - rooted in our culture ' chancellor @entity5 it also rules out a veto for the press over the membership of the watchdog and gives the regulator the power to enforce the publication of prominent apologies			1
mr @entity101 - who dramatically pulled the plug on cross-party talks on thursday - has said he will abide by the will of parliament			2
without an overall commons majority , allies accept he is unlikely to win sufficient support for using the threat of punitive damages against non-participants to persuade papers to sign up			0
despite efforts to shore up the vote - including bringing a minister back from @entity146 - a number of @entity148 are expected to back the @entity97 proposals			2
campaigning : @entity150 urged mps to ' stand up for the victims ' of press abuse by enshrining a new press regulator mr @entity101 insists his proposal is ‘ the fastest possible way to deliver the strong self - regulation body that @entity158 proposed that can put in place million - pound fines , prominent apologies and get justice for victims in this country ’			1
however he yesterday indicated that he did not consider the @entity97 proposed statutory underpinning ‘ a big issue of principle ’ and said he was ‘ confident about the future ’			2
' monday is the day that politics has got to do the duty by the victims and has got to stand up for the victims ' labour leader @entity150 ‘ we 're now in sight of getting that regulator with million pound fines and proper regulation in our country , ’ he said			1
‘ the idea of a law , a great big all singing , all dancing media law that would have been bad for press freedom , bad for individual freedom - that 's off the table			2
’ he insisted he too was acting as ‘ a friend of the victims ’ of phone hacking			0
meanwhile @entity39 leader @entity150 urged mps to ‘ stand up for the victims ’ of press abuse by enshrining a new press regulator			1
‘ monday is the day that politics has got to do the duty by the victims and has got to stand up for the victims , ’ he told the @entity192			2
opinions : actor @entity198 , who fronts the hacked off campaign , said victims would support the @entity97 package even though a royal charter was not ideal and enacts @entity158 only ' reasonably well ' ‘ i think it is an important moment because we have had decades of failing to ensure that we have a system of press complaints and redress which means that ordinary people are n't left at the whim of a sometimes abusive press			1
’ but mr @entity150 said all politicians now needed to follow their instincts about what was right			0
there was criticism of the failure to incorporate fully @entity158 's proposals from the parents of murdered schoolgirl @entity221			1
actor @entity198 , who fronts the hacked off campaign , said victims such as the @entity227 would support the @entity97 package even though a royal charter was not ideal and enacts @entity158 only ‘ reasonably well ’			1
he insisted there were ‘ gigantic differences ’ with the prime minister 's scheme , which was ‘ cunningly designed ’ to return to the previous discredited system			0
‘ it was never ideal that this would be done by royal charter			0
that seemed to us strange to haul this medieval instrument out of history , ’ he told @entity54 's @entity48			0
‘ but the important victims of this - i do not include people like myself , i am talking about people like the @entity244 etc - would be supportive of it , yes			0
‘ mps promised victims to do right by them and they have that chance on monday			0
’ the actor confirmed that he personally called members of the shadow cabinet last week to warn them not to settle ‘ much too early ’ amid signs of cross-party agreement			0
unimpressed : author @entity254 said victims had been ' hung out to dry ' by mr @entity101 and urged @entity39 and the @entity91 to ' have the courage ' to protect them but he dismissed the idea that hacked @entity258 was a ‘ smooth sinister operation ’ - mocking his colleagues such as ex-mp @entity261 and director professor @entity262			1
mr @entity198 said : ‘ it 's a few dandruffy professors sitting in a cheap office with a slightly insane , chess champion @entity268 mp and a couple of threadbare lawyers and me			2
’ shadow culture secretary @entity272 said @entity39 was talking to ‘ many ’ @entity274 mps it hoped to join it - but held out the prospect of mr @entity101 avoiding defeat by doing a deal			1
there were ‘ just a few issues ’ remaining between the two sides - with the ‘ substantive ’ ones being the powers to force prominent apologies and the press veto over membership			0
‘ we 've always said we would like to reach agreement and actually we could then come to the @entity292 with an agreed position and say ' yes , this is what we want , ’ she told the @entity289 programme			0
‘ there are just a few issues that remain between us , but they are quite important ones			0
’ @entity91 deputy leader @entity91 suggested between 20 and 60 @entity273 could rebel and be joined by smaller parties - which would mean a very heavy defeat for mr @entity101			2
‘ on our side of the argument there are conservatives - up to 60 at the maximum but probably 20 core people			0
hopeful : shadow culture secretary @entity272 said @entity39 was talking to ' many ' @entity273 it hoped to join it - but held out the prospect of mr @entity101 avoiding defeat by doing a deal ‘ there are @entity315 parties , nationalist parties , the @entity317 , @entity39 , the @entity91 and possibly some @entity148 - now that 's quite a big coalition			1
’ author @entity254 - who gave evidence to @entity158 about press intrusion into her family 's privacy - said victims had been ‘ hung out to dry ’ by mr @entity101 and urged @entity39 and the @entity91 to ‘ have the courage ’ to protect them			1
she said she would not ‘ support anything that hampers the press 's ability to hold power to account ’ but that the @entity158 recommendations were ‘ reasonable and proportionate ’			1
@entity332 chairman @entity331 said major publishers were ready to sign up to a tough new ‘ @entity335 ’ watchdog but believed statutory underpinning would send a dangerous signal to the world about press freedom			0
he welcomed the parties ' agreement on a royal charter and noted that @entity158 concluded that ‘ the last thing he wanted was statutory press regulation ’			1
‘ all those that i have consulted who are the publishers , they have all agreed to have a new body and a fresh start - with teeth , ’ he told @entity346			0
‘ probably the strongest regulatory body in @entity353 : ability to fine ; ability to carry out investigations			0
‘ they have all signed up to that and they just say “ we do n't need statute ; the last thing we should do is send a message across the world that the @entity363 now has a press law ”			0

@entity9 : ' i hope talks over next 24hrs can ensure we come together '
@entity5 : a system without cross-party support might not last
rival proposals for new press regulation will face judgment tomorrow
both sides propose new watchdog after @entity158 's recommendations
@entity150 says @entity273 should ' stand up for the victims ' of press abuse
@entity198 : victims will support @entity97 package although it is n't ideal
@entity272 : @entity39 is talking to ' many ' @entity273 it hopes to join it
@entity254 : victims have been ' hung out to dry ' by *pm* @entity101
