@entity0 ought to be well prepared to take on the mantle of being one of @entity4 ’s dominant and iconic defenders			1
after all , he plays alongside one in @entity5			1
the @entity12 captain is not in @entity13 despite his resurgence of form in the @entity16 , his decision to quit the team in the wake of his @entity10 racism charge having probably cost him an international swansong			1
nevertheless , it is to the credit of his @entity12 partner , @entity0 , and the form of @entity23 that it has not been a pressing issue in the build - up to saturday ’s game against @entity28 here			1
larger than life : @entity0 insists he has enhanced his game from playing with @entity5 fighting fit : @entity0 goes in on @entity31 as @entity4 are put through their paces ahead of the @entity34 many see central defence as an area of potential weakness in this @entity4 team , but over the past two - and - a - half years @entity0 has quietly been growing into @entity12 ’s most dependable defender , helped of course by the man alongside him			1
‘ i ’ve learned a lot from @entity5 , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ i took things from his leadership and his reading of the game , positionally			0
‘ @entity5 was a leader and i think i ’m accepted at this level now , which is pleasing			1
that ’s not to say there is any sort of complacency in my game			0
there are still people coming up behind you , and i still want to go and achieve as much as i can in my career			0
i just feel i have been accepted at this level			0
’ @entity0 ’s improvement curve has been steady			1
his performances against @entity63 in the @entity65 semi-final of 2012 and @entity66 in the final and then against @entity68 and @entity69 last season have seen him deal with the likes of @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75			0
@entity76 : @entity0 ( left ) celebrates with @entity5 , whom he has formed a rock - solid partnership with @entity78 - born , he grew up watching @entity79 at @entity80 and cites @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 as the dominant @entity4 centre halves he recalls			1
‘ they are goals you have to set , ’ he said			0
‘ you get your opportunity , you try to take it and then you try to build on it			0
‘ there have been some top - quality centre backs for @entity4 , have n’t there ? at this moment , in the 23 there are four lads for that position and we are all looking to do as well as we can			2
’ at the age of 28 , this is @entity0 ’s first international tournament			1
he missed out on @entity98 , breaking his jaw in the last friendly before the event			0
in 2010 he was only an outsider for the squad and a potentially fatal blood clot kept him out of action in the run - up			2
now , it is @entity108 he must keep quiet			1
he has faced him only twice , once for @entity109 and once for @entity12 but the omens are good : @entity108 did n’t score in either of those games and was hauled off at half - time against @entity12			1
masterclass : @entity0 watched @entity79 star for @entity115 when he was a young fan @entity0 also has to contend with the @entity117 humidity and heat , a novel experience for all the players			1
yesterday @entity4 travelled to @entity121 and were confined to a gym session but today they will do light training in the @entity124			0
‘ we ’ve done all we possibly can , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s hard for @entity127 players			0
we ’re not used to this climate full - stop			2
but we ’ve been training and now playing in hot conditions			0
@entity131 was roasting for the @entity133 game			0
we ’ve done the heat chambers , we ’ve done the extra layers of clothing , so we ’ve done all we possibly can going into the game so we feel like we ’ve prepared the best we can			0
’ @entity0 says the training camp in @entity139 was the most uncomfortable : ‘ the first couple of times we trained with all the layers on it was tough			2
now we feel a lot better , so it ’s obviously worked			2
’ the true test will be tomorrow when @entity0 takes another step on his career progression — perhaps to establish himself as an iconic @entity4 defender			2
moving on up : @entity0 's @entity4 partnership with @entity23 , in action against @entity133 , has been criticised			2

@entity0 says he has learned a lot from @entity12 team - mate @entity5
the @entity76 star grew up watching @entity79 and @entity81
@entity0 faced with keeping @entity108 quiet
