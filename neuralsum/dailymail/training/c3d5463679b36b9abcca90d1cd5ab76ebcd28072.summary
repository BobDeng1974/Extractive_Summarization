change : @entity0 , pictured , said the benefits system has created welfare ' ghettoes ' conservative welfare reforms are part of an ' historic mission ' in the tradition of the fight to end slavery , @entity0 claimed today			1
the @entity10 said his determination to cut benefits and get people back to work is like the work of @entity16 who campaigned for the end of the slave trade and @entity20 , who enacted laws to protect women and children in @entity26 factories			1
he said middle - class families have been shocked by the reality of the ‘ twilight world ’ of @entity31 ’s welfare ‘ ghettos ’			1
and in a clear reference to the @entity36 documentary @entity34 , the @entity10 said that under @entity42 the ‘ middle - class majority were largely unaware of the true nature of life on some of our estates ’			2
‘ even now , for the most part , they remain out of sight – meaning people are shocked if and when they are confronted with the reality , ’ mr @entity0 added			1
signalling further welfare reforms that will be central to the @entity50 election manifesto , he also cautioned colleagues that ‘ casual disapproval of those on benefits is too easy ’ , pointing out that generations of politicians created the system that now traps claimants			2
in a major speech he said : ' reform , often overused , is in reality about transformation and life change , improving people ’s lives through the choices they make : a journey from dependence to independence			1
' @entity70 , that is part of our @entity74 ’s historic mission			2
just look at @entity16 and @entity20 : to put hope back where it has gone , to give people from chaotic lives security through hard work , helping families improve the quality of their own lives			1
the conservative party must not keep ' finger - wagging ' at people it disagrees with , @entity0 said today			1
he said he backed treasury minister @entity87 who this week warned the party would not woo female voters if it only talked about what it ' hates '			0
she said the party must not just say : ‘ we 're against this , we 're anti-that , we do n't like them , we do n't want them here , we do n't want them doing this			0
' she added : ‘ if we talk about what we hate all the time , we 're not talking about we like and what we want to do to help people who want to do well			2
mr @entity0 said he agreed with the remarks			1
he told @entity103 's @entity104 : ' i ’m in favour of talking about what we believe will improve life , not always finger - wagging , my point about welfare reform is it ’s positive life change			1
' it 's about getting people back into the mainstream , getting them back with that hope , that security			1
' ' @entity20 and @entity16 were people who faced a massive problem , a social problem , and saw only the need to change it , and embarked on that change against the vested interests and accepted wisdom of their age , and the results you can see were massive and transformational			2
' @entity34 , the @entity36 programme about the lives of benefit claimants on a @entity132 street , has provoked a fierce debate about the welfare state			0
mr @entity0 argued that @entity31 ‘ will only be great again if all in our society are part of our economic recovery and growth ’			1
yesterday , the @entity140 gave an unusual endorsement of the government ’s claim that its reforms – including a new £ 26,000 - a - year cap on benefits paid to any one household – are encouraging people to get work			1
with official figures showing employment at a record 30.15million after the biggest ever quarterly increase , the @entity140 said : ‘ a tightening in the eligibility requirements for some state benefits might also have led to an intensification of job search			1
’ speaking yesterday , mr @entity0 described the jobs figures as extraordinary			1
‘ i believe the welfare reforms this government has introduced – including , like the @entity140 mentioned , the tightening in the eligibility requirements for some state benefits – have contributed to this positive labour market story , ’ he said			2
‘ the long - term economic plan and the reforms we ’ve introduced are playing an important part in helping people off benefits and into work			1
in a speech in @entity173 today to mark the tenth anniversary of the @entity175 , the think tank he set up in opposition , mr @entity0 insisted that the @entity179 ‘ would have wanted to reform the welfare state even if we had no deficit ’			1
‘ as conservatives , we should hate the idea of people with unfulfilled potential languishing on welfare , ’ he said			2
‘ welfare reform is fundamentally about opportunity and life change , cutting the cost of social failure by transforming the life chances and outcomes of those on benefits – restoring fiscal stability , and restoring lives at the same time			2
’ controversial : the @entity36 programme @entity34 has provoked a fierce debate about the welfare state he believes millions were left locked in a life of dependency with ‘ no incentive to aspire for a better life ’			0
in the worst cases , the current system ‘ makes criminals out of those trapped in its clutches ’ as people choose to work in the ‘ shadow economy ’ because they fear benefits being withdrawn if they do so legitimately			1
under @entity42 , despite the economic boom and a 60 per cent increase in welfare spending , income inequality was the worst for a generation , mr @entity0 will add			1
‘ in neighbourhoods blighted by worklessness , where gangs were prevalent , debt and drugs the norm , families broken down , those living there had one thing in common ; they were for the most part dependent on the state for their daily needs , ’ he said			0
‘ for too long we let these problems be ghettoised as though they were a different country			0
’ welfare ' ghettoes ' : @entity238 patrol along @entity34 in @entity132 which was the focus of a @entity36 series @entity34 the welfare system became ‘ distorted ’ and was too often an entrapment rather than the safety net it was intended to be			0
‘ and at its very worst , the present system makes criminals out of those trapped in its clutches , ’ he said			0
‘ faced with losing up to 94 pence of every pound they earn because of how benefits are withdrawn , too many end up in the shadow economy or working cash in hand			1
‘ such behaviour can never be condoned , but it is a tragic state of affairs – and a mark of how far the current system has failed – that people should feel pushed into crime by having their aspirations to make a living penalised			0
‘ surely the system should deliver for people who want to work hard and play by the rules			1
’ the star of @entity34 rang @entity267 yesterday – and revealed that she was a @entity42 supporter			0
but ‘ @entity269 ’ , the self - styled ‘ mum ’ of the @entity132 street , pictured below , said she might be persuaded to back the @entity268			0
@entity269 – real name @entity269 – rang mr @entity267 ’s radio phone - in show to ask if he thought the documentary was a ‘ fair reflection ’ of people on benefits			1
the deputy prime minister admitted he had not watched the @entity36 series yet , but was committed to reforming welfare			0
after she told him she was ‘ very into politics ’ and always voted , the 42 - year - old told mr @entity267 : ‘ the last time i voted it was @entity42 because i was really annoyed when you went into coalition with the @entity179			1
' but hey - ho , you can win me back , mr @entity267			2
you can attempt to win me back			0
’ miss @entity269 later confirmed she had voted @entity42 in a local election			0
she goes by the name ‘ @entity269 ’ to distinguish her from a neighbour ‘ @entity296 ’ , whose real name is @entity295			0
yesterday she invited mr @entity267 , pictured below , to visit the residents of @entity34 after calling his show @entity299 on @entity300			2
‘ he would see a very clean street , ’ she said			0
‘ he would see people getting together , helping each other – not scrounging – and children at school			0
he would be very , very welcome			0
’ the series , set to run for another two weeks , saw 5.2million tuning in to monday ’s episode – but it has attracted more than 900 complaints after featuring scenes of shoplifting , jokes about fiddling benefits and growing cannabis			0
in one episode @entity314 is shown using her knowledge of the welfare system to help her neighbours , of which 75 per cent are said to be on benefits , to negotiate the government ’s new welfare tests			0
but she told the @entity268 leader the show ’s stars were ‘ shocked ’ by how they had been portrayed because they thought it was ‘ a documentary about community spirit ’			0
‘ i think it ’s very cleverly edited ’ , she added			0
mr @entity267 told miss @entity269 that ministers had to be ‘ hard headed ’ over welfare but warned against ‘ demonising ’ those on benefits			2
‘ receiving help from the generosity of others should n’t be a permanent way of life , and that the incentive to work is the most important one of all , ’ he said .			0
