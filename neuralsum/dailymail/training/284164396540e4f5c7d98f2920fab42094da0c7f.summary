schools across the country reported problems as @entity4 ’s flagship policy of giving free meals to all young children was introduced yesterday			1
the initiative was hailed a ‘ massive success ’ by the @entity8 , but even schools in mr @entity4 ’s @entity11 backyard admitted they could n’t cook their own hot meals			1
nine primaries in the city are bussing in meals cooked at neighbouring schools amid claims of a £ 400,000 shortfall in funds to upgrade kitchens			1
food for thought : @entity4 marking yesterday 's launch of his flagship meals policy at a school in @entity27 reports also emerged of canteen renovations over-running and deliveries of vital equipment such as tables and chairs failing to turn up			1
one school is offering hot meals on a ‘ first come , first served ’ basis while another even considered serving airline food supplied by local airports before opting for cold sandwiches			1
as they battle to implement the controversial £ 1billion policy , some schools are seating children for lunch in classrooms , music rooms or portakabins because they lack dining space			1
others are running three lunch sittings , restricting pupils ’ choice of food and asking seven - year - olds to serve drinks to younger pupils to take pressure off staff			2
@entity8 schools minister @entity58 declared the scheme , which involves offering free lunches to all four to seven - year - olds , a ‘ massive success ’ , while mr @entity4 insisted that giving children hot lunches can be better for their learning than extra @entity67 and maths lessons			1
the deputy prime minister said that ‘ giving a healthy hot meal at lunchtime is as , if not more , effective than many of the , say , literacy and numeracy initiatives which have been undertaken in the past in the classroom ’			2
teething problems ? schools in his own constituency could not cook hot food for pupils on the first day but critics claim the educational and health benefits touted by mr @entity4 have yet to be rigorously proven			1
they also claim councils and schools have been forced to raid other budgets to push the initiative through because the government failed to properly fund it			2
@entity90 , @entity91 ’s candidate against mr @entity4 in next year ’s national polls , said : ‘ in trying to get this policy in place before the general election , @entity4 has – as usual – over-promised and under - delivered			1
’ at @entity97 in @entity98 , @entity99 , hot meals are on a ‘ first come , first served basis ’ , with a cold packed lunch available as an alternative			1
in @entity104 , @entity103 will use its music room as a lunch area and a @entity107 has been installed at @entity108 to provide additional dining space			0
@entity110 said 12 primary schools – half of the town ’s total – will start the year by offering free cold packed lunches to some or all of its key stage one pupils rather than hot meals			1
@entity4 yesterday made a string of assertions about why his policy was destined to be an overwhelming success			1
here , @entity124 editor @entity123 sorts the claims from the reality			0
@entity127 : all the evidence , and this has been stress - tested and analysed , shows it has a dramatic effect on educational performance			0
reality : the @entity134 ’s own evaluation of pilots in @entity27 and @entity136 found a 1.9 percentage point increase in the proportion of pupils reaching the expected level in reading at @entity141 and a 2.2 percentage point increase for maths			2
critics says that , overall , this is barely statistically significant			0
for the highest performing children , there was no positive impact			0
crucially , the authors of the study admit the reasons for the improvement in overall performance were not clear			0
the pilots included a wider programme to promote healthy eating , such as providing advice to parents , which may also be responsible			0
@entity127 : it is good for children ’s health			0
reality : the evaluation stated there was no evidence the two - year pilot led to significant health benefits			0
for instance , it found ‘ there was no evidence of any change in children ’s @entity173 ’			0
researchers also found the pilot did not appear to significantly improve children ’s behaviour or absence rates from school			1
@entity127 : the policy is about having children share a healthy meal together at lunchtime rather than having children parcelled off , one group at one end of the room on free school meals and the other not			1
reality : @entity189 , of the @entity190 , said he could think of no examples in ‘ living memory ’ of schools segregating pupils who receive free school meals			1
@entity127 : i strongly dispute this idea that as we balance the books we do n’t do more to invest in a future in which every boy and girl irrespective of their birth gets the best possible chances in life			0
reality : the key point			0
firstly , with the deficit still running at more than £ 100billion , the government is not ‘ balancing the books ’			0
the money to pay for school meals amounts to £ 1billion of extra borrowing			1
many head teachers argue it could be spent far better elsewhere			0
coincidentally , councils warned last month of a £ 1bn shortfall in the funding they need to provide the school places needed to cope with @entity221 ’s rapidly growing population			2
the number of children in classes of more than 30 has increased by 200 per cent since 2010 – breaking the prime minister ’s promise to create ‘ small schools with smaller class sizes ’			2
@entity229 , of @entity230 , which supplies schools in the @entity232 , said : ‘ we are ready to launch the expanded free meals policy but it is likely there will be teething problems			1
‘ we are having to transport food into 16 schools which do not have kitchens , mostly in @entity241 and @entity242			2
’ in @entity244 , the @entity243 reported that 46 schools out of 201 are unable to provide hot meals			1
in @entity248 , the figure was 45 out of 159			0
@entity249 , contracts manager for @entity250 , said she had been ‘ almost reduced to tears … by builders not meeting agreed deadlines and not apparently caring ’			0
@entity254 , a catering manager for five schools in @entity256 , tweeted that one school was refusing to offer free meals at all ‘ until they get their kitchen in october ’			1
@entity189 , general secretary of the @entity190 , said : ‘ there will be some schools that will be providing a cold meal this term while they wait for the building work to finish off			0
‘ the logistics of getting large numbers of children through , how you schedule the timings of lunch and whether you ’ve got kids eating in their classrooms or not – all that will be quite difficult for schools			0
they ’ll manage it but it ’ll put a huge burden on them			0
’ some £ 1billion has been earmarked over two years to cover the cost of meals , while £ 150million has been spent upgrading kitchens , with an additional £ 22.5million going to smaller schools			2
the @entity134 said only 239 out of 16,500 schools would be providing a cold meal instead of a hot one this week			2
mr @entity58 said : ‘ i am absolutely delighted that our statistics , which come from local authorities and schools , show that 98.5 per cent of schools across the country – 16,500 schools – are delivering a hot meal option from the start of term			2
’ it was a ‘ massive success ’ , he said .			0
