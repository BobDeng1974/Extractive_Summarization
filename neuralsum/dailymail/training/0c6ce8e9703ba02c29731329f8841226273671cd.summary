by @entity0 during my years as a conservationist , i have witnessed many shocking sights : elephants hacked to death for their ivory ; rhinos butchered for the supposed healing properties of their horns ; and tigers ensnared in vicious traps so that their body parts can be harvested as a cure for impotence in parts of @entity17 and @entity18			1
i thought i ’d seen just about every example of man ’s inhumanity to his fellow creatures			0
but even i was shocked by the news that @entity24 has shot dead a perfectly healthy young giraffe named @entity26			1
not only shot him , but dissected his corpse in front of an audience of zoo visitors , including many young children			0
in a final insult , his dismembered body was fed to its resident pride of lions			2
@entity26 the giraffe was killed at @entity24 yesterday after he was deemed ' surplus to requirements ' keepers shot the infant with a bolt gun before dissecting his body in front of a crowd including children this came soon after reports that @entity49 , one of the @entity51 ’s most - visited safari parks , had killed six of its lions , including a lioness and four of her cubs , apparently because of overcrowding in the enclosures			1
employees were said to have wept when they heard what had happened to their beloved animals when there was no obvious reason for them to have been killed			1
before the cull was reported at the weekend , no explanation had been given for the lions ’ absence when @entity49 reopened after a long winter break			1
there was a sense of wanting to keep the cull quiet			0
yet @entity24 seems almost to have revelled in the publicity			1
after @entity26 had been given a last meal of rye bread , then shot with a bolt gun , the three - hour spectacle of his rather public dissection began			1
thousands more watched via the internet			0
the zoo ’s spokesman @entity80 declared that he was ‘ proud ’ the children had been given an unrivalled opportunity to gain ‘ huge understanding of the anatomy of a giraffe ’			2
meanwhile , the zoo ’s scientific director , @entity87 , defended the execution , claiming that @entity26 had been ‘ surplus to requirements ’			1
the killing took place despite and offer from @entity94 to take the young male in after the autopsy @entity26 was fed to the lions , with staff calling the procedure part of the ' circle of life ' by this , he meant @entity26 had been declared too closely related genetically to the other giraffes in its breeding programme			1
to prevent inbreeding , it had been told by the @entity107 ( @entity107 ) that if it kept him , there was a danger of inbreeding and so poor @entity26 had to go			2
this was all presented as a regrettable , but ethical necessity			0
the decision to turn this elegant animal into cat food was justified as part of the ‘ cycle of nature ’			0
yes , it is true that lions eat giraffes in the wild and we should n’t shy away from that			2
but a bolt - gun to the head in a zoo is very far from nature			0
@entity26 ’s dismemberment on a cold concrete floor at @entity24 is all the more hard to bear since his death could have been entirely avoidable			1
the zoo had apparently ruled out castration because it requires sedation , a high - risk procedure for giraffes as they risk breaking their necks when they drop down unconscious			0
neither , according to the zoo , was contraception possible for the females with whom @entity26 was likely to come into contact , since this can damage a female giraffe ’s internal organs			1
@entity26 ’s fate seemed sealed			2
then , at the very last minute , an offer to save him was made by the @entity94 , which has a state - of - the - art giraffe house and capacity for an extra male			2
this was rejected by @entity87 , who argued that any such space should be reserved for a ‘ genetically more important ’ giraffe			0
that @entity87 should reject their offer left @entity26 ’s would - be saviours understandably ‘ saddened ’ and presumably mystified — as was the rest of the world			2
why did the zoo go ahead with the slaughter regardless ? and what were the parents of those children taken to watch the subsequent autopsy thinking ? do children really need to see a giraffe ’s insides to appreciate what a miracle of natural engineering such a creature represents ? the only lesson i can imagine most children taking away from such an experience is that zoo keepers are only one step away from butchers			0
we are so very fond of animals in this country that many of us will find ourselves asking why @entity26 had to die in the first place			1
as the cull of lions at @entity49 suggests , this is a problem that faces zoos all over the world			1
@entity192 , president of the @entity193 , describes this as the ‘ dirty secret ’ of many zoos and wildlife parks			0
last month , @entity26 the giraffe was killed , chopped up and fed to lions at @entity24 in @entity200 indeed , at the @entity24 there have been previous culls of bears , tigers and zebras , according to one @entity200 newspaper			1
put simply , it is that their breeding programmes are often all too effective			2
as @entity49 has admitted , a recent increase in pregnancies had led to a 40 per cent increase in the number of cubs			1
with all that youthful energy , keepers noticed ‘ excessive violent behaviour ’ within their enclosure			0
in 2011 , a whistle - blower at @entity220 on @entity221 released images of carcases of animals left to rot by bins after being shot			0
there is no suggestion that @entity49 is similarly irresponsible , but there is no escaping the fact that , like @entity24 and all zoos , it sometimes breeds more of a particular species than it can realistically keep			1
in blaming a ‘ recent increase in pregnancies ’ , @entity49 seem almost to imply that circumstances were beyond their control , but theirs is a strictly controlled population of lions , so who else but the humans in charge can be blamed for any increase in their lion population ? we must also question why zoos are breeding such animals in the first place			1
there is no question that they are often involved in invaluable conservation work			0
for example , @entity255 ’s @entity254 has been successful in preserving the rare and beautiful @entity258 deer , which were virtually extinct in their native @entity17			0
breeding programmes which produce too many offspring are to blame for extra culls ( @entity26 circled ) the news of @entity26 ' demise came just a day after it was revealed a lioness and four of her cubs were put down at @entity49 ( pictured are lions and cubs from the same pride ) but when it comes to animals such as lions , what is the point of breeding them when there is no realistic chance they can ever be released back into the wild because they are so used to being fed by their human keepers that they would be unable to fend for themselves ? the same is true of elephants			1
there are seven specimens of this magnificent species at @entity24 , which boasts that its @entity292 elephants are kept in a grand enclosure and house designed by the renowned architect @entity295			2
they say the architecture provides ‘ these magnificent animals with a stimulating environment ’			0
i have never been to @entity24 , but it apparently occupies a site of only 27 acres and , since elephants range huge distances — sometimes hundreds of miles — in the wild , it is clearly anything but a natural environment for them			2
those who defend zoos argue that they make such animals accessible to people who might otherwise never get to see them			0
but is our natural human desire to gawk really sufficient reason to imprison them in habitats and conditions so far from those in which they should live out their lives ? and then to cut them into pieces in front of small children ? i will never forget the experience of taking my daughter to @entity332 when she was eight years old			0
the visit was swiftly cut short when she began crying at the sight of the animals in their cages			0
i can only imagine her trauma had she witnessed the recent events in @entity24 and at @entity49			1
the @entity341 , built in the ground of @entity49 , @entity343 ( pictured ) , said a ' population increase ' which lead a rise in violent behaviour was behind the decision to put the animals down these travesties of all that is natural are even more unfortunate given that @entity350 is about to host an international summit on conserving endangered species , due to start this thursday			1
it is a vital opportunity to address the illegal trade in wildlife parts , which is worth an estimated £ 12 billion a year			0
the fate of @entity26 and the @entity49 lions reminds us that we must also look to the welfare of those species supposedly being protected in zoos much closer to home			1
animals are not here for our entertainment , to be made into trinkets or to be killed on a whim to ‘ educate ’ a group of schoolchildren			2
surely we should be teaching children that animals are worth more alive than dead			0
otherwise what hope is there for the future of the species that are rapidly disappearing from our planet			0
@entity0 is chairman of @entity378 , a charity that campaigns for the conservation and welfare of @entity292 elephants and all animals that share their habitat .			1

@entity26 the giraffe was killed at @entity24 yesterday
it was also revealed a lioness and her cubs were put down at @entity49
@entity0 says success in breeding animals can lead to culls
here he asks : why are we breeding animals like lions in the first place ?
