by @entity0 published : 04:28 est , 13 december 2012 updated : 09:16 est , 14 december 2012 astronomers peering through the @entity2 have found galaxies so ancient they describe them as ' baby pictures of the @entity6 '			1
the seven galaxies pictured formed relatively shortly after the dawn of time 13.7billion years ago and are the and are the most primitive and distant ever seen			1
one of the objects may be the oldest galaxy yet found , dating back to a time when the universe was just 380 million years old , a fraction of its current age			1
the discovery of galaxies dating back to the universe 's early years should help scientists figure out what happened after the @entity6 's ' dark ages '			1
this was a period of time about 200million years after the @entity39 explosion when cooling clouds of hydrogen , clumped together by gravity , began to ignite , triggering the first generation of stars			1
' it was a very important moment in cosmic history , ' said astronomer @entity47 of the @entity48 ( @entity48 ) in @entity49			0
scientists do not know exactly when this ' cosmic dawn ' occurred and whether it was a single , dramatic event that caused all the galaxies to form their first stars , or whether it happened more gradually over millions of years			1
the new observations span a period between 350 million and 600 million years after the @entity39 and represent the first reliable census of galaxies at such an early time in cosmic history , the @entity48 team says			2
the astronomers found that the number of galaxies steadily increased as time went on , supporting the idea that the first galaxies did n’t form in a sudden burst but gradually assembled their stars			1
furthest look achieved yet : the new galaxies are shown at the top of the picture , and their locations are pinpointed in the main image because it takes light billions of years to travel such vast distances , astronomical images show how the universe looked during the period , billions of years ago , when that light first embarked on its journey			2
the farther away astronomers peer into space , the further back in time they are looking			2
the latest study explores the deepest reaches of the cosmos - and therefore the most distant past - that has ever been studied with @entity2			2
' we ’ve made the longest exposure that @entity2 has ever taken , capturing some of the faintest and most distant galaxies , ' says @entity47 , astronomy professor at @entity48 and the first author of the paper			0
' the added depth and our carefully designed observing strategy have been the key features of our campaign to reliably probe this early period of cosmic history			0
' the results are the first from a new @entity2 survey that focused on a small patch of sky known as the @entity16 ( @entity104 ) , which was first studied nine years ago			2
this timeline shows the development of the galaxies in our universe since the @entity39 13.7billion years ago : because it takes light billions of years to travel vast distances , the farther away astronomers peer into space , the further back in time they are looking the astronomers used @entity2 ’s @entity116 ( @entity116 ) to observe the @entity104 in near - infrared light over a period of six weeks during august and september 2012			1
to determine the distances to these galaxies , the team measured their colours using four filters that allow @entity2 to capture near - infrared light at specific wavelengths			0
pushed to its limit : the observations made by the @entity2 ( pictured ) will be expanded on by the planned @entity128 ' we employed a filter that has not been used in deep imaging before , and undertook much deeper exposures in some filters than in earlier work , in order to convincingly reject the possibility that some of our galaxies might be foreground objects , ' said team member @entity140 of the @entity142 's @entity141			1
the filters allowed the astronomers to measure the light that was absorbed by neutral hydrogen , which filled the universe beginning about 400,000 years after the @entity39			2
as stars and galaxies started to form roughly 200million years after the @entity39 they bathed the cosmos with ultraviolet light , which ionised the neutral hydrogen by stripping an electron from each hydrogen atom			1
this so - called ' epoch of reionisation ' lasted until the universe was about a billion years old			2
if everything in the universe were stationary , astronomers would see that only a specific wavelength of light was absorbed by neutral hydrogen			0
but the universe is expanding , and this stretches the wavelengths of light coming from galaxies			0
the amount that the light is stretched - called the redshift - depends on distance : the farther away a galaxy is , the greater the redshift			2
launched from the @entity169 in 1990 , the @entity2 sits 353 miles above the surface of the @entity171 peering into the cosmos with a view uninhibited by interference from our atmosphere			2
shifting pockets of air distort light from space — that 's why stars seem to twinkle when viewed from the ground			1
furthermore , the atmosphere blocks some wavelengths of light partially or entirely , making space the only place where it is possible to get a truly clear and comprehensive view of the universe			0
in its first 15 years , the telescope recorded over 700,000 images and helped to expand our understanding of star birth , star death , galaxy evolution , and has helped move black holes from theory to fact			1
@entity2 's large mirror collects light from celestial objects and directs it to the telescope 's instruments , the astronomer ’s eyes to the universe			1
@entity2 's current instruments are the @entity116 ( @entity116 ) , @entity209 ( @entity209 ) , @entity210 ( @entity210 ) , @entity211 ( @entity211 ) , @entity212 ( @entity212 ) , and @entity213 ( @entity213 )			0
it is set to be replaced by the @entity128 , due for launch in 2018 , which will orbit a million miles from @entity171			0
it is hoped that the infrared - optimised @entity215 will find the first galaxies that formed in the early @entity6 , connecting the @entity39 to our own @entity217			1
as a result of this cosmic expansion , astronomers observe that the absorption of light by neutral hydrogen occurs at longer wavelengths for more distant galaxies			0
the filters enabled the researchers to determine at which wavelength the light was absorbed ; this revealed the distance to the galaxy - and therefore the period in cosmic history when it is being formed			1
using this technique to penetrate further and further back in time , the team found a steadily decreasing number of galaxies			1
' our data confirms that reionisation is a drawn - out process occurring over several hundred million years with galaxies slowly building up their stars and chemical elements , ' said co-author @entity247 of the @entity248 in @entity249			1
' there was n’t a single dramatic moment when galaxies formed ; it ’s a gradual process			0
' the new observations - which pushed @entity2 to its technical limits - hint at what is to come with next - generation infrared space telescopes , the researchers say			0
to probe even further back in time to see ever more primitive galaxies , astronomers will need to observe in wavelengths longer than those that can be detected by @entity2			0
that ’s because cosmic expansion has stretched the light from the most distant galaxies so much that they glow predominantly in the infrared			0
the upcoming @entity128 , slated for launch in a few years , will target those galaxies			0
' although we may have reached back as far as @entity2 will see , @entity2 has , in a sense , set the stage for @entity215 , ' says team member @entity275 of the @entity276 in @entity277			0
' our work indicates there is a rich field of even earlier galaxies that @entity215 will be able to study			0
' the research appears in the @entity283 .			0

one of the objects may be the oldest galaxy yet found , dating back to when the cosmos was just *380million* years old
discoveries should help scientists figure out what was going on during the @entity6 's ' dark ages ' before stars formed
