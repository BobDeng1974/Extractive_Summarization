he said she had done so on a number of occasions			0
on one she took him from his care home to attend a court hearing			1
on another she took him to @entity87 to talk to a solicitor			0
the judge recorded that she also gave her father a wooden cross ‘ to prevent the evil in the home from hurting him ’			2
miss @entity24 also ‘ produced and distributed a leaflet prior to and during the final hearing giving details of the case , containing a photograph of her father and other information so as to identify him and that is in breach of @entity25 rules			1

i believe the judges have broken the rules of their own courts , but nobody is doing anything about it			0

’ councillor @entity243 , @entity73 city council cabinet member for social services , said : ‘ this is clearly an extreme case , but one that the @entity25 supported the council on			2
it was the court ’s decision to issue a custodial sentence to @entity173			0
‘ our chief concern was always centred around the welfare of her father , who was suffering from a deteriorating condition and required 24 - hour supervision in a stable environment			0
‘ this was a decision reached by medical consultants , geriatricians , social workers , community psychiatric nurses , dieticians , consultant health and nursing professionals and others who were involved in assessing his needs			0
’ she added : ‘ this decision was also ratified by the @entity25 , which carried out its own independent assessment of his needs			2
