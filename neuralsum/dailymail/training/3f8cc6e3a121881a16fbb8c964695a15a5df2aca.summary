over- 50s hold almost half of physical wealth , figures from @entity3 while many @entity8 are still recovering from the financial crisis , the over- 50s are enjoying record levels of wealth , figures show			1
new analysis found older people now enjoy a greater proportion of everything from property wealth to stocks and shares than they did in 2008			2
saga , which commissioned the study , said that over- 50s had weathered the recession by taking a ‘ prudent approach ’ to life and had saved , spent and invested carefully			1
they have also benefited from booming house prices , with the over- 50s owning the majority of property in the @entity8			1
a report by the @entity31 found the over- 50s now hold over two - thirds of all household wealth			2
this includes property , physical assets such as cars , furniture , art and televisions , financial wealth such as stocks , bonds and trusts , and pension wealth			1
the over- 50s hold almost half of physical wealth , three - quarters of financial wealth and two - thirds of property wealth			1
saga said it should ‘ come as no surprise that many people who have worked , saved and invested over a number of years have built significant wealth ’			0
they said the rise in the number of older workers also meant increased the riches of the over- 50s			2
@entity64 , at @entity53 , said : ‘ the proportion of wealth held by the over 50s has gone up since the start of the financial crisis predominantly through the careful management of their finances and changes to their retirement age			0
‘ we now have more than a million over 65s who are remaining in work so they can earn , spend and save more than previous generations would have done			0
‘ this is in part due to the desire for active older people to want to work longer , but also due to low interest rates which have encouraged many to stay in the workforce			0
’ he added : ‘ contrary to the rhetoric of the pinch enthusiasts , the @entity53 generations have not commandeered an undue share of wealth in some conspiracy against the young , but have instead built it through the dint of their hard work			0
‘ of course , some of this wealth has been built through house price inflation , and the fact that many older homeowners have generally paid off a much larger proportion of their mortgage , however many plan to use this accumulated wealth to support or pass onto their families			0
’ in addition to cash , older people have household wealth assets such as cars , furniture , art , stocks , bonds and trusts			1

older people survived the *slump* by taking a ‘ prudent approach ’ to life
over- 50s own majority of property in @entity8 and almost half of physical wealth
wealth includes assets like cars , furniture , art , stocks , bonds and trusts
