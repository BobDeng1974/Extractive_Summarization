hidden in a vault in @entity2 , it has been one of the most highly - anticipated albums in music history			1
and tonight , after six years , the @entity5 finally opened the handcrafted silver box that holds their unheard record @entity5 - before sealing it away once more			1
in an attempt to break free from the @entity14 and @entity15 era of freely - shared music , rap 's most influential collective is selling the 31 - track double lp to one bidder for millions of dollars			1
after a private online - only sale this month through art dealers @entity21 - which employs @entity23 's @entity22 - the buyer can not share the album for at least 88 years			1
@entity25 was there with the group 's de facto leader @entity27 , producer @entity29 , a small group of prospective buyers and half a dozen selected fans in @entity33 , @entity34 , for the first and last time any of the album would be played before the year 2103			1
it has been six years in the making the record comes in a silver , jeweled box with a specially - designed wax seal and a leather - bound book the box : it was displayed for potential buyers who are expected to pay millions to obtain the sole incarnation the @entity52 - born group revived the @entity53 as an epicenter for hip hop in the early 1990s confirming the rumors that she would make a guest appearance , @entity57 's voice bellowed out during the 13 - minute extract			1
and though it was n't played , @entity25 understands it to be true that @entity63 players also make a cameo appearance			1
typical of the group 's first record @entity65 , it features styles that shook the music scene in 1994 - soul samples , clips of dialogue from movies , and fierce rapping over sound effects of rain and thunder			1
reiterating its own grandeur , there are regular skits and pieces of dialogue that say , ' this has never been done before			0
' all of the @entity52 clan 's eight living members appear on it - but had no idea what they were recording when they laid down their parts			0
the record casing was handcrafted from silver and wood by artists in @entity95 , with a seal designed and printed by wax - smiths in @entity98			2
' this has never been done before , ' @entity27 told @entity25 after playing the record			1
' music is just handed out now , the industry is in crisis			0
people feel like they deserve to have it for free			0
this is art. you can take a picture of the @entity109 but that 's not art. ' the same with this : you can never reproduce it - this is the final thing			0
' the pre-sale event played up to the idea			0
those invited were subjected to airport - style security checks , and electronic devices were confiscated			0
in a dark room , buyers spoke to auctioneers as light symphony music played			2
the nickel silver and jeweled case with black cow leather lining was sat on a podium under spotlight , with two bodyguards standing either side			0
while some were fans , others were advisers who hailed from as far as @entity134 to inspect the ' artwork '			0
one adviser for a @entity138 collector , who wished to remain anonymous , told @entity25 collectors are clamouring to get their hands on the record and its silver box - whether they like @entity5 or not			1
the box comes inside a cedar wood treasure chest covered with black cow leather and light beige velvet lining			0
inside , is a cinematic - style record , plus a leather - bound 174 - page manuscript printed on gilded @entity151 parchment with lyrics , credits , tales about the recording			2
the adviser said : ' someone said it would be worth $ 1 million			0
this is something completely different ; completely new			0
i do n't think i could put a price on it			0
' the concept has not been seen before - and from the biggest rap collective in history ... it is huge			0
' the @entity5 formed in the early 1990s , reviving the @entity53 's reputation as an epicenter for hip hop			2
@entity27 - pronounced ' rizza ' - drew together nine mcs , including his own cousins who adopted the pseudonyms @entity175 and @entity176			1
the remaining slots were filled by @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 , and @entity183			0
ambition : @entity27 , n√© @entity27 , wants the long - awaited album to be treated like a work of art unlike their other albums , it has not been produced by the group 's de facto leader @entity27 ( pictured ) but by his apprentice , @entity95 rapper and producer @entity195 the new album pays homage to the @entity5 's history and meteoric rise to dominate the record industry with industry domination in their sights , @entity27 saw that each member of the @entity5 was signed with different production companies , while maintaining their loyalty as a group			1
their first album , 36 chambers , was hailed as unprecedented , with samples from soul music and kung fu movies			2
spanning 128 minutes , the stories and rhymes were largely recorded in @entity52 , @entity34 , and hark back to their original mid- 90s lyrics about the @entity218			2
it features all eight of the original members plus some affiliate rappers			0
and as for @entity57 's cameo appearance , @entity27 said : ' did nobody ever have a crush on @entity57 ? she 's the ultimate			1
ai n't nobody like @entity57			2
' unlike their other albums , it has not been produced by the group 's de facto leader @entity27 but by his apprentice , @entity95 rapper and producer @entity233 - a @entity5 fan who visited the group 's @entity34 office five times until they took him on			1
@entity29 explains he and @entity27 were already developing the concept of a record charting the @entity5 's history when the music industry changed completely			1
@entity5 has been stored in a handmade silver and nickel box embossed with the @entity5 's @entity218 symbol and a decorative design by @entity247 , a @entity23 - @entity95 artist collectively , the group has produced seven albums - sometimes within months of each other within five years singles plummeted to the price of $ 0.99 , and artists were streaming their work for free			1
simultaneously , @entity29 was chairing an art festival in @entity95 , where he saw three tent poles bought for thousands of dollars			2
' that [ was ] the first time i asked myself : " why and how are these artists valued at such a price ? " people like @entity262 or @entity263 or @entity27 are geniuses in what they do , and their music is valued at 99 cents			1
' no disrespect to @entity268 , @entity269 , @entity270 , or any other artists , but if you walk down the streets and ask people randomly , " do you know @entity270 ? do you know @entity269 ? " they 'll say " who ? " if you say , " do you know dr. @entity262 ? do you know @entity263 ? , " they 'll say " yeah			0
" ' the album , he says , pays homage to the @entity5 's history and meteoric rise to dominate the record industry			1
the group became known for their business genius as they created a collective but each had their own solo contracts , thereby dominating the recording industry 36 @entity291 : this was the collective 's debut album which revolutionized the hip hop scene and despite years of disputes erupting between the clan 's members , @entity27 insists that there was ' no tension ' when he informed his brethren he had been working on a secret album , adding ' the eight members , excluding myself , are the most talented mcs i have ever encountered			1
they are true artists because they are n't taught			0
you ca n't teach art. ' speaking later with genius executive editor @entity309 , @entity27 described his ambitions : ' maybe @entity311 will just buy it and put it on one of his planes and send it to another planet			2
that 'd be dope ! ' however , @entity29 conceded , the fact that the buyer can not commercialize it means that they could distribute it for free			0
' i hope they do n't , ' @entity27 said			2
' this is unique and something only has value if it is rare			0
