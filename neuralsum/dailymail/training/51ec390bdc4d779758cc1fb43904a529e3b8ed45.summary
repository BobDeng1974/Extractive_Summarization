by @entity0 published : 19:58 est , 9 september 2012 updated : 10:09 est , 10 september 2012 a giant ' balloon of magma ' is inflating under the volcanic @entity5 island of @entity6 , a study has warned			1
the balloon is so big it has forced the island upwards by 14cm between january 2011 and april this year			0
it has also triggered a series of small earthquakes , the first seismic activity in 25 years - raising fears that the volcano could erupt for the first time since 1950			1
volcanic crater on @entity17 , @entity6 , @entity5			2
the chamber of molten rock beneath @entity6 's volcano expanded 10 to 20 million cubic metres the chamber of molten rock beneath the volcano has expanded 10 to 20 million cubic metres - up to 15 times the size of @entity26 's @entity25 since january 2011 , according to a survey conducted by a team led by @entity30 scientists			1
the results come from an expedition , funded by the @entity34 's @entity33 , which used satellite radar images and @entity37 receivers ( gps ) that can detect movements of the @entity40 's surface of just a few millimetres			0
the findings are helping scientists to understand more about the inner workings of the volcano which had its last major explosive eruption 3,600 years ago , one of history 's largest ever volcanic eruptions , which buried the islands of @entity6 under metres of pumice			1
over the past year and a half , parts of @entity6 have risen by 14 cm , such as the @entity17 islands in the centre the geological record of the island over the past million years reveals an extensive history of eruptions , with the most recent occurring in 1950			1
but despite being dormant for over half a century , satellites have detected the slight movements			0
scientists say that the movements do not mean an eruption is about to happen			0
the rate of earthquake activity has dropped off in the past few months			0
@entity6 is an island in the southern @entity66 , about 120 miles south east of the @entity5 mainland			2
it is the largest island of a small , circular archipelago which bears the same name and is the remnant of a volcanic caldera			2
@entity6 , @entity5 , an island in the southern @entity66 , about 120 miles south east of the @entity5 mainland			0
it is the largest island of a small , circular archipelago which bears the same name in january 2011 , a series of small earthquakes began beneath the islands of @entity6			1
most were so small they could only be detected with sensitive seismometers but it was the first sign of activity beneath the volcano to be detected for 25 years			1
following the earthquakes @entity85 , an @entity86 student , spotted signs of movement of the @entity40 's surface on @entity6 in satellite radar images			1
@entity30 undergraduate students then helped researchers complete a new survey of the island			0
ms @entity85 , of @entity30 's @entity95 and an author of the paper , said : ' during my field visits to @entity6 in 2011 , it became apparent that many of the locals were aware of a change in the behaviour of their volcano			2
' the tour guides , who visit the volcano several times a day , would update me on changes in the amount of strong smelling gas being released from the summit , or changes in the colour of the water in some of the bays around the islands			0
' on one particular day in april 2011 , two guides told me they had felt an earthquake while they were on the volcano and that the motion of the ground had actually made them jump			0
@entity6 , in the south @entity66 , was formed by a volcanic explosion thought to have taken place in the second millennium bc ' locals working in restaurants on the main island of @entity6 became aware of the increase in earthquake activity due to the vibration and clinking of glasses in their bars			1
' dr @entity136 , of @entity137 , also an author of the paper , said : ' people were obviously aware that something was happening to the volcano , but it was n't until we saw the changes in the gps , and the uplift on the radar images that we really knew that molten rock was being injected at such a shallow level beneath the volcano			1
' many volcanologists study the rocks produced by old eruptions to understand what happened in the past , so it 's exciting to use cutting - edge satellite technology to link that to what 's going on in the volcanic plumbing system right now			2
' professor @entity158 , of @entity30 's @entity95 , another author of the paper , said : ' for me , the challenge of this project is to understand how the information on how the volcano is behaving right now can be squared with what we thought we knew about the volcano , based on the studies of both recent and ancient eruptions			0
' there are very few volcanoes where we have such detailed information about their past history			0
' the team calculate that the amount of molten rock that has arrived beneath @entity6 in the past year is the equivalent of about 10 to 20 years growth of the volcano			1
the findings were published in the journal @entity184 .			0

@entity186 is site of one of history 's largest volcanic eruptions 3,600 years ago , which buried the islands of @entity6 under metres of pumice
@entity193 now showing signs of *unrest* and first seismic activity in 25 years
molten rock chamber expanded up to 15 times size of @entity26 's @entity25 in just over a year
