by @entity1 reporter bad news , @entity3 : the selfie is officially played out thanks to an entrepreneur in @entity7 who has just raised the bar for ego - inflating , self - photography			1
behold : the ' dronie ' is upon us			2
@entity14 , the founder of the photography accessory store @entity15 , has been experimenting with taking the ultimate aerial self - portraits for months - and it appears he 's successfully snapped the first ' dronie			1
' ' @entity19 ' : internet entrepreneur @entity14 ( left ) has officially raised the bar for selfies @entity14 and @entity23 reporter @entity22 ( left ) took the drone to @entity25 in @entity7 to take the world 's first ' dronie ' @entity28 : the queen of selfies , @entity29 , has become somewhat infamous for her shameless use of selfies she shares on social media @entity14 and @entity23 technology business columnist @entity22 last week took a @entity35 drone with a remote controlled camera attached to it to @entity25 in @entity7 to attempt the first documented ' dronie			1
' apparently , it is tougher than it looks			0
' the first thing i learned during my flight lesson is that mr. @entity14 has a lot more patience than i do , ' @entity22 wrote in his @entity23 column on wednesday			1
' instead of starting the drone and just taking off immediately , we started it , set it on the ground , and waited			2
nice view : the drone is able to capture panoramic views from a fairly high altitude - in addition to snapping dronies , of course ' the trick with the drones that have gps built - in is to ensure that it has activated before flying — in the case of the @entity35 drones , a series of lights under the propellers flash green when it is ready to go			0
once this is done , the drone knows where you are , where it is , and if it ’s windy , it will stay in place rather than float away			0
if it gets lost , it will now know where it started its trip and return			0
' when it was finally time to take off i had to tell my inner 12 - year - old to slow down and not attempt to go as far away as i possibly could			0
' ultimate dronie : that speck in the middle of the shot is @entity14 and @entity22 as they take the world 's first ' dronie ' according to @entity22 , once the drone was ready for flight , it hovered in front of the group for about 10 seconds , at which point @entity14 told everyone to smile			1
@entity14 then ' shot the controls forward and up and zoomed the drone backwards into the sky , shooting it about 800 feet away from us			2
while this took a few takes to get right , the result , as you can see in the video above , is breathtaking			0
