by @entity0 this tiny pygmy owl had a hoot as it dived into snow , leaving just its head and wings poking out			1
as part of the smallest species in @entity11 the owl , which measured about 7in from tip to tail , used its lightning - speed reactions to catch a vole hidden in the deep bank in @entity15 , @entity16 - emerging with the creature after just 15 seconds			1
the sequence was captured by photographer @entity19 , 48 , as part of a new book about the birds			2
' first its head was under the snow when it was looking for vole and it was almost completely covered			0
' the whole hunting sequence lasted 15 seconds and the owl looked very satisfied when it flew off with a vole			0
' i was thrilled to witness and capture this scene on camera			0
' mr @entity19 's photographs have depicted owls hunting , nesting and even apparently giving the photographer a cheeky wink			1
the book by @entity19 and his friend @entity50 focuses on owls			1
here a @entity53 owl hunts in the snow owl you doing ? this female @entity57 's owl poked its head out from a tree and appeared to give a wink hunters : the creatures , including this barn owl , will look for anywhere sheltered to nest during the winter majestic : the book covers @entity67 and @entity68			2
here a @entity70 owl watches the sun rise in @entity72 barn owls , such as this one in @entity72 , listen for the sound of their prey scuttling along the ground in one extraordinary photo , a female @entity57 's owl stared straight at the camera lens with one eye closed as she stared out through a gap in a tree trunk			2
mr @entity19 achieved the shots by putting up hundreds of nesting boxes in the forests of his native @entity16 and staking them out until the birds arrived			1
the photos are part of the new book @entity90 he said : ' these nest boxes are definitely beneficial for the owls in commercially harvested forests , where there are n’t many natural woodpecker holes			0
' @entity98 ’s owls appreciate the nest boxes and other owl species nesting in my boxes include @entity104 owls , @entity106 owls , @entity53 owls and @entity109 owls			1
' it is easy to check if the nest box is occupied			0
you just need to give the tree trunk a little scratch and their head will pop out immediately			0
' mr @entity19 ’s photographs feature in his new book @entity90 , which has just been published with photographer and friend @entity50			1
of the ' winking ' photo , he said : ' this female stayed at the hole for couple of minutes and , while i was slowly walking around and looking for different angles , i saw it suddenly winking its eye			0
it looked really funny ! ' it was like the owl was telling me : " thank you for putting up this nest box for me "			0

they put up hundreds of nesting boxes to *attract* owls into the forest
