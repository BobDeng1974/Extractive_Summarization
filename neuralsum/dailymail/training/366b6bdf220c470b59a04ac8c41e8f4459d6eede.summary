for @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 , it appears they have particularly enjoyed @entity1 's return to the first - team fold			1
@entity1 uploaded a video on @entity20 and @entity14 dancing in the changing rooms to ' blessings ' by @entity23 featuring @entity24 and @entity25 , before the camera cuts to the striker himself doing a jig reminiscent of his renowned scoring celebration			1

but @entity52 refused to be drawn on whether @entity1 would play form the beginning			0
' i think every player wants to play , not just @entity1 , ' he said			0
' he is coming along very well			0
it is not that he wo n't start , we just need to analyse that over the next couple of days			0

@entity52 will also have to decide whether to bring @entity15 back into the squad on saturday , as the @entity91 international did not even make the bench in midweek			0
@entity14 , a pacy winger with similar skills to @entity13 , is held in high regard at @entity2 and was recalled from his loan at @entity96 as @entity52 felt he could contribute to @entity5 's top - four challenge			1
but it is @entity87 who @entity62 will hope to keep quiet in saturday 's late kick - off at @entity74			0
