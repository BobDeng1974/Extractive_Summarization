@entity7 , 24 , from @entity8 , west @entity9 , gave birth in august 2011 but complained to her husband of shortness of breath and chest pains			1
she was taken to @entity22 following a collapse however , the dvt was not spotted and she was sent home following more tests , the inquest was told			2
although she had been given an electrocardiagram ( @entity34 ) by paramedics , which showed tachycardia - an abnormally fast heartbeat which can be linked to a caesarean - before she was taken to the hospital , her doctor said she was never told about the condition			1
dr @entity41 said she was not told about the results of the @entity34 carried out by the paramedics - which she admitted at the inquest were abnormal			2
she added if she had been told of the suggestion of tachycardia she would have asked for another @entity34 to be done at the hospital			1
she said : ' mrs @entity7 spoke normally without shortness of breath			1
' i did n't request an ecg because i did n't hear of any symptoms			0
mrs @entity7 was found to have tachycardia - an abnormally fast heartbeat - by paramedics but a doctor at the hospital says she was not made aware of it ' the observations ( about the patient ) were on a paper towel when i first assessed her as the notes had n't been made up yet			1
the tachycardia was not on the paper towel			2
' but the tachycardia had no bearing on her death , according to experts			2
it was as mrs @entity7 was leaving hospital that she collapsed for a second time			1
mr @entity20 said : ' she was told to go to the desk to be discharged and she was walking really slowly there			0

' over the next few days , she was the same - really tired and had problems breathing			0
' he said his wife had told ambulance staff on an earlier occasion she was suffering chest pains			0
he said : ' she told the ambulance she always has chest pains			0
' a post-mortem examination showed the @entity89 had started in her pelvis and spread to her lungs in the space of around a week			2
she had not complained of pain in her legs prior to her death , which is a key symptom of @entity89			1
community midwife @entity96 said she saw mr @entity20 on the 21st and he did not express any concerns about his wife 's health			0
she said she had no notes of her complaining about chest pain of shortness of breath			1
paramedics called to the house on august 29th did not record any mention of chest pains or shortness of breath either - claiming mrs @entity7 simply did not tell them			1
expert witness , mr @entity109 , said : ' even if the massive embolism had been spotted on august 29th , it might not have helped mrs @entity7			1
' coroner @entity112 adjourned the inquest until friday			0
