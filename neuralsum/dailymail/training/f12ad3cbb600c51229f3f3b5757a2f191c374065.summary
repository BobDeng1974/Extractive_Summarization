' two young white men on the other side of the street - even in the same clothes - do not			0

‘ at many points in @entity6 history law enforcement has enforced the status quo , a status quo that was often brutally unfair to disfavoured groups ’			1
the director said it was also important to break a cycle that means often ethnic minorities in poor neighborhoods too often inherit a ' legacy of crime and prison , ' a cycle he said must be broken to improve race relations with police			1
the death of @entity23 has seen protesters take to the streets across @entity6 however he said that racial bias was not endemic in the force and most officers were committed to doing the right thing			2
