by @entity0 the ' eyes ' of the laser weapon , which can track an object the size of a bullet , and hit a drone from two miles away one of the most powerful laser weapons ever fired has successfully shot drones out of the sky from two miles away			2
the groundbreaking weapon uses a high powered @entity12 laser , and is powerful enough to cut through a steel girder from 1km away , yet accurate enough to hit a target the size of a mortar round			1
@entity17 , the firm who developed it , say it could eventually become commonplace on the battlefield , and are developing a smaller version that could be taken to the front line to protect troops			2
the latest test was conducted at @entity17 â€™s @entity25 ( @entity26 ) in @entity27 , in snowy conditions and blinding sunlight , and engineers are already drawing up plans to double the power of the laser before its next test			0
' the demonstration delivered compelling evidence for the @entity12 weapon technology , ' a spokesman said			0
' a massive , 15mm - thick steel girder was cut through at a distance of 1,000 metres , and the successful shooting down of several nose - diving target drones at a range of two kilometres formed the second major highlight			1
' the team were also able to use the system to track and blow up a ball bearing the size of a mortar round			1
' a steel ball measuring 82 mm in diameter and travelling at approximately 50 m / sec , the target replicated a mortar round , the firm said			1
' the @entity56 fire control unit immediately detected the target , followed by mechanical tracking with the @entity59 laser weapon station			0
' at this point , the @entity60 of the laser weapon module took over , optically tracking the target , which was then engaged and destroyed in flight , leaving no doubt as to the tactical viability of using laser weapons			0
' the system is currently mounted of a series of large metal containers			0
however , the firm is developing a smaller , portable version that could easily be transported to the battlefront			1
the system uses a radar detection system called @entity56 to spot targets and track them			2
once the target is acquired , the two laser weapons use their ' beam forming units ' to focus and fire the laser beam on a ' fire sector ' the system works out			2
in the most impressive test , the @entity83 defence firm used the high - energy laser equipment to shoot fast - moving drones at a distance			1
the system , which uses two laser weapons combined to form a single beam , was also used to cut through a steel girder a kilometre away			1
the system used a radar to detect the drones			0
' though they were flying at over 50 metres a second , the @entity56 radar had no trouble detecting the incoming unmanned aerial vehicles at a distance of three kilometres ' then the @entity59 weapon station used the @entity56 data to carry out rough tracking mechanically			0
' the optical tracking system in the @entity104 ( @entity105 ) in the individual laser weapon modules performed fine tracking of the @entity108			2
after reaching the programmed fire sector the laser weapon modules engaged the @entity108 immediately and destroyed the incoming @entity108 within a few seconds			0
the third highlight : detection , pursuit and successful engagement of an extremely small ballistic target			0
one of the two laser systems used in the test , which are powerful enough to cut a steel girder from 1,000m away			1

high powered laser is powerful enough to cut through a steel girder from 1km away
system is so accurate it could track and destroy an 82mm ball bearing designed to replicate a mortar round
@entity83 firm hopes to *create* a portable version that could be used on the battlefield
