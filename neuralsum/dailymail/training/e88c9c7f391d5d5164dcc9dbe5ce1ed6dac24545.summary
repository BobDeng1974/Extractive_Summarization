there is growing concern that the @entity2 could become gripped by a measles epidemic , according to the head of the @entity5			1
@entity6 , director of the @entity5 , said his agency is ' very concerned ' about the possibility of a large measles outbreak in the @entity2 his fears come as a growing number of people who have not been vaccinated against the disease are being exposed to the rest of the population			1
' that number is building up among young adults in society , and that makes us vulnerable			0
' we have to make sure that measles does n't get a foothold in the @entity2 it 's been actually eliminated from this country for 15 years			2
' all of our cases result , ultimately , from individuals who have traveled and brought it back here			0
' at last count , there were 102 reported cases of measles in 14 states across the country			0
however , this looks set to grow			0
the @entity5 has now launched an aggressive campaign to combat the spread of the disease which can be highly contagious			1
the organization aims to identify and isolate people who may have the disease in order to stop it spreading further			0
@entity6 advised that the best way to halt the spread of the disease is by getting vaccinated and said that the vaccine is both safe and effective			1
at least 92 percent of the population is vaccinated			0
however , the number of children who are not vaccinated , is higher in some states , particularly in @entity57 where the most recent outbreak of the disease was linked to @entity61 theme parks			1
yet , this outbreak , according to @entity62 probably came from overseas , carried either by a foreign tourist or by an @entity2 coming back with the virus			2
to date , the virus from @entity68 has infected 94 people in eight states , and 67 can be clearly linked to the theme park , health officials report			0
' we do n't know exactly how this outbreak started but we do think it was likely a person infected with measles overseas , ' dr. @entity72 of the @entity5 said			2
vaccination : a child gets a vaccinated , but in southern @entity57 , eight percent of kindergarteners fail to get the required immunizations against measles , mumps and rubella outbreak : the outbreak of measles that started in @entity57 's @entity68 has infected 94 people in eight states , and 67 can be clearly linked to @entity68 , @entity57 health officials report ' we assume that someone got infected with measles overseas , visited @entity68 park , and spread the disease to others			1
' according to @entity93 , in southern @entity57 , eight percent of kindergarteners fail to get the required immunizations against measles , mumps and rubella			0
meanwhile , in @entity98 , it 's 15 percent of kindergarteners , because many parents simply do not want to ' risk ' getting their child vaccinated			1
@entity6 told the tv show that some parents who opt out of vaccinations cited a ' personal belief , ' but it never appeared to be for a particularly strong reason			2
he also warned that parents are putting their child at risk if they do not vaccinate them , and this also puts others at risk too			1
the @entity5 is keen to avoid a devastating outbreak similar to the one which took hold in 1989 and 1991 , when 55,000 people got measles and 123 died			0
measles was eliminated in the @entity2 in 2000 , but a few imported cases come in every year			0
but the @entity5 director does not want to see widespread mandatory vaccinations rolled out , like in @entity123 and @entity124 , which have nearly 100 percent vaccination rates .			1

@entity6 , the director of the @entity5 said his agency is ' very concerned '
the @entity5 has launched a campaign to combat the spread of the disease
but a growing number of kindergarteners are not vaccinated in @entity2
he warned it is a risk to not vaccinate your child and puts others at risk
