by @entity0 published : 05:50 est , 21 march 2012 updated : 11:25 est , 21 march 2012 the economy will grow by more than expected this year but the crisis in the euro is ‘ a major risk ’ to @entity6 , the chancellor said today			1
@entity7 said growth forecasts for 2012 have been nudged up from a paltry 0.7 per cent to a still feeble 0.8 per cent			0
delivering his third budget , he said @entity6 would ‘ avoid a technical recession ’ with a return to growth in the first quarter of the year			1
he predicted growth of 2 per cent next year , 2.7 per cent in 2014 and 3 per cent in both 2015 and 2016			0
in a sign that the battered public finances are improving , the chancellor said the government would borrow £ 126 billion this year – slightly less than the £ 127 billion predicted in november			1
grin and bear it : the news was depressing for @entity7 , pictured today the deficit will then fall to £ 120 billion next year , then £ 98 billion , £ 75 billion , £ 52 billion and £ 21 billion in 2016 - 17			2
‘ so in total , borrowing is £ 11 billion less than i last forecast in the @entity29 , ’ said mr @entity7			1
‘ this will be used to pay down debt			2
’ but with the single currency still in crisis , the @entity32 , the @entity33 watchdog mr @entity7 set up to stop chancellors fiddling the figures , said it now expects the eurozone to shrink by 0.3 per cent this year			0
it previously expected 0.5 per cent growth			2
‘ of course , @entity6 is not immune from these developments in our largest export markets , ’ said mr @entity7			1
‘ and the @entity32 say today that " the situation in the euro area remains a major risk to our forecast "			0
‘ another risk they identify is a " further spike in oil prices " , and there is no doubt that the high oil price - driven both by real demand and the @entity57 situation - is of great concern across the world			0
’ @entity60 , chief @entity6 economist at @entity61 , said : ‘ the new forecasts from the @entity32 provide a rare recent luxury for a @entity6 chancellor with the growth forecasts being essentially unchanged from those contained in last november ’s @entity67 and the projected public finance shortfalls trimmed for the next five years			1
‘ this is of welcome relief to the chancellor and spares him having to tighten overall fiscal policy further			0
indeed , the chancellor has indicated that the budget is fiscally neutral over the next five years			0
‘ having said that projected gdp growth of 0.8 per cent in 2012 is still worryingly weak and hardly a matter for celebration			0
and the very disappointing public finance data for february itself highlights that there are serious risk to the government meeting its fiscal targets			2
’ the february figures – published just three hours before the @entity83 – showed that the government borrowed £ 15.2bn in february			1
warning : @entity85 last week issued a warning that the @entity6 is facing losing its aaa credit rating within the next two years that was nearly double the £ 8bn expected and the £ 8.9bn shortfall clocked up in the same month last year			1
it meant that the deficit for the first 11 months of the fiscal year was £ 110bn , according to the @entity93 , compared with £ 118.9bn last time around			2
the unexpected surge in borrowing made grim reading for mr @entity7 as he put the finishing touches to his third @entity83 speech			2
the towering national debt also jumped to £ 995bn – around £ 40,000 per household			1
@entity101 , chief @entity6 economist at @entity102 , said the figures were ‘ completely @entity105 ’ after improvements in recent months			1
‘ it seems to be a combination of a fall in tax receipts and a big increase in government spending , ’ he said			0
‘ it provides a pretty uncomfortable background for the @entity83			0
’ a @entity33 spokesman said : ‘ today ’s data shows that the government is making progress in cutting the deficit this year			0
borrowing in february was high for the month , bringing the overall total closer to the @entity32 ’s @entity67 forecast for 2011 - 12 of £ 127bn			1
' as expected , growth in departmental spending has increased towards the end of the fiscal year , bringing it closer to forecast , and income tax receipts were weak			0
’ worrying : how @entity6 's debt has increased as a proportion of gdp			1

february 's borrowing figure was expected to be £ 8.9bn but jumped to £ 15.2bn
extra loans mean @entity6 's debt *mountain* now stands at almost £ *1trillion*
