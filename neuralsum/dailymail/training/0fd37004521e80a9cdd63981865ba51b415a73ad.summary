by @entity0 @entity1 : 02:00 est , 29 december 2013 @entity2 : 05:20 est , 29 december 2013 a @entity4 investigation has found no evidence to support claims @entity6 or any other international terrorist organization had links to the 2012 storming of the @entity12 @entity11 in @entity13 , @entity14			1
the six - part report published saturday instead blamed the poorly - planned attack on local extremists outraged by an @entity12 - made video mocking @entity19			1
the @entity4 refutes claims made by many @entity21 that @entity6 was involved in the attack despite @entity24 administration assertions to the contrary			2
burned to the ground : the @entity12 @entity11 in @entity13 is seen in flames during a 2012 attack by an armed group said to have been protesting a film being produced in the @entity12 ‘ extensive interviews with @entity14 in @entity13 who had direct knowledge of the attack there and its context , turned up no evidence that @entity6 or other international terrorist groups had any role in the assault , ’ the @entity4 report found			1
the 2012 attack on the @entity12 @entity11 in @entity13 was carried out by attackers who directly benefited from @entity44 funding and arms supplied during the @entity47 uprising against @entity48 , the @entity4 reported			2
‘ the attack was led , instead , by fighters who had benefited directly from @entity44 ’s extensive air power and logistics support during the uprising against @entity48 , ’ the report continued			0
‘ and contrary to claims by some members of @entity58 , it was fueled in large part by anger at an @entity12 - made video denigrating @entity19 , ’ it concluded			1
these claims come after over a year of accusations the @entity24 administration was working to cover up @entity6 involvement in the attack , which resulted in the deaths of @entity12 ambassador @entity68 and three others			0
locked and loaded , but not @entity6 : this armed man waving his firearm in the air was not supported by the terror group , he was a local militant , according to the @entity4 supported by @entity44 : the @entity4 also claims the militants used weapons provided by @entity44 during the @entity47 uprising that ousted @entity48 republicans took to talk shows and even held congressional hearings on the matter , with @entity84 rep @entity82 ( @entity85 ) making @entity6 claims only last month			1
‘ it was very clear to the individuals on the ground that this was an @entity6 - led event , ’ he said			0
the @entity4 ' conclusion that @entity6 did not aid in the attack is bolstered by a surprising phone call made from a @entity14 militant to a friend close to the terror group			1
‘ the only intelligence connecting @entity6 to the attack was an intercepted phone call that night from a participant in the first wave of the attack to a friend in another @entity106 country who had ties to members of @entity6 , ’ said the report			2
totalled : a burnt car is parked at the @entity12 consulate in @entity13 , which was attacked and set on fire by gunmen september 12 , 2012 ‘ when the friend heard the attacker ’s boasts , he sounded astonished … suggesting he had no prior knowledge of the assault , ’ the report continued			0
@entity84 officials reached saturday by @entity120 predictably did not dispute the report ’s claims			0
these revelations come only one month after an embarrassing series of blunders in a @entity127 report on the attack alleging ties to @entity6 that forced a retraction of the claims and the suspension of correspondent @entity133 .			0

the @entity4 found no ties to any terror groups outside @entity14
the attack was found to have been planned and carried out by local militants outraged over an @entity12 - made *anti-muslim* video
an @entity6 linked terrorist was surprised when he learned of the attack in a phone call
the @entity84 has not refuted any of the claims made in the report
