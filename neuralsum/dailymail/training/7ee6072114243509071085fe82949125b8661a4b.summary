anti-capitalist demonstrators have constructed a ‘ slum city ’ made of wooden shacks on an historic civic green			2
campaigners camped in @entity5 have replaced tents with huts built from discarded wood and pallets and fitted with front doors and windows			1
some have a range of home comforts including wood - burning stoves , wardrobes , sofas and kitchen tables and chairs			2
construction : the @entity5 camp on @entity22 is becoming a slum city protesters said they eventually want to switch all the tents with what they described as ‘ mini houses ’ that will reach up to three storeys high			1
the development came as protesters camped at @entity31 last night flaunted a demand to leave sparking a legal battle expected to cost taxpayers up to £ 1millon			1
the splinter @entity5 protest began 34 days ago and picturesque @entity22 is now littered with 60 tents			1
but locals are furious that the demonstrators are ruining the historic site , which is overlooked by @entity41			2
conservative councillor @entity42 , 46 , called for the ’ immediate eviction ’ of the group			2
@entity45 : the protesters have started building homes on the normally lush green lawn in the centre of the city bedding in : washing up time around the wooden built structure at the centre of the anti-capital protest he said : ‘ i have seen the structures and the area is a real state of concern			1
the sooner it is all removed and the protestors are evicted the better			1
‘ obviously the process of clearing it up will be at the expense of the taxpayer with the pressures on public finances			2
‘ it is a complete abuse to stay so long			0
it is a chronic shame that they have and the longer they stay the more they are depriving the public of @entity22			0
’ the wooden pallets have been hammered together over the previously green grass - now destroyed into mud - and the shacks have been built on top			0
hard at work : @entity78 , 29 , washes dishes on a hand built work surface as part of the occupy protests protestors have even mapped out ‘ roads ’ through the camp made of pallets topped with pieces of old carpet			1
they have also erected a gazebo reception area with chairs and cushions and boards listing their aims			0
there are currently six shacks , including a communal kitchen area where food is prepared			0
occupy @entity99 is the largest protest of its kind outside of @entity101			0
the first occupy protest began in september in @entity103 , where police in riot gear raided the camp and evicted dozens of protestors			1
but hours later the @entity108 obtained a court order allowing the protestors to return with their tents			1
in @entity113 , @entity112 has attached eviction notices to tents on the public highway near to @entity31			1
they told protestors to leave the area before 6pm yesterday or legal proceedings would be issued in the @entity121			1
one protestor , named only as @entity123 , 22 , insisted that the camp would soon be developed into a wooden city right in the heart of @entity5			1
he said : ‘ eventually we want to get rid of all the tents and live in these wooden structures			2
’ they are temporary and we are not digging into the ground , so technically we could pick them up and move them whenever we wanted			0
’ we want to create a slum city			0
’ the very rev dr @entity135 , @entity136 , also called for the protestors to leave			0
he said : ‘ the first of the structures went up over a week ago and since then they have built more			0
’ it is of no surprise to me			0
they have said all along that they are going to stay here and they are now making it more physically evident			0
solidarity : protesters pitch their tents at the second @entity152 camp in @entity153 long haul : ( left to right ) @entity156 protesters @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160 , who did n't give her surname ‘ it has become more visible and people are reacting to that			1
‘ at the moment we have no plans to evict them but we are asking them to leave and we have done that formally			0
’ at @entity31 activists said not a single protester had left , despite the @entity170 warning them they had to pack up their tents by 6pm last night or face a @entity121 injunction			1
as zero hour approached the rag tag group of anti-capitalists openly mocked the threat and vowed to stay put in the cathedral ’s churchyard			0
together : the @entity113 protests are being held in solidarity with the @entity181 demonstrators some protesters discussed plans for leaving making @entity185 decorations and the sign on one tent declared : ' hell , no - we wo n't go ! ' @entity189 , 27 , who runs the camp library , said : ‘ the general feeling is excitement at the moment			1
it 's brought us together			2
’ the eviction notice was issued after @entity196 police cleared the @entity181 movement camped in @entity198 which had inspired the @entity113 protest			0
but legal experts said clearing the @entity113 protest is expected to be a protracted legal battle that will rack up a huge legal bill			0
@entity203 , head of public law at @entity205 , said because of the @entity206 it could drag on for months			0
he said : ‘ it will cost at least £ 10,000 to get it to the @entity121 and if there is a lot of going back and forth with appeals as we expect , it will run into the hundreds of thousands			0
’ with the added costs of policing the protest for months and clearing up the mess made by protesters , the total bill to the taxpayer is expected to hit £ 1million			2
demonstrators have been camped outside @entity31 ’s since october 15 after an attempt to occupy the nearby @entity221 failed			1
similar camps have also been set up in other parts of the country , including a camp in the grounds of @entity227			2
@entity31 decided not to join the legal action against the protesters .			1

protesters at @entity31 's have until 6pm to depart
they threaten to burn their tents if they *'re* evicted
in @entity156 a second camp springs up in solidarity
