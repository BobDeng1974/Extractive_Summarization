by @entity0 published : 09:55 est , 9 september 2013 updated : 13:56 est , 9 september 2013 @entity1 is under fire after announcing it is to open up the @entity4 house to the public			1
visitors will be able to have a look around some of the @entity10 's most important properties during two days this month			1
however , the plan to open up the @entity4 house has been criticised by former mp @entity12 who said she was ' saddened ' by the move			1
the former politician believes the @entity1 should concentrate on properties which had ' stood the test of time '			2
it is currently being used for the latest series which is due to end later this week			0
the property , housed on a plot at the @entity42 studios , has been seen by millions during the many series on @entity44 and more lately on @entity45			0
it will open to the public on september 27 and 28			0
@entity1 ’s @entity49 director @entity48 said : ' the fact that the housemates ’ residence is not , say , a sublime late @entity54 country house does not necessarily make it less interesting			2
the house has undergone many changes during its 13 - year history ' the great houses of our past reflected the tastes of the day and so does the big brother @entity20			0
' he added : ' our tongues are not a million miles from our cheeks - unusual for an organisation not most famous for its sense of humour			0
we hope that by opening the @entity4 house we are paving the way to an altogether wittier future			0
' but miss @entity12 - a former contestant on @entity71 ’s @entity74 - told @entity73 ’s today programme : ' i ’m rather saddened by this			1
' i ’m a member of the @entity1 and i ’m not going to be burning my membership card because of this , but i do n’t think it ’s part of the @entity1 ’s mission			2
' traditional : the recently - restored @entity80 in @entity81 is the kind of property people normally associate with the @entity1 echoes of history : @entity86 in @entity87 has been selected by @entity1 experts as one of the top ten secret walks that can only be accessed by foot miss @entity12 said she accepted that the @entity1 should update its portfolio and not ' just wholly go for historic homes ' , but questioned whether it should be getting involved with the @entity4 house , rather than @entity95 , which is due for redevelopment			1
' i do think something has to stand the test of time before you can seriously call it heritage , ' she said			0
' i do n’t think it needs to be tawdry and celebrity - obsessed			1
there ’s lots of candidates around that i think you could choose for this sort of exercise			0
' the move would do the @entity1 ' no favours ' she said and warned : ' even prime ministers have discovered in their time that trying to make things look more trendy can upset people who are pretty loyal			1

visitors *invited* to look around some of the @entity10 's most important buildings
@entity1 said it will allow people the chance to visit the *iconic* tv *location*
but former mp @entity12 called it ' tawdry ' and ' celebrity - obsessed '
