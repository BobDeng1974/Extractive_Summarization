by @entity0 published : 11:40 est , 21 november 2013 updated : 11:47 est , 21 november 2013 the @entity1 , the second brightest object in our night sky , celebrates its 15th birthday today			1
its journey began back in november 20th 1998 , when the @entity7 launched a spacecraft called @entity9 into orbit			2
the launch was the dawn of the largest international cooperation effort in space to ever come to fruition			0
two weeks later , on december 4 1998 , the space shuttle @entity22 launched @entity23 , the first @entity25 piece of the complex			2
the two space modules built on opposite sides of the planet were about to be joined together in space , making the space station an international collaboration			0
blanketing clouds form the backdrop for this 70mm scene of the connected @entity9 and @entity23 modules after having been released from @entity22 's cargo bay a bit earlier ‘ we definitely knew there was no margin for error on that first mission — we had to be successful , ’ said @entity39 , the @entity40 director			0
‘ we also knew that it was n’t all on the crew			0
this was a team effort , and everyone was giving it all they had to ensure success			0
’ since that first momentous meeting of @entity9 and @entity23 , the space station has grown piece by piece			0
today the @entity1 has a mass of almost a million pounds and is the size of a football field			1
to date , station and shuttle crews have conducted 174 spacewalks totalling almost 1,100 hours astronaut @entity64 installs hardware in the @entity66 in the @entity68 laboratory of the @entity1 during @entity69 it represents a collaboration between @entity72 , @entity7 , the @entity73 , the @entity74 and the @entity75			1
the @entity1 is the only lab that can be used to carry out sustained scientific research in microgravity conditions			2
so far at least 1,500 scientific studies have been carried out in space , and the results are being used back here on @entity20 by the 69 countries that have taken part			1
the first crew to inhabit the space station launched on a @entity87 spacecraft on october 31 , 2000			0
the first crew to inhabit the space station launched on a @entity87 spacecraft on october 31 , 2000 the @entity1 's length and width is about the size of an american football field astronaut @entity95 waves during a spacewalk preparing for release of the first combined elements of the @entity1 their arrival on board the station marked the start of a permanent human presence in space			1
to date , station and shuttle crews have conducted 174 spacewalks totalling almost 1,100 hours – the equivalent to nearly 46 days of spacewalks to build and maintain the complex			0
‘ it ’s hard to believe it ’s been 15 years since we joined @entity23 and @entity9 in orbit and laid the cornerstone for the @entity1 , ’ mr @entity39 said			2
so far at least 1,500 scientific studies have been carried out in space astronaut @entity118 , @entity119 flight engineer , works with equipment in the @entity68 laboratory of the @entity1 a picture of @entity20 taken by the @entity1 by night ‘ it is truly an engineering marvel and a testament to what we can accomplish when we all work together			1
‘ it has provided us the framework for how we will move forward as we explore beyond our home planet , not as explorers from any one country , but as explorers from planet earth			0
’ @entity72 says it is confident the habitat is safe to stay in orbit until 2028 , and possibly much longer			1
