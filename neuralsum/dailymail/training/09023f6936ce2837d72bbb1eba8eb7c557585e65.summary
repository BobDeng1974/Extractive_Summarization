by @entity0 published : 01:19 est , 19 november 2012 updated : 02:47 est , 20 november 2012 a new documentary claims that @entity3 ’s ex-wife @entity2 was the victim of a known serial killer and not her famous football star ex-husband			1
@entity7 , who was convicted of killing two women in 1995 , is on death row in @entity10			1
he reportedly confessed to the brutal stabbings of @entity2 and her friends @entity13			1
however , @entity14 , @entity13 's father , is n't buying then new ' confession			2
' he remains adamant that @entity3 killed his son			2
the new theory , floated by filmmakers for @entity19 , marks only the second time an alternate suspect has been suggested in the 1994 murder			2
the nine - month trial of millionaire @entity3 , defended by some of the top attorneys in the nation , remains the most explosive court case in modern @entity28 history			0
different suspect : @entity7 is on death row in @entity10 and has been linked to five other murders , but now he is thought to be the killer of @entity2 as well domestic life : @entity3 was married to @entity2 for seven years ; here , they 're pictured at the opening of the @entity37 ; @entity2 filed for divorce in 1992 the acquittal of @entity3 on the murder charges is still a deeply divisive topic			1
@entity19 , an offshoot of the @entity43 , reports that @entity7 boasted that he befriended @entity2 shortly after he moved to @entity44 from @entity45			1
he is said to have bragged about partying with her and , more ominously , warning that she was rich and he was ‘ going to take her down ’			0
the @entity49 reports that @entity7 confessed to the crime years after he was already jailed for the murders of the two other women , even giving police a few receipts as evidence that he was in the area at the time of the double - homicide in june 1994			1
the documentary explains that the reason why @entity7 ’ name has never come up before is because @entity3 was purposefully keeping his connection to @entity7 under wraps			1
@entity7 , who at one point boasted about having killed up to 70 women in a cross-country serial spree , alleges that @entity3 hired him to break into his ex wife ’s home to steal a pair of $ 20,000 earrings			1
adding up : a new documentary bases the connection of @entity7 to the @entity3 case largely on his own confession timeline : @entity7 said that he was hired by @entity3 to steal expensive earrings from @entity2 's home and he gave him permission to kill ' that b * * * * ' if necessary he also says that while the original intention of the partnership was to get the earrings , @entity3 gave @entity7 permission to kill ‘ the b * * * * ’ if necessary			1
@entity14 has campaigned to keep his son @entity13 , 25 , from being forgotten as only @entity2 's friend			1
he has not given any thought to the suggestion that someone other than @entity3 maybe have been responsible for the murders			2
' @entity3 murdered @entity2 and @entity13			1
the criminal trial showed overwhelming and monumental evidence that @entity3 was the killer			0
there was no contrary evidence other than guess , innuendo , and rumor , ' he told @entity96			0
mr @entity13 says he believes @entity19 is playing up @entity7 ' alleged confession to boost the ratings of the show			1
the documentary does not feature @entity7 himself , who is serving time on death row in @entity10 , but it comes close to home as it is based largely on interviews with his brother @entity105 who was the person to tip police off to @entity108 ’s whereabouts			1
' gimmick ' : @entity14 , the father of murder victim @entity13 , says he still believes @entity3 killed his son murdered : @entity13 , 25 , an aspiring actor , was found stabbed to death , along with @entity111 @entity112 allegedly told @entity105 about the @entity114 murder but he did not believe it			1
later on , @entity112 spoke to a criminal investigator and went through step - by - step details of how the murder took place			0
@entity7 is suspected of being a prolific murderer who used his charm and good looks to pick up women at bars			2
he is currently on death row in @entity10 for the 1995 murder of @entity127 in @entity128			1
he and @entity127 reportedly had sex at a motel after meeting at a bar			2
he then stabbed her multiple times and left her to bleed to death in the bathtub			0
he was later convicted of murdering @entity136 , a mother of three , in @entity44 in 1995 , as well			0
her body was found in her burning pickup truck			0
he is also suspected in the deaths of women in @entity141 and @entity142			0
@entity144 authorities suspect he was behind four other murders in that state , as well			2
at one point , @entity7 boasted her murdered 70 people , though later recanted and said he was only joking			0
the truth behind the murders of @entity2 and @entity13 has gotten murkier , not clearer in the 17 years since @entity3 's acquittal			1
the timeline of the crime has long been a point of contention as @entity3 infamously signed a deal to pen a book called ‘ if i did it ’ which was ultimately cancelled			0
numerous friends and acquittance have come forward , claiming firsthand or secondhand knowledge of @entity3 confessing to the crime			0
however , the former football star and actor has publicly maintained his innocence			0
despite being found not guilty at the criminal trial , the families of @entity2 and @entity13 sued @entity3 in civil court			1
trial run : in the sensational 1995 murder trial , @entity3 tries on a leather glove allegedly used in the murders of @entity2 and @entity13 acquitted : @entity3 , centre , smiled while standing with his attorneys @entity178 , left , and @entity179 , right , after hearing the not guilty verdict in his criminal murder trial ; @entity183 died in 2005 several pieces of evidence were introduced that had been excluded from the criminal case			1
the jury found @entity3 legally liable for the wrongful deaths of the two victims			0
their families were awarded more than $ 33million in damages			0
earlier this year , private investigator @entity193 floated a theory that @entity3 's son @entity195 committed the murders			1
in a book , mr @entity193 claimed that @entity3 stood trial to deflect attention away from his son , who he says was mentally unstable at the time			0
the theory has been called ' absolutely absurd ' by some legal analysts			0
one of the key witnesses in the case , @entity203 , a small - time actor who testified for several days at the trial , has flipped - and - flopped back and forth on whether he believes @entity3 committed the crimes			0
most recently , he said he had no direct knowledge of @entity3 admitting to the crimes			0
@entity3 is now serving 33 years in prison for a recent armed robbery in @entity211			0
in 2007 , two sports memorabilia dealers say @entity3 and four other men reportedly broke into their hotel room and robbed them at gunpoint			2
@entity3 denies that he used weapons and claims he was only taking back property that was rightfully his from his days as a college football and @entity222 star			2
video : the moment @entity3 tried on the leather glove at his 2001 murder trial and @entity227 now claims the lining was purposely torn			2

@entity7 reportedly confessed to the murders of @entity2 and @entity13 in 1994
