this was never going to live up to last season ’s sensational semi-final at @entity3 but , as opening pool games go , it really was very good			2
saracens have been unable to reach the stratospheric heights they touched that day , when they routed the @entity10 giants in april with one of the most astonishing @entity13 club performances ever witnessed			0
back - to - back defeats in domestic and @entity16 finals proved a bitter pill to swallow			0
but saturday ’s bonus - point win over the star - studded @entity20 outfit proved that performance was no fluke and reminded everyone that @entity25 ’s team are likely to be serious contenders again this season			0
this was precisely the sort of advert the @entity33 organisers had in mind when they streamlined the competition			1
@entity36 impressed for @entity6 as they beat @entity37 30 - 23 in the @entity38 @entity41 is congratulated by his team - mates , both @entity40 wingers scored two tries on saturday six tries from wingers and two wonderful fly - half displays — although , sadly for @entity47 , not from @entity48 — and some typically thunderous defence left the crowd delighted			1
@entity51 was outstanding as he played all but five minutes of the match before being replaced by @entity48 in his first game for a month following a quad injury			1
two penalties and two conversions were @entity51 ’s haul , but his all - round contribution in the pivotal no 10 position deservedly earned the 33 - year - old former @entity40 fly half the man - of - the - match award			1
it will be hard to omit him against @entity64 at @entity65 on friday night , however much @entity66 would love @entity48 to have more time on the field ahead of the autumn internationals			0
‘ @entity51 ’s been good all season and i thought he was good again , ’ said @entity25			1
‘ we ’ll always do what ’s best for the team but we ’ve also got a plan in place which you ’ll find out on thursday			0
’ @entity41 goes over for a try during the match at @entity78 the likelihood is that @entity48 — whose knee was heavily strapped — will start next week			1
but @entity51 has done his side proud once again in the younger man ’s absence			1
‘ we ’ve been to @entity65 a few times over the years and not come away with very much , ’ said @entity51			1
‘ but we ’ve definitely come on over the past couple of years and we ’ll see if that ’s enough			0
’ in @entity36 and @entity41 — who scored a brace of tries each — @entity6 also possessed two razor - sharp wingers			1
and their pack , led manfully by captain @entity90 , proved a match for the hulking giants from the @entity93			0
‘ the two of them have been in outstanding form for quite some time , ’ said @entity25			0
‘ not just this season but for the past 18 months			0
it depends what you want to do with @entity40			1
do you want to go for youth or do you want to go for experience ? you ’d be doing well to find two better finishers			0
@entity36 will be unlucky not to be selected in the @entity40 squad after his performance ‘ i ’m just chuffed we showed this energy and intensity against a high - class team like that			1
they are the best team we ’ve played all season			0
’ scrum half @entity113 was also on top of his game for the home side , creating @entity36 ’s first try with a superb , darting break and kicking intelligently			1
‘ he ’s definitely the form scrum half in @entity40 and i hope @entity47 and his coaches agree with that , ’ said @entity25			2
‘ what he did for the second try was brilliant			0
he ’s playing some great rugby			0
’ @entity41 and @entity36 both scored a try in each half with the sides going in at the interval level at 10 - 10			1
@entity51 was the man of the match on saturday after a fine outing @entity132 had touched down and @entity37 ’s excellent fly half @entity134 kicked a penalty and a conversion			2
after the break , @entity36 ’s second try was world class , courtesy of sublime footwork in a tight space down the left - hand touchline			2
@entity41 crossed again on 63 minutes , just seconds after @entity145 ’s try had been ruled out for crossing , as @entity6 took a seven - point lead which they held until the end			2
the only downside for @entity6 was a nasty - looking knee injury suffered by substitute hooker @entity151 when his boot stuck in the artificial @entity78 pitch surface as he attempted to step off his right foot			2
saracens insist the composite rubber crumb pitch is no more dangerous than a normal grass playing track but @entity25 ’s unnecessarily prickly response to legitimate questions about the subject seemed overly defensive .			0

@entity41 and @entity36 both scored two tries at @entity78
duo hoping to be selected in the @entity40 squad for @entity166
@entity51 also impressed in the @entity33 clash
