by @entity0 published : 10:47 est , 14 march 2012 updated : 04:40 est , 15 march 2012 it is a stunning @entity2 summer house , set amid the splendour of ' @entity5 's finest @entity4 '			1
that 's how a planning inspector described this @entity9 property – before granting permission for four huge wind turbines on nearby land			1
the @entity9 is furious at the decision , which it says will blight the historic building 's setting and spell disaster for other heritage sites			1
the future : how @entity19 in @entity20 could look when the wind farm is installed , to the horror of the @entity9 protests : @entity24 , chairman of @entity25 - which opposed the development - at @entity19 but their fears for @entity29 in @entity20 were dismissed on the grounds that the government 's green targets – to produce 15 per cent of energy from renewable sources by 2020 – must come first			1
the @entity35 granted a company permission to build the 125metre - high turbines just over half a mile from the property , as well as an access road , mast and underground cables			1
it allowed the application on appeal after it was rejected by @entity45 last year			2
inspector @entity46 acknowledged that ' irreplaceable ' historic assets should receive the highest level of protection			2
he even conceded that the turbines would be clearly visible from the estate and surrounding villages and be an ' alien and incongruous ' presence in the historic landscape			0
mr @entity46 noted that the garden was described as ' probably the finest surviving example of an @entity57 ' , and that @entity19 has a ' cultural value of national , if not international significance '			1
despite this , he concluded : ' the significant benefits of the proposal in terms of the energy it would produce from a renewable source outweigh the less than substantial harm it would cause to the setting			0
' change of direction : the four turbines - reduced from five in the original application - would be just a kilometre away and visible from every part of the site ( file photo ) dame @entity76 , director - general of the @entity9 , said : ' this decision is a landmark case which undermines the protection of our heritage sites			1
' it provides a clear indication that our cultural heritage is at great risk from inappropriately sited wind turbines and wind farms			0
if the impacts here are not such to amount to substantial harm on our nation 's heritage , it is difficult to conceive where they would be			0
' the site has the highest heritage designation possible , putting it on a par with places like @entity102			0
' ' unique ' : the government said @entity19 was arguably the most ambitious and unusual surviving example of an @entity57 garden in @entity106 @entity108 carbon trade ' is a failure ' @entity110 was opposed by many local residents and by local mp @entity112			0
it would be built on neighbouring land owned by the @entity116 's cousin the @entity117 , by @entity118 based in @entity119 , @entity120			0
the @entity117 and @entity121 live in an apartment at @entity123 and lease out their 2,500 - acre estate near @entity125			0
@entity118 said the turbines would produce ten megawatts , enough to supply the needs of 5,730 homes a year and ' produce affordable , secure and renewable energy for generations to come '			2
the house was begun in the late 1500s by local sheriff sir @entity132 , a devout @entity133 who imbued the design with religious significance			0
it was left unfinished when he died in 1605			0
@entity9 discovered the remains of an @entity57 pleasure garden in the grounds of the manor and restored its moats , terraces and apple orchards in the original style			1
onshore wind power sites are highly controversial and only around 25 per cent of proposals for them are being approved , according to renewable @entity5			2
but many more are being allowed on appeal and campaigners fear the ability of councils to ban them is being undermined by aggressive energy firms and the proposed changes to planning laws .			1

@entity9 says development will blight ' @entity5 's finest *elizabethan* garden '
planning inspector *backed* appeal by energy firm to build turbines there
