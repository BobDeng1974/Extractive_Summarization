@entity0 : this self - portrait of @entity2 included in the exhibition shows him in the autumn of his life , greying , fraying at the edges , but more daring , brilliant and defiant than ever the bearded art critics of @entity8 had little to say in praise of @entity2 — and he had nothing good to say about them			1
after one particular savaging , @entity2 vented his spleen on a page of his sketchbook			1
he drew a caricature of an art critic , a man with the ears of a donkey and a snake winding up one arm , sitting on a barrel of grog			0
as far as he was concerned , the critics were as poisonous as vipers and had all the intelligence of a drunken ass			0
whatever the insults @entity2 suffered in his lifetime , the critics saved their worst for after his death			1
one former pupil wrote that @entity2 ’s paint ‘ runs down his work like dung ’ , another that it looked as though the colour had been smeared on with a bricklayer ’s trowel and that his canvases were so thickly encrusted you could pick them up off the floor ‘ by their nose ’			1
while he lived , @entity2 must have found the abuse he suffered particularly galling because the critics had nothing but praise for his rival @entity50 , 29 years his senior			1
@entity50 was feted at the courts of kings and dukes across @entity54			1
he was ‘ the prince of painters and the painter of princes ’ , according to one @entity56 ambassador			1
@entity2 , on the other hand , was king of the dungheap			1
still , he had the last laugh			0
who now remembers the names of the carping critics @entity66 and @entity67 ? @entity2 ’s paintings hang in the collections of the world ’s greatest museums			1
three million visitors a year see his monumental @entity73 , which takes up an entire wall of the @entity75 in @entity8			0
@entity77 wrote that his paintings were ‘ fathomlessly deep ’ and that the artist was a ‘ magician ’			1
this week , his @entity80 will be auctioned in @entity81 for an estimated £ 30.4 million — a record asking price for the artist ’s work			2
he would have been grateful — gobsmacked even — to have earned such sums in his lifetime			0
the @entity2 who looks out at you from the walls of the @entity91 ’s new blockbuster exhibition , which opened this week , is a careworn bankrupt			1
every unpaid bill , every bailiff ’s knock , every crash of the gavel as his possessions were auctioned off to the highest bidder , is there in his heavy eyes , his parchment skin , his doleful , turned - down mouth			2
his forehead is as narrowly lined as a map of @entity8 ’s canals			0
this is @entity2 in the autumn of his life , greying , fraying at the edges , but more daring , brilliant and defiant than ever			1
it is a dazzling show			0
the galleries are dimly lit , but such is @entity2 ’s alchemy that his paintings have a light of their own			1
it is as if a candle is burning behind each canvas			0
he has an eye for sumptuous surfaces : an ostrich - feather fan that makes you want to reach out and fluff its plumes ; a breast plate gone rusty in the rain of the battlefield ; a lustrous pearl bracelet			2
past the first flush of youth himself , he paints old age with an extraordinary intensity			0
her sparrow ’s head looks like a single bean in the middle of her enormous , platter - like white ruff			2
her husband , the 85 - year - old @entity145 , is painted in an ornate robe which is n’t like fabric at all , but a cloud of sulphur vapour			2
it is a bravura bit of visual trickery , this greatest of artists showing what he can do			0
by 1650 , the year from which this exhibition charts his work , @entity2 was a man who had been beaten about by life — though he gave as good as he got			1
his adored wife @entity159 , whose wheatfield curls he had delighted in painting , had died of tuberculosis			2
he had buried three of their babies and was left to bring up his son @entity166 alone			2
his domestic arrangements were a mess			2
he had taken his son ’s nurse @entity169 as his mistress , then fallen in love with his housekeeper @entity173			1
when he wanted @entity169 out , he behaved monstrously			0
he tried to pay her off , and when she would n’t go quietly , he leaned on friends to spread malicious rumours that she was insane			0
he had her sent to a @entity180 — a house of correction — where women who were ill , abandoned or criminal spun wool in freezing rooms while overseers preached the @entity188			0
@entity2 may have freed himself from @entity169 , but his debts were harder to shake off			1
@entity2 was derided in his lifetime , but @entity80 will be auctioned this week for an estimated £ 30.4million these two self - portraits show the hard life @entity2 endured			1
every unpaid bill , every bailiff ’s knock , is there in his heavy eyes , his parchment skin , his doleful , turned - down mouth			2
his forehead is as narrowly lined as a map of @entity8 ’s canals he was a paradoxical creature : a miser and a spendthrift			0
he was such a pinchpenny that his students would paint coins on the floor and snigger when he scrabbled to pick them up , and at the same time so extravagant that he ran up debts that would ruin him			2
when he bought a house in one of @entity8 ’s most fashionable streets for a massive 13,000 guilders , he took out risky loans and lied to his creditors to finance it			0
he had a magpie ’s eye for fine things			0
when the debt collectors made an inventory of his possessions after his bankruptcy in 1656 , they found busts of roman emperors , prints , paintings , fossils , rare minerals and natural curiosities , among them a stuffed armadillo			0
after losing his grand townhouse , @entity2 cared less and less about keeping up appearances to impress clients			1
unlike @entity50 , the princely flatterer , @entity2 did n’t fawn over his patrons			1
he wore his paint - splattered smock , his breath smelled of stale beer and by middle - age his teeth were rotten			2
in the long economic depression that followed the @entity246 of 1652 - 54 , those who had managed to hold on to their money were loath to spend it on a painting by a grubby bankrupt			2
it was in this period of darkness , though , that @entity2 produced some of his most luminous work			1
he became more devil - may - care and stubbornly self - confident , slapping paint onto the canvas like a butcher laying out steaks on a marble slab			0
but the results , far from crude , were endlessly subtle			0
he painted a self - portrait , which hangs in the first room of the exhibition , in which he is wrapped in a gold mantle			1
it is as if he is announcing : ‘ i have the @entity270			0
’ three million visitors a year see his @entity73 ( pictured ) , which takes up an entire wall of the @entity75 in @entity8 how could anyone have accused @entity2 of painting with dung ? these paintings turn clod colours into gold			1
even in the @entity91 ’s basement , they glow			0
in one of the self - portraits in the exhibition , @entity2 stands in his studio , his shoulders square to us , his gaze steady and challenging			1
with his fur - trimmed robe and curious white cap , he looks like a magus about to cast a spell			0
but he does n’t need anything as flash or ridiculous as a wand			0
he holds in his hand the secret to his own sort of magic : an old palette and a handful of brushes loaded with paint			0
@entity2 : the @entity303 is at the @entity91 until january 18			1

exhibition of @entity2 shows artist in his twilight years when he was at his most *downtrodden* and most brilliant
*personal* life was a mess - took son *'s* nurse as mistress but when he fell for another woman had her put in an *asylum*
derided in his time while fellow artist @entity50 took *acclaim* , but later painters , such as @entity77 , adored him
