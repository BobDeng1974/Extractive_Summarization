he then spoke for a few minutes to members of the @entity26 royal families and international diplomats , promising his ruling party ' will be cooperative ' in working with a new unity government			0
@entity2 said : ' this disagreement for the last 10 months has had a big impact on @entity3 in the realms of culture , development , politics , which led to a threat to national unity and destroyed what has been built in past years			2
' [ caption @entity2 addressed the country 's troubles without mentioning the demands of protesters who have filled squares across @entity3 calling for his ouster , often facing deadly crackdown from his security forces			2
he also struck out at those who strove to topple calling the protests the protests a ' coup ' and a bombing of his palace mosque that seriously wounded him in june ' a scandal			0

the unarmed protesters have held their ground with remarkable resilience , flocking to the streets of @entity114 and other @entity3 cities and towns to demand reforms from the autocratic government and braving a violent crackdown by government forces that has killed hundreds			0
but their uprising , inspired by other @entity27 revolts in the region that saw longtime rulers of @entity33 and @entity32 go , has at times been hijacked by @entity3 's two traditional powers - the tribes and the military - further deepening the country 's turmoil			1
