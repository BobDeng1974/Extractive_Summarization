by @entity0 @entity1 sacrificed hopes of a @entity4 title this season for @entity7 glory , but he insists he still wants to prove a point to rival @entity9 in the final two races			1
it was never a secret the 24 - year - old had his sights set on @entity15 gold this summer , with early - season disappoints in @entity17 and @entity18 evidence of a man who was n’t yet at the peak of his powers			2
his plan paid off though as @entity23 proved a fruitful venue – @entity1 taking silver in the individual event and a gold in the relay with older brother @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31			1
glory : @entity1 ( left ) celebrates his silver medal with brother @entity29 at the @entity7 attentions now focus back on the @entity4 with @entity36 the venue for the penultimate leg this weekend , ahead of the @entity39 in @entity40 , @entity41			1
and @entity1 insists while @entity9 may have an unassailable lead at the top of the standings , he wants to finish the stronger with two wins from as many races			1
' it has been an alright season but t has been a season of two halves , ' said @entity1			2
' it did n’t start too well as i did a lot of travelling and went to @entity54 , @entity17 and @entity55 and i did n’t pick up many great results			0
team glory : the brothers , along with @entity30 and @entity31 also won gold in the team triathlon ' my focus even then really was on the @entity7 , that was what i wanted to do well in , but now with that done i can do better in the second half of the season			1
' the @entity7 was something that i aimed for at the start of the year and it is always great when you do well in what you have aimed for			0
' to then complete the set as well for me is fantastic , as a kid i never thought i would reach this level so i am thrilled			0
' i do n’t think i am going to be able to become world champion now , i am behind @entity9 by quite a few points so i will struggle to beat him even if i do win the last two races			2
' to be a world medallist and a @entity7 medallist makes it a decent season really			2
i am racing in @entity36 next and that will be an interesting race as after a major games it is always quite difficult to pick it up again but i ’m back training and i want to do that			0
rivals : @entity1 and @entity9 have been going tooth and nail against each other during the @entity4 ' with two races left and because i wo n’t be able to win the @entity4 itself i want to focus all my energy on them and treat them as a mini world championships , i want to win them both			1
' @entity1 was allowed some downtime after the @entity7 and in his role as a @entity98 ambassador attending an athletics coaching session with members of @entity101 – a learning disability service for community health development organisation @entity104			1
the session , which took place at the @entity107 in @entity108 , was held by charity @entity109 and formed part of their @entity112 campaign , which aims to highlight the opportunities for integration of disabled and able - bodied sport			0
the next event on the calendar for their campaign is @entity121 , which runs between august 23 and 29 – and @entity1 believes the general public can all find something rewarding from volunteering their time			0
point to prove : @entity1 wants to show @entity9 what he 's got in the final two races of the season ' it was inspiring for me to see people not being scared of taking something on and taking a chance is fantastic , ' he added			1
' @entity134 is crucial in all sports , if it was n’t for volunteers i would n’t be @entity7 champion or an @entity139 medallist			0
' for me personally i have not done much volunteering in sport and definitely not disability sport so @entity121 is about encouraging people to do that			0
' it might be something completely new , you may be a little nervous about it , but sport is perfect for breaking down barriers			0

@entity1 admits to sacrificing @entity4 title hopes this season
but he secured triathlon gold and silver at the @entity7
hoping to prove a point to his rival @entity9 in the final two races
