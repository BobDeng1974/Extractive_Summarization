the death of a star @entity2 batsman stunned the cricket world yesterday and led to immediate concerns over the safety of helmets worn by players of all ages			1
@entity9 died two days after being struck behind the ear by a ball while batting			1
@entity9 , 25 , who played against @entity12 in last summer ’s ashes and had represented three @entity15 county teams , did not regain consciousness after the sickening blow			1
although he was wearing a helmet , a bouncer struck him on an unprotected part of his neck as he turned his back attempting a shot			2
the impact split his vertebral artery , causing a massive bleed			0
surgeons in @entity28 operated on @entity9 to try to relieve the pressure on his brain but he died yesterday			1
manufacturers have been exploring ways to make cricket helmets safer – but they have faced resistance from the players and experts admit no helmets currently available would have been guaranteed to save @entity9 , a left - hander who had represented @entity34 in 26 tests			1
under @entity50 regulations , all schoolchildren are required to wear helmets while batting and keeping wicket			2
new safety standards were introduced in @entity54 earlier this year , expanding the area of the grille in front of the face and jaw so a ball could not sneak through the gaps			1
@entity9 , 25 , who played against @entity12 in last summer ’s ashes and had represented three @entity15 county teams , did not regain consciousness after the sickening blow the peak was stiffened and more protection provided around the cheekbones and at the back of the head			1
even these improvements provide no protection for the vulnerable area at the back of the neck			0
researchers from @entity77 and @entity78 found last year that six per cent of cricket injuries result from balls striking the neck and a further 17 per cent from impacts on the back of the helmet			1
they recommended lowering the back of the shell to cover most of the neck			0
@entity88 , of the @entity89 , said helmets could be changed , with a foam skull cap worn underneath to cover the back of the neck			2
@entity2 cricketer @entity36 wipes a tear from his eye as he arrives at the @entity95 but changes to helmets have been opposed by players , who are said to believe such a design would reduce a batsman ’s mobility as the ball hurtles towards him at around 90mph			1
@entity103 , chief executive of sports equipment firm @entity104 , said : ‘ the ability of manufacturers to innovate is reliant on players embracing new technology and they are very , very traditional in cricket			1
' other sports , like horse racing , more readily accept that injury is an issue			0
’ @entity114 – the firm that made the @entity116 was wearing – said the cricketer was not using its most recent model , which gives batsmen extra protection in the neck area			1
however , a spokesman for the firm added : ‘ this is a vulnerable area of the head and neck that helmets can not fully protect while enabling batsmen to have full and proper movement			2
’ professor @entity128 of @entity129 , a sports trauma expert , said the devastating injury @entity9 suffered while playing for @entity34 against @entity131 was simply bad luck			2
‘ we should design helmets as strong as technology allows , ’ he said			0
‘ but we need to accept that in cricket and other sports that involve hard objects or bodily contact there will always be freak accidents			0
’ former @entity12 star @entity142 said helmets have given cricketers a false sense of security			0
he wrote in the @entity147 : ‘ most of my career i batted without a helmet			0
you required judgment of what to leave , when to duck and when to play the ball			0
helmets have taken away a lot of that fear			0
’ ex-england captain @entity158 said the natural response to tragedy was that massive change was needed , but added : ‘ the protection in the game of cricket has never been better than it is today			0
i do n’t think any cricketer will go out there to bat these days worrying that his life might be on the line			0
’ parents @entity171 and @entity172 and sister @entity169 in @entity28			2

cricketer @entity9 died surrounded by close family and *friends* at @entity176 in @entity28
the 25 - year - old was struck by a ball delivered by bowler @entity36 on *tuesday* *afternoon*
