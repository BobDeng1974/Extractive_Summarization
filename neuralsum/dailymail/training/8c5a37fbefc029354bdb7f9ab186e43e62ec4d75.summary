by @entity0 published : 16:02 est , 20 may 2013 updated : 16:56 est , 20 may 2013 its 26 - year - old founder has played predictably fast and loose with corporate etiquette , signing off news of @entity6 ’s $ 1.1billion cash purchase of @entity7 with ‘ f * * * yeah			1
’ new boss , @entity9 , is thrilled she says at the deal she describes as her ‘ stake in the ground ’ as the tech giant ’s new ceo			1
but amid all the clamour and noise over @entity6 ’s purchase of @entity20 ’s micro-blogging site , @entity7 , one voice has been curiously absent until now - prompting speculation that this much celebrated deal is not universally welcome			1
' f * * * yeah ' : when his @entity7 co-developer quit in 2010 @entity20 , pictured , claimed he would never sell out three years on he has sold his site for $ 1.1billion but in 2010 he left @entity25 to ‘ pursue independent projects			1
’ his initial reluctance to comment on the high profile sale of the site has re-ignited speculation that the relationship between @entity20 and @entity32 soured in recent years			1
when approached directly by @entity33 said : ‘ i really do n’t want to respond in any way until i post my thoughts on my own site			0
’ asked if he was pleased for @entity25 he simply re-iterated his desire not to comment			0
what 's next ? the retweet that hints at @entity32 's true feelings over @entity7 's sale ? and while friends , fans and site - users immediately posted on @entity45 , @entity32 waited until the close of the day before issuing a pointedly measured response to the sale , a review of his relationship with @entity20 and his own role in the creation of the fantastically successful site			1
writing on his own site he admitted : ' i did n't have any advance knowledge of the @entity6 acquisition - i got official confirmation this morning , just like the public			2
when i read the rumor a few days ago on @entity62 , i did n't know whether to believe it			0
' he continued : ' generally , what @entity65 needs , and what @entity7 has always needed , is to get support and maintenance roles off of @entity20 's plate so he can focus on the product			1
' he described himself as ' optimistic ' at the sale , adding , ' this is clearly what @entity20 believes is best for his product			2
' he does n’t follow his former boss on @entity45 and though he lists his involvement with @entity7 on online profiles he rarely refers to @entity25 by name since leaving his organisation three years ago			2
@entity80 : former co-developer @entity32 , left , and @entity20 , the man who ' is ' @entity7 the new boss : @entity9 , @entity6 ceo who has bought @entity7 with the promise ' not to screw it up ' @entity32 was just two years out of college when he replied to an advertisement posted by @entity20 on @entity85			1
reflecting on that time @entity20 once said he was ‘ just stupid lucky ’ to meet @entity32 in this fashion			2
as for @entity32 he opted for the role with @entity88 over an offer from @entity90 though at the time he was confused as to exactly who his boss would be			0
with no corporate experience to speak of , @entity20 had asked @entity94 , the founder of animation production company @entity95 and a family friend who had offered him an internship when he was 15 , to sit in on his interview with @entity32			1
the world at his feet : @entity20 with girlfriend @entity101 , the couple live in @entity103 's @entity102 with their @entity104 , @entity106 it was during a lull in client work that @entity20 and @entity32 set to work on building the tumblelogging tool of @entity20 ’s imagination			1
what began as a side - project took on a life of its own			0
a small group of angel investors came up with $ 775,000 in return for a stake in the site then valued at just $ 3million			0
@entity20 enlisted the help of more experienced men ; @entity32 concentrated on making the site work			2
@entity20 was just 20 years old			0
he was opposed to advertising , visionary in his determination that his site should not show numbers of followers – an online habit that , he has said , ‘ poisons the community ’ – and unequivocal in his hope to ‘ never sell - out			0
’ when @entity32 left @entity7 in 2010 to develop his own successful internet project – @entity135 , a bookmark and reading service – @entity20 was still holding to that line			1
the @entity6 deal has made @entity20 an extremely wealthy young man and one who certainly need never worry about money again			1
' as for me , ' @entity32 writes , ' @entity20 was generous with my employee stock options back in the day			2
i wo n't make yacht - and - helicopter money from the acquisition , and i wo n't be switching to decidated day and night @entity147			0
' but as long as i manage investments properly and do n't spend recklessly , @entity7 has given my family a strong safety net and			0
. the freedom to work on whatever i want			0
' it is a decidely restrained response			0
and perhaps a clue to @entity32 ’s true feelings on @entity20 's cashing in can be found in his retweet of a humorous message from a friend			2
referring to @entity32 ’s dog , hops – an internet character in his own right with a @entity165 of his own – the post simply reads : ‘ what next @ marcoarment ? are you gon na sell @ hopsarment too ? '			0

for years @entity20 *resisted* the lure of @entity170 and the money that ' selling out ' offered
now @entity7 's 26 - year - old founder has signed a $ 1.1billion deal with tech giant @entity6
former lead developer @entity32 left the company in 2010
so why is the first man employed by @entity20 the last to comment on the *historic* sale ?
