a rare species has been sighted in a @entity2 lake just a month after scientists said it may be extinct in the wild			2
the axolotl is a newt - like creature which has furry external gills , small feet and a tail and its only known natural habitat is one lake system near @entity12			1
scientists thought it had become extinct last month , killed by pollution from surrounding slums and out - competed by larger fish , after they failed to find one while surveying the waters			1
researchers investigating the axolotl in @entity12 say they have spotted the creature twice after a previous group of researchers said it may be extinct in the wild the newt - like animal has only one known habitat , the @entity29 series of lakes and canals near @entity12 which were built by ancient @entity32 to grow food however a different team say they have twice spotted the small creature , nicknamed the ' water monster ' , although they have yet to catch one			1
biologist @entity38 , of @entity12 's @entity39 , said : ' we were n't able to capture them because the behavior of the axolotl makes them very difficult to capture			2
' we have n't had any captures , but we have had two sightings			0
that 's important , because it tells us we still have a chance			0
' its only natural habitat is the @entity29 network of lakes and canals â€” the ' floating gardens ' of earth piled on reed mats that the @entity58 built to grow crops			1
the axolotl is scientifically important because , aside from its strange looks , it also has the ability to regenerate severed limbs			0
the animal has external gills which form a sort of mane around its head , a tail , small feet and a mouth which curves into a weird smile - all contributing to its strange appearance scientifically the axolotl is interesting because it has the ability to regenerate severed limbs some axolotls still survive in aquariums , water tanks and research labs , but experts said those conditions are n't the best , because of interbreeding the axolotl is endangered because of sewage from nearby slums which leak into the waters of the lake , and also competition from fish such as carp and tilapia which have been introduced releasing captive - bred axolotls into the wild could spread a fungus infection that is fatal to them and could reduce their genetic diversity			1
@entity38 said some small mutations , possibly the result of interbreeding , have already been seen			0
alarmed by the creature 's falling numbers in recent years , researchers built axolotl " shelters " in @entity102 to help them breed in the cleanest part of their remaining habitat			1
@entity107 of rocks and reedy plants act as filters around a selected area , and cleaner water is pumped in , to create better conditions			0
the shelters also include permeable cages and other devices intended to help protect axolotls from non-native carp and tilapia that were introduced to the lake system years ago and compete with axolotls for food			2
growing up to a foot long ( 30 centimeters ) , axolotls use four stubby legs to drag themselves along the bottom or thick tails to swim in @entity102 's murky channels while feeding on aquatic insects , small fish and crustaceans			2
but the surrounding garden - islands have increasingly been converted to illicit shantytowns , with untreated sewage often running off into the water			0
the @entity135 said in a statement that a 1998 survey found an average of 6,000 axolotls per square kilometer , a figure that dropped to 1,000 in a 2003 study and 100 in a 2008 survey .			0

@entity145 is a strange newt - like creature which lives in @entity12
its only known natural habitat is a lake system near @entity12
last month researchers thought it had *vanished* after failing to find one while carrying out a survey of the @entity102 waters
a new team now say they have spotted two , but have n't captured them
