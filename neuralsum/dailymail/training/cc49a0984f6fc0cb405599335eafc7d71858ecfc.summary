by @entity0 published : 20:29 est , 19 november 2013 updated : 20:33 est , 19 november 2013 archbishop of @entity2 , dr @entity3 , has warned that , for many people , their standards of living are falling the archbishop of @entity2 has warned of the growth of a ' new poor ' who have jobs and work hard but still live in poverty			1
dr @entity3 , second in the hierarchy of the @entity13 , told its @entity14 that many people who previously enjoyed comfortable lifestyles were seeing their standard of living fall significantly			1
such people - who he called ' the new poor ' - feel they are going ' down the social scale ' through no fault of their own , he said			1
' unlike the chief executives , many hard - pressed people find that they are on a ' down escalator ' , ' he said			2
' that phrase captures more than just a shortage of money - it adds a sense of descending the social scale			1
' dr @entity3 added that many such people no longer believed that they could provide a better life for their children than they had enjoyed themselves			1
' formerly , each new generation enjoyed a higher standard of living than the previous one , ' he said			1
' that was the progress that everybody was taught to expect			2
it was a source of hope			2
' but now the gains are being reversed			0
many people believe their children will be worse off financially than they are			0
' he added that while ' once upon a time , you could not really be living in poverty if you had regular wages ' , this was ' no longer so '			1
now , he said , ' you can be in work and still live in poverty ' , adding : ' politicians often refer to hard - working families			0
they should speak instead of hard - pressed families			0
' speaking in his presidential address to the @entity56 - the parliament of the @entity13 - dr @entity3 said the annual salaries of chief executives of @entity61 's 100 largest companies ' reached an average of Â£ 4.3 million last year , or 160 times average wages '			1
meanwhile , he said , 27,000 people in @entity65 were diagnosed as suffering from malnutrition last year - ' not in @entity68 , not @entity69 , not @entity70 , but @entity65			0
' the @entity71 defines malnutrition as poor nutrition , and it can include people who eat too much or eat the wrong things as well as those who eat too little			2
concern : @entity78 ( right ) , the archbishop of @entity80 , and dr @entity3 , the archbishop of york poverty warning : dr @entity3 , the archbishop of @entity2 , addresses the @entity14 dr @entity3 said such figures left a ' dark stain on our consciences ' - but he added it was a ' hard economic fact ' that wage rises were likely to lag behind price rises in future , as a result of global competition for jobs and technological advances			1
' this is the new reality			0
food banks are not going to go away any time soon , ' the @entity3 said			1
' prices are rising more than three times faster than wages			0
' this has been going on for 10 years now			0
and for people slipping into poverty , the reality is much harsher			0
' official poverty figures , which draw a poverty line at 60 per cent of average household income , have been showing that rising numbers of people with jobs have been falling into poverty since 2004 - three years before the onset of recession			2
last week a study for the @entity2 - based @entity115 by the left - wing @entity116 said that traditional families with stay - at - home mothers and fathers who work are now more likely than to be poor than any other kind of family			2
there were more families with stay - at - home mothers in poverty than two - parent families where the household lives on benefits , or benefit dependent single - parent families , it found			0
the study said nearly one in three - 30 per cent - of the families with children who live below the official poverty line are families where only one parent works			0
the archbishop said the need to combat poverty could provide the @entity13 with a moment similar to the foundation of @entity143 250 years ago , when @entity144 concentrated heavily on the poor and working people			1
' the @entity13 , i believe , has arrived at another such moment ' , dr @entity3 said			1
' confronting poverty is again rising to the top of the agenda			0

dr @entity3 said standards of living are falling significantly
he was speaking to the @entity13 's @entity14
@entity3 said ' the new poor ' feel they are going ' down the social scale '
