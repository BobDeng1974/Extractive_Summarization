by @entity0 a new computer program is scanning satellite images from @entity3 looking for faces hidden in the world 's landscape			1
@entity7 has been developed by @entity10 design studio @entity8 and uses an algorithm that can highlight land masses and terrains with face - like features			1
the system scans the world , switches to the next zoom level , and starts the scan again taking snapshots and coordinates of the faces it finds			1
scroll down to video this face was found in the @entity26 region of @entity27 , in the @entity28 of the country			2
this part of the world is mainly made up of mountainous desert , tundra , and forests this image is one of the faces found in the @entity38			1
it was taken next to @entity40 in @entity41 in @entity42 and could be either a human face in profile , or the face of an animal			2
trees appear to form the face 's mouth and nostrils in 1976 @entity51 sent two spacecraft called @entity53 1 and @entity54 to the @entity56 region of @entity57			2
both spacecraft took images of the planet 's surface and beamed them back to @entity51 scientists on @entity63			0
one image , taken on 25 july 1976 by @entity53 , showed what appeared to be a face in the rocks			2
this ' face on @entity57 ' image was taken about half - way between the @entity71 and @entity72 in @entity56			2
when the image was seen by @entity53 chief scientist @entity75 , he dismissed it as a ' trick of light and shadow '			0
but another image taken at a different angle also appeared to show a face in the planet 's surface , and was found by @entity83 and @entity84 , two computer engineers at @entity51 's @entity86			2
a total of 18 images of the @entity89 were taken by the @entity53 orbiters			0
the entire scan is expected to take several months because each time the scanner zooms in , the amount of time it takes to scan the images and travel the globe increases			2
@entity99 founders @entity100 and @entity101 from @entity102 used @entity103 - an open - source creative coding program - to develop the algorithm			0
in a blog about the project , the founders explained that they developed the idea for the @entity108 because they wanted to explore ' how the psychological phenomenon of @entity110 could be generated by a machine			1
' @entity110 is the tendency to see faces in clouds or inanimate objects , or hear hidden messages when songs are played backwards , for example			1
human eyes can spot faces within their environment and it helps them recognise friends in a crowd , work out how fast a car is travelling , and see patterns			0
@entity128 claims that we also tend to use this ability to ' enrich our imagination ' and ' recognise meaningful shapes in clouds or detect a great bear upon astrological observations			1
' another image captured by the @entity7 project in @entity27			1
this grumpy - looking face was found in the @entity138 , in the @entity139 - an area also known as @entity138			0
@entity142 leaders created the autonomous oblast in 1934 as a result of @entity146 's nationality policy to give the @entity148 population an area in which to practice @entity151 culture this frowning face with large teeth was found in the @entity154 , or @entity155 , of @entity27			0
@entity154 makes up half of the @entity28 of the country and is the largest subnational governing body by area in the world to see if a machine could detect this phenomenon , @entity100 and @entity101 wrote a computer algorithm that mimics the way human eyes work and our tendency to distinguish faces			1
they were inspired by the face on @entity57 image taken by the @entity172 - one of two spacecraft sent to @entity57 by @entity51 in july 1976			0
@entity100 and @entity101 said : ' our @entity108 already circumnavigated the world a couple of times and astonished us with quite versatile results			1
' as it continues to travel the world within the upcoming months , it continuously zooms into the @entity63			0
' some of the detected images are nâ€™t usable at all , as we are not able to recognize any face - like patterns within the detected images			0
the @entity183 also discovered this image in the @entity26 region of @entity27			0
the face detector uses a computer algorithm that attempts to mimic how human eyes work , in particular their ability to see faces in clouds and inanimate objects			1
this psychological phenomenon is called @entity110 @entity128 's @entity194 mainly found images in natural landscapes ; fields , mountains and rocky terrains			2
however , some faces were also detected in industrial and urban regions			0
the face in this image is seen in the centre of the screen			0
a green hairdo is shown above two ' eyes ' that have trees for eyebrows			0
it then has a wide open mouth below ' other satellite images , on the other hand , inspired our imagination in a tremendous , yet funny way			0
' however the search goes on , as our diligent robot continuous investigation			0
' the team use the face detection algorithm on top of different satellite images and stores the geographical coordinates			1
they then use software to send these coordinates from the @entity108 to a virtual browser scanning @entity3 images in @entity230			1
this face is n't as instantly recognisable as some of the other images captured by the @entity7 project , yet you can see its eyes , nose and what appears to be a quiff - style haircut			1
this image was taken on the side of one of the mountains at the @entity244 and @entity245 in @entity246			0
the park is home to @entity249 - the tallest peak in @entity251 the @entity7 tracker scans the satellite images from @entity3 using a computer algorithm			1
when it detects an area of land that appears to look like a face , the features are highlighted and the coordinates are sent to the design team in @entity10 to record its location and take a screenshot of the hidden face			1

@entity7 project is scanning the world one zoom level at a time , recording the coordinates of each hidden face
@entity108 uses an algorithm developed by @entity10 company @entity128 that mimics how humans have a tendency to see faces in everything
