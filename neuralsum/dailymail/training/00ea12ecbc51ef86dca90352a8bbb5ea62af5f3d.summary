the closest the @entity2 came to referring to allegations of torture , kidnap and other abuses was when he said the gathering needed to address the ‘ security ’ of its members nations and referred to the ‘ touch of healing ’ the 53 - nation body can bring			1
although the @entity9 is @entity19 she has decided to scale down her long - haul international travel and asked her son to represent her at this year ’s @entity22			1
@entity2 , who is normally nothing less than outspoken about issues close to his heart , will have to bite his tongue as the @entity9 is required to stay publically neutral on such issues , although critics of the regime are putting increasing pressure on him to raise concerns with the president privately			1
in his opening speech , @entity2 said : ‘ at the personal request of @entity9 , i am delighted to be addressing you this morning on behalf of the @entity19			1
diplomatic : prince @entity2 avoided referring to referring to allegations of torture , kidnap and other abuses by the @entity4 regime when he made his inaugural @entity8 speech seated from left to right @entity60 prime minister @entity59 , @entity4 president @entity25 , prince @entity2 and @entity8 secretary general @entity62 , with heads of the commonwealth nations ‘ @entity9 's deep affection for the @entity8 , and the special importance she has attached to it throughout her reign , are well known to you all			1

‘ i am especially pleased to be back among the people of @entity4 who , in recent years , have confronted great adversity			1
my last visit here , in 2005 , came just weeks after the devastating tsunami had struck these shores			1
i visited communities affected by the disaster and met many of the relief workers who were doing so much to help rebuild broken lives and livelihoods			1
‘ i recall my admiration for the fortitude shown by them all at that time and commend the progress that has been made since in healing those dreadful scars			2
’ @entity93 : prince @entity2 giving his speech as a representative of @entity9 he said that in the early days of the @entity8 , @entity31 's prime minister @entity96 declared that the body ‘ seemed capable of bringing a touch of healing ' to the management of contemporary world problems			1
‘ more than 60 years later , we should not need to be reminded of the many troubles that beset our world , some of them previously little understood , nor should we underestimate the importance and responsibility of the @entity8 's role in addressing them , ’ he said			2
he said the @entity110 , signed earlier this year , which enshrines human rights in the values of member states , was designed to ‘ light the path of all those involved in the work of the @entity8			2
