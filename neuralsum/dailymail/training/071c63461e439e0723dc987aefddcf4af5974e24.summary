by @entity0 one million more soldiers may have died in the @entity2 than first believed while survivors left with crippling shell - shock were also severely underestimated , leading academics said today			1
@entity6 , professor @entity7 at the @entity9 , says that in the chaos after the @entity2 governments , including @entity11 's , produced conservative death figures			1
professor @entity6 also says errors in casualty lists and the vast number of missing soldiers means ten million probably perished in trench warfare between 1914 and 1918 , not nine million as first thought			1
war dead : new research has revealed that up to one million more soldiers died in the @entity2 than first thought his claims are made in a three essays called the @entity25			1
' the calculation of losses is n't easy and most studies present lists of figures without explaining what they cover or how they have been established , ' he told @entity34			2
' so there is confusion concerning places whose borders had shifted ; there is inconsistency in recording the deaths of soldiers from sickness and prisoners of war who died in captivity ; and there is uncertainty surrounding the number of soldiers reported missing it seems that in several cases , including @entity11 , the generally accepted calculations are underestimates			1
' confusion : academics have said that discrepancies about how many men died in captivity or went missing means the death figures between 1914 and 1918 are skewed the book 's editor , @entity61 from @entity63 , also says that the scale of shell - shock was also massively below the real figure			1
he says one in five injured @entity11 soldiers suffered with mental health problems , much higher than recorded			2
' medical and administrative practices and prejudice led to radical underestimates of shell shock , ' he said			1
' studies show stress in the @entity2 was probably more intense than in later conflicts and yet physicians were reluctant to diagnose many injuries as psychological			2
' to do so probably would have made it less likely ( he ) would receive a pension			0
' professor @entity61 's research found that in the @entity82 the stress of conflict was far more recognised , with many more diagnosed with psychological injuries between 1939 and 1945			2
other academics have reacted to the essays , and said that while many governments were conservative in their death figures , @entity86 had increased numbers in a propaganda war with @entity91			1
others said that the conclusions on shell shock were ' almost certainly correct '			1
@entity98 troops , like these @entity96 grenadiers , lived , fought and died in huge trench systems dug during @entity2 the @entity2 changed warfare forever			1
after the @entity103 in september , 1914 , the @entity102 army was forced to retreat to the @entity104			0
the commander decided that his troops must at all costs hold onto those parts of @entity96 and @entity109 that they still occupied			0
the men were ordered to dig trenches that would provide them with protection from the advancing @entity96 and @entity11 troops			0
the @entity114 soon realised that they could not break through this line and they also began to dig. after a few months these trenches had spread from the @entity117 to the @entity118			0
as the @entity102 were the first to build , they had been able to choose the best places			0
the possession of the higher ground not only gave the @entity102 a tactical advantage , but it forced the @entity11 and @entity96 to live in the worst conditions			2
most of this area was rarely a few feet above sea level			0
as soon as soldiers began to dig down they would invariably find water two or three feet below the surface			0
water - logged trenches were a constant problem for soldiers on the @entity134 leading to the spread of lice and so - called ' trench foot ' , where constantly soaking boots lead to soldiers feet literally rotting off the bone			0
it would take the loss of millions of lives and the invention of the tank by the @entity11 army before the formidable system was finally broken four years after it was built .			0

new *history* of @entity2 also reveals shell shock severely underestimated
professor @entity6 says up to *10million* died in conflict , not *9million*
governments gave conservative figures and failed to include many missing
