a further 94 per cent of women say they do n't own an a-z , instead depending on their phone 's navigation app to get around			1

' empty your bag out and chuck out any rubbish make technology work harder for you we all now have phones that do a million and one things so use the features and ditch the notebook , the map , the camera - and download a book app so you do n't need to carry a kindle			2
use a makeup bag keep all those rogue lipsticks from rolling around in your bag			0
if it 's broken , throw it away we all love to keep a great eyeshadow palette that 's now cracked and leaking but it can soon make a mess of your handbag			0
use up small change it accumulates in the bottom of your bag and ends up weighing a tonne			0
only carry what you need that day it sounds simple but we end up carting around shoes , notebooks , books we never read - keep it light and give your back a break			0
a place for everything and everything in it 's place we live life at a hundred miles an hour and end up chucking everything into the bottomless pit we call a handbag			0
use the side pockets to keep what you need regularly on hand			0
swap bulky items for streamlined ones instead of carrying a whole makeup palette invest in handbag eyeshadow - and refill those sample size foundation bottles			0
re-evaluate empty your bag out every weekend and decide what you really need and what you do n't - and chuck out any rubbish			0
those receipts and train tickets soon mount up .			0
