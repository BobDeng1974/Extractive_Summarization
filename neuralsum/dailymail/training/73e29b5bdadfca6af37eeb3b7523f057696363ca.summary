but @entity5 , the state 's swaggering @entity4 governor , won re-election easily on tuesday night in what was certainly a preview of his presidential aspirations			1
' i know that if we can do this in @entity14 , @entity3 , ' @entity5 told supporters after his landslide victory , ' then maybe the folks in @entity18 , should tune in their tvs right now and see how it ’s done			2
' @entity5 , a political moderate in every way , prevailed by a wide margin in a year when establishment @entity4 have been steamrolled in public by tea party partisans			2
his success came via voting blocs that have traditionally been in @entity2 ' corner , giving @entity4 insiders hope that president @entity33 's two victories might be historical anomalies rather than trends in the making			1
' he ’s proved that a conservative @entity56 can get votes from @entity63 and @entity64 , that a pro-life governor can get votes from women			1
this means that those voters are available to us , that we ’re not shut out demographically or geographically – that it ’s worth the effort			0
' the larger - than - life @entity5 already casts a nation - sized shadow , but his national profile is set to grow even bigger this month when he takes over the leadership of the @entity78			2
that position affords him some control over which state - level candidates the party 's machine will endorse and financially support state candidates the party will support – giving him key leverage in advance of the 2016 presidential cycle			0
and in order to store up favors , @entity5 is hitting the road			0
man of the hour : @entity5 is poised to raise his profile even more as he takes over leadership of the @entity78 while running @entity3 and entering the 2016 presidential fray born in the @entity1 : the @entity99 - loving governor cast his ballot on tuesday amid speculation that his world - beating poll numbers , his no - nonsense style and his universal appeal would make him a @entity106 shoo - in larger than life but smaller than before : @entity5 's hirsute form has shrunk in the last eight months following lap - band surgery to control his weight			1
shedding pounds will also make him a more appealing @entity106 hopeful @entity5 said wednesday that he would be popping into ' places like @entity115 and @entity116 and @entity117 , ' states with both contentious gubernatorial races and key electoral votes for the next presidential victor			1
observers expect @entity5 to support moderate candidates at the expense of tea party stalwarts			0
a @entity4 strategist told @entity126 on wednesday that the @entity128 surge still has momentum at the state level , but ' the future of presidential politics belongs to the party 's centrists			1
' ' reading the tea leaves , ' he said , ' it seems that 2016 is @entity138 for the taking , and that 's good news for @entity4			2
tea party be damned , the next @entity4 presidential primary season will be the anti- 2012			0
and @entity5 's not going to be a milquetoast - y centrist like @entity145			0
he 's as bold as @entity147 but as universally appealing as @entity148			0
' ' this is a guy who has shown that a moderate in a blue state can sweep aside left - wing opponents by the sheer force of his personality			0
if we could just clone him a dozen times , we 'd keep the @entity106 until the second coming			1

@entity5 will hit the road as the new chief of the @entity78 , visiting states that will play big roles in 2016
the @entity3 governor win big among traditional @entity2 *constituencies* , giving the @entity4 new hope for broader appeal
' he 's proved that a conservative @entity56 can get votes from @entity63 and @entity64 , ' former @entity56 chair @entity55 told the @entity61
' if we could just clone him a dozen times , we 'd keep the @entity106 until the second coming , ' a @entity56 strategist told @entity126
