by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent former justice secretary @entity2 introduced the private outsourcing of court interpreters in the hope of saving £ 18million a year dozens of trials have been abandoned because of a ' catastrophic ' shortage of interpreters which has forced courts to rely on @entity12 , mps have been told			1
@entity2 's shambolic outsourcing of legal translation services is blamed for putting public safety at risk after suspects were released back on to the streets when interpreters failed to turn up			0
the @entity20 has found that between january and march this year , 182 trials in magistrates courts , and an unknown number in crown courts , have collapsed			1
in one case in @entity29 in march , the failure of a @entity27 interpreter to appear meant that @entity12 , a comparatively crude and time - consuming online translation service , had to be used			1
a trial is declared ' ineffective ' if it has to be abandoned on day one			0
it is then rescheduled at huge cost to taxpayers , with some defendants having to be freed on bail in the meantime			0
the total of 182 does not include other delays caused by the interpreter shortage , such as trials having to be adjourned day after day			1
magistrates , solicitors and translators warn that inadequate standards of interpretation could lead to miscarriages of justice and make @entity50 courts the ' laughing stock ' of the world			0
courts across @entity53 used to rely on local interpreters but in january this year the former justice secretary controversially handed a monopoly on translating to a private firm , @entity57			1
magistrates have lodged more than 5,000 complaints against the firm after it failed to send interpreters to a fifth of trials , sent people speaking the wrong language , or translators who are simply incompetent			1
in one case the defendant 's wife acted as an interpreter			2
in another , @entity57 sent a @entity73 to translate instead of a @entity75 speaker			2
the full depth of the scandal emerged in submissions to a justice select committee inquiry			0
mps were told that a murder trial went ahead with a beautician translating , even though she did not understand the words ' friction ' or ' deterioration '			0
standards were allegedly so lax at the firm that a director of another translation company was able to sign up his cat @entity91 as an @entity57 translator – and the cat was offered jobs			2
many police forces also use als and in @entity97 , @entity98 , three @entity96 had to be released on bail as an interpreter could not be found			0
mr @entity2 's reforms were supposed to save £ 18million a year , but a minister admitted in the summer that there will be no savings this year			0
a spokesman for @entity106 , which took over the running of @entity57 earlier this year , said performance had improved , with more than 95 per cent of bookings now being filled and complaints down .			1
