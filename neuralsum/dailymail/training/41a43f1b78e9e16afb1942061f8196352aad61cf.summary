privatisation : @entity1 was filmed during a 2012 tour telling supporters he believed the private sector offered better value for money than the @entity7 @entity1 is facing claims he backs the privatisation of the @entity7 after he was caught on camera calling for a switch to a @entity13 - style insurance - based healthcare system			1
in footage that has only just come to light , the @entity15 leader was filmed during a 2012 tour telling supporters he believed the private sector offered better value for money			1
the rediscovery of mr @entity1 's remarks will be a blow to @entity15 as it tries to reposition itself as a party committed to following public opinion which is staunchly @entity28			1
it comes as he sensationally declared he would be prepared to prop up a @entity31 minority government if he could secure an agreement on a referendum on the @entity35 's membership of the @entity36			2
in an interview with the @entity38 mr @entity1 declared that he would be ‘ very comfortable supporting anybody that gave me an opportunity to get my country back ’			2
the @entity43 immediately seized on his remarks , with a spokesman declaring that they showed that a vote for @entity15 would lead to @entity31 winning in may next year			1
but just as damaging to his standing with voters on the left is mr @entity1 's remarks on reforming the @entity7			1
in footage shot during his 2012 @entity54 tour and obtained by the @entity55 , mr @entity1 said : ' i think we 're going to have to think about healthcare very , very differently			1
i think we 're going to have to move to an insurance - based system of healthcare			2
' frankly i would feel more comfortable that my money would return value if i was able to do that through the market place of an insurance company than just us trustingly giving £ 100bn a year to central government and expecting them to organise the healthcare service from cradle to grave for us			1
' a @entity15 spokesman told @entity71 its policy had changed since mr @entity1 's remarks			1
he said : ' @entity15 believes our healthcare must remain free at the point of access			1
' previous governments have enabled huge chunks of the @entity7 to be privatised by the back door and it simply has not worked			0
' ' @entity15 believes in seeking new ideas to ensure the @entity7 provides the highest quality of care , ' he added			1
sacred cow : a @entity15 spokesman insisted that its policy had changed since mr @entity1 's remarks and that the party was now committed to a healthcare service that remains free at the point of use in the @entity38 interview , mr @entity1 was asked by the publication ’s editor @entity93 about the possibility of a deal were the party to secure eight to ten mps at the next election , and whether they would join @entity31 in a coalition in return for an ‘ in - out referendum ’			1
a councillor who switched allegiance to @entity15 has resigned as a school ’s chairman of governors after the headteacher allegedly asked him to quit over his political views , writes @entity110			1
@entity111 , 71 , has been a governor of the secondary school for eight years and never had a problem during his time as an independent councillor on @entity116			0
but five weeks after announcing he was joining @entity15 mr @entity111 was called in for a meeting by @entity118 , head of @entity119 , and told he should leave his role because the party ’s policies were ‘ against the ethos of the school			1
’ she expressed concern about a news report concerning party policy on immigrants not being entitled to benefits or state education when they arrive in the country			1
the school has one immigrant family , he said			0
father - of - two mr @entity111 , a former teacher and retired marketing director , said he was ‘ astonished ’ and ‘ upset ’ , but resigned as head of governors because he ‘ did n’t wish to cause the school any further issues			0
’ last night @entity15 leader @entity1 said : ‘ @entity111 is a decent and honourable man who has always had the interests of the school and the wider community at the forefront of his mind and it is absolutely disgraceful that he has been treated in this way			1
‘ this is discrimination pure and simple and i find it astounding that the head teacher has taken it upon herself to oust him			0
questions need to be asked about why this has happened			0
in the meantime i stand with @entity111 and i can only hope the @entity119 sees sense and reinstates him			0
’ he said : ‘ that would depend when the referendum was , and the terms			0
’ declaring he was not ruling out a deal he added : ‘ there is no left and right any more			0
left and right ’s irrelevant			0
’ pressed on the issue , he said a @entity31 - @entity162 coalition was ‘ extremely unlikely ’			0
he appeared to indicate he would be reluctant to join a formal coalition , but said he ‘ absolutely ’ would consider a so - called ‘ confidence and supply ’ deal			0
under such an arrangement minor parties would agree to vote for the government ’s budget , any confidence motions and other key legislation in return for deals on other policy areas			2
mr @entity1 said : ‘ to be honest , the way i look at it now , i ca n’t see @entity15 wilfully going into formal coalition with anybody			1
asked directly if he ’d be ‘ comfortable supporting @entity31 ’ , he replied : ‘ i ’d be very comfortable supporting anybody that gave me an opportunity to get my country back			0
’ the @entity183 have promised a referendum on @entity35 membership of the @entity36 in 2017			0

he told his party that ‘ you could go to bed with @entity1 , and wake up with @entity192 ’			2
last night a @entity183 spokesman said : ‘ this is further proof – from the horse ’s mouth – that a vote for @entity1 will deliver @entity192 in @entity193			2
that means a return to more spending , more borrowing and more tax			0
’ a @entity207 spokesman refused to speculate on any deals , insisting : ‘ @entity31 is aiming for victory and a majority labour government at the next general election			2
’ senior @entity31 sources insisted that ‘ hell would freeze over first ’ before @entity31 did a deal with @entity15 .			2
