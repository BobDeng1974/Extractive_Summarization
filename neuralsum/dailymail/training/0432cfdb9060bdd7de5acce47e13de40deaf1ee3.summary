by @entity0 published : 02:18 est , 16 august 2013 updated : 04:15 est , 16 august 2013 judge @entity1 had to adjourn sentence in a child porn case so a fully sighted colleague can view the material @entity7 's only blind judge adjourned the sentencing of a pervert so that a sighted judge can decide how serious a child pornography video is			1
judge @entity1 told @entity12 on wednesday that as he could n't view the video - showing a woman having sex with a boy - he could n't rule how ' serious ' it was			1
the court heard defendant @entity18 was arrested on january 15 this year after police found child pornography on his laptop at his home in @entity23 , east @entity24			1
the 63 - year - old , who has previous convictions for child abduction and taking indecent photos of children , was put on the @entity30 in 2008 after being found guilty of indecently assaulting an 11 - year - old boy at a swimming pool			2
during a routine police check on @entity18 in january , however , officers found a video of a woman having sex with a boy on his laptop and he was arrested for breaching the conditions of his release imposed five years ago			1
judge @entity1 , however , was unable to judge which of the five categories of seriousness the video fell into , so adjourned sentencing of the case to allow a fully - sighted judge to decide			1
he told the court : ' there is clearly what appears to be sexual intercourse between a boy and a woman			0
' in my judgement there is a very clear impression that sexual intercourse is going on between the seductress and the boy			0
@entity61 @entity12 heard that officers found a video of a woman having sex with a boy on his laptop ' there is no clear evidence of penetration and the soundtrack does not help			2
' therefore i have to decide whether i am prepared to draw the conclusion whether it is sexual intercourse between a boy and a woman			0
' it is not the grossest form of level four depictions that one could imagine			0
' however , i am happy to allow a judge who can more aptly see the video to pass sentence and decide which category this falls in to			0
' @entity83 will now be sentenced on september 11 this year .			0

judge @entity1 told @entity85 he could n't view a video
