writing in his newspaper column , the @entity175 said : ‘ take @entity10 , whom i met years ago and who has always struck me as a rather engaging geezer			1
‘ he ’s anti-pomposity , he ’s anti-political correctness , he ’s anti-loony @entity181 regulation			0
he ’s in favour of low tax , and sticking up for small business , and sticking up for @entity7			0
‘ we @entity3 look at him – with his pint and cigar and sense of humour – and we instinctively recognise someone who is fundamentally indistinguishable from us , ’ he wrote in the @entity185			1
‘ @entity193 , we say to ourselves : they ’re stealing our schtick ! and we are tempted to do a @entity171 – to overreact , to freak out , to denounce them all as frauds or worse			0
‘ i think there may have been a few ill - advised insults flying around in the past couple of days			0

mr @entity10 suggested the attacks on his party were proof that the @entity3 have ‘ lost the argument ’			1
the @entity3 swept the board in 2009 , turning the electoral map almost entirely blue			2
four years on they are under pressure from @entity82 , the @entity162 and @entity7 @entity6 ‘ @entity125 and others have decided that , rather than going for the ball , they are going to attack the player and that is exactly what this is about , ’ he told @entity142 ’s @entity215			1
‘ they know that the @entity7 public are genuinely concerned about opening up the door to @entity225 and @entity226 next year			0
‘ they are concerned because we have a million youngsters unemployed , we have wages being driven down and i am afraid a crime wave in @entity9 being caused by @entity226 already			0

@entity113 mp @entity265 told @entity236 : ‘ it is clear that there is a £ 120 billion financial black hole in @entity6 's economic plans			1
‘ if implemented we would end up going the way of @entity272 and @entity273 much faster even than if we had a @entity82 government			2
' @entity6 's wacky policies can only be paid for by a massive increase in borrowing or wholescale sacking of teachers , doctors and nurses			1
’ the @entity6 manifesto also includes county referendums on the hunting ban and a return to smoking in pubs			2
@entity6 leader @entity10 recently admitted his tax policy is ‘ incomplete … it need more work ’ as he claimed the party ’s manifesto sets out ‘ aspirations ’ rather than concrete promises			1
‘ these are tough subjects to talk about			0
all we are doing is talking the truth			0
there is nothing in @entity6 that is racist in any way at all and @entity125 knows it			2
if he throws this abuse out , we will start having a proper debate			0

mr @entity10 , whose party has said it does not condone ‘ unpalatable views ’ , told the programme @entity6 is ‘ the only party in @entity7 politics who does not allow former members of the @entity47 to even join us as a member , let alone be a candidate			1
‘ @entity82 has sitting councillors who are former @entity47 members , the @entity3 have @entity47 members in their party , we forbid it			1
’ in a high - risk manoeuvre yesterday , mr @entity125 took aim not just at @entity6 leaders and their candidates , but also at voters who are considering backing the party , many of whom are disillusioned @entity113 supporters angry about @entity130 ’s stance on immigration and gay marriage			1
@entity6 called the @entity113 onslaught a ‘ morally reprehensible smear campaign ’ last night – but the party has also faced a series of damaging claims about the background of some of its candidates			2
asked whether he agreed with @entity130 ’s 2006 assessment that @entity6 is packed with ‘ fruitcakes and closet racists ’ , mr @entity125 replied : ‘ i have met people who satisfy both those descriptions in @entity6			2
' indeed , some of the people who have assured me they are going to vote @entity6 i would put in that category			2
i rather suspect they have never voted for me			0
' he said he was sure that ‘ most of the @entity6 people are perfectly nice when they are having a drink ’ but added : ‘ it is very tempting to vote for a collection of clowns or indignant , angry people , who promise that somehow they will allow us to take your revenge on people who caused it			0
’ mr @entity125 dismissed @entity6 as a protest party , saying : ‘ it is against the political parties , the political classes , it ’s against foreigners , it ’s against immigrants but it does n’t have any very positive policies , they do n’t know what they ’re for			0
’ he criticised @entity6 for putting up candidates who have been exposed as former members of the racist @entity47 or the @entity95 , who have been kicked out of the party in the past week .			2
