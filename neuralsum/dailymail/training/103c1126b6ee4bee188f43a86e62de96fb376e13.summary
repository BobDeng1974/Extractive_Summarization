whether you 're aware of it or not , airport security staff scrutinise your body language every time you step through the gates			1
but this is n't the best way to catch criminals , according to a new study , which suggests airports should judge passengers based on what they say instead			1
analysing speech patterns rather than movement is 20 times more effective at catching someone out in a lie , according to a @entity19 government - funded study			0
analysing speech patterns rather than movement is 20 times more effective at catching someone out in a lie , according to a @entity19 government - funded study in experiments over eight months , security agents at eight airports in @entity28 detected dishonesty in 66 per cent of the deceptive mock passengers using a new screening method			1
this compared to just three per cent for agents who saw signs thought to be associated with deception , including lack of eye contact , fidgeting and nervousness			2
' the suspicious - signs method almost completely fails in detecting deception , ' said dr @entity42 , head of the @entity43 at the @entity44			2
' in addition , it costs a lot of money , absorbs a lot of time and gives people a false sense of security			2
' the new @entity54 ( @entity54 ) had the highest rate of deception detection			0
in experiments over eight months , security agents at eight airports in @entity28 detected dishonesty in 66 per cent of the deceptive mock passengers using a new screening method			1
this compared to just three per cent for agents who saw body language signs thought to be associated with deception the researchers said this could have important implications for thwarting terrorist attacks and catching other criminals			1
' the @entity19 government gave us a challenge that if we did n't think the current airport screening method worked well , then we should come up with a better one , ' said dr @entity42			2
passengers could soon see the end of liquid limits at airports thanks to an new scanner			2
the technology is currently on trial at @entity83 and @entity84 airports in @entity85 and 63 airports in @entity28 and @entity87			1
dubbed @entity89 , it uses a laser to determine the chemical composition of liquids in containers up to three litres in size			0
it uses a technique called @entity98 spectroscopy to determine the chemical make - up of a liquid by analysing scattered light and recognising patterns made by different materials			0
it then subtracts data about the container from the overall reading to leave it with a faint signal from the liquid			0
it cross-checks the remaining information with a library of dangerous liquids			0
the machine is able to separate harmless ingredients from those like hydrogen peroxide that can be used to make bombs			0
it was developed by @entity120 - based company @entity119 , which is in discussions with the @entity123 government about the technology			0
in the @entity54 method , security agents engage in friendly , informal conversation by asking passengers seemingly unrelated and unpredictable questions about knowledge the passenger should possess			1
the agent then gauges whether a passenger 's responses become more evasive or erratic			1
' if you 're a regular passenger , you 're just chatting about the thing you know the best - yourself , ' dr @entity42 said			0
' it should n't feel like an interrogation			0
' it did n't matter if the agents knew the truthful answers to the questions because they were examining verbal cues from the passenger , such as shorter and more evasive responses to straightforward questions , dr @entity42 said			1
in the study , 79 security agents received one week of classroom training in the @entity54 method , followed by a week of on - the - job training			1
researchers recruited 204 mock passengers , including college acting students and undercover police detectives			1
participants were paid £ 60 ( $ 97 ) to participate , along with an additional £ 60 if they avoided detection by security agents			1
each mock passenger had a week to research a different deceptive cover story so he or she would be more convincing when questioned			2
if a mock passenger was caught , he or she was flagged in a computer system for further questioning at the gate			2
researchers say the risk of racial profiling is also reduced with the @entity54 method because it is applied in the same way to all passengers , unlike the suspicious - signs method			2
mock passengers were found to gradually speak less and reveal less information as they were asked more questions that might reveal their deception mock passengers were found to gradually speak less and reveal less information as they were asked more questions that might reveal their deception			1
screening agents trained in the @entity54 method improved in their ability to catch deceptive mock passengers during the study , increasing from 60 per cent during the first month to 72 per cent in the sixth month			1
the agents in the suspicious - signs group , however , performed worse over time , dropping from six percent in the first month to zero in the sixth month			0
even though it is n't effective , the suspicious - signs method is frequently used because it is cheap to train , and it ' accords with people 's folk beliefs about detecting deception , ' @entity42 said			0
' when we can tell when our kids or spouses are lying , we think that those sorts of signs are going to work with everyone , but people lie differently , ' he said			0
' you ca n't assign one particular behavioural sign as a sign of lying			0
it 's how someone 's behaviour changes during questioning that reveals deception			0

controlled @entity211 involves asking unrelated questions
agent then gauges whether responses become more evasive or erratic
it was tested over eight months by security agents at @entity28 airports
new method detected dishonesty in 66 **%** of deceptive mock passengers
this compared to just 3 **%** for agents who *monitored* body language
