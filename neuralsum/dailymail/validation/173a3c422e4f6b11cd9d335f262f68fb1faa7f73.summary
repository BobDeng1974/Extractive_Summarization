@entity0 had her energy adjusted by healer to the stars @entity5 @entity0 writes a weekly column on @entity7 about the joys and stress of motherhood for the career girl who may have come a bit late to the party , but is happy to be here just the same			1
this week she reveals how it feels to be ' healed ' by hands from @entity17 ... as an avid celebrity watcher i can tell you the buzz around energy healing in @entity23 these days is deafening			1
apparently they are the new shrinks , psychics and therapists all in one			1
we know that @entity28 is a fan but also celebrities like @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 are reportedly getting energy ‘ adjustments ’ during important photo shoots			1
recently @entity36 hailed energy healers as the ‘ new shrinks ’ amongst the a-list , and more and more celebrities have been experimenting with energy work to help with everything from pain , insomnia , weight loss , heartbreak , grief , anxiety , and depression			1
as crazy as it sounded , ultimately it was a trend i was happy to try			2
after all , who ca n’t use a little bit of an ‘ energy adjustment ’ now and again ? i went to see @entity5 , who is the healer of choice for footballers , royalty and yes , dogs			1
( apparently the a-list in @entity23 get their dog ’s energy adjusted too ; and i ’m betting serious money that @entity65 is one of them )			2
meeting @entity5 , i immediately felt at ease ; at the same time there ’s an intensity behind those eyes			1
i saw him in @entity71 at the @entity72 in the @entity73 by @entity74 , but @entity5 is a jet setter ; he is currently in @entity76 at @entity77 hosting a retreat but frequently works out of celeb favourite @entity79 in @entity81 , ( he ’s their most popular visiting therapist ) and everywhere from @entity83 to @entity84			2
the treatment itself is a mix of craniosacral therapy , psychic insights and @entity90 - an ancient @entity92 abdominal massage that releases blocked energy			1
as i lay fully clothed on a massage table , @entity5 scanned my body without touching it , and occasionally pressed a point which was excruciating			1
at other times , he appeared to pull invisible ' strings ' from my body - stuck energy , apparently			2
he says that he ’s guided in his work by what he can only describe as ' intuition ' or a ' sixth sense ' to clear old traumas that are showing up as current health problems in the mind and body			2
the therapy is said to address the physical , emotional , mental and spiritual			2
according to @entity5 , these aspects are so intricately intertwined and connected that a physical problem may have its roots in an emotional difficulty			0
once he has addressed the energy ' leak ' or ' blockage ' , the body , he says , heals itself			0
@entity28 is a fan of energy ' adjustments ' and in @entity23 energy healers are the ' new shrinks ' as he worked , i felt so relaxed it was ridiculous			1
i felt weightless , like i ’d just had an intense , hours long massage – without being touched			1
at one point , he asked me if i ’d had any kind of a physical or emotional trauma around the age of 7 years old , one that caused me to be separated from my mom overnight			0
without hesitation , i dismissed it and answered no. then i remember i ’d had surgery , a complicated tonsillectomy at age 7 and was in the hospital overnight			0
he also recognised other things about my character and spirituality without my saying very much at all			0
naturally curious , i asked him how he does it and why			0
although there ’s no formal training for something like this , he told me that he began his career as a physical trainer and working with clients he began ‘ seeing things ’ – pictures and images that turned out to be connected to a trauma in the person ’s life			0
@entity156 is an ancient method of moving healing energy through your body through the hands of the practitioner he clarified that he is not a psychic and he has no power to predict the future – rather he can sometimes look into the past , particularly if a past trauma has manifested into a physical blockage of energy			0
he says that he is ‘ tuning in ’ to the client 's emotional history , clearing trauma that is stored at a cellular level			0
he claims that he can often ' see ' where the body is unconsciously ' holding ' the memory of an event or feeling which has a physical manifestation , most often in a negative way			0
as outlandish as it may sound , my overall feeling upon leaving was that just maybe these crazy celebrities are on to something			0
as i left i felt positive , relaxed and re-energised			1
energy healing may not be for everyone but i found it to be something far more restorative than i had imagined it could be			0
@entity5 is currently hosting an ‘ @entity188 ’ at @entity189 , a stylish luxury boutique hotel in @entity76 until the 18th march 2015			0
guests will have three sessions with @entity5 on alternate days and three massages on the other days , with guided hikes through the @entity195 as well as horse riding and cycling available			0
a one - hour treatment with @entity5 at @entity77 is € 85 , a minimum of 3 - 4 treatments are recommended for longer lasting benefits			1

@entity0 meets the healer of choice for footballers , royalty and dogs
the treatment involves lying on a massage table without being touched
