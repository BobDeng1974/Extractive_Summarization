by @entity0 the @entity3 missile defense system managed by @entity4 on sunday hit a simulated enemy missile over the @entity6 in the first successful intercept test of the program since 2008 , the @entity1 said			1
the successful intercept will help validate the troubled @entity4 - run @entity11 ( @entity11 ) system which provides the sole @entity3 defense against long - range ballistic missiles , and the @entity16 kill vehicle that separates from the rocket and hits an incoming warhead			2
' this is a very important step in our continuing efforts to improve and increase the reliability of our homeland ballistic missile defense system , ' said @entity24 ( @entity24 ) director vice admiral @entity25			1
a successful flight test of the exercising elements of the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) system is launched by the @entity30 and the @entity24 he said the agency would continue its ongoing drive to ensure that the ground - based interceptors and overall homeland defense system were effective and dependable			1
@entity0 reported on friday that the @entity1 is restructuring its $ 3.48 billion contract with @entity4 for management of the missile defense system to put more emphasis on maintenance and reliability			1
sunday 's high - stakes test came after the system had failed to hit a dummy missile in five of eight previous tests since the @entity48 administration rushed to deploy the system in 2004 to counter growing threats by @entity51			1
earlier this month , @entity52 said that another test failure would have forced the @entity1 to reassess its plans to add 14 more interceptors to the 30 already in silos in the ground in @entity58 and @entity59			1
during the test , a long - range ground - based interceptor launched from @entity62 , @entity59 , intercepted an intermediate - range ballistic missile target launched from the @entity66 's @entity65 on @entity67 in the @entity68 , the @entity1 said			1
a successful missile test of the exercising elements of the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) system is launched by the @entity30 and the @entity24 it said all components involved in the test appeared to have performed as designed			2
program officials will spend the next several months assessing the performance of the system using telemetry and other data obtained during the test			0
the test marked the first successful intercept by @entity16 's @entity81 , or @entity81 , which failed in both previous tests conducted in 2010			1
the companies involved had no immediate comment			0
ten of the interceptors now in place carry the kill vehicle used in sunday 's test			2
the other 20 carry an earlier kill vehicle that failed in a july 2013 test			0
@entity52 has said a fix will be implemented for that issue by year 's end			0
@entity94 , founder of the nonprofit @entity95 , hailed the successful test as a big step forward for the troubled program , and said it would allow @entity3 military commanders to reduce the number of interceptors that would be fired at an incoming ballistic missile			2
' this success is a significant milestone ... that demonstrates the system 's reliability and increases the confidence of the @entity110 combatant commander ... responsible for the defense of the country , " he said			0
critics said the @entity16 kill vehicle had still only succeeded in one of three tries , and urged @entity117 to rethink plans to buy 14 more of the flawed interceptors at a cost of $ 75 million each , or just over $ 1 billion			0
' would you spend $ 1 billion on an insurance policy that only worked one third of the time ? ' said @entity124 , research director at the @entity125			0
" we need to put the money into making the system better , not bigger			0
" @entity129 , former @entity1 chief tester and a longtime critic , called for accelerated work on a new design			0
' we need to make sure we have a system that works , not expand a system we know to be deeply flawed , ' he said in a statement			0
missile technicians watch a flight test of the exercising elements of the ground - based midcourse defense ( gmd ) system launched by the @entity30 and the @entity24 in @entity59			1

sunday 's high - stakes test came after the system had failed to hit a dummy missile in five of eight previous tests
another test failure would have forced the @entity1 to reassess its plans to add 14 more interceptors to the 30 already in silos in the ground in @entity58 and @entity59
' this is a very important step in our continuing efforts to improve and increase the reliability of our homeland ballistic missile defense system , ' said the @entity24
