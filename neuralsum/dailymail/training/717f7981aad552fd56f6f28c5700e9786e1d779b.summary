if @entity1 needed something to convince @entity4 fans to give him a fair chance then two wins in four days will do him no harm at all			1
the 54 - year - old former @entity8 boss was a surprise choice by owner @entity10 to replace @entity11			0
it was swapping a big name in the game for a guy who had spent years at football ’s coal face but without ever managing a big club			0

@entity1 masterminded a comeback after @entity59 ’s brilliant first half goal had put @entity70 ’s side in front			1
@entity1 admitted : ‘ i am a football manager , i have done 650 games , but i know that @entity4 ’s supporters perhaps did n’t know much about me			1
‘ it is up to myself and the team to go out and win them over , and i think we are starting to achieve that			0
’ for good measure he has also helped @entity35 find his shooting boots - the 30 - year - old former captain who helped give @entity1 his first win on saturday came up with another cracker			1
the 30 - year - old former captain , who helped give @entity1 his first win on saturday , came up with another cracker			2
it was a great response to an equally spectacular goal by @entity59			2
and it set the scene for goals by @entity19 and @entity106 that have pushed the @entity108 club back closer to the play - off places			1
@entity1 had called for more consistency in his efforts to turn round a season that had begun so poorly following relegation from the @entity114			2
but until @entity35 , who now has 70 league goals in his eight seasons at @entity4 , suddenly exploded into the game it had seemed more likely that canny @entity70 would come out on top			1
former @entity120 and @entity121 has been catching the eye of @entity124 boss @entity123 again – and little wonder			0
@entity23 player @entity126 shoots to open the scoring in the @entity129 clash in @entity4 @entity59 ( left ) celebrates with team - mate @entity52 after putting the visitors ahead @entity4 's @entity106 ( right ) shoots to score the third goal for his side in front of the home crowd the 31 - year - old did n’t seem to have many options as he picked up a loose ball just beyond the corner of the penalty box after 29 minutes			1
the one he took was to smash the ball with his left foot into the far bottom corner of @entity28 ’s goal			0
it was hard to argue @entity23 were n’t worth the lead at that stage			2
with the tiny figure of @entity56 – all 5ft 6ins of him – dominating the midfield as if he were a giant they had created the most danger			0
the on - loan @entity153 star picked his way through a series of tackles to make a chance that @entity60 put wide , and then tried a long range effort that whistled within an inch of the post			2
@entity38 ( right ) celebrates with @entity19 as @entity4 pick up all three points on tuesday night @entity23 goalkeeper @entity48 dives to his right to make an impressive save at the @entity76 @entity52 ( right ) is challenged by @entity34 during the @entity129 clash in the @entity108 capital then out of the blue – or should that be red – came @entity4 ’s response and it was every bit as spectacular as @entity59 ’s effort			1
@entity35 was 25 yards out when he retrieved a ball that had been headed clear , and took a touch to set himself before smashing a shot that rose into the roof of the net			0
it changed the game , and within two minutes of @entity1 finishing his half time team talk @entity4 were on the attack again , with @entity36 ’s volley falling for @entity19 to divert it home from a few yards			1
and the game was as good as over when with 69 minutes gone @entity33 twisted full back @entity52 inside out and put over a cross that fell for @entity38 to volley home			0
‘ where the second half came from i do n’t know , ’ admitted @entity70			0
‘ if they had played circus music over some of our mistakes it would have been about right			0
