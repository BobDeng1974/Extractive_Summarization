if you 've waited until the last minute to book a holiday over @entity4 weekend , eurozone sunspots are offering plenty of great getaway bargains this spring , a new study suggests			1
thanks to a strong pound , the @entity7 in @entity8 is the cheapest beach resort for a family break , according to a @entity12 report			2
those who are n't sold on @entity8 can find similar bargains in the @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17			1
a meal including drinks will cost a family of four just £ 29.87 , which is almost £ 7 less than last year			0
the story is similar in the other eurozone resorts , with prices in the @entity15 almost as cheap as the @entity7 following a 15 per cent drop from 2014			0
although slightly more expensive , @entity16 and @entity17 also offer tourists exceptional bang for their buck , the study said			0
perhaps most important for holidaymakers , the @entity39 and @entity17 offer more guaranteed spring sunshine than their bargain counterparts			1
towns like @entity44 , @entity8 ( pictured ) offer savings of 20 per cent from last year , the study said in the @entity47 , like @entity48 ( pictured ) , prices are almost as low as @entity8 's @entity7 region @entity50 of @entity12 said in a statement : ' although holidaymakers will get far more travel cash for their pounds in the eurozone , prices vary significantly between resorts , so the best advice is for canny travellers to cherry pick and book a resort where prices are cheapest			1
' ' it will be hard to beat @entity8 and @entity64 but , as the weather warms up , @entity62 is shaping up to be great value too			0
' resorts in @entity68 and @entity69 are more expensive but the good news is that there are big savings for those who want to visit @entity74 or @entity75			0
' @entity17 , while more expensive than @entity8 or @entity64 , does still offer substantial savings - and lots of sunshine both @entity17 and @entity16 ( pictured ) boast the most guaranteed spring sunshine among the eurozone but @entity81 looking to save would be wise to stay away from the @entity82 , especially in light of a poor exchange rate			1
