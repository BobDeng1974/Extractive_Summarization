as @entity1 and @entity2 prepare for their nuptials in his home town of @entity5 on saturday , the local residents are also getting ready for the big day			1
the inhabitants of the @entity8 cathedral town have gone into overdrive for wedding of their most famous resident , lining the streets with bunting and creating special - themed produce in many of the stories			1
since the @entity19 champion announced his plans to say ' i do ' at the cathedral , there have also been plans to line the streets with well - wishers as the couple make their way to the venue			2
@entity1 and @entity29 are preparing to marry in his home town of @entity5 this weekend messages to the happy couple are in many of the shop windows and several business owners have already sent gifts to either @entity1 , 27 , or his bride - to - be ahead of the big day			1
@entity37 , 52 , who owns @entity39 shop in @entity5 , sent a crystal - covered garter to @entity2 six weeks ago and received kind a thank you note which said it was ' gorgeous '			1
the ivory - coloured piece is hand - embroidered on the inside with the couple 's initials and wedding date and was designed by @entity49 from @entity51 specialists in @entity52			2
a handmade card featuring @entity1 and @entity2 , 27 , on the front drawn by local artist @entity55 accompanied the garter			1
local shops and shop owners are preparing their shop fronts to reflect the great day many of the local businesses have decorated their shop fronts with colourful bunting the card shows @entity1 in his kilt holding a tennis racket and @entity2 in her dress along with their @entity67			1
@entity2 's reply to the gifts read : ' @entity71 and all at @entity72			1
' just a little note to say a huge thank you for the gorgeous gift @entity77 made for me			2
' it was very kind of you and i had n't found a garter yet so thanks ever so much			2
' also , that card of @entity55 's is absolutely fabulous ! it really made us giggle , especially our two little dogs in the background ! ' we are really excited for our big day in a month 's time and are happy to be celebrating our wedding in @entity5			1
' thank you again for your thoughtfulness and generosity			0
best wishes , @entity93 ' @entity37 , 52 , ( left ) who owns @entity39 shop in @entity5 , sent a crystal - covered garter to @entity2 with a hand - drawn picture of the couple ( left )			1
@entity2 replied with a handwritten note ( right @entity71 is close friends with @entity1 's grandmother , @entity100 , 83 and gave the garter and card to her to take to @entity2			1
she said : ' @entity104 we got this beautiful card			0
to be honest we never ever thought we would hear very much at all so when we got this beautiful card we were chuffed to bits			0
' i was absolutely delighted			0
this was such a personal thing			0
we were really , really chuffed			0
@entity1 continues to maintain a close bond with the town - after winning @entity19 , he shook hands with all the shop owners on the @entity5 high street			1
when @entity1 , 27 , says ' i do ' on april 11 , the guests wishing them well will be largely a gathering of close family and friends			1
a local butcher has poems about the happy couple in the shop window @entity1 's status as one of the world 's best tennis players means he has mixed with everyone from @entity130 celebrities such as @entity131 to the prime minister and even the @entity133			1
but the biggest name likely to be in attendance at @entity136 , where the couple are tying the knot , is one - time @entity139 tennis star @entity138			1
indeed , when the sport 's world number one , @entity142 , was asked by a journalist recently if he would be attending the celebration , he replied with a curt : ' not invited ' , before following up with a more charitable : ' but i wish him all the best			0
' a sign telling people about parking restrictions around @entity136 ahead of @entity1 's wedding to @entity2 @entity1 has said : ' there wo n't be any celebrities as such			1
' i do n't have any celebrity friends so it was n't something that was planned			0
' [ it 'll be ] everyone who we 're close to , people we 've spent a lot of time with in the past but also people we see ourselves spending time with in the future			0
' that 's how we came up with the names			0
pretty much everything is done now and under control			0
i 'm sure a few things will come up next week but it 's pretty much sorted			0
' there will be names from the tennis world in attendance but certainly not players who are as well known as the likes of @entity177 or @entity178			2
@entity136 , where the couple will hold their nuptials @entity1 has invited @entity183 doubles player @entity182 , who he spends time with while training in @entity185 and @entity187 team mate @entity186			1
another @entity139 pro @entity188 will also attend			0
for the 27 - year - old 's many fans and friends in the town , at least part of the wedding of the year will be a spectator sport , played out on the streets of the community			2
it is understood local residents and businesses urged the former @entity19 champion to hold the april 11 service at the cathedral rather than at luxury hotel @entity204 in nearby @entity205 â€“ so they too could toast his big day			0
the reception will be held at @entity204 , which @entity1 owns			2
@entity2 shows off her engagement ring at the @entity208 in @entity209 , @entity210 , last january the 300 - seat , 12th century cathedral is much bigger than the chapel at @entity204 , which seats only 28			2
thousands are expected to line @entity214 on the day			0
@entity1 's uncle @entity215 said : ' i 'm sure it will be a popular decision , as he 's had so much support from the people of @entity5 in the past			1
@entity1 has admitted that , food aside , he 's left much of the preparation for the big day to his betrothed : ' @entity2 's been pretty much doing it ' ' i 've tried to help out when she has asked , but i have n't been over-involved			1
i did all the food and cake tasting which i really enjoyed , although i did n't think i was going to			0
he added : ' it 's a big day for @entity2			2
pretty much everything is taken care of now			0
she seems fairly relaxed but as we get closer that might change			0
