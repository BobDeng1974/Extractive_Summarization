by @entity0 published : 17:41 est , 14 june 2013 updated : 18:00 est , 14 june 2013 from @entity3 to @entity4 , from the @entity5 to the @entity6 , there was only one way to describe the news			1
well ... @entity10 , prince @entity9 is descended from @entity12 ancestors			1
the genetic link emerged after painstaking research going back two centuries to the story of a @entity19 merchant ’s love for the @entity12 sweetheart who became his wife			1
their liaison began a dna trail which eventually led to princess @entity25 , and will ultimately produce @entity27 ’s first part - @entity12 king when @entity9 ascends to the throne			1
the revelation was greeted with delight in some circles in @entity12 yesterday – followed by calls for @entity9 to capitalise on his newly revealed heritage by paying his first royal visit to the former colony			1
but 6,000 miles away , in a tiny village in @entity38 , one woman already knew the secret			2
@entity40 was told decades ago she was related to royalty through @entity25 ’s dna chain – and never bothered to speak about it outside her family			1
her grandmother revealed the link to @entity25 , as she then was , before she became a queen - in - waiting by marrying the @entity48			1
‘ i was only young at the time and it did n’t mean a great deal to me , ’ she told the @entity49			2
‘ my grandmother explained that her mother had six daughters , and that one of those daughters was the great grandmother of @entity57 , @entity25 ’s mother			1
i did n’t really know who @entity57 was at the time because i only heard the name when prince @entity61 and lady @entity25 married			1
’ in the know : @entity63 shares an @entity12 gene with the @entity65 mrs @entity40 , a 66 - year - old retired interior design company executive and her husband @entity61 , a former stockbroker , now run a b&b in @entity69 , near @entity70			1
late last year she was contacted by genetic expert professor @entity71 , from @entity72 , to invite her to help track prince @entity9 ’s lineage			1
he believed mrs @entity40 was a distant cousin of the prince after investigating a line that led to @entity3 , the western port city of @entity78 , and @entity79 , whom he traced as the prince ’s great , great , great , great , great grandmother			1
the @entity84 type that revealed the link is passed on by females and provides ‘ unassailable ’ evidence , according to @entity88			1
‘ i got an email out of the blue and he asked me if i would spit into a bottle for him , ’ mrs @entity40 said			1
‘ he came back and told me the link			2
although i knew there was this connection with princess @entity25 i did n’t know until then what the relationship was			2
’ history : @entity99 ( 1917 - 1994 ) , mother of @entity100 , now @entity63			0
they share an @entity12 gene with the @entity65 she said she was pleased to unravel the precise link – and proud to discover her @entity12 heritage , although she has never visited			1
‘ it fits into place because my brother and i both had very black hair and we both tan very easily			0
we always made a bit of a joke about a mystery ancestor and where it all came from			0
’ she added : ‘ i ’m delighted to be associated with @entity12 … perhaps i should visit now			2
’ the clue in the family tree was in her grandmother ’s name of @entity118			0
some 204 years ago a 21 - year - old @entity120 merchant called @entity121 arrived in @entity78			0
there he met @entity79 , an @entity12 of @entity125 extraction , the sister - in - law of his agent there			2
they fell in love and are believed to have married in 1812			0
the partnership produced a daughter , @entity133 , known as @entity134 , later that year			0
their son @entity135 was born two years later ; a second son , @entity137 , followed – but he died at the age of six months			0
if some of the names are familiar now , incidentally , it is because generations later , @entity25 ’s brother @entity142 would name two of his daughters @entity79 and @entity134			2
@entity121 got a job through a relative with @entity118 , a trading company based in @entity3			2
the distance from @entity78 – plus changing social attitudes that frowned on relationships between white traders and local women – meant the couple led separate lives			0
@entity79 pleaded in a series of letters to be allowed to join her husband			0
a friend advised @entity121 to despatch @entity134 , then six , to the @entity161 home in @entity162 , @entity163 , which he did			0
but two years later , after @entity121 decided to return to @entity27 , he died on the voyage			0
further evidence of the dna link came from another cousin , 79 - year - old retired journalist and tv scriptwriter @entity169 , from @entity170 , in @entity171			0
the father - of - two said he too received an unexpected letter last year from prof @entity71 asking him to provide a saliva sample for testing , which he did			0
he then received a letter back informing him he was probably 1/64th @entity12			1
he added : ‘ all this past has been revealed just by spitting into a test tube			0
it ’s fascinating how through dna you can recapture the past			0

@entity40 discovered she was related to @entity48 through @entity25 *'s* @entity84
genetic expert traced back heritage to @entity3 proving @entity12 *connnection*
