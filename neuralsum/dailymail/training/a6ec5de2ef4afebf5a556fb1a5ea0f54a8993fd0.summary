' intolerable ' : the @entity15 charity says @entity2 employs methods similar to racial profiling defence : the park claims it takes the necessary precautions to keep all visitors safe in the event of a problem the ' priority pass ' issued to tourists with learning difficulties means they have to follow a different set of rules - something with @entity34 argues does n't happen in other parks			1

we have to above all ensure their safety			0
if the ride is blocked in the dark , if there is panic , then the rescuers need to know straight away where they are			0
