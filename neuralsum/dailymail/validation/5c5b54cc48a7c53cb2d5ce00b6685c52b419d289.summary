all that separates @entity2 leaders @entity4 and third - placed @entity3 , two sides who , up until the last couple of months , were deemed to be having wildly contrasting seasons			1
the @entity9 are on a hot streak and the champions - in - waiting are stuttering , having drawn their last two league games at fortress @entity13			2
@entity15 still sit second despite saturday evening 's deflating defeat by @entity17 but @entity19 's men are out of form and look increasingly unlikely to retain their crown			0
@entity3 's players celebrate after @entity24 's goal in their 3 - 0 win against @entity26 on saturday @entity4 captain @entity27 looks dejected after his side 's 1 - 1 draw with @entity30 on sunday @entity31 ( away ) - march 22 @entity32 ( home ) - april 4 @entity34 ( away ) - april 12 @entity35 ( home ) - april 18 @entity3 ( away ) - april 26 @entity37 ( away ) - april 29 @entity38 ( home ) - may 2 @entity40 ( home ) - may 9 @entity42 ( away ) - may 16 @entity43 ( home ) - may 24 @entity45 ( away ) - march 21 @entity40 ( home ) - april 4 @entity17 ( away ) - april 11 @entity43 ( home ) april 18 * postponed @entity4 ( home ) - april 26 @entity31 ( away ) - may 2 @entity48 ( home ) - may 9 @entity35 ( away ) - may 16 @entity42 ( home ) - may 24 * due to @entity51 that leaves @entity54 's side as the biggest threat to @entity4 , something which seemed almost unthinkable come the final hours of @entity57			1
@entity3 fell to sixth on january 1 after a woeful 2 - 0 defeat by fellow @entity60 chasers @entity30 , a result best remembered for two @entity63 howlers			0
but , with summer signing @entity64 establishing himself as the club 's no 1 , the @entity9 have been on an upward trajectory ever since			0
@entity3 overcame a 12 - point deficit to beat @entity35 to the @entity2 table in may 1998 the @entity9 secured the 1997 - 98 title with a 4 - 0 win over @entity73 at @entity74 , lifting the title that day @entity3 still not in title race - @entity54 one league defeat - albeit to north @entity79 rivals @entity78 - is the only blot on their record since that forgettable day at @entity82 's , while a return of 24 points from a possible 27 is the best in the division			1
saturday 's comfortable 3 - 0 win against @entity26 was @entity3 's eighth consecutive victory at home , a feat they last achieved at @entity74 in 2005			2
and that run , combined with @entity4 's lacklustre 1 - 1 draw with @entity30 on sunday , left @entity93 admitting that the north @entity94 can be considered title challengers			1
' of course @entity3 are in it , ' he said			0
' they are seven points behind @entity4 , but have one less match to play than @entity4			0
the only defeat in @entity3 's last nine league games came against @entity78 ; they 've won the other eight @entity93 ( right ) has a lot of history with @entity54 , and he still believes @entity3 have a chance ' both @entity15 and @entity3 are in the title race			1
it depends on the momentum for @entity3 - the 3 - 1 defeat against @entity107 or the 3 - 0 defeat against @entity26 ? ' so the danger is always there			0
but i keep saying , we are there			0
if someone had told me in august that , at the end of march , we 'd be six points in front with a match in hand , i 'd have signed for that immediately			0
' @entity93 is a master of mind games and may well have been attempting to pile pressure on @entity123 ahead of a crucial nine - match run - in			0
but the fact remains that @entity3 - and @entity54 in particular - have history when it comes to late title charges			2
just cast your mind back to march 1998			0
@entity3 trained on monday in preparation for their @entity60 game against @entity107 on tuesday @entity3 lost the first leg 3 - 1 , and will be focused solely on the @entity2 if they get knocked out the @entity9 were 12 points behind @entity35 and had three games in hand with a little over two months of the season remaining but went on a magnificent 10 - match winning run to wrap up the title with two games to spare			1
the task this time around is undoubtedly more difficult , particularly given @entity4 's extra game , but @entity3 's superb home form and some favourable fixtures should at least offer fans some hope			2
as well as having an opportunity to claw back three points against the leaders at the @entity151 on april 26 , they also have games against struggling @entity45 , @entity17 , @entity31 and @entity43 to look forward to			1
@entity153 ( left ) plants a kiss on the cheek of @entity3 captain @entity156 after winning the 97 - 98 title @entity158 scored twice against @entity73 to help @entity3 to the title in 98 ... but can they do it this season ? a home clash with in - form @entity40 next month and a trip to @entity35 in the season 's penultimate fixture will be tough , although last week 's @entity51 win at @entity166 should fill @entity54 's squad with confidence			1
@entity4 also have some games they will relish but the visits of @entity35 and @entity40 to @entity13 at least offer potential for @entity93 's men to drop points			1
it will need to be some slip - up for @entity3 to take advantage like they did 17 years ago but @entity54 's men - who could well be free of @entity60 football this week - should not be discounted			1
it might not be the title race we expected two - and - a - half months ago but @entity4 can not breathe easy just yet .			2

@entity3 are seven points behind @entity2 leaders @entity4
the @entity9 host their @entity79 rivals at the @entity151 on april 26
@entity54 's side overcame a 12 - point deficit to win the title in 1998
@entity93 *insists* @entity3 and @entity15 are both in the race
read : @entity4 have dropped an average of *8.6* points during their final 10 games over the last decade
