by @entity0 published : 06:02 est , 15 december 2012 updated : 06:16 est , 15 december 2012 in the 1970s there were just 15 @entity3 tortoises left in the world			2
but now it appears that the tide has turned for the rare creatures and thanks to a successful breeding programme there are more than 1,000 on the islands			1
the tortoises which helped inspire @entity14 's theories of evolution were virtually extinct - but thanks to pioneering work the future looks much less bleak			1
road to recovery : a young tortoise at the @entity21 in @entity22 where a successful breeding programme has seen numbers rise to more than 1,000 there are now thought to be more than 1,000 tortoises on the islands of @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , and @entity31			1
conservationists began a unique project to return the environment back to the time when @entity14 first visited the @entity3 in the mid 19th century			2
the group of rocky , volcanic islands 600 miles west of mainland @entity38 are a @entity40 world natural heritage site and home to dozens of species found nowhere else			0
some 95 per cent of the territory 's 3,000 sq miles is a protected area			0
endangered : the giant tortoise , seen here feeding on a prickly pear , was almost wiped out after the arrival of humans to the @entity3 islands success : conservationists say there are now more than 1,000 giant tortoises on the @entity3 islands following a successful breeding and repatriation programme @entity14 visited the @entity3 islands during his five - year voyage around @entity58 which set sail in 1831			1
he was fascinated by the giant tortoise and in particular noted the difference in the shape of their shells between the different species on each island			0
it helped him understand how animals adapt to their environment and inspire his theories of evolution which shook the scientific world when they were published in 1859			2
inspiring : tortoise eggs in an incubation pod as part of the successful breeding programme which has helped save the iconic giant tortoise from extinction theory : @entity14 became fascinated by the giant tortoise and noted the difference between the shells of different species			1
this helped him understand how animals adapt to their environment but the iconic species was all but wiped out by the actions of the human population throughout the 20th century			1
after running out of tortoises to eat , sailors introduced goats to the island and their numbers multiplied rapidly , destroying the island 's vegetation			0
the remaining tortoises had to be taken into a captive breeding environment while the goat population was culled			0
but there is renewed hope that the giant tortiose will flourish now that tortoise numbers have risen and the species appears to have become part of the ecosystem once again .			0

pioneering breeding programme has saved the iconic species
numbers had fallen to as low as 15 in the 1970s
inspired @entity14 's theories of evolution
