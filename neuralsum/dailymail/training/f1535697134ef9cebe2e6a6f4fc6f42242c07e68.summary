illness : @entity1 , 84 , developed the little - known disease bird fancier 's lung after breathing in particles from her grandson 's cockatiel @entity7 , causing breathing problems a grandmother died from a rare and deadly lung condition after almost ten years of being exposed to her grandson 's pet cockatiel			1
@entity1 , 84 , developed the little - known disease bird fancier 's lung after breathing in particles from the bird 's droppings and feathers when its cage was being cleaned out , despite never handling cockatiel @entity7 , the retired cotton mill worker became increasingly breathless while exposed to the bird in her living room , an inquest heard			1
but unbeknown to her family the ill health was partly due to the bird , which was bought for grandson @entity28 in 2002			1
mrs @entity1 's death was passed to the coroner over fears that her employment in the cotton mills could have resulted in an industrial type disease			1
but further inquiries into her death were prompted because of the presence of the cockatiel , with a doctor having previously diagnosed her with the condition			2
after a coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death , daughter @entity44 , 56 , said : ' i certainly regret buying @entity7 , my son will be heartbroken			0
' hindsight is a wonderful thing and if we had known we would never have got @entity7			0
' i 'd never even heard of this before and it was not something that had crossed my mind , we just thought she was a little old lady with a lot of health problems			2
' the bird has since been handed over to a local @entity58 bird sanctuary to be rehoused			2
mrs @entity44 added : ' of course we were attached to @entity7 as you are with a pet but he had to go when we found out he was affecting mum			0
there was no other option , by then it just had to be done			0
' inquest : mrs @entity1 developed the condition after being exposed to particles in the cockatiel 's droppings and feathers , an inquest heard ( stock image ) the widow , who had six children and 13 grandchildren , lived with her daughter and grandson @entity28 , 24 , at their home in @entity79 , @entity80			1
she had become wheelchair - bound after developing arthritis			2
the inquest heard that mrs @entity1 had developed breathing problems in later life , which were blamed on damp conditions in a previous house			1
bird fancier 's lung is a rare allergic reaction caused by inhaling dust from the feathers and droppings of certain birds			1
birds linked with the disease include parrots , pigeons and budgerigars			2
it is one a group of conditions , known as hypersensitivity pneumonitis , that relate to the breathing in of dust from organic materials			0
symptoms usually develop four hours after exposure , including breathlessness and coughing			0
the symptoms , which can also include a high temperature and wheezing in extreme cases , usually disappear within three hours of exposure			0
the disease can become progressive , causing loss of weight , fatigue and breathing difficulty			0
corticosteroids will relieve the symptoms , but preventing exposure to the dust is the easiest way of easing the symptoms			1
when cleaning the bird 's cage , mrs @entity44 would take the sandpaper - lined bottom from it , putting the bird 's droppings in a bin bag			1
she added : ' my mother never handled him , nobody could because he was so vicious			0
he would peck you to death and he would draw blood			0
whoever cleaned him would have to wear gloves			0
' she added that her mother rarely spent time in the loving room where the bird was kept but had to walk past it to get into other rooms			0
the inquest was told that mrs @entity1 had been treated for lung disease and congestive heart failure			1
she also had panic attacks and became scared and frightened saying she could n't breath and had to be taken into the fresh air for walks			0
mrs @entity1 became reliant on oxygen for 18 months before her death and was referred to a chest physician at the @entity159 in 2010 because of the breathlessness			1
after breaking her collarbone , a frail mrs @entity1 was admitted to the @entity162 on november 1 in 2011 where she rapidly deteriorated			1
she died on november 13 last year			0
dr @entity163 , who diagnosed her with the condition before her death , told the inquest that she had had an allergic reaction in her lungs because of contact with the dust and protein emitted from the bird			1
he said : ' @entity173 's lung is an uncommon condition and we do not see it very often and a @entity176 may only see a case once every 10 years			1
' it is caused by the exposure to a bird 's protein in the feathers or excrete			1
we do not know why people get it , but if they inhale the protein there can be an allergic reaction in the lungs			0
employment : it was initially thought that mrs @entity1 's death may have been linked to her previous employment in @entity80 's cotton mills , before the rare disease came to light deteriorated : mrs @entity1 was admitted to the @entity162 in november 2011 after breaking her collarbone			1
her health rapidly deteriorated and she died on november 13 last year ' contact with the protein and dust from the bird can happen when cleaning out the cage , the dust can become airborne and can be breathed in			1
' if you are exposed it can cause illness even a few hours after cleaning the cage you can feel quite breathless			0
if you are exposed to the protein over time it can cause a reaction and it is seen as progressive breathlessness			0
' dr @entity163 added that the diagnosis was supported by blood tests , ct scans and said that she was put on steroid therapy and exposure to the bird was to be reduced			2
@entity222 coroner mr @entity221 said it was the first time in 10 years he had come across such an occurrence of @entity225			0
he said : ' it was sadly and unbeknown to her at the time of her exposure to dust and protein emulated by @entity7 that brought about her death			2
' it would be an unnatural occurring disease process , the only factor to bear in mind is whether she was particularly susceptible , i do feel that her death was by reason of the lung disease @entity225			2
