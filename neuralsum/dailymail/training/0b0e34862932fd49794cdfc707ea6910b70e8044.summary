early reference : @entity2 poet and novelist sir @entity1 wrote of the sound ' boo ' in 1830 it 's the word most commonly associated with giving people a fright - and after extensive research it seems @entity2 can now claim it as their own			1
a new linguistics study has revealed that the word ' boo ' is most likely to have originated in the country after its earliest reference was found in the religious works of two @entity2 writers in the 18th century			1
its first recorded use comes in the @entity20 , written by @entity21 and @entity22 under the pseudonym of @entity24 in 1738			2
it is defined as ' a word that 's used in the north of @entity2 to frighten crying children '			1
@entity2 poet and novelist sir @entity1 also made reference to the sound in his series of essays titled @entity35 on @entity36 and @entity37 from 1830			1
he wrote ' we start and are afraid when we hear one cry @entity40 ! ' defining it as an ' an exclamation intended to surprise or frighten '			0
the @entity43 ( @entity43 ) says ' bo ' or ' boh ' comes from the sixteenth century , but its exact sense is not always clear			0
@entity46 , a linguist from @entity47 , who works on the origins of @entity50 , said : ' there is a tendency to consider words like this as slang and unimportant , and not to trace their origins			0
' the @entity43 gives the etymology of " bo " as " a combination of consonant and vowel especially fitted to produce a loud and startling sound "			0
' however , different words are used in different languages - for example , @entity62 ghosts say " hou " , so it should be possible to trace the origins of individual words			0
scary : the 18th and 19th centuries were the heyday of ghost stories like @entity73 ' @entity72 , pictured ' since it appears that @entity2 ghosts were the first to say " boo " , it would be really interesting to find where this word came from			1
' if it does come from the north of @entity2 , then it might come from @entity82			1
' gaelic ghosts do say boo , but we do n't know if the @entity82 came from the @entity2 or the @entity2 from the @entity82			2
' @entity46 added : ' there is very little data to go on			0
i 'd be interested to know what @entity2 - or @entity82 - speaking ghosts from the 18th or 19th century would have to say about this			2

first reference appears in @entity2 religious book published in 1738
defined it as ' word used in north of @entity2 to frighten crying children '
sir @entity1 also used word in series of *supernatural* essays in 1830
