by @entity0 as @entity3 's left - foot strike hit the back of the net in @entity6 , it was an end and a beginning			1
it was the end of a long wait for this group of players to finally crown their talent with a major trophy			2
it was the end of speculation that the golden generation might have been wasted			1
it was the beginning of what may well be a period of dominance			2
@entity21 had predicted it even before the final			0
' we have a future , ' he said , ' we can play on top of the world for a few years yet			0
' he is almost certainly right			0
of the team which beat @entity30 at the @entity31 , only @entity28 will not be around for very much longer			0
even he will not be a terrible loss for @entity33			1
but in truth , @entity28 has played only a secondary role for a while now			0
this team is built on youth			0
age is not merely a number either			0
those lining up to replace @entity28 are not only considerably younger , they also belong to a much more modern breed of attacker			0
@entity33 has a gliding false nine in @entity3 , a poaching one in @entity58 , and a incredibly quick one in @entity59			1
all of those three are 25 or younger , and their best years are yet to come			2
they are also only the tip of the iceberg in terms of the attacking talent @entity21 is able to choose from			0
in the next few years , we will almost certainly see the rise of players like @entity70 and @entity71 , who were on the fringes of the preliminary squad this year , while @entity74 is becoming ever more established			2
@entity75 : the @entity77 shirt with a fourth star above the badge to mark their latest success on top of the world : @entity33 ended their 24 - year wait to win football 's biggest prize we are the champions : @entity33 's newspapers react to their team 's triumph in @entity92 @entity94 's team profile & qualifying highlights in midfield , too , there is an almost endless supply of talent			1
the likes of @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 all have years ahead of them , but already a wealth of experience behind them			1
even if @entity101 's fitness and age become a problem over the next few years , there are plenty of understudies waiting to fill his shoes			1
@entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 's @entity116 are all capable of reaching the top of the international game , and @entity122 should return to full fitness in the near future			1
only in defence are there any long term problems for @entity33			1
while young @entity129 left back @entity130 will have gained invaluable experience as part of this @entity37 squad , there are no truly remarkable young defensive talents emerging at the moment			1
life : @entity137 ( left ) , @entity138 ( centre ) and @entity103 ( right ) are all still young with plenty to offer leader : @entity77 manager @entity21 said the future is bright for his team , even before their win on sunday nonetheless , @entity137 and @entity146 are still young			1
@entity147 may be 30 , but even he is showing no signs of stopping			0
even beyond the current team , everything seems set for @entity21 and his employers at the moment			0
in the last 10 to 15 years , @entity77 football has completely restructured itself			2
it is not just the @entity156 , but the league and the clubs themselves			0
in the @entity161 , the clubs who develop their own players are the successful ones			0
that is visible from the heights of @entity129 down to lowly @entity165 , who have been punching above their weight for years due to a brilliant youth system which spawned , among others , @entity171 's @entity170			1
nurtured : @entity170 came through the ranks at @entity165 and now plays for @entity171 video @entity174 fans in tears as @entity33 clinch title as long as clubs like @entity165 continue to play in a league which encourages that youth development , they will continue to produce top talents to represent @entity33 , and we will see many more golden generations			1
the main reason for this @entity77 team 's success is not national pride or machine - like efficiency , as some in @entity188 continue to insist			2
the reason is that this young group of players has been allowed to thrive from a very young age			0
they have played together or against each other from a very young age			0
even those who are under 25 now have an immense amount of experience			2
there is no reason to believe that wo n't be the case for the next @entity77 generation , and the next one , and the one after that			2
@entity204 – @entity205 – @entity207 - @entity206 – 25 @entity208 – @entity209 – @entity210 – @entity211 – @entity212 – @entity213 – @entity214 – @entity215 - 30 @entity102 – @entity216 – @entity217 – @entity218 – @entity219 – @entity220 – 23 @entity3 – @entity221 – @entity222 – @entity223 – @entity224 - 23 video world champions @entity33 prepare for journey home			1

@entity33 's @entity37 win ended a 24 - year wait for football 's biggest prize
@entity233 was also the beginning of a golden generation for @entity33
@entity58 , @entity3 , @entity103 , @entity138 and @entity170 all still under 25 and have plenty left to give on the international stage
