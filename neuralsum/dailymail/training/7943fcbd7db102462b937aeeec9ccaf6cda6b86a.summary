by @entity1 reporter most experienced motorists might struggle to pass the driving test if they had to take it now , according to a survey			1
a total of 50 experienced drivers took a test in an experiment organised by car insurance company @entity10 , with more than three quarters of them failing			1
those who failed recorded an average of three serious or dangerous faults , with one participant committing ten major faults			1
one experienced motorist who took part in the experiment organised by @entity21 committed 10 major faults during their mock driving test just one major fault , or more than 15 minor faults , can fail a candidate			1
in the mock test , the experienced drivers who failed committed an average of 16 minor faults , with one driver recording as many as 42			1
one motorist drove at 40mph in a 30mph zone , and another failed to see the kerb when doing a three - point turn			0

the vast majority of drivers were awarded minor faults for a lack of concentration behind the wheel and a lack of control over the vehicle , most commonly using the wrong gear and failing to check their mirrors			2
one driver received 14 minor points for misuse of gears			0
the majority of motorists who participated in the study run by @entity21 failed to pay proper attention to the road @entity10 said complacent driving and a lack of concentration at the wheel could be caused by an over-reliance on in - car driving aids , such as parking sensors or blind spot monitors			2

@entity10 's motor director @entity78 said : " while drivers gain experience with age , it 's easy to pick up bad habits that could be potentially dangerous and put other road users at risk			0
' driving aids are becoming increasingly common and when used correctly , can result in a safer , more - comfortable driving experience			0
' however , it 's important that drivers do n't rely too heavily on these aids , as it can be to the detriment of both their overall ability and concentration on the road ahead			0
