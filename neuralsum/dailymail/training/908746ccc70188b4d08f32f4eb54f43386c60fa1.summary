@entity1 drug kingpin @entity0 , who is facing death by firing squad in @entity4 , masterminded another international heroin smuggling attempt out of @entity6 - but the operation failed , resulting in three young @entity8 being jailed			1
@entity9 can reveal for the first time that @entity0 enlisted @entity12 teenager @entity11 , 17 , and @entity13 , 15 , both from western @entity12 , as drug couriers to smuggle $ 1 million worth of heroin in condoms , which they were to swallow in @entity6 and bring back to @entity8			1
the @entity6 deal was to run at the same time as the @entity1 operation - when @entity0 , @entity20 and seven @entity8 mules were arrested , some with the drugs strapped to their bodies			1
it can also be revealed that after his own arrest , @entity0 wrote a letter to @entity11 in @entity6 , ordering her to keep her mouth shut			1
they could face death by firing squad in coming months			2
@entity0 , who @entity4 police called ' @entity30 ' when they arrested him , was a key organiser of the @entity8 end of the smuggling and distribution network , which was detailed in the @entity6 court during @entity11 's trial and described as a ' predatory crime syndicate '			1
in just two weeks in april 2005 , the syndicate was responsible for the arrest , and later the incarceration , of 17 young @entity8 for heroin trafficking in three countries			1

they were found with 114 condoms filled with up to 1kg of heroin - but @entity11 had had second thoughts about taking part in the operation , for which they were to be paid $ 200 for each 5cm - long condom they ingested			1
@entity11 's father @entity99 failed to get his daughter released on bail and 12 months after her arrest , she was sentenced to 10 years and eight months			2
@entity13 , by then 16 , received nine years , and @entity85 got 13 years and four months			0
all have since been released , with @entity11 serving out the majority of her sentence in a @entity106 women 's prison after being transferred in february 2009 under the @entity107			0

the seven couriers recruited by @entity0 and @entity43 have all received sentences ranging from 18 years to life			0
predator : death row inmate @entity0 , who claims he would serve @entity121 as a pastor if he was set free , was a cynical drug trafficker who landed at least 17 young @entity8 in jail before his arrest no way back : @entity112 , aged 19 , at @entity126 on april 17 , 2005 , as @entity32 police remove packages of heroin strapped to his body several trips : panel beater turned drug mule @entity110 made two successful trips for @entity0 from @entity32 with heroin strapped to her body but was caught on the third , in april 2005 , and sentenced to 20 years young dupes : former @entity138 bartender , @entity111 ( left ) and @entity12 catering worker @entity114 ( right ) , pictured at @entity139 , @entity32 , in 2007 , two years after they were duped by @entity0 who had promised them quick riches by acting as heroin mules in @entity32 behind closed doors : lured to this hotel in @entity6 's @entity147 district by a drug gang which preyed on young @entity8 , @entity11 , 17 , and @entity13 , 15 , were arrested with 1kg of heroin in condoms both the @entity1 and the @entity6 drug smuggling deals were connected with a third , lesser - known attempted heroin importation in which @entity0 and @entity43 conspired with four young @entity154 people			1
@entity9 can also reveal that in the lead up to the @entity1 and the @entity6 operations @entity0 and @entity43 visited a young @entity157 - @entity8 who was later arrested and charged over the @entity6 conspiracy following the arrest of @entity11 , @entity13 and @entity85			1
a @entity157 - @entity8 and a co-conspirator were charged with plotting to import the packages of heroin that @entity11 and 15 - year - old @entity13 were meant to swallow			2
the @entity1 are a group of nine @entity8 who attempted to smuggle 8.3kg of heroin from @entity32 to @entity8 on august 17 , 2005			0

with prison remission , @entity176 's current earliest possible release date is february 2026			0
@entity0 visited the @entity157 - @entity8 at least three times in different @entity106 prisons and once with @entity43 in late 2004 , just before the two made two ' practice ' runs to @entity4 with several of the future @entity1 couriers , including @entity110 , and successfully returned to @entity8 with heroin strapped to their bodies			2
@entity0 , who was a manager at a @entity12 catering company , duped three of his staff - @entity176 , @entity114 and @entity111 - into becoming mules , promising them thousands of dollars in return			0
following the arrests in @entity6 and @entity32 within days of each other - and a series of other arrests in @entity12 and @entity154 just days later - police said the @entity1 had no connection with the @entity11 case			2
however , detectives have exclusively revealed that @entity0 was in contact with @entity11 for months and all three trafficking deals were connected to a @entity12 - based @entity208 drug smuggling syndicate which had links to @entity210			2
@entity0 , who has found @entity121 in prison , was regularly visiting another convicted drug dealer in prison as he was conspiring to commit the @entity1 deal			2

@entity11 , a trainee hairdresser with churchgoing @entity221 migrant parents , and @entity13 , a @entity222 's worker and son of a single mother of @entity226 origin , came from modest income families in western @entity12			1
neither had previously known connections with drug syndicates , nor had they met before they flew out from @entity12 to @entity6 in april 2005			0
@entity11 's parents , @entity99 and @entity232 , believed she was having a sleep - over at a friend 's house and then reported her missing when she failed to return			0
squalor and misery : @entity8 inmates @entity113 , @entity116 and @entity114 in a holding cell before a court appearance at @entity126 greedy fool : @entity43 ( pictured arriving at court to appeal his death sentence ) admits his role in the @entity1 drug deal just because he wanted an easy life with cars , money and women on the day she and @entity13 were due home , april 13 , police believe the @entity157 - @entity8 went to @entity253 to collect them , armed with three packets of laxatives			1
@entity11 and @entity13 were in a room at the @entity258 , in @entity260 's @entity147 backpacker district , with the 114 heroin - filled condoms , supplied by @entity85 , when police burst in			1
@entity13 was prepared to swallow 30 packages but @entity11 had apparently reconsidered , realising they could burst inside her stomach during the eight - hour flight back to @entity12			2
fearful place : @entity6 's notorious @entity269 correctional facility where @entity11 was incarcerated before being transferred to a @entity12 prison firing squad : after a series of court appeals , @entity43 ( left ) and @entity0 are the sole remaining members of the @entity1 who still face death by an @entity4 firing squad earliest possible release : with prison governor 's remissions , @entity1 drug smuggler @entity110 will be the first of the group to gain freedom , in february 2026 at the earliest meanwhile , four @entity8 from @entity154 - aged 24 , 22 , 18 , and 19 , had been arrested in @entity154 and charged with conspiring with @entity0 and @entity43 of conspiring to import heroin to @entity8			1
a fifth , @entity286 , 24 , was arrested in @entity12			0
@entity286 subsequently pleaded guilty , but said he was only a ' runaround ' in the gang whose members included @entity43 , and was never paid but did it for the ' glamour ' and entries to parties and clubs			0
