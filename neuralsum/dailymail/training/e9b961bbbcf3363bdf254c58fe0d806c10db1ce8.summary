i ’d like to thank the victim of this robbery for his diligence in phoning police on 999 at the earliest opportunity and having already installed and enabled the tracker app on his phone prior to the theft			1

' faced with the overwhelming evidence @entity1 realised he had no option but to enter a guilty plea			2
' @entity55 said he was happy with the lengthy sentence dished out to @entity1			2
he said : ' @entity1 had only been released from prison on licence a couple of weeks before carrying out this robbery , having served one year of a two year sentence for a knife point robbery just streets away the previous year			1
' by carrying out a similar offence , he has shown a complete disregard for the criminal justice system and for the right of law abiding members of the public to go about their business without fear			0

' help us to help you			0
search the internet for theft recovery apps or software and see which ones people recommend			0

' only last week my officers arrested someone on suspicion of handling stolen goods after the victim of a theft presented police with photos of someone using their stolen macbook and location information			1
' ' i urge people to install and activate an appropriate tracker service on their device			0
importantly , also set a lock code so that a thief ca n’t de-activate the tracker while they try to make their escape			0
' ' register any serial numbers of valuable electrical items onto the immobilise.com database free of charge , as this also helps us to return stolen property to its rightful owner and to catch the people that help drive theft by their involvement in handling stolen goods			0
' remember , if you ’re set to get a new phone , tablet or computer in the coming months , make sure you re-install any tracker or anti-theft software onto it			0
