it 's a dog ’s life for the nation ’s mutts – who are becoming anxious and aggressive through lack of play , experts fear			0
a study of 4,000 dog owners has found a clear link between limited playtime and behaviour problems , such as being nervous when left alone , disobedience and snapping at other animals			1

tennis balls were the favourite toys , followed by soft , squeaky toys , rubber balls and rope toys			1
the research comes just days after an animal charity warned that millions of dogs are becoming fat , aggressive and destructive because their owners are clueless about basic animal care			2
the @entity99 said that treats including beer , chips and leftover takeaways are making dogs fat and unwell – and warned that almost a million are never taken for a walk .			0
