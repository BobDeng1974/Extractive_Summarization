the deputy leader of the opposition has made a passionate plea for the lives of the @entity4 ringleaders on death row in @entity6 to be spared by highlighting her own husband 's drug reform story			1
@entity11 's husband @entity10 was convicted of conspiracy to import drugs in 1986 , at the age of 21 , and served three years of a nine - year prison sentence			1
he has turned his life around and is now secretary of the @entity19 @entity18			2
meanwhile , @entity21 men @entity22 and @entity23 , are due to face a firing squad this month after they were convicted of heroin trafficking in @entity6 in 2006			1
' in 1988 , my husband left prison after being charged and convicted of a similar crime to these young men			2
i imagine what would have happened if he had been caught in @entity43 instead of in @entity44 where that crime was committed , where he was coming back to @entity44 , ' ms @entity11 said in @entity47 on thursday			1
' i think about – i did n't know him at the time , this is 30 years ago – what would the world have missed out on ? they would have missed out on the three beautiful children we have had together			0
they would have missed out on a man who spent the rest of his life making amends for the crime that he committed , ' she added			0
despite lawyers arguing they are reformed men and mounting international pressure against their execution , @entity6 's president has refused to grant @entity22 and @entity67 pardons			1
legal appeals against their sentence have also repeatedly been quashed			0
@entity22 and @entity23 have been in an @entity6 jail since 2006 and are facing execution in the next month ' we need to have a principled and methodical approach to punishments of serious crime			1
i perhaps have a particular view on remorse and redemption because of experiences in my own life			0

i think about – i did n’t know him at the time , this is 30 years ago – what would the world have missed out on ? they would have missed out on the three beautiful children we have had together			0
they would have missed out on a man who spent the rest of his life making amends for the crime that he committed			0
i have another perspective on this , too			0
in 1997 , i lost my brother to a violent crime in @entity105			0
i know that if i had been the one making the decision about the punishment of the person who did that crime , i could n’t have thought of a punishment bad enough			0
that ’s why we do n’t make decisions about punishment on the basis of how we feel but on the basis of universal , consistently - applied rules			0
i think it is important to say that when it comes to the death penalty , there has been for many years in @entity44 a bipartisan rejection of the death penalty			0
' deputy opposition leader @entity11 speaks in the @entity124 at @entity125 in @entity126 , thursday , february 12 mr @entity10 , now a high - level public servant , said in a statement to @entity129 his experience was no where near as difficult as that faced by @entity22 and @entity23 or their families and he does n't want to disrespect them by suggesting otherwise			1
' like a great many @entity44 i oppose the death penalty , ' he said			0
' these two young men have done serious wrong and should be punished with substantial gaol terms			0
but they should be granted mercy and not death			2
' alive in gaol @entity22 and @entity23 have the chance – and the obligation - to make amends and regain their dignity by serving others			1
and their families have the chance to love and support them to do so			0
' from all reports , they would work their lives through to repay that generosity , ' mr @entity10 reasoned			2
' i was afforded a second chance by our @entity44 justice system			0
i remain grateful for that every day			0
' the couple have ' three beautiful children ' together , seen here at the @entity160 premier in march , 2014 ms @entity11 spoke in parliament in support of foreign minister @entity163 , who says the execution of the @entity166 nine ringleaders would be a grave injustice			1
an emotional ms @entity163 also made a speech in parliament on thursday to plead for the lives of @entity22 and @entity23			1
@entity44 was not seeking to understate the gravity of their crimes , but the death penalty was a bridge too far , she said			0
' this motion goes to the heart of what we believe will be a grave injustice against two @entity44 citizens facing execution in @entity6 , ' she told the lower house			2
' without doubt , @entity22 and @entity23 need to pay for their crimes with lengthy jail sentences but they should not need to pay with their lives			1
' deputy opposition leader @entity11 spoke out in a bid to help the @entity4 pair mr @entity10 has turned his life around and is now secretary of the @entity19 @entity18 ms @entity11 said capital punishment ' barbarised ' the executioner , while speaking in parliament ms @entity163 said more than 30,000 @entity44 have implored the @entity6 president and members of the @entity6 government for a stay of their executions			1
her shared hope with those petitioners was for the @entity6 government to show mercy , she said			1
' i believe it is @entity6 that will lose the most from executing these two young men , ' she said			2
no country had done as much as @entity44 to support @entity6 in fighting drug - related crime , ms @entity163 said			1
ms @entity11 said capital punishment ' barbarised ' the executioner			1
' it 's left over from an earlier and more barbaric time , ' she said			2
