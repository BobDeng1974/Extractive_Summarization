in the light of recent news that a @entity4 firm had created a 230 calorie @entity5 that you can drink , @entity0 felt duty bound to try it out			1
our verdict ? it may be low fat , low cal and have what the firm describe as a ' powerful , distinctive and appealing ' taste ... but it looks like vomit			1
if you were thinking of stocking up on these as a @entity19 party hangover cure , think again			0
it 's the sort of drink that could prompt a full - scale relapse if you 're feeling a bit delicate			1
trial run : the firm 's flavour kitchen has produced a batch of the liquid fry up drink to gauge reaction and understand whether it will be a commercial proposition proof is in the pudding : bosses at @entity34 admitted that whether people like the taste of the fry up drink very much depends on personal taste - and we would agree duty called though , so i gave the drink a sniff			1
thankfully , it has barely any aroma , and the faint whiff it does have is not at all unpleasant			0
think of the smell of a piece of chewed up toast - kind of sweet , and a bit carby			1
but as the pale orange liquid rippled out of the mouth of the container into the cup , i watched in horror as foul - looking bobbly bits bumped and flowed over the carton 's rim			1
my stomach convulsed with every one			0
it reminded me of the time my twin sister got car sick after eating a bag of @entity66 and the resulting rubbery clusters pinged and bounced around the back seat			0
that all - too - vivid memory coupled with the sensation of the vomity bobbles as they clung to my lips on the way in was enough to set off my sensitive gag reflex , which had sprung to attention as soon as i opened the carton			1
tasty treat : the liquid fry up is being developed as the perfect and fast breakfast on the go for the chisel - jawed action man			1
right , reality bites as the drink is poured into a cup for tasting the drink , which did taste essentially like a fry - up milkshake , had no chance			1
its cloying , meaty sweetness clung to the back of my tongue			0
it was one of the most unwelcome things i have ever had in my mouth , and i have eaten everything from lamb 's testicles and tongue to mealworms and grasshoppers			2
let 's be fair though			2
i am neither the target audience nor the most ideal guinea pig			0
the liquid fry - up and i were never destined to be culinary soulmates			1
i like poached eggs with grilled vine tomatoes , a few slices of avocado and sourdough toast for my breakfast			2
i would never eat or drink anything that contained mystery ingredients , anything with a chemical compound i could n't pronounce ( unless it was a @entity119 ) , or anything with an even remotely ' meal replacement ' vibe			2
so what did one of my , ahem , less fussy colleagues , @entity127 - dubbed @entity126 by peers - make of the liquid fry - up ? for starters , despite saying it looked ' f * * * * * * disgusting ' , he downed the whole cup			1
already way ahead of me			0
but although he has got a stomach of iron and seemed not to flinch at the bobbly bits , in a rare moment of self - control , he refused to go back for more			2
' it ’s not often that i ’d turn down the offer of a full @entity141 breakfast – but this is probably one of those times , ' he said afterwards			2
' with the consistency and appeal of a soggy bowl of cornflakes , the drink is sweet , filling and good for those on a diet – because one mouthful is plenty			1
' i asked him if it turned his stomach			0
' no , but then not a lot does , ' he said			0
high praise there then ... but , ever eager to give products a fair trial , i sought out another victim sorry , i mean guinea pig , to test the fry - up			1
victim # 2 , @entity164 , was less diplomatic			0
' it tastes like sweet , milky sick , ' he said ( a man after my own heart )			2
' it looks like has tiny bits of satsuma floating in the top , and has a nasty oily sheen to boot			0
' a third victim admitted that it was n't the best thing they 'd ever drunk , but it ' definitely tasted of bacon and eggs ' , ' was n't that bad ' and they would ' definitely down it to get through to lunch '			2
a win ! with that though , the rest of the liquid fry - up had to go the way of the bin			1
maybe the chisel - jawed action men it 's targeted at will like it better than we did			2
sorry chaps ! tucking into a full @entity141 breakfast is a favourite for millions ... but now a @entity4 firm claims to have captured all the flavours in a drink , with a third of the calories			1
in the mix are the tastes of two rashers of streaky bacon , one grilled @entity207 , a poached egg , two fried tomatoes , baked beans , mushrooms , brown toast , salt , pepper and brown sauce			1
fuel , behind more recognisable breakfast drink flavours such as chocolate and latte , insists the ingredients have been distilled rather than pulped into a runny gloop			1
as a result , each 330ml carton has about 6g of fat and 230 calories			2
even a relatively modest fry - up would clock up 37g of fat with 618 calories			1
fuel co-founder @entity229 said : ‘ it will not be for everyone , but for people who do like the flavour notes of a fry - up , i think it ’s great			1
if it gets a positive reaction , then it will go into production			0
’ the company already has fuel liquid breakfast cartons on the shelves of the likes of @entity243 , @entity244 and @entity245 ’s , which come in less alarming chocolate , strawberry or caramel latte flavours			1
just as busy @entity4 have given up on eating breakfast at the kitchen table in favour of cereal bars munched on the daily commute , so the new drinks could take the place of bacon and eggs			2
mr @entity229 said his team have tested more than 500 fry up combinations to develop what they believe is a powerful , distinctive and appealing taste			1
‘ we have taken about six months , testing hundreds of recipe combinations to get to this point , ’ he said			0
breakfast time : scientists have extracted infusions of flavours from a real fry up and added them to a milk base taste test : ' @entity273 ' gives the breakfast potion a try ‘ what we have done is extract infusions of flavours from a real fry up , rather than blending up bacon and sausages which turns in to a bit of a lumpy mush			1
‘ the flavours have been mixed with a milk base , where we have added protein , fibre and vitamins			0
it is a bit like the clever techniques used by @entity293 to make his ice cream			0
’ at the moment , the firm ’s flavour kitchen has produced a batch of the liquid fry up drink to gauge reaction and understand whether it will be a commercial proposition			1
‘ if people like it , we will take it on to the next level , ’ he said			0
‘ the drink has a good level of protein , but we are not selling this as a muscle - building product			1
' rather the idea is that it is sufficiently tasty and filling that it will carry someone through until lunch			0
he added : ‘ we have managed to keep it below one per cent fat and we think it will be around 200 - 230 calories , which is a reasonable level for what is a meal replacement product			1
’ the company has carried out market research to identify a target market			0
domestic goddess : the company has created a spoof @entity331 video featuring a character called ' @entity273 ' to promote the idea ‘ there is a big group of breakfast skippers between the ages of 17 and 35			1
they tend to be more male than female			0
people who roll out of bed , cycle into work and maybe grab a coffee and have something at their desk , ’ he said			0
‘ you could almost call them the @entity352 brigade who do n’t take breakfast seriously			0
it is trying to help them with different breakfast formats that are convenient , portable and re-sealable			0
at the same time , they get quite a good dose of nutrients without even thinking about it			0
’ the company has created a spoof @entity331 video featuring a character called ‘ @entity273 ’ to promote the idea			2
fuel was founded by mr @entity229 and friend @entity368 18 months ago and began selling the breakfast drinks in april this year			2
the drinks sell for £ 1.49 and are free of @entity371 because they are sold as a food , rather than a sports nutrition product			0
mr @entity229 is something of an extreme sports enthusiast , while the 39 year - old ’s exploits include a two week 220 - mile trek through the @entity379 jungle			0
mr @entity368 is a former tank commander in the @entity4 army .			0
