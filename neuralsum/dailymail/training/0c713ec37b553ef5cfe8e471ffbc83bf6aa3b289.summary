experts say there is a link between rural living and the disease – and people raised in the country , rather than those who moved there later in life , face the greatest dangers			1
however , the reasons for this remain a mystery , they said			0
distressing : @entity20 's patients make suffer short term memory loss and confusion ( picture posed by model ) dr @entity24 , from the @entity25 at the @entity26 , who led the study , said : ‘ we do n’t really know the mechanism			1
‘ it could be to do with access to healthcare , exposure to some unknown substance , socio - economic factors , or a number of other factors			1
’ he added : ‘ we ’re currently looking into this question in more detail			0
’ previous studies have looked at how the disease rates vary between urban and rural areas , but the results have been inconclusive due to different definitions of what constitutes city or country life			1
to get a clearer picture , researchers from the @entity26 , the @entity48 and @entity49 pooled the results of dozens of studies from all over the world dating back several decades , in a process known as a meta - analysis			0
this was designed to give a better overall indication of the risks and benefits of lifestyle and its influence on alzheimer ’s disease			0
their results , published in the @entity65 , showed that being born and brought up in the country more than doubled the risk of alzheimer ’s disease later in life			2
there was a much smaller increase in risk in other forms of dementia			2
stunning : but the tranquility of rural countryside living may increase your risk of developing @entity20 's @entity20 ’s is the most common form of dementia , affecting an estimated 820,000 @entity81			1
the number of sufferers is expected to more than double in the next 40 years as the elderly population increases			1
one of the main symptoms of @entity20 ’s is loss of short - term memory , meaning sufferers may recall things that happened decades ago , but struggle to remember events of the past few days			2
other signs of the disease include lack of concentration , confusion and a tendency to wander aimlessly			0
in the final stages , patients often lose the ability to move , speak or even swallow			0
the researchers said they now plan to investigate the reason for the link , in the hope of finding a way to protect against the risks			0
‘ any attempts at prevention will need to begin sufficiently early in life , ’ they said .			0

people raised in rural areas face the greatest risk of brain wasting disease
cause is *unclear* but may be linked to access to healthcare or even exposure to an unknown substance
@entity20 's , the most common form of dementia affects an estimated 820,000 people in @entity81
the number of people suffering from the disease is expected to more than double in the next 40 years
