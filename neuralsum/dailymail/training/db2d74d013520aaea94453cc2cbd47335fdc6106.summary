by @entity0 published : 11:18 est , 27 november 2012 updated : 19:50 est , 27 november 2012 a psychiatric patient warned repeatedly that she would hurt someone shortly before stabbing a girl of 13 to death at random , a report revealed yesterday			2
@entity6 , 26 , was ‘ almost invisible ’ and her predictions that she would attack someone fell on deaf ears			1
in total 16 psychiatrists and 20 community workers were involved in her care over the years			1
@entity6 , who was jailed for a minimum of 22 years , was ' almost invisible ' to some groups , despite being in and out of mental health care since 2002 they and mental health nurses ‘ missed opportunities ’ to help @entity6 and change her life for the better , said a damning independent review of her treatment			1
it highlighted bad decisions , inept leadership , inadequate information - sharing and an ‘ overly - optimistic ’ attitude by the professionals			2
@entity6 was jailed for a minimum of 22 years at @entity29 in july after being convicted of murdering @entity30 , a total stranger			1
the drug - addicted loner plunged a kitchen knife into the teenager ’s chest without warning as she walked through a park in @entity37 on the way to a half - term sleepover with a friend			2
@entity6 , whose mental health problems were linked to years of cannabis abuse , had been involved with care agencies for 19 years because of a troubled upbringing			1
as her mental state worsened in the weeks before the murder , she repeatedly warned she could be a danger			2
she told two charity workers who assessed her at home she had a ‘ short fuse and anger issues ’			2
she warned that she was a danger to others and one day would ‘ blow up ’			0
however , the housing charity staff failed to share the information with mental health workers involved in her treatment and concluded there had been ‘ no direct threats ’ to herself or another person			0
stabbed at random : @entity30 was stabbed to death in a park after @entity6 was allowed to remain free @entity6 also told hospital staff she was ‘ criminally insane ’ and was going to harm herself or someone else			1
she said she needed to be locked up			0
three days later she told a psychiatrist that ‘ seven people were trapped inside her body ’ adding that ‘ some of them were psychopathic , some looked down on people , some do not like children ’			0
despite these warnings she was allowed to return to her flat and was visited by a ‘ home treatment team ’			0
on january 16 , less than a month before the @entity79 murder , @entity6 told a mental health nurse she should not be around other people because she wanted to kill them			1
she said she had bad thoughts every day and therefore tried to stay away from people on the street			0
incredibly , the home treatment team ‘ discharged ’ @entity6 from its care two weeks later when there was evidence her condition had actually deteriorated			1
the independent inquiry concluded that this showed she was not being ‘ listened to ’			2
it criticised the constant changing of psychiatrists and the failure of anyone to take the lead in her care			0
one consultant psychiatrist involved in the final key period was accused of assessment and care planning ‘ significantly below acceptable standards ’			0
there was ‘ no robust care plan ’ drawn up as her condition worsened alarmingly , said the report , which did not name any of the culprits			0
jailed : @entity6 was told she must serve a minimum of 22 years in jail when she was sentenced at @entity29 ( pictured ) @entity6 was referred to as ‘ @entity109 ’ in the 146 - page report written by professor @entity111 , a senior @entity112 official			1
‘ everybody knew a little about @entity116 , but nobody had the full picture , ’ he said			0
professor @entity111 studied the actions of ten agencies and made 21 recommendations			2
although he made it clear that @entity6 was responsible for @entity30 ’s death , he concluded : ‘ she told many agencies of her concern that she was going to harm someone			1
‘ assessments made by them did not identify a high level of risk of this occurring			0
’ @entity6 told professor @entity111 she felt people ‘ did not listen or take her seriously ’ and that she ‘ asked to be locked up as she was afraid that she might hurt someone ’			1
@entity6 said ‘ professional egos got in the way of providing the help she needed and she was always sent home ’			1
@entity143 , chief executive of @entity144 and @entity145 , said action had been taken to implement the recommendations			0
‘ we acknowledge that our service to @entity150 should have been much better			0
