taken during the twilight hours , a @entity1 photographer has gone to extraordinary lengths to get the perfect shot including climbing rooftops , hanging from helicopters and even entering restricted military areas			1
and @entity9 's dedication to his work has enabled him to put together a portfolio showcasing the beauty of some of the world 's most famous cities by night			1
each of the series of spectacular shots captures the pulsing energy of its location through vivid light trails			0
whether it is the bright lights of the @entity50 skyline , the winding bridges of @entity32 , or the wispy reflections of @entity44 's harbour , each of @entity9 's photographs reveal a beautiful side to the urban sprawl			1
by using a specially adapted camera that shoots at a whopping 80 mega pixels per image , the @entity1 photographer is able to capture huge city landscapes in extraordinary detail			2
constantly on the move , @entity9 is continuously travelling in an effort to add new locations to his already impressive portfolio			2
then @entity50 skyline is perhaps one of the more noticeable landscapes from @entity9 's work behind the scenes of @entity69 shoot in @entity32 ; the photographer has spent three years collating his work each of the series of spectacular shots captures the pulsing energy of its location through vivid light trails ; here the lights of @entity78 reflect in the waters @entity9 said : ' some of my images require a lot of planning , unfortunately , one of the ways i decided to get a different view was to get onto rooftops			1
' some with full permissions and authorised access , others less so			0
' ironically , while legitimate access takes a lot of bureaucracy , it 's the more ' unofficial ' shoots which take the most planning			0
' generally if you search online , or see a city in a magazine , the same old shots will appear time and time again , so while i use other images for reference , i tend to then start researching using tools like @entity106 satellite view and 3d maps along with sunrise / sunset apps to plan my own take on the view of a city			0
the serene and still waters reflect the bright lights of @entity44 , a hive of activity a gorgeous sunset of the golden gate bridge , @entity116 reveals a beautiful side to the urban sprawl the roads may be devoid of traffic here in @entity124 , but it simply gives the light trails more prominence ' the shot of the @entity129 in @entity32 was the most difficult shot to take of the collection , while hanging from helicopters and lying in the middle of roads sounds challenging , photographically this was a real pain			2
' let 's just say you need to trust the front half of your feet to get to the place , as that 's the only part which will be touching the ledge of a building as you walk along it 30 - odd storeys up in the air			0
the shimmering @entity144 skyline in @entity145 looks majestic against the backdrop of the dark waters the buildings of @entity124 look palatial , and show off in terrific lighting by @entity9 's camera skills @entity9 captures the jam - packed nature of @entity50 from high above most of the buildings ' i 've had to run from some locations with a memory card in my underwear before now ! not because of anything illegal , more an argument with an overzealous security guard on a building i was photographing from			1
' because of the resolution of these images , they can be printed big and when you see a cityscape at two or three meters wide and are able to see every detail of every parked car , building window or landmark in the distance , it 's quite impressive			0
' the @entity32 interchanges are mesmerising , and only at night would you ever see them this quiet @entity176 , @entity177 ; the @entity1 photographer is able to capture huge city landscapes in extraordinary detail			1
