the @entity0 was launched by @entity1 after his wife @entity3 died from ovarian cancer a new law allowing dying patients to be treated with untested medicines has moved a step closer after the government backed the plan			1
the @entity0 aims to give legal protection to doctors who try out different procedures or treatments when they have exhausted other options			1
the @entity16 was launched by conservative peer @entity1 after his wife @entity3 died from ovarian cancer			1
now health secretary @entity19 has thrown his department 's weight behind a backbench bill which will be debated in @entity23 this week			0
a change in the law would allow doctors to try other treatments deemed reasonable , providing they are approved by a panel of medical specialists and either the patient or their representative			2
the idea is that it would help overcome the problem of doctors only being covered legally to offer standard treatments – even in cases where it is clear that standard procedures will lead to poor life quality and the death of the patient			2
currently , if a doctor deviates from standard treatments , they could face the threat of legal action			2
writing in @entity47 , dr @entity48 , a @entity49 doctor , journalist and author , said : ' worryingly , while doctors know that evidence - based medicine is not always the best choice for treating their patients , they have , in recent years , become increasingly scared of deviating from the standard treatments available to them , even if these do n’t appear to be working			1
' the legislation will have its detailed committee stage debate on friday and the @entity67 said @entity1 had tabled amendments adding extra safeguards to the @entity16			1
the peer told the @entity47 : ' in dealing with the deadly @entity73 outbreak , the @entity71 has decided that departure from standard evidence - based treatment is fully justified and essential			0
health secretary @entity19 ( pictured ) is backing a bill that would allow dying patients to be treated with untested medicines			1
the @entity0 aims to give legal protection to doctors who try out different procedures or treatments when they have exhausted other options the @entity0 is designed to allow dying patients to be treated with untested medicines in a bid to save their lives when tried - and - tested drugs have failed			1
it also aims to give legal protection to doctors who try out different procedures or treatments when they have exhausted other options			1
the @entity16 was launched by conservative peer @entity1 two years ago after his wife @entity3 died from ovarian cancer			1
now health secretary @entity19 has thrown his department 's weight behind the @entity16 , which will be debated in parliament next week			2
it has been supported by experts such as sir @entity99 , president of the @entity100 , who said : ' the @entity101 will allow responsible innovation '			0
professor @entity103 , professor of @entity104 at the @entity105 , believes the bill will deter irresponsible experimentation , while encouraging innovation in the care of cancer patients			0
the @entity110 and @entity111 had concerns about the original version of the @entity16 , but after amendments were added , they are largely positive , @entity47 reported			2
but @entity115 , professor @entity116 at @entity118 , said : ' changing the law with this bill is not going to accelerate innovation in cancer therapy , but might , as a result of unintended consequences , endanger our patients by uncontrolled experimentation			0
' ' it has set ethical guidelines for the use of new therapies and interventions - they are identical to the provisions of the @entity0			0
' when the @entity16 had its second reading in june , lord @entity1 told peers : ' all cancer deaths are wasted lives			1
' scientific knowledge has not advance by one centimetre as a result of all these deaths , because the current law requires the deceased receive only the standard procedure - the endless repetition of a failed experiment			0
' the current law is a barrier to progress in curing cancer			0
' it is understood the @entity67 is minded to support the @entity16 , which would have to complete its passage through the @entity148 and then go through all its commons stages before becoming law			0
a @entity67 spokeswoman said : ' innovation is at the heart of modernising the @entity154 and is essential for improving treatments and finding new cures and work on the @entity0 is ongoing			2
' we are pleased that @entity1 has tabled amendments to the @entity16 to help ensure patient and staff safety			1
' the @entity110 ( @entity110 ) and @entity111 both originally expressed concerns about the @entity16 but now broadly support the change in the law , providing safeguards are put in place			0
professor sir @entity167 , chair of the @entity110 , told @entity168 : ‘ medicine is a risky business			0
there are many people alive today because of the willingness of doctors to innovate , deal with uncertainty and take reasonable risks which are understood , shared with , and consented to , by the patient in accordance with good medical practice			0
‘ while we welcome the amendments to the @entity16 in @entity1 ’s name we look forward to seeing the final version '			1
@entity183 , the charity 's director of policy and information , said : ' we know that more could be done to promote innovation in cancer treatment , especially for patients with life - threatening conditions where there are few treatment options , and the @entity0 aims to support clinicians to act innovatively where they have exhausted other options			1
' the latest set of amendments laid on the @entity0 are an improvement , requiring a doctor to seek advice from an appropriately qualified colleague before departing from standard treatment			0
as the @entity16 now passes through @entity23 , we must ensure it contains appropriate safeguards to protect patients			2
' we will monitor the @entity16 ’s progress closely and hope we will see a greater focus on innovation thanks to this @entity16			0
