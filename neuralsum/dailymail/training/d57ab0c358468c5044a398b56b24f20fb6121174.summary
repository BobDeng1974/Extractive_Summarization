@entity0 secured five of seven match packages offered up by the @entity2 to @entity7 's two as the broadcasters contributed to a record £ 5.136billion rights deal , announced on tuesday			1
here @entity9 's @entity8 answers all the big questions surrounding the deal - who won what and what it means for clubs , fans and @entity18 football as a whole			2
q : so what was the big deal about tuesday 's announcement ? a : that it really was a big deal			0
much bigger than anyone expected			0
@entity0 and @entity7 currently pay £ 3.018bn to show all the available live @entity2 games between them each season , until the end of 2015 - 16			1
@entity0 sealed five of seven @entity2 match packages to cover the likes of @entity32 from 2016 @entity0 and @entity7 contributed to a record £ 5.136billion rights deal that is a 70 per cent increase on last deal but in a move that shocked everyone , the value of rights has soared again , and the same two broadcasters will be paying £ 5.136bn for the three - year period 2016 - 19			1
that ’s a rise of more than 70 per cent			0
q : who got what , and what did they pay ? a : @entity0 have won the rights to five packages , or 126 games per season ( up from 116 now ) , and will continue to show the major games each week in the 4pm sunday slot , as well as monday night football , occasional games on friday nights , plus saturday lunchtime and sunday afternoon games			1
@entity7 will show 42 games per season ( up from 38 ) , at saturday tea - time and in midweek			2
@entity0 will pay £ 1.392bn per season or £ 4.176bn in total , which works out at a staggering £ 11.05m per game , up from the £ 6.6m they pay now			1
@entity7 will pay £ 320m a season , or £ 960m in total , or £ 7.6m a game , up from £ 6.5m a game now			1
@entity2 chief executive @entity67 announced the staggering deal on tuesday @entity67 told media @entity0 ' coverage will rise from 116 to 126 games a season and @entity7 will show four more than their current 38 matches q : how will that affect fans who currently subscribe to their services ? a : @entity7 were always planning to introduce an element of pay - per - view from next season anyway as they start to show @entity81 and @entity82 games exclusively			1
pricing plans are not available yet			0
@entity0 ’s extra expenditure would most naturally come from an increase in monthly cost , of perhaps between £ 9 and £ 12 for @entity0			2
but a @entity0 spokesman said on tuesday night : ‘ the company will work hard to minimise the impact of higher rights costs on customers , with the majority of the funding coming through substantial additional savings to be delivered by efficiency plans			0
’ @entity0 pundits @entity97 ( left ) and @entity98 analyse a recent match - the new deal means their broadcaster will be showing 126 games per season q : what does that mean in @entity18 ? a : probably a price rise anyway , of unconfirmed amounts , depending on how many ‘ efficiency ’ savings they make , presumably cutbacks on other programming or job cuts			1
q : what will this mean for clubs in terms of extra income ? a : as things stand the @entity2 makes around £ 5.9billion for the three - year cycle 2013 - 16 from live @entity121 rights ( £ 3.018bn ) , all overseas rights combined ( £ 2.23bn ) , @entity121 highlights ( @entity124 , £ 170m ) and a variety of clip rights , near - live rights and sponsorship income , for example from title sponsor @entity130			1
from 2016 - 17 , the live @entity121 rights along will jump to £ 5.136bn alone , with foreign rights expected to rise to around £ 3bn , and with all the other bits and pieces , the total pot should grow from £ 5.9bn over three years to around £ 8.8bn			2
@entity7 's ( from left ) @entity136 and pundits @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 will show @entity81 and @entity82 games exclusively from next season q : so what does that mean in cold hard cash for the clubs ? a : put it like this : the bottom club last season made £ 62m from central funds and the highest earning club , @entity154 , earned £ 97.5m			2
from 2016 - 17 , the bottom club can expect to earn around £ 99m a season and the highest earning club around £ 156m			0
this might be a bit lower if the overseas rights do n’t climb as high as £ 3bn			0
or it could be more , in which case the clubs ’ income could rise even higher			0
q : what about the fans ? a : you mean the customers ? certainly the clubs will have no excuse whatsoever to start using some of this extraordinary extra money to make cuts to ticket prices that are the most expensive in world club football			0
@entity2 ceo @entity67 insists he will do what he can to encourage this , but he ultimately can not force such cuts			0
