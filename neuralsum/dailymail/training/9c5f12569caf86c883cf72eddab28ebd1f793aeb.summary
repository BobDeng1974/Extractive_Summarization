by @entity0 published : 03:55 est , 2 october 2012 updated : 06:27 est , 2 october 2012 it started as a ‘ tussle , ’ just a ‘ skirmish , ’ but at some point , @entity6 simply ‘ lost it ’			1

got into a tussle and there was this silver cart thing next to the edge of the kitchen counter and we must have knocked it down and we must have knocked it down and all the cutlery , the knives were in the … they just all fell to the ground and then we fell to the ground			0
‘ and i was on top of her			0
then my hand just got a cut and it was bleeding a lot profusely and i just … things got out of control			0
’ after stabbing miss @entity18 repeatedly , he then admitted to dragging her , as she lay dying , from her living room into her bedroom before flinging his coat on her , according to the @entity67			1
rather than calling the emergency services , he phoned his parents , sister and his son to ‘ apologise , ’ changed out of his blood - soaked clothes and left the @entity73 apartment to hail a cab			0
confession : @entity6 ( centre ) admitted to stabbing his girlfriend after they began to ' tussle ' following an argument brutal : miss @entity18 was nearly decapitated and the blade of one of the knives used by @entity6 was still in her skull when police found her all the while his girlfriend lay bleeding out in her bedroom			1
when asked by the prosecutor whether he thought to call 911 , @entity6 simply answered : ‘ no. ’ at no point in the interview did @entity6 ask what condition @entity18 was in , but he did note that her condition was ‘ really bad ’ at the point of leaving the flat			2
he was then asked why he did not call an ambulance			0
‘ i was just afraid , panicked , scared , ’ he explained of not calling an ambulance			0
‘ i just , i did n’t know what to expect			0
’ last week @entity6 pleaded guilty to @entity18 ’s murder			1
@entity102 @entity101 @entity100 presided over that plea as well as the two - day pre-sentencing hearing that concluded on monday			0
@entity6 will find out the sentence for his crime on october 29 , and is expected to receive anything from 15 years to life in prison			2
the killer is hoping his mental state and his guilty plea will earn him a lesser sentence			1
last week , miss @entity18 ’s father , @entity115 , laid bare his grief at the loss of his daughter as he testified in court			1
in an emotional testimony , the millionaire lawyer from @entity121 , said : ‘ when i identified @entity18 's body in the basement of the morgue , her injuries , the look on her face , the terror , will haunt me for the rest of my life and haunt the rest of her family			2
' haunted : miss @entity18 's ( left ) father , @entity134 ( right ) , identified the mutilated body of his once - beautiful daughter in the morgue and said the terror in her face will ' haunt me for the rest of my life ' mr @entity115 described how he had travelled to @entity73 , expecting to share a meal with his daughter at her favourite pizza restaurant , according to the @entity67			1
he read aloud his final text to his daughter - ' love you , ' which he sent as he set off for the @entity145 she had already been dead for eight hours and what he saw when he arrived in @entity73 was miss @entity18 's once - beautiful face criss - crossed by gashes in the city morgue , her perfect teeth grimacing in pain			1
prosecutor @entity152 told @entity153 , who will decide @entity6 's fate , that the killer murdered the young marketer with ' breathtaking viciousness			1
' he also described how neighbours awoke to her screams but heart - wrenchingly could n't work out where to send police , according to the @entity67			0
@entity165 blooded : @entity6 left the apartment , with miss @entity18 bleeding on her bedroom floor , and hailed a cab to leave the scene ' there were so many soul - shattering screams that half - a - dozen @entity73 got out of their beds at 2.30 in the morning , ' @entity152 said			1
' these neighbors roamed their hallways , calling , " where are you ? where are you ? " miss @entity18 was living in a tenement apartment in the lower @entity102 neighbourhood and the proximity of the houses to each other left neighbours thinking her blood - curdling screams were coming from the building next door			1
as such , @entity6 was lacerating the young woman for 35 minutes before police finally knocked on the right apartment , eventually finding her breathing her last breathes in a puddle of blood , with bent and broken knives littering the floor			2
prosecutors are expected to ask for the maximum sentence - 25 years to life			0
but defence attorney @entity196 is likely to argue that @entity6 deserves a reduced sentence because of mental health issues .			1

@entity6 's taped confession of killing @entity18 , 23 , details ' skirmish ' that ' got out of control '
miss @entity18 was found still breathing in a pool of blood after being stabbed some 30 times
@entity209 is hoping for reduced sentence based on guilty plea and mental health *problems*
