by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:05 est , 29 march 2013 updated : 19:05 est , 29 march 2013 life - saving operation : @entity3 , from @entity4 , had open heart surgery at 22 hours old , with mother @entity6 parents of children with serious heart conditions were ‘ obstructed ’ from seeking treatment elsewhere by staff at a scandal - hit heart unit , campaigners have claimed			1
heart operations on children at @entity16 were suspended on thursday night following concerns over high death rates and allegedly unsafe practices			1
a senior heart surgeon at the unit has also been banned from operating on children while ‘ aspects of his practice ’ are investigated			1
@entity27 bosses said they had been forced to act after finding that death rates were twice the national average – with ‘ clear blue water ’ between the number of patients dying at the unit and mortality rates elsewhere			1
the suspension of the unit provoked a huge political row yesterday , with mps and some parents claiming the timing – just 24 hours after a @entity42 ruling quashed plans to close the centre – was ‘ deeply questionable ’			1
some experts said the data on death rates was ‘ preliminary ’ and should not have been used to justify the suspension			1
but yesterday shocking new claims emerged that families unhappy with the care at the unit had been blocked from going elsewhere			0
staff at the unit – which has been operating under threat of closure since last year – were said to have been so desperate for patients not to go to another hospital that they gave ‘ wholly inappropriate ’ advice to patients			1
one such family was even reported to social services , it is alleged			1
the @entity27 safety watchdog the @entity65 was sent a letter by the patient group @entity67 last month , claiming that : heartbreaking : @entity68 insisted to be referred to the @entity69 in @entity70 after doctors at @entity16 told her there was no chance @entity74 would survive @entity68 claims a cardiologist at @entity16 tried to pressure her into having an abortion when her unborn child was diagnosed with a serious heart condition			1
the 26 - year - old said her son @entity74 , now 18 months , only survived because she researched his condition and discovered he could have life - saving surgery			2
miss @entity68 was five months pregnant when she was told her baby had hypoplastic left heart syndrome , which occurs when the left side of the heart fails to form properly			2
she claims a consultant cardiologist then told her there was no chance of him surviving and that she should have a termination			0
however , after finding there was an operation possible – at the @entity69 in @entity70 – she insisted she be referred there			0
@entity74 was induced at 39 weeks on september 8 2011 and transferred immediately to the @entity69 , where he underwent major surgery when he was just 22 hours old			0
miss @entity68 , of @entity94 , @entity4 , welcomed news of a review into care service at @entity16			0
she said : ‘ @entity74 still has a long way to go and will need a heart transplant in the future but he is doing well			2
‘ he lives life to the full			0
it is heartbreaking to look at him and think he would n’t be here if @entity104 had their way			0
’ the letter compared the situation to the @entity110 heart scandal in the 1990s , where 35 babies died and dozens more were left brain - damaged by hospital failures			1
it accuses the unit of trying to protect its reputation as a safe surgical centre by sending complex surgeries to other centres or not risking operations that may be unsuccessful			2
the @entity16 strongly denied ‘ any suggestion we would act improperly ’			2
but @entity122 , chief executive of the @entity123 , which represents 22 bodies including @entity67 , said she had written to the @entity65 because she felt ‘ morally obliged to flag up safety concerns ’			2
she said : ‘ it appears managers and clinicians in @entity104 , together with the parent support group , have put their own interests ahead of the well - being of critically ill children			1
’ critically ill : @entity3 is the youngest person in the country to undergo open heart surgery			2
he had the operation in @entity70 after doctors at @entity16 allegedly pressured mother @entity6 to have an abortion she claimed many families had been left too frightened to raise concerns in case it affected the care given to their children			1
mrs @entity122 said the ‘ chilling ’ parents ’ cases came after numerous other worries had been raised about @entity16 , and called for the unit to be permanently closed			1
@entity104 is one of three out of 14 children ’s heart units set to close following last year ’s @entity153 aimed at providing services in a smaller number of specialised centres			1
controversial decision : sir @entity158 as national medical director authorised the suspension of the unit the unit fought back , with huge public support and a legal campaign against the closure			0
it won the first round of a court battle on wednesday after judges found the consultation on closing the unit had been flawed			0
the move to close the unit over safety concerns just 24 hours later led campaigners and mps to question the basis of the court decision			2
@entity179 , mp for @entity180 , said he was ‘ stunned and appalled ’ by the suspension and called for @entity27 medical director sir @entity158 to resign			0
he also called on health secretary @entity182 to immediately lift the suspension of the @entity104 unit			1
‘ sir @entity158 should resign as he has both authorised this wholly unreasonable and deeply questionable action and also presided over the fundamentally flawed @entity153 and @entity186 review , ’ he said			0
the row intensified further when an expert claimed the mortality data on which the decision was based was ‘ not fit to be used ’			0
dr @entity191 , of the steering committee for the @entity194 database , which supplied the data , said the figures were preliminary and had not undergone the ‘ usual rigorous checking process ’			0
but sir @entity158 yesterday said it would have been irresponsible to ignore a ‘ constellation ’ of warnings , including mortality data			0
he told @entity203 ’s today : ‘ i could n’t sit back just because the timing was inconvenient , awkward or would look suspicious , as it does			0
’ the suspension was agreed by the @entity207 , whose chief executive @entity208 apologised to parents and families who will be affected			0
@entity212 said the suspension was for checks to be made to ensure the unit is operating @entity215 last night admitted it had received claims that uncertainty over the future of children ’s heart surgery at the @entity16 was harming outcomes			1
a @entity65 spokesman said : ‘ we are in close contact with the trust to ensure effective arrangements are in place to protect the safety and welfare of patients during the period of the review			0

children *'s* heart operations suspended at @entity104 hospital on thursday
suspension came after concerns over *unusually* high death rates
move has been *widely* criticised as the results were only ' preliminary '
mother says son would not be here if @entity16 had their way
a mother was referred to social services as having @entity254 ’s syndrome by proxy , because of her wish to move her son to a centre which would treat his *symptoms* .
another parent was unable to get a referral for a child ’s desperately - needed transplant .
a third mother who was told her child was ‘ *inoperable* ’ managed to contact another unit and get the child operated on elsewhere .
treatment was delayed for a fourth seriously ill child and *obstacles* put in the way of referral . he was transferred ‘ in time to save his life , but perhaps not his health ’ .
