men from @entity1 have the biggest manhoods in @entity3 , according to a revealing new survey			1
those from @entity6 ' home town order the largest sized condoms , followed by their neighbours in @entity9 and @entity10			1
but when it comes to girth , it 's @entity15 chaps who claim the top prize , followed by those in @entity19 , @entity9 and @entity20			1
men from @entity1 , such as @entity6 , have the longest manhoods in @entity3 , a survey has revealed the survey , of 20,000 men by an online condom retailer , found a staggering four inch difference in the circumference of the smallest and largest men			1
the findings are said to be the most accurate set of size data recorded , avoiding the ' brag factor ' , as men who took part were buying custom - fit condoms			2
however the survey , from condom makers @entity36 , does suggest the average man on the street may be deluded when it comes to his size			1
it found the average @entity3 man is only 5.1 inches long , rather than the often quoted average of six inches , while the average girth ( circumference ) is 4.7 inches			1
in fact , 26 per cent of men are less than five inches when erect , while 53 per cent are between five and six inches			0
twenty one per cent of men claim to be longer than six inches			0
men from @entity1 ordered the largest condoms from the company 's web store , which stocks 95 different sizes of prophylactic			2
sizes range from three to 9.5 inches long and fit girths of 3.5 inches up to 7.5			0
fortunately for chaps paranoid about their manhood , the size is marked on the packet with a discreet code , rather than a measurement in inches			0
@entity64 , founder of the website , said : ' our anonymised data represents the most accurate survey of penis sizes ever collected			0
' previous studies have relied on self - reported measurements from men , leading to an issue of " size exaggeration "			0
' but men buying our condoms are much less likely to do this for two reasons - firstly because they are parting with money for a custom fit condom and secondly because of our size code system ( rather than labels like small , medium and large ) , there 's simply less focus on whether someone is bigger or smaller - it 's all about getting a custom fit			0
the problem of fit with standard condoms has long been recognised - a study published in the @entity92 in 1993 called for different sizing - while a study in 2010 reported 45 per cent of men complained that their condoms did not fit .			2

men in the @entity99 order the largest sized condoms , says online retailer
those in @entity9 and @entity10 are the second and third biggest
chaps in @entity107 are the *widest* , followed by @entity19 and then @entity9
average man only 5.1in long when erect , not the *6in* most men think they are
