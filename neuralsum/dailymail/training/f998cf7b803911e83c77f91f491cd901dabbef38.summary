in the video , which has been viewed more than 500,000 times in the past week , the @entity1 and @entity3 attempt to show off the $ 2,000 @entity16 in their own comedic way by making risotto - or in their words ' wet dinner porridge '			1
according to the women , a @entity16 is ' something you buy because you 've always wanted to join a cult , but do n’t have the energy for group sex ’ or it 's ' the kind of a appliance that your rich mother - in - law gives you as a wedding gift , because she does n't think you can cook '			2
on the other hand , @entity3 throws a mishmash of ingredients into the @entity16 in the space of a few minutes and relaxes with a bottle of wine			1
the @entity16 has become a staple in @entity2 kitchens			0
it 's famous for it 's ability to create a full meal out of a plethora of ingredients			0
it 's a blender , steamer , chopper - and according to @entity3 , it 's a ' gang - bang of appliances that 's created a futuristic robot saucepan '			2
' it ’s like an @entity62 baby that ends up being a psychopath - you have no choice but to love it , ' @entity3 says in the video , referring to its $ 2000 price tag			0
