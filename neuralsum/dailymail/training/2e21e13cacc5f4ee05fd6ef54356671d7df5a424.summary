cats are never around when you want them most			0
they 're often out prowling and hunting and climbing , and seldom come when you call			0
but sometimes they right in front of your eyes and you have no idea , as one woman , who called herself ms. @entity10 on online noticeboard @entity11 , has discovered			1
@entity12 ? come out : ms @entity10 spent a good 10 minutes searching for her pet			1
so where is @entity12 ? she said she spent 10 minutes searching her house for her cat , whose name is @entity12			2
she went outside , did a sweep of the living room and bedrooms , but nothing			0
it was only on the second look in the living room - where there are plenty of hiding spots - did she realize where her pet actually was			0
can you find @entity12 ? there you are : ms @entity10 said the cat , who has bright yellow eyes , was sleeping sitting up and she could n't see him sitting right in front of her stealth : of the hiding spots in the room , @entity12 did n't need one			1

cats are among the *stealthiest* of *animals* , as one woman , ms @entity10 , discovered while madly searching the house for her pet , @entity12
