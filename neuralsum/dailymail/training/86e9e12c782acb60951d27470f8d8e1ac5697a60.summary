house speaker @entity0 has stuck an internet sales tax proposal in a drawer and he does n't intend to dust it off before the end of the @entity6 shopping season – if he considers it at all			1
the @entity7 , passed last year in the @entity8 , would allow each state to force out - of - state online retailers to collect sales taxes from its residents			1
but a @entity0 spokesman said late monday in a statement that the plan is n't going anywhere			0
shopping freedom ? house speaker @entity0 wants online purchases to be tax - free so retailers – including small internet businesses – wo n't have to do paperwork for all 45 states that collect sales taxes ' the speaker has made clear in the past he has significant concerns about the bill , and it wo n’t move forward this year , ” said spokesman @entity29			1
' the @entity30 continues to examine the measure and the broader issue			0
in the meantime , the @entity33 and @entity8 should work together to extend the moratorium on internet taxation without further delay			2
' the committee , chaired by @entity40 @entity39 rep. @entity39 , has sat on the @entity7 since early in 2013			0
a congressional aide told @entity42 that @entity39 fears forcing internet stores to collect sales taxes could create new tax - compliance nightmares			1
they would have to manage the requirements of all 45 states that collect sales taxes , the staffer explained , while traditional stores with no more than a few locations only need to worry about one			1
that would n't be a problem for a shoe store like @entity57 , but it could be a paperwork headache for every small business that has an online presence			1
the @entity61 , a trade group , is backing brick - and - mortar shops that want to see internet sales taxes everywhere since their walk - in customers have to pay the taxes on everything they buy			1
' the bill may change or even be folded into another piece of " must - pass " legislation			2
@entity61 communications director @entity70 tweeted monday			0
' the fight is far from over			0
' ' we have about three weeks in the lame duck			2
retailers are all in to get this done this year			0
' the @entity78 administration backed the proposal when the @entity8 bill made national news			2
' we believe that the @entity7 will level the playing field for local small business retailers who are undercut every day by out - of state online companies , ' the @entity33 's then - press secretary @entity85 told reporters in april 2013			1
' today , while local small business retailers follow the law and collect sales taxes from customers who make purchases in their stores , many big business online and catalogue retailers do not collect the same taxes			1
this puts local neighborhood - based small businesses at a disadvantage to big , out - of - state , online companies			1
' big money : state legislators hope new laws will help recapture tax revenue lost when consumers makes billions in purchases each year from sites like @entity109 but @entity110 , the famously anti-tax president of @entity111 , lashed out at the idea			2
' too many politicians in state capitols and @entity115 have looked at the internet only as a way to raise taxes , ' he told @entity42 on tuesday			2
' they want to tax internet access , they want to raise internet sales			0
' ' @entity0 has drawn a line in the sand saying the @entity125 people come first and politicians need to keep their hands off the @entity128			0
... @entity78 says yes to taxing the @entity128 , @entity129 says yes to taxing the @entity128			0
speaker @entity0 just said " hell no " to taxing the @entity128			0
' one odd development will strike the states of @entity40 and @entity132 if the @entity7 does n't become law , according to @entity134			0
transportation funding calculations in both of those states will change unless they can start collecting sales tax from their residents who buy things across state lines			1
the net results will be higher gas taxes beginning in january , meaning that the @entity143 and the ' @entity144 ' – @entity132 – will get their money either way			0
@entity109 already collects sales tax from residents of 23 states and wants the bill passed so it can establish its own ' level playing field ' with other online giants like @entity154 and @entity155			1
both of those companies oppose the legislation .			0

house speaker is n't going to bring up a @entity8 - passed ' *fairness* ' bill during the lame - duck congressional *session*
legislation would allow states to collect sales taxes from their residents ' online purchases , no matter where the *e-tailer* is located
brick - and - mortar stores and their trade groups want a *mandate* because they all have to collect sales taxes from walk - in customers
@entity178 worry that all online stores , including small businesses , will find themselves having to deal with paperwork for nearly every @entity125 state
