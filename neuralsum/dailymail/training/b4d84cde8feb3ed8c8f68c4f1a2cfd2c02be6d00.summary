the abandoned mine once occupied by workers and machinery has become an unusual attraction for adventurous explorers workers mined thousands of tonnes of chalk – a soft white limestone which contains layers of flint – for a variety of everyday purposes @entity14 decided to explore the shafts – where passageways can play tricks on the eyes – after hearing about the mine from a friend when the 31 - year - old arrived at the mine he was surprised to find that the entrance had already been pried open by previous explorers ‘ we spent around three hours in the mines and i was fascinated with the strange markings on the walls caused by the mining equipment			1
