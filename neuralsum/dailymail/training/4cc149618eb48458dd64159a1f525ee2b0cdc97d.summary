by @entity0 with echoes of hit film @entity5 , seven @entity2 farmers from the same area have been left single after their mail - order brides all fled the country together			1
they fared slightly better than the men in the 1999 film , though , which sees bride @entity10 , played by @entity12 , leave several grooms at the altar			1
the farmers at least tied the knot with the women they bought from @entity18			1
deception : three of the @entity18 brides who married @entity2 farmers and then fled scam : according to local authorities the gullible guys are the latest case of desperate men believing that they can buy love on the internet attractive : two of the brides pose for a photograph in a field out of pocket : the invoice for one of the brides but the marriages did n’t last long , with the women fleeing after just seven days			1
the fiasco has left the farmers seriously out of pocket , as they ’d each paid around 50,000 rmb – or £ 5,000 – for their wives according to local authorities the gullible guys are just the latest case of desperate men often from rural areas believing that they can buy love on the internet			1
the websites show attractive women , and promise good housekeeping and cooking skills , but officials warn that at the end of the day it is all about women who are controlled by greedy commercial agencies that pay them commissions for the number of men they wed. @entity63 , 46 , was one of the seven in southern @entity2 's @entity65 who became a victim of the @entity18 vixens			1
and now his new wife , like the other brides , has vanished			2
‘ getting a woman from @entity18 is popular around here , ’ said @entity63			1
‘ the women are considered faithful , kind , considerate and good housekeepers			2
it is hard to find a @entity2 woman - the strict one - child birth policy means that most @entity2 families only want a son			1
’ this policy has been implicated in an increase in the number of killings of newborn girls and forced abortions in the country since it was introduced in 1979			2
@entity63 went on : ‘ i found this woman through an agency and i thought she was lovely			0
we married two days after being introduced			2
i borrowed the money to pay the agency 50,000 rmb ( £ 5,000 )			1
‘ for a couple of days all was blissful			0
i went out to work and i left her at home , stitching , cleaning , making the evening meal			0
it was just as i expected things to be			0
heartbroken : the mother of one of the heartbroken grooms holds up a photograph of him on his wedding day , pictured with a bride that would leave him days later generosity : a woman holds up clothes that were bought for one of the brides ‘ i knew my wife was friendly with the other brides in the area			2
she said that on such - and - such a day they would all be going out for a girls ' shopping trip			0
but it was one she never came home from - and neither did the other brides			0
‘ it was all a con			0
they upped sticks and left en - masse			0
my wife took away a lot of my money and the lovely clothes and gifts i had bought for her as a token of my love as we started our new life together			0
’ he and the others who were duped have now reported their losses to the local police , who have started an enquiry .			0
