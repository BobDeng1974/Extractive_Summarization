@entity0 has vowed to live on just $ 29 worth of food for a week , after agreeing to take on a charity challenge aimed at raising awareness and funds for @entity6 's food banks			1
the 42 - year - old mother - of - two , who founded popular lifestyle wesbite @entity8 , posted a picture of her $ 29 grocery shop on her @entity13 account yesterday afternoon , showcasing a range of healthy options , including a variety of fresh vegetables , some brown rice and some black beans			1
' this is what $ 29 gets you at the grocery store - what families on @entity25 ( i.e. food stamps ) have to live on for a week , ' she wrote alongside the image			1
food - focused : actress - turned - lifestyle guru @entity0 will be living off $ 29 worth of food for a week as part of a charity challenge aimed at raising awareness about food banks @entity34 shop the brand at @entity36 visit site a good blazer is an essential item that every girl should have in her wardrobe			1
but add a touch of satin to it like @entity0 in her @entity34 version , and it goes from drab to deluxe in the blink of an eye			2
the @entity8 creator made hers a monochrome look by teaming the blush jacket with a flesh toned sweater dress underneath			0
the silken topper is great for an evening out and can be paired with cigarette trousers and strappy sandals for an elegant take on the menswear trend			0
@entity0 's threads are from a few seasons back , so it 's no longer available in stores			1
but our style edit is filled with lustrous alternatives from @entity65 to forever 21			0
there 's even a designer rendition with a snakeskin lapel for those so inclined to spend a little more			0
@entity71 ' @entity70 at @entity72 visit site forever 21 @entity74 visit site @entity76 ( now $ 30 ) visit site @entity79 satin blazer at @entity80 ( now $ 784 ) visit site unsurprisingly , although the grocery store no doubt offered a wealth of cheaper , yet more unhealthy , food options , lifestyle guru @entity0 opted to stick to what she knows best , choosing only the healthiest and greenest of ingredients for the challenge			1
it looks as though @entity0 might be going for a @entity90 theme on at least one of the days of the challenge , including gluten - free tortillas , black beans , and avocado in her food haul - all the makings of a very healthy @entity90 - inspired feast			1
in a second tweet posted yesterday , she said of the challenge : ' we 're walking in their shoes to see how far we get			0
' she then proceeded to nominate popular @entity104 chef @entity103 , tagging him by his @entity13 username @ @entity106			0
@entity0 also encouraged her fans to head over to the @entity109 website , take up the challenge themselves , and donate to the cause			2
there are those , however , who are already criticizing @entity0 's attempt to experience what living on food stamps is really like ; although the actress has vowed to live on just $ 29 for the week , many suggest that her bizarrely healthy food choices demonstrate just how out of touch she is with the average person			1
weekly haul : the 42 - year - old actress posted this image of her grocery shop , which included a variety of incredibly healthy food items challenge : @entity0 took to @entity13 to share the news about her charity challenge writer @entity131 from @entity132 , highlighted the incredible lack of calories contained in @entity0 's food choices , suggesting that those people living on @entity25 benefits would require a lot more sustenance in order to go about their day - to - day lives			1
' i know other people are critiquing this already , but this bothers me on a basic level because eight of those 16 items are not calorically significant ( sic ) , ' @entity131 wrote			0
' nutritionally speaking , this is a vitamin bonanza			0
' but people who live on @entity25 benefits do n’t just have to get nutrients , they have to get actual calories , because they tend to have very physical lives , doing service labor and taking care of children and not necessarily being able to afford a car and so forth			2
' according to @entity132 , the food in @entity0 's @entity13 post contains a total of 7,059 calories , which means the star will be consuming a paltry 1,000 calories per day for the duration of her week - long challenge			1
that is approximately half of the recommended daily intake for adults suggested by the @entity171			0
friends together : @entity0 was nominated to take on the week - long challenge by celebrity chef @entity174 ( pictured together in april 2013 ) family ties : it is not known whether @entity0 's children with ex-husband @entity179 - @entity178 , ten , and @entity180 , nine ( pictured ) - will be taking part in the challenge with their mother many people have also queried why @entity0 might require a total of seven limes - one per day - for the challenge , suggesting that the money spent on the seemingly pointless fruits would have been better spent on some potatoes , or other filling carbohydrate options			1
for example , @entity192 - where @entity0 appears to have completed at least part of her shopping - currently sells individual limes for 60 cents each , which adds up to $ 4.20 for seven			2
had @entity0 chosen a more substantial menu item , she could have picked up four 16 ounce bags of pasta - which retail for $ 1 - for less than the price of her limes			2
@entity0 's decision to take on the $ 29 - per - week challenge comes less than a month after she told @entity204 that she considers herself to be ' incredibly close to the common woman '			1
' i 'm incredibly close to the common woman in that i 'm a woman and i 'm a mother and we all are in a physical body with beating hearts with compassion and love we are all seekers , ' she said in an interview			0
' we all want fulfillment , we all want to live our best lives			0
we want to be healthy and happy and squeeze the most we can out of life			0
i think that 's all women			0
' @entity0 was initially dared to take on the challenge by her close friend , celebrity chef @entity174 , who is a member of the @entity221 board , and also challenged singers @entity223 and @entity224 to take part in the week - long trial			2
according to the @entity109 website , the challenge is aimed at raising public awareness about the plight of the hungry , while also enabling each participant to understand more about the daily struggle those living on food stamps face			2
' @entity237 cut food stamps twice since 2013 , and soup kitchens and food pantries saw an immediate increase in visitors , ' the food bank 's fundraising page explains			0
' @entity6 ca n't afford any cuts to @entity25 … the # @entity243 raises hunger awareness and deepens your understanding about the struggle to afford food on a food stamp budget			1
' it is not known whether @entity252 's two children with ex-husband @entity179 , @entity178 , ten , and @entity180 , nine , will also be taking part in the challenge however , given the limited supply of food featured in her @entity13 picture , it is thought the @entity261 star is going it alone this time around .			1

the 42 - year - old mother - of - two tweeted a picture of her $ 29 grocery shop , which included eggs , vegetables , brown rice and black beans
@entity0 is taking part in the @entity6 @entity272 , which aims to raise awareness and funds for the city 's food banks
the city 's weekly food stamp *allowance* is just $ 29 per person per week
@entity0 's healthy food choices have already come under fire from critics who claim they contain nowhere near enough calories for a whole week
