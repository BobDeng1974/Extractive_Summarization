by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:27 est , 10 august 2012 updated : 07:44 est , 11 august 2012 until this week , @entity2 had never been to watch his daughter compete in taekwondo.the prospect of seeing his eldest child , @entity5 , 19 , get kicked in the head for trophies was ‘ too scary ’ to see			1
but on thursday a very proud – and sometimes still scared – mr @entity2 was feet away when she realised her @entity10 dream			1
in a tight final , the petite blonde from @entity12 , a small town in @entity13 , beat the @entity15 two - time world champion to become @entity17 ’s first taekwondo gold medallist and the youngest @entity19 gold medal winner of the @entity20 so far			1
‘ @entity38 is not the word , to see your daughter competing and win a gold medal in the @entity43 , it ’s unbelievable			1
i ’m so happy for her			2
‘ to see @entity5 on that medal rostrum , i had tears in my eyes and a lump in my throat			0
i still ca n’t believe she pulled it off			0
’ mr @entity2 , a father of three , admitted he had hated watching at times during her winning bout at the excel arena			1
‘ until now i could n’t bear to watch her fight , ’ said			1
‘ but she made me go and see her this time , i obviously could n’t miss her at the @entity43			0
‘ at times i could n’t look and wanted to run off , it ’s scary watching your daughter getting kicked			1
but i watched every round , i screamed and shouted as loud as i could with the crowd , it was very tense			0
’ referring to the next @entity43 , in @entity61 in 2016 , he added : ‘ i ’m going to have to pick a fair few cockles to try and get myself to @entity63 now that i ’ve broken my duck of going to watch her compete			1
‘ she ’s the best in the world now , so hopefully nobody will be knocking her out for the foreseeable future			0
’ on top of the world : taekwondo fighter @entity22 shows off her gold medal - the 25th won by @entity19 at @entity75 kiss of glory : @entity22 is @entity17 's first @entity10 taekwondo champion @entity79 had made the trip to @entity81 with @entity5 ’s mother , @entity83 , 40 , and grandfather , @entity85			1
mr @entity85 , 57 – her mother ’s stepfather – introduced @entity5 to the sport at the age of eight to keep her ‘ off the streets ’			0
although they split when @entity5 was just nine , her parents , who live less than a quarter of a mile apart in @entity12 , remain on good terms and she is close to both of them			0
@entity5 , raised in a council block with her 13 - year - old brother @entity94 , was a pupil at @entity95 when she got hooked on the @entity97 martial art. and , as our exclusive pictures show , @entity5 ’s talent soon began to shine			1
she won student of the year at her club several times and filled the trophy cabinet at her grandparents ’ house with awards , including national titles			2
to pursue her dream of a gold medal , at 15 she switched from @entity112 rules to the @entity114 code , used in the @entity43			2
by that point she had outgrown her local club , so her grandfather , who works as an engineer in a factory , devoted much of his spare time to driving her the 60 miles to train at the @entity121 , four times a week after school			0
@entity124 : the new @entity10 champion holds a @entity127 flag and a @entity129 flag on a lap of honour after her stunning victory golden girl : @entity2 celebrates glory in the @entity135 after beating @entity136 in the final jubilation : @entity5 leapt into the arms of her coach @entity140 as the pair celebrated her victory over @entity15 's @entity143 sweet moment : taekwondo fighter @entity22 celebrates winning @entity19 's 25th gold medal of @entity75 ‘ it ’s been hard , @entity5 ’s not come from a wealthy background , ’ her father said			1
‘ her grandfather has done an immense amount for her , taking her to training , covering her expenses , and we ’ve given her what we can along the way			0
’ she did well academically , passing nine gcses ‘ with flying colours , ’ but left @entity157 at 16 to take up the sport full - time			2
her former headmistress @entity159 was among the crowd to watch her fight on thursday			2
she said : ‘ we all knew she was good , but we had n’t realised just how fantastically good she was			0
’ @entity5 , nicknamed ‘ @entity162 ’ because of her liking for kicking opponents in the head , said she barely slept after her win			0
‘ i only had one hour ’s sleep , i was just lying in bed awake , ’ she said			0
‘ it was an unbelievable day , i always went there with the aim of getting gold and i knew i could win , but i knew it was going to be hard			1
’ ‘ i just gave it my everything and ended up on top , so i ’m just buzzing			0
’ yesterday the streets of @entity12 were also ‘ buzzing ’ with @entity5 ’s success			0
the night before , more than 300 people had packed into the town ’s sports and social club , standing on tables and cheering as they watched their girl bring home the gold			2
@entity5 comes from a large extended family – her father has around 50 cousins – and almost all of the 12,000 - strong @entity12 population seemed to be claiming some relation to her yesterday			1
many can boast of having had a hand in her career , after they clubbed together to raise the £ 1,600 @entity5 needed to get to the 2010 @entity10 qualifiers in @entity196 – where she won gold			1
houses , pubs , businesses and shops were decked in @entity203 bunting and @entity5 ’s face beamed from posters in their windows			0
and the butchers , where @entity5 ’s mother works as a sales assistant , had an @entity10 sausage on sale			2
video : @entity5 speaks about winning gold for @entity19 in @entity215 at the @entity43 !			2

the father of *teenage* taekwondo champ @entity22 cheered his daughter on to @entity10 victory - despite never having seen her compete before as it was ' too scary ' to watch
@entity2 said he finds watching his 19 - year - old daughter being kicked ' hard to bear '
the *teenage*r , from @entity13 , has become @entity17 's first taekwondo gold medalist
