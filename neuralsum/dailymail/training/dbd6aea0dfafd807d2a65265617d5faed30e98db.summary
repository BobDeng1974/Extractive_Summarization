by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:31 est , 21 november 2012 updated : 12:14 est , 22 november 2012 votes : justice secretary @entity3 today tabled a @entity4 offering three different options on prisoners ' rights to vote justice secretary @entity3 today raised the prospect of @entity10 defying the @entity11 over giving prisoners the vote			1
speaking in the commons he repeatedly stressed the @entity10 @entity15 is ‘ sovereign ’ and it was up to mps to decide whether or not to comply with rulings from @entity18			0
even if fines were imposed on @entity10 , mps could decide not to pay them			1
despite attorney general @entity25 warning cabinet ministers they could not take a stand against a @entity30 court ’s controversial diktat , mr @entity3 insisted : ‘ ultimately this @entity15 is sovereign , this @entity15 can decide whether it will accept a ruling of the @entity11 - of any sort - or whether it wo n't			1
’ it came as former justice minister @entity31 suggested @entity10 should not try to accommodate the @entity11			2
' we should n't defy the @entity11 : we should resile from it altogether			0
’ today mr @entity3 announced a joint committee of mps and peers would consider proposals for allowing convicts sentenced to less than four years or less than six months to participate in elections			1
the option of retaining the outright ban would also be considered			1
ministers will then ' reflect ' on the report before allowing mps to vote on one option			0
mr @entity3 warned the financial costs of introducing the vote for prisoners ' could be significant ' but also warned of the ' political cost ' if @entity10 defied the @entity11			1
' ultimately if this @entity15 decides not to agree to rulings from the @entity11 it has no sanction , ' mr @entity3 added			1
' it can apply fines in absentia but it will be for @entity15 to decide whether it wishes to recognise those decisions , as it is with all decisions			0
he said if the government opted to allow anyone jailed for under four years to vote , more than 4,000 burglary inmates would have the chance to choose their mp or local councillor			0
he added : ' the idea that depriving a prisoner of their vote means it 's more likely that they will reoffend or less likely that they will reintegrate into society is absurd			0
' today ’s draft @entity4 is published one day before the deadline to comply with the ruling by the @entity11 that the current blanket ban is unlawful			2
last february , the @entity84 called for the blanket ban to be maintained by an overwhelming margin of 234 to 22			2
officials will be waiting anxiously to see how @entity18 reacts to mr @entity3 's proposals			1
it could yet rule the government is deploying a delaying tactic and decide to start issuing compensation to inmates			0
former justice minister @entity31 said @entity10 should ' resile ' from the @entity11 altogether in the @entity84 today , mr @entity3 was repeatedly urged to stand up to @entity18			1
@entity64 mp @entity93 , the former justice secretary , said the @entity11 had decided to ' extend its jurisdiction from fundamental human rights into social and civic rights for which we had not signed up '			1
@entity99 @entity98 said the @entity10 people would welcome mr @entity3 ' putting their views first , making this @entity15 sovereign and ignoring a @entity104 court in @entity30 '			1
@entity31 , a former justice minister , called for the @entity10 to leave the jurisdiction of the @entity11 altogether			2
writing on the @entity107 website , he said : ' by bringing forward proposals for a limited enfranchisement , the government may try to claim that it has complied with the @entity11 's ruling , " mr @entity31 wrote			2
' but i fear this is unlikely to be the end of the matter			0
the @entity11 also required the @entity10 to " enact the relevant legislation within any time frame decided by the @entity118 "			0
yet it is virtually certain that the @entity120 will vote to retain the current ban			0
' there 's another absurdity in what is being proposed			0
ministers may in fact be unable to vote for , or even advocate , the existing ban - because to do so would breach the @entity127 , which does not allow them to advocate breaking the law			0
' he predicted that the @entity11 would start awarding prisoners compensation , and the public would find that even harder to ' stomach '			2
' we should n't defy the @entity11 : we should resile from it altogether , ' he added			0
mixed opinions : a string of @entity136 - led by the prime minister - are resisting demands from the @entity11 for some inmates to be granted the right to vote			1
this is a file picture of @entity143 maximum security jail @entity144 , a lawyer with @entity145 representing more than 500 prisoners seeking compensation from the government , said : ' the government is already facing claims for compensation running into the millions for refusing to allow serving prisoners the vote			0
' its stubborn refusal to take the necessary action is simply leaving it exposed to the cost of further claims			0
' @entity61 and a string of senior ministers have made plain their disgust at the idea of giving rapists , burglars or any other criminals the vote			2
but mr @entity25 has warned senior ministers that they must abstain when the crucial vote takes place in the @entity120 in the coming months			1
the law officer has also ruled that the government must not ‘ take a position ’ in the debate by expressing support for a ban			0
his position is that any attempt by ministers to influence the outcome would heighten the likelihood of a full - blown confrontation with the @entity11			2
officials believe the @entity10 ’s case will be strengthened if @entity15 as a whole – rather than the government of the day – is seen to make the decision that prisoner voting is unacceptable			0
but it will create the farcical situation of the prime minister – who says prisoner voting makes him feel ‘ physically ill ’ – not being able to stand up for what he believes in the division lobby			1
the instruction is likely to heighten tensions between mr @entity25 and some of his @entity201 colleagues , who are infuriated by @entity18 ’s meddling and want to send a clear message to its unaccountable judges			1
the attorney general has repeatedly bent over backwards to accommodate the court or avoid incurring its wrath			1
mr @entity25 is also under pressure for his refusal to intervene in the case of @entity212 soldier sgt @entity211 who was jailed for 18 months for keeping a pistol given to him in @entity216 .			2

justice secretary @entity3 tells mps @entity219 can ignore the @entity11 and refuse to pay any fines
he *unveiled* a three - option plan with the @entity84 expected to back an outright ban on prisoners voting
attorney general @entity25 had warned the @entity201 they must not express a view
@entity99 mps attack ' @entity104 court ' and urged mr @entity3 to stand firm
@entity61 said the idea of inmates taking part in elections makes him ' physically sick '
