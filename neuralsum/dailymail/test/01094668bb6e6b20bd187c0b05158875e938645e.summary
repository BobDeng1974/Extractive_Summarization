a bizarre performance from @entity1 saw @entity2 breeze through 6 - 1 , 6 - 2 to his first masters quarter - final of the season			1
@entity1 is the defending champion in @entity5 and seldom has a title been relinquished so easily			1
the @entity7 2 played like he was in a hurry - and not in a good way			0
rushing between points , @entity1 won the first of the match and then made four unforced errors in a row to surrender his serve			2
@entity2 powers a forehand from the back court in his comfortable win over @entity1 @entity1 , the @entity18 defending champion , appeared out of sorts in the 6 - 1 6 - 2 defeat the world no 9 looked listless and disinterested , rolling in 95mph first serves and ballooning groundstrokes long			1
he did not appear to be injured but something was very clearly wrong ; four winners and 41 unforced errors can not be put down merely to a bad day at the office			0
@entity1 's coach @entity28 is not in @entity5 this week and , watching at home , he may have been glad of the opportunity to turn off the television			2
@entity2 moves through to the quarter - finals where the @entity33 will meet @entity35 @entity34 @entity1 was n't at his finest as he failed to get on the board in the match until the fifth game in the second , @entity1 played a little better - he could scarcely have played worse - but still gave @entity2 a generous helping of mistakes			1
the world no 11 broke early and @entity1 served to stay in the match at 5 - 2 down			1
four tame unforced errors later and @entity2 was through to the last eight			0
the crowd on court central would have expected a thrilling encounter between two of the most expressive players on tour			0
instead , they were treated to an abject and mystifying performance from @entity1			0
the 30 - year - old finally got on the board in the fifth game of the match , although this was down more to errors from @entity2 - who was n't even playing especially well himself - than any improvement from the @entity62			1
but the @entity33 broke for a third time and closed out the first set 6 - 1			0
@entity2 and a disappointed @entity1 shake hands at the end of the quickfire encounter			2

@entity2 plays @entity34 in @entity18 quarter - final
@entity71 9 @entity1 looked listless and disinterested in the defeat
defending champion did n't get on the board until the match 's fifth game
