rising star : @entity1 is the youngest - ever woman to join a conservative @entity2 and is already being talked up as the ' next @entity4 ' for the youngest - ever woman to join a conservative cabinet — especially one who is already being talked up as the ‘ next @entity4 ’ — @entity1 has some unusual qualifications			1
the new environment secretary , 38 , whose constituency is just 15 miles from the @entity13 ’s @entity12 home at @entity14 , once called for the @entity16 ’s abolition			1
she ’s also described the @entity17 as ‘ among the worst idlers in the world ’			1
then there was the little matter of an 18 - month adulterous affair with a married @entity24 mp which , he said , cost him his marriage			1
it caused an almighty storm when she stood as a @entity24 parliamentary candidate in @entity12 and it emerged that she had failed to tell the selection committee about the relationship			2
all this is history , though			0
who could deny the ambitious @entity1 ’s astonishing agility , despite all that baggage , to find herself in the @entity2 less than four years since becoming an mp ? ‘ working with her is like being next to a hornets ’ nest , ’ says one figure who has worked under her at @entity39			1
‘ it ’s ceaseless , frenetic activity under the sword of @entity46 if things are n’t done exactly as she wants them			0
’ @entity1 has all the correct credentials to offset a party hierarchy full of @entity51			1
her first school was a primary in @entity54 , @entity55 , before moving to a comprehensive in @entity56			0
she was brought up in a left - wing household — her father a mathematics professor , her mother a nurse who took her on @entity63 marches			1
at @entity64 , @entity1 was president of the @entity65 and questioned the need for the @entity16			1
she declared : ‘ we @entity65 believe in opportunity for all			1
we believe in fairness and common sense			0
we do not believe people are born to rule			0
’ two years later , however , she joined the @entity24			2
after being elected as an mp , she co-authored @entity73 , which set out proposals to restore @entity17 ’s economic position			1
one passage said : ‘ the @entity17 are among the worst idlers in the world			1
we work among the lowest hours , we retire early and our productivity is poor			0
whereas @entity81 children aspire to be doctors or businessmen , the @entity17 are more interested in football and pop music			2
’ and now to the affair			2
at 28 , she was burning for front - line politics , having worked for both @entity89 and @entity90 in executive and accountancy roles			0
she had made it on to the party list of ‘ preferred candidates ’ when , in the run - up to the 2005 election , she worked in the office of @entity24 frontbencher @entity100 , the culture spokesman , who was 41			1
she was married , too , to a financial controller			0
field ’s wife @entity102 was chief executive of a hospital charitable foundation			0
@entity1 told friends that the baby was her husband ’s and when it was born , he was named as the father on the birth certificate			2
indeed , @entity1 ’s marriage survived the @entity118 the affair was well - known around @entity39 , no one told the selection committee at @entity12			1
their indignation at having chosen someone with such a large skeleton jangling in her cupboard led to vain efforts to deselect her , prompting some bright spark among the @entity39 @entity24 chatterati to dub those recalcitrant locals as the ‘ @entity130 ’			2
but the relevant moniker should have been ‘ @entity132 ’			2
a war of words raged , and when it died down , there she was , unhindered in her march to political stardom			0
affair : @entity1 's affair with former culture spokesman @entity100 ( right ) lasted 18 months			1
her marriage survived the scandal , but @entity100 was not so lucky field was not so lucky			2
his wife divorced him and he lost his frontbench position			0
these days , as his former intern - lover takes her seat at the @entity2 table , he remains on the backbenches as he approaches his 50th birthday			1
he is , however , happily remarried			0
around @entity39 , when they bump into each other , they nod politely			0
@entity1 has now also effectively leapfrogged her former boss at the @entity155 , @entity156			0
while working as his junior there , some detected what one colleague describes as ‘ the whiff of disloyalty ’ in the frank way she would talk publicly about her ‘ disappointment ’ over @entity156 not acting on her suggestions			0
as for the @entity168 brief , she is ‘ ferociously intelligent and will pick it up very quickly , ’ says one close figure , ‘ even though i observe scant interest in agriculture and rural affairs beyond what she absolutely needed as an mp with an agricultural constituency ’			1
those who work for her will also learn , as one with such experience says , ‘ that she is a sucker for flattery			0
@entity183 — especially about her genius , political skill , or emphatic , rosy predictions about her future career — are certain to be met with peals of girlish laughter			0
