@entity0 have won the bidding war for the rights to screen @entity5 v @entity3 in the @entity6 , as revealed by @entity7 last friday			1
the richest fight of all time will not come cheap either — for @entity10 or their subscribers — even though @entity0 are keeping faith with their core following by keeping the base price below £ 20			0
it has taken what is described by industry insiders as ‘ a very substantial offer ’ for @entity0 to fend off fierce competition from @entity21 ’s @entity20			1
@entity5 's hotly - anticipated bout with @entity3 will be shown on @entity10 @entity3 headed for the playground after working out in @entity24 previously the price for the fight has been set at £ 19.95 until midnight of friday may 1			1
the cost will remain the same for those paying via remote control or online , but will be £ 24.95 if booked via phone after friday			0
@entity0 are flirting with their threshold of £ 20 by charging £ 19.95 a buy on their sports box office channel until midnight on may 1 , rising to £ 24.95 on may 2 , the day of the fight in @entity36			1
since they are understood to have broken past protocol by offering the @entity40 promoters a cut of that revenue as well as a hefty up - front payment , it is expected they will have to shatter the pay - per - view record in this country to break even			0
the current @entity0 record stands at 1.2million buys for @entity48 ’s vegas loss to @entity5 in 2007			0
@entity21 is believed to have offered a higher lump sum than @entity0 in the hope of attracting another two million customers to his £ 12 - a - month subscription channel			2
it is doubtful if @entity0 can reach that number at £ 20 per sale at 4am on a sunday morning , but if they get 1.5m buys they should be out of the red			0
