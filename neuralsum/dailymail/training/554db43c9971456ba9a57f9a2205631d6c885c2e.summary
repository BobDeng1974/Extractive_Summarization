by @entity0 published : 08:11 est , 23 august 2013 updated : 13:20 est , 23 august 2013 @entity2 were banned from eating sausages to help with the first world war effort , researchers have said			1
zeppelin airships were a key weapon for the @entity7 during the 1914 to 1918 war but production placed a huge demand on cow guts , used to make gas holding cells			1
it took more than 250,000 cows to make a single airship and the animals ’ intestines became so precious that making the popular bratwurst and other sausages was temporarily made illegal in areas under @entity2 control			0
fear the wurst : @entity2 were banned from eating sausages during @entity25 because the @entity7 needed cows to help them produce @entity27 to launch raids on @entity29 gunned down : @entity30 48 comes down in @entity31 in 1917			1
initially they were difficult to bring down because a few bullet holes did not cause much air to leak out of the aircraft which hold thousands of gallons of air			0
however , an incendiary bullet was later developed which set the @entity27 alight details of the sausage ban were uncovered by researchers working on a @entity43 documentary in a document prepared for the @entity46 @entity45 in 1922			2
the ban also applied to occupied @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50			1
it read : ' the collection of the goldbeater ’s skins was very systematic in @entity55 during the war			1
' each butcher was required to deliver the ones from the animals he killed			0
' agents exercised strict control in @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 , where it was forbidden to make sausages			1
' for the programme dr @entity63 , a @entity64 engineer , examined the role of the @entity67 in the war , which foreshadowed the @entity69 by bringing war to @entity29 civilians for the first time in centuries			1
wreckage : an @entity67 is shot down by @entity29 fighter aircraft in 1916			2
by 1917 , 77 of the 115 @entity2 airships had been destroyed morale sapping : a @entity67 raid on @entity78 during @entity25 destroyed this house in @entity80 , @entity81 he studied how the silent aircraft were built and how the @entity29 adapted to their threat			1
' one of the most intriguing things about the @entity27 is that we do n’t have a huge amount of information about how they were built , nor about how they were destroyed , ' he said			2
' but while shooting down a massive hydrogen balloon sounds pretty easy , actually it was quite the opposite			0
' for the best part of two years , these things were able to fly over @entity29 , dropping bombs and causing havoc			2
' records have long suggested that the @entity2 used cow intestines to contain the hydrogen needed to make them fly but it had never been clear how this was achieved			0
destroyed : two workmen inspect the wreckage after a @entity67 damaged a house in @entity78 during @entity25 battlefield : @entity2 prisoners helping to carry wounded @entity29 soldiers back to their trenches after an attack near @entity109 during the @entity110 in 1916 sausage ban : the @entity112 was banned by the @entity7 in @entity55 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 dr @entity63 and his colleagues visited a sausage factory in @entity116 where they worked out that by making sausage skins wet , stretching them and allowing them to dry again , they could be bonded together to form ideal vessels for gas			1
conceived as a way to break @entity29 civilian morale , the @entity67 raids never caused enough casualties to alter the course of the war			1
but for civilians who witnessed them , the attacks , which began in january 1915 , were a shocking experience			0
@entity134 ’s @entity133 and other towns in east and southern @entity78 , including @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 , were targeted			0
because of their stealth , the attacks were difficult to counter and when the raids ended in 1917 , 77 of the 115 @entity2 airships had been shot down but 1,500 @entity29 citizens had been killed			1
dr @entity63 said : ' if you shoot a bullet at a balloon of hydrogen , all you get is a small hole			0
' there were 50 thousand cubic metres of gas in a @entity27 , and by putting a few holes in it , all you were doing was depriving it of a few cubic metres			2
it barely made any difference			0
' eventually an incendiary bullet which set the @entity27 alight was developed			0
it was not until he began filming the show that dr @entity63 discovered the bullets ’ designer was his own great uncle , @entity163			0
@entity164 will be shown on @entity43 on monday			0
horror of war : @entity29 troops are seen in @entity168 advancing on enemy lines during the @entity110 during @entity25			2

sausages were banned in @entity55 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 to help with the war effort
zeppelin attacks were used by the @entity7 to sap @entity29 morale
1,500 @entity29 citizens were killed in attacks by @entity27
