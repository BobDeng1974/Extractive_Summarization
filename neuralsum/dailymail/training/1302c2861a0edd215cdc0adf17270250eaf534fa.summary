' whether or not i could have prevented @entity1 , had i remained @entity2 , is an imponderable , ' @entity0 wrote			2
' at least i used any influence i had to warn against the folly of another hollocaust [ sic ]			0
' the @entity0 and @entity37 were warned against visiting @entity14 in 1937 , but they ignored official advice and paid a trip to the @entity41 's country retreat			1
@entity14 believed that @entity18 would not have declared war on @entity43 if @entity0 had remained @entity2 , and there have been rumours that he planned to depose @entity46 and reinstate his brother on the throne of a fascist @entity18			1
the former king told a friend years after the war that he ' never thought @entity14 was such a bad chap ' , while he and @entity27 are widely believed to have been sympathetic to the fascist cause			1
controversy : @entity0 , the @entity0 , and his wife @entity27 meeting @entity14 in @entity43 in 1937 @entity17 , to whom he wrote in 1970 , had even more extreme views , and was interned by the @entity18 government during both @entity58			1

@entity85 , an expert on the @entity86 , said : ' @entity17 was quite a controversial character and one that the @entity0 would have loved to have been involved with			1
' the idea that the @entity0 was an anti-establishment figure was one he liked to bandy about , especially in his later years , as we can see in this letter			2
' the line about whether he could have prevented war breaking out is an interesting one			0
in 1937 @entity0 went to @entity43 to see @entity14 on the advice of someone high up in the @entity99 embassy in @entity100			1
' @entity0 honestly thought he could talk @entity14 out of war which was pretty stupid but he felt that he had given it his best shot			1
