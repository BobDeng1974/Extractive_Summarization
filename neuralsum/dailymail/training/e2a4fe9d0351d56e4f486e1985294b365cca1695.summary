an @entity1 pharmaceuticals tycoon asked @entity3 's attorney general to review findings that his girlfriend killed herself by tying her wrists and ankles and hanging herself naked from a balcony of his historic mansion , according to a letter released on tuesday			1
@entity12 said he hoped the review would give ' confidence , comfort and resolution ' to those questioning whether @entity18 committed suicide on july 13 at his @entity21 mansion near @entity23			1
mr @entity12 , 54 , said he had no reason to doubt findings by authorities in @entity26 that his 32 - year - old girlfriend killed herself two days after his six - year - old son accidentally fell while under her watch and died days later			1
' i believe the only way to achieve some dignified resolution for everyone who has been touched by the horrible events of this summer will be through the efforts of your office , ' mr @entity12 wrote in a letter dated september 19 and released by his public relations firm on tuesday			1
@entity48 , a spokeswoman for @entity3 attorney general @entity49 , declined to comment beyond acknowledging the letter had been received			1
investigators believe ms @entity18 tied rope to bedposts and around her wrists and ankles			1
they suspect she loosely tied her wrists together in front of her before slipping one hand out , putting her hands behind her back and reinserting her wrist into the loop of rope			0
@entity65 fan : @entity66 was revealed to have broken his spinal cord in his fall , and was not breathing and had no pulse when he was found they said her dna was found on a knife , rope and bedposts , along with her footprints on a dusty balcony			0
ms @entity18 's family immediately questioned the findings disclosed on september 2 that included a video reenactment of how they think she bound her wrists			1
the anguished family is hoping the sheriff 's office will take another look at the case after the pink rope cops said she used to hang herself is not visible in a video released last week			1
mr @entity12 acknowledged in his letter that the circumstances of @entity18 's death were ' undeniably strange '			1
@entity18 family attorney @entity94 did not immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment on mr @entity12 's request			1
neither did officials with the @entity100 , which ruled her death a suicide			1
mr @entity12 is founder and chief executive of @entity104 , a company based in @entity105 , @entity1 , that makes acne treatments @entity106 and @entity108 and facial wrinkle treatment @entity109 and @entity111 , a competitor of @entity113			1
he owns the 27 - room waterfront mansion in @entity21 , where he lived during the summer with ms @entity18 , his girlfriend of two years			1
his son was from a marriage that ended in divorce in 2008			2
officers , however , admitted last monday that there were bruises on miss @entity18 's scalp and a t - shirt had been wrapped around her neck and stuffed in her mouth			1
police released the extra details about the autopsy report that concluded she had committed suicide , after parts were found to have been withheld from the public			2
they had come under pressure to release more information after findings leaked to the media showed that there were possible reasons to question the finding that she committed suicide			2
' as in any comprehensive investigation , some findings can not be entirely explained , ' an official said			0
death : @entity18 , 32 , left , died at the mansion of @entity12 , 54 , right in @entity21 , @entity3 , in july , just two days after his son @entity66 , 6 , who she was looking after , was gravely hurt from a fall off the stairs ' none of the observations listed ... are inconsistent with the conclusions reached regarding the cause and manner of death of @entity18			1
' dr @entity157 said the bruises were minor and may have been caused when ms @entity18 slipped over the balcony with the rope around her neck			2
the t - shirt in the mouth is not unusual , he added			2
' it is not clear why it was there , although people can place material in her mouth prior to hanging , ' he said			0
he said blood found on her thighs was not the result of rape but probably due to an intrauterine device or menstruation			0
despite those findings , a leading pathologist questioned the suicide conclusion			2
dr @entity180 , who has consulted on high profile cases including the assassination of president @entity183 , the drug overdose of @entity185 and the @entity187 case , said a number of factors in the ruling did not add up			2
while dr @entity180 stopped short of saying it was murder , he is not content to rule it a suicide			0
he said the report needed a lot more scrutiny			0
now you see it , now you do n't : the family of @entity18 want authorities to reopen the case after a video shows the same mansion balcony without the rope the sheriff 's office said she used to kill herself murder or suicide ? the ' pink rope , ' shown in this crime scene photo , is what police say @entity18 hanged herself with at her boyfriend 's @entity3 mansion tragic home : the historic 27 - room @entity219 mansion in @entity21 , an affluent suburb of @entity23 , where @entity12 's girlfriend was found hanging naked from above : an aerial view of the historic mansion in @entity3 where the tragedy happened in july ' when you put all of this together , it just is bothersome ' dr @entity180 told @entity228			1
' the manner of death i would have left as undetermined			0
' on the t - shirt , which was removed from her mouth by mr @entity12 's brother @entity235 when he cut her down , dr @entity180 told @entity228 : ' what does she care for that ? " @entity239 , i do n't want to wake anybody up who may come to rescue me			1
" ' i do n't know			0
i 'm just trying to think			0
she did n't want to be rescued and did n't want to scream so she put it in her mouth ? it 's absurd			0
' regarding the tape residue , dr @entity180 speculated miss @entity18 could have planned to bind her feet with duct tape and then switched to rope			2
but he added to @entity228 : ' well then , where 's the duct tape ? ' message : police covered the writing that appeared on a door in the mansion that allegedly said : ' she saved him , can he save her ' he also questioned why her feet were bound			2
and dr @entity180 was concerned by haemorrhages found under her scalp surface , saying it was evidence of blunt force trauma			0
' for someone to say there is n't any kind of struggle is not correct , ' he told @entity228			0
it was revealed on september 2 that before she died , miss @entity18 painted a message in black paint on a door			1
according to miss @entity18 's ex-husband , @entity271 , it read : ' she saved him , can he save her			1
' her family contends that she did not die by her own hand			0
ms @entity18 â€™s sister @entity274 said : ' @entity275 did not kill herself , someone killed her			2
' ' @entity277 will reveal who killed @entity275			0
i think i know who killed my sister			0
we are not stupid , she never had any enemies			0
' the family is calling for a forensic psychiatrist and a criminal profiler to investigate the case and say the cryptic message in black paint was not in her handwriting			2
but authorities said the paint from the message was still on her hands and on the rope when she died			0
the death of @entity298 , who fell over a staircase railing , was ruled an accident			0
his neck was broken and he was found not breathing and with no pulse by ms @entity18 at the bottom of the stairs after she heard a noise and came to look			2
she was the only adult at home at the time			0
two days later , @entity309 , called 911 to report that miss @entity18 appeared to be dead , investigators said			1
@entity12 was not at home as he was at his son 's hospital bedside when miss @entity18 's naked body was found hanging from the mansion 's balcony with her ankles and wrists bound , investigators were quick to say they were n't ruling out suicide			1
they eventually determined there was no evidence of foul play , sexual assault or a struggle , authorities said			0
she was alive when she went over the balcony and she died by hanging			0
there were no alcohol or drugs in her system			0
she died at about 3am and was found at 6.45am by @entity12 's brother @entity235 , who was staying in a mansion guesthouse			1

@entity66 was his only child with his second wife , @entity336 , whom he divorced in 2008 the home where the tragic incidents occurred , known as the @entity219 mansion , is one of the more storied properties in @entity21 , a small suburb of multimillion - dollar homes on the tip of a peninsula across a bay from downtown @entity23			2
