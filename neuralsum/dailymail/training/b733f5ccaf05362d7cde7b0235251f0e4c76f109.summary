by @entity0 published : 11:21 est , 13 april 2012 updated : 18:21 est , 15 april 2012 here ’s one answer to a strike by petrol - tanker drivers – a vehicle that does a whopping 584mpg			1
called the @entity6 – it was built by a team of engineers from the @entity10 for this year ’s @entity11 held in @entity12 , @entity13			1
the downside , however , is that there ’s only room for the driver			1
it ’s powered by a modified @entity27 generator and can hit 25mph flat out			1
its low fuel consumption is partly achieved by coasting			2
in posts to @entity34 's ‘ @entity35 ’ blog , driver @entity31 reported that , with the @entity6 ‘ we aimed to combine sleek aerodynamic shapes with ergonomic design in order to minimize weight ’			2
slow and steady : @entity6 will get you far - but can only reach 25mph the power plant : @entity6 's engine is a modified @entity27 generator wheel - y clever : the @entity6 demonstrates that gas - guzzling is strictly necessary the vehicle 's name is latin for ‘ thin layer , ' she noted			1
‘ we felt it described the vehicle 's bladelike lines and sharp styling			0
‘ the design begins with a @entity55 ( @entity55 ) model using @entity58 software			0
then comes extensive design reviews			0
finally , the whole project ends with the complete manufacturing of the vehicles done entirely on the @entity10 campus by students			0
’ @entity10 joined more than 1,000 high school and university students from throughout @entity68 who designed and built 113 vehicles to compete in one or both of the event 's two types of vehicle classes : prototype and @entity75			0
the teams can use either internal combustion or e-mobility energy sources , which include diesel , petrol , ethanol , fame , solar , hydrogen and battery electric technologies			0

it is powered by a modified @entity27 generator and can hit 25mph
