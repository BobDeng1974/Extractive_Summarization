by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 believes @entity4 new boy @entity3 is the best out and out striker in world football			1
@entity9 giants @entity4 have forked out £ 75million to land the @entity11 international despite the fact he has to serve a four - month ban for biting @entity15 's @entity14			1
however @entity2 believes @entity3 is worth the money as he is - in the @entity18 's opinion - the best goalscorer in world football when you take @entity21 and @entity22 out of the equation			1
he 's in your face , he 's arrogant in a good way , he can volley it , he can score headers			2
' he has that vicious side to his game			0
i will not call it cheating			0
he knows how to score goals			0
we have seen it against @entity53			0
they gave him two chances and he scored two goals			0
' @entity2 has also had his say on the everlasting debate regarding @entity22 and @entity21			1
current @entity59 captain @entity2 has revealed he thinks his former @entity4 teammate is the better player because he is ' naturally gifted '			1
' @entity21 is the best player in the world but i respect the amount of work @entity22 has put into the game , ' added @entity2			1
' but @entity21 is just a freak			2
it is nice for kids to watch as they can see one guy who was given a gift and the other guy who does it through hard work			0
' @entity73 used to tell me he was the hardest worker at @entity74			0
i am not saying @entity21 does not work hard - but it is more natural			2
' @entity22 had to work really hard to reach the top			2
they have the same mentality but that 's the difference			0
' close call : @entity22 ( left ) and @entity21 ( right ) are the best players in world football			1

@entity2 believes @entity3 has ' everything ' you need to be a top striker
@entity11 international @entity3 has *joined* @entity4 for £ 75milion
the former @entity89 striker rates @entity21 *ahead* of @entity22
