@entity0 faced further criticism on monday night after issuing a belated apology for biting @entity3 and promising never to be involved in such an incident again - just as @entity5 stepped up their bid to sign him			1
four days after receiving a four - month ban from the game and telling @entity11 that the clash during @entity15 ’s @entity14 match against @entity16 in @entity17 was an accident in which he ‘ lost balance ’ , the @entity8 striker made a complete u-turn and admitted he deeply regretted his actions			1
but the apology has led to widespread cynicism in the week that the 27 - year - old was linked with an £ 80million move to the @entity27			0
@entity28 , the former @entity5 striker , claimed the @entity30 giants had insisted that @entity0 say sorry if any potential transfer is to go through			1
‘ @entity54 from the fallout and the contradicting declarations that have surfaced during these past days , all of which have been without the intention of interfering with the good performance of my national team , the truth is that my colleague @entity3 suffered the physical result of a bite in the collision he suffered with me			0
‘ for this : i deeply regret what occurred			0
i apologise to @entity3 and the entire football family			2
i vow to the public that there will never again be another incident like this			0
’ @entity71 defender @entity3 retweeted @entity0 's apology on his own site , having previously said the four - month ban issued to @entity0 should not have been so severe			1
@entity3 also replied to the tweet directly , saying ' it 's all forgotten			1
i hope @entity11 will reduce your suspension			1
' he had previously said : ' at the moment my only thought is for @entity0 and his family , because they will face a very difficult period			0
' i have always considered unequivocal the disciplinary interventions by the competent bodies , but at the same time i believe that the proposed formula is excessive			0
' i sincerely hope that he will be allowed , at least , to stay close to his team mates during the games because such a ban is really alienating for a player			0
' video sorry @entity0 admits @entity3 bite accident ? @entity0 told @entity11 he did not deliberately bite @entity3 but fell on top of him suggestion : @entity28 says @entity5 may have forced the apology upon @entity0 in order for a transfer to occur although @entity5 have not yet submitted a formal bid , @entity8 are expecting contact soon , and , as @entity101 did when selling @entity102 to @entity103 last summer , will hope to bring in new recruits before agreeing any deal			1
@entity106 is set to complete the £ 25million signing of @entity109 ’s @entity108 on tuesday and is close to agreeing a £ 9.8m move for @entity112 striker @entity111 , while @entity114 ’s @entity113 is also a target			0
@entity0 ’s apology came just hours after @entity15 ’s president @entity117 had waded into the row by launching a foul - mouthed attack , calling @entity11 ‘ a bunch of old sons of b * * * * * s ’			1
painful : @entity0 fell to the ground and held his teeth straight after the encounter with centre back @entity3 the 79 - year - old described the punishment , which also included a suspension for nine international matches , as a ‘ fascist ban ’			2
he made the comments to state tv at a reception for the @entity15 team , following their elimination from the @entity14 by @entity137 on saturday			2
the president covered his mouth to feign shock at what he had said , but told journalists to ‘ publish it ’ when asked if he wanted to rectify his remarks			0
@entity145 admitted that @entity0 deserved to be disciplined , but said his suspension was too harsh			2
‘ they could have punished him , but not given him this fascist ban , ’ he said			0
if he remains at @entity8 , @entity0 will miss the first nine games of the league season and return to action on october 26			2
about time : @entity0 has delayed his apology to @entity3 but has promised he will never behave like that again accepted : @entity3 is yet to criticise @entity0 , and instead says the ban should be reduced homeward bound : @entity0 waves to @entity160 fans after he was banished from the @entity14 in @entity161 fury : @entity117 has called @entity11 ' a bunch of old sons of b * * * * * s ' in an attack on football 's governing body			1
