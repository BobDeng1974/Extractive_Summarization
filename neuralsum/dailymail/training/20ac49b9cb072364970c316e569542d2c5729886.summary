by @entity0 published : 12:12 est , 18 march 2013 updated : 14:26 est , 18 march 2013 the @entity2 start - up which wants to make 3d - printable firearm blueprints available for free online has received a license to allow it to make and sell guns			2
@entity8 , founder and figurehead of @entity10 , posted a picture of the @entity12 ( @entity13 ) on the group 's facebook page			1
a note attached to the picture read : ' look who now has a license to manufacture firearms ! the work begins ! ' free to download : @entity8 , founder of @entity10 , tests out a 3d - printed magazine for an @entity25 semi-automatic rifle			1
he has now been granted a license to make and sell guns the license granted by the @entity2 agency of @entity30 now gives mr @entity8 government approval to make and distribute guns			1
mr @entity8 told @entity32 : ' the big thing it allows me to do is that it makes me manufacture under the law â€” everything that manufacturers are allowed to do			2
' i can sell some of the pieces that we 've been making			0
i can do firearms transactions and transport			0
' @entity10 has already made several prototypes of 3d - printable gun parts , including for the @entity25 semi-automatic rifle , which is allowed under @entity2 law without a license			0
the group has made its blueprints available as free downloads via its own distribution website after other 3d printing websites decided to remove the files			0
however , the new license allows mr @entity8 to make and distribute actual finished firearms			1
licensed gunsmith : the license allows @entity58 law student mr @entity8 ( pictured ) to make , transport and sell weapons			1
last year @entity61 described him as one of the world 's 15 most dangerous people the @entity58 - based law student , who @entity61 last year described as one of the 15 most dangerous people in the world , told @entity32 that he had applied to the @entity30 for his type 7 license in october 2012			0
applications for the licenses usually take around 60 days , but mr @entity8 's took a whole six months to come through			1
@entity10 's aim , according to its website , is to extend the rights to bear arms guaranteed by the @entity2 @entity78 's @entity77 to the entire world			2
' the work begins ' : mr @entity8 posted this picture of his recently granted @entity12 on the defense distributed facebook page since beginning operations last year , the group has , perhaps unsurprisingly , had to overcome range of legal problems and moral objections which threatened to derail their project			1
they have had their blueprints removed from @entity96 - file search engine @entity94 , their account on a crowd - funding website frozen and funds returned to donors , and companies from which they planned to lease equipment repossessing their printers			0
two @entity58 - based companies , whose names are not known , have since volunteered space and a 3d printer for the team to carry out manufacturing and ballistics testing			0
mr @entity8 said he will not actually start making and selling guns until he receives an ' add - on ' to his license which will allow him to deal in a broader range of firearms , including fully automatic weapons			2
with that permission in place , he hopes to beginning selling guns to offset the costs of the @entity10 project .			0
