@entity39 , director of @entity40 , said : ' it looks like he had some sort of attack while underwater and tragically he died as a result			1
the coastguards and police have impounded the tanks he was using but that 's just a technicality as it looks like he had a heart attack			2
' he was an experienced diver but this was his first time out here			2
he was in a group of other divers from @entity55 and his wife @entity56 was on the mainland			2
she 's very upset as you can imagine			2
' when he came to the surface he was already out cold			1
we dragged him onto the boat and i carried out a heart massage and gave him oxygen but sadly there was nothing we could do			2
' mr @entity9 , who was originally from @entity68 but lived in @entity69 , arrived in @entity7 last week and he and the rest of the group were with instructors from a local firm called @entity74			1

the ship he was diving in was a steamship called the @entity23 , which was torpedoed by the @entity82 's @entity81 in may 1941 and sank within ten minutes of being struck			0
it was primarily used as a troopship but at the time was empty and sailing between its home port of @entity88 and the @entity38 city of @entity90			0
divers are drawn to the wreck because at the time it was sunk it was carrying a large cargo of glassware products			0
idyllic : crystal clear waters at @entity35 in @entity38 , @entity7 the wreck is about a mile from the uninhabited @entity29			0
@entity74 's website says : ' it is one of the most beautiful wreck ( sic ) in the @entity32 : the holds loaded with glasses , the majesty of the screw and the poop cannon remain engraved on the diver 's memory			0
it is a fascinating dive , but only for the very experienced divers			0
' today , a coastguard spokesman in @entity90 said : ' we were called to an incident involving a group of divers who had been at the wreck of the @entity23			0
' it appears that one of them , a @entity4 man , was in difficulty and when he got to the surface he was already unconscious			1
' the paramedics tried to save him but he was declared dead at the scene			0
it looks like he suffered a heart attack			0
' mr @entity9 's body is expected to be moved to @entity90 , where a magistrate will decide if a post mortem should be held			1
