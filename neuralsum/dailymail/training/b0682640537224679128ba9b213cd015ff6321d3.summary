miss @entity13 disclosed its existence while being interviewed for the documentary , @entity45 , which was shown on monday			2
mr @entity2 branded her ‘ nothing more than another sick friend to @entity15 ’ , adding on his website : ‘ @entity13 , you are			1
a self - important , callous twisted individual with no heart and a very empty soul , just like @entity15			2
’ tragic : @entity2 's mother @entity53 on @entity54 , where her son is believed to be buried			1
she died at the weekend without ever knowing the truth he said miss @entity13 and former religious studies teacher dr @entity56 , another @entity15 confidant interviewed in the film , ‘ should be in @entity58 [ the secure hospital where @entity15 is held ] themselves ’			1
miss @entity13 was unavailable for comment yesterday			0
she has claimed that she told police about @entity15 ’s letter two weeks before her arrest , but officers from the cold case unit were not interested			2
‘ it is no surprise at all that @entity15 was / is willing to sit and talk to the likes of these people , ’ he wrote			0
‘ they should be in @entity58 themselves or some other institution to try and help with their problems , although they may well be beyond any help at all			0
’ and he concluded : ‘ @entity78 and @entity56 you are both a total and utter disgrace			0
‘ you sicken and disgust me more than i could ever say , just like the rest of the @entity15 ’s sympathisers and friends			0

he added that her role as an executor of @entity15 ’s will represented ‘ a big conflict of interest ’			0
‘ either she had a formal role , which would involve someone supervising her , and which apparently did n’t happen , or she ’d be better described as a long - term visitor or friend , ’ he said			0
mr @entity108 criticised @entity18 for not querying her claim to be @entity15 ’s formal mental health advocate , saying her behaviour ‘ tarnished ’ the reputation of thousands of well - intentioned professionals			1
the health of 74 - year - old @entity15 is reported to be fading after 13 years on hunger strike , with injuries he sustained after a seizure at the secure hospital in @entity134 last month meaning he is now too ill to be force - fed. @entity2 was on his way to visit his grandmother ’s house in @entity138 , @entity139 when he vanished on june 16 , 1964			1
his mother died at a hospice on saturday after a long battle with cancer without being informed of the latest developments in the hunt for his body			2
