normally it is defenders who like to put in the first tackle on a striker to make their point			0
with @entity5 it is the other way around			1
he is bristling for a fight and almost wants defenders to make him angry because when he is fired up he is an even better player			0
to deal with @entity5 you have to show you have more than him in every department			1
you have to be stronger , quicker and must anticipate better than him			1
@entity5 could now face a three - game ban after being charged by the @entity12 for his stamp on can @entity5 and @entity15 's @entity14 square up after the other stamp incident during tuesday night 's clash you have to do your work early and try to get in ahead of him			1
that can be a gamble because if he gets away , there is no catching @entity5			2
there is no question you have to match his physicality , even if it means risking being booked or sent off			2
he wants to rumble and you have to stand up to that			0
but he is more than just a brute			0
he links intelligently , has great skill and has all the potential to be as good as , if not better than , @entity31			0
@entity5 showed his dark side with this stamp on @entity14 , for which he was somehow not sent off			2

@entity5 faces a three - match ban for violent conduct on tuesday night
the @entity40 striker stamped on @entity15 's @entity41 during their *win*
@entity5 is always up for a fight on the *pitch* and provides sheer physicality
you have to be stronger , quicker and anticipate better to beat @entity5
