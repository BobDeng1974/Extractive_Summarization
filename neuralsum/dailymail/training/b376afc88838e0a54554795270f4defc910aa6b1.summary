with no political experience and little knowledge of economics , performing arts professor @entity0 was already an unlikely candidate for the @entity5 presidential election			1
the fact that 90 per cent of his body is covered in tattoos makes it even more surprising that not only is he standing for election - he currently stands third in the polls			0
one in nine voters are believed to be planning on backing the 53 - year - old opera composer and painter in this weekend 's presidential elections after a £ 15,000 election campaign that did n't even include posters			1
leading candidates @entity31 and @entity32 , both former prime ministers , ought to be keen to benefit from his following if the vote goes to a second round			0
and mr @entity0 , a professor at @entity39 's @entity38 , is not short of admirers			1
in a country where voters are increasingly tired of corrupt politicians who , they say , fail to keep promises more than two decades after the fall of communism , mr @entity0 's agenda of promoting human rights , democracy and green energy policies has made an impact			1
‘ the ( political ) system is so enchanted with itself that it has lost the ability to self - reflect , ’ he said in an interview yesterday			2
' @entity5 are fed up with this c * * p. ’ double figures : @entity0 , seen smiling prior to a rehearsal of his opera ' @entity60 ' at the @entity61 in @entity39 , @entity5 yesterday , is predicted 11 per cent in the first round of voting this weekend competition : both @entity31 , left , and @entity32 , right , are former prime ministers of the @entity5 mr @entity0 says he only threw his hat in the ring after a group of admirers established the @entity0 for president initiative and begged him to shake up the race through his shock factor			1
but he 's stirred up such goodwill that a leading economist offered his services for free and his campaign workers are also volunteers			1
he 's only spent £ 15,575 ( $ 25,000 ) from donations on his campaign and has n't put up any posters			1
changes ; @entity0 says @entity5 are fed up with the current political system @entity0 burst onto the political scene with an eye - catching 88,000 signatures from the public at the end of 2012 - far more than the 50,000 required by law			1
not affiliated with any party , he has campaigned mostly on a platform highlighting graft , the importance of education and the nation 's moral standing			2
he 's proven particularly popular with young voters - and those not yet eligible to cast a ballot			2
in a mock presidential election at 441 high schools across the country a month before the vote , @entity0 won by a landslide , garnering more than 40 per cent of some 60,000 votes			1
and , perhaps surprisingly , few take issue with his tattoos			0
‘ personally , i would n't vote for him - but ( the tattoos ) are not a problem at all , ’ said @entity106 , a 33 - year - old it specialist from @entity39			0
‘ the young people prefer him because they do n't have a better choice			0
’ ‘ the tattoo does n't make any difference , ’ said @entity112 , a student in @entity39 , adding a lack of experience in politics was more an issue			2
for the first time , the @entity5 president will be elected in a popular vote - a new system that makes it possible for independent candidates like @entity0 to run for the largely ceremonial post			1
@entity126 , the incumbent , opposed the change , calling it ‘ a fatal mistake ’ and said he feared the likes of @entity0 might succeed him			1
a total of nine candidates are running			0
unlike the @entity133 who attacked the @entity134 at every opportunity , the favorites , @entity32 and @entity31 , have a more moderate approach to the bloc which the country joined in 2004			0
@entity32 , the leftist premier in 1998 - 02 , leads the polls with about 25 per cent support			0
@entity31 , a centrist and a former state bureaucrat , gained significant popularity when he led a caretaker government in 2009 - 10			0
he polls at about 20 per cent			0
back to basics : classical music composer , painter and opera singer @entity0 has little knowledge of economics , but promotes human rights , democracy and renewable energy disapproval : incumbent president @entity126 called the introduction of a popular vote and allowing independent candidates such as mr @entity0 , was a ' fatal mistake ' as the campaign approached its end on tuesday , eight candidates were busy drumming up votes			1
the ninth - @entity0 - had other matters to deal with : a final rehearsal of his opera , @entity60 , at the @entity61			2
torn between art and politics , @entity0 cut short his appearance at an election debate to return to the opera house that is part of @entity39 's @entity170			1
but he committed to staying to the end of thursday 's final televised debate			2
it was n't an easy choice , but he realized his credibility demanded that he take part			0
‘ for a @entity5 composer to have a world premiere in the @entity179 is something extraordinary			0
i had to make a choice between a service to the public and the fulfillment of my life - long dream			0
i 've made the choice and will be at the debate			0

tattooed presidential candidate @entity0 may become kingmaker
third place for this weekend 's elections after *poster-less* campaign
performing arts professor , *nicknamed* ' @entity196 ' , has no political experience
