by @entity0 ask me if i ’m a bag or a shoes girl and i ’ll say shoes every time			1
they are the first thing i notice about another woman ’s outfit and the one thing in my own wardrobe i ’ll splash money on			2
furthermore , after years working on glossy women ’s magazines , i like to think i can spot designer shoes at 30 paces			2
from the cut of the leather to the detailing and shade of the dye , i ’ve always believed it was easy when it came to sorting budget from luxury labels			2
in the past few months i ’ve been taken in by more bargain basement styles than i care to mention			1
so , am i wasting my money on designer footwear ? should i be heading for the budget shoe departments this spring ? and can cheap shoes ever be as comfortable as expensive ones ? i decided to find out			2
my challenge was to road - test five key styles for this season - in each case trying on one pair costing less than £ 30 and another with a three - figure price tag			1
could you tell the difference ? @entity36 ( right ) failed to live up to its £ 10 competitors from @entity38 ( left ) @entity39 @entity38 : £ 10 @entity41 sole : £ 120 style : @entity41 @entity42 is the @entity43 of flats , loved by @entity45 and @entity46			1
i buy a pair every spring and wear them so often i feel i can justify the cost			1
so , it ’s remarkable @entity38 ’s snake - effect fabric ( left ) looks very like the @entity41 @entity36 leather ( right ) and is almost as butter soft			1
who ’d have thought cheap shoes could be so chic ? cut & fit : the front of the @entity38 shoe comes much higher up the foot , which could cause blisters			2
but they are wide across your feet , meaning you will keep the circulation in your little toes			2
as with a real ballet shoe , the drawstring on the @entity41 @entity36 style can be tightened to give a perfect fit			1
winner : @entity38 almost identical to its @entity73 ( left ) rival the @entity76 and @entity77 ( right ) kitten heels are over six times the price kitten heels @entity73 : £ 27 @entity81 : £ 175 style : the @entity73 heels ( above left ) are a more flattering nude shade than the more expensive pair ( right )			1
they ’ll bring a bit of warmth to a pale skin tone			2
the strap sits across the front of the foot rather than around the ankle , which is better for someone with curvy calves as it lengthens the leg			2
i ’m disappointed in the oddly cheap looking @entity81 pair			1
cut & fit : the @entity73 leather might not be real , but it ’s baby soft and these shoes feel like slippers			0
i ’m guessing they would n’t stand up to rough treatment but they ’re a joy to walk in and a perfect size 5			0
though the shoes are pointy , the front is cut low so there ’s no uncomfortable rubbing across the big toe joint			0
the fit of the @entity81 pair is good , but i ’m not sure what justifies the hefty price tag			1
winner : @entity73 although the overall look of @entity122 pair ( right ) was more sophisticated @entity0 says the fit was awful glitter courts @entity125 : £ 14.99 @entity126 : £ 195 style : the @entity125 glitter ( left ) is much more obvious than on the @entity122 pair ( right ) , which have a sophisticated sheen rather than in - your - face sparkle			1
the cheap ones look as if they belong in a strip club and the platform sole at the front is n’t helping			0
cut & fit : the @entity125 shoes look like something you ’d see on a panto dame , but they are remarkably comfortable			0
but i ’d challenge anyone who knew their shoes not to pick these out as the cheap ones			0
however , the @entity122 heels are absolutely tiny			0
my feet are on the small side of size five , but this pair is virtually impossible to get on			1
when i do manage to shoehorn my feet in , my little toes scream in agony			0
yes , they may be beautiful , but sadly they are totally unwearable			0
winner : @entity125 , available at @entity156 @entity0 says the @entity158 pair ( right ) cut in uncomfortably and gape around the side of the foot wedged heels @entity158 : £ 25 @entity162 : £ 100 style : the @entity164 ( left ) feels and looks saggy			1
as for the height - oh dear , what is going on here ? it ’s almost as though the designers were going for a flatform ( a one - height raised sole ) , but they chickened out at the last minute and went for a wedge instead			0
the @entity162 wedges ( right ) in attractive red patent have a cork look sole			0
cut & fit : the @entity176 peep - toe cuts in uncomfortably just at the base of the nail of my big toe and the suedette bags and gapes around the side of my foot			0
sorry - i ca n’t see a reason to buy these shoes when there are plenty of good wedges out there			0
the @entity162 slingback sits comfortably at the top of the heel and does n’t dig into the tendon ( which can be a problem with cheaper , badly cut styles )			1
the peep - toe is well - cut , too			0
though these shoes will give you lots of height , they also feel secure			0
i could run for a bus in this pair			1
winner : @entity162 @entity0 said that the @entity205 pair looked promising but scuffed almost immediately after putting them on @entity208 @entity207 new look : £ 14.99 @entity210 : £ 195 style : the @entity205 suedette fabric ( above left ) is a nice inky black in the box , but they scuff almost as soon as i put them on			1
and i find myself continually adjusting the double - straps to get them an equal distance @entity222 wider heels and more sensible single ankle strap of the @entity225 ( above right ) make them more of a day / work sandal than glamorous evening shoes			0
cut & fit : the @entity205 sandals are unforgiving across the front , leading to dead little toes			0
this is a bit of a let - down as lots of the cheaper shoes i ’ve admired on friends have turned out to be from @entity205 , so i ’m disappointed these ones were n’t better			0
the @entity210 leather is strong enough to make your feet feel as if they ’re going to stay put ( important when you ’re wearing a heel this high ) , but is equally soft enough to be @entity246 ’s nothing wrong with these shoes , but they ’re rather run of the mill to justify the nearly £ 200 price tag			1

@entity0 tries some of the most *popular* styles available
she has tested high end against high street and the results may shock you
a pair of snake print ballet flats beat off a pair 12 times the price
