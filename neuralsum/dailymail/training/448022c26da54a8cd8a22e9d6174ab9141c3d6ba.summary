by @entity0 when was the last time you had sex so good , you did n't stop grinning at each other for days ? ok , how about reasonably good sex that left you with a rather smug post-coital glow ? hmm			1
then how many of you fantasise more about sleeping in your bed than bouncing around on it ? @entity0 says that a low libido can effect us all from time to time but there are plenty of ways to get yourself back in the mood stressful jobs , fractious relationships , parenting , that monotonous commute - all combine to rob us of desire			1
if sex is just another chore rather than something you look forward to , chances are one or more of the following is to blame			2

@entity38 sleep leads to a reduction in the male hormone testosterone , which boosts both your libidos			1
take responsibility for your libido			2
do n't expect your partner to turn you on , do it yourself ! make it your mission to pinpoint what gets you in the mood for sex then do more of it			1
do n't be ashamed of your fantasies and refuse to feel guilty if having sex with someone other than your partner is one of them			1
being unfaithful in reality is n't on but it 's ok to do it in your head			2
one survey found around 75 % of us do it to keep sex fresh			2
if you do n't want intercourse , what about oral sex ? if you do n't want oral sex or any sex yourself , do you mind pleasuring them ? at the very least , you can and should be able to offer the physical intimacy of a cuddle			0
@entity0 says that it 's important to approach the subject rather than avoid it focus on sex , do n't avoid it			1
if you 're constantly being hassled for it , sex is often the last thing you want to watch or read about			1
low libido people often avert their eyes when they see nudity , a sexy scene on telly or in the movies or flip the page if they hit a story in the newspapers or glossies			1
it 's just as easy to think yourself into sex than it is to talk yourself out of it and the more often you expose yourself to sexy literature and images , the sexier you 'll feel			2
know what you want and need to be satisfied sexually			0
and i 'm talking both in , and out of , bed			0

well – gosh ! – funnily enough , even high sex drive people sometimes wonder if it 's worth the effort when they 're exhausted after a long day at work			1
get into a routine where you and your partner have chat - time then sex before you start dinner and switch the tv on			1
or if you really are too stressed during the week , have breakfast in bed on the weekends and make that sex time			0
get your body clocks in sync			0
a morning person matched with a night time one ? if this is you , take turns on the time of day you make love			0
and try sex mid morning , midday and mid afternoon , not just morning or night sex does not equal intercourse			2
plenty of people ( women especially ) do n't orgasm through intercourse alone , so tend to find penetrative sex quite boring			1
if sex is boring , it 's no wonder you 're not desperate to dive into bed ! the more you mix up what you do , the higher the interest			2
do n't relax ! instead , focus on the erotic sensations you 're feeling			0
tighten the muscles of your thighs , bottom , lower tummy and pelvic floor muscles to help trigger an orgasmic reflex			0
set up a craving cycle			0
without wanting to point out the obvious , orgasms feel good			0
if something feels good , our body – quite logically – says ' more please ' and sulks if we do n't obey by developing either psychological or physical cravings when denied its high			1
the more sex you have , the more you want			0
we quickly forget how great sex can be			0
have good sex often and you 're constantly reminded of all the physical and emotional pluses			2
