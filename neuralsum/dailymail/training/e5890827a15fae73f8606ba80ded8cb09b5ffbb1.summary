by @entity0 it 's a new series that follows the fortunes of a group of senior executives as the @entity6 lurches from one crisis to another			1
but this is no fly - on - the - wall documentary showing how the @entity11 is trying to tackle its problems : this is a comedy that makes light of a series of scandals that have cost licence fee payers millions of pounds			1
in one episode , real @entity6 executive @entity18 makes a cameo appearance , where he is seen arm - wrestling with novelist @entity22			1
executive decision : @entity24 , centre , a @entity6 official @entity24 in the forthcoming comedy @entity26 @entity26 , which will be broadcast later this month , stars @entity28 ’s @entity24 , and several of the characters and storylines bear a striking similarity to real people and events			1
@entity24 plays @entity24 , who has been hired to chart a new course for the @entity6 in light of what are described as ‘ recent learning opportunities ’			1

the presenter won her case and returned to work at the @entity6			2
taking the strain : @entity22 , left , and the @entity6 's @entity18 in the comedy series the comedy : @entity24 ’s character @entity24 , newly appointed as @entity77 , has been brought in to turn around the beleaguered corporation in the light of a wave of scandals or ‘ specific learning opportunities ’			1
