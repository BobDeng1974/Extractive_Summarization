' ms @entity103 said the party was working up three principles on welfare ahead of the general @entity128 added : ' one , that work should pay , secondly , there should be obligation to take work and thirdly that there should be support through a contributory principle for people putting into the system as well as taking out			1

' there have been examples of people who have come to the country for extraordinarily short periods of time who have had a relationship breakdown and then they end up in our courts at our expense to determine custody of the children			0
' this will exclude people who enter the country illegally , who up to now have been able to access our legal aid system in a way i do n't think should ever have happened			1
' mr @entity25 also said he wants to curb the criminal legal aid bill , telling the newspaper nobody whose earnings came from the public sector ' should reasonably expect ' to top the prime minister 's £ 142,000 annual salary			1
