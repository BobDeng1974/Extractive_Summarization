by @entity1 reporter published : 08:22 est , 13 november 2013 updated : 11:44 est , 13 november 2013 professional concert pianist @entity2 is facing up to seven years in prison if found guilty of causing ' psychological injury ' and noise pollution by practicing a professional concert pianist faces seven years in prison after her neighbour said the daily practice sessions caused ' psychiatric injury '			1
@entity11 claims @entity2 played the instrument eight hours a day , five days a week in the apartment below hers in @entity15 , @entity16			1
despite experts saying the practice was quieter than a spoken conversation , ms @entity11 says she now suffers from a range of problems caused by the ' noise pollution '			1
ms @entity2 , 27 , is being tried along with her parents , @entity24 and @entity25 , in the northeastern city of @entity27			1
ms @entity11 , who lived above the @entity24 family , claims she suffered noise pollution from 2003 to 2007 the pianist denies playing at home that often , saying she took regular classes in other towns			1
she claims she mostly practiced at home on the weekends			0
on monday , the first day of the trial , the @entity37 newspaper reported that ms @entity11 told the court she now hates pianos so much she can not even stand to see them in a film			1
the prosecution claims that years of hearing constant playing has caused her ' psychological injury			1
' medical reports showed she suffered from a variety of problems , including insomnia , anxiety , panic attacks and gynecological problems			2
ms @entity11 and her family moved in 2007 and she says she has had to take time off work because of her problems			2
the prosecutor said tests by local authorities found that the sound levels made by the piano were repeatedly up to 10 decibels higher than the 30 - decibel limit laid down for musical instruments in the town			2
city authorities asked the family several times to either stop the piano playing or soundproof the room			0
the family told the court they carried out soundproofing work twice but the complaints continued , the newspaper reported			0
@entity75 , an environmental scientist at the @entity76 , said noise around 40 decibels ' is not very much			0
' @entity24 , father @entity78 and mother @entity25 are being tried on noise pollution charges because former neighbour said she has suffered long term problems as a result of the pianist playing the instrument a normal conversation produces 55 - 60 decibels , with noise in a bar reaching 65 - 70 decibels and an airplane in flight producing 110 - 120 decibels , she said			1
however , she also noted that some studies have established links to health problems such as sleep disturbances and cardiovascular disease if someone faces a constant noise level of over 40 decibels during the night			0
' the norm is for 30 decibels as a nighttime limit inside a house , but some authorities are widening it to daytime , which is surprising , ' said @entity105 , a constitutional law professor at @entity106			0
he said that may be due to the high fines that courts have forced some towns to pay for not taking action against excessive noise levels			0
' protection against noise and environmental quality is considered a human right , ' he said			0
the prosecutors have asked for all three defendants to be sentenced to six years in jail for noise pollution and an additional one - and - a - half years for psychological damage			2
they have also demanded that all three be prohibited from playing the piano professionally for four years			2
