a @entity1 mp has urged his supporters not to ' mention the @entity1 or @entity3 ' when sending out letters in support of him			1
@entity7 , who is fighting the key @entity8 marginal of @entity9 , has asked constituents to sign letters to friends and neighbours supporting his re-election			1
but mr @entity7 was left red - faced after it emerged he sent out ' sample ' letters designed to make it look like they were written by ordinary constituents			1
@entity7 , who is fighting the key @entity8 marginal of @entity9 , has asked constituents to sign letters to friends and neighbours supporting his re-election the letters , seen by the @entity24 , all appeared to be written in exactly the same style			1
they were full of similar phrases – with each beginning with ' dear neighbour ' and went on to describe an incident where mr @entity7 helped them			2
they often ended with the phrase : ' i really ca n't recommend @entity7 strongly enough			2
' in a letter to constituents asking them to endorse him , mr @entity7 writes : ' i 'm not asking you to write a political letter — in fact , it 'll be much more effective if it does n't mention the @entity1 or @entity3			1
' asked if he or his team wrote the sample letters , he said : ' people write their own letters , i 've not written anything			2
these are genuine constituents that we have helped who wanted to write a letter			2
i think in one case we helped with the drafting			0
they are not fake letters			2
' ' i 'm therefore writing to ask if you would be prepared to write to people in your neighbourhood saying why you think i am a good local mp			0
' one labour mp compared his letter with the bungling @entity60 manager @entity59 telling staff ' do n't mention the war ' in front of @entity65 guests			0
mr @entity7 has urged his supporters not to ' mention the @entity1 or @entity3 ' when sending out letters in support of him @entity70 mp @entity69 mocked : ' it 's a case of ' do n't mention the @entity72 ! ' mr @entity7 insisted he just did not want the endorsements to be too political and that he had put mr @entity3 on his own leaflets			1
he said : ' the purpose is not to send political letters			0
the purpose of the letters is a personal endorsement of my work as mp			0
' my own election leaflets will be full of mentions of both @entity3 and the @entity1			1
' these letters are different			0
they are from ordinary people telling their story			0
i do n't think people doing that will be comfortable making party political points			0
' but @entity91 , the @entity70 candidate for @entity92 , told the @entity24 : ' it 's a sign of real desperation that @entity7 is actively telling people not to call him a @entity1			1
he 's trying to pull the wool over people 's eyes			0
' if people were wondering if the @entity1 brand had become toxic in @entity9 , he 's the proof you need			1
' however hard he tries , he ca n't run away from his voting record — voting for deep cuts , privatisation of the @entity104 , the bedroom tax and trebling tuition fees			0
