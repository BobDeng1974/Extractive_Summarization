more than two thirds of top - level managers across @entity4 want a winter break , a @entity1 study has revealed			1
a number of head coaches from across the continent , covering 20 different nationalities , were polled and the proposition of a mid-season rest period won resounding favour			1
in another key finding the majority of managers would like the transfer window to remain open all season so signings can be made at any time			0
give it a rest ! @entity23 manager @entity22 has long been a vocal supporter of winter breaks the results come in the @entity26 , which quizzes bosses on a variety of topics including the introduction of technology in football , which 93 per cent of respondents agreed was a positive step			1
but it is the clear backing for a winter break – 70 per cent are in favour – that could gain most traction and potentially force a change in @entity43 scheduling			2
@entity22 has long called for the move in @entity46 football and last april claimed @entity48 teams ’ recent success was down to the @entity50 operating a six - week pause between mid-december and late january			2
‘ when you are an @entity46 club or a @entity54 club , you have a handicap - that is for sure , ’ he said			0
@entity58 was said to have suffered this season after a sparkling start to life in @entity46 because he was unable to rest midway through and fatigue set in			0
and most of the continent ’s top coaches agree with @entity22			2
the other interesting development is that the majority of managers want an transfer window open all year long			0
exhibit a : @entity58 's dip in form towards the end of the season has been blamed on lack of rest in agreement : @entity78 ( @entity79 ) and @entity80 would both support a season - long transfer window increasingly those in charge at @entity43 clubs have bemoaned the summer and winter windows as unnecessarily prohibitive , claiming prices are pushed up , panic increases and agents prosper			1
@entity78 and @entity80 , two unlikely bedfellows , are in agreement on this issue			0
other results of the survey found that 67 per cent of respondents considered the recruitment of players as becoming the most important part of the job and 73 per cent opposed the idea of the introduction of an orange card to be given to players with a yellow card as a ‘ final warning ’			1
sir @entity104 , an @entity1 board member , said the poll was important , while @entity106 insisted the results should be listened to			1
‘ football is a universal language and the collection of such information is invaluable , ’ @entity104 said			0
worth it : former @entity113 manager @entity104 insists the @entity1 report contains important findings ‘ this survey covers leadership and management as well as other key technical issues in football so it deals with the issues that affect managers each and every day			1
‘ the findings of this survey are particularly intriguing and demonstrate the range of views across @entity4 football			0
’ @entity131 manager @entity106 added : ‘ as the role of a manager and coach continues to evolve in the modern game it is vital that our views are not just collected but considered as , despite the range of models across @entity4 , the manager / head coach maintains responsibility for results .			0
