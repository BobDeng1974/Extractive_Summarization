@entity0 will promise new fathers six weeks of paternity leave if his party gets into government for a second term @entity0 will promise new fathers six weeks of paternity leave if his party gets into government for a second term			1
the @entity10 would triple the amount of leave for dads of newborns from the current two weeks – and pay them the maternity leave rate of £ 138.18 a week			1
it will be seen as a bid to woo women voters and young families ahead of the general election , but will face concerns from the business community			0
mr @entity0 has already pushed for shared parental leave , which starts from next week ( april 5 )			1
it means parents can split a year off work between them at statutory pay			2
this means that a mother who wishes to end her maternity leave – and pay – early to return to work , can hand over their entitlement to the child ’s father			1
but mr @entity0 and the business minister @entity36 announced today that fathers can have an extra four weeks leave at home with the child ’s mother , and both would be entitled to pay			1
mr @entity0 believes the two - week period fathers get is often treated as a holiday , and extending it would encourage men to be more involved in childcare			1
the policy will be in the party ’s manifesto and would be introduced in 2018 - 19 after consultation with businesses			0
they hope half a million fathers would benefit from the scheme which would cost £ 58million a year , and be paid for once the deficit is cleared			0
mr @entity0 said today : ‘ the @entity10 want to tear down the barriers that stop people reaching their full potential			1
for too long , mums have been told their place is at home with their child , while dads return to work			0
i want parents to choose for themselves how to balance work and family			0
’ the entitlement would be under a ‘ use it or lose it ’ basis so fathers must start their six weeks ’ leave within eight weeks of their child ’s birth and can not transfer it to the mother			0
mr @entity0 was promoting his policy to treble paternity leave to six weeks with @entity10 minister @entity36 ( right ) as he visited @entity77 soft play centre in @entity78 , @entity79 @entity80 have already pledged to increase paid paternity leave to four weeks – and increase paternity pay - which triggered criticism from small businesses that the costs would be prohibitive			1
but @entity10 sources said the policy would help businesses retain staff who wanted to take time off with their families			1
around 55pc of fathers take the full two weeks currently available			0
one of mr @entity0 ’s early schemes , in 2011 , to encourage parents to share their time off – called @entity95 – was a flop after being found to have an uptake of only 1pc			2
@entity10 sources said : ‘ there was low uptake of that scheme because it was n’t paid , so families made decisions based on their finances			2
and of course there was also a cultural barrier			0
‘ but we believe six weeks of paternity leave on statutory pay will be popular and help to change attitudes			2
there has been no greater champion for this in government than @entity36 , she pushed for six weeks paternity leave in government but the @entity132 blocked it			2
’ the scheme is modelled on a similar one in @entity134 in which fathers get a ‘ daddy month ’ and also the right to shared leave for more than a year			2
uptake is high because fathers are entitled to 90pc of their full pay			0
but miss @entity36 said yesterday that the aim was to ‘ challenge the gender stereotypes that all too often write fathers off as hapless or bumbling ’			0
she added : ‘ @entity10 want to triple paternity leave , to encourage new dads to spend more time with their child in those vital early weeks and month after birth			1
most fathers want to spend more time with their new baby – and we know it makes a positive difference for children when they do			0
