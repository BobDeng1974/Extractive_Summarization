for the first time in a decade , astronomers have found dwarf galaxies orbiting the @entity3 - an unprecedented nine in total			1
they range in distance from 95,000 to 1.2 million light - years , and each contain far fewer stars than our galaxy			1
crucially , though , the dwarf galaxies could help test theories of dark matter and perhaps bring us a step closer to detecting the elusive particles			1
move the slider below to see an image of the southern sky before and after the new dwarf galaxies are added astronomers have found nine new dwarf galaxies in orbit around the @entity3			1
they are the first to be discovered orbiting our galaxy in more than a decade			2
this image shows the previously known @entity23 with six of the nine newly discovered dwarf galaxies above the @entity25 in @entity26 the discovery was made by a team of astronomers at the @entity30 using data from the @entity32 , a five - year project to photograph the southern sky in extreme detail			1
the nine dwarf galaxies were spotted in the night sky in the southern hemisphere , near the large and @entity39 , which are the largest dwarf galaxies in the @entity3 's orbit			1
astronomers have discovered that a strange ring of distant stars may actually be part of our galaxy , making it 50 per cent bigger at 150,000 light - years wide			1
this is based on re-analysis of a distant ring that surrounds our galaxy , which the astronomers think is now actually part of it , and could have been disturbed by other dwarf galaxies			2
the team of scientists from @entity55 in @entity56 studied the @entity57 , which is a long ring - like filament of stars that ‘ wraps ’ around our galaxy three times			0
‘ the discovery of so many satellites in such a small area of the sky was completely unexpected , ' said dr @entity66 of @entity30 ’s @entity67 , the study ’s lead author			0
‘ i could not believe my eyes			0
’ the newly discovered objects are each a billion times dimmer than the @entity3 , and a million times less massive			1
this makes them incredibly difficult to find , even in our galactic neighbourhood			0
dwarf galaxies are the smallest galaxy structures in the universe , and can contain as few as 5,000 stars - whereas the @entity3 has around 200 billion			1
importantly , though , they are thought to contain 99 per cent dark matter and just one per cent observable matter			1
this means they should be useful to test cosmological theories of dark matter , which makes up 25 per cent of all matter in the universe but is yet to be detected			2
‘ dwarf satellites are the final frontier for testing our theories of dark matter , ’ said dr @entity86 of the @entity67 , one of the study ’s co-authors			1
‘ we need to find them to determine whether our cosmological picture makes sense			0
finding such a large group of satellites near the @entity23 was surprising , though , as earlier surveys of the southern sky found very little , so we were not expecting to stumble on such treasure			0
’ the newly discovered objects are each a billion times dimmer than the @entity3 , and a million times less @entity103 makes them incredibly difficult to find , even in our galactic neighbourhood			1
they are seen here in an artist 's impression below the plane of our galaxy ‘ dwarf satellites are the final frontier for testing our theories of dark matter , ’ said dr @entity86 of the @entity67 , one of the study ’s co-authors			2
on the left in these images is @entity117 2 , in the middle is @entity119 and on the right is @entity121 1 these dwarf galaxies are the first to be discovered after dozens were found in 2005 and 2006			1
the closest of the newly discovered dwarf galaxies is being torn apart by the @entity3 , while the most distant is about to start being pulled in towards us			1
when physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars , they are confronted with a mystery			0
if they only take visible matter into account , their equations simply do n't add up ; the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces			0
from this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light but does , as a whole , interact by means of the gravitational force			0
called ' dark matter ' , this substance appears to make up at least 25 per cent of the matter in the known universe			2
their origins remain a bit of a mystery , though ; they may have once orbited the @entity23 until they were thrown out			0
however , it should be noted that while three of the objects are definitely dwarf galaxies , some of the other six may actually be globular clusters			2
these are spherical collections of stars that are not thought to be held together by dark matter			2
another implication of the discovery is that two star - forming clusters found below the @entity3 , announced last month , may actually have an extragalactic origin			0
known as @entity176 and 439 , the two clusters were found 16,000 light - years below the flattened disk of the @entity3			1
previously , it was only thought possible for stars to form inside giant molecular clouds ( @entity181 ) located in the inner part of the galactic disc			0
the two clusters were thought to have been pushed out of the galactic disk by a ‘ superwind ’ caused by supernovae			0
but dr @entity188 of the @entity187 in @entity189 , @entity190 - who led the study - told @entity192 that the discovery by the @entity30 scientists now suggests they might have come from beyond our own galaxy before being captured			0
‘ this work supports the idea that @entity176 and @entity199 have an extragalactic origin , ’ he said			0
the @entity23 and a stream of neutral hydrogen are shown in the illustration here , along with the newly discovered dwarf galaxies			2
their origins remain a bit of a mystery , though ; they may have once orbited the @entity23 until they were thrown out			0

@entity30 astronomers have found new nine dwarf galaxies in orbit around the @entity3
they are the first to be discovered orbiting the @entity3 in a decade since dozens were found in 2005 and 2006
there are nine in total , ranging in distance from 95,000 to 1.2 million light - years
each is a billion times dimmer and a million times less massive than the @entity3 , and contain much fewer stars
but they are thought to be 99 *%* dark matter - which could help confirm theories of its presence in the cosmos
