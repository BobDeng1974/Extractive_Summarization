click here for all the stats and heat maps from the game at the @entity4 @entity5 now has one hundred caps and three goals for the @entity8			0
as @entity9 and his team edge forwards towards an unlikely shot at qualification for the @entity14 finals , that second statistic is currently somewhat more important than the first			0
only seconds remained in added time in @entity19 on tuesday night as @entity20 seemed to be heading to a rather expected and routine defeat against a @entity23 team unimpressive but still markedly superior			1
@entity5 , however , had been a @entity106 at centre - half all night and , when it mattered , he appeared just an inch or two ahead of @entity35 ’s @entity40 to prod an unlikely equaliser past @entity42 after a deep cross from substitute @entity91 had been hooked back across goal deep in the 94th minute			1
it really was a most incredible finish			0
@entity5 ’s last goal for his country had come against @entity116			2
suffice to say , this one may transpire to be much more important			0
having not lost back - to - back competitive games since the @entity14 finals hosted by @entity119 and @entity120 14 years ago , @entity35 were clearly intent making amends for their setback across the @entity124 border at the weekend			2
for much of the first half , their football was purposeful and aggressive			2
for long periods , though , there was not much to show for it once play reached the environs of the @entity32 penalty area			2
indeed , @entity32 goalkeeper @entity58 was worked only twice in an opening 45 minutes that saw @entity9 ’s team hold the @entity23 at bay with relative comfort			1
certainly @entity138 were organised and not lacking in energy themselves			0
@entity5 and @entity70 were particularly impressive immediately in front of @entity58 even if the @entity32 largely failed to hold on to the ball whenever they did manage to venture in to the @entity23 half			1
a team unrecognisable in part to the one that lifted the @entity149 in @entity150 back in early july , @entity35 nevertheless bristled with attacking menace at the outset			0
indeed , only five minutes had elapsed when left - back @entity80 advanced to smack a superb right foot volley in to the top of the crossbar from 25 yards			1
for a while this effort seemed to set the tone as the @entity23 midfield eased the @entity32 defence so far towards their own goal that , at times , as many as six green shirts retreated to form some kind of shield in front of @entity58			1
thousands of @entity32 fans travelled to watch their team pick up their seventh point in three games in @entity62 qualifying @entity32 fans were in raptures after @entity24 's equaliser , with one @entity23 ( centre ) looking particularly out of place among green shirts substitute @entity82 appeals for a penalty after @entity70 appeared to bring him down , but the referee waved play on @entity35 defender @entity78 had a free header early on but his attempt went wide of the target @entity94 goes in with a hefty challenge on @entity85 in the middle of the pitch , but no free - kick is awarded to the @entity23 one rare @entity20 attack ended with @entity188 keeper @entity42 grabbing the ball low just ahead of @entity95 there were other early chances , too , as full - back @entity78 headed a good chance wide after a training ground set piece between @entity54 and @entity77 provided him with an opportunity			1
then @entity85 made an intelligent run inside @entity89 to receive possession and pull the ball back to @entity54			1
the shot , though , was dragged wide			0
@entity32 forays in to @entity23 territory were rare but , as time passed , so were genuine threats on their goal			1
mistakes from @entity70 and then @entity58 gave @entity35 an apparent route to goal but @entity5 cleared with a huge swing of the right boot that said everything about the urgency of the situation			0
before the interval there was still time for @entity81 to head a corner over while @entity54 also whistled another long range effort over the frame of the goal			1
@entity35 , though , reached half - time with much to think about and made a change for the second period as @entity223 ’s @entity82 replaced @entity81 for the second period			2
@entity95 , who scored a hat - trick against @entity226 at the weekend , was starved of opportunities in the first half @entity90 controls the ball for @entity20 as @entity231 defender @entity40 keeps an eye on the @entity234 man @entity24 gets close to @entity235 as the @entity188 star looks to control the ball on the edge of the area @entity69 , @entity40 and @entity54 ( left ) all get stuck in after a loose ball during the @entity62 encounter nov 14 : @entity243 ( a ) mar 29 , 2015 : @entity244 ( @entity245 ) jun 13 : @entity243 ( @entity245 ) sep 4 : @entity226 ( a ) sep 7 : @entity246 ( @entity245 ) oct 8 : @entity35 ( @entity245 ) oct 11 : @entity244 ( a ) at the start of the second - half , @entity20 briefly threatened as @entity94 crossed low to the near post forcing @entity23 goalkeeper @entity42 to be sure of his handling as @entity95 looked to profit from any uncertainty six yards from goal			1
before long , however , @entity35 were back on top and @entity58 was at his best to touch over a long - range shot from @entity54 before @entity40 almost turned in the resulting corner from close range			2
just before the hour , meanwhile , came a moment of apparent controversy as @entity82 appeared to be fouled in the penalty area by @entity70 after @entity77 had superbly cushioned a header in to the substitute ’s path			0
however , replays showed that the referee was correct to wave away penalty appeals as there had been no contact and @entity82 had in fact fallen over rather easily			0
by now , with less than half an hour left , @entity20 were beginning to look rather ragged			2
they just could n’t keep the ball and , as such , were beginning to look increasingly vulnerable			0
@entity35 , though , were still looking less than convincing			0
@entity270 ( left ) gives instructions to his @entity35 side , who struggled to get going , while @entity9 ponders on the touchline @entity20 forward @entity29 attempts to control an aerial ball under pressure from @entity80 @entity54 ( 18 ) opened the scoring with a sweet strike - click here to see the best stats and heat maps from @entity19 @entity29 attempts to put @entity281 star @entity85 off as he drives forward with the ball at his home ground in @entity19 having had a more realistic penalty appeal rejected when @entity5 seemed to grapple @entity75 to the ground , @entity35 finally broke through in the 70th minute			1
@entity54 had already had a few sighters when he lined up another from 25 yards and this time his low right foot shot fizzed past @entity58 and found the corner via the foot of the goalkeeper ’s right - hand post			2
right at the death , @entity20 almost scored when @entity94 crossed low from the left for @entity91 , only for @entity80 somehow to throw himself in the way of the ball and block the threat			1
then up stepped @entity5 to write his own story			0
‘ i remember all my international goals because there are n’t many , ’ said the former @entity299 player			0
‘ this one overtakes the other two			0
i ’m not one for hanging shirts up but this one may be heading for the mantelpiece in my mum and dad ’s house			0
’ the result leaves @entity20 with seven points from three games in @entity62 , with the hardest away trip out of the way for @entity9 and assistant @entity313			1
@entity77 , who scored twice for @entity35 in the 2 - 1 win over @entity243 last month , stretches in his attempt to control the ball @entity35 's @entity83 ( right ) challenges @entity20 midfielder @entity94 during the first half in @entity19 @entity20 's @entity89 attempts to get the ball off @entity35 's @entity55 midfielder kroos in the first half @entity20 snuffed out @entity35 for the first half , with keeper @entity58 collecting a ball as @entity85 attempts to get in here @entity75 attempts to shake off @entity92 in the middle of the park as @entity20 struggled to get the ball early on a banner reading ' thanks ' is arranged on the seats inside the @entity4 , with four stars representing @entity35 's @entity149 wins @entity329 frustrated by @entity20 draw			1

@entity332 defender @entity24 popped up with a 94th - minute equaliser to grab a vital point in @entity62
@entity54 ' 70th - minute goal looked to have broken @entity32 hearts in @entity19
@entity20 were under pressure from the off , with @entity80 hitting the bar inside 10 minutes
but they held out for the first half , with the world champions having only two shots on target in the opening 45
