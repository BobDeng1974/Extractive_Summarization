@entity10 pre-empted attempts to sack him by resigning from the party – but vowed to remain in his role as an independent @entity14			2
he shrugged off any blame for the scandal , despite having been the @entity5 councillor responsible for children ’s services in @entity4 from 2005 to 2010 when the abuse of vulnerable girls by @entity23 men was at its worst			1
‘ protecting vulnerable people has been my number one priority as @entity34 for @entity35			1
‘ i have had to make the difficult decision to stand down from the @entity5 and it ’s with deep regret that i ’ve come to that decision			2
’ mr @entity10 sparked incredulity yesterday by claiming the damning report highlighting the abuse of at least 1,400 girls over 16 years came as ‘ a huge surprise ’			1
in an astonishing interview , he said : ‘ i do n’t think any of this was my direct fault			1
’ earlier , @entity5 had warned it would suspend him from the party if he had not resigned by this morning			0
mr @entity10 insisted he had taken action to prevent the sickening attacks and was ‘ proud of the progress @entity52 has made ’ – even though it has brought few abusers to justice			1
he went on to claim he had not received the three key official reports that described growing child sexual exploitation in @entity4			2
mr @entity10 shrugged off any blame for the scandal , despite having been the @entity5 councillor responsible for children 's services in the town from 2005 to 2010 when the abuse of vulnerable girls by @entity23 men was at its worst asked by @entity66 whether he had seen them , he said : ‘ it was not escalated to senior management level			1
‘ i did n’t see any of the reports in 2002 or 2003			0
the report in 2006 did n’t come to me			0
’ but the investigation into the scandal , commissioned by the council from professor @entity75 , says he received a report entitled @entity77 from sexual assault in @entity4 in june 2007			1
he also received two further reports on sexual exploitation in 2008 and a further one in 2009 , according to professor @entity75			0
she said that when he took over responsibility for the protection of vulnerable young people in 2005 , councillors and senior officials at the authority were fully aware of the sexual exploitation in the @entity89 for senior managers at the council presented the abuse ‘ in the most explicit terms ’ , professor @entity75 added			1
he claimed he had not seen the previous three official reports , published in 2002 , 2003 and 2006 , which described growing child sexual exploitation in @entity4			0
but the investigation into the scandal , commissioned by the council from professor @entity75 , says he received a report after council leader @entity101 quit on tuesday , senior labour and @entity100 politicians yesterday called on mr @entity10 to resign , too			1
a @entity5 spokesman said : ‘ the report into child abuse in @entity4 was devastating in its findings			1
‘ vulnerable children were repeatedly abused and then let down			2
in the light of this report , it is appropriate that @entity35 police and crime commissioner @entity10 should step down			1
’ shadow chancellor @entity111 , who was children ’s secretary in the last @entity5 government , admitted the party could not force mr @entity10 to quit			1
he told @entity115 ’s @entity116 : ‘ the @entity5 has no power to compel somebody who has been elected as a police and crime commissioner to stand down			1
‘ but it is absolutely our view that he should do so			0
that is something which has been communicated to him today			0
we need to show that we , not just in @entity4 but across the country , can command public confidence to keep children safe			2
‘ lessons have got to be learned			0
but when you have a failure of this magnitude and catastrophe , people have to take responsibility			0
' children as young as 11 were doused in petrol and threatened with fire and told not to speak out in the town ( pictured ) the report revealed shadow home secretary @entity141 added : ‘ we have said we think the police and crime commissioner should stand down , just as the leader of the council has done , because 1,400 children were abused and they were let down badly by the authorities			1
’ home secretary @entity148 said : ‘ @entity10 obviously has had involvement in this , both as his role as a councillor and obviously he ’s now the police and crime commissioner			1
‘ it ’s not my job as home secretary to hire and fire police and crime commissioners ... i believe he has real questions to answer and i think in the circumstances he should heed those calls			1
’ during a series of interviews with broadcasters yesterday , mr @entity10 said he quit his role on @entity166 in 2010 when the scale of sexual abuse began to emerge			1
he said there was no need for him to resign again over the same issue			0
mr @entity10 said : ‘ i take my share of the responsibility			1
there was systemic failure and i only wish that i knew more at the time			0
‘ if i knew then what i know now , then clearly more could have been done			0
i think i took appropriate actions where that was available			0
i ’m completely astonished by the scale of the issue that has been identified			0
‘ i ’m just as disgusted as any other right - thinking person in @entity4 and across the country to the scale of this problem			1
' i have sought to do everything in my power during any role that i have held , both as a council cabinet member and now as @entity191 to make that difference and to protect and safeguard more children			0
’ mr @entity10 , who lives in @entity4 , wrote about himself on his website : ‘ people who know me describe me as a man of integrity with a strong track record in championing ordinary people			1
’ he also promised to ‘ protect the most vulnerable in our society ’			2
@entity202 said he did not look further into the town 's child abuse sex scandal because he is a ' true @entity205 reader and liberal leftie ' and ' did not want to rock the multi-cultural boat ' political correctness stopped left - wing politicians and council officials from doing more to expose the abuse scandal , @entity4 ’s former mp said yesterday			1
@entity202 accepted he should have done more but said his own ‘ liberal leftie ’ background made him reluctant to speak out over abuse allegations against @entity217 men			1
the shamed former @entity5 politician , who was jailed over the expenses scandal and is no longer a member of the party , said : ‘ i should have burrowed into this			0
perhaps , yes , as a true @entity205 reader and a liberal leftie i suppose , i did n’t want to raise that too hard			0
’ mr @entity202 blamed a ‘ culture of not wanting to rock the multi-cultural unity boat ’ for the failure by numerous agencies and individuals to expose the child exploitation			2
he has previously admitted that he , like other politicians , had feared losing @entity217 votes if he aired ‘ the dirty secrets about bad practices in the @entity236 ’			0
the damning report into the scandal said council staff feared they would be branded racist if they discussed the allegations with the @entity244 community – even though the victims had described the majority of the men involved as @entity23			2
culture secretary @entity248 , the son of @entity244 immigrants , yesterday said it could ‘ definitely not ’ have been considered racist to investigate the abuse			2
@entity252 , founder of @entity253 , told the @entity115 the ethnicity of the majority of the abusers did not mean the scandal should have been kept quiet			0
@entity258 @entity257 said she considered it racist for the issue not to have been raised within the community			0
she told @entity115 ’s @entity116 : ‘ it ’s actually racist for anybody to consider that – were you to approach that community – it would n’t take seriously what you were raising			2
’ mr @entity202 , who was jailed for six months after he admitted submitting fake invoices in his expenses , told @entity116 the abuse was never raised with him personally in his 18 years as @entity4 mp from 1994 to 2012			1
he admitted he was aware of the allegations from press reports			0
in his book @entity272 , published earlier this year after his release from @entity274 , mr @entity202 said he was one of many politicians who chose not to speak out about ‘ dirty secrets ’ because of the fear of losing @entity217 votes			2
he wrote : ‘ i feel ashamed that i too , like so many mps , preferred to keep silent on some of the dirty secrets about bad practices in the @entity236			0
’ claims were made last night that some @entity5 councillors may have turned a blind eye to child sex abuse because they needed the @entity23 vote			2
former labour sources described a culture where councillors acted as ‘ mafia bosses ’ and told their constituents that they could ‘ do anything for them ’ to keep them on side			0
they told the @entity1 : ‘ @entity166 is horrendously corrupt			0
there is a large @entity23 contingency and a strong @entity5 vote among the ethnic community so they may have turned a blind eye to things to keep their votes			0
