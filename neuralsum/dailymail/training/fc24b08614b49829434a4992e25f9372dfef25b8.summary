a woman who had lap band surgery six years ago is warning people against having the procedure , despite losing 32 kilograms in 12 months			1
@entity4 , from @entity5 , thought she had finally found the solution to all her weight issues when she had the surgery in 2008			1
but now ms @entity4 wishes she never had the lap band done in the first place			1
@entity26 surgery professor @entity25 and senior lecturer of surgery at @entity30 dr @entity29 penned an editorial in the @entity32 arguing for the move			2
professor @entity25 and dr @entity29 wrote there was ' solid evidence that the expense of surgery will be offset by reduced costs of managing comorbid conditions , yielding improved quality and length of life , as well as by reduced costs of medication and food '			2
the professor told @entity46 on monday morning there were people who were ' sick with obesity '			2
ms @entity4 ( pictured with her husband , @entity50 , two months before her surgery in 2009 , weighing about 118 kilograms the now 49 - year - old is pictured here in her belly dancing outfit in 2011 , weighing about 90 kilograms ' they 're diabetic , they 're suffering from kidney ailments , from eye disease , from nerve complaints related to their diabetes , and their lives will be shortened if they do n't have something done			1
' in these situations , surgery offers something that is truly life - prolonging			2
' but @entity4 , 49 , said it was ' really scary ' to hear the surgeons were keen on the idea to introduce weight loss surgeries to the public health system			2
ms @entity4 said the surgery was having the desired effect for the first 12 months after she had it done			1
she withdrew $ 15,000 from her super to fund the procedure which would make it possible for her to have a knee surgery which her specialist would only do if she lost some weight			2
at the time , ms @entity4 was 121 kilograms			1
' i 've been a big girl since i was 16 and my knee basically said " i 'm not carting you around ... anymore " and they gave up , ' she told @entity84			0
' i went to see a specialist and he said i needed a knee replacement			0
' he told me i needed to lose 60 kilograms before he would do the surgery			2
' ms @entity4 and her husband on their wedding day in october 2009 when she weighed 81 kilograms she said she would never have the surgery again because of the ongoing health issues she has had because of the procedure ( pictured here in 2012 ) when she finally had the weight loss surgery , ms @entity4 was 116 kilograms and within a year she weighed 80 kilograms			1
but soon the @entity5 woman ran into trouble			1
when the time came to tighten the band around the top of her stomach for the first time , surgeons had trouble finding the port which helped filter the saline solution into the chord that restricts the portion of food being consumed			2
it was discovered the port had been placed in the wrong place and could not be reached without causing ms @entity4 extreme pain and discomfort			1
later on , it also emerged the saline solution had been leaking into her body and causing her to get sick			2
' i would get these purple and black bruises after fills which were probably eight to nine centimetres across and probably the same width			0
they were just horrid , ' she said			0
ms @entity4 said she also had been in out of hospital with diverticulitis - a digestive illness that inflames the inside of the bowel walls - and suffered more regularly from migraines			1
' you ’re pretty much an open book to infections and my white cell count was down , ' she said			0
' i ’d rather be fat and happy rather than go through that again			0
' despite dropping the pounds quickly by august 2009 ( right ) , ms @entity4 has since put the weight back on ( left in 2013 ) her warning against the surgery comes as two @entity22 doctors call for weight loss surgeries to be more accessible through the public health system but it was not just the hospital trips that has put ms @entity4 off the idea of weight loss surgeries			1
she has to exercise extreme discipline when eating , making sure she takes small sips and bites or she risks the chance of throwing up her food			0
' when you eat too much of it , you vomit			0
there 's no warning whatsoever , ' ms @entity4 said			1
' to sit down with friends at a cafe , it would take 45 minutes for me to finish a cup of coffee whereas it would take my friends 10 minutes			0
' it would be pretty embarrassing to throw it back up			0
' it has cost me a lot in handbags , as my husband would say , because i would vomit up in handbags			0
' ms @entity4 said if she could go back in time she would not have opted for the surgery and she was not alone in her suffering			1
' there are not many who have been having a good time with this thing [ lap band surgery ] , ' ms @entity4 said			1
' the awareness of the failure rate of these things needs to be known			0
it 's not the greatest thing ever to do			0
' people will go into this and think it 's a miracle cure but it 's not			0
' ms @entity4 said supportive friends and family had really helped her through the difficult time			1
she is more hopeful for the future , having had a full replacement on october 14			0
' three weeks ago i wanted it removed			0
i ca n't cope with being sick all the time but i spoke to a really good surgeon and he said to me i would really like you to give it one more go , ' ms @entity4 said			1
' but if anything else happens , i 'm getting it removed ... i 'm never having weight loss surgery again			0
