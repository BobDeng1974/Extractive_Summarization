taking statins can increase your chance of developing diabetes by up to 46 per cent , research has shown taking statins can increase your chance of developing diabetes by up to 46 per cent , research has shown			0
the cholesterol - lowering drugs are thought to prevent the hormone insulin from working properly , which can trigger type 2 diabetes			1
the risk , which is far higher than previously believed , has prompted fresh concern about the side effects of the pills			1
the findings are particularly worrying as last year the @entity15 recommended that up to 17million adults should be on statins to prevent heart attacks and strokes			1
the drugs ’ rationing body @entity21 published guidance last july urging @entity24 to prescribe them to anyone with a 10 per cent risk of developing heart disease in a decade			0
this represents around 40 per cent of adults in the @entity30 , and academics said the advice was ‘ foolhardy ’ when so little was known about the side effects			1
in the latest study , scientists from the @entity35 studied 8,749 men aged 45 to 73 over a six - year period			1
just under a quarter were taking statins when the study started			0
some had only been on the pills for a few months , others for several years			0
over the course of the study , the scientists found that taking statins increased the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 46 per cent			0
their research , published in the journal @entity50 , found that statins reduced the ability of insulin to break down blood sugar			0
this is known as insulin sensitivity , and was on average 24.3 per cent lower in men who were taking statins			2
the cholesterol - lowering drugs are thought to prevent the hormone insulin from working properly , which can trigger type 2 diabetes the researchers believe that if insulin does not break down blood sugar , and the body ’s sugar levels rise too high , then it can trigger type 2 diabetes			1
they concluded : ‘ statin therapy was associated with a 46 per cent increased risk of type 2 diabetes			0
' the association of statin use with increased risk of developing diabetes is most likely directly related to statins decreasing both insulin sensitivity and secretion			2
’ dr @entity79 , a consultant cardiologist in @entity80 , said that contrary to the @entity15 guidance , healthy adults should not be taking statins , adding : ‘ i personally would n’t take it or recommend it to friend or family member who is otherwise healthy but let them make up their own minds after giving them all the information			2
