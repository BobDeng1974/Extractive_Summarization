@entity0 from @entity1 ! the beautiful little island paradise in the @entity3 is just 50 minutes by propeller plane from @entity5 ( but more of that later )			1
you 'll have to forgive the late blog entry this week as high levels of partying and industrial strength hangovers have taken their toll			0
@entity14 was a big one that lasted well into jan 1 - a beach party with the world 's biggest dj @entity17			1
the flight into @entity1 is not for the faint - hearted and so the luxury of private jet does help , says @entity22 my good friend @entity23 and i had vip tickets to the @entity26 , which was mind - blowing			1
right from the start we knew it was going to be one of those memorable nights that we 'll talk about for years to come			0
we started with a few @entity35 @entity34 cocktails ( jalapeno - infused tequila gives this drink a bit of a kick ) at the @entity40 bar at my parent 's hotel the @entity43 , before moving over to @entity45 beach by about 11pm so that we could have a good spot when midnight came in			1
@entity45 beach is next door to our hotel on @entity49 so it 's literally two minutes walk away across the sand			2
the party was heaving with the great and the good , and it was a very beautiful crowd			0
we had a table right next to the @entity17 – you can see how close we were from the picture			1
and if you felt like a bit of time out , you could just walk down to the sea and have a paddle			0
it was an amazing night that went on to a friend 's poolside party at the villa up in the hills just above			1
the next day was spent recovering at the @entity69 at the @entity70			0
you can see the pictures we took – they 're not the best shots ever but it was the best we could do in our state of health			0
@entity22 had a table right next to the @entity17 - @entity17 - you can see how close they were from this picture @entity22 and his good friend @entity23 had vip tickets to the @entity26 , which was ' mind - blowing ' if you felt like a bit of time - out from the party , you could just walk down to the sea and have a paddle i flew out to @entity1 's just after @entity88 with my family up at our house in @entity92 , and i was lucky to get a lift on a friend 's private plane on the last leg of the journey			1
doing the flight in on a propeller plane can be a bit of a white - knuckle ride for some as incoming flights drop steeply over the top of a mountain and onto the runway			2
it 's not for the faint - hearted , so the luxury of private jet does help to calm the nerves			1
i 've done it so many times now that it does n't bother me , but it can seriously freak out nervous flyers			0
it 's a lot easier on the return journey as you take off straight over the sea , the only problem with the away leg is that you are leaving this amazing place			2
the worst part of the return flight , @entity22 says , is that you 're leaving this incredible place and now , sadly , it 's time to pack and go back to work in storm swept @entity127 … but that said , i 'm looking forward to new challenges in 2014			2
not to go back to yo - yo dieting			1
i 've been a good boy so far and i 'm still in good shape			2
i 've kept up my fitness and thanks to the odd @entity135 pill here and there i 've kept the snacking at bay			0
i want to look my best for the next series of made in @entity142			1
we start filming in a couple of weeks and it will be great to hook up with everyone again after a long break			0
to stay young , free and single			2
ok , this one might be harder to keep but so far , one week in and i 'm doing fine			0
see you all soon , @entity149 @entity22 and his friend spent the next day recovering at the @entity69 in the @entity43 hotel			0

@entity142 's @entity153 has an *unforgettable* night in @entity1
had table right near dj @entity17 on @entity14
*resolutions* *include* to stay in shape - no more yo - yo dieting
