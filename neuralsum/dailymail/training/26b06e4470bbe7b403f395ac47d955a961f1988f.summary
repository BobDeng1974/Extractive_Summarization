grandmother @entity0 , 75 , pictured with @entity1 , was investigated by police for ' stealing ' her own cat when grandmother @entity0 found her missing tomcat after four traumatic months of searching , she was overjoyed			1
but she could never have known that the return of @entity1 would spark a police probe , a bitter custody battle , a mischievous poster campaign and an mp ’s intervention – all over the pet that was rightfully hers			1
widow mrs @entity0 , 75 , had owned the two - year - old black cat since he was just five weeks old , and she was heartbroken when he disappeared in february			1
but just four months later , he suddenly appeared at her bungalow in @entity15			0
‘ it was ironic , because i thought i ’d never see @entity1 again [ and ] i ’d just been approved by an animal shelter to have another cat when he came back , ’ she said			1
‘ when the lady from the shelter said we should see if @entity1 had been living with someone else i thought nothing of it			2
he was in excellent condition and had clearly been looked after by someone			0
’ a check revealed @entity1 had been microchipped by a new owner , who had renamed him @entity29 after finding him at @entity31 centre			2
but he did n’t get on with her other cat , and she did n’t want him back			0
relieved , mrs @entity0 thought that was the end of the matter			2
but a week later she received a call from the police , who told her she was being investigated for the theft of @entity1			1
‘ at the same time , “ @entity41 ” posters [ were put up ] around the area with photos of @entity1 on them claiming he ’d been stolen , ’ she said			2
‘ they said he was being “ held by a woman in @entity51 ” , the area of @entity15 where i live , and they even offered £ 100 for his safe return			0
’ over the next three weeks , three police officers were dispatched to investigate the custody case surrounding @entity1 , and mrs @entity0 claims they contacted her ‘ countless times ’			1
@entity1 was adopted by new owners , who renamed him @entity29 and microchipped , after he went missing for four months the dispute began when @entity1 ’s new owner – the one listed on his microchip – decided she did want him back after all			1
mrs @entity0 said : ‘ naturally i was extremely upset as @entity1 is happy living with me			1
’ distressed at the posters , which featured @entity31 ’s name on the top , mrs @entity0 hired a solicitor to write to the shelter and ask for their removal			2
she also complained to @entity67 and @entity70 ’s police and crime commissioner , @entity68			0
she said : ‘ a few years ago i had a burglary on my home ... but the police did n’t even bother to attend			0
‘ i said investigating me for the theft of my own cat was a waste of time and money			0
’ in desperation , mrs @entity0 even asked @entity15 ’s @entity80 mp @entity79 to intervene			0
mrs @entity79 said : ‘ this has been a distressing case for all concerned			0
but i am satisfied the police have taken this case seriously ... and that @entity1 is happily living with his rightful owner			1
’ but mrs @entity0 said she is still terrified to let @entity1 out of the house , in case she loses him again			1
no one at @entity31 was available to comment .			0
