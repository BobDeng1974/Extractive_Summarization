a businessman who built his own £ 325,000 toll road to bypass roadworks is to close the shortcut after the local council invested £ 660,000 to finish repairs five weeks early			1
@entity6 , 63 , claims he will now not make a penny and will lose out on a profit of several thousand pounds after @entity9 and @entity10 completed the work ahead of schedule			1
he became the first private individual to build a @entity15 toll road in more than a century when a crucial road in @entity17 , @entity10 , was closed by a landslip , leaving locals with a 14 - mile diversion			1
@entity6 , 63 , who built his own £ 325,000 toll road to bypass roadworks is to close the shortcut the roadworks were scheduled to last until @entity24 , which would have given mr @entity6 and his wife @entity25 , 52 , a healthy profit on their £ 325,000 investment			1
but instead the @entity29 between @entity30 and @entity9 will re-open tomorrow , meaning he couple will just break even after spending £ 150,000 to build the road and £ 150,000 on upkeep			1
mr @entity6 said he has received constant opposition from the local authority , which bombarded him with red tape and forced him to spend £ 25,000 gaining retrospective planning permission			1
he also revealed that officials at @entity9 had sent him a £ 3,500 bill for business rates despite the toll road not being official			1
' it feels like they may have raised the money to take me out of the equation			0
the businessman claims he will now not make a penny and will lose out on a profit of several thousand pounds after @entity52 council suddenly found extra money to repair roadworks ' it 's quite astonishing that they found this extra cash in september			1
it 's sped up the process to get the road open early			2
' it 's a catch 22 , i want the road back open but we had budgeted for the road to be closed till @entity24			0
' now myself and the farmer who let me use his land probably wo n't see a penny			2
' i 'm disappointed in the overall support from the council			0
if they had supported me things would have been so much better			0
' people would have gotten everywhere quicker and the farmer and i would have made some money			0
' his wife @entity25 , 52 , accused @entity9 of deliberately trying to bankrupt them			1
she said : ' the @entity77 is and always was a community initiative to help with the dreadful situation we found ourselves in			0
' we thought , stupidly with hindsight , that the council would be supportive			0
after all , we did n't want them to cough up any dosh for it - we wanted it to pay for itself			2
the roadworks were scheduled to last until @entity24 , which would have given mr @entity6 and his wife @entity25 , 52 , a healthy profit on their £ 325,000 investment ' we have used our home as a guarantee for the costs of the temporary road , which was a decision we came to with our eyes wide open			1
' the @entity29 was closed in february after a landslip caused huge cracks to appear in the road			1
so the couple asked their friend @entity103 if they could rent the field until @entity24 and hired three workmen to help build the road in just ten days			0
the toll road needed to take over 150,000 paying customers to move into profit , which the couple thought was easily possible by @entity24			2
more than 25,000 cars passed through its toll booths in the first month			0
he charged motorists £ 2 per journey to use the 365 metres long and seven metres wide bypass made from rolled chippings			0
but in september the council suddenly found a further £ 660,000 to complete the roadworks early and open the main road , meaning the toll road will be shut			1
mr @entity6 has been hailed a hero for his entrepreneurial spirit and said the public have really taken the toll road into their hearts			1
' people are coming over the road with beaming faces and i have had letters of support from all over the country , ' he said			0
but instead the @entity29 between @entity30 and @entity9 will re-open tomorrow , meaning he couple will just break even after spending £ 150,000 to build the road and £ 150,000 on upkeep he charged motorists £ 2 per journey to use the 365 metres long and seven metres wide bypass made from rolled chippings ' well , i say all over the country , but it is actually all over the world , from @entity148 and @entity149 , it has just really captured people 's imaginations			1
' but his wife said the whole experience has been a ' nightmare ' because of the ' obstructive ' behaviour of the council			2
' my husband and i have done lots of interesting things in our working lives , but i have to say that the @entity77 experience has been the single most stressful project we have ever been involved in , ' said mrs @entity167			0
' @entity168 has received a bill from the @entity52 council for business rates to the tune of £ 3,500 and yet they do not recognise the temporary toll road as a community initiative			1
' i just can not believe how blatantly obstructive the council has been during this whole saga			0
they have done everything they can to hinder us			0
' @entity9 denies trying to block the couple , saying the extra cash was necessary to speed up the works			2
it said in a statement : ' the council has made a considerable effort to work with mr @entity6 and various officers and members have met with him several times			2
' @entity192 has provided expertise , advice and our ground investigation results free of charge			0
' this road is open to the public and therefore , in the public interest , must comply with the normal safety standards for public roads			0
' councillors made an emergency decision to approve an extra £ 660,000 ( for the @entity206 repairs ) following further investigation works at the site , which discovered that below the land which had already moved , there was another layer of ' soft ' rock , which was also at risk of sliding			2
' the additional funding was needed for the necessary revised scheme which required two rows of deep piling to ensure that future land - slips are prevented			0
' the @entity29 was closed in february after a landslip caused huge cracks to appear in the road			1
