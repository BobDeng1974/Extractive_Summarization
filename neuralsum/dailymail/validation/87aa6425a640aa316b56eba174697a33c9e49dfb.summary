anyone who has ever tried to bathe an animal , especially a big one , will probably tell you that it can be a real struggle			0
but this little elephant in @entity6 proves that it ’s not always as hard as you would think			1
in fact , it ’s actually quite fun			0
captured on video by a visiting tourist who dubbed the elephant @entity14 , the excitable animal is filmed diving straight towards the bath , snagging its leg on the side of it , tripping up and falling straight into the water			1
after balancing on its head for a while looking as if it is struggling , the elephant manages to turn itself back onto its side and begins splashing about - seemingly unbothered by its less - than - graceful entry into the water			1
returning to its feet , the elephant heads towards the man bathing it , who is believed to be @entity30 , the @entity31 tourist who later uploaded the footage from the @entity33 and @entity34 , in @entity6			1
but the excitement is n't over for the young elephant			2
it proceeds to jumping back out of the bath and attempt to steal the hose , causing the surrounding visitors to laugh hysterically			2
the excited elephant charges straight towards the bath and snags its leg off of it on the way in causing it to fall over the calf slip - slided its way in eventually as grown elephants stood in the back watching head over heels ! the elephant looks like it is about to drown before it turns itself onto its side and begins splashing the video concludes with @entity14 jumping back into the bath even more enthusiastically , before a woman and little girl spray it with a hose			1
after an enjoyable roll around in the water , apparently delighting in its added shower , the elephant grabs the hose from the girl and her mother and runs away with it in its trunk			2
royal @entity70 in @entity72 is a non-profit organisation that breeds elephants , cares for retired elephants and looks after all the ones in between			1
the little guy just could n't get enough of the spray after rolling about in the water , the elephant jumps up and attempts to steal the hose from the man their popular @entity85 programme allows visitors to care for the animals and guides are on hand to instruct on the best ways to feed , wash and interact with them			0
