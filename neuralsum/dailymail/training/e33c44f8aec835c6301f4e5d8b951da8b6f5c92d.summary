by @entity0 published : 15:07 est , 20 august 2012 updated : 01:32 est , 21 august 2012 @entity1 was handed a suspended death sentence yesterday for murdering @entity4 businessman @entity3			1
however , in a bizarre twist , there was fevered speculation that it was n’t her in the dock			0
@entity10 was yesterday abuzz with the suggestion that the politician ’s wife employed a ‘ lookalike ’ to take her place in court			1
scroll down to watch the sentencing doppelganger ? @entity1 facing the court during her sentencing yesterday , left , and right , pictured in 2007 @entity1 looked plumper than before – in contrast to most @entity10 prisoners who lose weight in jail – and experts claimed the woman who appeared for sentencing could not be the real accused			1
two security experts ‘ familiar with facial recognition software ’ said that the person shown in state television footage of the courtroom was not @entity1			1
pictures showed her wearing a white shirt and black suit in the dock , where she stood calmly and praised the guilty verdict against her			0
‘ i feel the verdict is just and fully reflects the court ’s special respect for the law , its special respect for reality and , in particular , its special respect for life , ’ she said			0
she apologised for the ‘ great losses to the [ communist ] party and the country , for which i ought to shoulder the responsibility ’ and described the case as a ‘ huge stone weighing on me for more than half a year ’			0
@entity10 state security yesterday blocked the term ‘ body double ’ being searched after the suggestion spread like wildfire on the internet			2
though it may seem far - fetched , the use of a body double by the rich and powerful in @entity10 to take their place in courtrooms has been well documented			1
facing trial : @entity1 , 52 , and aide @entity66 , 33 , are escorted into the @entity67 no contest : during the trial @entity1 and @entity66 did not raise any objections that on november 13 , 2011 , they went to @entity3 's hotel room and , after getting him drunk , administered a fatal poison the court room in @entity78 , @entity76 province was packed with people listening to hear the fate of the murderer			1
she avoided the death penalty if true , the real @entity1 , 53 , could have done a deal with @entity85 chiefs and be spending her time under house arrest in far more comfortable surroundings than a jail			2
@entity1 ’s execution was suspended for two years , meaning that unless she commits any further offence she will be spared the bullet			2
she – or her double – faces a life sentence , which in reality is about 14 years , with some experts predicting the sentence could eventually be reduced even further with behind - the - scenes deals			0
@entity1 was convicted of murdering @entity97 mr @entity3 with cyanide after luring him to a hotel room in @entity100 , southwestern @entity10 , last november			1
foreign media were barred from the court			2
afterwards , a court spokesman said that @entity1 ’s sentence had been reduced because the judges believed mr @entity3 had ‘ used threatening words ’			1
a police officer stands guard outside @entity109 today			0
tv cameras were set up outside awaiting the sentencing of @entity1 keeping watch : in heightened security conditions , to police officers stand behind tape in bushes close to the court ready to pounce at the first sign of trouble the court also found @entity1 ’s actions reflected a ‘ psychological impairment ’ but did not elaborate			1
during @entity1 ’s one - day trial two weeks ago , the court was told mr @entity3 allegedly threatened to ‘ destroy ’ her @entity4 - educated playboy son , @entity125 , 24 , unless he was paid £ 13million			1
under threat : an undated photo of businessman @entity3 who was murdered in november last year the sum was supposedly a 10 per cent commission on a vaguely described £ 130million property deal that went sour between mr @entity3 and mr @entity125 , whom he had once mentored to win a place at @entity135			0
@entity1 is the wife of @entity136 , a rising @entity85 star tipped to rule @entity10 until his wife was accused of murder			1
he is now under house arrest while his fate is decided			0
@entity10 propagandists say @entity1 had a ‘ wolfish appetite for sex ’ and that @entity142 pressed mr @entity3 to seduce her to prise communist secrets from her			1
friends of mr @entity3 , a 41 - year - old who lived in @entity147 with his wife @entity148 and their two young children , describe the claims he had an affair with @entity1 as preposterous			2
micro-bloggers believe the government used a stand - in for @entity1 at the trial because her appearance has changed so radically since she has been in custody			2
some are blaming her puffy appearance on the medication used to treat her ‘ mental state ’ , though few are convinced			0
in 2009 , a @entity10 hospital president who caused a deadly traffic accident hired an employee ’s father to ‘ confess ’ and serve as his stand - in			0
in another case , after hitting and killing a motorcyclist , a man driving without a licence hired a substitute for £ 5,000			0
the practice is so common that there is even a term for it – ding zui			0
@entity178 means ‘ substitute ’ and zui means ‘ crime ’ , in other words , ‘ substitute criminal ’			0
political scandal : @entity185 , left , with her husband - former @entity186 secretary @entity136			0
the murder case is one of @entity10 's biggest political scandals video : @entity1 's reaction to the suspended death sentence aired on @entity10 state tv video : @entity1 escapes the death penalty for murdering @entity3 ...			1

experts claims the plumper woman who appeared at court could not be @entity1
suggestions that the convicted murderer paid someone else to take her place
