by @entity0 a new study has revealed the surprising truths behind the primary concerns of newly pregnant women in 20 different countries around the world , based on their most common @entity8 searches			2
the first things women in the @entity10 want to know when they fall pregnant are ‘ how to prevent stretch marks ' and ‘ how to lose weight ' , according to the data			1
the study , compiled by @entity8 data scientist @entity15 for the @entity17 , found that while @entity19 and @entity20 women have the exact some body priorities as @entity10 , the most common search for expectant mothers in @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 is ' how to have sex			1
' first concerns : new @entity8 data has revealed that the most common search made by newly pregnant women in the @entity10 is ' how to lose weight and prevent stretch marks ' , but for @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 , it 's ' how to have sex ' the top five concerns , in order of popularity for women in the @entity10 according to the data are : ' prevent stretch marks , lose weight , have sex , avoid stretch marks and stay fit			1
' this order was very similar in @entity42 and @entity20			0
absent from these top five concerns , but cropping up in other countries are ' take care ' in @entity25 , ' stay healthy ' in @entity26 , and ' stop vomiting ' in @entity24			1
@entity8 's data unearthed a treasure trove of further facts about how various cultures around the world shape women 's priorities so differently , while in some cases , culture seems irrelevant			2
all women tend to crave the same things for example , regardless of where they live			0
in the @entity10 the top search is ' craving ice ' , followed by salt , sweets , fruit and then spicy food			2
this is almost exactly the same in all the countries addressed			0
career boost : the @entity10 fixation on snapping back into shape after giving birth is reflected in stars like @entity72 ( left ) and @entity73 ( right ) who both publicly promoted their post-baby diets as for the @entity8 search : ' can pregnant women ... ? ' it 's food and drink related questions which top almost every list			1
but the food types vary			0
@entity10 and @entity42 women query the safety of shrimp and prawns , @entity20 wonder whether they can eat ' cream cheese ' , @entity25 search ' pizza ' , @entity88 search ' green tea ' , @entity90 search ' coffee ' and oddly , @entity26 search ' cold water			1
' other queries that crop up across the board , are from women wondering if they can fly , take pain relief , and drink alcohol			0
@entity99 women stick out tremendously , seemingly unconcerned by what they should be consuming , and search only for whether they can dye their hair , ride a bike and fly			1
and the fifth most common search in @entity90 is whether pregnant women can wear heels			0
surprisingly , in every country examined , the most common dream people @entity8 is overwhelmingly : ' i dreamed i was pregnant ' , after ' having babies , cheating on a partner , killing someone , dying , and winning the lottery '			0
which appears to neatly summarize the whole of humankind and what we 're thinking about while we spend nearly half our lives asleep			0
and surely the most depressing conclusion the study arrived at - for @entity10 women at least - are the top searches made by men soon after they find out their wives are pregnant			2
in @entity90 , it 's ' words of love ' and ' poems for my pregnant wife '			0
in the @entity10 , it 's : ' my wife is pregnant what do i do ' and ' my wife is pregnant now what '			2
@entity10 prevent stretch marks lose weight have sex avoid stretch marks stay fit @entity42 lose weight prevent stretch marks avoid stretch marks sleep have sex @entity20 prevent stretch marks lose weight avoid stretch marks sleep have sex @entity24 have sex lose weight prevent stretch marks sleep stop vomiting @entity25 sleep do sex have sex sex take care @entity26 have sex lose weight prevent stretch marks sleep stop vomiting			1

for expectant mothers in the @entity10 , how to lose weight and avoid stretch marks are the most common searches
for @entity24 , @entity26 and @entity25 , it 's how to have sex
women worldwide worry about food and cravings , but @entity99 are more concerned with whether they can dye their hair
