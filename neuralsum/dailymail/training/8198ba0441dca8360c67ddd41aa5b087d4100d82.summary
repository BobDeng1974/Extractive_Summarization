by @entity0 published : 05:33 est , 17 may 2012 updated : 10:23 est , 17 may 2012 this chilling picture shows an arsonist hiding behind a @entity4 mask moments after he set an elderly couple 's cottage ablaze as they slept inside			1
he was captured on @entity8 fleeing the scene after he shoved a home - made fire bomb through the letterbox of pensioners @entity14 and @entity15 at their home in the village of @entity18 , @entity19			1
the frail pair , aged 83 and 75 respectively , were forced to scramble from an upstairs window with the help of neighbours as flames engulfed their picturesque 17th century home			1
chilling : this @entity8 grab , released to the @entity27 by police , shows the horror mask which the arsonist hid behind after he firebombed the home of pensioners @entity15 and @entity33 in the dead of night they only survived thanks to their beloved greyhound @entity37 , who woke them by barking as the blaze took hold			1
the noise also alerted neighbours who brought a ladder from their garage , enabling the @entity46 to climb to safety			0
sadly , @entity37 was recovering from an operation and would not climb the stairs			0
he died in the fire , which destroyed the roof of the £ 400,000 , five - bedroom detached stone cottage			2
police have released the picture as they this week issued a fresh appeal for information that could help track down the culprit behind the cold - blooded attack			1
incredibly it was the fourth time the @entity46 ' home had been targeted by arsonists in a matter of months			1
gutted : flames destroyed the roof of the @entity46 ' £ 400,000 , five - bedroom detached stone cottage			2
their beloved greyhound , @entity37 , who raised the alarm , tragically died in the inferno the couple ’s home was first attacked in august and october 2010 and again in march and may last year			1
each arson attack involved a thug hurling crude petrol bombs using fireworks in glass bottles			0
the first three firebombs failed to ignite properly , but on the fourth occasion the couple woke to find their stone cottage filled with smoke			2
in a frantic 999 call , a terrified mr @entity33 told the operator : ' we ’re on fire , the house in on fire and there is smoke everywhere			0
' i ’m inside and i ’m not sure how we can get out			0
' murky : another @entity8 image captured near the @entity46 ' home shows the arsonist fleeing the scene by bicycle ' like a storyline from @entity98 ' : police still have no clue why the arsonist , or arsonists , targeted the @entity46 following the attack on may 4 last year the couple reluctantly moved after police warned them against returning to their home of 30 years			1
at the time , the crimes were described as like a ‘ story line from @entity98 ’ with detectives baffled as to why the couple had been repeatedly targeted			1
but despite the repeated fire bomb attacks , the defiant pensioners have now decided to return to the house - even though the arsonist is still at large			2
yesterday , @entity33 and mrs @entity15 said the decision to move back to their home was a difficult one to make			1
' we have two daughters living in @entity122 so we went and stayed with them , ' mr @entity33 said			0
' it was nice to be near them and also the grandchildren and it stopped us thinking about the fire			0
' my wife has been very strong			0
what she said to me , quite sensibly , was we have got to try it ( move back home )			1
' at three o’clock in the afternoon it ’s fine , it ’s at three o’clock in the morning that it ’s not so good			0
' but you have to live with it , do n’t you ? ' it ’s our home			2
it ’s the small things you miss , like memories and photographs			0
losing those is upsetting because they ’re irreplaceable			0
' mrs @entity15 , a housewife , added : ' we ’re ok in the day time , i ’m not very good at the night			2
people said they could never come back like we did , but our life is here			2
' as @entity150 launched their fresh appeal for information , detective sergeant @entity153 , who is leading the investigation , said : ' this was an extremely traumatic experience for the couple and they could easily have been killed in their own home			1
' it is important that people visit our website to look at the cctv images of the suspect that we have already released			0
' if anyone knows the man on the bike , wearing a @entity4 - style mask , then please get in touch with us as soon as possible			0
