by @entity0 published : 13:35 est , 31 may 2012 updated : 13:36 est , 31 may 2012 the drunk captain of a ship which collided with a passenger ferry in @entity4 , causing more than £ 1million of damage , has been jailed for a year			1
@entity7 , 55 , admitted crashing his cargo boat while three times over the alcohol limit but said it was because of worries over his wife ’s ill - health , his defence barrister had told @entity15			1
the married father - of - two was at the helm on march 7 when he crashed into a ferry with 100 passengers and crew on board in @entity22 after ignoring warnings from coastguards			2
@entity7 arriving at @entity26 courthouse this morning before he was sentenced to one year in jail @entity7 had no look - out despite the darkness			1
judge @entity30 told @entity7 : ' this sentence is to make it clear that the following of the regulations in relation to alcohol and also in relation to the charting and proper adherence to accepted routes is of vital importance			1
' the ending of your 30 - year career and the sentence effectively demonstrate that			0
' the defendant dropped his head as sentence was passed			0
@entity7 ’s defence barrister , @entity50 , said the captain had been drinking six or seven bottles of beer in his cabin , which was out of character for him			1
the badly - damaged remnants of @entity7 's cargo ship @entity58 , moored in @entity22 , after it was in a collision with a @entity62 ferry			1
it had followed a ' difficult ' conversation with his wife in @entity66 when he learned that her health condition had relapsed after she had previously thought she was getting better			2
the collision happened as his boat , the @entity70 , was leaving @entity22			1
the judge said the course was clear that the @entity70 should veer away by about 20 degrees but it did not			0
this caused concern at @entity22 harbour control , which reminded @entity7 of the route and alerted the master of the @entity78 , the boat he ultimately crashed into			1
about six minutes before the collision , the @entity80 attempted a manoeuvre which was designed to reduce the impact but it was too late to prevent a full - on collision , and the prow of the @entity70 struck the car deck of the @entity80			0
@entity7 's barrister said the heavy drinking that led to the crash had been ' uncharacteristic ' the judge said : ' if the route that should have been followed had been followed by the @entity70 this collision would not have occurred			1
' the collision occurred because the proper course was not followed and the responsibility was entirely that of captain @entity7			2
' there was no injury or loss of life and the @entity101 was quiet at the time of the crash			0
the court heard that the @entity105 and @entity106 had brought its own charges against the @entity108			0
they included failing to keep a proper look - out , failing to navigate , and causing serious damage to his own ship as well as another vessel			0
he pleaded guilty to those charges , but denied that he failed to follow the safety rules of his former employers , along with proper watch - keeping arrangements			0
the latter two charges will remain ' on the books ' and will not be proceeded with			0
captain @entity122 , enforcement officer with the @entity123 , said today ’s case sent out a message to other users of the sea : ' it is essential that mariners recognise that there is no place for taking alcohol when you are operating a ship at any level			2
' when you are navigating during the hours of darkness it is imperative that you have a look - out there and you are not alone			0
