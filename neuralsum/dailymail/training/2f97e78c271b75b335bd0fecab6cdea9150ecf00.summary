@entity0 has revealed he could pay for £ 7billion of promised @entity2 tax cuts by continuing his austerity programme after he has cleared the deficit			1
the chancellor is planning to run a £ 23billion surplus in 2018/19 - three years after the election			1
mr @entity0 today revealed he could use the surplus to raise the personal tax threshold to £ 12,500 and the point at which the 40p higher rate starts to £ 50,000			1
the chancellor is planning to run a £ 23billion surplus in 2018/19 - three years after the election - which could pay for @entity16 's £ 7billion tax cut the chancellor said he ‘ completely ’ agreed with former education secretary @entity17 , who claimed earlier this week that the money could come from the surplus predicted by the @entity20			1
in comments which appeared to suggest that the cuts may not come until the final year of the next @entity23 , @entity2 chief whip mr @entity17 told @entity25 's @entity24 that the @entity20 was predicting a surplus of £ 23 billion by 2019/20 under @entity2 plans			1
he said : ‘ within that , we can afford to have tax cuts			1
if you 've got £ 23 billion spare , left over , then you can take £ 7 billion out of that for tax cuts			1
’ speaking to business leaders in @entity36 as part of his tour of the north - west with mr @entity16 , the chancellor said : ‘ what @entity17 is saying - and i completely agree with him - is the spending plans we have set out show you can deliver a surplus			1
‘ i think it is perfectly consistent to have spending plans that deliver the surplus , that reduce the national debt and to deliver those tax cuts that we have promised the @entity51 people because they are all part of the long - term economic plan			1
‘ the forecast surplus is £ 23 billion by the end of this decade			2
those spending plans deliver economic security and by having a surplus you can not only eliminate your deficit but you can start to get your debt down			2
‘ our national debt is too high			0
it went up a lot in the economic crisis because we had a high deficit and we kept adding to that debt			0
that leaves the @entity51 exposed to the next shock			0
’ in june 2010 , the @entity68 predicted that in 2014 - 15 borrowing would fall to just £ 37billion , but it has remained high at around £ 100billion and is not expected to return a surplus until 2018 - 19 with @entity51 borrowing billions every year , the total net public debt is set to top £ 1.5trillion before the end of the decade in that context he said it was a ‘ sensible approach ’ to put economic security and stability first as without that none of the economic plan would work			2
but he added : ‘ consistent with that and at the same time we can also deliver tax cuts for working people			1
this is not a bolt - on to our plan			0
this is also central to our plans so that in this country you are incentivised to work , you are rewarded for your hard work			0
‘ in this @entity23 we have managed to achieve £ 9 billion of income tax reductions by increasing the tax - free personal allowance whilst cutting the deficit in half and delivering economic stability again to our country			2
‘ we have shown you can do it , we have got the spending plans that show you can manage the public finances and deliver that surplus			0
‘ we must learn the lesson that you should fix the roof when the sun is shining			0
the economy will , by the latter part of this decade , have been growing for seven or eight years			0
if you are not using that period to be paying down your debts , when are you paying down your debts ? ’ this was in contrast , he went on , to labour who he said did not want to reduce the national debt			0
he added : ‘ they say they will run a deficit forever			2
i say that is repeating the mistakes of the past , that is borrowing against our country 's future and our children 's future			0
it leaves our country exposed , as it was when the financial crash happened			0
