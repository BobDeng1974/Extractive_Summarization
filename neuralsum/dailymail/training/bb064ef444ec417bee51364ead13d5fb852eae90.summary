a @entity1 journalist who openly admits to being a ' friend ' of @entity4 commanders has said he will do ' everything ' in his power to negotiate the release of two men held hostage by the @entity11 militants			1
@entity12 , who claims to have developed deep contacts within @entity4 , appeared on @entity1 television to say he is willing to step in and negotiate on the hostages behalf			1
however , he says the authorities refuse to speak to him as he may be prosecuted under @entity1 terrorist laws after being stopped from travelling to @entity18 last year			0
police are said to allege he was planning to escort one young would - be jihadist to the country - a charge he denies			0
the journalist , who converted to @entity23 , has faced criticism after he was pictured holding a gun in front of the @entity4 flag - a picture which he described as nothing more than an ' amusing souvenir '			1
friend or foe ? pictures of @entity12 like this one , in front of an @entity4 flag , have raised eyebrows in his home country			1
but he claims he could help free the two @entity1 hostages being threatened with execution a video of journalist @entity40 and military contractor @entity41 , kneeling in orange jumpsuits next to a hooded man , was released earlier this week , demanding $ 200m from @entity1 in return for their release			1
if the demands were not met , then they would be the next victims of executioner ' @entity51 ' , the video claimed			0
@entity12 offered the @entity1 government help dealing with @entity4 on a post on his @entity54 on wednesday and again at a press conference in @entity56 on thursday			1
' despite being detained illegally by @entity56 police and suffering a house search , i am willing to cooperate with the foreign office and even the police for the purpose of rescuing @entity1 hostages , ' he said			2
but @entity12 , who converted to @entity23 about 15 years ago and is one of the only journalists who have been allowed in to report from inside the caliphate , has warned he will only be able to negotiate if the @entity1 authorities give him ' space '			1
' we can not make an attempt to make a contact with them right now as it contains risks to our contacts , now that @entity1 police have traced down information of the contacts of @entity79 and are now bugging them , ' the foreign correspondent wrote on his blog			1
@entity4 has said they will release journalist @entity81 and military contractor @entity41 - who have been seen in this video - in return for $ 200million - the amount @entity1 has pledged to help fight @entity4 @entity12 claims his links to @entity4 led to him being invited to @entity18 last september by the militants to act as an interpreter and translator for the ' trial ' of @entity91 last october			1
trials of hostages are common practice within the @entity79 , according to @entity12			2
' an invitation came to me from @entity4 commander @entity98 , one of the high up militants , ' the source revealed			0
' i was making plans to be there to do what he could for @entity104 who was a hostage of @entity4 and was to be tried under @entity23 law			2
' but he was unable to travel to @entity18 after the @entity1 authorities seized his passport , after they accused him of helping one young man 's attempt to reach the country , where the student allegedly planned on becoming a fighter			1
but @entity12 said that , contrary to what the police believe , he was detained just as he was about to leave @entity1 for @entity18 to help @entity41			2
he claims to have known the approximate whereabouts of @entity41 at that time - and claims a botched rescue attempt by the @entity119 last year means the hostages have since been moved			2
' last september , @entity4 contacted me and asked me to meet mr @entity104			0
they said , they will arrange a meeting in @entity122 - so i guessed mr @entity104 was somewhere nearby , ' he said			0
but the foreign correspondent has already raised eyebrows in his home country when pictures of him posing with a @entity127 in front of an @entity4 flag emerged			1
the 45 - year - old has also been photographed with militant ' @entity131 the @entity18 ' , raising his index finger - a gesture which has become a sign of @entity4 ' cause			2
he revealed in a piece piece written for @entity137 : ' @entity131 the @entity18 , from the @entity4 , ... accepted me and treated me as a friend			0
' @entity12 - who says he can not see the moral problem with befriending jihadists - went on to claim the pictures were just ' amusing souvenirs '			2
symbol : @entity12 has also be photographed with alleged @entity4 militant ' @entity131 the @entity18 ' with his index finger raised - a gesture which has become a symbol of militant 's cause ' as for those photos with me holding a gun under the @entity154 banner , let me assure you that i do n't know how to use firearms and that these pictures have no political intent			1
they are amusing souvenirs , nothing more , ' he wrote			0
he is now calling on the @entity1 government to appoint him and leading @entity1 @entity165 professor @entity164 to negotiate a settlement over the two @entity1 hostages			1
the two claim to have built trust by using the @entity165 network and offering humanitarian aid			0
' @entity172 and mr @entity164 are eligible for such negotiations because until last october , we had been communicating each with a direct subordinate ( executive ) under the delegate in charge of kidnapping mr @entity104			0
at that time , they told us that , they will not request ransom or either display execution of hostage , ' he said - although he did not say why @entity4 commanders changed their minds about the ransom			2
@entity12 - who was kept captive for five months in @entity187 in 2010 - was also highly critical of the way in which @entity1 handles hostage negotiations			1
' i know enough about this type of ransom demand , ' he told @entity193			0
' i was also kidnapped before in @entity187			0
' despite a flood of type of blackmails from my embassy asking randomly for my release , the @entity1 @entity194 corresponded with my captors in an extremely cold manner			0
but , in the end , i was released thanks to my own efforts			0
â€™ @entity12 - who says he was dubbed mr @entity205 the @entity206 by his captors - say he was released when it became clear no ransom would be forthcoming from the @entity1			1
however , other reports say he was released after tricking his captors into allowing him to send a message on @entity212 , which he was using under the guise of teaching them about the social network			0
the @entity1 foreign ministry says the kidnappers have made no official contact with the @entity1 government so far and declined to comment on mr @entity12 or mr. @entity164 's offer of opening up communications with @entity222			2
@entity1 's prime minister @entity223 - pictured with his wife @entity224 - has said he will stop at nothing to secure the release of the two hostages the country has a mixed record on paying ransoms to hostage takers			1
in 1977 , the then @entity1 prime minister , @entity232 , drew accusations of caving in to terrorists when he paid a $ 6million ransom to @entity237 members who had hijacked a @entity239 flight en route from @entity56 to @entity241 , forcing it to land in @entity242			0
the deadline for the ransom payment is expected to come just before 3pm on friday .			0

@entity12 - a @entity165 convert - is allowed to travel within the caliphate
claims he was invited to be ' witness and interpreter ' at hostage 's trial
but a photo of him posing with an @entity4 flag raised *concerns* over friendship
@entity1 police have removed @entity12 's passport after *raiding* his home
but he says he is still willing to negotiate for hostages ' ' immediate release '
