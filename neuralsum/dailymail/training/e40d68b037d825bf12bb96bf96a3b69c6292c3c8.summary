by @entity0 vets have been left baffled after a lost @entity3 cat was found wandering in the @entity4 - 1,500 miles from his home			1
the cat , which vets have renamed @entity9 , was brought in as a stray by a woman who found him looking thin and hungry in her garden in @entity14 , @entity15 - but a microchip revealed he was registered in @entity3			1
vets still have no idea how the intrepid cat was able to make his trip across @entity3 , @entity22 and the @entity23 - a journey which would take 24 hours to drive			1
he is now fit and healthy again after a month of care the black - and - white cat , which always drools slightly , was taken to @entity36 in @entity14 , where a scan of his microchip revealed that he had come from @entity3 , though vets were unable to trace an exact address			1
@entity43 , a nurse at the practice , said : ' we have absolutely no idea how @entity29 got to @entity47			2
' he was dropped off by a member of the public who found him in their garden and said he looked a bit thin			1
' we 've checked his microchip which is registered in @entity3 but there is no way of knowing who he belongs to			2
' he 's got a blue velvet collar on but there are no contact details on there either			0
' the cat , believed to be 10 years old , has been given his new name as an old jaw injury means he ca n't stop dribbling when it comes close to mealtimes			2
plenty of cuddles : veterinary nurse @entity43 , pictured left with veterinary surgeon @entity68 , said that @entity29 is still a ' really friendly feline ' - even after his 1,500 - mile trip from his home in @entity3 ready to eat : an old jaw injury means that @entity29 's mouth hangs open slightly and leaves him with a little patch of drool on his chin - especially when he gets hungry before mealtimes it is thought that it was injured in a car accident that left it with a fractured jaw which vets believe was never properly treated			1
despite the injury , the intrepid cat has n't been put off his food and is now back to full health after being cared for almost a month			0
ms @entity43 said : ' he does n't seem to be in pain with his mouth			0
he still eats a lot and it is quite cute when he gets excited before meal times and starts drooling			0
' after all he 's been through , he 's still a really friendly feline			0
all he wants is cuddles			0
