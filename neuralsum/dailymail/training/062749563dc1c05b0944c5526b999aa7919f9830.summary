by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 former @entity4 academy graduate @entity3 has hit back at @entity6 's accusation that @entity4 have ' lost the way ' by splurging £ 150million on foreign imports			1
@entity4 shipped out homegrown players in @entity10 , who was sold to @entity11 , and @entity12 , who joined @entity13 on loan , to help pay for their summer spree , which included @entity17 's £ 6million season - long loan on £ 280,000 - per - week wages			1
but while @entity6 lamented what he saw as the loss of a @entity4 identity cultivated by sir @entity22 , @entity3 says @entity23 had no choice but to overhaul his squad and stop the ' death by 1000 cuts ' being suffered at @entity28 since the legendary @entity30 's retirement			1
' @entity10 , @entity40 and @entity12 ( were ) never ( seen ) as @entity4 players			2
' drastic action was needed			0
pursuing the path @entity4 were on was death by 1000 cuts			2
quality of competing clubs was way better			0
' @entity3 burst into the @entity4 first team in 1993 as a lightning - quick winger in the mould of @entity52 , but a series of personal issues , most notably a gambling addiction , meant he never fulfilled his huge potential			1
nevertheless , the @entity57 enjoyed a top - flight career at @entity4 , @entity59 and @entity60 , and won 86 caps for his country			2
concerns : @entity6 says @entity4 have lost their way with their summer spending class of 92 : @entity3 ( second right ) alongside @entity4 's most famous youth team , which included @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 , who all became legends at @entity28 despite his breakthrough as a footballer coming through the ranks at @entity28 , @entity3 insists that @entity4 must not be hampered by an ideal of developing youth players and instead should do anything required to achieve success on the pitch - even if that means making a break from @entity22 's methods			1
' the @entity4 philosophy should be to compete and succeed at the highest level , ' he added			0
' it was n't working			0
i believe it will now			0
' @entity93 have to have the best players available to compete			0
any youth system might assist in that quest but can not be relied upon			0
star signing : @entity98 joined @entity4 from @entity99 for £ 59.7m finally , @entity3 posed a teasing question to @entity22 's former assistant : ' the question for @entity6 is if he had an option of @entity10 or @entity17 in his team who would he choose ? ' @entity107 's summer spending spree has included a @entity109 transfer record of £ 60m on @entity98 , plus @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , and @entity113			1
@entity6 suggested this showed a lack of faith in @entity4 's youth system , renowned in the past for its production line of world - class talent like @entity69 , @entity52 and @entity70 , who played alongside @entity3 in @entity4 's youth teams			1
' interesting how things have changed at @entity4 now , ' said @entity6 , @entity22 's right - hand man between 2008 and 2013 , to @entity123			1
' a good young kid ( @entity10 ) coming through - part of the academy system - and they 've finally decided now that might not be the way to go so they 've moved him on			2
' obviously there is more and more money now in the game , looking further and further afield for players but probably they have lost the way of @entity4 a little bit in the fact that now rather than produce it may be the case where they 're buying in			0

@entity4 spent over £ 150m on new signings this summer transfer window
@entity17 joined on loan on transfer deadline day
@entity98 , @entity110 , @entity112 and @entity113 also signed
@entity6 has said the club have a lack of faith in their academy system
