by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 boss @entity2 believes former @entity5 trio @entity4 , @entity6 and @entity7 will all settle in quickly at the club			1
@entity2 cites the similarities in playing styles between the @entity12 runners - up and the south coast outfit as to why his three summer signings will find life at @entity16 a smoother transition than normally expected with a new arrival			1
the @entity3 boss spent a combined £ 49million to bring the trio to @entity21 and says @entity5 's offensive and aggressive style of play should mean they adapt quicker to his methods at the club			1
' all the players we have brought in were done so because of their profile			0
@entity5 played in a really offensive , aggressive way and the players that have come in will adapt that little bit quicker to that			0
' there are obviously pressures			0
if you 're playing for @entity3 , there 's a different adaptation altogether , but in terms of the football style , that will make it easier			2
' i think if you have three players coming in from the same club , of course it always helps on that first day walking into the changing room			0
' ultimately they 'll gain respect because they 're good players , and that 's why they 're at @entity3			2
hopefully they can show that over their career here			0
' third musketeer : @entity4 joined @entity3 last month in a £ 20million transfer			1
