' friends of friends who wanted to lose weight also added me on @entity16 so they could see the meals @entity23 was making for me			1
' four months later , @entity10 was already three stone lighter			2
before beginning her reduced - calorie diet , breakfast for @entity10 would typically involve a full cooked meal of sausage , bacon , eggs , potato scone and black pudding , followed by a mid-morning snack of crisps or chocolate with a glass of cola			1
lunch would be a @entity127 and , in the evening , she would tuck into lasagna and chips , with crisps and dips to nibble on before bedtime			0

dinner typically involves low - calorie noodles and seafood , with low fat yogurt for a snack			0
but as she got closer to her target , she found it harder to shift the last few pounds - and it was the support from @entity16 friends that kept her going			2
