@entity0 has labelled @entity2 fans hypocrites for slating @entity4 imports @entity7 and @entity8 when @entity10 ’s squad contains @entity6 - born stars			1
the 38 - year - old goalkeeper , capped 126 times by the @entity13 , has been angered by the barbs aimed at the @entity16 - raised pair in the build - up to friday ’s @entity19 qualifier			2
he took particular aim at @entity22 legend @entity21 , who has called for the @entity23 to give the @entity25 duo a ‘ horrible reception ’ at @entity27			2
@entity0 believes @entity2 fans are hypocrites for slating @entity7 and @entity8 @entity25 and @entity29 winger @entity7 was born and raised in @entity22 , but chose to play for roi given insists double standards are at play and questioned whether @entity8 and @entity7 playing for the land of their grandparents is any different to the @entity36 at @entity10 ’s disposal			1
four players in the pool to face @entity40 — @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 — were born south of the border , although it ’s fair to say that none of that quartet actually turned down @entity6 in favour of @entity22			1
regardless , given was unhappy at the treatment of his team - mates , saying : ‘ i felt the comments were out of order over the past couple of days			0
they were a bit unfair as some of the @entity2 players were born in @entity6 but have @entity2 parents and that			1
‘ it ca n’t be one rule for @entity40 and one rule for others			0
they are in the exact same situation , so some of the comments were a bit personal and a wee bit over the top			0
’ asked if he was referring to @entity21 , given replied : ‘ that ’s who i mean , yeah			0
’ @entity8 is a major injury doubt for friday ’s @entity19 showdown at @entity27 he added : ‘ i just think there is no need to go to that sort of level			2
as i say , they have players in their squad as well who were n’t born in @entity22 and playing for them			1
‘ they are the rules and every country is the same			0
i think it was unfair on @entity8 and @entity7 to single them out			1
‘ you could go round every country in @entity91 and say there are players born in different countries			2
‘ but they are great players and that ’s probably why we are standing here talking about them , because they [ the @entity2 ] probably wish they were playing for @entity22			1
’ @entity10 has suggested fans can boo @entity7 and @entity8 – who is an injury doubt with a hamstring problem – as long as it ’s ‘ pantomime humour ’			1
@entity29 manager @entity102 was reluctant to be drawn too far into the debate but was puzzled by his counterpart ’s stance			0
@entity29 boss @entity102 has no doubt @entity7 and @entity8 will handle any flak ‘ i ’m not really sure i share @entity10 ’s view , ’ he said			1
‘ i ’ve been in the game a long time but i ’ve never heard of gentle booing in my life			0
‘ i suppose no amount of pleading on the other side is going to prevent anything that might occur			0
@entity8 and @entity7 are very fine players and i think they will be okay			1
’ @entity102 , meanwhile , is willing to give @entity8 until the last minute to prove his fitness for friday night ’s game			2
‘ we ’ll play it day by day with @entity8 , ’ said @entity102			2
‘ it ’s only less than 48 hours since he had a strain and we ’ll see how he is ‘ he ’s played a lot of games as @entity25 are also involved heavily in the @entity124			0
i think it ’s one of those situations where you really would have to wait until the last minute			0
’ striker @entity128 was ruled out @entity40 yesterday but @entity102 is hopeful @entity130 left - back @entity129 will be available .			0

@entity7 and @entity8 were both born in @entity22
but they *pledged* their *allegiance* to the @entity13
@entity0 believes @entity2 fans are being hypocritical
