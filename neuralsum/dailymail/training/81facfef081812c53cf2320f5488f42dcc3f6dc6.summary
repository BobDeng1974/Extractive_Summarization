by @entity0 published : 06:48 est , 20 march 2012 updated : 12:16 est , 20 march 2012 difficult job : detectives are asking members of the public if they recognise this man - who appears to be headless in this image - following a series of arson attacks in @entity9 when detectives find a picture of that vital person they need to speak too following a crime , it makes their job all the more easier			1
but the @entity16 may find it difficult to track down this man			2
officers are asking members of the public if they recognise him following a series of arson attacks in @entity9			1
there is just one problem - he appears to be headless			2
a source at the @entity16 confirmed it was the best image they had of the man they want to speak too			2
perhaps unsurprisingly , it is not believed anybody has yet identified him			0
detective sergeant @entity33 , of @entity34 , who is investigating the fire , said : ' the quality of the image is quite grainy , and the suspect is covering his face , however we are releasing this image in the hope that someone may recognise this person by the clothes he is wearing , his build or even his gait			1
' it 's often the case that a @entity51 image of a person may appear unrecognisable but can often be identified by someone they live with or work closely with			0
' police believe the man could hold vital information following a fire at @entity59 in @entity60 in january , which caused damage to a door and the roof of the building			1
detectives think this incident could be linked to a series of arson attacks in the @entity60 area			1
this includes one in the early hours of sunday in which eight @entity72 engines attended to reports of a fire at the rear of a tyre shop in @entity78 , @entity79 which had spread to the @entity81 next door			0
residents from the flats above the premises were evacuated following the blaze			0
unique features : @entity87 issued this very strange e-fit image of a man in 2010 other police forces have previously being criticised over unusual e-fits which they have released			1
police in @entity95 were branded ' absolutely ludicrous ' after issuing an e-fit of a burglary suspect with what appeared to be a lettuce balanced on his head residents were astounded when confronted with the image , with many ridiculing the artist 's impression			1
one local declared : ' it looks more like a bald man stood in front of an iceberg lettuce			0
i ca n't imagine anyone actually has a hairstyle like that			0
odd : police in @entity95 also released this e-fit of a boy believed to be just nine ' it 's absolutely ludicrous - the funniest e-fit i have ever seen			1
' the same force was also criticised for issuing an e-fit of a boy believed to be just nine years old - below the age of criminality , meaning even if he was caught he could not have been prosecuted			0
the wanted boy was said to have knocked another youngster to the ground and kicked him in the head when he refused to let go of his toy in a park			0
@entity95 police defended the move , saying there was no cctv in the @entity134 park where the assault happened .			2

officers are asking the public if they recognise him following a series of arson attacks in @entity9
it follows a number of *bizarre* e-fits from other police forces
