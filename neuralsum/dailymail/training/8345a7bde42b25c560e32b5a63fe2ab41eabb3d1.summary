@entity1 head coach @entity0 believes they have pulled off quite a coup in coaxing @entity4 from @entity5 , having lost star turn @entity7 to the west @entity9 club			1
impressive performances for club and country saw the @entity13 fork out £ 26.8million to bring the @entity15 star from the @entity16 to @entity17 earlier this month			2
@entity19 's deadline - day move to west @entity9 paved the way for @entity4 to go the other way , having endured a frustrating first year at @entity17			0
@entity1 boss @entity0 believes they 've pulled off a coup in coaxing @entity4 from @entity5 the sale of their star @entity7 to the west @entity9 club is also something for @entity1 to be proud of the @entity30 international will spend the rest of the campaign on loan at @entity1 , for whom he netted one and provided another in saturday 's 3 - 1 win at @entity38 - a display @entity0 believes is just the start			1
' well , i think we pulled off a bit of coup ourselves in signing @entity4 , ' the former @entity42 loanee said ahead of their @entity48 tie with @entity49			1
' joking aside , it is almost a sign of professional pride that someone wanted to pay so much for @entity19 and that he developed so much as a player			2
' he certainly was n't at that level when he first arrived to play for us , so i think us , the management , the players are very proud about how far he has been able to go with our help			0
@entity0 says @entity7 was n't a £ 26.8m - worthy player when he first arrived at the @entity65 club ' but we have n't just replaced him with one player , we have replaced him with several players			1
' @entity4 is a very good player , he is used to playing at this level and although he has only been with us a short while , he has already shown very quickly that he is certainly up to playing very well in @entity65 and playing well for us			0
' @entity0 's side are flying right now , arriving in north @entity9 with a @entity72 semi-final to look forward to and their hopes of @entity75 qualification alive			2
@entity4 is one of several players @entity1 have brought in with the fee from @entity5 for the @entity78 @entity49 , too , have enjoyed an impressive time of late , thanks in no small part to the exquisite form of homegrown star @entity83			1
the 21 - year - old 's incredible progress makes him a shoe - in for the next @entity87 squad and has caught the attention of @entity1 captain @entity89 ahead of the last - 32 first leg tie			0
' we have seen him the way that he has exploded onto the scene and no doubt that he is one of their best players , ' the defender said			0
' we know he is a goalscorer and he need to mark him as best we can and try to stop him scoring			0
