by @entity0 published : 10:40 est , 11 october 2012 updated : 19:21 est , 11 october 2012 tourism numbers during the @entity3 fell to their lowest summer level for almost ten years as travellers were put off by warnings of gridlock and chaos			1
although the government had boasted the @entity12 would deliver a boost to retailers , restaurants and attractions , foreign visitors to the @entity10 actually fell 5 per cent compared with 2011			1
the figures , by the @entity18 , showed 3.03million tourists arrived in @entity10 in august – 176,000 less than the same time last year			1
some of @entity22 's busiest roads , including @entity23 above , were deserted during the @entity3 it was the lowest august number since 2003 , when @entity26 ’s government joined @entity27 in invading @entity28 – resulting in foreign tourism , particularly from the @entity27 , falling sharply			1
taking july and august together , the total number of tourists was 6.21million – a decrease of 358,000			2
the figures follow complaints by business leaders during the @entity12 that overblown warnings of travel chaos had turned some key tourism sites into ‘ ghost towns ’			1
at the time , photos taken outside normally busy attractions such as the @entity42 and @entity43 showed the normal summer queues were absent			0
a survey of @entity22 restaurants also found takings were down by an average of 40 per cent			0
tourism chiefs also pointed to the unusually wet summer as having put some visitors off			0
despite this , then culture minister @entity52 denied that businesses were suffering , saying : ‘ this is absolute nonsense and we have just got to knock this on the head			0
tourism bosses hope the millions worldwide who watched the @entity12 , including the @entity62 closing ceremony above , will now consider holidaying in the @entity10 ‘ anyone who has a business anywhere in @entity22 is frankly quids in			1
some @entity66 businesses have done extremely well because they ’ve marketed on the back of the @entity3			0
some businesses have taken a hit , others are doing well , but overall there is a big increase in business in the @entity74			0
’ but @entity75 , chief executive of @entity77 , which runs the @entity78 and @entity79 , and is the second - largest attractions operator in the world behind @entity82 , said yesterday : ‘ these figures make clear @entity52 had no idea what he was talking about			0
‘ the government ’s warnings to stay away from @entity22 worked all too well			0
the @entity3 was a marvellous opportunity to showcase what @entity10 has to offer			2
‘ everyone involved in delivering the @entity12 did a wonderful job			0
‘ but the country can not be quids in and can not get a return on the £ 10billion it cost without a radical change in its approach to tourism			0
’ the @entity18 figures also revealed that while the number of foreign tourists fell in august , the amount they spent increased by 9 per cent to £ 2.4billion			1
it is hoped the @entity12 showcased venues across the country , including @entity22 , @entity106 , and @entity107 , where @entity10 's @entity108 and @entity109 won gold medal in the women 's pair final however , this was mainly due to the cost of @entity3 tickets rather than a rise in spending in shops , hotels and restaurants			1
@entity120 and tourism minister @entity121 said : ‘ this summer put the @entity10 firmly in the global spotlight , allowing us to shape international perceptions and help deliver long - term trade and tourism benefits			2
‘ the @entity3 generated record tourist spend , up 9 per cent on august last year , helping to boost the country ’s economy and giving us enormous confidence as we build on the fantastic showcase of this summer			2
‘ and domestic tourism was also strong , with more than £ 760million spent on @entity3 - related day trips			2
‘ we also know some tourists may not have wanted to come during the @entity12 , which is why we focused on building a long - term tourism legacy			1

in august foreign visitor numbers were five per cent down on last year
but the 3million who did travel to the @entity10 spent more than usual
ministers under *pressure* to secure tourism legacy , as hotel guide *author* 's warn of a ' *deplorable* *policy* of *neglect* ’ towards the *industry*
