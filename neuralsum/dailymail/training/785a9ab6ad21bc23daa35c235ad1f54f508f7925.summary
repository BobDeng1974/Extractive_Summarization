@entity1 actress @entity0 has waded into the class row between popstar @entity3 and @entity5 mp @entity4 @entity0 has claimed that working - class children ' are n't represented ' in the arts			1
the @entity9 actress , who was honoured with a @entity11 fellowship last year , branded it ' really sad ' that youngsters from privileged backgrounds were enjoying all the breaks			2
the 64 - year - old star of @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 , appears to back the argument of the @entity22 arts minister , @entity4			1
the @entity5 mp claimed @entity1 culture was ' dominated ' by stars like @entity3 and @entity26 who went to expensive boarding schools			1
harrow educated @entity3 hit back calling the politician a ' classist gimp , ' and ' prejudiced wazzock ' who was using the ' politics of jealousy ' to win votes			1
' working - class kids are n't represented , ' mrs @entity0 said in an interview with the @entity37			1
' it 's really sad			1
' i think it means that we 're going to get loads more middle - class drama			1
' it will be middle - class people playing working - class people , like it used to be			1
' mrs @entity0 , whose grew up in @entity47 with her builder father and clerical assistant mother , was awarded a ' full grant ' to study at @entity51			2
but she said she would fail to make it today because she would not be able to go to college			2
after finishing college @entity0 went onto start her career at @entity57 's @entity56 , working with the likes of @entity59 and @entity60 in working - class drama			1
' i do n't know how you get into it now , ' ms @entity62 , who was @entity64 - nominated for her turn , opposite @entity66 , in the 1983 film educating @entity68 , told the newspaper magazine			2
she said that she does n't ' know what to tell , ' the kids that write to her asking for advice to break into acting			2
mrs @entity0 , who won a @entity11 in 2010 for her performance as @entity79 in @entity81 's @entity80 , reportedly said it was not just a problem for actors , but also writers			1
in his letter to mr @entity4 , @entity3 claimed that the £ 30,000 a year boarding school he attended did nothing to help him break into the music industry			1
the @entity91 award - winner also claims that people in the music industry tried to get him to change his accent so he sounded less posh			1
@entity3 opened his letter to mr @entity4 by accusing him of being a ' classist gimp ' , despite the fact that the @entity5 mp himself was privately educated at £ 20,000 a year @entity99 before attending @entity100			1
ms @entity0 , pictured above in the movie calendar girls , said that she ' does n't know how , ' people get into acting today in @entity3 's letter , he wrote : ' i happened to go to a boarding school			1
no one helped me at boarding school to get into the music business			0
' he added : ' i bought my first guitar with money i saved from holiday jobs ( sandwich packing ! )			0
i was taught the only four chords i know by a friend			0
' no one at school had any knowledge or contacts in the music business , and i was expected to become a soldier or a lawyer or perhaps a stockbroker			0
so alien was it , that people laughed at the idea of me going into the music business , and certainly no one was of any use			0
' @entity3 said even in the army , which he joined after university , he was told that trying to become a pop star was a ' mad idea '			2
he wrote : ' and when i left the army , going against everyone 's advice , everyone i met in the @entity1 music industry told me there was no way it would work for me because i was too posh			1
one record company even asked if i could speak in a different accent			0
( i told them i could try @entity146 )			0
@entity147 @entity3 , pictured left , branded @entity5 mp @entity4 , pictured right , a ' classiest gimp ' after he attacked the number of posh actors and musicians ' every step of the way , my background has been against me succeeding in the music business			1
and when i have managed to break through , i was still scoffed at for being too posh for the industry			2
' he added : ' you come along , looking for votes , telling working class people that posh people like me do n't deserve it , and that we must redress the balance			1
' but it is your populist , envy - based , vote - hunting ideas which make our country crap , far more than me and my s * * * songs , and my plummy accent			0
' i got signed in @entity176 , where they do n't give a stuff about , or even understand what you mean by me and ' my ilk ' , you prejudiced wazzock , and i worked my a * * * off			0
' what you teach is the politics of jealousy			0
rather than celebrating success and figuring out how we can all exploit it further as the @entity176 do , you instead talk about how we can hobble that success and ' level the playing field '			0
' perhaps what you 've failed to realise is that the only head - start my school gave me in the music business , where the @entity195 majority of people are not from boarding school , is to tell me that i should aim high			0
perhaps it protected me from your kind of narrow - minded , self - defeating , lead - us - to - a - dead - end , remove - the - ' g ' - from - ' gb ' thinking , which is to look at others ' success and say , ' it 's not fair '			1
' @entity3 signed off his letter : ' up yours			2
' but mr @entity4 accused the pop star of being ' blooming precious '			2
in a letter in response , the mp wrote : ' i 'm not knocking your success			0
i even contributed to it by buying one of your albums			0
i 'm not knocking @entity26 , either			0
he was the best @entity215 i have ever seen			0
' if you 'd read the whole of my interview , you 'd have seen that i make the point that the people who subsidise the arts the most are artists themselves			0
of course that includes you			0
' but it is a statement of the blindingly obvious that that is far tougher if you come from a poor family where you have to hand over your holiday earnings to help pay the family bills			0

@entity0 says that working - class kids ' are n't represented ' in the arts
says it 's ' really sad ' and will result in more middle - class drama being made
claims middle - class actors will end up playing the working - class parts
says because of her background she would not have made it today
comes after *public* row between singer @entity3 and mp @entity4
@entity5 mp attacked the number of posh musicians and actors in @entity1
