by @entity0 published : 07:31 est , 14 october 2013 updated : 16:27 est , 14 october 2013 it must rank as one of the most quintessentially @entity3 of scenes			0
punts glide serenely on the water during the last sunny days of autumn … a family picnics on a grassy bank … ducks paddle silently by			0
but then the peace is shattered by a swan named @entity13 – and no duck , boater or passer - by is safe as he continues his father ’s mission to terrorise the waterways of @entity19			1
unless , that is , you happen to be one ton of prime @entity24 bullock			2
confrontation : the violent swan known as ' @entity13 ' came face to face with a bullock yesterday loser : @entity13 was forced to back down by his much bigger rival on the tow path the @entity32 ’s most vicious swan met its match in one particular opponent who apparently decided enough was enough			1
with all the confidence gained from months of scaring off intruders on its city centre territory , the cocky cob had squared up to the bullock which had been grazing quietly nearby			2
seconds later , however , the swan was forced to retreat when the beast drove him back into the water			1
the scene was a rare defeat for @entity13 , son of another swan that famously ruled the roost on the @entity32			1
mr @entity50 , as his dad was nicknamed , spent most of his life chasing canoeists and boaters and biting intruders before conservationists relocated him 60 miles away and clipped his wings to stop him returning			1
escape : the swan proceeded to hop back into the river , watched by the large bullock victory : the encounter was a rare defeat for @entity13 , who has developed a fearsome reputation on the @entity32 that was nearly 18 months ago			1
then , last summer , @entity67 stepped in to carry on the family tradition			0
the chip off the old block also turned his anger on fellow swans			0
this weekend , horrified tourists saw @entity13 ferociously grab a passing swan by the neck with his beak , hold it under water for 15 seconds – then sit on it to stop it wriggling free			1
the hapless victim escaped the attack only when its partner came to the rescue			0
‘ i have never seen such a vicious swan , ’ said nearby resident @entity83 , 52			0
‘ he appears to be even worse than his dad			0
i ’ve seen him swimming up and down the river close to the punts and he has even attacked a few punting poles			2
earlier : @entity13 was seen suddenly attacking another swan and biting it in the neck vicious : @entity13 is the son of ' mr @entity50 ' , who has been moved after terrorising rowers and tourists ‘ people fear he will be a repeat of his dad and some are now too frightened to go out on the water when he ’s around			1
’ the bullock versus swan encounter happened when @entity13 left the water to challenge the grazing creature			1
unperturbed , the bullock simply advanced to push the swan back down the bank			2
‘ i do n’t think the swan was ever going to win that particular fight , ’ said a riverbank spectator			0
‘ the bullock really put him in his place – but i got the feeling it was a tactical withdrawal			0
' i ’m sure @entity13 will live to fight another day			2
i do n’t think we ’ve seen the last of that particular swan			0
' brutal : tourists in @entity19 screamed in horror when they witnessed the two birds fighting reputation : @entity13 is fast developing a reputation for being just as vicious as his notorious father			1

@entity123 dubbed ' @entity13 ' viciously attacked another bird in @entity19
but when he came face to face with a bullock he was forced to back down
@entity13 is the son of ' mr @entity50 ' , who has now been moved from @entity32
