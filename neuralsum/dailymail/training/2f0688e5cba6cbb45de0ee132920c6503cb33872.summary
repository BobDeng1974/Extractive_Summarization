two out of three @entity0 have more than £ 50 worth of unspent foreign currency just lying around from their holidays , reveals a new study			1
a survey of 2,000 holidaymakers by @entity6 ( @entity7 ) says 49 per cent of us prefer to squirrel it away for our next trip away rather than have it converted back to pounds			1
just under a third of people returning from their escape convert their cash when they get home while the same amount of tourists will spend up at the airport lounge and gifts shops			1
hoarders : two out of three @entity0 have more than £ 50 in unspent foreign currency for their holidays saving it for later : almost half of @entity0 residents keep the foreign currency for the next trip abroad nothing , save it for my next trip - 49 % convert it when i arrive home - 32 % spend it at the airport - 32 % spend it on drinks or a meal - 18 % buy gifts for family / friends - 16 % use it to tip staff - 12 % give it to charity - 2.7 % source : @entity6 for the kind - hearted souls , 16 per cent of those surveyed will use their excess money on gifts for loved ones before they get home while three per cent will give the currency to charity and 12 per cent will tip their hotel staff			1
' if exchange rates were favourable when the currency was first ordered and another trip 's on the cards , you can understand why you would n't rush to convert leftover holiday money back into @entity57 , ' says @entity58 , chief operating officer for @entity6 , whose company offers a free quote for currency buy - back via text			1
' but with almost half of us hoarding foreign cash , the hassle factor probably plays a big part in the decision not to convert it back			1
' with 66 per cent of those surveyed having at least £ 50 in foreign cash , that could mean there is almost £ 1.7billion in other money going to waste in @entity0 homes just from this years holidays ( based on 53 per cent of @entity0 residents taking an overseas break this year according to travel organisation @entity78 )			1
keep an eye on exchange rates make a habit of having a look at the rates on your chosen currency each day , even multiple times a day , to get an idea of what is good value or a rip - off			1
@entity90 is simple and easy to use			2
@entity91 do n't take the easy option it 's so easy to just go to the window that says currency exchange and ask for some euros , but you could be doing yourself out of money			1
just as rates fluctuate , so do the providers			1
the best bet is to call around or use a comparison website such as @entity105 providers offer better deals online			2
or @entity6 offers a text - back quote so you can arrange pick - up from your nearest provider			2
@entity112 starts here bargaining is n't just for the souks , exchange rates can be negotiated too			2
did you see a better rate at another supplier ? the one right in front of you might match it			0
or if you have a large sum of money to change for a big trip you could get a slightly better rate			0
it never hurts to ask			0
@entity129 ' great ' deals using your card ( credit , debit , visa etc ) to get foreign currency is oh - so convenient , but could cost you the price of a drink at your destination			1
so ask if there are any fees that will be added			0
if a provider is spruiking the best deals or 0 per cent commission , it 's likely too good to be true as they 'll be making up for it some other way			0
@entity148 is king all banks are a bit different , so it 's worth checking fees			0
but to be safe , withdraw pounds from your bank 's atm and get cash converted			1
watch currency rates trends before your trip alternative forms of money travellers ' cheques are a handy alternative to carrying stacks of cash			1
they can be replaced if lost or stolen , which is handy			0
the catch is that you can only change them to six currencies			0
@entity172 is the most widely accepted			0
pre-paid cards can be helpful too , so you can put money you 'll need on it before you go and use instead of the card with your life savings attached			2
but again , beware fees			0
know what money you need currencies such as the @entity181 or @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity185 dollars are straightforward , but the way some countries use money differs			0
some may take local currency but prefer @entity182 dollars			2
@entity191 has different money for locals and tourists			0
@entity196 's dirham ca n't be exchanged outside the country			0
some research could really pay off .			0

66 % of @entity0 have more than £ 50 in unspent foreign currency
only third of holidaymakers get their travel cash changed back into pounds
16 % of returning travellers use leftover cash for gifts
