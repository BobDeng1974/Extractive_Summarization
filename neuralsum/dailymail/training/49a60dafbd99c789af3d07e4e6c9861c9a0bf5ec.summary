the country ’s biggest education authority has revived plans to open the first new grammar school in 50 years			1
@entity4 has asked education secretary @entity5 to approve its plans to open a ‘ satellite ’ grammar school to meet demand from a rising population			1
earlier proposals submitted by the authority were rejected by her predecessor @entity13			1
@entity4 has asked education secretary @entity5 to sanction a new grammar school the plans emerged as @entity18 mayor @entity17 described the decline of selection as a ‘ tragedy ’			1
@entity4 ’s proposals involve opening a grammar school in the town of @entity25 , which would operate as an ‘ annexe ’ to the existing @entity27 of @entity4 grammar nine miles away			1
mrs @entity29 is expected to rule on the plans before the election , throwing the spotlight on the bitterly - contested issue of academic selection in schools			1
@entity36 , the home secretary is already backing plans for a new grammar school annexe in her @entity41 constituency			2
@entity42 , the @entity43 and mp for @entity25 , has also supported the @entity4 school plan , saying it was ‘ deeply unfair to parents in my constituency ’ that the town did not have a grammar school			1
it came as mr @entity17 added his voice to calls for an expansion of selection , telling @entity60 : ‘ i think they are a very important part of the mix in our educational system , i think that they work very well in many areas and they should be supported			0
‘ i think that the decision to get rid of them was a real tragedy for this country			0
’ @entity70 passed laws in 1998 banning the opening of any more grammars because of the party ’s long - standing opposition to academic selection			2
but the @entity77 made it easier for the 163 remaining state grammar schools to open satellites to meet demand from parents for more places			0
@entity4 ’s original proposal was rejected last year because the annexe was considered too different from the ‘ parent ’ school			2
it had planned to admit both boys and girls , despite being sponsored by a single - sex girls ’ school			0
mayor of london @entity17 , pictured , described the decline of selection at schools as ' a tragedy ' under the revised plan , the new school will only admit girls and will be more closely linked to its sponsor school			1
@entity100 , the council leader , said : ‘ i am delighted that we now have a robust proposal to put to the secretary of state for her sign - off			0
‘ school rolls are rising dramatically and we must be allowed to expand grammar schools in line with all other categories and types of school			0
‘ this is good news for parents with daughters and we will continue to work in earnest to find a solution for their sons			0
‘ i am also delighted by the support from @entity36 and @entity42 for the establishment of further grammar school provision in their constituencies			2
’ a spokesman for the @entity125 said : ‘ we want good schools to be able to expand but they have to do so within the law			0
every application will have to be considered on its own merits			0
