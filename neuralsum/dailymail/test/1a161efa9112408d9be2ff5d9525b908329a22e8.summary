she 's enjoyed trips to @entity2 and @entity3 in the last week alone but today , princess @entity4 was spotted in a rather less glamorous location			1
the 26 - year - old was back on royal duties and travelled to @entity8 in @entity9 where she opened a new classroom at the @entity11			1
dressed in a teal frock and a tailored black jacket , @entity4 smiled broadly as she arrived to the sound of cheers from a group of flag - waving children who had waited outside the school for her			0
the space commemorates a little girl named @entity31 who was once a pupil at @entity32 but was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour and died in 2013			0
the multiple appearances complete an unusually busy few days for @entity4 who has come under fire of late , thanks to her penchant for international travel			1
however , @entity4 , who has no official royal duties , has long championed children 's educational causes and is herself dyslexic			2
criticism : the two engagements come after @entity4 was criticised for going on 14 trips in just six months royal salute : @entity4 got a salute as her convoy pulled up outside the @entity11 of @entity49 all business : @entity4 was making her second official visit in less than four days cheers : the 26 - year - old was greeted by a flag - waving crowd outside the school the 26 - year - old is also patron of a number of charities , among them the @entity60 and the @entity61			1
instead , @entity4 is , according to her father 's website , ' working full time in business ' - although that has n't prevented her from jetting off to glamorous destinations on a regular basis			2
last week , the @entity25 was spotted hobnobbing with designers @entity68 and @entity70 at a fashion conference in the city of @entity3			1
that trip came just a day after she was seen enjoying the company of @entity76 and @entity77 royalty at the @entity78 alongside her boyfriend @entity79 , 31			0
enjoying the outing : @entity4 certainly appeared to be enjoying her visit and smiled broadly ready : @entity4 whips the covering off a commemorative plaque and now for the big moment : she prepares to unveil the plaque in front of students sorted : the princess poses with headmaster dr @entity89 as she completes the unveiling signing in : before she left , @entity4 happily signed the visitor 's book more recently , @entity4 has enjoyed holidays in @entity94 and @entity95 , as well as making several trips to @entity97 to visit her sister , @entity98 , 25			2
like her sister , who has lived in the @entity101 since 2013 , @entity4 's jaunts could shortly become a permanent stay following the announcement that the @entity25 has taken a finance job there			0
@entity4 , who has not had a full - time job since leaving her Â£ 20,000 - a - year role at @entity108 last november , is yet to announce details of the position or a start date			0
mr @entity79 , a @entity112 executive , frequently joins the princess on her international travels and was by her side when she enjoyed not one but two holidays on the @entity119 island of @entity120 in january alone			0
job done ! the princess waved to students and staff as she was driven away from the school hobnobbing : @entity4 was at a fashion conference in @entity3 last week and is seen here with @entity127 @entity128 : days before , she had been spotted in @entity2 with @entity129 of @entity77 and @entity79 hitting the slopes : princess @entity4 enjoys her most recent ski break , in @entity94 at @entity132			1

princess @entity4 was hard at work opening a classroom in @entity9
visit was her second official engagement in less than four days
on friday , she opened a memorial *garden* at @entity32 in @entity141
but visits come shortly after another round of international travel
