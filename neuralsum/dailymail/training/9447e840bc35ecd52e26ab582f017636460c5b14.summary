by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 got off to a perfect start as @entity5 manager with a 7 - 0 victory			1
new boy @entity7 , signed from @entity8 for £ 24million this summer , stole the show with an impressive display in midfield as he created chance after chance for his new team - mates			2
@entity15 opened the scoring from distance before @entity18 scored a brace to give @entity5 a 3 - 0 lead at half - time			1
the second half saw 20 - year - old defender @entity24 score twice before @entity25 also scored two in the final minutes courtesy of @entity7 assists			1
click here to read @entity31 's match report from @entity32 host commentator @entity2 lands his first trophy as @entity5 manager ... the @entity36 ! what a performance from the @entity38 and in particular @entity7			1
the @entity39 was the star performer in the middle of the park with some exquisite passing			0
what a signing he could prove to be ! the 24 - year - old deserves his @entity46 award			0
great finish by @entity25 but once again it 's @entity7 with a wonderful through ball			1
@entity25 latches on to a perfectly - timed through ball from @entity7 and places the ball into an empty net after the goalkeeper rushed out			1
@entity24 may be a defender but he certainly knows how to shoot			2
the 20 - year - old was first to react after @entity53 was denied by the onrushing @entity55 goalkeeper and passed the ball into the net from outside the area with his left boot			1
the @entity58 international did well to control the ball and turn in the box to beat his defender but was unable to curl his shot on target			0
the defender looks to have hurt his shoulder and has been replaced by @entity66			0
@entity5 frontman @entity67 shield the ball from @entity55 defender @entity68 after claiming the second 45 minutes had n't really got going @entity5 score right on cue through 20 - year - old defender @entity24			1
@entity72 's @entity31 : in traditional pre-season fashion , @entity5 made a host of changes at half - time with only @entity7 and @entity77 surviving from the starting eleven			1
indeed such were the changes that @entity77 – captain for the night – found himself pushed in to the centre of defence so that @entity80 could persist with his three - man back line			0
not that any of this has done much to change the pattern of play			0
@entity5 are still dominating the play and scored their fourth goal on the hour when @entity25 crossed low from the left and young left - back @entity24 marked his debut with a goal from 12 yards			1
as is the case with many of these friendly matches when both sides make a host of changes at half - time			0
@entity72 's @entity97 : @entity99 and @entity100 were surprise guests at @entity5 ’s @entity103 training base on @entity104 , who has returned to live in @entity105 with his family after five - and - a - half years in @entity107 , is back in town for @entity5 ’s first game on their pre-season tour of the @entity111 against another of his former teams , @entity98 met up with new @entity5 boss @entity2 and some of the players and is expected to attend the @entity36 match at the @entity117 on @entity118 the above link to read the full story			1
great start to @entity2 's tenure at the club as the @entity38 lead 3 - 0 at the break			1
@entity72 's @entity31 : @entity125 has somehow managed to fall over when trying to clear a routine low cross from @entity15 which has allowed @entity18 to score his second , and @entity5 ’s third , from just six yards			1
half - time here in @entity107 and @entity5 ’s pre-season is up and running in some style			1
@entity72 's @entity31 : lots of love on social media tonight for @entity7 and @entity5 ’s new signing is having a nice game			1
it was @entity137 advancing from wing - back who won the penalty that has just given @entity5 their second goal , however			2
@entity142 worried @entity68 and when he went past him and crossed from the right the @entity55 player lifted his arm to concede a penalty			0
there were plenty of complaints from @entity55 players but it was a clear handball and @entity18 converted the penalty with his right foot			2
click the above link to read what @entity2 had to say during tuesday 's press conference			0
new boys @entity156 and @entity7 also made an appearance			0
@entity72 's @entity31 : @entity159 is playing for @entity55 tonight and he has looked to operate in the spaces in between @entity5 ’s back three			2
he has n’t really had much joy but he did get in behind @entity163 in the 30th minute , only for the @entity5 central defender to get a toe on the ball as @entity159 was about to shoot			0
@entity159 thought he was being held by his opponent and appealed for a penalty but from where i am sitting he was never going to get it			0
this really is a superb setting for a football match , by the way			0
the stadium is n’t quite full but there seems to be well over 60,000 in the ground			0
... and if the game ends in a draw then both clubs will share the trophy			0
very old school like with the @entity182			0
@entity55 left - back @entity68 ( what a great name ) marauds forward and lets fly from 25 yards out but @entity5 's @entity187 goalkeeper gets down to his right to deny the @entity190 international			1
it may only be a friendly but the @entity38 look lively			0
@entity7 has been particularly impressive with his neat , tidy passing			0
only fifteen minutes gone here at the @entity193 in beautiful @entity32 and already @entity5 have their first goal under @entity2			2
a bustling run from @entity67 saw the ball break 20 yards from goal and @entity15 swept it in off the post with a first time shot with his right foot			1
@entity5 had started brightly before that , @entity67 bringing a save from @entity55 goalkeeper @entity204 from a similar distance			2
interesting also here that @entity80 has sent @entity5 out to play with three central defenders , as he did with @entity208 in the @entity209			2
@entity67 lays the ball off to @entity15 who shoots from 20 yards out and sees his effort canon off the post and into the back of the net ! the first goal of the @entity80 era ! just two players who start tonight under @entity2 appeared in @entity219 ' first friendly as manager - @entity15 and @entity218			1
but the @entity39 's shot is tipped over the bar			0
@entity222 start from the £ 24million midfield man			0
@entity156 and @entity7 both starting with midfielder @entity77 preferred as captain over @entity18			2
@entity5 starting xi : @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity163 , @entity218 , @entity137 , @entity77 ( c ) , @entity7 , @entity156 , @entity67 , @entity15 , @entity18 .			1
