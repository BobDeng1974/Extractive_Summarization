wearing clothes made from cloth covered with tiny silver wires may reduce your heating bills in the future			1
this is because scientists have found that a new material made of cotton coated in silver nanowires , effectively traps heat inside a person ’s clothing , to keep the wearer cosy			1
the say it is also breathable and lightweight , making it comfortable to wear			2
scientists have found that a new material made of cotton coated in silver nanowires , effectively traps heat inside a person ’s clothing , to keep the wearer cosy			1
these images show the wires under the microscope at different magnifications , which because they are closely packed together , form a conductive network scientists from @entity29 in @entity30 developed the prototype material using silver because it reflects infrared radiation back towards the body , @entity27 reported			1
in order to make the metallic material comfortable to wear , they dipped cotton into a solution of silver nanowires that can sit on top of everyday clothing , according to the study published in @entity43			1
they created a fabric that ’s able to trap 80 per cent of body heat			1
the fabric is able to trap 80 per cent of body heat , because the tiny silver wires reflect infrared radiation back towards the body ( shown in a diagram on the left )			1
a piece of the new cloth was cut out in an 's ' shape and placed in the palm ( top right )			2
using heat - sensitive camera , the researchers showed it is able to block all uman - radiated @entity61 , keeping the heat inside so that the s - shape looks blue ( bottom right ) tiny antibacterial particles from silver are woven into the fabric of some socks to kill bacteria that makes them smell			2
the silver in the particles does n't kill bacteria by touching it , but instead produces soluble ions that reduce the pong			0
studies concluded that some of the particles come out in the wash , with some of them warning that when the toxic metal dissolves in water and releases silver ions , it can enter the food chain , poisoning small creatures			0
however , others have said silver nanoparticles do n't harm humans or the environment			0
research published in 2012 warned that bacteria may become resistant to silver if used in lots of everyday situations , which could have important implications , because the metal is used as an anti-bacterial in healthcare			0
silver is also rare and it 's estimated that global resources could run out in as little as 30 years			0
it is as efficient as a bulky fleece when worn like a normal piece of clothing , emitting infrared radiation emitted by a wearer , back to their body			1
but the clothes could be plugged into a computer , for example , to keep wearers even warmer			0
the idea is that a small amount of electricity could effectively turn a jacket into an electric blanket			1
extra heat can be generated by harnessing the movement of electricity across the fabric			0
and because the cloth is thin and breathable , it could one day replace bulky outdoor ski coats			0
the researchers say that the clothes could also be worn indoors to negate the need for heating			0
while it ’s easy to imagine that cloth made from silver may be expensive , the researchers claim the total cost of silver needed to make a complete body suit would only cost $ 1 ( 66p )			2
the researchers claim that wearing such clothes could save a person $ 200 a year in heating costs , or save enough energy to power 1,000 light bulbs for 10 hours			2
the cloth is not yet on sale and requires more testing , but the scientists are already working on another coating to keep clothes and their wearers cool in hot temperatures .			0

prototype cotton fabric is coated in silver nanowires to trap body heat
it 's as effective as a thick fleece , trapping 80 *%* of heat
material uses silver because it reflects infrared radiation back to the body
a small electric charge can be applied so it works like an electric blanket
experts from @entity29 say the cloth 's breathable and lightweight
it was developed to save energy produced by central heating
