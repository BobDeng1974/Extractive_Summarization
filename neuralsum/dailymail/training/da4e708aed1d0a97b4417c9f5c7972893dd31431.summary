@entity0 , 56 , has successfully overturned government restrictions on receiving books from friends and family in prison a convicted arsonist with a doctorate in @entity9 literature has successfully challenged government restrictions on receiving books in jail			1
a judge declared the rules introduced by justice secretary @entity15 in november last year as ' unlawful '			1
mr justice @entity17 ' decision was a victory for @entity0 , 56 , a convicted arsonist with a borderline personality disorder who has a degree and a doctorate in @entity9 literature			1
@entity23 , of @entity24 , near @entity25 , @entity26 , who also suffers from depression and epilepsy , is serving an indefinite sentence for torching homes and cars and slashing tyres			1
her victims were often elderly and vulnerable			0
she is being held at send prison near @entity36 , @entity37			0
she was denied legal aid but was able to bring her court challenge because lawyers represented her for free			0
under the current rules prisoners are prevented from receiving parcels unless they have ' exceptional circumstances ' , such as a medical condition			1
but @entity23 challenged the section of the new @entity47 ( @entity47 ) which she said ' imposes substantial restrictions on the ability of prisoners to receive , or have for their use , books '			1
the judge said the @entity47 amended the incentives and @entity56 ( @entity57 ) , which was brought in partly as an attempt to crack down on drugs getting into prisons			1
he said : ' i am satisfied that insofar as it includes books in @entity57 schemes , the @entity47 is unlawful			1
' a protest against the ruling , led by the poet laureate @entity66 ( centre ) was held outside @entity68 in north @entity69 in march - a court ruling has now successfully challenged the restrictions a judge declared the rules introduced by justice secretary @entity15 in november last year as ' unlawful ' the ruling was welcomed by solicitors firm @entity74 , who acted for @entity23 along with barristers @entity77 , @entity79 @entity78 and @entity80			1
the solicitors said in a statement : ' @entity83 is a right and not a privilege , to be encouraged and not restricted			0
' indeed , mr justice @entity17 commented that , as far as books are concerned , " to refer to them as a privilege is strange "			1
' the policy was unnecessary , irrational and counter-productive to rehabilitation			0
it is now rightly judged unlawful			2
' the solicitors said the justice secretary and prison governor ' sought to argue that there remained adequate access to books because prisoners borrow them from the prison library or purchase them with their own money , but this was rejected in today 's judgment '			2
they said : ' prison libraries are often inadequately stocked and there are restrictions on access			2
' spending caps for prisoners usually mean that there is enough for bare essentials but not for books			2
' referring to the fact that @entity23 was refused legal aid , the solicitors warned : ' under current proposals to restrict judicial review , it would be more difficult to bring this case and hold the government to account			0
' mr @entity17 told the @entity122 ( pictured ) : ' i see no good reason in the light of the importance of books for prisoners to restrict beyond what is required by volumetric control and reasonable measures relating to frequency of parcels and security considerations ' the rules have been opposed by arts ' figures including poet laureate @entity66 , actress @entity138 and author @entity139			1
a protest was held outside @entity68 in north @entity69 in march			0
@entity142 justice secretary @entity141 said : ' the ban on sending books to prisoners was always an absurd policy			2
' it had nothing to do with punishing and reforming prisoners but was an example of @entity152 's sloppy policy - making			2
' this is a victory for all those who campaigned against the ban and the government should abandon the ludicrous policy with immediate effect			0
' @entity159 , the former @entity160 mp jailed for six months for expenses fraud , described today 's judgment as ' a modest win for common sense '			0
he said he had a suitcase full of books confiscated when he was sent to @entity168 last @entity169			2
' @entity15 seems to think that being unpleasant to prisoners is good for society			1
on the contrary it makes rehabilitation much more difficult , ' he said			0
reacting to the decision , a @entity47 spokesman said : ' this is a surprising judgment			0
' there never was a specific ban on books and the restrictions on parcels have been in existence across most of the prison estate for many years and for very good reason			1
' prisoners have access to the same public library service as the rest of us , and can buy books through the prison shop			0
' we are considering how best to fulfil the ruling of the court			0
however , we are clear that we will not do anything that would create a new conduit for smuggling drugs and extremist materials in to our prisons			0
