they like @entity2 band @entity1 at @entity3			2
upon winning their 20th @entity5 title fans had the words of their song ' @entity7 ' made into a banner that takes pride of place at the @entity3			2
but in the case of forgotten man @entity15 and his triumphant return to the side , the @entity13 four - piece 's earlier hit ' @entity11 ' would be more appropriate			1
@entity15 ( centre ) is starting to make an impact for @entity22 's @entity21 side @entity15 has forged a strong bond with fellow @entity25 @entity24 , who scored twice against @entity26 what took you so long @entity22 ? why was @entity15 , suddenly a key player in @entity21 's new - found swagger , out of the picture for long chunks of the season ? there is more than one answer			1
firstly , if anyone is a ' club signing ' it is @entity15			2
long before the coronation of @entity39 , @entity21 originally vowed to ensure he would be their man following his mesmerising role in @entity42 victory over sir @entity44 's side			2
the admiration from within spread to the stands			0
they have never been shy of praising opponents at @entity3 – this was where , in 2003 , @entity51 famously secured a standing ovation after a beautiful @entity55 hat - trick for @entity56			2
the 25 - year - old was signed from @entity42 in a £ 28.8million move following @entity60 's arrival @entity15 made a bright start to his @entity21 career , but injury saw the @entity25 sidelined for several weeks in that frantic and ultimately fruitless first summer @entity64 famously made one attempt to capture @entity15 's services which ended in confusion after the complex hurdles within the player 's contract could not be overcome			1
but they would not give up			0
when @entity60 arrived talks were at an advanced stage with @entity15 's representatives and he was happy to give the £ 28.8m move the green light with the new season approaching			1
@entity21 have paid more for only four others , but as we have heard more than once , under @entity60 's philosophy the fee counts for nothing			1
former @entity21 boss @entity64 made an attempt to capture @entity15 's services , but failed the @entity85 midfielder is having to prove his worth to @entity60 during his first season at @entity3 @entity15 celebrates scoring during @entity21 's @entity88 fifth round victory against @entity90 in february not being the @entity92 's player , @entity15 may have had to prove himself more than most			1
in a stuttering start to the season , he was not seen for a month after being substituted at half - time against @entity96			0
as late as february he had completed 90 minutes just once since the 5 - 3 humbling at @entity97 in september			0
with their team struggling for rhythm @entity21 fans who remembered @entity15 conducting the tune for @entity42 , scratched their heads at his continued absence			1
when he made a rare start in the 3 - 1 @entity88 win at @entity106 on february 16 many put it down to @entity60 's squad rotation			1
@entity15 's partnership with @entity109 ( right ) has added tempo to what looked like a static midfield but @entity15 has started every game since , the kickstarting of his @entity3 career coinciding with @entity21 finally clicking into gear			1
his partnership with @entity109 has added tempo to what looked like a static midfield			0
suddenly @entity21 appear as sharp as their 1980s shirt sponsors			0
@entity15 's through ball for @entity24 to open the scoring against @entity26 came in a dominant half of football @entity21 fans wondered if they would ever see again only weeks ago			1
but there is more to it than @entity15 simply not being the boss 's signing			2
in a wide - ranging interview with @entity132 , he offered more clues			0
@entity15 and @entity24 chase down @entity134 during @entity21 's 2 - 1 victory against @entity26 on sunday @entity24 puts the ball past @entity137 for his firs goal following a brilliant throughball from @entity15 ' @entity60 loves possession and does n't like to risk [ losing ] the ball , ' he said			1
' he wants long possessions and to keep the ball because he believes you create spaces staying in the right place , because the team have the quality to find you			0
' at the beginning he used to tell me off because i always looked for the ball , i wanted to have it , and i must wait for it			0
' @entity60 is on the record stating his belief that his players must not play off the cuff – that they should know their jobs and if they do them his side will win			0
@entity160 ( left ) congratulates @entity15 on the part he played in @entity24 's opening goal it is a pragmatic cross-sports philosophy used in the @entity164 by @entity166 head coach @entity165 , whose team this year won their fourth @entity168 this century			1
while it does not sound like the famous @entity170 , it certainly looked like it at @entity172			0
@entity15 , superb on @entity173 , believes that if it had not been for football he would have tried a career in sports journalism			0
by the looks of things , he has plenty of new chapters to write at @entity3 first .			0

@entity15 signed for @entity21 in £ *29m* deal last summer
@entity25 has struggled to make an impact at @entity3
@entity22 has seemed *reluctant* to use the 25 - year - old
@entity15 's has played his way into @entity60 's starting xi
