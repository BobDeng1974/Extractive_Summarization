by @entity0 published : 21:08 est , 17 november 2012 updated : 09:36 est , 18 november 2012 it was intended as a 17th birthday celebration for his twin sons at the family ’s holiday villa in southern @entity7			1
but @entity9 ’s dream of a two - week break in @entity11 , with its labyrinth of pretty cobbled streets and spectacular views , ended in tragedy			1
attacked by a mob of 30 men as he left a local bar with his sons , he died after spending 12 days in hospital in a coma			1
@entity9 ( right ) had dreamed of a two - week break in @entity11 with his children @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26			1
but , it ended in tragedy when he was attacked by a mob of men now three - and - a - half years later , the businessman ’s body is still preserved in a @entity34 mortuary , while his devastated family wait for the @entity7 courts to bring his killers to justice			1
charges of manslaughter were brought 16 months ago but no trial date is yet set and mr @entity9 , originally from @entity42 , must remain , according to @entity7 law , where he is until the case is over			1
but the delay has taken its toll on his grieving family , who have decided to speak of their ordeal for the first time in the hope a trial will take place soon , allowing them to finally find closure			1
last night , mr @entity9 ’s daughter @entity24 , 23 , a @entity56 student , told @entity57 : ‘ our family has been destroyed by what happened to dad			1
he was a decent , honest man who loved his family			2
it ’s hard for us to accept he ’s gone			2
it ’s like a nightmare we never wake up from			0
’ the family believe the killing was fuelled by @entity68 towards the expatriate community and are concerned for @entity34 families still visiting the area , oblivious to on - going ill - feeling			1
she added : ‘ @entity72 was attacked by men with knuckle dusters , bottles and metal bars intent on inflicting harm			0
we could n’t bear for this to happen to another family			2
’ miss @entity80 , who was at the family ’s house in @entity83 , @entity84 , with her mother , @entity85 , 45 , when the attack happened , has had to rely on eye - witness accounts to piece together the moments before the assault			1
mr @entity9 and his sons , @entity26 and @entity25 , were attacked after leaving @entity92 pub , in @entity11 , a village the family liked for its quiet location away from the busy @entity95 resorts an hour away			1
an altercation in the pub beforehand , between a local youth and another @entity34 man , led to the bar owner closing the premises			1
@entity80 said : ' our family has been destroyed by what happened to @entity72			1
' she told of how he was attacked by men with knuckle dusters , bottles and metal bars intent on inflicting harm her brothers , now 20 and promising boxers who hope to compete in the @entity109 in @entity42 in 2014 , were unable to help their father when the mob struck			0
mr @entity9 , wounded by a bottle to his head , was forced over a balcony , sustaining horrific injuries as he landed on concrete 25ft below			1
miss @entity80 said : ‘ the mayor has tried to play down @entity68 for fear it will affect tourism but we believe there is no other explanation			1
‘ lies were spread that one of my brothers looked the wrong way at a local girl and that ’s what started the fight			2
but my brothers were quite shy and unlikely to do that			0
‘ my dad had n’t even been drinking – the post mortem showed no alcohol			0
they were just out for a nice meal and got dragged into this nightmare			0
’ the family are also angry about ‘ insensitive ’ treatment from police and medical staff			2
miss @entity80 and her mother flew to @entity143 after a phone call from the twins			0
they found mr @entity9 , who suffered a brain haemorrhage , in intensive care in the city ’s @entity149			1
‘ @entity25 and @entity26 , their clothes covered in blood , one with a broken nose and the other a fractured right hand , had n’t been allowed to see dad and had been left to sit outside on the grass all night waiting for news , ’ said miss @entity80			2
‘ inside the hospital , we were desperate to know what was happening but there was no compassion			0
no one seemed to want to do anything to help us			0
maybe they assumed my dad and brothers had caused the fight but it set the tone for the next 12 days			2
’ she also learned there appeared no sense of urgency in getting her father to hospital for the one hour journey to @entity143 , despite his terrible injuries , and when paramedics eventually turned up in an ambulance , according to eye witnesses at the scene , they seemed more intent on texting on their mobile phones than rushing to mr @entity9 ’s side			1
at police headquarters , the family were interrogated and the twins made to wait in cells before questioning			2
miss @entity80 said : ‘ a bag with my dad ’s blood - covered clothes was handed to my shocked mum			2
we refused to take it , saying the clothes might contain dna evidence and they should be examined			0
@entity201 later identified a number of people			0
we thought it was unbelievable incompetence on their part			0
’ days later , the family were told mr @entity9 would not recover and three doctors had decided to switch off his life support machine			1
‘ we were given an hour to say goodbye , ’ added miss @entity80			0
‘ i remember afterwards seeing two orderlies pushing my dad , his face covered , along the corridor , whistling as they passed by us			0
@entity213 and i were crying yet they did n’t seem to notice			0
the memory never leaves me			0
’ it was six months before he was repatriated and the family told he must be preserved in case of another post mortem			2
she said : ‘ the @entity83 coroner gave dad a place in the mortuary but we never imagined he would still be there three years on			2
’ the @entity228 has learned a number of youths were arrested by police after the june 6 , 2009 , incident and questioned before being handed over to investigating magistrate , @entity233 , at a court in nearby @entity235 , to decide who should face charges			0
sworn statements were taken from suspects , scenes - of - crime officers , paramedics and mr @entity9 ’s sons in court hearings closed to the press and public			1
the magistrate has now finished her task and , in an indictment , has formally accused five @entity7 with manslaughter and another 12 with wounding and affray			1
they are all aged between 18 and 25			0
it is understood delays have been caused by a ‘ minor ’ administrative error , resulting in the indictment being returned to the @entity235 court to be corrected and resent			0
now prosecutors and defence lawyers will formally submit their reports on behalf of their clients to @entity143 ’s @entity259 and a trial is expected to be held in six months			0
a court source said : ‘ prosecutors will outline the sentences and punishments they are asking for and their version of what happened the night of mr @entity9 's death and the defence lawyers will do the same			1
that has n’t happened yet because of the large number of accused but the court hopes to be ready for trial in at least six months			2
’ but miss @entity80 , who has since learned to speak fluent @entity7 in order to understand everything at the trial , is sceptical about the date			1
she said : ‘ they keep saying six months , one month , two months …			0
i hope for everyone ’s sake it is finally going to happen			0
’ it is only through counselling from @entity281 charity petal – people @entity283 - that @entity284 can finally talk about what her family have been through			1
the marine biology student , who developed post-traumatic stress following her father ’s death and has struggled to cope with her university studies at times as a result , said : ‘ it is like a form of torture and there is still no end in sight			0
how can we ever move on without being able to say goodbye or any sense of closure ? ’ she added : ‘ we were a really close little family before this happened			1
now we are all just functioning and frozen in time			0
’ sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
