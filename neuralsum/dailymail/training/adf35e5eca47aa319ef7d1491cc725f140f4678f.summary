towering 4,478m above the pretty town of @entity2 below , the @entity0 is a formidable challenge for any mountaineer			1
so spare a thought for @entity6 , 44 , from @entity7 , who not only scaled the mighty peak but , incredibly , did so 15 years after losing his hands and feet to frostbite during a mountaineering accident			1
now mr @entity6 says he hopes his feat will prove an inspiration to others struggling with disabilities - as well as those who fight shy of challenges			1
' when i see a failure , all i can think about is how to overcome it			0
' mr @entity6 's story began 15 years ago , when he and his friend @entity28 were trapped half way up a mountain by a storm			1
mr @entity28 and mr @entity6 had climbed the north face of @entity33 in the @entity35 massif but found themselves beset by deep snow and winds of up to 90mph			1
so bad were conditions , the pair were marooned on @entity33 for four days and nights ; a length of time that proved too much for mr @entity28 who died of hypothermia on the last night			2
formidable : the @entity0 , seen here from the banks of @entity47 , has claimed the lives of 500 climbers stunning : despite its beauty , the @entity0 is one of the hardest peaks to climb anywhere in @entity54 ready to climb : mr @entity6 in a photograph taken ahead of his attempt in august 2013 although rescuers eventually managed to come to mr @entity6 's aid , his hands and feet had been so badly affected by frostbite , he was forced to have them amputated			1
but incredibly , just a few years later , mr @entity6 was back on the mountainside			1
' it took a while before i started getting back into the idea of wanting to climb again but it was always such a passion , ' he explains			0
' i knew that flame had n't been extinguished			0
i also knew that if @entity6 had survived he 'd be doing the same thing			2
to me , it 's always been such an enriching experience			0
' a visit to the @entity72 and to the spot where mr @entity28 lost his life proved cathartic and it was n't long before mr @entity6 began climbing again - starting with a small @entity7 hill			1
' it was quite poignant going back and seeing our old haunts and the mountains again , ' he says of his trip back to the @entity72			0
' it was just the same , even though i 'd had this huge experience ; it was all the same			0
i knew then , that it was n't the mountains that were to blame and it helped me to come to terms with what happened			0
' i just started to take it one step at a time , i did n't think about mountains to begin with ; it was just about climbing up a hill in @entity7			2
' even that was hard to begin with but it was about getting stronger , fitter , improving my balance through practice , finding new ways around the difficulty			0
he adds : ' it was a big learning curve but every step was really rewarding			0
every new thing i learned , every peak , however small , was a victory and a rewarding experience			2
' but while climbing the peaks of @entity105 is no easy task , even the lofty heights of the 1,344m @entity109 pale beside the @entity0 - a peak so dangerous that an estimated 500 climbers have died on it since the first attempt in 1865			1
tough : scaling the @entity0 required hours of training and specially adapted prosthetic limbs intimidating : during training for his epic challenge , mr @entity6 hiked up peaks in the @entity72 and @entity119 ' it 's a famous peak , it 's iconic , ' says mr @entity6 of his decision to attempt the formidable mountain			1
' it 's that classic chocolate box pyramid and even from a mountaineering perspective its difficult , even today			2
' compared to most mountains in @entity129 , it 's difficult and i 'd never climbed it even before my accident , so it was an obvious challenge			2
but it took a long time for that to be possible			0
' making it possible included hours of training and having his prosthetic limbs adapted to cope with the rigours of the climb as well as the @entity0 's quirks , which include sheer cliff - faces and paths strewn with slippery stones			2
' physically , it 's such a big mountain , ' adds mr @entity148			2
' the climb is 1400m - that 's just exhausting and it 's tricky the whole way			0
' you have to concentrate the whole way because one stip could be disastrous			0
finding new ways of using my prosthetics was key			0
' despite the challenge facing him and the agonising muscle pain that he endured on the way up , mr @entity6 says that the experience was a wonderful one			1
incredible : @entity6 and his climbing partner @entity164 during their ascent of the @entity0 next : mr @entity6 hopes to scale @entity167 ; a 2,308m escarpment in @entity170 's @entity169 inspiring : mr @entity6 has trained himself to find ways around every obstacle in his path ' when you 're up there and heading for summit or on the way down , it 's hard to appreciate your surroundings because you 're focused and your thoughts are about getting job done , ' he explains			1
' it was only afterwards that i began to look back and appreciate the experience			0
when you 're up there , there 's this incredible panoramic view and you 've earned it			2
you 've earned every inch that you 've gained and that is a terrific feeling			0
' although his wife @entity190 had been worried about his safety , mr @entity6 says she and his friends supported him every step of the way and he hopes that they 'll do the same for his next challenge - scaling @entity167 , a 2,308m sheer rocky outcrop in @entity170 's @entity169			1
' for that kind of climbing you use a lot more equipment , ' he explains			0
' it 's just a case of planning it and getting round the obstacles , although it 's not to be taken lightly			0
' when mr @entity6 is n't conquering peaks that would strike fear into the hearts of the able - bodied - let alone those missing limbs - he spends his time mentoring people who 've lost their hands or feet and are trying to come to terms with their new lives			1
' there 's not many people who lose their hands and feet but when they are , i go and visit , and while i would never tell anyone how to live their lives , i do tell them that whatever you 're trying to achieve in life , if you give it a go , then you really can do it			1
' people can do great things if they get their mindset right			0
' see mr @entity6 's incredible feat in @entity230 , now available to watch on @entity231			1
