click here to view our brilliant @entity2 service , including the move that led to @entity6 's hat - trick goal with @entity8 the player in @entity10 shame , @entity8 the manager took his cue to leave			1
@entity13 ’s coach had only a remote chance of progression going into last night ’s final @entity17 fixture and saw those prospects chewed up within six minutes by a man who might soon play for @entity20			2
@entity6 did the damage , producing the kind of wonderful attacking performance that is becoming rather common at this extraordinary @entity10			2
hot shot : @entity25 's @entity6 lets fly from just outside the box error of judgment : @entity13 goalkeeper @entity29 fail to stop @entity6 's strike kiss me quick : @entity6 ( r ) of celebrates his early strike for @entity25 with cameraman @entity34 leads @entity35 into last 16 @entity13 : @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 ( @entity42 77 ) , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 ( @entity46 46 ) , @entity47 , @entity48 ( @entity49 40 )			1

@entity20 are understood to have opened preliminary talks with @entity88 over a £ 16million move for the midfielder and he illustrated the hype with two excellent first - half goals and a third after the break			1
with @entity25 through to the second round , that value might yet rise			2
@entity6 ’s first goal , after six minutes , was quite brilliant			0
@entity40 had given @entity6 too much time and space to turn on the edge of the @entity13 area , but only so much blame can be apportioned to defenders when a ball is curled into the top corner from 20 yards			1
@entity6 's second perhaps relied more on @entity13 ’s deficiencies , but the finish was only marginally less impressive			1
@entity38 made a hash of cutting out a throughball , enabling @entity110 to take possession on the left before squaring for @entity6 , who took two touches and sent @entity29 the wrong way			0
great composure , lovely finish			0
@entity13 had chances of their own , most notably in the second half when @entity25 became complacent			0
clinical : @entity6 coolly slots the ball past @entity13 keeper @entity29 for his second goal treble time : @entity6 completes his hat - trick against @entity13 goal - den boy : @entity6 claims the match ball after scoring a hat - trick @entity127 : @entity25 after 51 minutes @entity128 beat goalkeeper @entity60 and had his shot cleared off the line by @entity64			1
they were then denied what looked like a solid shout for a penalty 10 minutes later when @entity49 was bundled over by @entity62			0
just as @entity13 appeared to have a foothold , @entity6 finished from close range for his third			0
well done : @entity6 is embraced by @entity25 coach @entity138 delight : @entity25 players celebrate beating @entity13 and reaching the last 16 frustrated : @entity13 coach @entity141 on the touchline			1

@entity6 opened the scoring with 20 - yard strike
@entity88 ace added second with clinical finish
@entity6 completed his hat - trick in the 71st minute
@entity25 *pipped* @entity152 to second place in @entity17
@entity25 will now face @entity86 in the last 16
