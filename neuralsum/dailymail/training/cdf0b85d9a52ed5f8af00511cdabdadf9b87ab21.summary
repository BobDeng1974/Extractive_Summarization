it can be difficult to grasp just how vast the universe and its planets and stars are - especially in relation to @entity5			0
but now one amateur astronomer has attempted to reveal the scale of objects in our galaxy by overlaying @entity5 ’s continents , and our world itself , on celestial objects			1
one image reveals how @entity5 would fit across the width of @entity18 ’s rings six times over , while @entity20 ’ @entity19 is also shown to be the same size as the state of @entity23			1
the pictures were created by @entity26 - based amateur astronomer @entity25 and show @entity5 ’s size relative to the sun , @entity18 , @entity20 and @entity29			1
in his first image , he shows how a neutron star ’s size compares to the north west of @entity34 , between @entity35 and @entity36 ( shown ) the pictures were created by @entity26 - based amateur astronomer @entity25 ‘ the vast majority of objects out there in the universe are pretty big so it can be difficult sometimes to get your head round their actual size , ’ explained mr @entity25 on website @entity38			1
‘ here you ’ll see how some space stuff out there compares to @entity5 stuff down here			0
’ in his first image , he shows how a neutron star ’s size compares to the north west of @entity34 , between @entity35 and @entity36			1
neutron star : 12 miles ( 20km ) @entity19 : 374 miles ( 624km ) @entity29 ’s moon @entity55 : 1,942 miles ( 3,636km ) @entity20 : 4,220 miles ( 6,792km ) @entity5 : 7,918 miles ( 12,742km ) @entity18 : 72,367 miles ( 116,464km ) @entity29 : 88,846 miles ( 142,984km ) @entity18 ’s rings : 175,000 miles ( 282,000km ) the @entity58 : 864,950 miles ( 1,392,000km ) but mr @entity25 added that a neutron star , such as the one pictured , is 1.5 times the mass of the sun despite its relatively small size			1
‘ so dense in fact that just a teaspoon of it would weigh over a billion tonnes , ’ continued mr @entity25			0
another image , this time of @entity67 , shows how the @entity20 volcano @entity19 would obscure the state of @entity23			1
located in the @entity71 region of @entity20 , @entity19 is the biggest volcano in the solar system			0
it is taller than three @entity75 ’s above sea level and is 374 miles ( 624 km ) across			0
@entity29 ’s moon @entity55 , meanwhile , would cover almost the entirety of @entity67			2
‘ looking like a cheese pizza ’ according to mr @entity25 it would fit snugly between @entity80 and @entity81			0
this illustration shows how the @entity20 volcano @entity19 would obscure the state of @entity23			1
located in the @entity71 region of @entity20 , @entity19 is the biggest volcano in the solar system @entity29 ’s moon @entity55 , meanwhile , would cover almost the entirety of @entity67			1
‘ looking like a cheese pizza ’ according to mr @entity25 it would fit snugly between @entity80 and @entity81 @entity55 is the first of @entity29 ’s four main @entity89 moons and for this reason it is pushed and pulled by the planet ’s intense gravity			1
this has made it the most volcanically active place in the solar system , including @entity5 , with hundreds of volcanoes known to be active on its surface			0
mr @entity25 then shows how @entity20 , which is about half the size of our planet , would comfortably cover the whole of @entity67 with plenty of room to spare			1
but in comparison to @entity107 would be dwarfed by a create margin ; the continent appears as just a speck on the vast cloud bands of the gas giant			0
mr @entity25 then shows how @entity20 , which is about half the size of our planet , would comfortably cover the whole of @entity67 with plenty of room to spare but in comparison to @entity107 would be dwarfed by a great margin ; the continent appears as just a speck on the vast cloud bands of the gas giant in fact our planet ’s diameter is 11 times smaller than the gas giant , which has lightning bolts 1,000 times more powerful than those on our own			1
zooming further our , mr @entity25 then compares @entity5 to @entity18			2
our planet would fit six times over into the width of the rings , which span a whopping 175,000 miles ( 282,000km ) wide			2
and if our planet took the position of @entity18 , the our planet sit in the middle 41,600 miles ( 66,900km ) away from the rings			0
zooming further our , mr @entity25 then compares @entity5 to @entity18			2
our planet would fit six times over into the width of the rings , which span a whopping 175,000 miles ( 282,000km ) wide and if our planet took the position of @entity18 , we would sit in the middle 41,600 miles ( 66,900km ) away from the inner edge of the rings , which then extend much further into space compared to the @entity58 , our planet appears even smaller			1
‘ at the @entity58 ’s scale , @entity5 is now really starting to look puny , ’ explains mr @entity25			2
‘ across the @entity58 ’s disk you could fit 109 @entity141 , and to fill the @entity58 ’s volume would take 1,300,000 earths			0
’ he continues : ‘ @entity58 puts out more energy in one second than has ever been produced in all of human history , and loses four billion tonnes of material into space every second but has enough to last for another five billion years			0
‘ a solar flare , an explosion from the @entity58 ’s surface caused when hugely powerful magnetic fields break apart under stress , can have the power of a billion @entity154 bombs			0
’ all the images serve to show just how our planet compares to other objects in space			0
compared to the @entity58 , our planet is even more dwarfed			0

pictures were created by @entity26 - based amateur astronomer @entity25
they show @entity5 ’s size relative to the sun , @entity18 , @entity20 and @entity29
in one image , @entity67 is shown how it would look on the red planet
another reveals how tiny @entity5 is when placed next to the sun
@entity5 would fit across the width of @entity18 ’s rings six times
while @entity20 ’ @entity19 would cover the state of @entity23
