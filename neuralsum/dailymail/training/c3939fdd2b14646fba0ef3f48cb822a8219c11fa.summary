but it was n't enough for her and under pressure to slim for a holiday , the sensitive teenager 's body worries spiralled out of control			1
a battle with anorexia blighted her life for the next eight years and at one point the damaged girl weighed a terrifying 4st 7lb			1
but 10 years on , @entity2 , who hails from @entity18 in @entity19 , is healthy and happy again , and puts the turnaround down to her ' miracle ' daughter , two - year - old @entity21			1
happy and healthy : a now recovered @entity2 credits her two - year - old daughter @entity21 with saving her life trigger : @entity2 on the @entity25 holiday that kickstarted her descent into eight years of anorexic hell ' i feel so lucky to be alive and to have such a beautiful little girl , ' the mother - of - one told the @entity31			1
' i 've lost friends to this illness [ anorexia ] and while i know i 'll never be free of those anorexic feelings , i only have to look at @entity36 and i feel strong			2
she helped me more than any doctor could			0
' at her lowest point @entity2 's weight plummeted to just 4st 7lb while she eked out an existence on a single apple and 150 laxatives a day			1
even when warned by a doctor that she was ruining her health and could die , she still could n't see sense and had to be referred to an eating disorders unit			2
she admits that she did n't listen to the doctors because all she cared about was being skinny			2
she had always wanted to to be a mother but the thought of getting pregnant and putting on weight was terrifying			1
it was n't until she realised that her friends and family truly thought she would n't survive that she started to pull back from the brink			0
recovery : @entity2 thought that her illness could have left her infertile and was thrilled to find she was pregnant transformation : @entity2 today ( right ) is a far cry from the skinny figure she cut while at her sickest spurred on by friends and her worried parents , she slowly put on weight , eventually tipping the scales at a healthy 8st			1

' but @entity67 made me more accepting of my body			0
we were so happy and moved in together			0
the only thing missing was a baby			0
' but @entity2 feared that having a child might never be a possibility for her , thanks to the damage caused by years of living with an eating disorder			1
' i 'd been taking 150 laxatives a day at one point , ' she adds			0
' it was obvious that my body could n't cope with a baby			0
' happily , fate had a wonderful surprise in store and just months later , @entity2 discovered that she was pregnant			1
but her old fears still plagued her , and she admits that she was terrified of putting on weight			0
she still made herself sick on some days but with @entity67 supporting her every step of the way @entity2 managed to take control of her demons and by the time daughter @entity21 was born , @entity2 weighed a normal 11st 7lbs			1
suddenly @entity21 was her priority , rather then her body , as she focused on being a good mother			0
