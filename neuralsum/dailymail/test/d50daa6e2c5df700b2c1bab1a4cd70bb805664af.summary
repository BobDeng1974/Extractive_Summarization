when you ’re in good touch , it just takes a moment			2
@entity4 had only been on the pitch for six minutes when he made the decisive intervention in this tightly - fought encounter , but what a crucial one it could prove to be			2
@entity10 , with sharp eyes and precise feet , played @entity4 in down the right touchline , the ball hugging the white line as it went forward			2
@entity4 ’s natural acceleration saw him spectacularly outpace @entity15 and his low cross was fired high into the net by @entity18 at the back post			1
@entity18 celebrates after firing home a second - half winner at the @entity22 the @entity24 goalscorer showed his delight after scoring what turned out to be the winning goal @entity24 striker @entity28 is brought down by @entity30 captain @entity29 during the clash @entity30 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity32 ; @entity33 , @entity29 , @entity34 , @entity15 ; @entity35 ( @entity36 79 ) , @entity37 , @entity38 ; @entity39 ( @entity40 71 ) , @entity41 ( best 79 ) , @entity42 subs not used : @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 booked : @entity29 , @entity37 goal : @entity18 62 @entity24 ( 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 ) : @entity49 ; @entity10 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 ; @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity18 ; @entity56 ( @entity4 56 ) ; @entity28 ( @entity57 88 ) subs not used : @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity64 - @entity63 booked : @entity10 , @entity57 referee : @entity66 ( @entity67 ) attendance : 28,890 ( 3,214 away ) from start to finish , the move took about 10 seconds			1
@entity24 were inferior for pretty much the rest of the contest but needed only this flash of inspiration to keep their @entity76 promotion hopes on course			1
it just takes a moment			0
it took @entity81 ’s record as manager to 11 wins from 16 - a magnificent return - and has them breathing down the necks of @entity87 and @entity88 , who occupy those coveted automatic spots			0
down and out of the race at the @entity93 , they are now fancied by many			0
the manner of the defeat would have frustrated @entity97 , desperate to get one over on his former employers			0
but in the end , even he would appreciate the ruthless smash and grab nature of @entity24 ’s win here			1
@entity97 insisted in advance of the game that he bore no animosity to his former employers , who dumped him in april 2014 as the club sat 17th and safe in the @entity76			0
they were n’t able to maintain that position and were relegated but under the masterful guidance of @entity81 have mounted an impressive late charge for an immediate return to the big time			2
the @entity24 travelled down to the south coast having lost just once in their last dozen games and eight wins within that sequence had them anchored in the play - offs , with reasonable hope of more			1
and in persistent drizzle at the @entity121 , they made the brighter opening			0
@entity53 touched a free - kick short to @entity18 who , off a fast bowler ’s run - up , leathered a rocket shot that @entity32 had to turn around the post			1
if @entity24 do gain promotion , @entity28 will have been one of the main reasons with his 19 goals and his awareness teed up @entity56 , whose shot was blocked by @entity32 at his near post			1
@entity28 gesticulates during the @entity135 encounter at the @entity22 on @entity136 @entity24 midfielder @entity53 shows his anger at a decision by shouting at the linesman and @entity28 was a stud ’s length away from turning home @entity52 ’s wicked left - wing cross just before the half - hour mark			1
@entity30 , down in 16th , have little to play for but pride in the remaining weeks of the season but they seized control of the game as the first - half drew on			1
@entity37 and @entity35 gained a stranglehold on the midfield , while @entity152 loanee @entity42 was often too hot for the @entity24 defence to handle			1
he was wayward , however , when @entity35 seized upon a weak pass from @entity51 , roamed unchallenged into the area and set him up in a good shooting - position			2
@entity42 dragged his effort wide of the post , to @entity51 ’s great relief			0
but the skilful @entity160 was soon back in the action , waltzing into the area and firing off a firm low shot that @entity49 palmed back out			0
@entity164 was lurking but @entity24 captain @entity50 cleared			1
@entity18 shoots at @entity30 goalkeeper @entity32 's during his side 's 1 - 0 win against @entity30 in stoppage time , it was the turn of @entity55 to be hesitant at the back , clearing in too much of a hurry and inviting @entity42 to run it back			1
@entity49 blocked with his legs at the near post			0
in the away technical area , @entity81 cut an irritated figure			0
he stomped around restlessly , throwing up his arms and cursing every time a move broke down			2
his half - time team talk was no doubt voluble			0
it took a while to sink in but the result was spectacular when it did as @entity18 made the difference			1
‘ going up , up , up ’ chanted the 3,000 - plus from @entity183 and for the only time all afternoon , @entity81 permitted himself a smile			0
@entity97 rolled the dice , introducing @entity40 first then @entity186 and @entity187			0
slowly , they started to create more and @entity49 bravely intervened to reach @entity40 ’s drilled cross in front of @entity36			0
but the late siege did n’t come and @entity24 go rolling on			2
@entity24 's @entity56 ( left ) battles for possession with @entity15 ( right ) of @entity30			1

@entity24 move up to third spot with away *victory* against @entity30
