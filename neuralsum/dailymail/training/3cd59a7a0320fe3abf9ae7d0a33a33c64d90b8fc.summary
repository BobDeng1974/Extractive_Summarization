with a manager as combustible and as clever as @entity2 , you always know that he is going to blow at some stage of the season			1
by highlighting @entity6 ’s performance at @entity7 , where the referee gave @entity9 a yellow card for diving , @entity2 created some hysteria			1
that was a carefully orchestrated move by @entity2 , delivering the same message in each of his post-match press conferences with equal conviction			1
@entity2 's comments about referee @entity6 were a calculated move designed to heap pressure on officials in the all - important @entity23 title run - in , possibly to @entity25 's benefit @entity2 criticised @entity6 after @entity9 was booked for diving during @entity25 draw at @entity7 @entity9 was infuriated by @entity6 's decision , believing he was fouled and deserved a penalty at face value it looked like he was trying to attack pundits , experts and analysts			1
by turning his fire on them , and away from the referee , he avoided an @entity38 charge			2
but his real target was referees			2
the title race could be decided by a referee ’s decision and @entity2 wants to influence them			1
at @entity46 on @entity47 , @entity45 is on notice and will be well aware that @entity25 have not been awarded a penalty away from @entity50 this season			1
that is an incredible statistic			0
@entity45 is one of the most volatile referees in the @entity23			2
whenever he booked me he would flash the card so quickly that it felt he was about to punch me			2
@entity45 treats players like little boys and can inflame and aggravate situations			0
he really used to wind me up			0
this is a big test for him , a big night at @entity46 for @entity62 , and it comes just a few weeks after @entity65 ’s team lost 3 - 0 at @entity50			0
speaking on @entity66 , @entity2 claimed that officials have a ' campaign ' against @entity25 the @entity25 boss clearly feels that decisions have gone against his team at key moments this season @entity9 reacts with incredulity after being booked for simulation after going down in the area @entity25 currently have a three - point advantage at the top of the @entity23 @entity45 ’s last @entity25 match was their 1 - 1 draw at @entity80			1
he sent off @entity81 in the 90th minute and @entity82 equalised 45 seconds later			0
if there are any tricky decisions to be made tonight , @entity45 might have @entity2 ’s comments ringing in his ears			1
@entity2 is a brilliant team builder			1
he quickly identifies areas he needs to improve and creates a cause like no other manager in the @entity23			0
it can work as a real positive energy			0
he is a trophy hunter and there is a lot of silverware to be won before he is done with @entity98 football			0
but his team , for all their quality , are stuttering on their travels after losing at @entity103 and drawing at @entity104 and @entity7			1
it is easy to criticise a referee , to distract people from a performance , but i believe his recent comments were deliberate because he showed restraint			1
he did just enough to create headlines and debate — and to get inside the heads of referees			2
@entity2 is a master manipulator , using situations to his advantage , and he knows the pressure is on @entity25 in the second half of the season			1
@entity122 are lurking in striking distance			1
at some stage his dressing room will feel tension because they are leading from the front and are expected to win their first @entity23 title since he returned to @entity25			1
boot room preview for @entity62 vs @entity25 on @entity47 @entity2 was left furious after @entity81 was sent off in the late stages at @entity80 @entity82 scored @entity133 's equaliser seconds after @entity81 was sent off at @entity80 at @entity135 we had all sorts of little psychological ploys to gain an advantage before kick - off			1
@entity2 works the same way			1
we would never come out of the dressing room at @entity142 until the opposition were waiting for us in the tunnel			0
we are @entity135 , we decide when we come out			0
in matches against @entity133 i would deliberately shield the officials as they came off the pitch at half - time so that sir @entity150 could not get to them			0
in games of this magnitude , you will seize upon any little advantage			0
@entity2 must keep his players onside , convince them that they are the best team as they enter this crucial second half of the season			1
they have had four yellow cards for simulation this season and there is a reason for that — our eyes are not deceiving us			0
clearly , though , @entity2 wants to create an ‘ us against the world ’ mentality			2
@entity172 kept @entity25 on track with his equalising goal at @entity7 on sunday @entity9 is brought down by @entity7 's @entity175 in the incident that started the debate @entity2 goes mad on the touchline after @entity25 appeals for a penalty are waved away that attitude can really bond a group because if you feel you are hard done by , you are even more determined to play well			1
the other , more subtle impact is on referees			2
there is no doubt @entity2 makes comments like these to increase the pressure on officials			1
still , complaining in such exaggerated terms about @entity25 being victimised does not cast him in a good light			2
his team are top of the @entity23 and playing some of the best football ever seen at @entity50			0
he does n’t need to complain , just win matches			0
no - one wants to see a whingeing manager win trophies and as brilliant as @entity2 is — he ’s one of the best — he might want to keep a lid on what he is saying			2
when he came back to @entity50 he talked about staying a long time			0
to do that he needs to make friends , not enemies			0
just when we were starting to like him again he overstepped the mark at @entity7			2
he has self - destructed at previous clubs and had to leave			0
he ca n’t afford to do the same again			0
there is n’t a campaign or witch - hunt against @entity25 but @entity2 has stepped up the pressure on match officials at a crucial stage of the season			1
tonight it will be fascinating to see how @entity45 handles it .			0

@entity2 alleged a campaign by referees against @entity25 this week
it came after @entity9 was booked for diving at @entity7
referee @entity6 later said sorry to @entity2 for not giving penalty
but @entity2 's comments are a carefully orchestrated move
the @entity229 is making a deliberate effort to influence referees
he knows title race with @entity122 could come down to decision
