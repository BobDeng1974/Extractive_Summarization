but home secretary @entity10 made clear she believes anyone who kills a police officer belongs ' behind bars for life '			2
mps warned that the public will be ' absolutely furious ' about the decision to release the ' evil ' killer			1
deputy prime minister @entity4 today refused to condemn the decision to release @entity3 from jail , despite a public outcry 48 years after he killed three police officers mr @entity4 today repeatedly refused to condemn the decision by the parole board to allow the 78 - year - old to walk free , despite a judge during his trial for murdering three officers insisting he should die behind bars			1
he suggested that as home secretary mrs may has the power to intervene but has chosen not to			0
but in a statement issued this afternoon , mrs may insisted : ' policemen and women go out to work every day knowing that they might face great danger and they carry out their duties with great courage			0
' i strongly believe that anyone who murders a police officer belongs behind bars – and behind bars for life			2
that is why i have made sure the government will change the law so life will mean life for anyone who murders a police officer			2
under pressure during his weekly radio phone - in , mr @entity4 conceded the case would provoke ' controversy ' but defended the justice system which allows @entity6 's to take the decision			1
he told @entity58 : ' it 's not about my feelings			2
it 's not about my feelings			2
it 's about how the justice system , works and if you want to run our justice system according to whatever the latest emotion you feel , fine			1
' but that would be an absolute disaster for the kind of principles of justice i believe in			0
' @entity3 opened fire with a @entity75 pistol on unarmed police in @entity78 's @entity77 in west @entity79 in 1966 when they approached a van he was in with two others ahead of an armed robbery			1
detective sergeant @entity84 , 30 , detective constable @entity84 , 25 , and pc @entity84 , 41 , were all killed in the attack on august 12 1966 his accomplices were caught but former soldier @entity3 , then 30 , remained on the run for 96 days – sparking @entity92 's biggest ever manhunt			1
he was found near @entity93 , @entity94 , living in a camouflaged den made out of plastic bags and branches			0
at his trial , @entity99 judge @entity4 justice @entity98 jailed him for a minimum of 30 years for what he called the ' most heinous crime for a generation or more '			0
he added : ' i think it likely that no home secretary , regarding the enormity of your crime , will ever think fit to show mercy by releasing you on licence			0
' notorious police killer @entity3 ( pictured right with a prison guard ) is to walk free 48 years after being told by a judge he should never be released however , the @entity6 has decided he should be released and he is expected to leave @entity116 in @entity117 within days			1
in the @entity119 , ministers were urged to keep the ' evil ' killer ' behind bars where he belongs '			2
labour former minister @entity122 warned the public are ' absolutely furious ' that @entity3 will be released from prison within days , despite being warned he faced dying in jail			1
he told commons leader @entity126 : ' people out there are absolutely furious at today 's news that the notorious police killer @entity3 is due to be released			1
' the police are saying it 's a betrayal , ( home secretary @entity10 ) herself promised the country that life should mean life for anybody convicted of killing a police officer			2
' i want to know what 's the government going to do to ensure this evil criminal is kept behind bars where he belongs			2
' mr @entity126 replied : ' there will be a great deal of sympathy with what you have just said			0
' this is , as i understand , a decision by the @entity6 but of course there will be concern about it and a great deal of public agreement with what you said			1
' i will certainly draw the home secretary 's attention to your raising of this and the concern in the @entity163 about it			2
' @entity79 mayor @entity164 said people would be ' absolutely sickened ' by the release			1
he added : ' they will find it hard to understand how a man who shot dead three police officers in this city in the most horrific fashion can now enjoy the freedom he denied his victims			2
' to my mind , in the case of the murder of a police officer , life should mean life			2
' @entity3 murdered three officers in 1966 in @entity78 's @entity77 before going on the run for 96 days mr @entity4 stressed that it was ' a decision not by @entity10 … it 's by the @entity184 '			1
he added : ' i understand that this provokes a lot of controversy , of course i do			0
' but one of the founding principles of the way that we do justice in this country is that you have an independent bunch of people who look at the behaviour of offenders who are behind bars and make a judgement about whether someone can be released or not			0
and of course there 's a role for the home secretary as well			0
' he admitted there ' are circumstances ' in which mrs may could block the release , but refused to say whether she should use the powers in the @entity3 case			1
@entity79 mayor @entity164 said people would be ' absolutely sickened ' by the release ' you quite understandably want to invite me to second guess judges , to second guess probation officers , to second guess @entity220 , taking decisions			1
do you know what ? on this occasion i 'm not			0
' i think i want to vigorously protect the system which allows decisions like this to take place , however controversial and unpopular they are			0
' because we have to have a system in which people for a whole range of grounds , whatever it can be compassionate grounds , grounds to do with rehabilitation , can be released from prison			0
' the decision has been taken for this character to be released after 48 years in prison			0
' you have to protect the integrity of people being able to decide whether someone is released in this case after 48 years			0
however unpopular it might be with some people			0
' he is coming out of jail because that 's what the probation panel board have decided			0
' pressed again on whether mrs may should use her powers as home secretary to intervene , mr @entity4 added : ' she has clearly decided not to			0
' @entity255 insisted it was a decision for the @entity6			1
@entity258 's official spokesman said : ' the prime minister will very much understand the strength of feeling that this case will provoke			1
' of course there is very rightly and understandably a widely held view among the @entity265 public that the murder of policemen and women is a particularly heinous act			0
' he very much understands the strength of feeling			1
' a spokesman for the @entity6 said : ' we can confirm that a three member panel of the @entity6 has directed the release of @entity3			1
' the decision to release is a matter for the @entity6 , which is independent - arrangements and the date of the release are a matter for the secretary of state for justice			1
we are unable to comment further on the details of this case			0
' a @entity286 spokesman said : ' we do not comment on individuals			0
' the release of life sentence prisoners is directed by the independent @entity6 once they are satisfied they can be safely managed in the community			1
' once released , they are subject to strict controls for as long as their risk requires them			0
if they fail to comply with these conditions , they can be immediately returned to prison			0
