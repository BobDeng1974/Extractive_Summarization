by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 17:29 est , 27 december 2013 @entity3 : 05:32 est , 29 december 2013 @entity4 , 56 , plays @entity5 in @entity7 ’s @entity6 , a two - part adaptation of @entity10 ’s tale of smuggling and adventure in the 18th century			1
here @entity4 , star of movies such as @entity14 and @entity15 , takes us behind the scenes on the drama , filmed on location in @entity20			2
top dog : @entity4 swaps @entity22 for robbery in @entity7 's new smuggling drama , @entity6 @entity26 of the drama in the first part of @entity6 revolves around the battle between @entity5 and @entity30 , played by @entity31 , a magistrate determined to stamp out @entity5 ’s smuggling in the @entity34 village where the story is set			1
the scene we ’re filming today involves quite a lot of running as @entity39 and his sidekick @entity40 , played by @entity41 , attempt to escape the law			1
i ’m not getting any younger , but i ’m determined to carry on doing action sequences for as long as i can			0
i ’ve earned my pint of @entity47 at the end of the day … tuesdaytoday we ’re at @entity50 beach in @entity51 for a scene where @entity10 is emerging from the ocean , dripping wet and starkers			0
we ’re all highly amused to find a busload of @entity57 tourists arriving to see this particularly beautiful beach , just as @entity41 leaves the sea totally naked ! he ’s a brave boy is @entity41 and he carries on regardless , finishing the scene like a pro. once we ’ve finished chuckling , there ’s time to admire this spectacular coast which is like the @entity66 in @entity67 – only colder			2
there are seals here too – what a fantastic place ! fire ! @entity4 's @entity39 teaches @entity40 ( @entity41 ) how to work a flintlock pistol loveable rogue : @entity4 has made playing villains with a heart such as @entity39 into an art form wednesday today @entity5 is teaching @entity10 how to fire a flintlock pistol [ right ]			1
there ’s quite a lot of shooting with flintlocks in @entity6 , and they ’re quite tricky to handle , so we ’ve had lessons			0
i ’m not bad but the miracles of the editing process may make @entity5 look a bit more proficient than i actually am ... thursdayin the second part of @entity6 , @entity5 and @entity10 take to the high seas in pursuit of @entity92 ’s fabled diamond			2
we do n’t actually get on board a ship – but it certainly feels like it ! a large section of a sailing ship has been constructed and put on hydraulics in the car park of the old @entity101 cigarette factory in @entity102 , where we ’re being bombarded with gallons of water			0
it ’s the nearest thing to being in a tempest without actually being at sea and it ’s hard graft ! we ’re never sure where the boat ’s going to shift next so those looks of fear and surprise on our faces are genuine			0
on set : @entity4 talks to members of the crew on the first day of filming @entity6 in @entity20 chilly : @entity41 and @entity120 take cover under a puffa coat in between takes unlucky day : @entity41 appears to be feeling the cold during his @entity125 style beach scene in @entity6 bracing : villain mr @entity126 ( @entity31 ) gallops up to his daughter @entity127 and the errant @entity40 fridaywe ’re completing our final scenes and i hope @entity6 is the kind of exciting , escapist drama people will want to watch as a family at this time of year			1
i ’ve suffered a few bumps and bruises during filming but nothing that wo n’t heal			0
and i ’m sure all the @entity47 i ’ve consumed has been good for me ! we ’re in @entity138 , @entity139 today – stunningly beautiful surroundings for a gruesome scene in which those who have caused @entity142 great displeasure suffer a horrible punishment			0
what a lovely way to finish the job ! @entity6 , tonight and tomorrow , 8pm , @entity7 .			1
