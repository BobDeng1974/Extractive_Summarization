' it was like a step toward getting this off my shoulders and being able to speak about it , ' said @entity1 , 35 , who lives in @entity101			1
' i have a kid now , and i do n't want this to be one of those dark family secrets that nobody talks about			2

that was just so helpful for me , and i feel now that it 's helped many other people , ' @entity1 said			2
@entity179 said in suicide notes and a last call with his wife that he was tormented by unsubstantiated memories of having molested a couple of young relatives and by the death of his daughter in 1997 , shortly after she was born			0
his mother first shared her story nine months after the october 2 , 2006 , slayings at @entity191 , when a friend from work asked her to speak to some @entity195 exchange students			0
the message resonated , and @entity1 said she felt a calling from @entity198			2
@entity1 remains close with @entity179 ' wife , @entity199 , who is also breaking her silence with a book , one light still shines , which shares a similar message of hope amid despair			2
like her former mother - in - law , @entity206 has relied on her @entity209 faith to carry her through the worst time in her life			2

' we have a lot of work to do to live up to what we are bragged up to be , ' he continued			0
' everyone was talking about this forgiveness thing , and i felt that was putting a lot of weight on our shoulders to live up to that			0
' @entity4 was n't expected to survive after being shot in the head			2
she laughs , cries and responds to stimuli , and @entity240 said she is mentally alert			0
but she requires constant care			0
@entity1 ' weekly visits with @entity4 force her to confront the damage her son caused			1
but @entity1 also finds peace as she spends time with @entity4 and provides some relief to the teen 's family , if only for a few hours			1
' beautiful young woman , but life is not as it should 've been for this little girl			0
