by @entity0 and @entity1 if @entity3 has taught us anything , it is that @entity6 - especially when its a love of collecting historical artifacts from a @entity11 battle almost 180 years ago			1
after spending his life scouring the earth for memorabilia from the @entity17 , the @entity13 singer appears to have finally completed his quest ... and is donating the trove to a @entity21 museum			2
the 63 - year - old @entity13 singer - drummer joked he 'd spent ' all the money that i made from music ' on 200 - plus pieces related to the battle where 1,500 @entity29 troops laid siege to 200 @entity31 in 1836			1
the @entity32 : after spending his life scouring the earth for memorabilia from the @entity17 , the @entity13 singer appears to have finally completed his quest ... and is donating the trove to a @entity21 museum homecoming : @entity3 made the announcement under the shadow of the @entity32 itself in @entity21 ' some people would buy @entity40 , some people would buy houses , i bought old bits of metal and old bits of paper , ' @entity3 said			1
' it 's at my home , in my basement in @entity50			2
i look at it every day , but no one else was enjoying it			0
' on thursday , @entity3 stood outside the @entity32 as he announced plans to donate his vast collection to the @entity21 museum			1
@entity3 has been an @entity57 since growing up in @entity58 and watching actor @entity59 portray @entity60 in 1955 @entity62 miniseries , ' @entity60 , @entity63 '			1
the series chronicled the frontier legend of @entity60 , who eventually died as one of the defenders of the @entity32			1
the last surviving roll from the @entity32 is included in the artifacts being donated to the @entity21 museum a flattened cannonball , pictured next to a quarter for scale , is part of the collection defense : an assortment of weapons , from axes and knives to guns , below , are also part of the collection ' i 've had a love affair with this place since i was about 5 years old , ' said @entity3 , who sweated in a button - down shirt and spectacles before a cheering crowd of dignitaries and tourists who gathered in front of the @entity32 for the occasion			1
' it was something that i used to go and play in the garden with my soldiers , ' he said			0
@entity3 said his favorite artifact was also his first , purchased for him in the 1990s by his then - wife : a receipt for the sale of the saddle of @entity100 , an @entity32 messenger who rode through @entity29 lines and pleaded for reinforcements before the battle			1
the collection also includes a rifle owned by @entity60 , his leather shot pouch and a pair of powder horns @entity60 is believed to have given to a @entity29 officer before his death — as well as muskets and musket balls that belonged to @entity29 soldiers			1
@entity3 says he has been obsessed with @entity60 since he was a child last stand : the ' last stand ' at the @entity32 on march 6 , 1836 came after a small band of @entity118 held out for 13 days against the army of @entity29 dictator general @entity120 ( pictured : a painting of the battle which hangs at the museum ) lifelong passion : @entity3 , 63 , said he became fascinated with the @entity32 story when he was growing up in the 1950s watching the television series ' @entity60 , @entity63 ' starring @entity59 ( right ) as the eponymous hero ( pictured with co-star @entity128 ) @entity3 said he first visited the famed battle site while on tour with his band in 1973			1
each band member was allowed to pick one place in the @entity118 trip - and he chose the @entity32			2
' i was just spellbound when i first saw it in person , ' he recalled			0
' having lived all my life , to see it in books and movies and the pictures in magazines , it was really quite extraordinary			0
' his decision to donate the items to the @entity32 was because he wanted the collection - which he is still adding to - to be kept together , @entity144 reported			2
' it does n’t end my involvement with @entity21 history			0
it ’s my intention to keep accumulating , keep collecting , and once i ’ve lived with whatever i buy for a month , i ’ll be shipping it here			2
' i ’m kind of a bit of a magnet now for things relating to the @entity157 , ' he said			0
@entity3 has agreed to ship the collection to @entity21 , but on the proviso that the museum updates the site and constructs a new building to house the collection			1
@entity3 has written a book , @entity165 and @entity166 , about his collection of artifacts helmets and explosive devices , which @entity3 has collected over the years , have been donated to a museum letters and other paperwork related to the @entity32 are included in the donation cherished : for 178 years , the @entity17 has been one of @entity118 's most cherished historical events and has been re-enacted in film on numerous occasions , including in the 2004 movie , @entity165 ( pictured ) another important relic is @entity182 's famous knife with which he is reputed to have fought tirelessly , killing many @entity29 during the onslaught			1
it was after him that the @entity182 knife was named			1
for 178 years , the @entity17 has been one of @entity118 's most cherished historical events			2
celebrated in song , story and cinema , the story of heroism against all the odds helped define the young nation 's pursuit of liberty			2
the ' last stand ' at the @entity32 on march 6 , 1836 came after a small band of @entity118 held out for 13 days against the army of @entity29 dictator general @entity120			0
the leaders of the group included @entity60 ( pictured ) , already famous as a frontiersman , storyteller and crack shot , and @entity182 , known for his distinctive knife			1
it has long been part of the @entity32 legend that @entity60 died fighting			1
news of the resistance helped garner support among the rebels , who defeated @entity120 's army at the @entity213 amid cries of ' remember the @entity32 ! ' the historic victory cemented the status of the newly formed @entity217			0
the legend was firmly established by the 1955 @entity62 tv show in which the hero was seen swinging an empty rifle as the hordes of @entity29 soldiers closed in for the kill			0
it has since been the subject of a host of @entity228 movies , including a 1960 @entity230 epic and a 2004 version with @entity232 and @entity233			0
in 2012 , the year after he announced his retirement from music because of health problems caused by drumming , @entity3 wrote a 384 - page book , @entity239 : a @entity240			1
he added : ' i 'm just an enthusiastic amateur			0
what i know is out there to be learned , it 's just that i took the time to do it , because of the book and to find out what i was buying			0
' @entity249 @entity248 said that although the building that will house the collection is not yet built , some items will be displayed as soon as october			0
the collection is worth millions but @entity3 said , ' being @entity255 , we do n't talk about that kind of thing			1
' he told the @entity258 : ' i 'm not extravagant in other ways , i live a very simple life			0
i mean , i came down here from @entity262 in a private plane so it 's not that simple			0
' but on the other hand , i do n't buy extravagant items like cars , expensive houses , jewellery			1
i 've got no other expensive interests			0
' my interests , for the last 25 years anyway , have been relics , buying things that are attached to something that i feel very interested about			0
even i have a limit … i was offered something once for a million dollars			0
' he said his love affair with the battle itself centred on the fact that ' people came here and made a stand here – for good or bad '			2
' that 's another political can of worms , ' he told the paper			2
' but for good or bad they came here knowing they were going to die , hoping they were n't but knowing they probably would , and that appealed to me even at six or seven , the idea of being that brave			0

@entity3 donated 200 - plus pieces related to the 1836 battle to museum
