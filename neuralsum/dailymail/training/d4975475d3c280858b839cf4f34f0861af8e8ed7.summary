the row over the cost of @entity3 ’s police commissioners grew last night after a @entity5 investigation found that more than a dozen of them have appointed deputies on wages of up to £ 68,000			1
just weeks after the £ 75 million vote that saw a record low turnout for a national election , a third of the crime chiefs are giving jobs to councillors , magistrates and former police officers to help them in their roles			2
some are being paid £ 68,000 a year – more than backbench mps earn and almost enough to pay for three constables , who start on £ 23,500			2
@entity23 paid role : @entity25 , left , will be paid £ 65,000 for a 32 - hour working week by @entity28 pcc @entity26 , right , and continue to receive £ 27,000 for two other council jobs the new unelected jobs are being created even though police and crime commissioners ( @entity33 ) have offices full of staff from the @entity36 they replaced			1
they do not have to advertise the posts and many have handed them to friends and political allies			1
it has raised concerns that the @entity33 , who themselves earn up to £ 100,000 a year , are not as accountable as they were meant to be – and are wasting cash that could be spent on frontline services to catch criminals			2
@entity50 pals : @entity51 , right , will be paid £ 35,000 for a 22 - hour week , serving under new @entity53 @entity52 - both of whom sat on the old authority @entity57 , editor of the @entity58 on @entity33 , warned : ‘ if commissioners use taxpayers ’ money to put their mates in cushy jobs no one else can apply for , they risk damaging public confidence			1
’ @entity67 , chief executive of the @entity68 ’ @entity70 campaign group , said : ‘ elected police commissioners were meant to cut out the expense and unelected bureaucracy of @entity36			2
‘ taxpayers will be deeply depressed to see that they appear keen on appointing more bureaucrats			0
thankfully , voters will get the chance to vote out candidates who appear more keen on building empires than dealing with local policing priorities			0
’ business ally : @entity82 , left was chosen by @entity83 's new @entity33 and his @entity50 colleague sir @entity84 , right , new deputy commissioners include : meanwhile , @entity87 in @entity88 has appointed four ‘ assistant commissioners ’ – using a title given to senior officers in @entity92 – on £ 65,000 each , including his election agent , an established @entity50 activist called @entity94			1
extra help : @entity96 's new pcc @entity87 with @entity94 , one of four assistants each on £ 65,000 the highest paid deputy is former policeman @entity99 , on £ 68,000 as assistant to @entity101 in @entity102			1
in total , 16 of the @entity33 in @entity103 and @entity104 told @entity5 they will appoint deputies , on salaries totalling at least £ 468,000			0
@entity108 , who set budgets and priorities , have just one pot of money to spend on their own offices and the force they govern , totalling almost £ 8 billion a year nationwide			0
the more they spend on their staff , the less they will have for frontline police			0
all 41 @entity33 will meet for the first time tomorrow when they travel to the @entity122 to see @entity123 , the home secretary , and @entity125 , the policing minister			0
many will call for changes to their budgets , as forces have been told to make savings of £ 2.4 billion by 2015 .			0

new unelected jobs are being created even though police and crime commissioners ( @entity33 ) already have offices full of staff
many have handed them to friends and political allies
use of taxpayers ’ money to put @entity33 's ' mates in cushy jobs ' will damage public confidence , expert warns
@entity25 , a @entity150 councillor who will be paid £ 65,000 for a 32 - hour working week by @entity28 pcc @entity26 . he wrote that he chose her as she is a ‘ black *female* ’ who has the ‘ *empathy* and *emotional* *intelligence* ’ to *complement* his business *skills* . she will continue to receive £ 27,000 for two council roles .
@entity82 , *ex-mayor* of @entity159 , who will get £ *28,000* for two to three days a week in @entity160 . sir @entity84 , the @entity33 , said his @entity50 colleague was a businessman who had experience of local government .
@entity51 , who will be paid £ 35,000 to work 22 hours a week in @entity165 . he sat with the @entity33 , @entity52 , on the area ’s old @entity167 committee and , like him , is a @entity50 councillor .
