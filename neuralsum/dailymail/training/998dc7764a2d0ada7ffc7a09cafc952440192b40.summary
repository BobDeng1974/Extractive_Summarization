' in @entity29 today we risk having one rule for the rich and powerful and another for everybody else , ' said mr @entity3			0
' what we are seeing is the growth of hugely complex and aggressive tax avoidance schemes , often based offshore			1
' the sort of activity that has left the @entity29 a £ 34 billion hole in our nation 's finances			0
' that 's why we have to act			0
because this government has simply shrugged its shoulders over tax avoidance			2
it has failed to take action on tax havens			1

' prime minister @entity0 was accused of ' turning a blind eye ' to tax avoidance the @entity7 leader has spent the week lambasting ‘ tax dodgers ’ in the wake of the @entity33 scandal , but he has also faced questions over his own family ’s practices			1
mr @entity3 and his family used a ‘ deed of variation ’ to divide the ownership of the family home in @entity78 these legal documents – which change the terms of someone ’s will after they have died – are used almost exclusively to reduce death duty bills in a legal form of tax avoidance			1

' the government 's failure to tackle tax avoidance is no accident			2
' it has turned a blind eye to tax avoidance because it thinks that so long as a few at the top do well , the country succeeds			1
