by @entity0 last updated at 4:17 am on 1st november 2011 a £ 1.4billion fund to boost economic growth has given grants to just seven firms so far , it emerged last night			1
the news came as deputy prime minister @entity6 announced the second round of the government ’s @entity8 which , it is promised , will pay out £ 950million to 119 firms nationwide			1
he said the investment would ‘ jump - start growth ’ and create or safeguard up to 200,000 ‘ jobs that last in the places that really need it ’			1
deputy prime minister @entity6 ( right ) talks to @entity16 , chief executive of @entity17 during a tour of the firm 's steel plant today			1
he announced that the government will invest £ 950million to support growth @entity23 , pictured with @entity25 prime minister @entity24 ( left ) and @entity27 prime minister @entity26 ( right ) at the @entity28 in @entity29 at the weekend , has promised to kick - start major infrastructure projects and get the economy moving but last night officials at the @entity33 admitted that , six months on from the first round of the growth fund , just seven of the 50 companies offered a share of the original £ 450million pot have received their cash			1
a steel firm in @entity6 ’s home city was yesterday offered £ 36million of taxpayers ’ money to expand – following a backlash against the deputy prime minister over the cancellation of a previous loan			1
@entity17 will be one of the most high - profile beneficiaries of the second round of the government ’s @entity8 , which is run by the @entity53 leader			2
the award follows a bitter row last year over the @entity57 ’s decision to cancel an £ 80million loan agreed by @entity59 in the run - up to the general election			2
mr @entity6 , the mp for @entity62 , denied that the u-turn was an attempt to repair the political damage he has sustained in the city			1
while touring the firm , he was repeatedly asked whether the money was a payment to shore up his own position			0
‘ this is not about any politician , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s genuinely about what we can do together – the government and companies like @entity17 – to restore a sense of hope and confidence and growth to the economy			2
’ he insisted that the loan promised by @entity59 was judged to be ‘ unaffordable ’			0
aides to mr @entity6 said he had not taken part in the decision to hand the new money to @entity17 due to his local connections			1
the firm , best known for unwittingly making parts for @entity92 ’s ‘ supergun ’ project in 1990 , is a highly respected manufacturer specialising in steel forgings and castings			0
the figures represent an embarrassment for @entity23 , who yesterday said officials had been ordered to ‘ strain every sinew ’ to get money for investment and infrastructure projects out the door			2
ministers were also facing questions over the allocation of the grant money , much of which has gone to multinationals including the @entity109 car - maker @entity108 , the @entity112 bank @entity111 and @entity113 engineering firm @entity110			0
other businesses benefiting from state support include @entity116 and @entity117			2
@entity118 , chief executive of the @entity119 , said the money was coming through too slowly – and not necessarily going to the firms that needed it most			0
‘ when you look at the first tranche , which was announced much earlier this year , until the beginning of last month not a penny had been paid , ’ he said			0
‘ it is only just beginning to filter through			0
‘ very few projects are benefiting , and we are seeing that a lot of the businesses it is going to are businesses that are already doing incredibly well			0
‘ the delays are hugely important			0
with the length of time it is taking for decisions to be made and for money to come through it is going to be a long time yet before we see any benefits			0
’ the prime minister was challenged in the @entity143 over the fund last month – when the @entity59 leader @entity145 revealed that just two firms had received their grants			2
@entity148 piled pressure on officials to accelerate the process , and mr @entity23 claimed last week that the initiative was ‘ on schedule ’ , with ‘ about 40 projects ’ helped			0
but the government last night said that only seven firms ’ grants had been processed			0
the rest will not be handed out until the completion of ‘ due diligence ’			0
demonstrators dressed as vampires wear @entity23 and @entity6 masks as they protest the government 's proposed public sector pension reform today			1
the real - life dastardly duo expect ' many more ' infrastructure project announcements over the autumn luxury car companies were among the businesses to benefit from the nearly £ 1billion of grants announced by the government today			2
@entity116 , based at @entity173 in @entity174 , said its £ 3million grant would safeguard more than 200 jobs			1
and another luxury car company , @entity117 , based at @entity179 in @entity180 , was also on the list of firms that had been successful in getting a @entity8 ( @entity8 ) grant			0
@entity116 said its grant would help support the development of a new engine and would also create a small number of extra jobs within the company 's 900 - strong engineering department			1
@entity116 chairman and chief executive @entity192 said : ' this is a real boost for @entity116			0
this grant will help safeguard our engineering operations as we look to develop new power trains which appeal to new markets and new customers			2
' the latest grant , which follows an earlier £ 1.68million @entity8 payment , will mean @entity116 is making plans to increase its graduate and apprentice intake next year			2
business secretary @entity206 said : ' this is a very significant boost to local communities , and the @entity8 will help businesses like @entity116 drive local growth			1
' mr @entity145 yesterday described the funding as ‘ too little , too late ’ and pointed out that the £ 1.4billion allocated over three years was a third of the money made available through @entity59 ’s @entity214 , which are being scrapped by the @entity57			2
he also accused the government of undermining manufacturing by slashing capital allowances – a move which could see 200,000 firms lose tax breaks worth up to £ 30,000			1
ministers insist that the @entity8 has the potential to make a major impact , particularly in parts of the country that have struggled to attract private investment			2
in addition , mr @entity6 said yesterday that every pound of the fund would be matched by at least £ 5 of private sector investment			1
the funding announcement came as the prime minister gave the green light to two power plants – at @entity235 , in @entity236 , and @entity237 , in @entity238 – which will create 1,000 construction jobs			1
@entity241 sources suggested that both announcements had been rushed forward in anticipation of today ’s official growth statistics , which are expected to show the recovery is still sluggish			2
ahead of the figures ’ release , mr @entity23 said that ‘ strong growth alone is not the goal ’			2
he continued : ‘ our ambition is to build a new and better economy			0
this coalition has the determination to do the right thing for our country			0
