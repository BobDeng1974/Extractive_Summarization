the vibrant sounds and smells of @entity2 had been calling me back since i first visited the @entity5 area in 2011 - the year after i won @entity7 gold in the skeleton at the @entity9			1
i was in @entity2 filming a survival reality tv show , and after it was over i stayed in touch with @entity13 , one of the guides who had helped train us for the show			1
he kept telling me amazing stories of the incredible areas of @entity2 that i should come back and visit one day			1
and here 's us in @entity23 : @entity24 travelled with her fiance @entity25 on her second visit to @entity2 in three years i could n't resist , and three years later he ended up putting together a personalised safari for me and my fiance , @entity25			1
@entity30 has been guiding safaris in @entity2 and throughout @entity23 for over ten years			1
he and his partner @entity32 and they specialise in getting to the core of why people go on safari , and what they want to experience			1
@entity30 called me one evening and said : ' @entity38 , i 'm taking you on a journey , not a holiday			1
' at @entity43 in northern @entity2 - the ' gateway to the @entity5 ' - @entity30 and @entity42 loaded us up in their open - sided game - viewing vehicle			1
i switched off my phone and let the journey begin			1
our first destination was @entity51 , in the @entity52			2
this quirky , intimate camp , run by @entity54 and his son @entity55 , sits on top of a 90ft - high cliff , looking down on to the @entity58 at exactly the point where animals come to drink			2
just hanging out up here : @entity24 encountered local leopards during her grand journey through @entity2 we were greeted by five bull elephants drinking in the river , with a couple of zebras roaming around close by , and a hippo seeming to watch over all of them from the middle of the river			1
with a gin and tonic in our hands , we watched a beautiful sunset with the wildlife below			2
i never realised how alive the bush of @entity2 could really be			1
as we awoke the next morning to the sounds of birdlife surrounding us , hot water arrived for our brass bucket showers			1
these showers are perfectly positioned overlooking the river , giving the most incredible experience of showering while an elephant wanders by 150ft away on the other side of the river			2
after a hearty breakfast we were off			2
@entity30 took us out to the @entity89 , the last remnant of an ancient lake			2
we arrived at the most incredible setting			2
as far as the eye could see was endless salt pan			2
that night , we slept out under the stars , with a view of the milky way all the way to the horizon			2
in the morning , on our way back to @entity102 , i was excited to hear @entity30 say he could see some meerkats coming out of their burrow			2
meerkats take lots of time to warm up in the early sunshine			1
we spent quite some time watching them slowly emerge to start their day of foraging			1
before leaving @entity102 , @entity30 took us on a walk with the @entity111			2
the bush is their home , and they gave us a really interesting insight into it			2
they showed us how they set traps for food , how they make fire , and some of the interesting ways they entertain themselves			2
they have what i can only describe as a fast - paced version of rock , paper , scissors			2
we continued our journey to @entity30 's favourite area within @entity2 , @entity134 in the north - eastern @entity5			1
a bird 's eye view : @entity24 and @entity25 also had close - up glimpses of elephants ( and their passengers ) in the wild i vividly remembered @entity30 mentioning this area three years previously for being a wildlife paradise - and our drive there showed me he was not wrong			1
what will always stick in my mind is the magical sight of 12 giraffe silhouettes in the road with the sun setting behind them			2
we were staying at @entity151 run by @entity152 , a veteran of the @entity2 safari industry			1
it looks like something from the style pages of a glossy magazine , with all the homely warmth of a country manor , and set in the most beautiful surroundings on the @entity161			1
@entity162 is also incredibly eco-friendly			2
it recycles everything , and has a practically non-existent footprint , while remaining very luxurious - a perfect balance for me			0
@entity168 is situated among the trees at the edge of @entity161			0
there is nothing more peaceful and relaxing than having meals while watching elephants drinking , and nothing more thrilling than watching a male and female leopard wandering along the river bank on the other side			0
just incredible ! the wildlife that @entity30 had raved about in @entity134 did not disappoint			0
during our three nights there we saw a big male lion hunting a large warthog , a beautiful female leopard waking after a day 's sleep , three honey badgers , a pack of wild dogs on the hunt , and a hyena den with five cute youngsters			0
spot me if you can : leopards are elusive , but there will always be chances to see them on a break in @entity2 the next stop in our journey was a real treat for me			1
@entity30 wanted to take me back to near where we had been filming three years ago			0
this time i was going to be horse riding at the quite wonderful @entity23 @entity207 camp , @entity208 , where they have 48 of the best looked - after horses i have ever seen			1
rides at @entity208 are more adventurous in the mornings than the afternoons , and we took the opportunity to get some speed up in the open floodplains			0
it is quite incredible to approach buffalo , giraffe , elephants and zebra ( my favourites ! ) on horseback			0
@entity223 is set in a beautiful area right in the heart of the @entity5 , and is only accessible by light aircraft or helicopter			0
while i was riding , @entity30 took @entity25 off for game - drives , boat cruises or fishing			0
every meal was taken out under the beautiful @entity23 starry night sky , and all the staff were so welcoming and friendly			1
we really felt at home here and were very sad to leave			0
from @entity208 , we flew off to @entity237 in the very north of @entity2 and then crossed the mighty @entity238 to reach the final destination in our journey , @entity241 , on the @entity243 side of @entity244			1
on our first morning in our very spacious room at @entity247 & @entity248 lodge , upstream of @entity244 , we woke up to the sounds of the @entity238			1
after so much activity and travelling , i was looking forward to a relaxing morning			0
i went off for a spa treatment overlooking the river and fell asleep in no time			1
i was ready for this			0
and here 's me doing the day job : @entity24 won gold in the skeleton at the @entity9 in @entity258 and it was heavenly			1
@entity30 surprised us at lunchtime with a trip into @entity241 , and before we knew it we were being whisked off in a helicopter for a scenic flight over @entity244			0
it is very easy to see from that perspective why it is one of the seven natural wonders of the world			0
the date happened to be friday the 13th , and a full moon was due			0
late in the afternoon , @entity30 took us for a walk around the falls and , after exploring for some time , we were surprised to find a small table set up with snacks and champagne			1
we sipped and nibbled away as the moon rose in the east behind a small cloud bank and created the amazing effect of a rainbow in the spray of @entity244			0
it was surreal and amazing all at the same time			1
back at @entity247 & @entity248 we were waited on like royalty			0
the food was spectacular in taste and presentation			0
the staff set up a private dinner for us at the edge of the @entity238 with a fireplace and yet more champagne			0
we ate to the sounds of hippos grunting in the distance , the flowing water and the crackling of the fire			1
on our last full day , @entity30 took us to @entity302 which sits at the very top of the falls			0
here we had a very traditional brunch of eggs benedict and tea , while being a matter of feet away from the edge of the waterfall			0
key knowledge : @entity24 had a demonstration of local skills - including how to make fire - from @entity316 bushmen @entity244 are a mile wide and @entity302 sits about halfway along the top			0
we were guided to the edge of the falls and given the most incredible view over the brink , looking the 360ft down into the gorge			0
there is so much spray that there are rainbows all over the place			0
before we left @entity2 , we headed into the @entity328 for a walk to find rhinos			1
this did n't take long as the park is very small and rangers follow the rhino around 24 hours a day , to protect them from poachers			0
being so close to such a huge animal on foot , was both exciting and terrifying all at once			0
we saw seven different rhino , including one very cute baby with its mother			0
it was also heartening to know that i was contributing in a small way to the value of the rhino as a tourist attraction , rather than as a medicine			0
@entity30 and @entity42 had introduced us to a different way of taking a holiday			1
our trip to @entity2 was , in fact , not just a holiday but a journey full of experiences			1
we will go back on safari to @entity23 again one day , because i know i will have to feed the piece of my soul that @entity23 has claimed			1
