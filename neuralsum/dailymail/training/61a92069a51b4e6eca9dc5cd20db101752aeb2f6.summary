by @entity0 published : 16:08 est , 3 april 2013 updated : 16:48 est , 3 april 2013 how does one commemorate a parent one has never known ? one weaves fantasies perhaps and , with time , those thoughts and images become entrenched as facts			1
but as we know , the past can creep up and surprise us with the revelation that it really was n’t like that at all			2
my father has always been a dark room in my inner life — one for which i could never find the light switch			1
he left our comfortable suburban home in 1959 , when i was four , having peremptorily announced to my mother that he was leaving her , me and my baby sister for his secretary			1
deceit : four - year - old @entity0 , right , and family pose for a photographer on the day father @entity24 walked out my mother claimed later she had no inkling this was about to happen , and she certainly never altogether recovered from the shock of his betrayal			1
the strangest detail of this story is that , on the day he left , my father commissioned a photographer to take some pictures he could remember us by			1
i have a vivid memory of this interesting stranger with a flash camera , clicking away as i was watching the tv over sunday teatime , eating chocolate cake off the best crockery			2
but i have no memory of what followed : of my father ’s departure and absence , of the tears , grief , fear and anger that must have accompanied them , i can recover no trace			1
all i know of this epoch in my life is what my mother later told me : that for a few months after his bunk , my father , @entity24 , occasionally came back to see my sister and me at weekends			1
but being a busy and ambitious journalist , with a senior position on the @entity62 ( eventually he became its editor ) , other things seemed to take priority			2
' it was n't that i hated him : he was merely a void			2
i do n't think i would even have recognised him had i passed him on the street ' one day , he left me waiting outside @entity69 for an hour beyond the appointed time , and my enraged mother told him that if he could n’t come when he said he would , then he had better not come at all			1
‘ he scuttled off like a frightened rabbit , ’ she added			2
he died in 1983 , nearly half a century later , but that was the last i saw of him			2
children of the age of four , five , six must have strategies for coping with this sort of trauma that no psychoanalyst can ever excavate			2
in my case , this involved an oath of blind loyalty to my mother and a total obliteration of my father			1
as the song has it , i simply washed that man right out of my hair and forgot about him — at what cost to my emotional development i can never calculate			2
it was the easy way out , but in the short - term effective			2
i was an anxious , timid child , but a reasonably functioning one , with a secure domestic environment , my mother ’s love , friends of my own age and a degree of academic success to buttress me			1
sometimes my father sent a birthday or @entity102 present ; sometimes he did n’t			1
his final effort came on my 11th birthday in 1965 , when he sent me a @entity106 razor — a gadget i found utterly inexplicable , not least because my pre-pubescent chin was stubble - free			2
my mother was furious at my father ’s lack of sensitivity and i guess she made her rage known to him			1
in any case , he never sent anything ever again , either to me or my sister , and that was that			2
throughout my teenage and early adult years , i was repeatedly urged by well - meaning parties , at school and at home , to seek out my father — and my mother nobly made it clear i had her licence to do so — but i never wanted anything to do with him			1
@entity0 and his sister share a rare moment with their father : he became a stranger to them as they grew up it was n’t that i hated him : he was merely a void			1
i do n’t think i would even have recognised him had i passed him on the street , except that once , in my mid- 20s , i had been flicking idly through a book of @entity137 ’s photographs when my eye alighted on a face i felt was vaguely familiar			0
only when i looked down at the caption did i realise it was my father			1
the news he had died at the wheel of his car after suffering a stroke left me entirely indifferent , except to wonder whether he had left me any money ( eventually i received a small yield on a life insurance policy )			1
i did not go to his funeral : my mother thought it would be more tactful to send flowers , but i was at a loss as to how to sign the card			0
@entity157 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity157 , @entity157 , you bastard ? i did n’t even have a name for him			0
to this day i do not know where his grave is or even whether he has one			1
the turning point for me came long after his death			0
when my paternal grandmother died at a venerable age , her house was cleared out and my cousin found a stash of letters my father had written home when he was evacuated to the @entity173 during the war			1
' suddenly , i found the switch for the light in that dark inner room , and felt compelled to find out more about this man ' my cousin , with whom i had stayed in distant contact , thoughtfully sent them to me , rather than to the son of my father ’s second marriage , and for that gesture i am profoundly indebted to her			1
reading these letters was a revelation			0
only 13 when he left @entity188 , 15 when he returned , my father emerges from these wafer - thin , impeccably typed sheets as prematurely sophisticated and a precocious master of prose			1
billeted in the suburb of @entity194 , @entity195 , he was sent to a private school , where he had a marvellous time posing as an eccentric @entity188 , editing the school magazine and appearing in productions of @entity200 and @entity201 , as well as trying to win the affections of the prettiest girls			0
but one can also sense his emotional resemblance to his fictional contemporary @entity205 in @entity206 — someone forced to grow up unnaturally fast , concealing his anxieties behind a mask of wit and nonchalance			0
the thing that shocked and thrilled me above all , however , was the discovery of a passage that explained why he had sent that razor			0
it comes in a letter dated february 1941 , when my father was still 13			1
‘ the shaving so far has been moderate , ’ he tells his parents			0
‘ once every three weeks , i cut off the rapidly stiffening stubble			0
the razor is a beauty , a @entity223 , and there is no shortage of blades			0
’ it was clearly a sensitive issue			0
then , in april 1942 , he reported that for his 15th birthday he had received from his younger sister ‘ 20 razor blades , as i had used up my first packet of @entity223 blades ’			0
‘ my son will never be advised not to shave , ’ he continued , ‘ providing he has something worth cutting off			0
i have now been shaving for 16 months , and i still only have to shave every two weeks , whereas one would imagine from the pre-razor period that i would be getting up ten minutes earlier every morning to shave stiff bristles by now			0
’ moved on : only now , decades on and after his father 's death , has @entity0 forgiven him so there it was : a gift that had seemed indifferent or callous was intended as a blessing — a clumsy attempt at a father - and - son thing , a remotely controlled push through a rite of passage that finally made sense to me after nearly half a century			1
suddenly , i found the switch for the light in that dark inner room , and felt compelled to find out more about this man who had bequeathed me half my genes			0
i found the courage to contact some of his mirror colleagues , who generously shared their reminiscences			0
i was fascinated to realise that even people who had worked with him closely for years were entirely unaware of the existence of his first family			1
i also tracked down my half – sister , whom i had never met			0
life being an ironic business , it transpired she lived near my @entity270 home and we had probably been passing each other in the aisles of @entity274 ’s for years			0
did we bond ? not really			0
but at least our 15 - minute cup of coffee cleared the fetid air			0
most tellingly , my father made his first appearance in my dreams			1
my sister and i were driving a clapped - out @entity281 down long country lanes with high hedgerows			0
at the dead end of the road was a vast spreading oak — a tree of the ages , exuding wisdom and strength and calm			0
under its benign shadow , like job in @entity294 ’s painting , stood my father , in a suit and tie , smiling and expectant			2
as i got out of the car and moved to greet him , he fell to his knees and i realised he was barefoot			0
i do n’t know quite how to interpret this strange tableau , but it feels as though something has healed			0
