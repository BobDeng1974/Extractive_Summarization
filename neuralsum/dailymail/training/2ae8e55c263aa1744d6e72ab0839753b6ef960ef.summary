it can be hard to find enough hours in the day to catch up on both work and exercise			0
but now experts have designed a treadmill which allows runners to read while they are jogging			1
the system , called @entity7 , adjusts text on a monitor to counteract the bobbing motion of a runner 's head so that the text appears still			1
@entity7 adjusts text on a monitor to counteract the bobbing motion of a runner 's head so that the text appears still @entity16 , an assistant professor of industrial engineering at @entity18 , where the treadmill was invented , said : ' not many people can run and read at the same time			1
' ' this is because the relative location of the eyes to the text is vigorously changing , and our eyes try to constantly adjust to such changes , which is burdensome			2
' the small font size in text adds to the difficulty , he said			1
' you could increase the font size and have a large - screen monitor on the wall , but that 's impractical because you can not have numerous big screen displays in an exercise room			2
' it comes after @entity40 experts created @entity41 , a desk that fits over a treadmill , enabling users to walk slowly while they work the researchers developed @entity7 on the hypothesis that the primary impediment to reading while running is the head 's vertical movement			1
the new system allows a treadmill user to read normal - size text on a small monitor mounted in front of the machine			1
findings appear online this month in human factors : the journal of the @entity59			0
the paper was authored by @entity16 , doctoral candidate @entity61 , and @entity62 , an associate professor of statistics			0
the study included 15 students , who carried out a ' letter - counting ' task while running on a treadmill and using @entity7			1
the test requires participants to count how many times the letter @entity72 occurs in two lines of text situated among 10 lines displayed on a computer monitor			1
the user wears goggles equipped with infrared @entity79 , and an infrared camera captures the @entity79 , tracking the runner 's bobbing head			1
then the text is moved in unison with the head movement , taking into consideration the human reflex to compensate for motion			1
' our eyes can accommodate vibration to a certain degree , ' said @entity16 , director of @entity18 's @entity92 , or @entity93			0
' there are compensatory reflex mechanisms that tend to stabilize the head and eyes to maintain gaze and head position			2
' @entity61 led work to create an algorithm to correctly move the text , accounting for this reflex			2
' you ca n't just move the text exactly in synch with the head because the eye is already doing what it can to compensate , ' he said			1
' so you have to account for that compensation by moving the text slightly out of synch with the head motion			1
' working at the @entity41 is said to help users achieve the holy grail of 10,000 steps a day within three hours the research showed a higher accuracy for people who used @entity7 compared to those in a control group			1
' we also measured whether participants gave up on counting the letters because the task was too difficult , ' @entity61 said			0
' we often saw people giving up without @entity7 , especially with certain font sizes and smaller spaces between lines			1
' the system also might be used by heavy equipment operators and aircraft pilots			0
' both may experience heavy shaking and turbulence while reading information from a display , ' he said			0
' @entity7 could stabilize the content in such cases			2
' @entity138 , a professor in the @entity139 , provided critical advice during preliminary investigations , and industrial engineering student @entity142 assisted post-experiment data analysis			0
doctoral student @entity144 in the @entity145 also was involved in the research			0
it comes after @entity40 experts created @entity41 , a desk that fits over a treadmill , enabling users to walk slowly while they work			2
the manufacturer claims the height - adjustable workstation allows individuals the opportunity to gain the necessary amount of exercise daily to maintain health , reduce stress , prevent disease and strengthen muscles			0
working at the @entity41 is said to help users achieve the holy grail of 10,000 steps a day within three hours			0
the desk , which costs Â£ 300 , is designed to fit over any treadmill and measures 72x34inches			2
it also features a manuscript holder , allowing you to read books , magazines or manuscripts while you type , talk and walk			0
working at the @entity41 is said to help users achieve the holy grail of 10,000 steps a day within three hours			0
it is also said to boost mood and productivity			0
