by @entity0 published : 10:02 est , 25 march 2013 updated : 11:34 est , 25 march 2013 embarrassing body odour could become a thing of the past thanks to a new range of summer clothing for men from @entity7			1
the high street store are incorporating @entity9 into the under arms of their latest suits and blazers			2
the innovative patches are made from nano - porous material that is designed to absorb body odour molecules and then neutralise them to avoid unpleasant smells			1
keeping cool : the @entity18 , £ 179 , uses @entity9 under the arms to prevent body odour but while fashion with the material is only just hitting the shops , it has had a lifesaving use for decades			1
during the @entity27 when chemical attacks were feared , the material was patented by the @entity28 for use in gas masks			0
embarrassing problem solved : excess sweating is not a good look - or smell lifesaving : the same material is used in gas masks because it can absorb and neutralise harmful gases the material can absorb and neutralise harmful gases so has been used in the production of chemical , biological , radiological and nuclear suits and gas masks since 1942			2
the patches may not be put to lifesaving use by @entity18 but it could spare many a modern man 's blushes by its ability to prevent smelly sweat patches			0
the technology is used in the @entity18 , £ 179 , and @entity50 blazer , £ 99 , that go on sale this month as part of the store 's summer range for men			0
@entity56 , who make the @entity9 used in the @entity18 clothes , say each patch ' has the surface area equivalent of a tennis court and last for the length of the garment , even after washing '			0
they add : ' @entity67 molecules from body odour are absorbed and permanently trapped within the material ’s structures until the garment is cleaned , either by hand or machine washing or by dry cleaning , and the molecules are flushed out			1
' the company also make patches for shoes called ' @entity79 ' that eliminate foot odours in the same way .			0

summer suits have ' @entity9 ' in *underarms*
the patches absorb body odour molecules , then neutralise them
same technology is used in gas marks
