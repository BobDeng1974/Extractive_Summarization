by @entity1 reporter any male , graduating seniors at @entity4 in @entity5 must first report to the school 's ' head penis inspector ' @entity6 for their mandatory penis inspection before their officially allowed to graduate			1
that 's according to a rather official looking flier that was distributed throughout the school last week , on which an illustration of a patriotic penis and the slogan ' no penis left behind ' also appears			0
believe it or not , penis inspector @entity6 is not real , and @entity4 does n't actually require its seniors to pass a penis inspection before they 're allowed to graduate - rather , school officials believe the amusing fliers are just a senior prank orchestrated by members of the school 's graduating class			1
@entity27 : school officials believe the amusing fliers were part of a prank pulled by graduating seniors ' late monday afternoon , fliers announcing a phony inspection notice for students were posted in the halls of @entity4 , ' the school district says in a statement obtained by @entity38			2
' the fliers , which mentioned a male body part , were removed and the dean of students at @entity4 is investigating			0
@entity44 administration is regarding this incident as a senior prank , and the infractions will be addressed according to school and district policies			0
' the pranksters - who explain on the fliers that circumcised and non-circumcised students must report to different locations to complete their inspection , and also that anyone with an erection will be given a failing grade - are not the first to pull the ' mandatory penis inspection ' stunt			1
in fact , the penis inspection prank has become somewhat common amongst graduating seniors at @entity63 high schools tradition : @entity4 ( pictured ) is just the latest of several @entity5 bay - area schools to fall victim to the penis inspection prank in 2012 , @entity69 - just across @entity70 from @entity4 - was the victim of a similar prank when a flier that was nearly identical to the one passed around @entity4 was distributed throughout the school			1
in 2011 , the same thing happened at @entity76 just south of @entity5			0
just in case any students have any questions about their mandatory penis inspections , they 're instructed to contact @entity82 - the ' director of @entity83			2

a flier was passed around @entity4 in @entity5 *claiming* that students who did n't pass a mandatory penis inspection would not graduate
the flier directed circumcised students and non-circumcised students to report to different locations for their inspections
all questions were directed to @entity82 , the ' director of *genital* *commissions* '
the penis inspection prank has been pulled in several other @entity70 - area schools over the past few years
