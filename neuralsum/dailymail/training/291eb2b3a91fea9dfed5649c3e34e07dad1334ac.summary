@entity0 is working on a super-fast ' quantum ' computer chip as part its vision to one day have machines think like humans			1
the @entity7 - based group has teamed up with leading physicist @entity8 to build processors based on quantum theories			1
the new hire is part of a ' hardware initiative ' to design and build chips operating on sub-atomic levels in ways that makes them much faster than existing processors			1
@entity0 said it is working on a super-fast ' quantum ' computer chip as part a vision to one day have machines think like humans			1
pictured is @entity0 ceo @entity25 standard computers deal with binary data expressed in zeroes and ones			2
however , quantum computing uses the behaviour of sub-atomic particles to encode data			2
experts believe that a quantum bit , which can have two states at the same time , may be able hugely improve the speed and power of computing			0
professor @entity8 currently works at @entity40 , @entity40 , and is one of the most prolific researchers in the area of artificial intelligence			1
his work with the company will be undertaken at the @entity47 , a collaboration between @entity0 , @entity49 and the @entity50 ( @entity50 )			2
' with an integrated hardware group , the @entity53 team will now be able to implement and test new designs for quantum optimisation and inference processors , ' @entity0 's director of engineering , @entity51 , said on its research blog			2
@entity0 , which is working on projects including self - driving cars and robots , has become increasingly focused on artificial intelligence in recent years			1
in january , the company acquired privately held artificial intelligence company @entity64			1
in january , @entity0 acquired privately held artificial intelligence company @entity64 co-founded by @entity65 ( left )			1
the company has the aim of trying to help computers think like humans ( right ) neuroscientist @entity65 , 37 , co-founded @entity64 just two years ago with the aim of trying to help computers think like humans			0
his company has yet to produce anything commercially but @entity0 still paid £ 242 million ( $ 399 million ) for its expertise in the pioneering field of artificial intelligence			1
the website states @entity64 uses ‘ the best techniques from machine learning and systems neuroscience to build powerful general - purpose learning algorithms			0
’ another of its founders , @entity84 , warned artificial intelligence is ' number one risk for this century , ' and believes it could play a part in human extinction			1
' eventually , i think human extinction will probably occur , and technology will likely play a part in this , ' @entity64 ’s @entity90 said in a recent interview			2
@entity0 has now set up an ethics board to oversee its work in artificial intelligence			1
@entity99 is one of the driving forces behind super-intelligent computers that could improve everything from space travel to electric cars			0
but the @entity106 - founder claims the technology could someday be more harmful than nuclear weapons			2
last month , the billionaire tweeted a recommendation for a book that looks at a robot uprising , claiming ‘ we need to be super careful with @entity53			0
potentially more dangerous than nukes			0
’ @entity99 referred to the book ‘ @entity120 , strategies ’ , a work by @entity117 that asks major questions about how humanity will cope with super-intelligent computers			0
mr @entity117 has also argued that the world is fake and we are living in a computer simulation			0
in a later tweet , @entity99 wrote : ‘ hope we 're not just the biological boot loader for digital superintelligence			0
unfortunately , that is increasingly probable			0
’ @entity99 's tweets follows a similar comment in june in which the @entity106 - founder said believes that a horrific ‘ terminator - like ’ scenario could be created from research into artificial intelligence			1
the 42 - year - old is so worried , he is investing in @entity53 companies , not to make money , but to keep an eye on the technology in case it gets out of hand			0
@entity99 is one of the driving forces behind super-intelligent computers			0
but in august , the @entity106 founder warned that @entity53 could to do more harm than nuclear weapons ( @entity145 pictured )			0

as part of the work , @entity0 has teamed up with physicist @entity8
the processors will work on sub-atomic levels making them much faster
technology could one day lead to machines able to think for themselves
@entity0 has set up ethics board to oversee work in artificial intelligence
