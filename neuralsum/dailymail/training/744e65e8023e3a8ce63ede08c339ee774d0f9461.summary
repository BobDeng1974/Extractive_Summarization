by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 last updated at 1:11 am on 11th february 2012 it was said of another general several millennia ago that he came , he saw and he conquered			2
@entity6 chief general @entity7 will probably realise too late , that living in a democratic polity the choice of the outcome depended not on his military skills , but the decision of two wise men who had probably never heard a gunshot fired in anger			1
in the process , he not only failed to get any redress from the @entity19 in his dispute over his age , but also lost the moral confidence to continue in office			2
losing battle : general @entity7 could now be forced to resign after his claim against the government was rejected justice @entity27 and justice @entity28 compelled him to withdraw his age row petition before the @entity19 after saying that it was not inclined to interfere with the government 's decision to consider his date of birth in the service records to be may 10 , 1950 , as against may 10 , 1951			1
they said that unless the decision was ' perverse or grossly erroneous ' it could not be interfered with in a petition under @entity41 , which the @entity7 had invoked to directly move the apex court against the alleged injustice			1
the fact that the age issue had gained such public currency , the question being asked all around was whether the @entity7 would now step down			1
speaking to @entity50 , lt gen ( retd ) @entity49 said that the army chief 's position was diminished in the eyes of his contemporaries and his men and it would be best if he resigns			1
' i am dejected that he gave up the fight , ' he said			2
' he should not have withdrawn his petition [ and fought on ]			1
' general @entity7 with defence minister @entity60			1
despite the army chief withdrawing his petition , the ties between him and government have become frosty his words were echoed by @entity65 ( retd ) @entity66 who felt that @entity67 ought to resign			1
he said that the army chief had done the right thing by fighting the issue to the bitter end and that he would not be surprised if indeed he resigned			2
it is a fact that the entire community of retired military personnel had strongly supported general @entity7 's petition and that the @entity19 decision will have major reverberations , especially if @entity67 does not step down from office			1
many former military personnel have seen the controversy as being akin to that faced by the revered @entity6 chief , general @entity82 , in 1959			2
the then army chief had resigned because of the interference by the then defence minister , @entity85			2
but prime minister @entity86 had persuaded him to withdraw his resignation , but later humiliated him by refusing to act on the issues @entity82 had raised			2
for the ex-servicemen fraternity , the @entity82 ( who served as chief from 1957 - 1961 ) issue is not history , but a contemporary comment on the shoddy manner in which the political and bureaucratic community has dealt with the uniformed personnel			2
the court 's position clearly indicated its unwillingness to delve into a quarrel between two important arms of the government - the army and the ministry of defence			1
' if it has come to the stage of washing dirty linen , you can do so , ' @entity108 told the defence counsel at one point			2
' but we thought both sides had been dignified and would not cross the line			0
' the apex court 's position echoed by many in the country was that this was a quarrel that should never have seen public light , and now that it had , it should be swiftly brushed under the carpet			2
but it was not just a matter of appearances , but of the fact that any order or decision by the court would have become a precedent and could have roiled the issue of the selection and tenure of the army chief			0
in that sense , the court felt that it was best if it said nothing			0
this was , after all , a personal matter relating to a claim of a date of birth			0
it was not a charge relating to corruption or some other act of criminality which the court would have found difficult to sidestep			0
general @entity7 left for the @entity152 in @entity153 soon after his petition on the date of birth row was withdrawn , signalling that it was business as usual for him and it was left for his aides to speculate that ' anything can happen ' on the question if he was contemplating resignation			1
brothers in arms : general @entity7 with lt gen @entity164 though the government withdrew the order which had been objected to by the court during the last hearing , it seemed to be a lost case for the general the moment proceedings started on friday			1
the @entity173 kept the @entity7 's counsel on the back - foot throughout the hearing by seeking explanations on @entity7 having himself mentioned the wrong date of birth on more than one occasion , on several documents recording 1950 as his date of birth , on not getting the error rectified within the time - frame set out in the rules and on not abiding by his repeated commitments to treat the matter closed			1
the court pointed out that the @entity7 had himself given a commitment to accept the decision by the government on the controversy and had accepted 1950 as the year of his birth			1
referring to three letters by the @entity7 undertaking to abide by any decision in the interest of the organisation , the court said it was a well thought decision by him as he ' stated , restated and further reiterated ' his commitment			1
' there may be many explanations for retracting from the commitment â€¦ but i do not think it would behove such a meritorious officer to take that position , ' @entity108 said			0
justice @entity28 , who was harsher , said : ' you could have gone to court ( instead of agreeing to accept may 10 , 1950 , as your date of birth )			0
but you did not and became the chief of armed staff			0
' you may be justified in raising a grievance			0
but this date ( may 10 , 1950 ) has been there over a period of time and last three promotions had been on this date , ' the @entity173 said			0
he said the court had no doubt he was honestly pursuing the matter and being the army chief he had every right to agitate his grievance before the highest court			2
he said everyone was proud of him defending the country			0
' judges do what others avoid			0
we have to take a decision ultimately , ' he said , sympathising with him			0
the only positive outcome of this sad controversy is that it may compel the government to pay serious attention to the dysfunctional relations between the civilians and the armed forces personnel in the ministry of defence			0
though the government claims that everything is fine , there is a gap which is getting worse by the day			0
a great deal of responsibility for this lies with the arrogance of the bureaucracy , which lacks the expertise to deal with military subjects and simply lacks an understanding of the military culture and ethos			0
by @entity258 out of time : general @entity7 was told that the record of his age had been on file for some time and he had not previously challenged it @entity6 chief general @entity7 on friday withdrew his petition on the age row after the @entity19 indicated that it was not inclined to interfere with the government 's decision to consider his date of birth in the service records to be may 10 , 1950 as against may 10 , 1951			1
a bench comprising justice @entity27 and justice @entity28 said unless a decision is ' perverse or grossly erroneous ' it could not be interfered with in a petition under @entity41 , which the @entity7 had invoked to directly move the apex court against the alleged injustice			1
the bench , however , observed that it had the highest regard for @entity67 and its order should not come in way of the assignment he was holding			0
' as the chief of armed services , you continue to serve the way you served ( the army ) for the last 38 years , ' it said			0
referring to other assignments that he might get after retirement , attorney general @entity288 said he hoped and prayed that this was not the end of @entity67 's service to the nation			2
though the @entity7 withdrew his petition , the decision should not be interpreted as a thaw in the relationship between him and the government			1
this was evident during the fag end of the hearing itself			0
on someone suggesting that the court could record in its order that the matter had come to an end following an amicable settlement , @entity288 said : ' no. there is no amicable settlement			0
' earlier , general @entity7 's counsel @entity309 , having been pushed to the wall with the court rejecting most of his arguments , stressed that the controversy had arisen because the government perhaps had some succession plan in mind			1
' as a counsel , i can not say certain things that have happened , ' he said			0
' if it has come to the stage of washing dirty linen , you can do so ... but we thought both sides had been dignified and would not cross the line , ' @entity108 said			0
though the government withdrew the order which had been objected to by the court during the last hearing , it seemed to be a lost case for the general the moment proceedings started on friday			0
the bench kept the @entity7 's counsel on the backfoot throughout the hearing by seeking explanations on the general having himself mentioned the wrong date of birth on more than one occasions , on several documents recording 1950 as his date of birth , on not getting the error rectified within the time - frame set out in the rules and on not abiding by his repeated commitments to treat the matter closed			1
the court pointed out that the @entity7 had himself given a commitment to accept the decision by the government on the controversy and had accepted 1950 as the year of his birth			1
referring to three letters by the @entity7 undertaking to abide by any decision in the interest of the organisation , the court said it was a well thought decision by him as he ' stated , restated and further reiterated ' his commitment .			1
