why women are weird : ' two kisses yesterday , one kiss today - he is definitely seeing someone else ! ' @entity9 requested the opportunity to work with @entity5 after seeing her fellow hub presenter @entity23 on last week 's episode , all about the perks of the spring season			1
the double act used to present together and now execute a hilarious rendition of 10 reasons why ... women are weird			1
@entity5 and @entity9 act out what women say to their boyfriends and how that differs from what they are really thinking			1
for instance , if she says she ' does n't mind at all ' if you go out somewhere she disapproves of , she 's probably thinking : ' if you go i 'll break your legs			0
' if you go out somewhere she disapproves of , she 's probably thinking : ' if you go i 'll break your legs ' @entity9 acts out a comic scene where she says : ' i love being tied up ! it was totally fine			2

' here , @entity5 goes mad at @entity9 for wearing the same shirt as her - something , they say , that would n't happen if two male friends were wearing the same top			1
@entity5 goes mad at @entity9 for wearing the same shirt - something , that would n't happen between men if men go out with their male friends , @entity5 says , and do n't text their girlfriend every five minutes , they 're obviously having a lap dance			1
@entity9 then paces up and down the living room as @entity5 reads a magazine , frantically cursing that her man must be interfering with a stripper if he has n't texted her in four minutes			1
@entity2 and @entity62 tweeted to their followers about the hilarious video starring @entity9 and @entity5 @entity5 observes her almost wrinkle - free face in a compact declaring her interest in using hemorrhoid cream to get rid of her eye bags			1
@entity9 looks disgusted at the prospect			0

@entity9 asks @entity5 to come to the bathroom			1
' i 'm so glad you 're here ' she says			0
' stroke my hair some more ' @entity9 asks @entity5 to come to the bathroom			1

with this she suggests all women are fans of the practice			0
' i 've already sniffed chocolate this morning , ' she says			0
@entity9 does n't find it so normal that @entity5 is a fan of sniffing chocolate			1
another weird habit ' honey i 've got a really bad headache , ' says @entity5 , head perched on a pillow in bed			2
her excuse for avoiding sex , when flipped on its head , is greeted with a hostile response			0
' why do n't you just tell me you 're cheating on me , ' she shouts			0
' why do n't you just tell me you 're cheating on me , ' she shouts , when her boyfriend excuses himself from sex before laying into @entity107 , @entity5 stresses that she holds no responsibility for the sexist undertone , a male friend had shared with her his squabbles with the female sex : ' why ca n't women learn to use their new @entity114 , tv or laptop rather than trying for one minute and passing it over for me to fix			2
' @entity9 presents this one with conviction			0
' i do n't know what you 're talking about			0
i have never farted in my life , that 's disgusting , ' she confesses to the camera			0

' i do n't know what you 're talking about			0
i have never farted in my life , that 's disgusting , ' she insists the video montage shows @entity5 and @entity9 crying at inanimate objects such as a sea shell and an iron			1
