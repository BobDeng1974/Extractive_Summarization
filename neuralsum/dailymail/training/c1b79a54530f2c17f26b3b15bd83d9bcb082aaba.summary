few predictions are certain when it comes to the future of air travel ... except this one			0
it looks like being a lot more comfortable			0
a @entity7 company has come up with adjustable plane seats you can book to suit your shape and size			1
it means larger passengers need not worry about squeezing into uncomfortable , tight spaces , moving to business class or paying double – they just book an expanded seat to fit them			2
and families can enjoy more comfortable flights without taking up more overall space – mothers and fathers can add a few notches to their seats while smaller children can have theirs scaled down			1
the @entity29 , as the seat has been called , also allows for the possibility of slimmer travellers paying less for occupying smaller spaces			0
the design by @entity35 firm @entity34 has already attracted attention from plane manufacturers such as @entity38 and @entity39			1
details of passengers ' sizes and needs will be fed into a computer and airline staff then adjust the varied seating arrangements at a touch of a button before take - off			2
@entity50 works by replacing the traditional foam pads used in airline seats with a fabric that is stretched across the width of three seats , around a frame and over formers , a little like a hi - tech hammock			1
it promises comfort without reducing leg room unlike traditional seats , which are created individually using foam padding , the new design is based around a single piece of fabric stretched across the back of a frame for three seats			1
another piece of fabric is placed along the bottom , creating a hammock - style chair			1
the frame includes ‘ formers ’ which move up or down underneath the fabric , allowing the passenger to alter the recline , as well as the height and depth of the seat pan , according to their size and comfort			1
crucially , the formers , which act as arm rests and dividers between the three seats , can also be moved left or right to alter their width , making the seats bigger or smaller			1
economy class airline seats are , on average , around 18in wide			0
squeezing into a small airline seat could become a thing of the past , but larger people might have to pay more for their airline seat if the new @entity29 concept becomes a reality but the @entity29 seats would allow , for example , a couple travelling with a young child to book two larger 22in seats to improve their comfort , while the child would occupy a smaller and cheaper 10in seat			1
@entity104 , of @entity105 , admitted that some airlines were resistant to charging people according to their size , but claimed passengers would welcome improved choice			2
larger travellers could see it as a better option than being charged twice over			0
‘ one airline told us that if they have an oversized passenger , they make them buy two seats , ’ he said			2
‘ i ca n’t think of anything more degrading or humiliating than forcing someone to buy two seats because they are a bit wide			0
’ the seats can be reclined and adjusted to suit an individual 's preferred seated position by moving the seat ' formers ' , which in turn morphs the fabric to provide a ' tailored fit and greater comfort , ' according to the firm mr @entity104 said the seats can also be adjusted to suit other needs such as privacy for lone travellers , mothers with children , people working or less abled passengers			1
the seats are unlikely to be fitted into existing aircraft , so it could be more than a decade before the @entity29 design is introduced			2
however , some airlines have already adopted similar seating plans			0
@entity146 ’s @entity145 feature ‘ @entity147 ’ , a row of three economy seats that can be turned into a sofa			0
and earlier this year @entity39 announced it would be offering an additional two inches on some aisle seats on its new @entity153 jets to keep up with ‘ demographic trends ’			0
analysts have suggested imposing a ‘ fat tax ’ on passengers above a certain weight to cope with demands from larger passengers			0
in april , @entity161 became the first airline to operate a ‘ pay - by - weight ’ system .			0

@entity7 design firm @entity34 has designed @entity50 to offer passengers choice over the amount of space they pay for
the width of the seat can be adjusted , while an individual can also control the seat pan height and depth , to make sure they are comfortable
@entity50 uses a fabric that is stretched across the width of three seats , around a frame and over formers , a little like a hi - tech hammock
