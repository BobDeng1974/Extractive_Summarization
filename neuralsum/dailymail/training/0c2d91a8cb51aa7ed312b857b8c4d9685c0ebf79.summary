it has been a longstanding mystery for scientists - how water arrived on @entity3			1
now , researchers say they may have an answer - it was here all along			0
a new theory claims that giant underwater ' oceans ' of water is stored in porous rock			2
researchers at @entity12 believe the same amount of water that currently fills the @entity15 could be buried deep inside the planet right now - and that underground ' oceans ' or rock were created at the same time the earth was			1
@entity21 to the study is the idea that rocks that appear dry to the human eye can actually contain water — in the form of hydrogen atoms trapped inside natural voids and crystal defects			0
oxygen is plentiful in minerals , so when a mineral contains some hydrogen , certain chemical reactions can free the hydrogen to bond with the oxygen and make water			0
stray atoms of hydrogen could make up only a tiny fraction of mantle rock , the researchers explained			2
given that the mantle is more than 80 percent of the planet 's total volume , however , those stray atoms add up to a lot of potential water			1
researchers at @entity12 believe the same amount of water that currently fills the @entity15 could be buried deep inside the planet right now			1
the new study is helping to answer a longstanding question that has recently moved to the forefront of earth science : did our planet make its own water through geologic processes , or did water come to us via icy comets from the far reaches of the solar system ? the answer is likely ' both , ' according to the team , who are to present their work at the @entity67 ( @entity67 ) meeting in @entity69 tomorrow			0
they found a previously unknown geochemical pathway by which the @entity3 can sequester water in its interior for billions of years and still release small amounts to the surface via plate tectonics , feeding our oceans from within			1
' when we look into the origins of water on @entity3 , what we 're really asking is , why are we so different than all the other planets ? ' @entity78 , associate professor of earth sciences at @entity12 said			2
' in this solar system , @entity3 is unique because we have liquid water on the surface			0
' we 're also the only planet with active plate tectonics			0
' maybe this water in the mantle is key to plate tectonics , and that 's part of what makes @entity3 habitable			1

this plate tectonics diagramshows how mantle circulation delivers new rock to the crust via mid-ocean ridges			0
new research suggests that mantle circulation also delivers water to the oceans			0
in a lab at @entity12 , the researchers compress different minerals that are common to the mantle and subject them to high pressures and temperatures using a diamond anvil cell — a device that squeezes a tiny sample of material between two diamonds and heats it with a laser — to simulate conditions in the deep @entity3			1
they examine how the minerals ' crystal structures change as they are compressed , and use that information to gauge the minerals ' relative capacities for storing hydrogen			0
then , they extend their experimental results using computer calculations to uncover the geochemical processes that would enable these minerals to rise through the mantle to the surface — a necessary condition for water to escape into the oceans			0
where it is : researchers say the minerals called ringwoodite and wadsleyite can store water like a sponge , and reveals the @entity3 's transition zone could be a vast reservoir of water in a paper now submitted to a peer - reviewed academic journal , they reported their recent tests of the mineral bridgmanite , a high - pressure form of olivine			1
while bridgmanite is the most abundant mineral in the lower mantle , they found that it contains too little hydrogen to play an important role in @entity3 's water supply			1
another research group recently found that ringwoodite , another form of olivine , does contain enough hydrogen to make it a good candidate for deep - earth water storage			2
so @entity78 and @entity191 focused their study on the depth where ringwoodite is found — a place 325 - 500 miles below the surface that researchers call the ' transition zone ' — as the most likely region that can hold a planet 's worth of water			1
@entity203 holds the first terrestrial sample of ringwoodite ever found - which led to the discovery from there , the same convection of mantle rock that produces plate tectonics could carry the water to the surface			1
for the research presented at @entity67 , @entity78 and @entity191 performed new computer calculations of the geochemistry in the lowest portion of the mantle , some 500 miles deep and more			0
there , another mineral , garnet , emerged as a likely water - carrier — a go - between that could deliver some of the water from ringwoodite down into the otherwise dry lower mantle			2
if this scenario is accurate , the @entity3 may today hold half as much water in its depths as is currently flowing in oceans on the surface , @entity78 said — an amount that would approximately equal the volume of the @entity15			1
this water is continuously cycled through the transition zone as a result of plate tectonics			0
' if all of the @entity3 's water is on the surface , that gives us one interpretation of the water cycle , where we can think of water cycling from oceans into the atmosphere and into the groundwater over millions of years , ' she said			1
schematic partial cross section of the @entity3 showing the location of ringwoodite , which make up approximately 60 % by volume of this part of the transition zone			0
the diamond containing the water - bearing ringwoodite inclusion found by originated from approximately 500 km beneath the @entity3 's surface , where a large mass of water may accumulate by the subduction and recycling of oceanic lithosphere , into the transition zone			1
' but if mantle circulation is also part of the water cycle , the total cycle time for our planet 's water has to be billions of years			2
' earlier this year @entity271 researchers say analysis of a rare mineral points to the huge store of water deep in @entity3 's mantle , 400 - 600 kilometres ( 250 - 375 miles ) beneath our feet			1
it echoes the hundred and fifty year old novel , ' @entity280 ' , in which @entity284 science - fiction forerunner @entity282 pictured a vast sea that lay deep under our planet 's surface			2
the new theory , backed up by seismic data suggest that water is stored in the transition zone of @entity3 's mantle			1
it is thought to host minerals called ringwoodite and wadsleyite that can store water like a sponge			0
if water does exists in huge volumes beneath @entity3 's crust , it is bound to have a big impact on the mechanics of volcanoes and the movement of tectonic plates			1
the evidence comes from a water - loving mineral called ringwoodite that came from the so - called transition zone sandwiched between the upper and lower layers of @entity3 's mantle , they said in the journal @entity316			1
analysis shows that 1.5 % of the rock comprises molecules of water			1
the find backs once - contested theories that the transition zone , or at least significant parts of it , is water - rich , the investigators said			0
' this sample really provides extremely strong confirmation that there are local wet spots deep in the @entity3 in this area , ' said @entity203 of @entity271 's @entity332 , who led the research			2
' that particular zone in the @entity3 , the transition zone , might have as much water as all the world 's oceans put together			2
' the $ 20 diamond that led to the discovery : diamond sample @entity341 , from @entity343 , @entity344 , containing the hydrous ringwoodite inclusion			1
the rough diamond has been naturally sculptured to its unusual shape by corrosive mantle fluids during transport to the surface			0
@entity351 , a geologist at the @entity352 in @entity353 , cautioned against extrapolating the size of the subterranean water find from a single sample of ringwoodite			0
and he also said the water was likely to be locked up in specific rocks , in a molecular form called hydroxyl			0
' in some ways it is an ocean in @entity3 's interior , as visualised by @entity282 ... although not in the form of liquid water , ' @entity351 said in a commentary also published by @entity316			1
the implications of the discovery are profound , @entity203 suggested			0
if water exists in huge volumes beneath @entity3 's crust , it is bound to have a big impact on the mechanics of volcanoes and the movement of tectonic plates			1
' one of the reasons the @entity3 is such a dynamic planet is the presence of some water in its interior			2
water changes everything about the way a planet works , ' said @entity203 .			0

oceans believed to be 400 - 600 kilometres ( 250 - 375 miles ) beneath our feet
researchers say the same amount of water that currently fills the @entity15 could be buried deep inside the planet right now
1.5 percent of the rock analysed comprises molecules of water
first time researchers have ever found ringwoodite , a mineral in the @entity3 's mantle - after discovering it in a $ 20 diamond
researchers say discover could have a ' profound ' effect on our understanding on @entity3
