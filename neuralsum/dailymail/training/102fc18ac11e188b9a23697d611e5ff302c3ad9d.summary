thick scars coloured dull red and black cover the backs of women belonging to @entity9 's @entity8 tribe , the legacy of an initiation rite that sees them beaten bloody			1
no screaming is permitted by the men wielding the canes but the women do n't care			2
instead of fleeing , they beg the men to do it again and again until blood flows , dripping into the gritty red dust of the @entity19			1
now the @entity8 and their unique culture that merges the beautiful and the brutal in equal measure are the subject of a series of incredible photographs created by @entity29 lensman , @entity30			1
brutal : @entity8 women volunteer to be beaten by ' @entity32 ' ( initiated men ) during their brothers ' coming of age ceremonies			1
they show off their scars with pride tough girl : like their men , @entity8 women are expected to play a role in protecting the family cattle from rustlers and predatory wildlife patterned : both men and women have intricate designs carved into their skin using thorns ( left ) and share a love of colourful jewellery @entity30 travelled to @entity9 after spotting pictures of the @entity8 in a vintage book and hopes his photos will provide a record of a culture under threat from encroaching modernity			1
his striking images reveal the beauty of @entity8 women in their orange ochre make - up and bright beads , their skin scarred into intricate patterns using thorns , resilient as they live a life that 's precarious at best and brutal at worst			1
but not everything about the @entity8 is troubling			0
for the @entity8 , cattle are everything , and for the men , they form a key part of the rite that turns them from boy to man			2
at cattle jumping ceremonies , young men are required to leap across 15 cows , smeared with dung to make them slippery			0
if he fails , he can not marry and will be beaten by the watching women			0
at the same ceremony , his female relatives are beaten to create a blood debt between the man and his sisters who show off their scars with pride			0
homemakers : women take on all of the domestic chores as well as childcare and the lion 's share of sowing the sorghum crops the tribe needs to survive adornment : both men and women use orange make - up on their faces and bodies , in the men 's case with white paint in order to create a leopard - like effect @entity107 : wonderfully beaded and ochre painted @entity8 women dance themselves into a frenzy as they take part in a colourful ritual while their men look on out of shot pride : a @entity8 woman shows off her scars , including some recently inflicted ones			1
the three necklaces reveal that she is a high status first wife ' while the boys walk on cows , @entity8 women accompany him : they jump and sing , ' reveals @entity30 , who witnessed a ceremony			1
' the more abundant and extensive the initiate â€™s scars are , the deeper the girls ' affection is to the boy who is about to become a man			0
' @entity131 committed to their initiated sons , the mothers are whipped to blood , in order to prove their courage and accompany their sons during the test			0
' but for @entity8 women , beatings are not just part of an initiation ritual - they are daily life until at least two children have been born			1
under @entity8 rules , a man need not explain why he 's delivering a beating			2
it is his prerogative to mete out as he sees fit			0
men can also have more than one wife , with junior wives left to do the lion 's share of the planting and water gathering			2
' they do not have really the choice , ' says @entity30			0
' as [ with ] many women in @entity157 , they carry water , wood , take care of the food and the kids , while the men take care of the cows - the @entity8 treasure			1
' @entity8 men can have several wives , ' he adds			2
' the @entity8 women who are not a first wife have a really hard life and they are more slaves than wives			2
' [ but ] seeing those women with their animal skins , their special hairstyles , and their body covered with this orange make up was fascinating			0
' protection : this @entity8 girl 's battered old rifle contrasts starkly with her beauty and spectacular beaded necklace and headband work : @entity8 women are responsible for all domestic duties including fetching water , cooking , cleaning the home and looking after the children happy : two friends take a break from their back - breaking array of chores and farm work to share a joke and a smile together intricate : a @entity8 woman shows of her carefully braided hair and treasure trove of bright beads , shells and metal bangles despite the violence , @entity30 hopes that his photos will provide a record of a way of life that is slowly dying out			1
' i always take photographs for two reasons , ' he explains			0
' first , providing a testimony as many tribes are starting to disappear but also to show the world how other people live , even if some of the time they have shocking practices			0
' he tells the story of meeting a @entity8 boy who had walked for several days to a local town , just to see his favourite @entity221 football team on television			0
' this guy was wearing a @entity225 t - shirt , but still had to jump over ten bulls to be able to marry a girl in his tribe : a real culture shock			0
' they are all really into @entity225 , @entity232 , like many other @entity9 , who are just crazy about @entity234 football ' with more and more @entity8 swapping traditional life for @entity232 shirts , the days of beatings and cattle jumping would appear to be numbered			1
see more of @entity30 's work at @entity240 the majority of the 20,000 strong @entity8 people live in the @entity19 , a fertile part of the vast @entity244 , nationalities , and @entity245 of south - west @entity9 , which is bordered by @entity247 and @entity248			1
most still live in traditional villages , although growing numbers are migrating to the region 's cities and towns as well as the @entity9 capital , @entity255			2
cattle form the axis around which the @entity8 's world revolves , evidenced by the fact that there are 27 different words to describe the colour of a cow in the local language			2
men spend the majority of the time caring for the animals , which are also used to pay bride prices when the man takes a wife - always a woman from the @entity8 tribe - and generally amounts to 30 goats and 20 cows			1
cows also form part of the male initiation rite , which involves contenders attempting to leap over a row of 15 cows made extra slippery with dung			1
at the same ceremony , the man 's sisters and other female relatives are beaten bloody to create a blood debt so the man remembers to help them should they face tough times in the future			2
while cattle - leaping is relatively harmless , another practice , known as ' mingi ' is more troubling			0
' the @entity8 tribe still practises ritual infanticide , ' @entity30 explains			1
' if the first tooth appears in the upper jaw , instead of the lower , the child becomes what they called ' mingi ' - this applies also to the baby teeth and the adult teeth when the kids are seven or eight			0
' if a ' mingi ' child is kept in the village by the mother , elders believe droughts , famines and diseases will come in the community , so they kill the babies			0
most ' mingi ' children are left in the desert alone to die , although local charities now regularly check the area for abandoned children which are then raised in orphanages away from the tribe .			0

ceremonial beatings take place during the male initiation rites but also in the home when the *husband* chooses
ritual beatings are carried out by a group of men called ' @entity330 ' , continue until the women 's backs are left bloody
men and women from the @entity8 tribe use thorns to create intricate scar patterns which are considered beautiful
the @entity9 tribe were photographed by @entity30 who travelled to the remote @entity19 to meet them
