but this is so horrific			0
' ms @entity52 , who cares for 88 abandoned and neglected horses at @entity63 , said the allegations of animal cruelty are among the worst she 's heard			0
she said a few marks on the horse 's head suggest a halter or bridle was pulled too hard in the past , and marks on the horse 's back could mean a saddle was too tight			0
