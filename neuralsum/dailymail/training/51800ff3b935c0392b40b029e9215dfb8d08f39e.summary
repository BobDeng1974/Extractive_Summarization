by @entity1 reporter published : 11:14 est , 25 june 2013 updated : 17:42 est , 25 june 2013 in a major blow to civil rights activists , the @entity2 on tuesday struck down an important part of a 48 - year - old federal law designed to protect minority voters			1
the court ruled on a 5 - 4 vote in favor of officials from @entity12 , @entity13 , in finding that a section of the landmark @entity15 that sets the formula that determines which states need federal approval to change voting laws is invalid			1
the court , split on ideological lines , did not go as far as striking down @entity23 of the law , which required certain states , mainly in the @entity26 , to show that any proposed election - law change does not discriminate against black , @entity29 or other minority voters			0
although section 5 is technically left intact , it is effectively nullified , at least for the near future , as @entity46 would now need to pass new legislation setting a new formula before it can be applied again			0
as a result , the ruling is a heavy blow for civil rights advocates , who believe the loss of a working preclearance program could lead to an increase in attempts to deter minorities from voting			2
justice @entity58 , joined by her three liberal colleagues , dissented from tuesday 's ruling			0
@entity58 said no one doubts that voting discrimination still exists ' but the court today terminates the remedy that proved to be best suited to block that discrimination , ' she said in a dissent that she read aloud in the packed courtroom			0
the ruling on the @entity15 is one of the most closely - watched @entity2 disputes in the past year			1
seeing the racial issues : @entity73 representatives spoke out on the steps of the @entity2 protecting minorities : the @entity15 was in place to make sure that many voting locations in the @entity26 and places with a history of racial issues are not used in a discriminatory way the case centers on the civil rights - era law that broadly prohibited poll taxes , literacy tests and other measures that prevented blacks from voting			1
in the 1960s , such laws existed throughout the country but were more prevalent in the @entity26 with its legacy of slavery			2
the issue of voting rights remains prominent in the @entity95 as judges nationwide heard challenges to new voter identification laws and redrawn voting districts during the 2012 presidential election			0
the @entity102 administration , backed by civil rights advocates , had argued that the provision was still needed to deter voter discrimination			1
his issued a statement condemning the decision shortly after it was handed down			0
' i am deeply disappointed with the @entity2 ’s decision today , ' president @entity102 said in the release			1
breaking the news : the @entity15 is just one of the landmark decisions expected to come this week , as affirmative action was handed down yesterday and @entity116 is expected tomorrow ' today ’s decision invalidating one of its core provisions upsets decades of well - established practices that help make sure voting is fair , especially in places where voting discrimination has been historically prevalent			1
' as a nation , we ’ve made a great deal of progress towards guaranteeing every @entity95 the right to vote			0
but , as the @entity2 recognized , voting discrimination still exists			2
' just last week , the @entity2 struck down an @entity131 state law that required people registering to vote in federal elections to show proof of citizenship , a victory for activists who said it discouraged @entity139 and @entity140 from voting			2
@entity141 say that and similar measures , championed by @entity144 at the state level , were intended to make it more difficult for certain voters who tend to vote @entity141 to cast ballots .			0

president @entity102 *blasted* the ruling saying he was ' deeply disappointed '
@entity2 ruled that one section of the @entity15 does not need to be *maintained* because the country has changed since the laws were needed
*originally* put in place to make sure that minorities were *n't* targeted - and *pressured* not to vote - at polling places
