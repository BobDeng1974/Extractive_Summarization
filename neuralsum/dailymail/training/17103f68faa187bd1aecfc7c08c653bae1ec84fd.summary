by @entity0 published : 03:40 est , 24 september 2013 updated : 09:59 est , 24 september 2013 he was once the world 's fattest man weighing in at a staggering 70 stone and consuming a mammoth 20,000 calories a day			1
but it seems that after losing 48 stone following @entity9 surgery , it 's not just @entity11 's health that has a more promising outlook - his weight loss may have also boosted his love life			1
mr @entity11 has only known his new girlfriend @entity15 for a month and the pair are yet to meet , but already the 52 - year old claims that @entity18 is the love of his life			1
' i ca n't think about anyone else and nor can she			2
' the pair met online last month when @entity18 , of @entity41 , near @entity42 , @entity43 , saw a television documentary about mr @entity11 's extreme obesity - the result , he says , of overeating when a previous relationship ended			1
she was so touched by his plight that @entity18 got in touch via @entity51 keen to help mr @entity11 in his bid to get the @entity9 to pay for a second operation to rid him of layers of excess skin			1
mr @entity11 said : ' she watched my documentary and thought " i want to help to find this chap help "			1
' ' she did n't really think anything romantically to start with , she just wanted to help me find someone who will operate			2
' i was a bit cautious to start with but as soon as i met her on @entity63 i felt at ease			2
we talked for four - and - a - half hours			1
smitten : @entity11 talks to @entity15 over @entity63 and hopes that the pair will soon be able to meet love letters : a hand crafted that @entity11 has made to send to @entity15 new life : mr @entity11 first met miss mountain when she got in touch to help him in his quest to have a second operation to remove layers of excess skin ' i did n't know anything about her but we talked all about her life and how she wants to help me			1
' ' it was n't until the second conversation that i realised there was more there than just friends			0
' she felt the same and brought up the idea of us being boyfriend and girlfriend			0
' mr @entity11 says that he does n't go for looks and finds miss @entity94 's determined attitude particularly attractive			1
he said : ' i am more interested in the person rather than the physical side of things			1
' it was hard for me to accept to start with because part of me is still trapped in this loose skin and i find it hard to understand how anyone can see through that			0
' @entity11 ' we became really close friends and now we are boyfriend and girlfriend			1
' she really wants to come over and see me and i am just desperate to meet her face - to - face , i am so excited			1
' it is her personality , her drive and passion and she has a lovely smile that made me fall for her			0
' like me she is a very determined person , i really adore that quality in her			2
' it was hard for me to accept to start with because part of me is still trapped in this loose skin and i find it hard to understand how anyone can see through that			0
' we share the same ideas , interests , and outlook on life and she has made me look at life in a new way			0
' i 'm more determined than ever to get this operation and enjoy my life with her			0
' for a long time i could n't really see light at the end of the tunnel			0
new goal : @entity11 hopes to have another operation to help him remove layers of excess skin after his weight loss , with the help of @entity15 , right ' but since @entity15 's been in my life i 've got a whole new sense of worth and excitement			1
' mr @entity11 ballooned to his incredible size by eating ten times the amount needed by a normal man due to a compulsive eating disorder			1
he claimed his binge eating began in his 20s at the time of his father 's death and a deterioration in his mother 's health			0
mr @entity11 quit his job as a postman when his weight prevented him from completing his deliveries			1
as his weight soared he was left unable to stand or walk before finally becoming bed - ridden and being looked after full time by council carers			2
firefighters had to demolish the front wall of his former home so they could drive a fork lift truck inside to lift him out and put him into an ambulance when he needed a hernia operation in 2002			0
mr @entity11 was later given a purpose - built housing association home with extra wide doorways so he could move around			1
his care bill cost taxpayers an estimated £ 100,000 a year and is believed to have topped £ 1million			0
at the height of his food addiction , he was gorging an entire packet of bacon , four sausages and four eggs complete with bread and hash browns for breakfast			0
he would then eat quadruple portions of fish and chips along with two kebabs for lunch followed by a roast dinner , curries or pizza and more chips in the evening			0
