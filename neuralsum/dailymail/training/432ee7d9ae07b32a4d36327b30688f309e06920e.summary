auction website @entity0 is on alert to stop people making a profit by re-selling poppies from the @entity7 installation			1
the ceramic poppies created for the ' @entity10 ' art project have been so popular that all 888,246 of them have sold in advance for £ 25 each - raising money for armed forces charities in the process			1
but it has emerged that some of the ceramic poppies are being sold online for profit			0
the seller known as ' 2250leanne ' said in the description : ' please note delivery of this item is due late january , early february 2015 '			0
to add further insult the trader asked up £ 9.99 for postage - double the official website price			0
luckily website bosses spotted the dubious listings and removed them immediately			0
they have now put a system in place to automatically remove any such listings in the future			0
@entity0 bosses have put a system in place to prevent people from selling the ceramic poppies on the website an @entity0 spokesman said : ' we are not permitting resale of the limited edition @entity52 poppies on @entity0			1
' any listings attempting to sell these items will be cancelled before any sale takes place			0
' our marketplace is not an appropriate venue for the limited edition ceramic poppies in view of the significance of each individual poppy as a memorial to an individual @entity66 military fatality			1
' he also said ' pre-sale ' listings are not permitted on the site so the listings would have been removed in due course anyway			0
millions of people have flocked to see artist @entity74 ' remarkable installation at the @entity7 to mark the centenary of @entity66 's involvement in the @entity77			1
there will be 888,246 in place by november 11			0
the number represents each @entity66 military fatality during the @entity77			1
the poppies have been sold for £ 25 each , plus £ 5.95 for postage , and 10 per cent from each plus all net profits will be divided between six service charities ; the @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91			1
the poppies first appeared in august and were sold out by october 17			0
@entity93 walks through a mass of ceramic poppies which form part of the art installation a spokesman for the @entity86 said : ' the @entity86 works closely with @entity0 and have a dedicated @entity0 shop selling official poppy products			1
' we urge all members of the public using @entity0 to buy their poppy items , to do so directly from our store			0
' we strongly encourage anyone re-selling poppy items to donate to the @entity86 and advise buyers on @entity0 to look for the ' @entity0 for charity ' ribbon which identifies listings where a percentage of the sale will be donated to charity			1
' in this instance we are grateful that @entity0 have taken this decision to remove the listings and prevent people profiteering from charity campaigns			2
' a @entity121 spokesman said they have been in ongoing conversations with @entity0 to ensure the poppies are not sold on and they are also monitoring any other merchandise associated with the installation that appears on the marketplace website			2
artist @entity74 with one of his ceramic poppies @entity121 , which runs the @entity7 , has warned people on its website not to expect their poppies to be delivered until january or february next year due to the huge number they have to process			2
work to make the 888,246 ceramic poppies started in august last year and involved 400 people manufacturing them using 400 tons of clay			2
some 25,000 people have volunteered to help install the poppies at the @entity7 .			2
