it was the last formal photoshoot of legendary @entity2 frontman @entity1 , just months before his tragic suicide in april 1994			1
when the lead singer showed up to the shoot three hours late with a large pair of white @entity10 sunglasses , @entity5 photographer @entity4 recalls @entity1 politely and quietly asking him for a bucket			1
the 51 - year - old , who was shooting the rock band for a magazine feature at the time , said ‘ sure , but what for ? ’ @entity1 responded , ‘ cause i think i ’m gon na puke ’			2
now , 20 years after his death , the photographer will pay tribute to the music legend by exhibiting his exclusive collection , featuring photographs that have never before seen or printed in @entity22			1
so it ’ll be interesting because i do n't know what to expect , ’ he told @entity27			0
‘ but i ’m very excited because it 's going to be my first time in @entity22 and it ’s going to be a fun experience to share my photographs with @entity2 fans and photography lovers			1
' when asked whether he had a favourite photograph of @entity1 from the shoot , @entity4 said there were too many to choose from			2
‘ i have several favourites from the shoot – i reckon there 's equally four or five that i appreciate the most			0

@entity5 photographer @entity4 ( pictured ) will exhibit his exclusive collection of photographs of @entity1 and @entity2 in @entity22 for the first time the pictures were taken at the height of @entity2 ’s success during their @entity61 tour , while behind the scenes @entity1 continued to battle drug and alcohol addiction in 1993 , @entity2 was the biggest band in the world , and @entity1 was subject to an intense level of celebrity and public scrutiny ‘ i love the black and white – full length shot of him just standing there , holding a bottle in one hand and hanging his head to the side because it says everything – it 's intriguing and passionate and tells so much about his story			1
‘ the close - up shots of his head and shoulder – one in particular that looks like his brushing his teeth but he ’s smoking a cigarette – these photos captured the real moments of him that i love			0
‘ another picture i quite love is the one with his mouth open and he ’s looking up into the sky			0
' band members @entity95 and @entity97 arrived promptly at 11am when the shoot was scheduled over one day in november 1993 , but the lead singer was nowhere to be found			2
the shoot was scheduled to take five hours so @entity4 and his assistants quickly put together a makeshift studio in a small room at the @entity33 ’s @entity104 where the group was staying			2
‘ we only had 30 minutes to shoot the band in the studio and their rehearsal later that day but i wish i had more time to work with @entity1 , ’ @entity4 said			1
‘ but it was still a great experience and he was so easy to work with and i loved it because he was very nice , patient and attitude - free with the camera – he was never controlling			0
’ it was the last formal photo shoot @entity2 ever did before the songwriter took his own life at the age of 27 @entity4 and his assistants quickly put together a makeshift studio in a small room at the @entity33 hotel where the group was staying on april 5th 1994 , the singer - songwriter took his own life at the age of 27			1
‘ i was getting a lot of phone calls that day from my friends to tell me about the news , ’ @entity4 said			0
‘ it was really sad and i was shocked and the people who knew him well were shocked			0
‘ i knew he tried to commit suicide before but you do n’t think anyone would do it until they do			0
‘ it was shocking because he was one of the most well - known rockstars at the time so why would someone do that ? it was a real surprise			0
‘ it ’s always sad to see someone feel they have no hope and happiness in life , but it was his life and he chose to do it – he wanted to leave the world			0
