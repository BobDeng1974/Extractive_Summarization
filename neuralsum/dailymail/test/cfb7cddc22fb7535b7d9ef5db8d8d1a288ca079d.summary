@entity0 said he knows that when it comes to immigration , ' fears and worries ' remain let me reassure you , i know that when it comes to immigration , fears and worries remain			1
they were set out on the front page of this newspaper yesterday			2
and i want to set out exactly the choice before you on may 7			2
i am not one of those politicians who says they ‘ get ’ how people feel about immigration then speaks differently in private			1
sitting in the @entity18 from 2001 , i had a ringside seat on @entity21 ’s complete failure on immigration – and it was infuriating			1
fake colleges , bogus visas , wide open loopholes , the wrong welfare incentives , sham marriages , an abject failure to deport foreign criminals , migrants bringing family members to @entity33 even if they could n’t speak a word of @entity35 – a litany of failure			1
underpinning it all was contempt for the views of most @entity33 people			1
we all remember @entity44 ’s boast that @entity21 was practically ‘ sending out search parties ’ for migrants			1
the mess took 13 years to create – and over the past five years we have been working to turn this around			2
economic migration from outside the @entity50 has been capped at 20,700 skilled professionals a year			2
we have closed down over 850 of those bogus colleges that were basically visa factories			0
there are new charges for migrants using the @entity57 ; there is no social housing unless you ’ve been in an area for two years ; and there is no housing benefit full - stop for @entity50 jobseekers			1
critically , we now have proper exit checks at our borders so we know who is coming in and going out			0
on top of all this direct action to control immigration , we recognised that the rising immigration numbers were n’t just about lax borders and a system easily abused ; it was about @entity33 people not being trained to get into the jobs that were becoming available – or not incentivised to work at all , because of @entity21 ’s welfare system			1
so we have had a huge , unprecedented push on welfare and training , with two million young people starting apprenticeships , and vast numbers getting off welfare and into work			0
the result of all this ? consider these remarkable two facts			0
under @entity21 , for years , 90 per cent of job growth was taken up by foreign workers			1
with the @entity93 , two - thirds of our job growth now benefits @entity33 citizens			1
that is a remarkable turnaround			0
i ’m not saying there is n’t a lot more to do			0
it ’s clear that , as our economy has taken off , the bigger issue has become migration from within @entity104			0
and while we have not yet reduced net migration down to the tens of thousands each year , it remains the right ambition			0
so why have many more @entity50 migrants come here ? partly it ’s our extraordinary economic success , with @entity33 creating more jobs than 27 other @entity104 countries combined			1
but large numbers have also been drawn here because of incentives in things like tax credits and welfare			0
these have been a powerful draw to @entity50 workers			0
elect a @entity130 government , and i will start negotiating a new deal with @entity104 straight away			0
it will involve : no benefits at all for @entity50 jobseekers			1
if you have n’t got a job within six months , you ’ll be required to leave			1
if you ’ve got a job , you will get no in - work benefits until you ’ve been here and contributing to our country for at least four years			1
and no child benefit for children of @entity50 migrants living abroad – ever			0
this is what i ’m seeking			0
i will fight , negotiate , do all i can to secure a better deal for @entity33			1
and then we would put this to the @entity33 people in an in - out referendum in 2017			1
the capsizing of a boat full of migrants in the @entity157 at the weekend was absolutely shocking			0
eight hundred people died in the most horrific of circumstances , so it ’s also right that @entity33 – not just a compassionate country but a strong one too – does what it can to prevent such scenes from ever happening again			1
that ’s why i went to @entity164 yesterday to help deliver a response			0
of course , we need more search and rescue missions – and our @entity167 is ready to play its part alongside other navies			0
we need to hunt down the traffickers who prey on human misery , deal with the boats that bring people across the seas and help foster stable conditions in countries which export so much illegal immigration			1
only then will we properly get to grips with this situation – building confidence at home that people ca n’t come here illegally ; and helping people abroad life safe and secure lives			0
all of this is a serious , grown - up plan for reducing immigration long - term			1
and it is based on some straightforward values			0
immigration should be about welcoming those who can contribute to our country ; who want to come to @entity33 , pay their way , make a life here , and abide by @entity33 values			1
and this presents you with a clear choice on immigration on may 7			2
there can only be one prime minister in @entity207 , only one person ultimately responsible for controlling immigration : me , or @entity210			2
do you honestly think @entity210 cares about controlling immigration ? no. he was there the last time , remember , when net immigration increased five-fold			2
his arrogant refusal even to discuss numbers – let alone speak about any reduction – tells you all you need to know			0
but the facts of this election have changed – and it ’s even worse			0
the only way @entity210 can get into @entity221 is if he is propped up by the @entity222 – and they have made clear that they want higher levels of immigration			2
it ’s clear : @entity210 in @entity221 would increase immigration , not reduce it			2
and if you ’re someone considering voting @entity229 because you want a referendum on @entity104 and controlled immigration , remember that a vote for @entity229 makes it harder for @entity93 to win – and much more likely for @entity210 and the @entity222 to get into government			2
then you will get no referendum , and a return to uncontrolled immigration			2
so this is the choice			0
if i am prime minister after may 7 i will see through this serious , sustained attempt to control immigration long - term			1
i will get @entity33 a better deal in @entity104 – and i will give the @entity33 people the final say in an in - out referendum			1
if you want those things , there ’s only one way to get them : vote @entity130 on may 7 .			0

@entity0 said he knows that ' fear and worries ' remain over immigration
under @entity256 , two - thirds of @entity33 job growth now benefits @entity33 citizens
@entity44 said he will continue ' serious , sustained attempt ' to control immigration
