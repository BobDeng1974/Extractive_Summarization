by @entity0 published : 23:21 est , 21 january 2013 updated : 12:28 est , 22 january 2013 celebrity chef @entity1 has been forced to drop his campaign to encourage the nation to eat more mackerel - after it emerged that it is being over-fished			1
mackerel has become a firm favourite after a string of endorsements from celebrity chefs , including ‘ real food ’ champion @entity10			1
they have stressed its relatively cheap price tag and high levels of omega 3 oils - known to improve brain function			0
but consumers are now being told it is no longer a sustainable choice of fish			1
it has now been removed from the @entity32 ’s ‘ fish to eat ’ list , and instead should only be consumed occasionally , joining the likes of monkfish and plaice			1
after campaigning for the wider use of mackerel as part of his fish fight series , celebrity chef @entity1 says he will end his campaign to see the nation eating it regularly - including trying to convince fish and chip shops to sell mackerel in a bap or and will himself be using the fish more sparingly			1
last year , sales of smoked mackerel leapt by 20 per cent compared to 2011 at middle - class favourite @entity51			2
conservationists now fear stocks may be at risk after @entity56 and the @entity57 dramatically increased their quotas in recent years			0
in 2011 , 930,000 tonnes of mackerel were fished from the north - east @entity60 , but scientists claim the maximum that should be caught is 542,000 tonnes			2
over-fished : mackerel has become a firm favourite after a string of endorsements from celebrity chefs , including ' real food ' champion @entity1 - @entity1 fishing grounds : mackerel may seem plentiful in places , but it is fast disappearing from our shores reacting to the announcement that mackerel is at risk , @entity1 said : ‘ when we started the mac bap campaign two years ago , mackerel was certified as sustainable and part of a well - managed fishery			1
‘ unfortunately things have changed , and politics and greed are getting in the way of common sense			0
if the countries involved could agree sensible catch limits this could still be a certified sustainable fishery			0
‘ we hope that these so called mackerel wars can be laid to rest as soon as possible , so we can all go back to eating mackerel again with a clear conscience			2
’ in demand : in 2011 , 930,000 tonnes of mackerel were fished from the north - east @entity60 , but scientists claim the maximum that should be caught is 542,000 tonnes he promised to only use handline - caught mackerel , which is considered the most sustainable , in his @entity101 restaurants and cooking school			2
@entity104 - starred chef @entity103 described the plight of mackerel as ‘ horrible ’ adding that its decline is ‘ clearly is an example of the failure of politics ’			0
@entity112 , fisheries officer at the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) , said good alternatives to mackerel - worth £ 205 million to the @entity114 fishing industry in 2011 - are herring and sardine			1
‘ @entity56 and the @entity57 have unilaterally decided to take a larger share than before			0
as a result , there is a real potential for overfishing , ’ she said			0
mackerel may well be a victim of its own success following campaigns to encourage people to switch to the fish			1
‘ people are more aware that eating fish can boost their health , and particularly oily types like mackerel , ’ said miss @entity112			1
‘ and @entity1 and the mackerel bap has certainly contributed to its popularity			1
’ a @entity138 spokesperson said : ' the continued sustainability of mackerel is vitally important and is increasingly threatened by the actions of the @entity57 and @entity56			0
' we are extremely concerned that an agreement on fishing rights has not yet been reached			0
' that is why the @entity114 continues to seek a new agreement that is fair to all			0
' other fish taken off the ‘ fish to eat ’ list is gurnard and pollock - a white fish once championed as a sustainable alternative to cod. both species have increased in popularity , while there is a lack of data on population levels and concerns about how stocks are being managed			1
saddened : @entity104 - starred chef @entity103 said the plight of mackerel is ' horrible ' adding its decline is ' clearly is an example of the failure of politics ' @entity169 , which has been historically caught accidentally as ‘ bycatch ’ , has become fashionable in restaurants in recent years , with its sustainable virtues praised by celebrity chefs			0
but with increased consumption and up to 50 per cent of the catch discarded by fishermen , scientists fear it could soon be at risk			0
to add to the confusion , despite concerns over cod and haddock stocks , they are on the ‘ fish to eat ’ list if they come from areas where numbers are sustainable			1
‘ it is difficult for the consumer because a lot of the supermarket labeling is inadequate for them to make a properly informed choice			0
the advice is to check where the fish comes from if possible , ’ said the @entity189			0
the latest version of the ‘ fish to eat ' list shows that herring stocks , coley and @entity205 sole from the @entity206 are all good to eat with a clear conscience			1
@entity208 from the @entity209 also appears on the list for the first time , while a number of other popular wild fish are given the green light to appear on the dinner plate , including lemon sole			2
and farmed species are on the list , including organic @entity219 , sturgeon caviar from closed fish farming systems , mussels , tiger prawns , @entity60 halibut and salmon and rainbow trout .			2

@entity1 will no longer champion the oily fish
mackerel is taken off the @entity32 *'s* ' fish to eat ' list
