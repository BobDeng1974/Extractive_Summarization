@entity0 , the comic who was slammed as ' disgusting ' for making a joke that @entity3 veterans are so old they are only able to chew @entity4 during @entity7 's @entity6 coverage , says she is not sorry for the jab that created controversy for the tv network			1
the 31 - year - old comedian angered some audience members during @entity7 's ' @entity13 ' when she made an offhand remark in regard to a tasteless tweet that @entity4 had posted on @entity17			1
' i mean , it sucks that the only survivors of @entity21 are being mocked by the only food they can still chew , ' @entity0 quipped			1
deluged in angry tweets , most of which ca n't be published , @entity0 responded in a post on her blog on friday , reported the @entity28			1
' i 'm not sorry , ' she wrote			0
. cruel : @entity0 , right , appeared on @entity31 's @entity6 show and joked that @entity21 survivors are now so old they can only eat @entity4 because they 're soft ' i do n't think the amazing courage of @entity35 veterans and specifically those who survived @entity21 is in any way diminished by a comedian making a joke about dentures on television			1
' ' do we really believe that the people who fought an defended our freedom against @entity45 an the @entity42 will find a joke about @entity4 's too much to bear ? sorry , i have more respect for veterans than to think their honor can be impugned by a glamorous , charming comedian in a fur hat			1
' @entity0 pointed to issues with care of veterans as a larger issue than her remark			2
' on the one hand you have me , making a joke about how old people ca n't chew tough foods very well , ' she wrote			2
' on the other hand you have veterans who receive inadequate care upon their return from active duty , rampant sexual assault against female soldiers , staggering rates of suicide , traumatic brain injury , ptsd , substance abuse and depression among soldiers and political gridlock that prevents these problems from getting solved quickly			0
' ' where do you think your outrage and action would be better served , calling me a c - t or doing something about the above problem ? ' @entity0 concluded			0
the drama started when @entity85 tweeted a pictured of their mascot holding an @entity35 flag and asking people to ' take a moment to remember # @entity92 with us ' - which some saw as a tasteless marketing ploy			0
oops : @entity0 's comment came as the guests spoke about an insensitive tweet that @entity4 had sent out on @entity17 ' it offended a lot of people , corporations glomming on to , you know , sentimental @entity35 historic traditions , seemingly looking for people in business			1
but you were offended for another reason , ' @entity31 said			0
' i 'm offended because they were referring to @entity4 as pasta , ' said @entity113			0
@entity0 then added : ' it sucks that the only survivors of @entity21 are being mocked by the only food they can still chew			1
' after @entity0 mocked the veterans , @entity117 whooped with laughter - and could n't stop			1
as the segment aired , viewers were not impressed			0
' @entity0 just made a joke about the @entity125 tweet that was probably more offensive than the tweet itself , ' one viewer wrote on @entity128			2
' making fun of @entity21 vets ? changing channel			0
really @entity7 ? ' another said			0
one other viewer added on the network 's @entity135 page : ' shame on you , @entity7 , for making fun of the @entity3 vets			0
' attack : after @entity0 , pictured , made the comment , viewers slammed @entity7 across social networking sites having a laugh : the other guests , especially actor @entity117 , left , found her comment hilarious			2
glee favorite @entity113 said what she found more offensive was @entity4 being deemed ' a pasta ' after @entity4 ' insensitive tweet last month , the company issued an apology			1
' we apologize for our recent tweet in remembrance of @entity17 , ' it wrote on its @entity128 account			2
' we meant to pay respect , not to offend			0

@entity31 was *speaking* with guests on his @entity13 show about an insensitive tweet @entity4 sent out on @entity17
*comedienne* @entity0 said : ' it sucks that the only survivors of @entity21 are being mocked by the only food they can still chew '
@entity0 has responded to the controversy , saying she will not give an ' *insincere* apology ' but wants people to *donate* to a *war* veterans charity
