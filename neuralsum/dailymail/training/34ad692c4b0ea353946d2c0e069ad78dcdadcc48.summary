as 29,000 teachers and support staff paraded the city 's streets on sunday , placards in toe , delegates pledged to maintain their destructive efforts because they want to consult with rank - and - file members before voting to end the walk out			2
their decision defies mayor @entity23 who said he would seek a court order to end the strike , as it is illegal under state law			1
teachers went out on strike on september 10 over @entity4 mayor @entity23 's demand for education reforms			1
see you in court ! @entity4 mayor @entity23 is threatening to sue the striking teachers teachers and their allies packed a city park saturday in a boisterous show of force as union leaders and the district tried to work out the details of an agreement that could end a week - long walkout			1
pushing strollers , toting signs and towing wagons of children , thousands of red - shirted teachers cheered and chanted as speaker after speaker urged them to stand firm until they have a deal in writing			1
they told the teachers that their strike was a symbol of hope for public teachers and other unions that have been losing ground around the nation			2
' i 'm pretty confident that something will come together that both sides will agree on , ' said @entity83 , a sixth - grade math teacher			2
' i believe this is a very strong turning point when you have so many people coming out to fight alongside ( the teachers union )			2
' months of contract negotiations came down to two main issues : job security and union opposition to a new teacher evaluation process the union felt was too heavily weighted on student test scores			1
@entity33 leaders who announced a framework for a deal on friday said they would not end the strike - the first in @entity4 in 25 years - until they see a proposal in writing			1
raging mad : striking @entity4 school teachers march after a rally saturday , wearing posters and carrying signs riled up : @entity35 , president of the @entity33 addresses the crowd during a rally stand strong : @entity111 cautioned that ' we are on strike ' and that classes wo n't resume until the delegates see an agreement they can support saturday 's talks were aimed at settling on the exact language , and both sides were hopeful that the nearly 800 - member @entity120 could vote sunday to suspend the strike so children could be back in class on monday			1
addressing demonstrators saturday , @entity111 cautioned that ' we are on strike ' and that classes wo n't resume until the delegates see an agreement they can support			0

the mission : months of negotiations came down to two main issues : job security and union opposition to a new teacher evaluation process the union felt was too heavily weighted on test scores go get it : residents of a west side @entity4 neighborhood cheer public school teachers as they march after the rally ' our mission is very clear : we fight for equal , high - quality public education for all , ' @entity129 said			1

' we 're going to go in today and hammer ( out ) the details			0
' @entity33 members from @entity192 , @entity193 and elsewhere joined saturday 's rally in show of solidarity			0
for @entity192 teachers , the rally also served as a moment to celebrate a judge 's friday ruling striking down nearly all of a contentious state law championed by @entity204 gov. @entity204 that had effectively ended collective bargaining rights for most public workers			0
raging mad : a young boy , left , and a woman , right , hold signs critical of @entity4 mayor @entity23 @entity204 's administration immediately vowed to appeal , while unions , which have vigorously fought the law , declared victory			1
' people are energized by this , ' said @entity218 a high school social studies teacher from @entity220 who came to the rally with a busload of others			0
' i think that the line has to be drawn in terms of teacher bashing , union bashing and privatization of education			0
these forces and factors are not just in @entity4 , not just in @entity192 , but across the nation and ( @entity4 ) happens to be the spear point			0
' mayor @entity23 , who has blasted the union for engaging in a ' strike of choice , ' sounded optimistic friday , saying ' the tentative framework is an honest and principled compromise that is about who we all work for : the students			1
