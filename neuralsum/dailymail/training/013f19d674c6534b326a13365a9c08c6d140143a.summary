last night mrs @entity6 , 29 , said she feels marooned in a foreign country and added : ‘ i do n’t know how a court can believe it is better for such young children to be with their father instead of their mother			1

after they separated and started a custody battle over the children , dr @entity6 , 33 , unsuccessfully attempted to have his wife sectioned			1

’ mrs @entity6 , who read @entity94 at @entity95 , met her future husband on a trip to @entity98 in 2006			2
she said : ‘ it all seemed very romantic and a big adventure , but the marriage was terrible from the beginning			0
