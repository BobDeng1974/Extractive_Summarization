inflammatory language : @entity1 , foreign minister of @entity2 the glamorous foreign minister of a breakaway region of @entity5 is calling on @entity6 to make her country his next conquest in eastern @entity9			1
few may have heard of @entity2 , the unofficial and fictitious - sounding statelet whose head of international relations is 36 - year - old @entity1			1
however , senior @entity15 figures are alarmed that following the annexation of @entity18 it is step two in a @entity20 masterplan to redraw the frontiers of @entity9			0
this top diplomat in staunchly @entity2 , who has a penchant for revealing black dresses , is gushing in her praise of @entity6 's takeover of the @entity29 peninsula			1
she openly invites him to make the same move in her landlocked territory of 509,000 people , wedged between strife - torn @entity34 and @entity5			0
' we are pleased to say that the outcome of the @entity18 referendum almost fully coincides with the results of the @entity41 referendum of 17 september 2006 , when over 97 per cent of voters chose independence and the prospect of voluntary unification with @entity46 , ' she said in a statement			0
' the obvious match of the will expressed by people in @entity18 and @entity2 demonstrates that the @entity46 world is uniting and the people 's wish for unity can not be stopped			1
' @entity46 troops are assembling on @entity34 â€™s eastern border with @entity46			0
an annexation of @entity2 would be a significant expansion of @entity46 territory			1
a @entity46 force of 1,300 troops - currently on high alert - is already on the ground as ' peacekeepers ' in the self - declared state - which boasts the hammer and sickle on its mainly red flag			2
last week there were reports of plain - clothed @entity46 @entity72 secret services agents flooding into breakaway territory			1
@entity1 , whose striking looks have been compared to a fashion model @entity46 president @entity6 signs bills making @entity18 part of @entity46 in the @entity20 in @entity78 under international law , the unofficial country is part of @entity84 - speaking @entity5 , but after a war as the @entity85 broke up , ms @entity1 and the local population have never accepted rule by @entity5			1
they are now bent on being formally integrated as a region of the @entity20 , which has long subsidised this outpost			0
the fear for @entity15 military planners is that after taking @entity2 , @entity6 could then seize an arc from there to @entity18 , sealing off the southern @entity29 regions of @entity34			0
in the process , he would grab another old @entity46 jewel , the port city of @entity98 , and cripple @entity100 's economy			2
the 36 - year - old mother of one said : ' the @entity46 world is uniting and the people 's wish for unity can not be stopped ' @entity1 's inflammatory call , combined with more pro-russian protests in @entity34 cities , provoked fresh fears that @entity6 plans to seize more slices of eastern @entity9 following his annexation of @entity18 ' unity and integration , as shown by today 's realities , are not always associated with geography , ' explained mother - of - one ms @entity1 in the district 's capital @entity120			1
' we are a striking confirmation of this fact			0
we consider ourselves part of the @entity46 world			0
we do not separate ourselves from the @entity46 and @entity46 civilization			0
' we consider ourselves part of @entity46 , and not without reason			0
this has legal and historical background			0
' @entity2 was originally seized by @entity46 in 1792 under @entity131 but is today a @entity85 timewarp with @entity134 statues and military checkpoints			2
like many others , ms @entity1 can not use her @entity41 passport to travel and instead relies on her @entity46 citizenship , for example when travelling to @entity78 to complete her doctorate in international relations			2
@entity1 is the foreign minister of @entity2 , a mainly @entity46 - speaking region leading @entity145 voices including former @entity147 presidential candidate @entity146 and @entity149 @entity148 have warned about the risk to @entity15 interests in a @entity6 takeover			1
' now that we 've had a crash course on @entity18 , read ahead about @entity2 , a likely target for @entity6 's next move , ' warned @entity157 , a former @entity145 diplomat who is president of the @entity158			2
in @entity78 , powerful deputy premier @entity159 - hit last week by @entity15 sanctions - has been put in charge of @entity46 's response on @entity2 amid complaints from locals that they are being blockaded by both @entity34 and @entity5 the local pleas could become a pretext for @entity78 's intervention fronted - @entity18 - style - by local self - defence squads .			1
