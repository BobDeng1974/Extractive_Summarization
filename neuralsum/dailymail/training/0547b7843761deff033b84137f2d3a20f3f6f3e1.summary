finally , @entity0 have had a happy monday			1
after 12 years and 21 games , they won a match on a monday , clinching a vital win against @entity5			2
but while @entity6 enjoyed his start to the week , the same ca n’t be said of @entity8			2
the @entity5 boss left incensed after referee @entity10 failed to award his side what looked a clear penalty inside the opening 25 seconds			1

and he may find himself in further trouble after another rant after last night ’s loss			0
‘ i think everyone knows it was a penalty , i think the only chance we ’ve got of getting a penalty at the moment is if a player picks up the ball and throws it at the referee , ’ said the @entity5 boss			2
‘ we are at @entity96 next , i do n’t think we ’ll get many decisions there			0
@entity100 decisions change games and major decisions have n’t gone for us			0
’ there ’s no doubt about it , @entity0 got away with one , and @entity6 knew it too			1
‘ it was time for us to get a little bit of luck , ’ said the @entity0 boss			2
‘ we ’ve not had much so far this way			0
what ’s important is that we take advantage of that luck and win the game			0
‘ it means a lot — it means more than anyone can think			0
it ’s been a difficult couple of weeks			0
’ spectators were still finding their seats as the night ’s main talking point unfolded			2
there looked to be no danger as @entity46 flicked on @entity39 ’s hoist forward , but as @entity0 hesitated in dealing with the second ball , @entity45 burst past @entity128 into the box			1
@entity61 lunged but failed to make any contact with the ball before taking @entity45 ’s legs away from him			0
@entity132 rose to its feet fully expecting a penalty , but @entity10 waved @entity5 ’s appeals away			2
@entity8 was less than impressed			0
you can only wonder how he felt when he saw the replays			0
it was as clear a penalty as you ’ll see this season			0
in the aftermath , the @entity5 boss approached fourth official @entity144			1
not long after , @entity10 made his way over to the @entity5 bench for a word with @entity8			2
having conceded 10 goals in their last two games , @entity6 would have been content to see his side on level terms after 30 @entity153 ’d have been ecstatic three minutes later as @entity0 took the lead			1
@entity45 goes down in the box under a challenge by @entity61 but the home side 's penalty appeals were turned down palace manager @entity8 was unhappy with the decision not to award a penalty and made his feelings known to @entity10 @entity5 's @entity162 back heels the ball into the danger area which lead to @entity55 turning the ball into his own net @entity55 watches as he inadvertently directs the ball past his own keeper to level the score at @entity132 @entity169 in the @entity0 goal can do nothing as the ball is sent past him by his team - mate @entity55 @entity55 watches as the ball nestles in the back of the net to draw @entity5 level against @entity0 @entity58 and @entity55 hold an inquest over the own goal that brought @entity5 level against their relegation rivals there was a hint of offside as @entity184 collected the ball down the left — but as @entity5 appealed for a free - kick the @entity186 found @entity20 , who leaped highest to plant a header past @entity35			1
@entity5 had a second penalty appeal dismissed by @entity10 two minutes after @entity20 ’s goal when @entity62 collided with @entity190 down the right			1
again , the @entity0 player made little or no contact with the ball			2
if @entity8 was angry at his side ’s first failed penalty shout , he was apoplectic with this one			0
but in @entity10 ’s defence , replays showed that the tangle occurred just outside the box			0
the incident was @entity62 ’s final contribution , as he was carried off after lengthy treatment following the collision with @entity41			0
@entity5 ’s predicament could easily have worsened before the break as the @entity0 were denied three times by @entity35 ; @entity20 , @entity61 and @entity67 all denied by the @entity208			1
@entity20 heads home the opening goal for @entity0 at @entity5 in the first half at @entity132 @entity211 striker @entity20 peels away after his stunning header put the @entity0 in front against @entity8 's side @entity20 takes the plaudits from the crowd as he ensured @entity0 went into the break with a narrow lead in @entity219 @entity20 is joined by his @entity0 team - mates as they celebrate the opening goal in front of their travelling support @entity224 miles @entity5 113.1 70.3 @entity43 90 11.4 7.1 @entity36 90 11.1 6.9 @entity190 90 11.0 6.9 @entity0 116.2 72.2 @entity225 90 12.0 7.5 @entity63 90 11.7 7.3 @entity64 90 11.2 7.0 ten minutes into the second half , @entity5 grabbed a deserved equaliser			1
@entity41 was at the centre of it , tormenting @entity63 before standing up an inviting cross to @entity45 at the far post			0
the former @entity0 striker ’s powerful header was brilliantly saved by @entity58 , but the keeper was helpless as @entity55 diverted @entity45 ’s back - heel from the rebound into his own net from two yards			1
but having dragged themselves back into the clash , @entity5 slumped to defeat after a miserable final 10 minutes			1
@entity25 smashed home a 20 - yard drive in the 79th minute to send the travelling support into delirium , @entity42 heaped further misery on the home side as he was sent off for a second yellow card for a foul on @entity25 before @entity20 , put clear by @entity66 , added a third			1
@entity0 's @entity184 is taken off on a stretcher and was replaced by @entity55 for the visitors @entity5 fans protest at the perceived greed of the @entity252 during their monday night clash with @entity0 palace fans also protested about a potential 38th game being played abroad as they watched their side take on @entity0 stewards closed in quickly on those who unfurled the banner , the group is known as the @entity261 @entity5 captain @entity42 was shown a second yellow card for a challenge on @entity25 late in the match @entity42 is shown his marching orders to compound @entity5 's misery on a night they were well beaten by @entity0			1

@entity55 looked to have earned @entity5 a point with @entity0 's fourth own goal of the season
but @entity25 fired home with a little over 10 minutes to go and @entity20 added a third
@entity20 had earlier opened the scoring for @entity6 's side with a well - placed header in the first half
@entity5 's misery was compounded when captain @entity42 was sent off with five minutes to go
