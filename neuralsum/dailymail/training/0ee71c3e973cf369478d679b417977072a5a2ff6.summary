@entity8 , 86 , was placed on an antibiotic drip at @entity32 in @entity33 , pictured , but was found collapsed with a pool of blood by his bedside two hours later after the drip became detached the inquest in @entity41 heard that bachelor mr @entity8 , from @entity42 , was admitted to the hospital on january 28 suffering from diarrhoea and was place in a single room to prevent any infection from spreading			1
mr @entity8 also had several pre-existing medical conditions , including heart disease plus pancreatitis and cirrhosis of the liver thought to have been the result of the weekly bottle of rum added to his coffee			2
on the night before he died , staff nurse @entity58 said mr @entity8 was struggling to sleep , pressing his call button every half hour			1
she said : ' he was frustrated and irritated			0
he could n’t sleep and was angry about being in a side ward			0
' she last checked on mr @entity8 at 6.35am on february 17 when she set up a new antibiotic drip , handing over to the day shift at 7.30am			1

while mr @entity8 was left unsupervised for two hours , the inquest was told that patients with cannulas are usually only observed every four hours			0
the court heard how the drip tube was connected to the cannula ’s three way tap by a single threaded screw which could easily be undone			0
deputy coroner @entity97 ruled that mr @entity8 would not have deliberately tried to harm himself but added that he did not believe the drip had been incorrectly set up			2
giving a narrative verdict , mr @entity97 said that mr @entity8 ' died as a consequence of the accidental detachment of a giving set ( drip tube apparatus ) used to administer intravenous antibiotics from a three way tap connected to a cannula inserted into an arm vein against a background of naturally occurring and alcohol related disease			2
' speaking after the hearing mr @entity8 ’s nephew , @entity110 , said he accepted the coroner ’s finding but was critical of the way his uncle was treated at the hospital before his death			2
he stressed that the pensioner , who had been a vegan since his early 20s and taught himself several languages , lost a lot of weight as a result of his false teeth being lost just hours after his admission and claimed that requests for his food to be liquidized were ignored .			0
