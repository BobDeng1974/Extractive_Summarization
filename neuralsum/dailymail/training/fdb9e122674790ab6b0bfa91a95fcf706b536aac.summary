@entity1 has found people who have a realistic sense of optimism are more likely to be happy and successful than people who are pessimistic or wildly optimistic			0
the psychology researcher believes realistic optimists ' positive outlook , combined with their rational perspective on life tend to be very successful			1
a realistic optimist is defined as someone who looks on the bright side of life but has a realistic grasp on the present and what to expect in life			1
she said realistic optimists use their realism to perform well at work and in exams , while their positive outlook enables them to dodge periods of depression and helps them spot opportunities			1
ms @entity1 , an organisational psychology researcher at @entity34 , shared her findings at a meeting of the @entity37 in @entity38 this month			1
while past research has shown optimists value thoughts that make them feel good , pessimists have a more ' truthful ' view of themselves and a realistic view can sometimes lead natural pessimists to suffering depression , @entity39 reported			0
another study concluded that optimists tend be in better health and live longer			0
however , ms @entity1 noticed that some people were both optimistic and realistic as well as being very successful , leading her to question whether a sense of optimism and pessimism are in opposition to one another			0
she questioned 200 college and graduate students about the ' positive illusions ' they held as well as whether they were motivated by reality or becoming a better person			0
realistic optimists got better grades than their more aspirational peers , perhaps suggesting that those lacking a realistic outlook deluded themselves they could do well without working hard , according to the study ms @entity1 found optimists could be divided into idealists and realists			1
she said : ' realistic optimists tend to choose accuracy over self - enhancement ; the unrealistic optimists tend to choose self - enhancement			1
' the realistic optimists got better grades than their more forward - thinking aspirational peers , perhaps suggesting those lacking a realistic outlook deluded themselves they could do well without working hard , ms @entity1 said			2
her study challenges conventional beliefs that a realistic outlook goes hand - in - hand with greater depression and instead shows realistic optimists are happy people			2
ms @entity1 thinks this might be the case as realistic optimists believe they have more control over themselves and their destinies , including in relationships and at work			2
the research suggests realistic and unrealistic optimists might have very different personality types			1
ms @entity1 thinks this might be the case because realistic optimists think they have more control over themselves and their destinies , including in relationships and at work she said : ' every time they face an issue or a challenge or a problem , they wo n't say " i have no choice and this is the only thing i can do			0
" they will be creative , they will have a plan a , plan b and plan @entity106 ' the psychology researcher said their balanced outlook allows optimistic realists to stay upbeat about the future , while recognising and overcoming present challenges			2
however , ms @entity1 warned people with this personality type are more prone to anxiety than more unrealistic people , probably because they recognise the chance of failure			0
the research also suggests that realistic and unrealistic optimists might have very different personality types .			1
