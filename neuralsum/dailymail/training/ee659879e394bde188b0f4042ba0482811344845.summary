it is caused by an amoeba that implants itself in its victim 's brains - usually when infected water shoots up their noses			2
the amoeba needs very specific conditions to thrive			0
it grows in the sediment at the bottom of pools of warm , stagnant water and is most active at about 85 degrees			2
the water must reach a relatively high temperature for the parasites to reach numbers that threaten humans			2
health officials have recorded only 125 instances of the disease in the @entity9 in the last 50 years			0
only one person has survived in the @entity9			0
one other survivor was found in @entity175 health officials say swimmers can reduce their risks even further by keeping their heads above water ; using nose clips or holding the nose shut when the head is submerged ; avoid stirring up sediment in shallow areas			2
