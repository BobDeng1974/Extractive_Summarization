hospital are to carry out @entity2 drills this weekend to ensure they are well prepared to deal with infected patients			2
simulation exercises are taking place in at least two major trusts – one in the north , one in the south – although others may be instructed to follow suit			1
at each , an actor will pretend to be a patient struck down with the virus and staff will have to act quickly to ensure it does n’t spread			1
yesterday @entity19 units across the country were given guidelines telling them to have specialist protective clothing on standby including masks , goggles and gowns			1
yesterday @entity19 units across the @entity27 were given guidelines telling them to have specialist protective clothing on standby including masks , goggles and gowns in case of an @entity2 outbreak			1
pictured , @entity36 nurses in protective clothing preparing bodies of victims of @entity2 for burial in the isolation unit of a hospital in @entity43 the drills will likely take place at a hospital with a specialist infectious disease department , such as the @entity48 in @entity49 ( pictured ) yet staff at some hospitals say they have n’t yet received these even though they should have been delivered within the past few months			1
as part of the drills , the mock patient will turn up at a @entity57 surgery or an @entity19 unit with mock early symptoms including a fever , muscle ache and sickness			1
doctors are meant to ask ‘ have you travelled recently ? ’ and if the patient has been to countries such as @entity66 , @entity67 or @entity36 – immediately suspect they have @entity2			1
@entity69 will quickly put on protective clothing and the patient will be taken by ambulance to the hospital where the drill is taking place			1
once they have been dropped off , the ambulance will be thoroughly decontaminated with a powerful chemical called hypochlorite – comprised of chlorine and oxygen all staff across the trust will have been warned beforehand that the drill is taking place by email and text alerts			2
but many may only get a few hours ’ notice – especially those working on other wards or in the canteen who wo n't be directly involved			0
as part of the drills , the mock patient will turn up at a @entity57 surgery or an @entity19 unit with mock early symptoms including a fever , muscle ache and sickness			1
several paramedics wearing protective suits as they move @entity101 missionary @entity100 , who later died from @entity2 health workers in @entity103 , @entity104 , outside the hospital where the @entity27 man died of what is believed to be @entity2 the @entity2 outbreak has killed thousands in @entity109 and has spread to @entity110 and @entity111 patients and relatives will also be informed that an exercise is under way – although they may not necessarily say that it is an ‘ @entity2 drill ’ just in case it creates a sense of panic			2
the @entity120 – which is overseeing the drills – will not to disclose which hospitals they are taking place so as not to alarm the public and to keep it as realistic as possible			0
but they will most probably take place at one of four which has a specialist infectious disease department			1
these include the @entity48 in @entity49 , the @entity130 , the @entity131 in @entity132 and the @entity133 in @entity134			0
throughout the drill , officials will be checking that staff are taking all the appropriate steps to prevent the spread of the virus – and minimise panic amongst the general public			0
the patient will be transferred to a make - shift isolation unit which will involve a tent being set up around the bed to contain the infection , whilst still enabling the patient to breath			1
the @entity48 has the country ’s only high level isolation unit – with just two beds – and air is specially filtered to prevent the spread of the infection			0
writing for the @entity156 , @entity157 , the director of the @entity158 a the @entity159 , said those experts are loath to discuss their concerns in public , for fear of whipping up hysteria			0
discussing the possible future course of the current outbreak , he said : ' the second possibility is one that virologists are loath to discuss openly but are definitely considering in private : that an ebola virus could mutate to become transmissible through the air			0
' but the chair of the @entity27 's @entity171 , professor @entity172 of the @entity173 , said it is impossible to predict how any virus will mutate			0
he said scientists across the world do not know enough about genetics to be able to say how the ebola virus will change over time			0
pointing to the example of the @entity182 influenza virus that saw bird flu sweep the globe in 2009 , dr @entity157 said : ' if certain mutations occurred , it would mean that just breathing would put one at risk of contracting @entity2			0
' but professor @entity172 , told @entity190 : ' no one can predict what will happen with the mutation of the virus			2
' i would like to see the evidence that this could become a respiratory virus			0
' the virus 's epidemiology is consistent with transmission via bodily secretions and excretions , which is exactly the same as other past epidemics			0
but last month three other trusts , the @entity130 , the @entity131 and the @entity133 were instructed to make contingency plans in case there was a sudden surge of patients			2
these are likely to have included setting up make - shift isolation units			1
public health officials in the nearby area will also work out how best to alert members of the public who may have come into contact with the patient without causing mass panic			2
ministers agreed to carry out the drills during wednesday ’s @entity221 chaired by @entity222			0
the exact details are still being finalised by the @entity120 including at how many trusts they will take place and on which day , saturday or sunday .			2
