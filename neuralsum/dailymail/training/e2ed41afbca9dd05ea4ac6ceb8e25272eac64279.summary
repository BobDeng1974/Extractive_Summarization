by @entity0 a father has relived the moment he was forced to make the agonising decision to either save the life of his pregnant wife or his unborn child			1
faced with such a terrible choice , doctors offered @entity9 one other option - to move them both to @entity12 's @entity11 for specialist treatment , but warned him there was only a 50 - 50 chance of either of them surviving			0
he took the second option and thanks to the amazing care of doctors - and the fact little @entity21 , now eight , was a ' born little fighter ' , both of his loved ones lived			1
a father has relived the moment he was forced to make a heartbreaking decision to save his unborn child or his wife the couple 's nightmare began in january 2006 when @entity33 awoke feeling ' a bit off '			1
unbeknownst to her , she was suffering from eclampsia			0
they decided to drive to the hospital as a precaution but in a matter of seconds , mrs @entity33 started screaming in agony in the car			0
when they arrived at a @entity46 hospital , the expectant mother started having seizures			0
it was there medical staff asked mr @entity9 to make one of the toughest decisions of his life			0
' the doctors gave me two choices – stay at that hospital and save @entity33 but lose our baby , or risk moving them to @entity11 to save them both , but with a 50/50 chance that neither of them would make it there , ' he told @entity66			0
mr @entity67 took the risk and chose to try and save both his daughter and her mother , which presented only a 50 - 50 chance of survival for both of them when @entity21 was born she weighed less than 600 grams , so small and fragile that her dad 's wedding ring was too big for her arm today , @entity21 is a healthy eight - year - old and mr @entity67 says he is blessed to have both his girls by his side ' [ when they told me ] i actually did something that i thought only happened in movies , not in real life			1
' i fell down and sat on the floor and i thought " i want both of them to live "			0
' i wanted both of them to have a chance , i could n’t imagine not having either of them			0
' finally , mr @entity9 decided to make the trip to @entity11			0
@entity21 was only 597 grams when she was born at 25 weeks and spent her first few weeks in the world fighting for her life , while her mother was in a coma			1
' for three days , i did n’t know whether either of them would make it home , ' mr @entity94 said			2
' [ @entity21 ] was given only a 5 per cent chance of surviving			2
when mrs @entity98 was pregnant with @entity21 she was rushed to hospital with extreme cramps and seizures she was given a five percent change of survival and spent months in neo-natal care mr @entity105 , here with @entity21 at @entity107 a few years ago , says the research done by the @entity109 saved his daughter 's life ' it was a heartbreaking percentage to deal with , but she was just a born fighter			1
' imagine a baby so small that my wedding ring could travel all the way up her arm to her shoulder - that was @entity21			2
' it was during this time that mr @entity9 saw first - hand the benefits of the work of the @entity109 ( @entity109 ) and a short while later he took up a job with the institute as their payroll officer			1
' the research @entity109 conducts finds direct answers to medical and genetic issues which also assist others researchers in other areas , ' he said			2
' several times while i was at the neo-natal intensive care unit , i heard remarks from specialists and doctors about @entity109 and the research they did that led to the oxygenation equipment , and the procedures and techniques used to help @entity21 see again			1
she needed her retinas re-attaching in the early stages of her life , and thanks to the research doctors were able to restore her vision @entity21 's mother was in a coma for the first few days of her daughter 's life , but thankfully both pulled through the nightmare ' part of the ordeal she was going through meant her retinas were detaching , without @entity109 's research , it would have been unavoidable			1
' they helped make some breakthroughs in those areas and led to a better result for @entity21 being able to maintain her vision			0
' mrs @entity33 was able to leave hospital 10 days later , but it was a tougher fight for @entity21			2
after almost three months in neo-natal intensive care , and a further four weeks in the special care unit , the brave little girl was finally able to go home			1
to help families going through similar ordeals , mr @entity9 has asked people to support @entity109 by wearing denim on @entity173 on friday to raise money for their research and donate to their cause by visiting www.jeansforgenes.org.au			2
' while i ’m not connected in a research role , i ’m happy to be a part that makes up this team , ' he said			0
' it ’s wonderful to know that these guys are working on such amazing and wonderful things			0
' @entity173 day is this friday , august 1 and mr @entity67 has urged people to support the worthy cause			1
