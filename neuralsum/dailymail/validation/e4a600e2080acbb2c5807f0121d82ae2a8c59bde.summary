with 40 per cent of @entity1 choosing not to go on holiday abroad in the past year , it makes sense that the latest host of a tv show being jetted off to exotic locations does n't want to be there either			0
@entity8 conducted for @entity11 's new magazine - style show travel man claims 40 per cent of @entity12 have either chosen to take their breaks within the @entity1 or did n't want to go overseas this year			1
the same survey found 30 per cent of respondents , chosen to reflect a cross section of society , have n't left @entity1 for the past five years while one in 10 @entity12 have never been overseas @entity18 host @entity18 and his guest for the show 's first episode , 48 hours in @entity22 a significant 40 per cent of @entity1 did n't go overseas for their holiday in the past year , says a survey the stress of it all is a big reason for this say 31 per cent of the survey subjects , a sentiment @entity18 can relate to on his mission to make the most of his destinations without the hassle			1
in the four - part series @entity18 travels with a celebrity guest to @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity22 , where his journey begins with similarly non-plussed traveller @entity40			1
his other celebrity travel companions for subsequent episodes are comedian @entity44 , actress @entity45 and actor @entity46 much like his other show @entity48 's attitude to life in general , @entity18 aims to get the most he can out of a holiday in the least time			1
in @entity22 , @entity18 is particularly unimpressed by the museum at the home of @entity54 's @entity22 , the @entity55 , owing to his total disinterest in football			2
the @entity11 survey for @entity18 found that 31 per cent of people find the stress of holidays a deterrent despite walking being a perfectly effective way to get around the city , @entity18 opts for a @entity66 pedicab tour to take in sights such as the @entity68 , @entity69 , and the @entity55 as efficiently as they can			1
to get to @entity72 beach , @entity18 goes for a cable car instead of going by car with @entity40			0
in @entity37 with @entity44 , they go to the historic @entity76 just before closing time to avoid the crowds and uses the @entity80 app to ensure all the necessary information he needs is at his fingertips			0
@entity83 and @entity18 visit the @entity55 , home to @entity22 , during the first episode of the new show and to see as much of @entity38 as possible in a short period of time with @entity88 , @entity18 takes a hot - air balloon ride , use a compass - like trekking guide to find their way around the busy @entity94 and a currency converter app to aid with haggling			1
there is no short cut , however , when the pair appear to liven up during a @entity101 tasting - by actually tasting the famed @entity103 sparkling wine			0
the show 's survey found 80 per cent of @entity12 prefer to test out local food and drink when they go abroad , and 60 per cent attempt to pick up some of the language of the place they 're in			0
reluctant traveller @entity18 looks for short - cuts on holiday such as the cable car to @entity72 beach perhaps a surprise to many is that only 32 per cent of @entity12 will chose a break at the beach over a city break while 38 per cent of respondents have been back to a previous holiday destination			2
@entity123 is apparently the dream holiday destination for @entity1 residents , however 23 per cent of us always choose somewhere within @entity126 to take leave time			0
age and geography are other significant factor for travel , with 16 to 34 - year - olds going on holiday the most ( more than twice in the last year )			0
travel man : 48 hours in @entity22 is on monday night at 8.30pm on @entity11			2
