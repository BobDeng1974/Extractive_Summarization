freedoms : the coalition has allowed academies to hire unqualified teachers in line with private schools ( file picture ) the two parties have been locked in an increasingly angry dispute over whether good teachers need to pass exams before being allowed into schools			2
last year mr @entity7 announced academies could employ staff without formal teaching qualifications , in line with freedoms enjoyed by free schools and the independent sector			2
the @entity38 said the flexibility would more schools to hire ‘ great linguists , computer scientists , engineers and other specialists who have not worked in state schools before ’			0
