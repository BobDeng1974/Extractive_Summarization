@entity0 does n't consider herself to be racist			2
the 33 - year - old mother of four from @entity2 thinks it 's unfair that her mother in law raises four children , and an @entity8 woman who lives across the road with the same number of kids gets more in welfare payments			1
' they 're both in housing commissions , the only difference is my mother in law is white and they 've got part @entity8 in them , ' she said			1
' i feel like it 's unfair , my mother in law was in the army when she had my husband and stuff , she 's worked , so it 's very hard it just seems like more things are given to [ @entity29 ]			1
similar to the acclaimed @entity45 , the show takes six ' ordinary ' @entity41 and immerses them in @entity8 communities to try to challenge their prejudices about the @entity29 population			1
' @entity52 sniffing ' , ' wasters ' and ' spending their dole cheques on booze ' are among the labels the six people give to @entity29 at first			1
host @entity34 said none of the opinions he heard on the show shocked him , as he had heard them many times before			2
the veteran journalist and passionate advocate for @entity8 issues said six out of 10 @entity41 have never met or have little to do with an @entity29 person			1
' the @entity8 problem is a festering sore of @entity41 society , it 's one of those things we have to fix , ' mr @entity34 said			1
@entity0 says that months after filming she feels like some of her questions went unanswered , and she still believes it is unfair @entity29 get higher welfare payments and placements in university the 33 - year - old mother of four from @entity2 became distressed when watching a turtle be killed for food ' so we thought we would take six people - average @entity41 who were n't racists , or weirdos or nutters – and have people willing to ask questions and willing to question their beliefs			1
' why do they drink so much , why do n't they send their kids to school , why do n't they leave townships and get a job ? they are all valid questions and not racist questions			2
' but while most participants have their strong opinions about @entity8 changed over the course of the program , @entity0 says she is still ' up in the air '			1
she told @entity101 that months after filming , and before the first of three episodes begins airing on tuesday night , she feels like some of her questions went unanswered			2
' definitely the whole welfare thing , you know the money , i feel like that was n't properly answered , ' she said			2
over 28 days , the participants stayed with @entity8 people all over the country @entity40 ( centre , in dark green ) feels like her views have been completely changed by the experience ' and how they can automatically get a place in uni degrees			1
' obviously because i 've got children too i feel like it affects me , they might be taking my children 's place in uni			2
' over 28 days , the participants stayed with @entity8 people all over the country and were immersed in their way of life , from people living in @entity132 in inner - city @entity133 to remote communities only accessible by plane			1
@entity0 said this helped her reconsider some things - but not everything			0
' i still do n't fully understand the stolen generation , but i understand that @entity140 needed to say sorry			0
i was on the fence , ' she said			0
' i definitely believe some remote communities are disadvantaged to some degree			2
host and veteran journalist @entity34 hopes viewers will recognise themselves in the six participants , and similarly will question the way they think ' the @entity8 problem is a festering sore of @entity41 society , ' mr @entity34 said @entity37 ( left ) said @entity29 were disadvantaged while @entity32 ( right ) said she thought they spent their dole cheques on alcohol ' but definitely not the @entity8 people that live close to major cities , they 're not disadvantaged in any way			1
' @entity0 says she thinks she 's ignorant but not racist – but she acknowledges that viewers will probably disagree			0
' i 'm not worried and i stand behind everything i said , ' she said			0
' the biggest myth is that @entity8 people get a special deal , when comes to welfare and life			1
' they do not get a special deal , we said to the guys " you 've seen the truth , hands up those who ’d swap places with an @entity8 " and not one said yes			1
' the special deals they get are health , education and housing that is woeful and shameful			0
' the other one is that they get interest free cars and interest free housing , it 's amazing how many people think that , and that 's bs that just is n't true			0
' i guess the other one is they 're loafers and do n’t want to help themselves			0
' when people say why do @entity8 kids get a special deal for education ? that ’s just good economics – it 's dopey to keep paying this money for people who are on welfare or in jail because they do n't have an education			1
' ' it 's just because of ignorance - i did n't get taught anything about @entity8 people at school			1
' she says her husband also shares her views , even though he possibly has @entity8 heritage			1
' he 's very anti because of the name they 've got , you know " they 're slackers they 're dole bludgers " , they get interest free home loans and stuff , ' she said			0
' just at the fact that they get handed everything - that 's why he 's worked all his life since 16 and he 's worked for the house we 've got			0
' @entity0 hopes to talk to the cast members and some of the @entity8 people that featured on the show at a reunion party on thursday to clear up some of her unanswered questions			1
another cast member , @entity230 , feels like her views have been completely changed by the experience			0
the 25 - year - old , who works at a supermarket and lives in @entity234 in @entity235 , cringes when she thinks about some of the things she said in front of the camera			0
' i said @entity8 people were wasters , i said they do n't have jobs and that they get a lot of free stuff , ' she said			1
' going into it i really needed to get my wisdom teeth out but i could n't afford it , and if i was of @entity8 descent i could have got it done			1
' i guess it 's hard … people wonder why there 's a different way for @entity8 people to get stuff			2
' @entity40 said her most difficult moment came in the remote community of @entity259 off the coast of @entity261 in the @entity262			0
' the conditions were very confronting , it 's almost third world being part of @entity140 and i never thought places like that existed here			0
@entity35 said she thought she identified with @entity8 beliefs the tv show airs over three night on @entity43 and starts on tuesday november 18 ' the first night was the most scariest night i 've ever had in my life			1
' @entity40 said she was being rude to their hosts because she felt threatened by the rubbish and wild dogs			0
' i hope when people watch it they can appreciate that the place was really different to what i 'm used to , ' she said			0
' i said things like " why is it so dirty , if you can afford to smoke you can afford to get cleaning products "			0
' the highlight was visiting @entity287 in @entity140 , where @entity8 leader june @entity288 has successfully campaigned for laws restricting the purchase of alcohol in the town			2
among its population , one - third of children suffer from foetal alcohol syndrome			2
@entity298 , 25 , who works at a supermarket and lives in @entity234 in @entity235 , cringes when she thinks about some of the things she said in front of the camera law enforcement officer @entity33 ( left ) as one point said ' aboriginal people keep using the past ... move on ' ' they started in their community a ban on alcohol , so it was really good , it was the first community that showed self - determination which was really impressive to see in my eyes , ' bo - dene said			0
' a lot of places were in the mindset that they were waiting for outside help , it 's a very tough cycle			0
' @entity40 knows she is opening herself up to a lot of criticism by appearing on the show , but she chose to do it because she wanted her mind to be changed			0
' growing up i did n't have a lot of interaction with @entity8 people , and i only ever see @entity8 people come to the service desk at work to get money , ' she said			2
' i do n't consider myself a racist - a lot of my closest friends are from @entity338 and @entity339 and stuff – and it annoyed me i had such a negative opinion of @entity8 people			2
' i really wanted my opinion to change , which is why i asked so many questions			0
' mr @entity34 hopes viewers will recognise themselves in the six participants , and similarly will question the way they think			0
' people who watch it hopefully will say that 's what i think , that 's my opinion too , which is not racist they simply do n't know , ' he said			0
