by @entity0 published : 03:23 est , 29 june 2012 updated : 09:45 est , 29 june 2012 another scandal rocked the financial sector today as the @entity4 watchdog revealed some of @entity7 's largest banks will have to refund or pay compensation to potentially thousands of small businesses			1
@entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 ( @entity13 ) have all agreed to compensate customers after the @entity15 found ' serious failings ' in the sale of complex financial products			1
they were found to have mis - sold so - called interest rate swap arrangements ( @entity20 ) , which some small businesses bought as protection - or to act as a hedge - against a rise in interest rates without fully grasping the downside risks			1
scandal : @entity13 and three other banks have all agreed to compensate customers after the @entity15 found ' serious failings ' in the sale of complex financial products banks sold about 28,000 interest rate protection products to customers since 2001 , the @entity15 said			1
@entity31 , managing director of the @entity15 ’s conduct business unit , said : ' for many small businesses this has been a difficult and distressing experience with many people ’s livelihoods affected			0
' the claims echo the payment protection insurance ( @entity41 ) scandal that emerged last year , costing banks billions of pounds , and come in the week @entity10 was fined £ 290million for manipulating the rates at which banks lend to each other			1
as well as offering redress directly for those customers that bought the most complex products , the banks have also agreed to stop marketing certain @entity20 products to retail customers , the @entity15 said			1
the @entity4 regulator has spent the last two months reviewing the sale of @entity20 , talking to more than 100 customers who came forward			2
mis - selling : @entity10 and @entity11 are among the banks facing hefty compensation bills it found poor sales tactics including failing to provide sufficient information on the hefty exit costs involved , failure to gauge the customers ’ understanding of risk and found rewards and incentives were a driver of these practices			1
the @entity15 added that not all businesses will be owed redress , but for those that are , the exact redress will vary from customer to customer			0
this exercise will be scrutinised by an independent reviewer at each bank appointed under the @entity15 ’s powers			0
mr @entity31 added that he had received personal reassurances from the bosses of the banks involved - including @entity83 at @entity10 - that they will have responsibility for oversight of this work			0
mr @entity83 is facing calls to resign over the interest - rate rigging scandal , and @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity11 are all under investigation			1
the @entity90 , the leading trade association for the @entity7 banking and financial services sector with more than 200 member banks , said : ' our members have been working closely with the @entity15 while it carries out its thematic review into interest rate swaps and will continue to co-operate fully			2
' in a statement , @entity12 , which set aside £ 3.6billion to cover the cost of @entity41 compensation , said it did not expect the costs of redressing customers who were missold @entity20 products to be ' material '			1
it said : ' interest rate derivative products are not products the group has sold widely			1
' given the limited exposure of the group to these products the financial impact of this remediation and the associated costs are not expected to be material to the group			0
' thousands of small businesses who took out loans bought interest rate swap arrangements ( @entity20 ) in the hope of keeping their borrowing costs low			1
but many have been left paying the price , claiming they were not told about the potential pitfalls which lay ahead			0
banks promoted @entity20 as providing protection to borrowers with variable rate loans			2
if interest rates went up , customers with an @entity20 would pay no more than an agreed capped rate			1
the deal was attractive when interest rates were as high as 5.5 per cent before the credit crunch of 2008			0
but rates have since fallen to 0.5 per cent , which means customers ' monthly loan repayments under an @entity20 are higher than they would have been without one			2
@entity137 , a pressure group set up by alleged victims of swap mis - selling , claims on its website : ' in many cases the bank had simply never explained the possibility of this happening , and so customers were denied the opportunity of making an informed choice when entering into an @entity20			2
' the group claims banks failed to explain the negative aspects of the @entity20 because the products were sold by specialist teams who earned high levels of commission			2
some customers have paid high costs to extricate themselves from their @entity20 deals			0
a statement for @entity13 said : ' in the case of a small number of less sophisticated customers who entered into more complex swap products we have agreed to move directly to redress			2
' we believe risk management products are an essential part of corporate banking and it is important we restore customer trust in this area			0
' we are committed to the fair and timely treatment of our customers and will work closely with the @entity15 to achieve that end			0
' a debate in the @entity178 last week saw mps from across the country offer examples of mis - selling for the interest rate swap products			1
promise : @entity10 chief executive @entity83 , who is facing calls to resign over the interest - rate rigging scandal , has assured the @entity15 he will personally oversee the payment of compensation to customers @entity190 mp @entity189 claimed thousands of businesses lost large amounts of money after being mis - sold the complex products by their banks , and many were told that without signing up they risked being refused credit			1
he said many business people did not understand the deals but trusted their bank manager			0
in other cases , he said , businesses were offered only one product and the bank made no effort to provide a choice			0
a survey by @entity208 , which has been set up by alleged victims of swap mis - selling , found nearly three quarters of its members claim to have been forced to buy a swap by their lending bank as a condition of their loan			0
@entity219 , of @entity4 law firm @entity220 , which has acted for @entity20 customers , said the @entity15 's announcement was ' welcome news to the thousands of small businesses who were wrongly advised , and sometimes obliged , to needlessly take out these complex financial contracts '			1
he added : ' over the life of their contract , these financial products turned out to be for the sole benefit of the banks and in the vast majority of cases were highly inappropriate for small and medium - sized enterprises			0
' sold as protection against rising interest rates , they had the effect of keeping struggling businesses on artificially high rates , costing them thousands of pounds per month to service			2
' furthermore , businesses were all too often unable to service these agreements due to the high breakage fees , the risk profile of which the banks never properly explained to them			0
' we are aware of many businesess that have been forced into severe financial distress , administration and liquidation , often at a huge emotional cost to the owners and managers , as they were unable to keep up with their payments			0

@entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 all agree to compensate customers who bought @entity20
