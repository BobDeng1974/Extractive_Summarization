by @entity1 reporter published : 13:43 est , 9 may 2013 updated : 14:43 est , 9 may 2013 shamed : army sergeant @entity2 is catholic but says she was taunted by felow servicemen because her named sounded @entity4 army sergeant 1st class @entity2 is @entity6 , but that did n’t stop some of her fellow @entity9 soldiers in @entity10 from taunting her about what they believed was her @entity4 - sounding last name			1
in fact , @entity2 got so fed up with her nickname of ‘ @entity16 ’ and being quizzed about which god she prayed to , that the @entity19 native changed her name			1
before she deployed for a second war tour , @entity2 legally became @entity22			1
this did not solve her problems			2
@entity22 complained to her superiors about constant @entity28 slurs and jokes			1
she says they responded with a series of reprisals intended to drive her out of the @entity34 , leading her to consider suicide			1
‘ my complaints fell on deaf ears every time , ’ said @entity22 , 41 , a member of the @entity34 's @entity38 based at @entity39 , @entity40 ‘ any time i would say something about it i was treated like i did n't know what i was talking about or that i 'm an idiot or that i was a @entity46 sympathizer			1
it was just a very lonely feeling			2
’ determined to remain in the service for at least eight years , until she is eligible for retirement , @entity22 recently re-enlisted			2
but she agreed to tell her story to @entity1 because ‘ i do n't want this to happen to anyone else if i can help it			1
it 's a horrible to feel like people are against you when you are supposed to be on the same team			2
’ @entity39 spokeswoman @entity58 said the @entity34 would not comment on the case , and referred questions to the @entity9 @entity61			2
the @entity62 for the @entity63 of @entity40 , assigned to defend the @entity34 , also declined comment			2
but her account is supported by an affidavit filed by an old friend , sharon @entity67 , who said that @entity22 had confided in her about the harassment she had suffered , telling @entity69 that she was so unhappy that she no longer wanted to live			2
a @entity72 linguist who works in military intelligence , @entity22 's multicultural background exemplifies the kind of soldier @entity34 recruiters prize — @entity9 citizens with ethnic ties to a part of the world many @entity9 ca n't find on a map			1
@entity22 's father , @entity82 , was born into a @entity46 family on the @entity85 island of @entity86 , where his parents had emigrated from @entity88			2
he converted to @entity89 after meeting @entity22 's mother , a @entity6 from the @entity91 , and became a @entity9 citizen shortly after his daughter was born in @entity19			1
he changed the spelling of his family name to taunted : sergeant 1st @entity96 transferred from a post in @entity99 to one in @entity40 , but says nicknames like ' sgt. @entity16 ' followed her @entity2 in the hope his children would avoid discrimination			1
‘ he americanized it , ’ his daughter explained			2
‘ he got @entity2 from @entity107			1
he kept hearing it in church			2
’ she reported for basic training two months after the terrorist attacks on sept. 11 , 2001			2
‘ before 9 - 11 , my last name never raised an eyebrow , ’ she said			2
‘ but after 9 - 11 , i felt compelled to tell people i am a @entity115 and felt i had to prove i was loyal to the @entity9			2
’ her first deployment was to @entity10 in 2005			1
she said other soldiers , including her supervisors , mocked her family name and made crude jokes			2
‘ i was called sgt. @entity16 , as in @entity123 , ’ she said			1
‘ even when i would correct them on the pronunciation of my name , i was still called sgt. @entity16			1
i was asked what @entity127 i pray to			2
and there were a lot of references to hajjis , used as a derogatory term			0
’ @entity135 , in fact , are @entity46 who have made the pilgrimage to the @entity138 birthplace of the prophet @entity139			0
but @entity22 said she regularly heard @entity9 troops use the word as racist slang for enemy , terrorist or suicide bomber			1
‘ my uncle is a hajji , because he made the pilgrimage to @entity149 in 2005 , ’ @entity22 said			0
‘ i would stand up for what i thought was right and say , ' not all terrorists are @entity46 and not all @entity46 are terrorists			0
' that just opened the door for more harassment			0
’ extremes : @entity2 went so far as to change her name @entity158 , a former @entity9 @entity159 officer who founded @entity160 , said @entity22 's experience is not uncommon			1
military personnel who are @entity46 or perceived to be of @entity164 descent are often targets for discrimination , he said			0
‘ when a @entity46 soldier , sailor or airman stands up for themselves , they are the subject of vicious reprisal and retribution , ’ said @entity158 , who is @entity167			0
‘ what ( sgt. nova ) has gone through is horrible , but it is typical			1
’ in 2007 , while serving in @entity178 , @entity99 , @entity22 said co-worker told her and others a racist joke about @entity46			1
when she objected , @entity22 said , a supervisor warned her to stop making trouble			1
instead , she filed a formal complaint with the @entity34 's @entity185 , the program charged with ensuring the military provides an environment ‘ free of unlawful discrimination and offensive behavior			0
’ within days , @entity22 said she was removed from her job and ordered to take a ‘ command directed ’ mental health evaluation			0
‘ in writing , the referral said my values were not in line with mission , ’ she said			0
‘ they considered me a ' @entity46 sympathizer , ' that i was too loyal to @entity46			1
’ rather than address her complaint , @entity22 said , the @entity34 transferred her to the @entity38 at @entity39			0
though she hoped to make a fresh start with her new unit , word of her complaint followed her to @entity40			0
that treatment worsened after a november 2009 shooting rampage at @entity207 in @entity208			0
maj. @entity209 , a muslim , is charged with killing 13 people			0
his name sounded a lot like hers			0
@entity22 changed her name shortly before deploying to @entity216 last year			1
she arrived just after worn copies of the @entity218 were found to have been burned with trash from a @entity9 - run prison outside the capital of @entity222 , a widely reported incident that triggered violent protests			0
new : just prior to shipping out to a second tour , this time to @entity216 , @entity2 officially became @entity22 the @entity34 responded by initiating a new training program on the proper handling and disposal of @entity4 materials			1
but @entity22 said she discovered that her unit trashed and burned documents collected through intelligence gathering that contained what could be considered sacred writings			1
@entity22 conferred with an on - base military chaplain , and suggested designating a special box for @entity4 materials so they could be disposed of in a more appropriate manner			0
‘ when i brought this up , i was told ' sgt. @entity22 , you ca n't bring your religion to work ... , ' ‘ she recalled			1
‘ i changed my name , but that did n't change other people 's ignorance			1
’ after just two months in @entity216 , she said her commanders removed her from her job and ordered her back to @entity39			1
with the help of a @entity252 lawyer , @entity251 , she filed a formal complaint with the @entity34 's inspector general in october seeking a voluntary discharge due to being subjected to ‘ adverse treatment and negative , prejudicial remarks ... concerning the @entity46 faith			0
’ @entity22 said she grew so depressed that she considered suicide			1
she checked herself into an on - base hospital for treatment , staying for about a week before returning to duty			0
after learning of her @entity265 complaint and hospitalization , @entity22 's commanders at @entity39 responded by filing paperwork to involuntarily end her military career and bar her from reenlistment for ‘ ineffective leadership			0
’ no change : @entity2 says even her new name did n't stop the bullying and after she complained she was nearly given a forced discharge typical : @entity158 , pictured , founder of the @entity160 , called @entity2 's experience common @entity22 's @entity34 performance review from a few months earlier , a copy of which she provided to @entity1 , shows her as meeting expectations in all categories , with her senior commander rating her potential for promotion and increased responsibility as ‘ superior			1
’ the forced discharge could have imperiled @entity22 's ability to get a civilian job , denied her @entity287 medical care and educational benefits			0
after exhausting her administrative options for fighting her case , @entity251 helped @entity22 file a complaint in federal court alleging discriminatory treatment and asking a judge to prevent her discharge			0
rather than fight the case in court , the @entity34 retreated			0
shortly before a key hearing before the judge , @entity251 says he got a call from @entity34 lawyers informing him that the disciplinary action against @entity22 was ‘ completely off the table			0
’ she , in turn , agreed to drop the lawsuit			0
@entity22 re-enlisted in the @entity34 on april 8			0
she recently married , and is preparing to ship out next month to attend a senior leadership course and then report to a new assignment in @entity308			0
‘ i want to put all this behind me			0
i want to move on to my next duty assignment ... , ’ said @entity22			0
‘ my beliefs are n't any different from what the @entity34 states as its beliefs and values			1
i would like to be treated fairly			0
’ relief : her record otherwise spotless , @entity2 has since sought representation and disciplinary action has been ' taken off the table '			1

sergeant 1st class @entity2 says she was nicknamed ' sgt. *hussein* ' and quizzed about what god she prayed to while serving in @entity10 and @entity216
the @entity19 native went as far as to change her name to stop the taunts from equals as well as superiors but even that did n't work and @entity2 considered suicide
