@entity12 , from @entity13 , uploaded a short video of him asking his partner @entity15 to marry him while she conducted an online discussion with @entity11 users about customer service			1
when she was bombarded with the question she initially tweeted : ' um , wow ! ! @entity34 @ curtbuthman : @ marshacollier i love you ! # @entity38 < 3 # custserv ' but then the @entity13 businesswoman quickly accepted his proposal , writing : ' um , uh , @entity41 @ curtbuthman - i will marry you ! # custserv ' - much to the delight of her audience			1
the loved - up pair made sure to use the hashtag # custserv , which brought it to the attention of anyone who wanted to take part in the regular online conversation about customer service			0

a shocked @entity15 immediately accepted the unusual proposal - much to the delight of her thousands of followers the daughter of @entity15 seemed unsurprised - but delighted - that her mother would get engaged using technology ms @entity15 , author of the @entity63 on @entity64 and @entity65 , was flooded with congratulations from her 70,000 followers , while many applauded her fiance for his bold move			1

the couple , who have been together for two years , celebrated with pizza and promised that there impending wedding would include her @entity11 followers too			1
