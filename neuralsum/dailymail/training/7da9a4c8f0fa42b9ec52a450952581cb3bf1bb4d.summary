by @entity1 reporter @entity2 is crying foul on insiders who recently told the media that encrypted @entity6 were stolen along with more than 40 million credit and debit card numbers in the retail behemoth 's catastrophic data breach			1
the hackers who attacked @entity2 and compromised more than 40 million credit cards and debit cards also managed to steal encrypted personal identification numbers , according to a senior payments executive familiar with the situation told @entity18			1
however , @entity2 spokeswoman @entity19 insisted that ' no unencrypted pin data was accessed ' and there was no evidence that pin data has been ' compromised '			2
she confirmed that some ' encrypted data ' was stolen , but declined to say if that included encrypted @entity6			2
denied : @entity2 says there is no evidence @entity6 were compromised as part of the retail behemoth embarrassing and worrisome @entity31 security breach one major @entity33 bank fears that the thieves would be able to crack the encryption code and make fraudulent withdrawals from consumer bank accounts , said the executive , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the data breach is still under investigation			1
the hackers who attacked @entity2 and compromised more than 40 million credit cards and debit cards also managed to steal encrypted personal identification numbers , according to a senior payments executive familiar with the situation			1
' we continue to have no reason to believe that pin data , whether encrypted or unencrypted , was compromised			0
and we have not been made aware of any such issue in communications with financial institutions to date , ' @entity19 said by email			0
' we are very early in an ongoing forensic and criminal investigation			0
' ' to date , there is no evidence that unencrypted pin data has been compromised , ' @entity2 said in a statement the @entity62 revelations come at a time of heightened concern about data breaches following revelations of a massive theft of payment card records from @entity2 the no. 3 @entity33 retailer said last week that hackers stole data from as many as 40 million cards used at @entity2 stores during the first three weeks of the holiday shopping season , making it the second - largest data breach in @entity33 retail history			1
@entity2 has not said how its systems were compromised , though it described the operation as ' sophisticated '			1
the @entity78 and the @entity79 are investigating			0
officials with both agencies have declined comment on the investigations			0
the news comes as the retailer says it has learned of some incidents of scam emails related to its recent data breach			1
the company says it is aware of ' limited instances ' of scam emails , but does not have specific information			1
the @entity95 retailer says it is creating a section of its website for @entity2 's official communications so customers can verify the authenticity of notes from the retailer			2
the attack could end up costing hundreds of millions of dollars , but it is unclear so far who will bear the expense			0
@entity107 reports the company faces at least 15 lawsuits seeking class action status as a result of the cyber-attack			1
the suits were filed by people who claim their information was stolen , and they allege @entity2 either failed to properly secure the customer data , did not promptly notify customers of the breach or both			1
but so little information disclosed so far about the breach , it is unclear whether the plaintiffs will be able to prove their allegations			2
hacked : the hackers who attacked @entity2 and compromised more than 40 million credit cards and debit cards also allegedly managed to steal encrypted personal identification numbers denial : @entity2 says ' no unencrypted pin data was accessed ' and that there was no evidence that pin data has been ' compromised ' meanwhile , @entity135 , @entity136 of @entity137 and @entity138 of @entity139 , have asked the @entity140 to investigate the breach			1
' if @entity2 failed to adequately protect customer information , it denied customers the protection that they rightly expect when a business collects their personal information , ' @entity136 said in a letter to @entity140 chairwoman @entity149 today			2
' its conduct would be unfair and deceptive			0
' while bank customers are typically not liable for losses because of fraudulent activity on their credit and debit cards , @entity151 and @entity152 said they have lowered limits on how much cash customers can take out of teller machines and spend at stores			2
the unprecedented move has led to complaints from consumer advocates about the inconvenience it caused from the late november @entity168 holiday into the run - up to @entity170			0
but sorting out account activity after a fraudulent withdrawal could take a lot more time and be worse for customers			0
@entity151 has said it was able to reduce inconvenience by giving customers new debit cards printed quickly at many of its branches , and by keeping branches open for extended hours			0
a @entity152 spokeswoman was not available for comment today			0
security experts said it is highly unusual for banks to reduce caps on withdrawals , and the move likely reflects worries that @entity6 have fallen into criminal hands , even if they are encrypted			0
' that 's a really extreme measure to take , ' said @entity194 , a @entity195 analyst who specializes in cyber security and fraud detection			0
' they definitely found something in the data that showed there was something happening with cash withdrawals			0
' litigation : @entity2 reportedly faces at least 15 lawsuits seeking class action status while the use of encryption codes may prevent amateur hackers from obtaining the digital keys to customer bank deposits , the concern is the coding can not stop the kind of sophisticated cyber criminal who was able to infiltrate @entity2 for three weeks			1
@entity217 , ceo of @entity218 , a cyber security consulting firm , said banks were prudent to lower debit card limits because they will not know for sure if @entity2 's pin encryption was infallible until the investigation is completed			1
as an example of potential vulnerabilities in pin encryption , @entity217 said he once worked for a retailer who hired his firm to hack into its network to find security vulnerabilities			0
he was able to access the closely guarded digital ' key ' used to unscramble encrypted @entity6 , which he said surprised his client , who thought the data was secure			0
in other cases , hackers can get pins by using a tool known as a ' @entity240 ' , which captures the @entity6 while they are temporarily stored in memory , @entity217 said			2
the attack on @entity2 began on november 27 , the day before the @entity168 holiday and continued until december 15			1
banks that issue debit and credit cards learned about the breach on december 18 , and @entity2 publicly disclosed the loss of personal account data on december 19			1
on december 21 , @entity151 , the largest @entity33 bank , alerted two million of its debit cardholders that it was lowering the daily limits on atm withdrawals to $ 100 and capping store purchases with their cards at $ 500			2
on monday , the bank partly eased the limits it had imposed on saturday , setting them at $ 250 a day for @entity258 withdrawals and $ 1,000 a day for purchases			0
( the usual debit card daily limits are $ 200 to $ 500 for cash withdrawals and $ 500 for purchases , a bank spokeswoman said last week			2
) on monday , @entity152 - a unit of @entity266 's @entity152 - followed suit , lowering the daily limits on cash withdrawals and purchases on @entity152 and @entity270 branded debit and credit cards of customers who used them at @entity2 when the breach occurred			1
@entity152 did not disclose the new limits , but said it was monitoring the accounts and issuing new cards to customers who were affected			0
the largest breach against a @entity33 retailer , uncovered in 2007 at @entity280 , led to the theft of data from more than 90 million credit cards over about 18 months .			1
