by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 01:36 est , 8 may 2013 updated : 04:46 est , 8 may 2013 @entity4 's first pay - as - you - go motorway is proving to be a flop with traffic dropping by 40 percent in just seven years			1
the head of the region 's local transport authority says the @entity11 toll road which runs through the @entity12 , has not relieved congestion on the motorway around @entity15			1
@entity17 , chief executive of @entity18 , the @entity12 transport authority , called on the government to take the @entity11 toll road out of private hands to ease congestion around @entity4 ’s second largest city , after evidence emerged that traffic on the toll road has fallen since its peak of 55,000 vehicles a day in 2006			1
under used : the @entity27 should be nationalised rather than expanding the original @entity11 to cope with the projected 25 per cent increase in traffic over the next 15 years , transport chief @entity17 said when the £ 900m road was completed ten years ago it was hoped the 27 mile stretch would relieve traffic congestion around @entity15 with around 74,000 vehicles predicted to use the road each day			1
currently , around little more than half – 34,360 - the number of vehicles expected to use the road each day actually do , with congestion costing the @entity12 economy £ 2 billion a year			1
it was thought to be an ideal alternative to traffic jams for drivers , but when traffic is clear on the original @entity11 , the cost deters motorists and the toll route is marginally longer than the free motorway			1
congestion around @entity15 has now become so bad that the @entity50 has already begun work on converting the hard shoulder of the original @entity11 into a new lane in order to deal with the additional traffic			2
mr @entity17 told @entity56 : ' if the @entity58 can not be made to work in terms of attracting more vehicles off the @entity11 then one solution is to take it into public ownership			2
this would give us the option of setting a level of charge that does encourage through traffic			0
' falling numbers : traffic on the toll road has dropped by 45 per cent since 2006 , it has been reported @entity72 – a subsidiary of @entity74 – which owns and operates the @entity11 toll road has blamed the economic downturn for the fall in traffic on the road			1
but critics have also pointed to excessive charges to use the road			0
it costs £ 5.50 for a car to use the 27 - mile stretch of motorway but for @entity88 its costs double this amount			0
mr @entity17 said that nine out of 10 lorries now use the original motorway			1
' we believe this is due to the price hauliers and motorists are being asked to pay			0
it ’s important we keep the region moving and one way of doing that is to get @entity100 , which are not stopping in @entity15 , off the @entity11 and onto the toll road , ' he said			1
there have been eight price rises in the ten years since the toll road opened in december 2003 when a car could travel on the road for just £ 2			2
@entity100 were charged £ 10 for use of the road before the charge fell to £ 6 the next year only for prices to begin rising again in 2005			0
professor @entity111 , director of the @entity112 , said : ' the problem is not private sector involvement but that ministers never insisted on regulated tolls			0
in a way , who can blame the operator ? if they can maximise their income by having fewer cars paying more then why would n’t they ? there ’s less wear and tear on the road , and you need fewer staff and toll booths			0
unfortunately what is good news for the company running the road is bad news for most drivers			0
' the call to nationalise the road comes amid a debate on how to finance new road building in @entity4 , with tolls being one option given consideration by the @entity143 , although the government has ruled this option out for existing roads			2
plans to privatise the motorway network have also been shelved			0
the @entity150 's owner , @entity74 faces the additional problem of a £ 1billion debt burden associated with the road following a refinancing in 2006			2
the bank is currently in talks with its creditors to restructure the debt			0
in july , @entity72 is making the toll road free to use for all haulage vehicles in an effort to attract more hauliers to use it			1
the toll is due to remain in private hands until 2054 and the @entity166 said the government had no plans to nationalise the road before this .			0

@entity11 is @entity4 's only privately - run toll road - runs through @entity12
traffic on toll road has fallen 40 *%* since peak of 55,000 vehicles a day in 2006
nine out of 10 lorries now use the original motorway
