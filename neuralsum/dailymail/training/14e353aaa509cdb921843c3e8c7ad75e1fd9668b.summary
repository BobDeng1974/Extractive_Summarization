pressure : @entity1 has been faced with a string of personal problems in recent months an impossibly dewy and gorgeous version of @entity1 still peeks out from the cover of april ’s @entity6 on news - stands			1
but in pictures taken on a @entity10 street this week , she looks like a different woman altogether : grey - skinned and worn down , her neck lined and her hair sadly sparse			2
for once , you can easily believe she is 54 years old			2
her supporters loyally insist she is ‘ subdued ’ but far from beaten			2
for her part , the best fighting talk she could manage — and this was before that embarrassing business at @entity20 , where she was denied permission to fly to the @entity23 — was : ‘ well , i ’m alive			1
you know , i have had better times			2
’ with the future of her latest tv show the taste uncertain , a lavish lifestyle to run and continuing toxic fall - out from the court battle with her one - time aides , the @entity35 sisters , these are stressful times for the @entity1			1
the embarrassment of being denied entry to @entity23 , on account of her self - confessed use of cocaine and cannabis , was considerable			1
it certainly damaged her image — reviving the drugs scandal that erupted during the trial of her former assistants just as she was hoping to put it behind her			2
@entity54 , head of programming for @entity56 in @entity23 , said : ‘ this has to be devastating for her			1
an incident like this raises all sorts of questions of how she can continue to work and move beyond the troubles of her past			2
’ the timing is terrible , too			2
over the next three weeks , @entity68 is expected to decide whether to commission a third series of @entity70			1
even before the current brouhaha , it seemed unlikely			2
the show has been mauled by critics , and its relative lack of success is a matter of great sadness for @entity1 , who was chasing her big break in @entity23			1
i ’m told that @entity81 , a fellow judge on the taste and a big name on @entity84 , has been championing @entity1 among his contacts and that she still hopes to have a career on the other side of the pond			1
and while she may be relatively unknown in @entity23 , she is extremely well - paid there , reputedly earning a £ 120,000 an episode for the taste — far more than she could hope to earn here			1
torment : the celebrity chef wept as she discussed her troubles on a chat show last month sources close to @entity1 insist she has become awkwardly aware of money since splitting from @entity97			1
her former husband is worth £ 130 million , and in their ten years together , @entity1 became accustomed to his head - spinning largesse : £ 7,000 on a sofa , £ 11,000 on @entity102 tickets , £ 25,000 on flowers and so on			1
yet @entity1 walked out of the marital home with nothing apart from the contents of the kitchen , including her immense collection of cookbooks			1
it seems she values her dignity too much			2
( not for nothing does an old school friend call her ‘ lovely , but terribly grand ’			2
) however , she does have a respectable fortune of somewhere between £ 15 million and £ 20 million — her career earnings so far			0
she is living in a £ 11,000 - a - month mews house following stays in various hotels , but is said to have earmarked £ 3 million for a new @entity10 home			0
by any normal standards , @entity1 ought surely to consider herself extremely wealthy			1
yet apparently she is worried that she might be ‘ broke ’ by this time next year			0
why ? it seems that she will complain in anxious tones that she is ‘ no good ’ with money			1
free : @entity1 is said to feel liberated following her divorce from @entity97 neither she nor @entity97 seem to have paid much attention to the gigantic bills run up by the @entity127 , hence the extraordinary court case that saw the sisters cleared of wrongdoing			1
post divorce , apparently she allows household bills to mount up in a disorganised muddle , but has her redoubtable @entity135 take care of them eventually			0
she has also run up huge legal fees after engaging expensive libel and divorce lawyers			0
one source claims the @entity143 legal bill was in the ‘ high six figures ’			0
no wonder she has been heard wishing she could return to the simple life in @entity148 ’s @entity147 , @entity10 , she enjoyed with her first husband , the late @entity149			0
one friend described her lifestyle as a ‘ mink - lined coffin ’ because she will have to hang on to a high level of success to sustain it			1
put simply , she can not afford not to work			0
for example , she recently spent a weekend in @entity158 ’s hotel in @entity10 with a female friend , hanging out in pyjamas and ordering room service ‘ for a laugh ’			0
the bill seems to have run into thousands			0
it ’s a lot of money to pay on a whim , even if you are a multi-millionaire			2
and she is understood to have kept ‘ @entity169 ’ — four women who help her with her website , @entity174 feed , cookery app and the daily organisation of her life			2
she has to pay all their salaries without @entity181 ’s help			0
star : the taste , starring @entity184 and @entity81 alongside @entity1 , is struggling in the @entity23 television ratings but — money aside — what is the rest of her new life like ? by all accounts , @entity1 , while sometimes lonely , likes the freedom of not being married			1
@entity97 was greedily possessive , demanding she join him in bed to watch tv all afternoon and evening , and insisting on sitting next to her at dinner parties so they could whisper together			1
she loves reading , but had to keep up with the latest novels in the back of cabs so he was n’t made jealous by her engagement in something other than him			0
now , the @entity203 graduate is enjoying books again			0
she boasted to @entity6 , for instance , that she was reading @entity206 — in @entity207			0
she has also been devouring @entity208 and @entity209			0
in a brave attempt to build a new life for herself , she has also reconnected with her old social circle			0
there have been dinners with the actor @entity216 and the novelist @entity217 , an old confidant			0
@entity1 is also starting to go out to events again			1
@entity97 hated parties , but she does not			1
she was at producer @entity221 ’s @entity220 in february and the recent premiere of the @entity224 production of @entity225			0
she was also a surprise guest at a private party to celebrate the publication of author @entity230 ’s new book			0
the @entity10 literary crowd very much pre-dates @entity97 ’s influence — and they are delighted to have ‘ the old , confident ’ @entity1 back			1
her ‘ coven ’ of close friends includes fun - loving actress @entity234 , documentary producer @entity235 and heiress @entity236			2
make - up artist @entity239 is another trusted presence , as is film producer @entity241 , a school friend			0
to these have been added male protectors who adore her			0
they include her smoothie agent @entity244 , greengrocer @entity245 , her lawyer @entity246 and fishmonger @entity247			0
defiant : @entity1 pictured arriving at court to give evidence in the trial of the @entity35 sisters last year there is , though , no new man — yet			1
@entity1 seems to have no appetite for dating , though her friends expect it wo n’t be long before she finds a romantic partner			1
instead there is a scruffy version of domestic bliss			0
@entity6 writer @entity262 found her in a messy home in @entity264 , with books all over the floor , propped up on silk pillows and drinking builders ’ tea			0
she declined to talk about her failed marriage , saying : ‘ i never wanted to speak about my divorce			0
i had to in court and i hated doing that and i wo n’t do that again			0
’ professionally , she is producing a new book and cookery app for smart phones			2
but far more significantly she has been re-establishing some harmony at home for her children @entity282 , 20 , and @entity283 , 17			0
@entity181 found it hard to cope with the youngsters and they ended up leading separate lives — but now they are at least once more a firm family unit			0
there is regret on @entity1 ’s side over her relationship with @entity97 ’s daughter @entity291 , from his marriage to @entity293			1
@entity291 , 19 , lived with them and regarded @entity1 warmly as a stepmother			1
but according to sources on the @entity181 side of the fence , it was @entity291 who became alarmed about @entity1 smoking cannabis and informed her father			1
@entity181 later brought @entity291 to the phone to lay accusations against @entity1 before journalists			1
@entity1 , to her credit , sent @entity291 a birthday present last year , but it was returned to her unopened			1
she has survived a spat with @entity181 ’s new girlfriend , @entity310 , who blogged bizarrely : ‘ it ’s great that at 50 life can still grab you by the throat			0
’ @entity1 retaliated by posting a recipe for ‘ slut ’s spaghetti ’ and later insisted it was not a dig. the romance between @entity310 and @entity181 appears , after six months , to have lost its sparkle			1
@entity1 , meanwhile , remains alone , at times stunned by the force at which her once perfect public image has been shattered			1
to cheer herself up , she ’s planning a trip to @entity327 over @entity328 with friends			2
she remains philosophical about her setbacks and desires only to preserve a little dignity			0
as she wrote in a newspaper a few weeks ago , she has learned a tough lesson : ‘ perhaps the truth is that everything in life that matters — in the professional arena as with affairs of the heart — can not be planned			0

the celebrity chef , *53* , was pictured looking her age after being denied entry to the @entity23 over the *admission* she has taken cocaine
travel ban came as tv *bosses* decide whether or not to give her cookery show @entity70 another series
she is said to need a vast amount of money to maintain her lifestyle
but friends say @entity1 is feeling liberated since divorcing @entity97
