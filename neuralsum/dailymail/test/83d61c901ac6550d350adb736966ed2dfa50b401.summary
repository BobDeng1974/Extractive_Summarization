who does n’t love a hot cross bun at @entity2 ? in @entity4 we so enjoy the spiced , sweet rolls with a cross on top , that they used to be eaten all year round			1
that was until queen elizabeth i tried to ban them , possibly finding the cross a little too @entity12			1
the move was greeted with uproar , so she compromised , saying they could only be sold on @entity17 , at @entity18 and for burials — and they have been prime @entity2 fare ever since			1
nowadays supermarkets bring out ever more permutations to tempt customers , from miniature sizes to new flavours like toffee fudge chunk and apple and cinnamon			1
here is best of the batch this @entity2			1
@entity32 ( pictured ) has tested out the best hot cross buns on offer this easter @entity36 @entity37 , £ 1.50 for four nutrition : 198 cals , 11.5g sugar , 0.4g salt , 33.7g carbs , 3.2g fat these looked lovely and squidgy but were n’t big on flavour , sadly			1
nice , but slightly bland			2
3/5 @entity45 @entity46 , £ 4.99 for four nutrition : no details available four lovely , fat buns that look very attractive			1
they went a pretty shade of gold when heated and were delicious with some butter and strawberry jam			2
made for @entity46 by the @entity57 bakery in @entity58 , @entity59 , they ’re expensive , but worth it ( though i would n’t have minded just a tad more fruit )			2
4/5 @entity64 @entity65 , £ 1.60 for four nutrition per bun : 207 calories , 11.8g sugar , 0.35g salt , 33.5g carbs , 5.4g fat what looks like traditional raisins in these sticky buns is actually a generous serving of toffee , fudge and dark chocolate chips			1
i wanted to find these too sweet , but they were delicious			0
5/5 @entity82 @entity85 sir @entity84 ’s @entity83 , £ 5.95 for four nutrition : 320 cals , 17.2g sugar , 0.36g salt , 59.3g carbs , 6g fat @entity91 , fat , golden buns with the traditional white cross and a glaze of orange marmalade			1
slightly bitter , but in a good way ! toasted , they are utter perfection			0
5/5 @entity99 heston from @entity101 , £ 1.50 for two nutrition : 255 cals , 23.8g sugar , 0.5g salt , 46.9g carbs , 4g fat these big buns have a refreshing hit of ginger and a lovely sweet slick of honey			1
perfect with a cup of @entity113 , though they might scare traditional types			0
4/5 @entity116 @entity117 & @entity118 , £ 1.69 for four nutrition : 194 cals , 15.3g sugar , 0.37g salt , 30.7g carbs , 4.3g fat stuffed with vine fruits , hazelnuts and rolled oats , so they have a very different texture to regular hot cross buns			1
slightly chewy , they ’re more substantial than the others , but would be nice for breakfast with a little bit of honey			0
4/5 @entity134 @entity135 ’s of @entity136 , £ 6.25 for one nutrition : no details available this legendary @entity140 bakery never fails to disappoint			0
this bun is very large ( nearly 6in diameter ) so you may want to slice , toast and share it			0
with chunks of dark chocolate chunks and pieces of crystallised orange peel , it ’s the ultimate @entity2 treat			1
5/5 best for kids @entity153 , 99p for six nutrition : 151 cals , 7.9g sugar , 0.3g salt , 22.7g carbs , 5g fat smaller than average and absolutely stuffed with big chocolate chunks			0
they are delicious cold , and fantastic heated up			0
5/5 @entity162 @entity163 , 99p for four nutrition : 197 cals , 14g sugar , 0.35g salt , 34g carbs , 3.4g fat well - stuffed with fruit but a little dense for my liking			0
still , there ’s no arguing with the price and they brush up well after a few minutes in the oven and with some melted butter and jam			0
3/5 @entity178 @entity179 & @entity180 , £ 1.50 for four nutrition : 213 cals , 9g sugar , 0.4g salt , 30.8g carbs , 7.2g fat sticky , milk and white chocolate - stuffed buns that sound like a pudding but work as a bun			2
put your feet up and indulge ! 5/5 free from @entity190 @entity191 , £ 2.49 for four nutrition : 204 cals , 13.4g sugars , 0.33g salt , 34.8g carbs , 5.4g fat free from gluten , these are still beautifully spiced and the nicest of the free - from varieties i tried			2
4/5 @entity201 's choice @entity203 ’s @entity202 , £ 1.70 for four nutrition : 203 cals , 18.1g sugar , 0.47g salt , 36.5g carbs , 3.4g fat they look pretty , with jewel - like cranberries and fat golden raisins			0
though , if i ’m being really fussy , they ’re slightly dry so need a big dollop of butter			0
4/5 @entity215 - @entity214 @entity216 , £ 1.59 for nine nutrition : 88 cals , 7.5g sugar , 0.18g salt , 16.1g carbs , 1.4g fat the size of these is perfect for those who want a nostalgic @entity2 treat without the calorie content			1
moist and fruity , and the perfect portion size for children , too			0
5/5 traditional @entity229 , £ 1.60 for four nutrition : 209 cals , 19.5g sugar , 0.33g salt , 40.4g carbs , 2.4g fat @entity65 are rather good at doing seasonal treats like this , and their luxury offering this year is no exception			2
