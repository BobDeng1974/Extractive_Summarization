by @entity0 in addition to burrito bowls , @entity1 is now serving food for the soul as well			0
the chain started publishing the works of famous writers on their take - out cups and bags on thursday			2
author @entity11 came up with the idea for the fast - food flash - fictions while eating at a @entity1 restaurant , having forgot to bring a book or his smart phone to entertain him			1
@entity17 text : @entity1 is now publishing the work of famous writers on the side of its take - out cups and bags ' i really just wanted to die with frustration , ' @entity25 told @entity28 of the boring experience			1
@entity25 knew @entity1 ceo @entity30 , and pitched him the idea in an email			2
' i said , " i bet a shitload of people go into your restaurants every day , and i bet some of them have very similar experiences , and even if they did n’t have that negative experience , they could have a positive experience if they had access to some kind of interesting text , " ' @entity25 recalled			2
@entity30 went for it , and let @entity25 take charge of editing			0
in the end , he convinced writers @entity51 and @entity53 to get on board as well as journalists @entity55 and @entity57			1
flash fictions : the new cups and bags will feature the work of writers @entity11 , @entity51 and @entity53 as well as journalists @entity55 and @entity57 ' i selected the writers , and insofar as there was any editing , i did it , ' @entity25 said			1
' i tried to put together a somewhat eclectic group , in terms of styles			0
i wanted some that were essayistic , some fiction , some things that were funny , and somewhat thought provoking			0
' the new ' cultivating @entity76 ' cups debut thursday , but @entity51 , @entity25 and @entity57 ' contributions can be read now on @entity28 's website			1
@entity25 's collaboration with a fast - food chain is somewhat surprising considering he wrote ' @entity81 ' , an indictment of mass food production in the @entity84 , and is a vegetarian			1
however , he says the opportunity to get good writing into the hands of 800,000 @entity84 was a great opportunity			0
' a lot of those people do n’t have access to libraries , or bookstores			0
something felt very democratic and good about this			0
' unlikely collaborator : @entity25 's collaboration with @entity1 was somewhat surprising considering he is a noted critic of mass food production in the @entity84 , a topic he explored in his book ' @entity81 '			1
but @entity25 said the opportunity to get literature into the hands of 800,000 @entity84 was too good too miss			0

the idea for the new cups and bags came from author @entity11
@entity25 's work will appear on the bags in addition to writers @entity51 , @entity53 , @entity55 and @entity57
