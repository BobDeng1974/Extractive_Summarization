@entity23 : mother @entity12 , pictured left in 1883 , and @entity24 , right are among seven @entity13 set to be canonised by pope @entity14 on sunday mother @entity12 was known for her strength and kindness , battling bureaucrats in @entity28 as she led a group of fellow @entity31 nuns to care for leprosy patients in the islands			1

saving ms @entity38 's life almost 20 years ago paved the way for @entity12 's beatification in 2005 , and ms @entity41 's unlikely recovery was the miracle needed for her to be canonised			1
they were cured after friends and family prayed to @entity12			1
in @entity41 's case , a sister pinned a bag of soil containing some of mother @entity12 's bone fragments to her hospital gown			1
at the ceremony on sunday , presided over by the @entity14 , the church will also canonise @entity62 , a 17th - century @entity3 and daughter of a @entity64			1

@entity65 survived but was given the unfortunate surname because of her poor vision - as it literally means ' she who bumps into things '			1
sunday 's ceremony comes nearly a century after @entity12 's 1918 death at @entity90 , an isolated peninsula on @entity91 where @entity28 governments forcibly exiled leprosy patients for decades			1

she was the only religious leader in the @entity66 and @entity96 - of 50 asked - who agreed to a request by @entity28 's king and queen to come to the islands to help leprosy patients			1
saved : the @entity34 will formally recognise that @entity12 was responsible for the medically inexplicable recovery of @entity38 , pictured right , and @entity41 , left at the time , there was widespread fear of the disfiguring disease , which can cause skin lesions , mangled fingers and toes and lead to blindness			2
' i am not afraid of any disease , ' she wrote , agreeing to what would become a more than three - decade mission helping those banished to the unfriendly sea cliffs of the @entity117 peninsula			0
the @entity117 kingdom began exiling patients to @entity90 in 1866 to control the disease , a policy that remained in place until a century later even though new drugs in the 1940s made it curable			0
shortly after her arrival from @entity127 , @entity7 , she had learned that a government - appointed administrator was abusing patients at @entity131 in @entity132			2
mother @entity12 threatened to leave with the six sisters that accompanied her unless the government removed the official			1
the government soon gave her full oversight of the hospital			0
' she was just an ordinary person , like us , ' @entity140 , 67 , a retiree from @entity141 , told @entity143			0
' inside all of us , we can be saints			0
we just have to do the work			0
that 's what @entity12 did			2
' @entity65 found @entity147 as a teenager despite her @entity3 clan being vehemently against it			0
banished : children and adults stand outside @entity154 's church in the late 19th century when around 600 sufferers were shipped to the island after her family passed away , she was looked after by her uncle , a @entity160 chief who hated the religion , but a conflict moved her four miles north - west to @entity71 , @entity7 , aged 10			2
despite her disfigured face from smallpox , a number of men were interested in marrying her			0
but @entity65 decided to stay celibate because she believed they only wanted her for political gain			0
it was as she thought more about the potential of a loveless marriage , she started to find out about @entity147			0
her mother had given her a set of rosary prayer beads but her uncle had taken them away because he did not want her to become a @entity75			2
but she became more and more interested in the faith			0
@entity65 then began @entity75 teaching in secret aged 18			0
her uncle eventually allowed this as long as she stayed in their village			0
she was persecuted by her fellow villagers for joining the faith but soon escaped to the @entity185 - a @entity67 settlement			2
@entity187 : pope @entity14 , right , will declare the two women saints on sunday @entity65 was known for her gentleness , kindness , and good humour , according to the website of her shrine in @entity71			1
she vowed to stay a virgin for her whole life in 1679 in @entity67 and taught children to pray , as well as working with the elderly and sick			1
she died in 1680 after a serious illness and was buried in @entity199 , @entity67			1
she was said to appear to many people after her death and held responsible for miracles			2
legend has it that just minutes after she died she shone brightly and all the marks from smallpox vanished from her face , revealing her true beauty			0
@entity65 is highly - regarded in @entity75 because of her commitment to helping others despite all the persecution and illness she suffered herself			0
both women will be honoured during the ceremony in @entity16			0
two - hundred fifty pilgrims are travelling from @entity28 to witness the canonisation of @entity12			1
among those attending the canonisation are nine @entity90 patients			0
although cured , a dozen people still live at the peninsula , all older than 70			0
it will be the second trip to @entity16 in three years for @entity28 pilgrims			2
many made a similar trip in 2009 for the canonization of @entity154 , a @entity227 priest who moved to @entity90 to care for leprosy patients in 1873 and who died of the disease 16 years later			0
many are also making a pilgrimage to @entity21 , where @entity12 moved with her family from @entity234 in 1839 , aged one			2
at @entity236 and parish school , she developed her faith but left in eight grade to work in a factory after her father became ill. in 1862 , she entered the @entity242 in @entity127			0
bishop @entity243 said mother @entity12 's life has many lessons for people today , even though leprosy is n't a threat anymore			1
her example can be applied to other issues , such as domestic violence or homelessness			0
' she is an inspiration to us to do the hard work , to not always do the glory work , but to roll up our sleeves and do what needs to be done for the sake of our brothers and sisters , ' he said .			0

@entity11 cared for the elderly and sick in @entity7 and @entity67 until her death in 1680
