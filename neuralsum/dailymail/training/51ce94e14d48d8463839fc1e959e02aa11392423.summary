by @entity0 last updated at 4:09 pm on 16th november 2011 questioned : the £ 195,000 - per - year @entity2 boss @entity1 ministers have launched an inquiry into the watchdog which regulates hospitals and care homes over concerns that its failings have put patients at risk			1
officials from the @entity13 took action because of fears that the @entity2 was failing in its responsibility to carry out the inspections that can root out poor care			1
it follows growing criticism of the quango which failed to notice abuse of residents at the @entity24 care home in @entity26 for people with learning disabilities and took action only after undercover filming by the @entity33 ’s @entity32 programme			1
last week , the @entity13 ’s permanent secretary @entity34 called in @entity2 chief executive @entity1 for questioning over the organisation ’s perceived failings			1
a team of officials from the department also visited the quango ’s headquarters to investigate its operations			2
miss @entity1 is paid £ 195,000 a year and has one of the largest taxpayer - funded pension pots in the public sector			1
before taking up her post at the @entity2 she was head of the @entity48 health authority			2
her job there included supervising the performance of @entity52 , where hundreds of patients died needlessly in the @entity55 department			2
the @entity2 , which was set up by @entity56 in 2009 , is already under investigation by the @entity58 and the @entity59 public accounts committee amid growing concerns that the body is not fit for purpose to oversee 20,000 hospitals , care homes and clinics			1
two months ago the health select committee of @entity68 lambasted the @entity2 for neglecting its duty of scrutinising patient care in favour of tick - box ‘ registration ’ of care providers			1
' unforgivable ' : the @entity2 admitted a lapse of judgment over care of patients at @entity24 , pictured			1
it has now emerged it actually reduced inspections but claimed it had doubled them it emerged yesterday that in 2010/11 , the @entity2 carried out only 7,368 inspections and reviews – despite telling @entity84 in its annual report that the total was 15,220			2
the organisation has also cut down on the number of investigations it carries out into care scandals			2
over the last year it carried out just one – into @entity24 – compared to the 16 that the @entity92 , the @entity2 ’s predecessor , carried out in five years			1
miss @entity1 disbanded the @entity2 ’s investigations team soon after taking up her post – even though @entity48 bosses told her that failure to publicise examples of poor care could encourage complacency			2
there has been a staff exodus at the organisation , following claims by employees of a culture of bullying			0
this has made it harder for the @entity2 to carry out inspections			0
the @entity111 , which represents care home providers , has warned of the risk of a ‘ complete loss of confidence in the regulator throughout the sector ’			1
it told the health select committee : ‘ our members pay large amounts of money to be regulated and expect in return to be the subject of robust inspection and a critical friend relationship			0
‘ the reality is that now more than ever there is very limited inspection ; just a paper chase			0
’ a @entity13 spokesman said : ‘ it is essential that the @entity2 is performing to the highest possible standards			0
‘ we are currently carrying out a review to ensure that it is doing the best it can to protect patients			0
‘ the findings of the review will be made public in the @entity138			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity2 said : ‘ the review has been openly discussed with @entity2 stakeholders and staff , and we have found it an extremely helpful process			0
’ the @entity2 said the review was in no sense out of the ordinary , as all health quangos were undergoing a ‘ capacity and performance review ’			0
it has been announced in september			0
yesterday , health secretary @entity150 told @entity152 magazine that the review did not reflect a lack of confidence in the leadership of the @entity2 – and said it was now running a ‘ proactive and tough ’ inspection regime .			0
