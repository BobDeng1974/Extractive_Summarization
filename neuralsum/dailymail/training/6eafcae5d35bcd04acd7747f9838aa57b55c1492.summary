but after joining a slimming club two years ago they shed 14 stone between them and are now at their ideal weights for their wedding in march			2
@entity10 said : ' i could n’t bear people watching me eat because i was just worried they were thinking why is she eating all that when she is so fat already ? ' sometimes i would deliberately not buy any chocolate but by 7pm we would usually crack and drive to the garage which is literally a few minutes ’ walk away			1
' the couple , here holding their old trousers , used to eat garlic bread , two large pizzas , ice cream and three bags of chocolate in one evening , washed down with beer and wine @entity10 and @entity11 are set to tie the knot in a @entity62 themed ceremony in line with their love for camper vans , which @entity10 says may not have happened if they had n't lost weight			1
she said : ' i would have hated having my photos taken on my wedding day			0
in fact if i was the same size we would not be getting married			2
' there will be some very shocked friends at the ceremony - especially ones that have n't seen us for a while			2

the parents of @entity31 , six , and @entity88 , two , joined @entity89 in september 2011 and immediately began to shed their excess weight			2

' i went on the scales on the @entity85 but it only went up to 23st and then it told me to get off			0
' i did n’t think i could be heavier than that but when i did weigh myself i was 25st 4lbs			2
' @entity10 , who lost seven stone , added : ' i always knew i was overweight but until i saw a photo i did n’t realise just how bad i 'd become			1
' the hardest part was it was a photo with my two girls , one of whom was brand new , and i did n't want to show anybody because i looked awful			2
' i had always struggled with my weight but had just avoided having my pictures taken			0
' i have no photos with @entity31 when she was tiny because i did n't like having cameras anywhere near me			0
' it makes me say because i can never have that time back			0
