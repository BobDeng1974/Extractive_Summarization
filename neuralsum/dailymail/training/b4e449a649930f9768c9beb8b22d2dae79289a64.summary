a man has been jailed for nine years after he repeatedly punched an @entity2 migrant to the ground in a violent robbery in a train station alleyway , last october			1
@entity6 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , can be seen hitting the refugee so hard in his face that he required stitches in his left ear and lost a tooth , in @entity15 footage shown in court on thursday morning			1
while his victim was on the floor , the 26 - year - old continuously bashed the man as he tried to escape the unprovoked assault			1
the refugee had only been in @entity23 for five days after travelling from his native @entity24 - one of the most violent countries in the world - when he was set upon at @entity28 railway station , 82 kilometres south of @entity29			1
mr @entity6 then signalled for the man to come over to him , demanding his cash			1
however , the refugee speaks little @entity43 and did not understand the demands			2
mr @entity6 grabbed money from his backpack , prompting the victim to hand over a few coins from his pocket			1
his blonde friend @entity50 , 28 , hangs around in the background , reportedly acting as a lookout - unaware that the whole scene was being filmed on @entity15 anyway			0
during the mugging video , she strolls about in front of them in purple shorts before scarpering for a short period while mr @entity6 suddenly bashes the refugee to the ground			1
as the onslaught continues , the man can be seen begging for mercy as he is thrown about the alley by mr @entity6			1
trickery : mr @entity6 appears to chat with the man as he goes through his bag , while his blonde friend @entity50 , 28 , hangs around in the background as a lookout surprising : at the beginning of the @entity15 video it appears that the two men are just chatting like friends but mr @entity6 is actually demanding his victim 's cash a passer by sees the incident but fails to stop			1
when he is eventually free of his attacker 's clutches , he attempts to run away but falls to the floor before reaching the end of the pathway			2
mr @entity6 ' friend ms @entity50 then reappears in the video and the pair begin calmly collecting the victim 's belongings from the floor			1
the muggers got away with the man 's necklace , bracelet , sunglasses , headphones and $ 60 in cash			1
as the victim looks back one last time , mr @entity6 appears to shout something at him before strolling off			1
floored : the @entity7 man sets upon his victim without hesitation deceptive : it may look like mr @entity6 is bending down to help the man on the floor but he is actually just moving him so he can hit him again towering over him : the refugee cowers as he is violently assaulted ( left ) and grabbed by the neck ( right ) slammed : the victim is thrown once again onto the floor ( left ) and appears to beg for mercy ( right ) judge @entity110 said the shocking @entity15 footage was a reliable account of what happened during the violent assault			1
' a viewing of this footage is all that is needed to make an accurate assessment of the objective seriousness of this offence , ' he said , the @entity115 reported			0
the judge confirmed that the pair were waiting for their victim to reach the train station 's pedestrian walkway			1
' when the victim was stopped , it was also clear that there was a plan of action , ' he said			0
getaway : mr @entity6 eventually lets his victim run away from him strolling : the attacker calmly walks back to pick up the bag and the refugee 's possessions from the floor and ms @entity50 rejoins him he also revealed how mr @entity6 attempted to downplay the attack while speaking to a court - appointed psychologist			1
' he provides [ the doctor ] with a palpably false version of his confrontation and vicious assault on an unsuspecting victim , ' judge @entity110 said			2
mr @entity6 will be locked up for six years , back - dated to when he first came into custody at the time of the offence , and wo n't be eligible for parole in 2019			1
meanwhile , the woman seen with him in the video - ms @entity153 - will be sentenced on friday			2
the victim was a refugee from @entity24 , a country in the @entity156 that is bordered by @entity157 to the west , @entity159 in the south , and @entity161 in the east			0
the man had only been in @entity23 - supposedly a safe nation - for five weeks when he was violently set upon			2
his home country , which has a poor human rights record , is now in a fragile state of peace after more than 30 years of fighting			2
however , thousands are now fleeing due to a forced labour program that is spawning human rights violations , according to a report last month that will be debated next month at the @entity174			0
the @entity174 refugee agency @entity175 estimates that 2,000 people of @entity24 's 6 million population are fleeing every month			2
their relatives are forced to pay fines of 50,000 nafka ( about $ 3,607 ) for each family member who has left			2
most families ca n't afford the fine so a family member may be detained until the money is paid , or business licenses or property may be confiscated , the report said			0
the government began its program of national service , where people are put to work in reforestation , soil and water conservation and reconstruction , in 1995 but it has turned into an indefinite conscription , the report said			0
@entity24 emerged from its long war of independence in 1993 only to plunge once again into military conflict , first with @entity202 and then with its old adversary , @entity159			0
the country is ruled by president @entity205 , who has been in office since independence in 1993			0
national elections have been scheduled and cancelled - they have ever been held since the country became independent			0
people who practice ' unregistered ' religions , try to flee the nation , or escape military duty are arrested and put into prison			0
the religions that are allowed in the country are the @entity217 , the @entity218 , @entity219 , and @entity220			0
all other religions are persecuted and freedom of worship is one of the top reasons thousands of @entity24 flee the country			0
meanwhile , a 2011 @entity174 report estimated that about 70 per cent of @entity24 can not meet their food needs on their own			0
but the government insists @entity24 is self - sufficient in food and declines international food aid			0
domestic and international human rights organisations are also not allowed to function in @entity24			0
