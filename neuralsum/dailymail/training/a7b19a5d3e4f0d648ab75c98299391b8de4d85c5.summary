by @entity0 @entity1 : 19:42 est , 27 december 2013 @entity2 : 19:44 est , 27 december 2013 @entity3 today condemns @entity4 over an ' absurd ' proposal to bring dozens of new @entity7 human rights into @entity9 law justice secretary @entity3 today condemns @entity4 over an ‘ absurd ’ proposal to bring dozens of new @entity7 human rights into @entity9 law			1
if introduced , it is feared they could lead to a deluge of claims against businesses and the government			1
the rights are contained in the @entity20 ’s controversial @entity19			1
the @entity9 opted out of the charter in 1998 , but now the @entity22 has suggested it could be imposed on all member states			0
mr @entity3 said the suggestion showed @entity25 were aiming to create a @entity7 justice system that overrides domestic courts			1
‘ this country never wanted a charter of fundamental rights and the idea we would sign up to changes that meant it took over our domestic laws is absurd , ’ the justice secretary said			1
‘ the @entity22 should stop trying to create a @entity7 justice system , and should let member states get on with solving the real challenges we all face			1
’ his intervention marks a significant stepping up in @entity45 efforts to demonstrate how they want a looser , more trade - based relationship with the @entity20 ahead of the @entity7 elections in may			2
mr @entity3 ’s anger has been prompted by a document produced by the @entity22 suggesting that the charter should apply in all member states			1
the blueprint , which contains 54 provisions – including the right to strike and the right to collective bargaining – was attached to the @entity20 ’s controversial @entity57			2
the then pm @entity58 told mps it was ‘ absolutely clear that we have an opt - out ’ from the charter			0
but a new consultation document calls for it to be implemented throughout the @entity20			2
it says people ’s ‘ interests in and expectations about the enforcement of fundamental rights by the @entity20 are high ’			1
it goes on to suggest that ‘ one option would be to make all fundamental rights guaranteed in the charter directly applicable in member states			1
’ mr @entity3 's anger has been prompted by a document produced by the @entity22 suggesting that the charter should apply in all member states the @entity79 incorporated into our domestic law large parts , but not all , of the @entity83			1
some parts were deliberately omitted by @entity85			0
the @entity19 contains all of the missing parts and many further provisions			0
the new discussion document also suggests a stronger role for the @entity90 , though it concedes the steps proposed would require the agreement of member states			0
mr @entity3 said a @entity45 - led government would never agree to the proposal to adopt the charter			1
however , many of the rights in the charter would be greeted with delight by trade unions who are likely to pressure @entity103 to accept them			2
in the field of employment law , the charter guarantees rights in areas such as collective bargaining , unjustified dismissal , ‘ fair and just ’ working conditions and maternity and parental leave			2
mr @entity3 will play a key part in @entity45 efforts to rein in the influence of @entity7 human rights law , which has stalled under the @entity118 because of the fierce resistance of the @entity120			1
earlier this year , mr @entity121 also expressed concern about the potential influence of the charter the justice secretary is understood to be considering draft legislation setting out how a @entity45 - only government would replace @entity103 ’s @entity79 with a @entity9 @entity128 and reassert the authority of the @entity130 over the @entity7 courts			1
he argues that the creeping influence of @entity7 courts in @entity9 law is unacceptable and underlines the case for renegotiating @entity9 ’s membership of the @entity20			2
earlier this year , a senior judge also expressed concern about the potential influence of the charter			0
mr @entity121 ’s comments came in a judgment on the case of an asylum seeker whose barrister cited the document in a failed bid to win his case			0
the judge said he was ‘ surprised , to say the least , ’ by the claim , adding : ‘ i was sure the @entity9 government had secured an opt - out at the negotiations of the @entity57 ’			0
yet the @entity152 had suggested that the opt - out ‘ does not intend to exempt the @entity9 from the obligations to comply with the provisions of the charter ’			0
the @entity45 pledge is likely to be revived in the next @entity45 manifesto after being underlined by a draft @entity159			0
some @entity160 – including several cabinet ministers – want to go further and withdraw from the @entity83			0
last night a spokesman for the @entity22 said : ‘ this paper was published several months ago to stimulate debate at a conference in november			0
‘ it had a disclaimer saying it did not represent the position of the @entity22			0
changes to the @entity19 – which covers only @entity20 law – could indeed only be made if the @entity9 signed up to them			0

if introduced , it is feared they could lead to a deluge of claims against businesses and the government
