by @entity0 published : 20:01 est , 22 june 2013 updated : 03:01 est , 15 august 2013 two of the women accused of covering up a damning internal report into a failed hospital inspection insisted last night that they never wanted their names to be kept secret			1
@entity7 , former deputy chief executive of the @entity9 , and @entity10 , the watchdog ’s media manager , both insisted they wanted the truth to come out , despite allegations that they wanted heavy criticism of the @entity9 to be withheld from the public			1
in the explosive report about the cover - up published this week , the two women were initially referred to as ‘ @entity19 ’ and ‘ @entity20 ’ after lawyers warned that naming them could breach the @entity22 or lead to libel lawsuits			0
protected : @entity10 , the media manager of the @entity9 , was not initially named in a damning report into a failed hospital inspection this led to further accusations of a cover - up and political pressure forced the @entity9 to reveal their identities , along with those of then @entity9 chief executive @entity32			1
but now @entity33 , who lost her new job at internet firm @entity35 in the wake of the row , and miss @entity10 , who is on maternity leave , have condemned the botched attempt to anonymise the report as it made the story far bigger			1
miss @entity7 , former deputy chief executive at the @entity9 , said : ‘ it was very clear that the redaction was worthless			1
i feel that the @entity9 threw a scrap of information to the media and ensured there would be an extended feeding frenzy			1
‘ i believe the @entity51 report should not have been published in the way it was this week			0
’ miss @entity10 , due to return to the @entity9 as @entity54 next month , said : ‘ i thought it was a very poor decision to anonymise it in the first place			1
’ under fire : @entity32 , chief executive of the @entity9 , was ' round the table ' when the decision was taken to delete evidence of a botched @entity9 inspection asked if she felt like a scapegoat , she replied : ‘ i certainly feel extremely vulnerable and i ’m astonished that this has happened			1
that i could be on maternity leave and exposed to this , with absolutely no evidence at all			0
it ’s like living in a nightmare			0
‘ i did absolutely nothing wrong and i ’ve got evidence that i actually pushed for more scrutiny			0
’ the @entity9 had known as far back as 2009 that there had been 12 ‘ @entity72 ’ including child deaths at @entity74 in @entity75			1
but it only launched a full investigation into the @entity79 trust that runs the hospital in december 2011			0
consultants @entity81 said in a previously unreported review that ‘ there may have been an earlier missed opportunity ’ to intervene			0
astonishingly the @entity9 had no ‘ written record ’ of why it decided to investigate @entity79 , where some 38 babies were delivered stillborn between 2002 and 2009 , 15 more died in the first two weeks of birth and three mothers had died while pregnant or within a year of giving birth			1
the watchdog carried out an internal review of its earlier inspections , but it was never published			0
baby deaths : @entity95 being held by his sister @entity96 at @entity74 in @entity97			0
he died of an infection which could have been cured with antibiotics the latest high - profile account published by consultants @entity51 this week found that senior figures at the @entity9 agreed to suppress the account of their failings in monitoring @entity106 @entity105			2
but speaking separately to the @entity107 , @entity33 and miss @entity10 strongly rejected the claims against them			2
they say that rather than containing devastating revelations about the health watchdog ’s failures , the internal review actually blamed hospital managers			0
miss @entity10 said it was a ‘ whitewash ’ rather than a ‘ smoking gun ’			2
miss @entity7 said : ‘ i , and others , made it clear to @entity51 that we thought the document let @entity9 off the hook and we thought it could have been far tougher			1
’ the pair , interviewed separately by the @entity107 , deny there was any order to delete the review and stop it being published under freedom of information laws			0
poor care : the @entity9 had known as far back as 2009 that there had been 12 ¿ @entity72 ¿ including child deaths at @entity74 in @entity75 miss @entity10 said she had actually called for a better , external review of the @entity79 case last july and kept minutes of a meeting with new @entity9 chief executive @entity135 where she ‘ pushed very hard ’ for this			1
miss @entity7 said : ‘ there was no instruction to delete , but there was a need to do further work			2
’ employment lawyers are now looking into what action can be taken against the @entity9 officials , which could include stripping former chief executive @entity145 and her deputy @entity33 of their multi-million pound pensions			2
miss @entity10 is due to return from maternity leave next month but it is unclear if she will be able to return to her old job			2
the @entity150 have been asked by an mp to look into the alleged cover - up at the @entity9 while @entity153 are still looking into the death of one baby in the care of the trust , @entity95 .			0
