@entity2 's attorney @entity109 and prosecutors did not comment on @entity2 's disappearance because of a gag order , though @entity109 said he thought his client was in the bathroom when he did n't return to his seat			2

before @entity2 's brazen escape , the victim broke down in court as she watched a video of one of the painful attacks			1

in court yesterday , the middle school student , dressed in a plaid shirt and blue jeans and wearing a gold cross around her neck , described how @entity2 took her to a house in october 2010 where she had sex with multiple males			1

dirty : the attacks occurred inside an abandoned mobile home , pictured , police said she identified @entity2 in the film laughing in the background , telling the attacker to ' beat that ho			2
' ' did the guys just take turns with you ? ' prosecutor @entity167 asked			0
' yes sir , ' the girl said			0
the girl seemed calm for most of the roughly one and a half hours she testified			2

however , she had difficulty remembering names and exactly how all the assaults occurred , according to the @entity183			0
she described another alleged rape in november 2010 that started in a different @entity32 home the defendants called the ' boom boom ' room , according to prosecutors , and that continued later at a nearby abandoned trailer			0

' jurors were later shown police photos of used condoms and condom wrappers found inside and outside the house in the november incident			0

@entity201 , 22 , told jurors he saw @entity2 sexually assault the girl with a beer bottle			1
the other adult , @entity206 , 28 , and the teen testified they saw others assault the girl but not @entity2			1

during opening statements on wednesday , @entity167 told jurors he would present them with videotaped and written confessions in which @entity2 admitted to raping the girl			1
' what took place to this girl was nothing better than a pack of animals attacking , ' @entity167 said			0
the prosecutor added that while the girl may be seen smiling and even laughing at some times on the videos , these individuals had ' duped , tricked and talked her into doing things against her best interests , ' according to the @entity183			0
authorities say the then 11 - year - old was assaulted at least five times between mid-september and early december 2010 by a group of 20 males ranging in age from a middle school student to a 28 - year - old			1
the attackers filmed the girl being raped and took cellphone photos			2
on tuesday , a videotaped police interview in which @entity2 admitted he and eight other men took turns having sex with the girl , sometimes two at a time , was shown in court , although jurors were not present			1
alleged attacker : @entity265 , pictured , is one of the men accused of raping the 11 - year - old in the video , which @entity2 's lawyers argued should not be allowed as evidence , the 20 - year - old initially denied ever touching the girl , but he later broke down and told investigators he engaged in oral sex with her , according to the @entity183			1
he also said one of the others penetrated the girl with a beer bottle			0
on tuesday , @entity109 tried but failed to get the confessions thrown out , arguing that police improperly questioned @entity2			2
during his opening statement , @entity109 told jurors that the video evidence in the case does n’t show @entity2 having sex with the girl			1
' the truth in this case is not always what it seems , ' he said			0
he also said to jurors , regarding the video ' what you 'll see will not be pleasant but the most unsettling parts do not contain @entity2 having intercourse with this girl			1
' yesterday , @entity109 questioned how the girl learned @entity2 's name since she was only aware of his street nickname ' @entity299			2
' she told him she believed the first time she heard that name was from school police who were questioning her about the rapes , the @entity183 reported			0
two men and all six juveniles have pleaded guilty in the horrific case			0
a gag order has prevented prosecutors and defense attorneys from commenting about the case			0
@entity2 's trial , which is being held in the nearby county of @entity15 , is expected to yield further details about the attacks in coming days			0
the investigation into the shocking gang - rapes began in 2010 after one of the girl 's friends told a teacher he had seen a cellphone video that showed the 11 - year - old being raped in an abandoned trailer			1
those charged included two top athletes at the local high school and adults with criminal records			0
the case brought unflattering attention to @entity32 , a town of 9,000 people , after some residents suggested the girl was in part responsible for what happened , saying she wore makeup , looked older and was n't properly supervised by her parents			2
other community residents , as well as groups from outside of town , sharply criticised those suggestions			0
it has been complicated by a belief among many in the predominantly black neighborhood where several of the suspects live that the arrests were racially motivated			0

two other adults have previously pleaded guilty , with one receiving a 15 - year prison term and the other awaiting sentencing			0
