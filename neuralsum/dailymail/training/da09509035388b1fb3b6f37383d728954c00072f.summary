faced with the possibility that @entity2 may not come to an agreement to fund the @entity4 by friday midnight , president @entity0 on monday warned a group of governors on monday that temporarily shuttering the government agency 's doors ' will have a direct impact on @entity11 ’s national security			1
' and over the weekend while speaking at a briefing during the @entity15 meeting , homeland security chief @entity12 cautioned that ' we are greatly compromised ' by a shutdown			0
separately , the @entity18 argued on monday that the country could face ' irreparable harm ' if a @entity23 judge 's injunction on the presidents immigration orders were kept in effect			1
but the @entity26 on monday afternoon had a tough time detailing specific aspects of national security that would be threatened if either situation came to pass			1
@entity0 told warned the governors on monday that temporarily shuttering the @entity4 's doors ' will have a direct impact on @entity11 ’s national security ' with regards to @entity2 , the president said monday that if the legislative branch does n't send him a bill he can sign , more than 100,000 @entity4 employees , including @entity44 agents , port inspectors , and @entity47 ( @entity47 ) agents ' will show up to work without getting paid			1
' characterizing the dispute as another one of the ' manufactured crises and self - inflicted wounds ' imposed by @entity2 ' that have so often bogged us down over the last five years , ' @entity0 told governors on monday that workers are ' not going to be able to spend that money in your states ' if they do n't receive a paycheck			2
' it will have a direct impact on your economy , and it will have a direct impact on @entity11 ’s national security , because their hard work helps to keep us safe			1
' and as governors , you know that we ca n’t afford to play politics with our national security , ' he told them			0
congressional republicans are holding up funding for the @entity4 over the president 's november directive to the agency to stop deporting more than 4 million non-violent illegal immigrants who meet certain criteria			0
the @entity26 has passed legislation to give @entity4 the money to continue operations - but only if does n't enforce @entity0 's mandate			1
@entity81 have blocked the bill from proceeding through the @entity83 multiple times			0
they again filibustered the legislation on monday evening			2
the @entity26 has said it would veto legislation that undermines the president 's executive actions on immigration , anyway , putting another hurdle in the way of the @entity93 - backed bill			1
if the @entity26 and @entity83 do not pass identical legislation by a feb. 28 , a legally - mandated deadline imposed by @entity2 last december , or the @entity26 does n't approve the bill they come up with , @entity4 will partially shut down			2
all employees who are deemed non-essential will be sent home , and those that are seen as essential will be kept on the job without pay until the conflict is resolved			0
@entity103 reports that a @entity4 shutdown would have the immediate effect of 30,000 employees being sent home without pay			0
the news publication put the number of employees who would have to stay on - even though they wo n't be paid for that work until a later date - at 200,000			0
asked by @entity120 on monday afternoon what ' direct impact ' a @entity4 shutdown would have on national security , @entity26 press secretary @entity116 said , ' is that people who will be showing up to protect our borders , to protect our ports of entry including our airports , individuals who are responsible for keeping the machinery moving in terms of responding to natural disasters , and responding to requests for assistance from states when they put forward requests for financial assistance , that those kind of day - to - day operations are affected			1
' ' in some cases it just means that there is personnel who are not receiving paychecks			0
in some cases we 're talking about personnel who are working on these important matters who are being furloughed , ' he contended			0
he later told another reporter that just because some employees are categorized as non-essential , does n't mean they really are			0
these may not be people who are ' instantly recognizable to the @entity11 public , ' he said , but they do play an important role in protecting our @entity156			0
in his response to @entity120 , @entity116 said national security would also be threatened because @entity4 ' ability ' to plan for the future and to implement new procedures and programs ' would be negatively impacted			2
cyber security could also be threatened , @entity116 said , as that issue falls primarily under @entity4 's domain			0
' i think it 's very hard for anybody to make the case – and i do n't think anybody really has – that stopping funding for the @entity4 somehow enhances our national security , ' he told @entity120 during his daily briefing			2
' and i think everybody would acknowledge that it 's going to have an impact and it 's not going to be a positive one , ' which is why @entity2 should fully fund @entity4 for the full fiscal year , he added			1
at a press conference on monday @entity12 argued that cutting headquarters staff ' back to a skeleton ' would inhibit @entity4 ' ' ability to stay on top of a lot of the existing situations and challenges to homeland security right now			0
' homeland security secretary @entity12 , joined by the department employees , said monday that @entity2 to pass a full - year appropriations bill for @entity4			1
failing to fund @entity4 impacts our personnel and their families , he said in addition to national security regardless of whether @entity156 remains fully up and running it can not legally set to work on implementing @entity0 's mandates at present , because a judge in @entity23 last week granted 26 states - many of whom 's governors participated in @entity26 - sponsored events held in conjunction with the @entity15 meeting this weekend - seeking a reprieve a preliminary injunction that @entity156 has said it will abide by			1
the @entity18 on monday requested a stay from the judge , @entity209 of @entity210 , @entity23 , while it appeals his decision			2
@entity212 , a @entity93 - appointed judge , is not expected to cede the @entity0 administration 's request			2
in his earlier decision he said he believes the plaintiffs , @entity23 specifically , would ' suffer irreparable harm in this case ' if @entity0 's executive actions were allowed to take effect			1
the @entity18 said monday it believes that not allowing the @entity4 to proceed with its plans to place illegal immigrants who apply for the proposed programs under review would cause ' irreparable harm ' not only to those people but to national security			1
@entity26 press secretary @entity116 told reporters monday , ' the administration believes that a stay should be granted because the judge 's ruling in this case only makes it harder for the @entity4 to protect the @entity11 people and bring much needed accountability to our nation 's immigration system			1
' he argued that measures @entity0 put in place ' would bring greater accountability to our immigration system ' because they ' would bring millions of people out of the shadows , ' force them to pay taxes and to go through background checks			0
