she 's has her own clothing line , access to stylists and numerous designer contacts			2
but that does n't mean @entity6 always gets it right when it comes to her fashion choices			2
the reality star , 34 , caused a stir when she recently stripped off for @entity12 and it seems she can also fire debate when she has her clothes on			1
in a poll of women aged between 18 - 30 , respondents were asked to identify the mother - of - one 's top ten fashion fails			2
the unflattering gown was criticised for being too gaudy and looking like a set of curtains			2
some even went as far as to compare @entity6 to the character @entity23 thanks to the frumpy , floral number			1
one respondent said : ' i have to say that considering @entity6 probably has so many personal stylists , she never seems to get it right			0
that floral dress she wore to the @entity26 was absolutely awful			1
' she actually looked like the sofa i have in my living room , it 's exactly the same print			0
' @entity55 look : @entity6 with husband @entity56 during @entity32 in another dress paired with a gold choker necklace that failed to impress voters revealing : @entity6 's choice of outfit for this year 's @entity62			2
she admitted her style ' has become sexier since becoming a mum ' in second place was the unusual hole detail two - piece she wore at @entity32 earlier this year			1
despite being designed by @entity31 , respondents were n't convinced by the bizarre baby pink ensemble that was also seen on the catwalk modelled by @entity70			2
one person said : ' when @entity6 wore that weird two piece with holes in it , i genuinely thought she 'd lost the plot			0
who cares if @entity31 designed it â€“ it was hideous			0
' it just goes to show that it 's all about the brand and not the clothing itself , she is definitely just a fashion follower			0
' another recent fashion faux pas was @entity6 's salmon pink latex bodycon dress , worn to promote her latest perfume in @entity90 this month			1
the outfit tightly clung to her famous curves creating unflattering lines and creases and pushed her cleavage up			0
double denim has long been a fashion no - no so @entity6 was slated by voters for wearing denim jeans with a matching shirt earlier this year - with this outfit coming in fourth place in the poll			0
fashion faux pas : double denim , left , was another unpopular choice along with the princess @entity107 style colour blocking outfit worn in 2011 , right @entity109 was another outfit @entity6 chose whilst surrounded by fashionistas at @entity32			1
her choice of a white lacy maxi dress with a gold choker necklace did not make a good impression when she stepped out with her husband @entity56			0
four of the outfits which made the top ten were worn when @entity6 was pregnant showing she had difficulty nailing a chic maternity style			1
as well the floral gown , snakeskin peplum trousers and nude and monochrome dresses , all worn when she had a baby bump made the top ten			1
a mother who took part in the poll observed : ' @entity6 does look glamorous a lot of the time , but when she was pregnant she really had no idea			0
when i was having a baby , i just stuck to comfy clothes that were loosely fit			1
' she still tried to wear skintight clothes and shoes that made her look massive and must have been so uncomfortable			0
' maternity wear : @entity6 failed to flatter her baby bump in a nude maxi dress , left , monochrome gown , centre , and snakeprint peplum trousers , right in seventh place was a clashing colour block purple and orange dress @entity6 wore back in 2011 for another perfume launch while also making the top ten was a garish print mini dress with a plunging neckline she wore to the @entity62 this year			1
although the 650 voters were asked to pick @entity6 's worst outfits of all time , nearly half of the most unpopular choices were worn since the reality star has become a mother			1
in october , she told @entity160 magazine she has deliberately chosen raunchier outfits since @entity28 was born			1
she said : ' my style has become sexier since becoming a mum			1
you would think that i would tone it down and wear sweats and flats all day but i do n't feel good wearing that			0
' a spokesperson for @entity171 , who carried out the poll said : ' @entity6 is one of the powerful celebrity names in the world			0
with great power comes great fashion responsibility and she is guilty of letting her fans down one too many times			0
' many of her outfit choices have been questionable to say the least , sometimes simple is more effective			0

reality star , 34 , recently stripped off for @entity12 magazine
despite fashion contacts , she often gets it *wrong* when it comes to style
was compared to mrs @entity23 for gown worn to @entity26
struggled to find clothes to flatter baby bump when pregnant with @entity28
she has worn a number of revealing outfits since giving birth
' my style has become sexier since becoming a mum , ' she admitted
