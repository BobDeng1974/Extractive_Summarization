ambushed : @entity1 @entity0 , who was killed aged just 23 in the line of duty when she was gunned down by fugitive killer @entity4 in @entity5 two former @entity7 chiefs enraged frontline officers yesterday by opposing full life terms for police killers			1
moves to make such murderers die behind bars are a pr exercise and the ‘ contemporary version of hanging ’ , according to @entity17 and lord @entity18			1
but @entity19 , whose police colleagues @entity0 and @entity0 were shot dead in 2012 , said the peers should hang their heads in shame			1
‘ they sit in the splendour of the @entity26 and do so only by virtue of having had the honour of wearing the same uniform as those who have given their lives protecting our communities , ’ he said			1
‘ yet now they forget their roots and speak in defence of the rights of police murderers			1
’ the @entity40 chairman added : ‘ the men and women of our police service put their lives on the line every day to protect us all and need our protection			1
' an attack upon a police officer is an attack upon every decent citizen			1
’ @entity50 , who chairs the @entity51 , said there was an unwritten contract between our largely unarmed police service and the public			1
he added : ‘ society relies on police officers to get out there and protect them and they do that unarmed , but in return if somebody does kill a police officer they should die in prison			1
’ home secretary @entity65 revealed the proposed change in the law at the @entity40 annual conference last year			1
it was a popular move with rank - and - file officers			0
before the abolition of the death penalty , the murder of an officer was a ‘ capital homicide ’ with an automatic death penalty			1
mrs may said : ‘ we are clear – life should mean life for anyone convicted of killing a police officer			1
’ the current minimum sentence is 30 years and in some cases police killers have been told they will die behind bars			2
@entity4 , the 31 - year - old killer of @entity87 and @entity88 , was jailed for a whole life term in june 2013			0
but @entity91 @entity90 , 48 , who murdered pc @entity92 in @entity93 in 2003 by shooting him at point - blank range , had his whole life term overturned on appeal			0
the @entity97 later ruled he could apply for parole after 37 years , a decision which led one police leader to accuse the judiciary of having ‘ blood on its hands ’			2
lord @entity18 , left , branded the move to make police killers serve whole - life sentences ' unnecessary and populist '			1
@entity17 , right , said the change ' feels like a piece of symbolic , public relations legislation ' life tariffs are due to be enshrined in law in the @entity113 which is currently passing through the @entity26			1
but , during debates , @entity18 and @entity17 have both spoken out in strong terms to oppose the clause which introduces whole life tariffs			1
they were backed by @entity119 , who also served as a senior @entity121 officer , and lord dear , who led @entity123 for five years			1
lord @entity18 , whose tenure as @entity121 commissioner between 2005 and 2008 was dogged by questions about his judgment , leadership and politically correct style , branded the change ‘ unnecessary and populist ’			1
he said there was ‘ no evidence of judicial complacency ’ when it came to sentencing police killers			2
and he said a whole life term is the ‘ contemporary version of hanging ’ , adding : ‘ this measure is simply dangerous , unhelpful and totally misguided			0
’ @entity17 , who led the @entity121 for seven years until 2000 , said the change ‘ feels like a piece of symbolic , public relations legislation ’			1
he fears that a criminal on the run after a police murder might choose to ‘ shoot , stab or bludgeon ’ other officers as he has ‘ nothing more to fear ’			2
both men pointed out that @entity152 , who killed three police officers in 1966 , remains in prison and his accomplices have died			2
policing minister @entity156 said : ‘ we are making this change because we recognise the unique and dangerous job that police and prison officers do on a daily basis and we place the highest value upon their safety			2
' we recognise that the courts already treat these cases very seriously , and it will remain for them to determine the appropriate sentence in each case based on all the facts			0
but the government considers that the starting point in these cases should be a whole life order			2
’ the @entity113 has been working its way through @entity176 for several months			1
it is in the committee stage in the @entity26 , in which peers propose amendments			1
they will continue their work after the summer recess			0
@entity4 : killed @entity184 @entity0 , 23 , and @entity0 , 32 , while the subject of a huge manhunt after murdering a father and son			0
the officers died in a hail of bullets and even had a grenade thrown at them after @entity4 ambushed them in @entity5 in september 2012			0
the gangster , who has a false eye made of onyx , later handed himself in at a police station			2
he was convicted of all four murders , plus three attempted murders , and jailed for life			0
@entity90 : shot dead pc @entity92 after officers spotted he was driving a stolen @entity202 in @entity93 on @entity203 , 2003			0
@entity90 , an @entity91 , was eventually caught in a @entity205 hotel room			0
he was given a life sentence in december 2004 and told he will never be released – however , this sentence was overturned four years later			0
could be released in 2041			0
@entity208 : the jobless drifter stabbed wpc @entity210 , 25 , to death with a kitchen knife as she attempted to arrest him at a flat in @entity216 in october 1997			0
@entity217 , a schizophrenic with a pathological hatred of police , was detained indefinitely after admitting manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility			2
he was released in 2012 , with officials ordering that he be housed in an area with few police patrolling the streets in order to protect his mental health			2
@entity152 : the 78 - year - old is one of @entity232 ’s longest - serving and most notorious prisoners			0
he shot dead two officers , and an accomplice fatally shot a third , when his van was approached by plain - clothes police in @entity238 in 1966			2
the double - killer , who was jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum term of 30 years , remains in prison today			0
the slayings prompted calls to reintroduce the death penalty – abolished a year earlier – for those who kill police			2
in the wake of @entity4 's conviction , former @entity249 chairman @entity248 said it was time to think again of the ' deterrent effect of the shadow of the gallows ' calls to reintroduce the death penalty for police killers have been made repeatedly since the punishment was abandoned in the @entity260			1
many believe the decision to end capital punishment in 1965 came with assurances that those who murder police would die behind bars			0
as recently as two years ago – in the wake of one - eyed gangster @entity4 ’s murder of two @entity269 – senior @entity270 said criminals who target those protecting the public should face the ultimate punishment			0
former party chairman @entity248 said it was time to think again of the ‘ deterrent effect of the shadow of the gallows ’			0
his colleague @entity277 said : ‘ police officers potentially put their lives on the line every day , and therefore someone who murders a police officer should face the most severest of punishments			1
‘ whether that is a life sentence without the possibility of release or the death penalty is something that i believe @entity176 should debate , as there is a massive public interest in this			0
the fact is that these killers do n’t fear the law , and they need to			0
’ the @entity40 , which represents rank - and - file officers , has long called for the death penalty for police killers – or , at the very least , automatic whole - life tariffs			0
capital punishment was banned for an initial trial period in 1965 , with the last criminal hanged in 1964			0
the death penalty was formally abolished in @entity232 in 1969			0
there was concern at the time , however , that the punishment should be retained for certain forms of murder – including the killing of a police officer .			1
