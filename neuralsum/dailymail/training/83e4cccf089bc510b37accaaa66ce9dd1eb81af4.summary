by @entity0 published : 10:13 est , 8 october 2013 updated : 11:30 est , 8 october 2013 savvy customer : solicitor @entity2 , who has successfully sued @entity3 after discovering he was paying £ 700 more than the cheapest available ticket on his route a commuter who learned he could have saved £ 700 a year by using a loophole to buy his train season ticket from a different station has fought a gagging order and won a landmark legal battle			1
@entity12 lawyer @entity2 sued @entity3 ( @entity3 ) when he discovered he was not sold the cheapest available fare for his route into @entity15			1
mr @entity2 , who lives in @entity16 , found he could buy a £ 3,068 - a - year season ticket from @entity18 , which is closer to @entity15 , but it could still be used from his home station , saving him £ 700			1
@entity3 initially stood up to him and tried to hit him with a ' gagging order ' and settle out of court once he made his money - saving discovery			1
but he pursued them for the cash and after winning he is urging others to take advantage of his ruling and do the same if they are being ' ripped off '			0
' anyone who has bought a ticket in the past seven months should ask the company why they have been charged £ 700 more when they realised back in march a cheaper fare was available , ' he said			1
' it is outrageous that @entity3 have been selling season tickets for £ 700 more			1
i did not think it right that they could buy my silence			2
' passenger groups and unions today praised the commuter for his legal fight			0
@entity44 , leader of the @entity46 rail union , said : ' the most worrying part of this case is that @entity3 tried to buy mr @entity2 ' silence			1
' they were worried that thousands of other passengers would follow his example and buy season tickets £ 700 cheaper as well			1
' this is another example of @entity55 treating its passengers as cash cows			0
' big win : @entity2 sued @entity3 after he discovered he could buy a season ticket for £ 700 cheaper thanks to a legal loophole @entity62 , head of @entity63 , the rail travellers ' pressure group , said : ' passengers often say that they feel " ripped - off " and do n't trust the railway industry to sell them the best - value ticket			1
' if the industry is to rebuild passenger confidence , then it must act to tackle the complex and illogical fares system			0
' this must include making terms attached to tickets much easier to work out			0
' he added : ' we are disappointed to see that , in this case , the company continued to resist making a speedy apology and provide recompense to the passenger , when internally it had already accepted it was wrong			2
' mr @entity2 won the case at @entity86 , where a judge ruled the firm 's behaviour was unreasonable			1
the firm was also ordered to pay his costs of £ 2,193			2
bold : litigator mr @entity2 took the train firm to @entity86 ( pictured ) where a judge agreed that @entity3 had acted unreasonably @entity3 said yesterday that mr @entity2 had uncovered a ' previously unknown historic routing guide error ' , dating back to the days of @entity95			2
the firm said the @entity97 ( @entity97 ) was now taking steps to close the loophole			0
the rail company 's spokesman said : ' the @entity97 is closing this loophole on our behalf			0
we are not aware of any other anomaly and believe that this was an isolated case			2
' a @entity108 spokesman said it was still considering @entity97 's request			0
an @entity97 spokesman said : ' this is an example of a very obscure error in a system that offers millions of tickets for travel between more than 2,500 stations			0
