it was , in a nutshell , all you need to know about cricket ’s attitude to its ongoing fight against corruption			2
proof , if any were needed , that the priorities of the world governing body towards the biggest threat to the game ’s health and credibility are totally and woefully wrong			0
when @entity16 , who has remained invisible during his two - year reign as chief executive of the @entity19 , finally spoke about the latest crisis gripping the game late on tuesday , his words were revealing			1
this was not , as you might expect , recognition of the gravity of the issues enveloping @entity25 and @entity26 and a clear statement of the action that the @entity19 will soon take on the guilty players involved in match and spot fixing in numerous countries , including @entity33			1
instead , @entity16 ’s ‘ interview ’ with his own employers - hardly @entity47 - style interrogation , then - seemed intent solely on launching a ‘ thorough investigation ’ into how the testimony of @entity40 captain @entity39 , revealed in @entity41 by @entity42 , came into the public domain			1
finally : @entity19 chief executive @entity16 has broken his silence on recent cricket corruption scandals priorities : @entity16 is more intent on investigating how the testimony of @entity39 was leaked than fighting this blight on the sport no mention , you will notice , as to why the much - derided @entity19 anti-corruption unit have failed to land a significant conviction in 14 years			1
no mention about any positive action against those responsible for @entity26 ’s crimes			0
clearly , as far as @entity16 is concerned , cricket supporters should not learn about the depth of corruption in the world game from information leaked to journalists			1
so let ’s all shoot the messenger then , mr @entity16 , and give further ammunition to cynics who suspect the whole sordid business will be brushed under the carpet			1
by @entity16 ’s logic , journalists like @entity42 , the leading authority on corruption in cricket , and @entity77 , who revealed in december that @entity78 , @entity26 and @entity79 were being investigated by the @entity19 , should be hamstrung and the game will continue to give the appearance that it is wallowing in a mess of its own creating			1
if it were not so serious it would be laughable			0
it is worth remembering that cricket has almost always had to rely on outside influences to sort out its mucky affairs rather than taking strong , clear , decisive action of its own			0
controversy : @entity26 admits being involved in plans to fix games and more names are expected to emerge if it were not for the @entity99 police then @entity16 ’s old @entity96 team - mate @entity95 would never have been exposed as the calculating cheat that he was			1
and if it were not for the defunct @entity104 newspaper then it is almost certain that @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 would never have been held to account for the offences that led to them going to prison in @entity33			2
even the conviction of @entity112 for spot fixing in county cricket came about only when his then @entity116 team - mate @entity115 bravely stepped forward to expose his friend rather than through detective work from the @entity19			1
if the authorities could be trusted to bring the guilty to account then there would be no need for leaks and no need for sports journalists to become involved in the most difficult story - gathering process in our profession			0
shoot the messenger : it took a newspaper investigation to lift the lid on offenses committed by former @entity133 cricket captain @entity105 ( right ) , who was convicted and jailed for match - fixing offences but leaks happen for a reason and journalists need to be ever vigilant because administrators simply can not be trusted to weed out the wrong - doers			1
those who run the game should spend less time being outraged about the morality of leaking and reassuring its ‘ stakeholders ’ and more time fretting about the fact that others feel the need to leak in the first place			2
you are not the only one who is ‘ deeply concerned ’ , mr @entity16			1
the majority of us are deeply concerned about what you and your sorry organisation are doing about corruption in cricket			2
only when proper convictions come can you start attacking those who seek to reveal the full extent of the sickening problem			0
the @entity160 may have been full on tuesday but there are likely to be plenty of empty seats on thursday - and at most grounds hosting @entity166 this early season			0
the @entity167 will ignore attendances at their peril			0
yes , @entity33 are coming off the back of the winter from hell and , yes , they are lacking , for now , the sort of star quality that @entity175 in his pomp could produce			0
but there is more to it			0
star power : @entity181 's side and their opponents @entity166 lack box office drawcards the cost of watching @entity33 is high and there is simply too much international cricket			0
a consequence is that @entity33 have had to rest some of their best players , hence the public ’s reluctance to commit to 50 - over games before they are sure who ’s playing			2
it is not just on the field that @entity196 cricket may have become complacent before the @entity198 horror show .			0

@entity19 *ceo* @entity16 is launching a ‘ thorough investigation ’ into how the testimony of @entity40 captain @entity39 became public
@entity19 anti-corruption unit has *n't* led to a significant conviction in 14 years
@entity206 says corruption scandal is a ' total *embarrassment* '
