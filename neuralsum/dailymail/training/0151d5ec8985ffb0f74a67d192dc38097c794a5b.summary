pre-flight checks : the former @entity1 man is readied for action before he plunges back to earth from 13,000 feet ' in all honesty it 's a good job that today was the first time			1
' it would have been a nightmare trying to open up the hatches and jump out of the plane back then			2
' i 'm so glad i 've managed to complete the dive and i 'd love to do it again in the near future			0

' but i 've had great support from my family and friends who always encourage me to enjoy life			0
' i 've been to so many countries during my life and i want to tick off as many more as i possibly can in the future			0
' i would n't mind giving this another go - there 's no better feeling for me than being up in the sky			0
' some of the views were phenomenal but it 's a good job i had my goggles on as it was incredibly windy			0
