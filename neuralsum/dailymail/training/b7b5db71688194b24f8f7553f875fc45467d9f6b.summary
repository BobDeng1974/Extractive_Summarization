despite claiming that the surgery was needed to make her feel ' womanly ' , the aspiring glamour model says she 's now so desperate for a reduction , she 's turned to escorting to pay for it			2
this time , however , @entity7 , 23 , plans to pay for the operation herself after a cancer scare made her change her mind about wasting @entity5 funds			1
new leaf : ms @entity7 says she has turned to escort work in a bid to refund the @entity5 for her boob job ' i 'm desperate for a boob reduction and i feel so bad about using @entity5 funds for my breast enlargement , ' said @entity7 , who lives in @entity25 with her two sons			1
speaking to @entity28 , the former shop assistant added : ' i 'm raising cash from escorting to pay for it			0
' and escort work appears suit her , with ms @entity7 describing it as ' a great job ' and claiming that the toughest part is trying to avoid falling in love with clients			2
