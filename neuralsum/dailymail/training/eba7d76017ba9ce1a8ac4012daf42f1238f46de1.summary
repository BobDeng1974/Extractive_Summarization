it was only when i arrived in @entity2 with my girlfriend at the end of last year that i realised how tired i was			1
what a year ! after @entity11 silver , two medals in the @entity7 and my five medals in the @entity9 , what more could i ask for ? it was great to round the year off with a fantastic holiday			1
then , of course , there was @entity16			2
thankfully , it was n’t during competition period so i could eat as much turkey and stuffing as i wanted … within reason			0
i 've also been involved in some exciting events with my sponsors , who – like the @entity23 – have supported me a lot in my career			1
now , though , with the @entity29 and @entity30 championships coming up next month , the hard work starts here			0
i ’m back in training , mostly working on new skills and stamina before i build up to routine work			0
it ’s hard work and long hours , but i enjoy it			0
plus , it ’s essential if i ’m going to beat my personal all - around best of 90.6 next month			2
@entity39 competes in the men 's @entity40 at the 2014 @entity9 in @entity42 @entity39 with his @entity44 silver medal , finishing behind @entity45 of @entity46 getting to and from the gym is a lot more convenient since i moved to @entity49 late last year – now it ’s just a 10 - minute drive , rather than an hour ’s commute			1
i ’m not quite an @entity54 boy just yet , though - still @entity55 at heart ! the @entity29 and @entity30 championships will be a great chance for me to test out some new routines			2
i ’m feeling good about them at the moment , but i ’ve still got a lot of work to do in the next few weeks			0
hopefully i can pull it off			0
i had a mixed time in my last competition – the @entity44 in october			1
i had trouble at the beginning , and i think it was down to my mindset – i was taking it too seriously , rather than looking to enjoy the experience			0
i think , after having such a great year , i was putting to much emphasis on rounding it off as well as possible			2
it was probably the steepest learning curve i ’ve had in my career so far			1
luckily , i got a second chance and refocused for the final to pick up a silver medal			1
but more importantly , it taught me a valuable lesson for the future			0
in total , @entity39 won five medals at the 2014 @entity9 in @entity42 the 22 - year - old competing on the parallel bars at the @entity9 money raised by @entity23 players has been changing lives for 20 years - £ 32 billion has gone to sport , the arts , charities and heritage projects across the @entity30 .			1

@entity39 enjoyed a *successful* 2014 , winning eight medals in total
the 22 - year - old picked up a silver medal at the @entity44
@entity39 feels it was the steepest learning curve of his career
