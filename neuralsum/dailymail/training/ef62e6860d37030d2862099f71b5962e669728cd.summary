she 's a squeaky - clean pop star who sings about young love and yearning			2
but when @entity3 wanted to sing about @entity4 she joined the ranks of artists such as the @entity7 and @entity8 by being censored by the @entity9			1
@entity3 was asked to re-word her gentle love song @entity10 for an appearance on the @entity12 on @entity13			1
censored : @entity3 and @entity14 were baffled at being ordered to censor the lyric about @entity4 it refers to putting on @entity18 trainers to run across the water to a yearned - for love			1
the 25 - year - old singer - songwriter said : ‘ i had to change the lyrics from “ sometimes i wish i was @entity4 , i ’d get my @entity18 on and run across the sea for you ” to “ sometimes i wish it was easy to get my @entity18 on and run across the sea for you ”			1
‘ it was weird because i ’m not being blasphemous , i just meant “ i wish i could run across water and see you ” , but maybe wishing for the power of @entity32 was blasphemous enough for them			2
’ the decision left @entity14 mystifed , given some of the songs he is allowed to play on his show			1
he said last night : ‘ lyrics and the @entity9 have always bamboozled me			2
we often play @entity41 ’s @entity42			2
check out the lyrics in that song			0
’ the singer - songwriter said she is not blasphemous , simply wanted to use the religious reference as a metaphor the gentle song @entity10 , in the album in your hands , is about love and yearning the 1972 track touches on transexuality , drug use , and mentions a lewd sex act			1
the censorship of @entity3 ’s song angered former archbishop of @entity60 , who said : ‘ i am totally appalled			1
i ’m not surprised the @entity9 is behind this because their attitude tends to be to dumb down the @entity64 message			2
‘ i am sorry the lady agreed to this because the sense of the song is lost			0
walking on water and @entity4 go together			1
’ the @entity9 ’s decision is the latest in a series of pc judgments affecting artists and even the @entity75 ’s own broadcasters			0
in 2011 there was uproar over reports that @entity79 had been asked to use obscure terms like ‘ @entity81 ’ and ‘ before @entity81 ’ , rather than @entity82 and @entity83 , so as not to offend non-christians			0
at the time commentators pointed out that in 2,000 years the use of ad and @entity83 had never caused offence			0
shocked : @entity60 , former archbishop of @entity88 , blasts the move for dumbing down @entity64 last week the @entity9 was forced to defend a decision by the makers of the @entity92 show @entity93 to postpone a discussion about being gay and @entity96 after concerns were expressed by community leaders at the @entity100 mosque the show was being broadcast from			1
the @entity7 ’ single @entity102 was banned completely from airplay in 1977 – the @entity104 year – while gay anthem relax by @entity8 was banned in 1984			0
@entity3 added : ‘ i think people are a bit touchy , but it ’s not a big deal			0
i do n’t take that stuff seriously			0
’ a @entity9 spokesman refused to shed any light on the incident , saying : ‘ we never ask any artist to change the lyrics to their songs			1
‘ it ’s the decision of the record company and the artist			0
we have clear editorial guidelines in place to deal with religious or contentious issues and to avoid causing offence to our audiences regardless of their faith			0

@entity128 told to change line in @entity10 for radio appearance
' sometimes i wish i was @entity4 ' became ' sometimes i wish it was easy '
@entity14 baffled as he can play *controversial* songs about sex or drugs
former archbishop @entity60 blasted move but said he is ' not surprised '
