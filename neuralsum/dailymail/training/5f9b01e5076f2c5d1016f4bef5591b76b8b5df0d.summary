by @entity0 @entity1 : 13:01 est , 27 december 2013 @entity2 : 15:50 est , 27 december 2013 in business you have to spend money to make money and apparently in law enforcement , you have to allow crimes to catch criminals			0
according to documents obtained by the @entity13 in a @entity15 request , @entity11 agents authorized informants to break the law at least 5,939 times in 2012			1
the bureau was mandated to supply the @entity20 with these statistics annually more than 10 years ago after it was revealed that mobster @entity23 was a snitch - but the numbers were never made public until earlier this year , when @entity27 made the first @entity15 request for the documents			1
track records : when it was revealed more than 10 years ago that mobster @entity31 was a snitch , the @entity11 was mandated to keep track of illegal activities they authorized informants to commit			1
above , @entity31 in court on november 13 , 2013 the national newspaper requested every report since 2006 , but @entity11 officials were only able to locate 2011 's report - which showed that agents authorized 5,658 ' otherwise illegal ' activities that year			1
the crimes range from bullying and selling drugs to planning robberies and agents authorize an average of 15 authorizations a day			0
' it sounds like a lot , but you have to keep it in context , ' @entity48 , a retired @entity11 employee who used to supervise criminal investigations , told @entity27			2
' this is not done in a vacuum			0
it 's not done randomly			0
it 's not taken lightly			0
' the @entity11 numbers are likely just a small part of the picture			2
the bureau accounted for just 10 per cent of the criminal crimes prosecuted in federal court in 2011 and most cases are filed by state and local authorities who have their own separate sources			0
@entity69 , a spokeswoman for the @entity11 , refused to answer questions from @entity27 , but said that the circumstances around illegal activity authorizations are ' situational ' and ' tightly controlled '			1
allowing it : the @entity11 authorized informants to break the law at least 5,939 times in 2012 for the most serious crimes , agents are first supposed to get permission from federal prosecutors before authorizing			1
but an inspector general report in 2005 found that the @entity11 regularly failed to follow its own rules			1
still , the @entity11 is one of the only government agencies to keep track of this information			2
when asked by the newspaper , the @entity88 and the @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 said they could not determine how often their informants were allowed to break the law			0
the @entity11 could face new protocols soon as congressman @entity97 , a @entity98 representing @entity99 , is currently sponsoring a bill which would require federal agencies to notify legislators about the most serious crimes their snitches commit .			0

the @entity11 supplies the @entity20 with a list of authorized ' otherwise illegal ' activities committed by informants every year
the mandate was put in place after it was revealed that mobster @entity31 was a bureau snitch
according to the @entity11 's report for 2012 , informants broke the law at least 5,939 that year
