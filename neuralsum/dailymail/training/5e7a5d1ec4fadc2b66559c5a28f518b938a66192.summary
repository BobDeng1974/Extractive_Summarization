@entity0 and @entity1 believe a daily squabble between husband and wife always clears the air - and think other married couples should heed their advice to help wedded bliss			1
although @entity0 and @entity1 's exchanges are rarely anything more serious than him leaving doors open and she ' always being right ' , they believe that a few cross words have made them closer over the years			1
clearing the air : @entity0 and @entity1 believe a daily squabble always clears the air and @entity0 , 93 , says there 's nothing better than to say those three special words : ' you 're right , dear			1
' ironically the couple , who have been affectionately nicknamed ' @entity45 and @entity46 ' met in 1942 following another argument - this time between @entity0 and a love rival about who should ask @entity1 for the last waltz at a town hall dance			1
since then their marital @entity52 has continued with @entity54 - born @entity0 and @entity55 - born @entity1 , 89 , bickering over who left the lights on and whose turn it was to tidy up			1
the golden oldies celebrated their sapphire wedding anniversary with a family party at a hotel in their hometown of @entity64 , @entity65 last weekend			0
@entity1 , 89 , said : ' we only bicker over silly things really - but i do think those little rows keep us happier because everything is in the open			2
the little things : the couple are celebrating their 70th wedding anniversary and attribute their long marriage to having an argument every single day , even over little things ' there are no secrets between us and nobody is brooding or sulking			2
we have a little disagreement and then we move on			0
' we usually have little arguments about whose turn it is to tidy up			0
@entity0 also has a thing for leaving doors and drawers open , as well as constantly leaving lights on			2
' i 'm always pulling him about it and i think he only has a moan when i moan at him - but that 's just because he knows i 'm right			0
' longevity : the couple first met in 1942 at a dance at the town hall ( where they had an argument over who would dance with @entity1 ) dance partners : ' we met in the town hall at a dance			1
i used to love dancing and that was something we used to do often in those days ' said @entity1 the couple first met in 1942 at a dance at the town hall in @entity111 near @entity112 when @entity0 was stationed from his role as an anti-tank rifle operator with the @entity115 during @entity116 , and @entity1 worked in an aircraft munitions factory			1

family : couple have 10 grandchildren and 16 great - grandchildren ' @entity0 asked if he could have the last waltz and i said yes			1
it turned out that he was arguing with a friend over who would ask me and @entity0 won - so you could say we even met because of a row			2
' she added : ' i remember getting married like it was yesterday			0
it was snowing and we could n't have our pictures taken so we had to wait till later at the reception to have them taken - i 'm sure there were a few words exchanged between us then			0

' @entity146 takes me out quite a bit and @entity0 likes to go out on his mobility scooter when he can so we have a little time apart to do our own things			0
' ' despite our little tiffs we are still as firmly in love now as we were back them			0
i do n't think the majority of people these days who are getting together will last like we have			0
' the problem is it 's too easy for people to pack marriage in rather than stay together now and give it a go			0
' when @entity0 tells me off for not putting things away after i 've used them i just tell him i 'll put them away when i 'm good and finished with them			2
