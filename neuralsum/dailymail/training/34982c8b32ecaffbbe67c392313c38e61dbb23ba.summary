despite being told that the girl had only met her future husband once , the cleric condoned making her move in with the man against her wishes , claiming ‘ everything is jaiz ’ , meaning lawful			2
@entity25 , who has previously spoken out against forced marriage and advised @entity107 police on community outreach , admitted that he would not be able to attain a @entity32 wedding certificate , but added : ‘ we ’ll make everything ok by @entity1			1
