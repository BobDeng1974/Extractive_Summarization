by @entity0 published : 17:01 est , 6 november 2013 updated : 18:37 est , 6 november 2013 using touch screen computers has helped a group of monkeys relax , a new study has found			2
interacting with the touchscreen machines not only interests and challenges the animals , but keeps dominant members of the group busy , which mirrors life in the wild and relieves social tension			2
researchers studied a social group of @entity15 crested macaques at @entity17 , @entity18 , to come up with their findings			1
researchers studied a social group of @entity15 crested macaques at @entity23 to come up with their findings			1
here , one of the dominant monkeys relaxes by playing with the touchscreen the scientists , from the @entity28 , taught the rare monkeys to operate computer touchscreens so they could conduct studies to understand the animals ' cognition and communication			1
the researchers found that providing cognitive challenges for the macaques , using touchscreen computers , has improved the group ’s cohesion and reduced tensions while increasing friendly behaviour			1
lead scientist on the study , @entity45 , from the university ’s @entity46 , said : ' having one individual leave the group mimics conditions in the wild when it ’s common for a lone macaque to break off and return later			2
the researchers found that providing cognitive challenges for the macaques , using touch screen computers , has improved the group ¿ s cohesion and reduced tensions while increasing friendly behaviour natural habitat : @entity62 forest and mangrove swamps diet : bark , roots , bulbs , fruit and leaves ; also , insects and other invertebrates , small reptiles and birds ’ eggs behaviour : the monkeys live in small groups on the forest floor			1
they signal to one another by using a variety of calls , facial expressions and by raising and lowering their crests threats : hunting for food and habitat destruction ' at @entity17 it ’s usually the dominant macaques leaving the group to use the touchscreens , which leaves the others to enjoy some time without the top ranking animals			1
' just like humans and many other primates , macaques use complex social interactions			0
@entity15 crested macaques , native to @entity99 , employ sophisticated and subtle communication techniques , relying on many different facial expressions , body positioning and vocalisations to make themselves understood , according to the study published in the journal @entity107			1
mr @entity45 said : ' we can use our understanding of their social behaviour to work out whether taking part in the studies is affecting their welfare			0
' the research shows that when dominant individuals leave the group , the ‘ lipsmacking ’ behaviour of the other macaques increases – where they protrude their lips and then smack them together repeatedly			0
the monkeys were able to choose between images and videos of their species displaying different facial expressions mr @entity45 said : ' this behaviour is a friendly gesture between the macaques , which they use to maintain their social bonds			0
' the fact that this increases on days when they are taking part in our studies , shows that our research is having a positive effect on the group			0
' the macaques live in their social group and can voluntarily enter a specialised research area , separate from the researcher			2
the animals are free to end the sessions whenever they like and return to their daily activities			0
they receive food treats – tiny amounts of healthy titbits – when they take part in the studies			0
the scientists plan on using their understanding of the monkey 's social behaviour to work out whether taking part in the studies is affecting their welfare			0

university of @entity163 scientists taught macaques to use *tablets* so they could understand the animals ' cognition and communication
they studied a social group of @entity15 crested macaques at @entity17 , @entity18 , and found they exhibited friendlier behaviour
providing cognitive challenges for the macaques such as using touchscreen computers , improved the group ’s cohesion
