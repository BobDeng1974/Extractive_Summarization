the @entity0 has pulled an episode of its popular children 's show @entity4 , after thousands of parents complained the storyline ridiculed young people with food allergies			1
during the may 17 installment titled @entity10 , a nine - year - old character named @entity12 stated that he could not eat plain flour pancakes because he was gluten - free			1
instead of supporting his needs the rest of the cast made snide remarks and one child even threw pancakes in his face			2
in just a few days it attracted 2,137 signatures			1
the online appeal was started by mother - of - two @entity37 from @entity38 , @entity39			1
both her son @entity40 , eight , and daughter @entity41 , 11 , were diagnosed with celiac disease 18 months ago			2
the digestive disorder triggered by consumption of the protein gluten , which is primarily found in foods such as bread and pasta , causes damage to the small intestine and stops the body from absorbing nutrients from food			2
unpleasant symptoms include abdominal pain , weight - loss , fatigue and diarrhea			2
there is no cure and the only known effective treatment is a lifelong gluten - free diet - meaning any foods or products containing wheat , rye and barley should be avoided			1
' we need to stress that being gluten - free is to keep our kids safe , it is not a " trend " or " fad " ' mrs @entity37 said that her children were distraught after watching the @entity4 episode which ' made fun of , humiliated and isolated ' the gluten - free child			1
expressing her outrage on her change.org page she wrote : ' in the @entity4 episode , a young boy was said to require a gluten - free diet			1
' the other characters snickered at this requirement , and in fact threw a pancake at the child , which could have actually triggered a severe skin rash known as dermatitis herpetiformis			2
' the boy was made to be annoying , sniveling , and demanding , repeatedly teased and excluded by the other children			2
outrage : @entity37 , pictured with husband @entity89 , said that their children , @entity40 , eight , and @entity92 , 11 , were distraught after watching the @entity4 episode - both have celiac disease and eat a gluten - free diet ' for my kids , this is real			1
they have had friends make fun of their food , been disinvited to parties because of their diet			0
' they have been made to sit alone , have had waitstaff roll their eyes and snidely comment about their requests to make their food safe for them to eat			0
' another mother , @entity109 from @entity110 , @entity111 , was equally offended			0
she added : ' my son is gluten - free due to being @entity114 to gluten / wheat / oats / barley			1
' i guarantee if it was a peanut allergy , they would n't have had them throwing peanuts at him ' ' he is severely allergic and an exposure is potentially fatal			0
this is my husband and my daily worry , that he will be " poisoned " by a bully			0
' we need to stress that being gluten - free is to keep our kids safe , it is not a " trend " , " fad " [ but ] a means to keep our children safe			1
' a thread started on the website @entity134 also touched on the issue			0
one commentator simply stated : ' i guarantee if it was a peanut allergy , they would n't have had them throwing peanuts at him			0
' in response to the backlash , the @entity0 network has now pulled the episode from air			1
a statement on its official @entity149 page posted last friday read : ' to our viewers , we received your feedback about tonight 's ' @entity4 ' episode which some of you accessed early on @entity157			0
insensitive : at one point a cast member throws pancakes at the gluten - free child ' we are removing this particular episode from our regular programming schedule and will re-evaluate its references to gluten restrictions in the character 's diet			1
' please accept our apologies for the upset this episode caused you and your family			0
we value your feedback and thank you for watching @entity0			1
' a 2012 study estimated that around 1.8 million people in the @entity176 have celiac disease , and 1.4 million may not even know about it			0
while gluten - free diets are necessary for people with celiac disease , they have also become a fad diet for some with about 1.6million excluding gluten from their diets for no medical reason			1
people who do not need to be on the strict diet may develop vitamin deficiencies and other side effects			0
celiac disease is a digestive condition triggered by consumption of the protein gluten , which is primarily found in bread , pasta , cookies , pizza crust and many other foods containing wheat , barley or rye			2
people with celiac disease who eat foods containing gluten experience an immune reaction in their small intestines , causing damage to the inner surface of the small intestine and an inability to absorb certain nutrients			2
celiac disease can cause abdominal pain and diarrhea			0
eventually , the decreased absorption of nutrients that occurs with celiac disease can cause vitamin deficiencies that deprive your brain , peripheral nervous system , bones , liver and other organs of vital nourishment			0
no treatment can cure celiac disease			0
however , sufferers can effectively manage the condition by changing their diet			0

a change.org petition calling on @entity0 to ' stop bullying gluten - intolerant characters ' attracted 2,137 signatures
