by @entity0 published : 03:55 est , 14 december 2012 updated : 03:58 est , 14 december 2012 the lyrics are familiar from a thousand nativity plays and christmas carol services			0
but what do the words to @entity4 mean exactly ? that is the question pondered by television historian @entity8 after she attended this year 's annual carol service at @entity10 , @entity11			2
confusion : @entity8 , a professor in classics at @entity11 , wrote about the ' weird ' @entity4 lyrics in a newspaper column the historian , a professor in classics at @entity11 , wrote about how she was struck by the phrase ' no crib for a bed ' as she perused the lyrics printed in her order of service			2
writing in her column in the @entity25 , professor @entity8 said of the printed lyrics : ' it did make you reflect on what made a good carol , what was the right blend of sentimentality and jolliness			0
' it also made you reflect on how weird some of the words were ( what actually does " no crib for a bed " mean ? ) , ' she added			1
carols : the historian attended this year 's @entity10 carol service in @entity11 ( file picture ) the confusion is thought to arise from the fact that - at least in @entity48 - a crib and a manger are essentially the same thing ; a trough from which an animal can eat fodder			1
meaning interpreting the phrase ' away in a manger , no crib for a bed ' could present something of a conundrum			1
but in the @entity60 , where the carol was first published in @entity62 in 1885 , a crib is defined as a small bed for infants and young children			0
one reader posted a reply to professor @entity8 's column which said : ' i think we must apply a principle of charity and interpret the words in a way that makes them sensible			0
' as a manger has just been mentioned , we must take " crib " to have only the meaning of a proper little bed designed for children			1

in @entity48 , the words ' manger ' and ' crib ' can mean the same thing ; a trough from which an animal can eat
