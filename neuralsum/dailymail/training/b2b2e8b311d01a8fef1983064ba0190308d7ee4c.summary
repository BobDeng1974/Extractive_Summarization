police released a video of the suspected killer , who left the scene by bus			0
on the video , a man wearing a black jacket over a dark t - shirt gets off the bus , goes into a store , and emerges to smoke a cigarette as he ambles away			2

danger : @entity7 was pushed off the platform at the @entity69 and @entity71 167th street station in @entity22 mystery : there was no indication that @entity7 knew the man or had an altercation with him before he was pushed , police said ' all of my passengers were crying with me			1
