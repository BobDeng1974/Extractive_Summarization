by @entity0 @entity2 bugs from @entity3 could soon hitch a ride into space , arrive on the red planet and trick scientists into thinking they are @entity8			2
this is according to @entity11 researcher , dr @entity10 , who has expressed serious concern that microbes may beat humans in the race to colonise @entity16			1
dr @entity10 highlights recent research that shows some bugs are more resilient than first thought and could use protective mechanisms to survive deep space flights			1
in a simulated @entity16 environment some spores in the study were able to survive at 1.5 years - and some had become even hardier than when they arrived			1
pictured is a close up of of @entity30 spores on aluminum before ( left ) and after ( right ) exposure to space conditions currently , spacecraft landing on @entity16 or other planets where life might exist must meet requirements for a maximum allowable level of microbial life			1
these acceptable levels were based on studies of how various life forms survive exposure to the challenges associated with space travel			2
‘ if you are able to reduce the numbers to acceptable levels , a proxy for cleanliness , the assumption is that the life forms will not survive under harsh space conditions , ’ dr @entity10 said			1
however , spores of @entity30 have shown high resistance to techniques used to clean spacecraft , such as ultraviolet radiation and peroxide treatment			1
bacillus pumilus is a a rod - shaped bacteria that , on @entity3 , resides in soils and the root area of some plants			1
in one study , @entity64 pumilus @entity67 spores were exposed for 18 months on the @entity68 ( @entity68 )			2
pictured is the @entity68 attached to the @entity70 module of the @entity71 during orbital flight @entity11 chiefs have said that sending a manned mission to @entity16 is ' necessary if the human race is to survive '			1
but the huge amounts of chemical rocket fuel needed to complete such a mission would require deep pockets – the launch costs alone would be more than $ 12 billion ( £ 7 billion )			0
added to this is the time it takes			0
the space agency estimates that a round - trip human expedition to @entity16 would take more than four years using current technology			2
rocket - powered fusion , however , could one day allow 30 - and 90 - day expeditions to @entity16 by making the trip more practical and less costly , experts claim			2
scientists envision using a nuclear reactor to heat hydrogen to very high temperatures , which will then expand through a spacecraft ’s nozzle to generate thrust			0
recent advances in manipulating nuclear fusion could means that astronauts are now a step closer to our nearest planetary neighbour			0
when researchers exposed this hardy organism to a simulated @entity16 environment that kills standard spores in 30 seconds , it survived 30 minutes			1
for another study , @entity64 pumilus @entity67 spores were exposed for 18 months on the @entity68 ( @entity68 )			0
‘ after testing exposure to the simulated @entity16 environment , we wanted to see what would happen in real space and @entity68 gave us the chance , ’ dr @entity10 said			1
‘ to our surprise , some of the spores survived for 18 months			0
’ these surviving spores had higher concentrations of proteins associated with uv radiation resistance and , in fact , showed elevated uv resistance when re-exposed on @entity3			0
the findings could provide an insight into how super bugs are able to survive in extremely hostile regions on @entity3 and how these microbes are affected by radiation			0
in another investigation , other spore - forming bacteria @entity64 subtilis were dried on pieces of spacecraft - quality aluminum and subjected for 1.5 years to the vacuum of space , cosmic and extra-terrestrial solar radiation and temperature fluctuations			0
most of the organisms exposed to solar uv radiation in space and in the @entity16 spectrum were killed , but when uv rays were filtered out and samples were kept in the dark , about 50 per cent or more of those subjected to other space - and @entity16 - like conditions survived			1
after the study , @entity64 pumilus bacteria spores had higher concentrations of proteins associated with uv radiation resistance and , in fact , showed elevated uv resistance when re-exposed on @entity3 a third study placed rock - colonising cellular organisms in the @entity68 facility for 1.5 years , further testing a theory of how organisms might move from one planet to another , known as lithopanspermia			1
in this scenario , rocks ejected from a planet by impact with , say , a meteor , carried organisms on their surface through space and then landed on another planet , bringing that life with them			0
for this investigation , researchers selected organisms especially adapted to cope with the environmental extremes of their natural habitats on @entity3 , and found that some are also able to survive in the even more hostile environment of outer space			2
the findings will also help prevent scientists from incorrectly identifying an organism that hitchhiked on the exploring spacecraft as a native of the planet , when in fact it was an invader			0

dr @entity10 says bugs are more resilient than first thought
spores of bacillus pumilus have shown high resistance to techniques used to clean spacecraft , such as ultraviolet radiation and peroxide treatment
when researchers exposed this hardy organism to a simulated @entity16 environment that kills standard spores in 30 seconds , it survived 30 mins
two other studies have shown that bugs could survive deep space flight
