talk about your peaking too early			1
normally fans know that these major events are a marathon , not a sprint			1
and if we did ever forget , then the @entity5 comes along every four years to remind us			2
with a major football tournament , there is often the sense you can still squeeze in a bit of real life early on , before you formally retire to the settee for the foreseeable future			2
then @entity15 goes and flops to the floor for a crucial penalty in super slowmo			2
and @entity19 is neither a bird , nor a plane as he is captured by multi cameras gliding through the air for his headed version of the @entity27 volley			2
cut to saturday night , and in the words of a @entity46 classic other than the @entity48 ’s theme tune ‘ @entity49 ’ , our nation had caught ‘ jungle fever ’			2
even before we went across to @entity52 and the boys in @entity54 , other @entity48 folk were already at it			1
‘ high pressure will dominate ’ weatherman @entity57 told us prophetically on the forecast			2
flying through the air : @entity19 scored one of the best goals of the tournament while the lady on continuity duties - presumably wrapped in the flag of @entity67 in her voice over booth - exclaimed ‘ let ’s do this ’			1
and - because i ’m guessing he missed the old ‘ barber window ’ before he left - even @entity52 ’s hair looked excited ! when we joined him in the @entity48 studio , he was doing a reasonable impression of a @entity79 @entity80			1
so much so in fact , that when he told us there was ‘ a late injury to @entity84 ’ , you could n’t help thinking , do you mean your one , @entity52 ? perhaps not surprisingly , the only person who appeared to be remaining super cool under pressure was , mais oui , @entity28			1
in the hotset : @entity52 anchors the @entity48 's coverage from @entity54 the experts : the @entity48 had @entity28 , @entity91 and @entity92 in the studio while all around him were in shirtsleeves and starting to glow somewhat with expectation , monsieur @entity94 was suaveness itself			1
and as if to emphasize the point , he was also sporting what might possibly be the only cardigan in the whole of @entity103			2
the laconic @entity104 is already proving the perfect foil in a finely balanced pundit line up			2
@entity91 is looking very much at home , to me			1
he seems to really be relishing the rapport that he and @entity52 have been building on @entity110			1
and already in @entity54 , we ’re beginning to feel the benefit			2
‘ this is @entity114 ’s biggest game for @entity38			0
he has to perform ’ he insisted			0
it was a decisive , bold point , and deliberately made			0
missed opportunity : @entity114 did not have his best night in an @entity38 shirt then there ’s @entity92 ; in @entity33 to continue his burgeoning tv apprenticeship			0
and as the current @entity122 pro in the line - up , he played his role with style			0
‘ you ’ve got to kick him ’ was his verdict for handling @entity129			0
which may have sounded rather agricultural , but was part of an astute answer that gave us first hand insight into a man we were about to see in the middle of the action			0
not quite with his finger on the pulse was a man who , at times , sounded like someone perhaps ought to check his ? whereas commentator @entity145 sounded like he was in the heart of the action , his co-commentator @entity144 felt as if he was phoning his work in from his front room			1
while the missus was upstairs trying to get some sleep ! watching on : @entity152 and @entity153 look on as @entity38 go behind and it was n’t so much what he said , it was just the thoroughly flat lined manner in which he said it			0
brother @entity52 has hit the ground running as a tv pundit			1
but @entity144 is going to need some serious producing between now and his next game if he is going to even begin to match his sibling at this tournament			1
of course at times , only downbeat will do			0
and this was the case when @entity145 sighed ‘ the anguish of @entity152 and @entity153 ’ over what could well end up being the enduring tv image of this game			0
that of @entity170 and @entity153 simultaneously placing their heads in their hands			0
it was a moment of despair that was reflected on the return to the studio			0
@entity91 in particular was ticking there , having earlier called on @entity114 to bring his a game			1
backlash : @entity144 has been criticised for his co-commentary by fans and celebrities on @entity184 he made it clear he did n’t think he had delivered			1
to which @entity54 put up a boisterous defence of his former team mate			0
‘ he ’s got to score there , @entity54 ’ he said rather tersely			0
causing @entity92 to further defend his old pal			0
even @entity28 got involved by pointing out that @entity114 had ‘ done everything but score ’			1
but @entity91 was not letting it go			1
‘ the most important thing ’ , he responded unequivocally			0
well , it was hot , and we had lost			0
but at least it was honest and passionate			0
and our @entity104 friend did manage to lighten the mood a little towards the end when he said of @entity204 ’s late free kick , ‘ he ’s that good he meant to hit the crossbar ’			1
that got a chuckle from a studio that already feels like you ca n’t wait to get back to @entity211 let ’s just hope that @entity144 has also embraced some of that spirit the next time we hear from him .			1

@entity217 gets off to a fast start with exciting games and great goals
@entity52 and @entity91 have a good relationship on screen but @entity28 is the star
@entity144 has work to do to match brother @entity52 in the commentary *box*
