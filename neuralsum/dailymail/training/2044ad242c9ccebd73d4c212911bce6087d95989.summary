just nine games in to the @entity2 season and @entity3 are already 16 points clear of @entity5 , and eight ahead of @entity6			1
for the trio relegated from the @entity9 in may , it is hard not to conclude that their current league positions - first , 15th and 23rd respectively - are a direct result of each club 's preparations for the 2014 - 15 campaign			0
while @entity5 were still frantically buying and selling with no apparent plan right up to the close of the transfer window last month , @entity3 had a settled and balanced squad before the first ball of the season was kicked			1
@entity6 , too , were preoccupied with transfer dealings and distracted by off - field squabbles when they should have been concentrating on their fixtures			1
@entity5 recorded their first win of the @entity2 season at @entity28 on saturday @entity29 notched the winner for @entity5 at @entity31 's it was no surprise then when @entity33 lost his job at @entity5 after their disastrous start and when @entity37 's stay in @entity38 came to an end 11 days ago			1
while all this has been going on , @entity3 have been making serene and steady progress under @entity42			1
they sit top of the table after the weekend 's fixtures			2
faced with the very real possibility of relegation in april , the @entity3 board sacked @entity52			1
they were in fact five points clear of the drop zone at the time , but with a nightmare run of fixtures coming up they made the bold move to invest in the long - term in favour of the short			0
in came @entity42 , so successful as @entity3 's youth coach and a man with close ties to the club from his playing career			1
@entity52 had achieved an 11th - placed finish the season before but a steady decline had seen the natives grow restless as transfer funds were wasted on failed foreign imports such as @entity75			0
in hiring @entity42 , chief executive @entity76 felt , even if @entity3 went down , the feel - good factor would soon be back in @entity78			1
and so it is proving , even if we are only nine games in to the season			0
@entity33 's transfer policy was highly quested at @entity5 during the close season the club sold their prized assets for top dollar ; swiftly and efficiently and with no hard feelings			1
handsome fees were brought in for @entity89 and @entity90 , among others , allowing @entity42 to concentrate on adding @entity2 experience and a sprinkling of youth from the club 's academy to an already strong squad			1
while @entity3 were not turning many heads with their pre-season work , one senses that was exactly the plan			2
contrast that to the circuses going on at @entity103 and the @entity104 this year , and it is easy to see how such a gap has already opened up between @entity3 and their relegated counterparts			2
mercifully , things finally seem to be moving in the right direction at @entity5 and @entity6 , but the moral of the story is never to underestimate the championship			1
@entity114 celebrates scoring @entity3 's third goal in a comfortable 3 - 1 win at @entity117 on saturday @entity118 is primed to take over the manager 's job at @entity6 after leaving @entity121 next week while @entity118 looks to be a shrewd appointment at @entity6 and @entity124 is steadying the ship at @entity5 , you can not afford to give your rivals a nine - game headstart at this level , no matter how much money you have to spend in january			1
the @entity130 is littered with clubs who have taken years to recover from relegation from the top flight because they did n't face up to it in time and invest in their long - term futures			2
@entity3 were one of those clubs			2
never recovering from relegation in 2005 and eventually slipping down in to @entity141 in 2009			0
perhaps that is why they have made moves to make sure the same does n't happen again			0
good week for ... @entity145			0
here 's a stat for you : @entity145 are the only side in the top half of the championship not to have played in the @entity9 before			2
more importantly , saturday 's 2 - 0 win over @entity152 at @entity153 has lifted @entity156 's @entity155 nine points clear of the relegation zone			0
keep up this form , and soon they may be able to start dreaming of the play - offs			0
bad week for ... @entity161			0
returning for a second spell at @entity164 after he guided the club to the top flight in 1997 , @entity162 thought he had assembled a @entity161 squad capable of returning to the @entity2 at the first attempt this season			1
already though , he appears on borrowed time after saturday 's 3 - 0 home defeat by @entity171			0
the @entity172 are in the @entity141 relegation zone			0
@entity174 ( centre ) celebrates after scoring the opening goal during @entity145 's win against @entity152 after a poor start to the season , @entity178 are well and truly up and running following three successive victories , the latest coming against @entity182 , who led the @entity185 table before their 2 - 1 defeat on saturday			0
over half of @entity189 's squad have come through the club 's academy and perhaps the brighest prospect of them all , 19 - year - old midfielder @entity192 , showed his class by curling home a left - footed free - kick to give them the lead at @entity199 .			0

@entity42 ' @entity3 top the @entity2 table
@entity5 sacked @entity33 and brought in @entity124
@entity37 left @entity6 with @entity118 primed to take over
