a pregnant mother told by doctors aborting one of her twin girls would save the other said the seemingly impossible decision was simple - she would keep both babies			1
@entity8 and her husband @entity7 , 36 , were overjoyed to discover they were expecting twins			1
but that joy quickly turned to despair when a 10 - week scan revealed the twin girls were unlikely to both survive to full term			1
the 32 - year - old was told her unborn babies were both monoamniotic and monochorionic			1
the conditions meant the babies shared the same amniotic sac and placenta - putting them at risk of dangerous complications			1
but a 10 - week scan revealed her babies were unlikely to survive to full term the twins were found to share the same amniotic sac and placenta , putting them at risk of dangerous complications			1
their close proximity in the womb meant their umbilical cords could easily become tangled , cutting off their oxygen and food supply			0
but @entity40 and @entity41 survived , and were born in 2013 sharing the same amniotic sac and placenta means the twins ' umbilical cords become tangled , restricting the flow of oxygen and nutrients essential for growth and survival			1
specialists warned the couple , if left untreated , their baby daughters had just a 30 per cent change of surviving			1
they said aborting one of the babies could save the other			2
but the @entity57 were adamant , without needing to discuss the matter - they would keep both babies			2
and in 2013 , at 32 weeks pregnant mrs @entity8 went into labour , giving birth to two healthy girls			1
now 20 months , @entity40 and @entity41 , are healthy baby girls			1
' i look at them both now and think about what miracles they really are , ' mrs @entity8 said			2
' in the end , it was not a difficult decision			0
a 30 per cent chance of survival was good enough for me			1
' mr @entity73 , a lorry driver , and his wife already had two children , @entity77 , 12 , and nine - year - old @entity78 , when they started trying for a third baby			1
mrs @entity8 , a human resources manager , discovered she was pregnant with the twins in november 2012 , after a miscarriage six months earlier			2
' at the 10 - week scan when i was told there were two flickering heart beats , i could n't believe it , ' she recalled			1
' i started laughing with happiness			0
i was giggling so much that @entity7 had to ask me to stop as you could n't see the scan because i was moving around too much			2
' mrs @entity8 said she and her husband @entity7 , right , did not have to discuss their decision when doctors said they could terminate one baby to save the other			1
she said they both immediately refused , deciding to keep both their unborn babies despite them having just a 30 per cent chance of surviving fearing she would lose her babies , mrs @entity8 did n't tell anyone she was pregnant until she was 24 weeks along			1
the mother - of - five said : ' i was constantly worried they would get tangled up in the umbilical cord ' but at 32 weeks , mrs @entity8 went into hospital to have her babies via c - section			1
@entity40 and @entity41 , who are now 20 months old , are both happy , healthy babies but quickly , the mood changed			2
medics revealed there was no dividing membrane between the two babies - indicating it would be a high - risk pregnancy			2
weeks later the couple were told their daughters were sharing the same amniotic sac and placenta			1
@entity115 twins are identical twins that develop inside the same amniotic sac			1
they share a placenta within their mother 's uterus , but have two separate umbilical cords for nourishment			0
the condition is rare , occuring in one around one in 35,000 to one in 60,000 pregnancies			0
monoamniotic twins are at greater risk of health complications due to the close proximity of the two umbilical cords in the amniotic sac			1
it means it is easy for the babies to become entangled , or to compress each other 's cords , threatening their oxygen and food supply			0
experts are unsure as to how monoamniotic twins develop			2
identical twins develop from a single fertilised egg that splits at some point after fertilisation			0
the timing of the division determines the separateness of the placentas and amniotic sacs			0
the unborn twin girls were at risk of dangerous cord entanglement and compression			1
mrs @entity8 was offered the chance to undergo a double termination , or selective reduction which would mean aborting one twin so the other could live			1
' how could i choose between the two ? ' she said			0
' i would always look at the twin which survived and think ' i killed someone to save you			2
' @entity7 and i did n't even need to have that conversation - we were united on the decision without having to discuss it			0
' for the rest of her pregnancy mrs @entity8 was plagued with worry that the twins would not survive 32 weeks			1
she said : ' i could n't bear the idea of having to tell people i had lost the baby , so i did n't tell people i was pregnant until 24 weeks			0
' i went into hiding			0
i even worked from home			0
' i was constantly worried they would get tangled up in the umbilical cord			0
' all it would take to kill them was is if they stopped cuddling each other and pulled on the cord			0
' there was n't a day which went by where i did n't panic that they had died because i could n't feel them moving			0
' it was a very stressful pregnancy			0
i would not wish that kind of stressful experience upon anyone			0
' eventually at 32 weeks the twins , @entity193 and @entity194 , were born by c - section			1
both weighed a little over 4lbs and spent 20 days in special care			0
mrs @entity198 , also mother to @entity78 , nine , and @entity77 , 12 , and @entity199 born since the twins ' birth , said : ' when i think about the odds we were given and i hear about women who went through similar pregnancies i think i am so lucky to have both of them healthy and well ' mrs @entity8 said her twin daughters used to sleep huddled next to one another as newborns , and even now they climb into each others cots in the morning mrs @entity8 said : ' after @entity7 cut the cord on both of them he passed out immediately			1
' it was very hot in there and he had been sat down all day , as soon as he cut the second cord he hit the deck			0
' after i was wheeled into recovery i found myself in a bed opposite him - it was a dramatic end to a dramatic pregnancy			0
' the twins are now both 20 months old and very healthy			0
mrs @entity8 said : ' when they were newborns they used to sleep huddled up next to each other like they did in the womb			2
' even now they are in separate beds they will climb into each others cots in the morning			0
' i have a picture of the tangled placenta and cord - it is a big jumbled up knot			2
' i look at it and think how on @entity236 did any blood flow get through that ? ' when i think about the odds we were given and i hear about women who went through similar pregnancies i think i am so lucky to have both of them healthy and well			0
' mrs @entity8 recently gave birth to another baby boy called @entity199			2
she said : ' it was a doddle giving birth to him in comparison to the twins			0
