by @entity0 @entity1 : 19:39 est , 15 december 2013 @entity2 : 06:14 est , 23 december 2013 humiliated : a key part of the evidence given by £ 332,900 - a - year human resources director @entity5 was shown to be false the @entity7 ’s leadership system is ‘ broken ’ , a damning report into the severance payoff scandal has concluded			1
publishing the findings of a five - month inquiry into the fiasco , the commons public accounts committee said it had found ‘ a failure at the most senior levels of the @entity7 ’			1
the committee ’s chairman , @entity16 , said she had uncovered ‘ a culture of cronyism that allowed for the liberal use of licence fee payers ’ money ’			1
mps raised fears that some @entity7 figures may have lied to @entity26 over the debacle – in which £ 369million was handed to departing staff over eight years			1
earlier this year , eight senior corporation figures – including its chairman and director general – were subjected to intense cross-examination as two parliamentary hearings sought to uncover the full extent of the payoffs			2
but in today ’s report , mps said they feared some – including its £ 332,900 - a - year human resources director @entity5 – may have deliberately misled the inquiry			1
miss @entity5 was humiliated in september when a key part of her evidence was shown to be false			0
she had originally claimed to have no knowledge of an email about a £ 1million payment to former deputy director general @entity49 , but later admitted she had in fact been one of its key authors			0
the report said of her evidence : ‘ we remain very concerned about the veracity of other parts of the oral evidence we heard			0
misleading a select committee constitutes contempt of @entity26			2
’ in the three years to december 2012 , the @entity7 handed £ 25million to 150 departing senior managers			1
in an internal email discovered by the pac , miss @entity5 referred to such payments as ‘ sweetners ’ [ sic ]			0
evidence : miss @entity5 had originally claimed to have no knowledge of an email about a £ 1million payment to former deputy director general @entity49 , but later admitted she had in fact been one of its key authors asked to investigate the scandal , the @entity72 found 22 of the 150 payments exceeded contractual limits , at a cost of £ 1.4million			2
in his evidence to the committee , former director general @entity77 sought to justify a decision to hand mr @entity49 £ 300,000 more than he was contractually owed by saying that he wanted to keep mr @entity49 , a close friend , ‘ fully focused ’ until his departure			0
but the pac said such excessive payments were ‘ unacceptable ’ and identified a ‘ prevailing culture in which cronyism was a factor that allowed for the liberal use of other people ’s money ’			0
the committee also attacked the @entity91 ’s governing body , the @entity90 , for failing to crack down on the scandal			0
it said : ‘ our examination of severance payments exposed a dysfunctional relationship between the @entity7 executive and the @entity90 that casts doubt on the effectiveness of the @entity7 ’s governance model ... at present the governance model is broken			0
’ a @entity7 spokesman said director general @entity104 has now capped the payments at £ 150,000			2
the @entity90 said : ‘ we greatly regret that licence fee payers were let down by this episode			1
they are entitled to expect that their money is spent wisely			0
’ mr @entity77 said : ‘ there is absolutely no evidence of any wrongdoing by anyone at the @entity7 in relation to these payments			0
’ the @entity7 spokesman added : ‘ @entity5 made it clear to the committee that she did not attempt to mislead them and while not immediately recognising a document that was being referred to , she clarified her position as soon as @entity26 returned			1
’ unimpressed : the committee 's chairman , @entity16 , said she had uncovered ' a culture of cronyism that allowed for the liberal use of licence fee payers ' money '			1

commons committee finds ' failure at the most senior levels of @entity7 '
@entity16 *criticises* ' liberal use of licence fee payers ' money '
