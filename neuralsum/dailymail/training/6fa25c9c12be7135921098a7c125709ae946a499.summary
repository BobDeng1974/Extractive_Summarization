by @entity0 published : 07:53 est , 21 january 2013 updated : 10:56 est , 21 january 2013 what do you look for in a holiday ? a bit of sun ? some nice food ? perhaps the chance to enjoy some high - octane water sports ? well , what about a holiday that promises to turn back the clock – to help your wrinkles soften , your skin brighten and make you look years younger by the time your return to @entity15 ? welcome to the latest thing to hit the travel world : the anti-ageing holiday			1
a break with a difference : @entity0 traded chocolate and alcohol for vegetable soup in @entity24 forget ' starvation vacations ' or yoga holidays – this holiday promises to make you look younger and i , for one , am in desperate need			1
you see last year was a slog			1
for whatever reason life did n’t seem to go my way and after 12 months of no holiday , non-stop work and some minor home dramas , i woke up one day feeling - and looking - about 10 years older			1
it was as if i ’d hit some sort of tipping point , my face looked older over night			1
the wrinkles deepened , the shadows under my eyes got darker , and i appeared to have a permanent frown on my face			2
for the first time in my life i started to throw money at all sorts of anti-ageing serums and potions but i could n’t see any difference			2
if anything , they made me spotty			2
and so i did what any sane woman would , i ran away			2
the @entity58 is a famously strict spa - cum - medical centre in @entity24 , which has earned a cult - like following from celebs who swear by it to lose weight , fast			1
its no frills regime of @entity66 ( to clear out the system ) , vegetable soup and spelt bread might not be fun but it ’s certainly effective			1
royal approval : @entity71 of @entity72 , pictured her with her daughters , @entity74 and @entity75 , is a big fan of the @entity58 clinic but the doctors who run the clinic claim this spartan diet does more than drop the pounds , it also drops years			1
most of what we eat in day - to - day life – or at least most of what i eat – is prematurely ageing us			2
sugar – one of the mainstays of my diet – is the very worst			2
it makes collagen and elastin in the body become more rigid which makes skin lose that bouncy , youthful appearance			1
in fact , last year research found there is a direct link between how much sugar you eat and how old you look , with scientists saying that the damaged caused by sugar really start showing at the age of 35			2
as for alcohol , caffeine and fast foods – well , they ’re creating damaging free - radicals , which are extremely ageing , both in terms of your appearance and to the health of your body			1
by removing these from our diet you can see dramatic results			2
but it ’s not just what we eat but how and when we eat that can age us , according to the clinic ’s director , dr @entity125 , who in on a one - man mission to teach us all to chew			1
at the clinic every itty bitty mouthful of bread you put into your mouth has to be chewed 40 times because the doctors believe that if we do n’t chew food thoroughly our bodies can not absorb the nutrients properly and gulping food down puts our system under huge stress			1
@entity140 : her new regime included plenty of @entity66 and pint - sized meals finally , at the @entity146 calories are dramatically restricted to give your digestive system a break – i ’m on about 700 calories a day			1
it might sound drastic but many experts now believe that fasting is the key to looking and feeling younger			2
a ground breaking @entity158 documentary which aired last year , showed convincing proof that eating as little as 500 calories two days of the week , can reduce your chance of cancer , heart disease , diabetes – all of the health problems associated with an ageing body			1
but boy it ’s hard			2
while holidays begin with a spot of sunbathing and dozing , mine involves lying in my pants while my tummy gets poked and prodded by a stranger – a daily abdominal massage to help digestion			1
next comes a battery of tests to assess everything from my hormone to levels of vitamins and minerals			2
the tests confirm i am very deficient in the sunshine vitamin d ( very common in colder countries ) which affects energy levels and immune system and that my body has problems making serotonin			1
' do you find your mood goes up and down ? ' asks my doctor			2
yes ! soothing : @entity195 trips to the @entity58 's sauna and regular massages helped @entity0 get glowy skin lighter life : it might not be for everyone , but @entity24 's @entity58 clinic gets real results but worst of all , my levels of free - radicals are much higher than average			1
i ask my doctor why and he says it ’s a combination of stress , modern polluted life , my diet … the list goes on			2
in order to look and feel younger i need to get these down – which dr @entity125 says can be done in about three to four weeks of very healthy eating – lots of veg , no caffeine , alcohol or sugar , and no eating late at night			1
my first day of vegetable soup , sheep ’s yoghurt and bread is n’t as bad as i ’d thought it would be			1
the novelty of counting my chewing keeps me distracted and i have enough food still in my system to keep going ( i had , of course , eaten double in the run up to the holiday , in preparation )			0
by day two , however , i am so hungry i start searching the bottom of my handbag for any old bit of chocolate or mint i can find – ( i find two almonds and am overjoyed )			0
by day three the withdrawal of sugar and caffeine makes me feel light - headed and spaced out			0
the daily @entity244 cocktail we have to drink every morning make me run to the toilet more in a day than i usually would in a week			1
the regular abdominal massages only make the problem worse			0
by day four i feel like i ’ve been hit by a truck – my body does n’t know what has hit it			1
i start to get desperate for any form of sugar			0
eating my lunch of watercress soup with a teaspoon , i feel ready to crack			1
by day five , i do crack			0
i know that just outside the clinic gates there is a souvenir shop which i ’m convinced must sell chocolate			0
looking good : the end result , says @entity0 , was well worth all the vegetable soup after lots of pacing my room i decide i ’m going to go for it			1
i sneak into the shop and , like a robber casing the joint , i look around for any form sugar			0
i pick up a bounty bar - practically fruit ! - and walk to the counter			0
my heart is racing as i reach into my pocket to pay – but i ca n’t find the tenner i ’d put in there			0
i look in my other pocket			0
my money must have fallen out on the walk			0
i walk away and go back to a dinner of clear broth eaten with a teaspoon			0
but then the next day something magical happens – i wake up on day six and i feel good			0
i look at the mirror and bright , sparkly eyes stare back at me			0
i notice my skin , which is usually flaky , red and slightly spotty looks smooth , and plump and glowing			0
just as i seemed to age overnight in @entity291 , the years seemed to fall off me overnight at @entity58			1
it sounds over the top i know , but it was true			0
another guest , a woman i ’d shared a taxi with from the airport , even comments			0
' you look completely different , ' she says			0
' honestly , you look about ten years younger			1
' she was exaggerating of course , but who cares ? i become a convert			0
by the time i leave , on day seven , i vow never to eat another chocolate bar and to eat every bit of food not just forty times but one hundred times ! my body will be a temple ! i will turn back the hands of time ! it has n’t lasted of course			1
two weeks after returning , the odd bar of chocolate has crept back in , and a life without wine is n’t one that i could ever envisage			0
but friends are still commenting on how well i look			0
one colleague , who spends hundreds in the quest to turn back the clock with the help of various potions and the odd bit of @entity328 even asked what i ’ve had done			0
when i told her nothing , she did n’t believe me			0
' you must be doing something different , ' she said			0
' yes , i ’m chewing			0
' now that ’s a cheaper alternative to a fancy new anti-ageing cream .			0
