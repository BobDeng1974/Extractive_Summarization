by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 03:52 est , 4 september 2012 updated : 07:06 est , 4 september 2012 defeated : deputy prime minister @entity2 said he would never accept a peerage in an unreformed @entity4 @entity2 said he will never sit in the @entity4 as he was mocked by other @entity5 over a reform cave - in			1
the deputy prime minister told political opponents he would never accept a peerage in an unreformed @entity4 , in a humiliating cave - in			1
his admission came as he told the @entity11 about the government 's withdrawal of its @entity4 reform plans , which was met with mocking jeers from @entity17 members			1
he was asked by @entity18 if , for all his talk of wanting democracy in the @entity21 , he would accept the title ‘ @entity24 ’ - a question he has dodged when previously asked			2
however , this time he replied : ' no , i will not			0
i do n’t think i ’d be very welcome , in the first place			0
i personally will not take up a place in an unreformed @entity4			1
’ while mr @entity2 's admission was mocked by @entity17 members , the current system favours the party considerably			2
the reform cave - in allows @entity17 to keep an @entity21 filled with former comrades			0
plans to make constituency boundaries fairer have also been dumped , meaning the number of mps will not be reduced			2
@entity2 said that he hoped his plans to reform the @entity4 could be revived in the next parliament as he formally confirmed the proposals had been abandoned by the current government			1
the deputy prime minister has led calls for a mainly - elected second chamber , but was forced to concede defeat last month when faced with entrenched opposition from @entity47 mps and @entity17 's refusal to back a crucial timetable for the @entity50			1
scroll down to see @entity2 face the @entity11 little progress : mr @entity2 confirmed the @entity52 had been withdrawn but said he hoped the process had ' inched us forward ' towards his goal of a reformed lords as mps returned to @entity58 following the summer recess , mr @entity2 confirmed the @entity52 had been withdrawn but said he hoped the process had ' inched us forward ' towards his goal of a reformed @entity4 - a flagship @entity63 policy			1
speaking in the @entity64 , he allowed himself a rueful smile as he told @entity5 : ' i would like to make a statement on @entity4 reform ... or what ’s left of it			1
' the formal announcement that the @entity52 had been killed off was greeted with cheers by @entity47 backbenchers sat behind the deputy prime minister			1
' i can confirm that the government has today withdrawn that @entity52 , about which i am not as happy as members behind me are , ' mr @entity2 said			2
he continued : ' regrettably the coalition will not be able to deliver @entity78 during this @entity79			2
' but mr @entity2 said that the ' hard work ' of mps and peers on the proposals had ' inched us forward '			0
status quo : legislation to reform the @entity4 received a second reading earlier this year , but mr @entity2 was forced to admit defeat for his proposals last month the legislation was given a second reading by @entity5 earlier this year , as @entity17 backed the principle of the reforms			1
but the @entity52 's progress was halted as @entity17 sided with @entity47 rebels in refusing to back a timetable necessary to prevent it being talked out			2
prime minister @entity97 failed to reach an agreement with his backbench rebels over the reforms and mr @entity2 was forced to concede defeat			1
mr @entity2 condemned @entity17 ’s actions , but told the @entity11 : ' my hope is that we will return to this in the next parliament , emboldened by the historic second reading vote			2
' for now , the immediate decision for the government is how we fill the gap in the legislative timetable and we will bring forward measures to promote growth			0
' deputy labour leader @entity114 said she shared mr @entity2 ’s ' disappointment at the lack of progress ' in reforming the upper chamber			0
' it ca n’t be right that in the 21st century we have an unelected chamber making decisions on the law of the land , ' she added			0
pressure point : @entity97 leaves 10 @entity126 today			0
cracks in his coalition government have widened after @entity47 rebels failed to support proposals for reform of the @entity4 the fallout from mr @entity2 's humiliating defeat has widened cracks in the coalition government			1
when the deputy prime minister announced the end of the proposals last month , he claimed that the @entity47 had broken the coalition ' contract '			1
he revealed that , in retaliation , @entity63 @entity5 could no longer support changes to constituency boundaries for the 2015 general election			2
@entity97 denied the contract had been broken , and said he intends to press ahead with the boundary changes , which would reduce the size of the @entity64 from 650 to 600 seats			2
sympathy : deputy labour leader @entity114 said she shared mr @entity2 's ' disappointment at the lack of progress ' in reforming the upper chamber it is thought the changes could deliver as many as 20 extra seats to the @entity47 , by equalising the size of constituencies across the @entity157			1
ms @entity114 asked mr @entity2 whether the process of boundary changes would now be stopped in its tracks as a result of @entity63 opposition			0
' is n’t it pointless and costly to allow the @entity164 to carry on with its work for a further 14 months ? ' she asked for an early opportunity for mps to vote on the issue , promising @entity17 support for mr @entity2			0
ms @entity114 asked : ' will you turn your words of august 6 into action ? the ball is in your court , will you assure the @entity4 that at least we have a deputy prime minister who is a man not a mouse			1
' but mr @entity2 attacked @entity17 , who he blamed for the @entity180 ’s failure , giving ms @entity114 ' 10 out of 10 for spectacular insincerity '			0
' the @entity17 used to campaign against privilege and patronage , ' he said			0
' the @entity17 used to say it was the party of the people			0
' the @entity17 used to believe that the second chamber should be abolished altogether			0
' and yet when push comes to shove what did they do ? ' the deputy prime minister continued : ' they voted for the idea of reform but not for the means to deliver it			1
' they delivered lofty speeches about the need to give the people a say about how to elect the legislators in the other place , but they would n’t even tell us how many days they wanted for the timetable motion to make that lofty rhetoric a reality			0
' i think the history books will judge the @entity17 very , very unkindly indeed			0
' mr @entity2 said that , faced with the opportunity to build on the work of former ministers @entity212 and @entity213 and be the ' friends of reform ' , @entity17 instead ' turned into miserable little party point - scoring politicians instead ' .			0
