rating : we 're sitting in the gorgeous art deco - style @entity2 bar of the newly opened @entity5 hotel when @entity6 and what appears to be his daughter come through the swing doors			1
' that 's his wife , not his daughter , ' says my wife			1
no one bothers @entity6 or @entity15			1
no ghastly here - i - am - with - a - celeb selfies			2
her maj @entity19 could walk in without causing a stir			2
it 's not that sort of place			1
the @entity5 : @entity26 it was a car park - but now it is a very glamourous hideaway what we have is gilt - edged glamour , superb service , outrageously comfortable beds , terrific food , wines that start at less than £ 20 a bottle - and a doorman called @entity35 who represented @entity36 in the high jump at the @entity38			1
' i did n't make it to the final , though , ' he says , after kindly pointing out a single yellow line where we can park			2
the @entity5 used to be a car park			2
then along came @entity45 and @entity46 ( @entity47 , @entity48 ) , and now it 's a 75 - room hotel and probably the hottest ticket in town			1
the genius of the @entity5 is that you feel it 's been here for ever			1
the art of the matter : the hotel 's most expensive suite is the @entity61 - designed ' room ' it 's grand but not stuffy , with a distinctly @entity64 vibe			1
no one can walk in here and not feel better about themselves			2
indeed , about life in general			0
we are booked into a classic room , which is the cheapest , but still expensive - £ 395 with continental breakfast			0
it exudes quality , albeit of a masculine variety			0
marble and chrome bathroom , fabulous lighting with proper switches , mirrors and black and white photographs from the @entity64 and @entity81			0
one thing is missing , especially at these prices			0
but everything else soon assuages this grievance			0
the restaurant is called @entity88			1
it features a @entity91 hot dog ( £ 9.50 ) , a chicken pot pie ( £ 15.50 ) and a veal chop for a whopping £ 38			1
we order judiciously and manage to keep the bill to just over £ 100 , a bottle of wine included			0
' i could do with three nights here , ' says my wife			0
pull up a seat : the restaurant at the @entity5 does comfort food such as chicken pot pie and hot dogs me , too , ideally in a room called room , which is the suite created by artist @entity61			1
that will be £ 2,250 a night to you , sir			0
the frill - free , but impeccable , attention to detail continues at breakfast			0
my croissant is the puffiest and loveliest ever , the jam sublime			0
a young man at a nearby table looks as if he 's being interviewed for some job or other			2
he 'll get it for sure , because the @entity5 says ' yes '			0
the @entity5 @entity122 @entity123 @entity124 020 7499 1001 @entity125 doubles from £ 395 ( with continental breakfast ) rating :			1
