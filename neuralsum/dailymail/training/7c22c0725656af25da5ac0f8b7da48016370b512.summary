by @entity0 follow @ @ laura_mail a white tent next to a bowling green at the @entity3 near @entity4 , with police snipers bearing down from the rooftops of neighbouring high - rise flats , was not perhaps the most fitting welcome to @entity9 for a knight of the realm			1
but it did n’t seem to bother sir @entity13			2
‘ no - one calls me that anyway , ’ he said			2
’ he meant sir @entity16 , the former director of @entity17 and now principal of @entity19 : also known as the man who left @entity21 out of @entity19 ’s team for this year ’s @entity23			1
no wonder @entity21 ’ voice was dripping with sarcasm			1
representing : sir @entity13 will be riding for @entity26 at the @entity27 in @entity9 in practice : @entity29 during a training session at the sir @entity31 in @entity9 ‘ f * * * ing @entity35 , ’ was his opening gambit , delivered strictly tongue - in - cheek and with a cheeky smile as he took off his rockstar sunglasses to speak to the assembled press			1
he was bang on time , interesting and engaging			2
most unlike your average sportsman , in fact			2
we had , however , already been politely told that all @entity23 questions were strictly off the menu			1
@entity21 is here in @entity9 to concentrate on other things , after all			1
his primary focus has now switched back to the track : first the 4,000 metres of the team pursuit on thursday , the only event he will contest in @entity9 , and then his attempt to win his fifth olympic gold medal in @entity55 in two years ’ time			1
another @entity57 title would take his overall medal tally to eight ; one ahead of sir @entity60 , who won six golds and a silver medal during his career			2
the 34 - year - old had plenty to say about his fellow cycling knight , mind you ; primarily about the arena which bears sir @entity35 ’ name and in which @entity21 will race this week			1
‘ it is a bit odd , ’ he said			2
‘ i ’d be a bit p * * * * * off if i were him because they ’ve stuck a great big @entity76 sign over his name and it does n’t stand out that it ’s the sir @entity60 velodrome other than a little thing as you walk in			2
it ’s more like a shopping sign with an @entity76 thing on it			2
‘ i think there should be more made for him			2
stick a whopping great statue outside because it does n’t hit you straight away that it ’s his velodrome			0
i think he got done over a bit			0
‘ but he wo n’t complain because he ’s far too nice			0
so i ’ll complain for him			0
they should do something about it			0
’ ambassador : despite not competing in it , sir @entity60 is one of the faces of the @entity27 @entity101 : the legend won six @entity57 golds in his career , including two at @entity106 sir @entity107 had spoken , but there was little of the stoic elder statesman about an athlete who seemed to have rediscovered his love for the track he left six years ago to concentrate on road racing			1
he spoke of feeling refreshed and excited to be back in an environment that began when he won the three - kilometre individual pursuit at the world junior championship in 1998 and then silver in the team pursuit at the @entity27 in @entity120 later that year			1
he said : ‘ especially having not been selected for the @entity23 , the track was kind of like the perfect distraction			1
‘ the road ’s so different			0
it ’s not enjoyable the road , in some ways			0
you go there and there ’s so much pressure on you because of who you are within road cycling			0
‘ everyone ’s watching you all the time , whereas you can go into the track and have off days and no - one really sees			1
‘ i remember finding out i was n’t doing the @entity23			1
then it was like : “ monday morning i was hitting the track			1
” it was like going back 15 years : the excitement of building my bike up again and getting back on the track for the first time			1
it was really refreshing actually , just enjoyable			0
‘ i felt back in with the boys and they did n’t really care who you were			0
it was kind of like i had been away for the school holidays and come back to a new year and there new kids starting and everything			0
‘ i ’m a lot stronger than i used to be in the event , which is one of the things the road has given me			0
hopefully that will continue for the next two years			0
’ rivalry : the past two @entity23 winners sir @entity13 and @entity35 more success : @entity21 is hoping to add to his previous @entity57 triumphs , with gold at @entity106 one of his seven medals @entity9 may only be a stepping stone in @entity21 ’ bid to become the most decorated @entity167 in history , but this competition clearly means something to him			1
he has won three silver medals but never a gold , and was enthused yesteday about the competitiveness of the track cycling			1
@entity26 will face tough opposition from @entity178 and @entity179 in particular			0
‘ the @entity27 is a fantastic event in its own right , ’ said @entity21			1
‘ going up against @entity178 or @entity179 , it could be an @entity57 final or world final			0
‘ being part of it all at 18 in @entity120 was like being at the @entity57			0
i was in the @entity186 with the likes of @entity188 , @entity189 and all those types of people			0
‘ at the time it was massive			0
i guess that was the warm - up to the @entity57 two years later and that inspired me to move on			0
’ the famous sideburns may have gone , so too the yellow jersey , but @entity21 ’ star quality remains			1
@entity13 : i 'd be p * * * * * off if i was sir @entity60 ... they 've put a big sign over his name at his velodrome in @entity9 video striving for better - @entity202			0

@entity21 preparing for track return at @entity27
was left out of @entity23 in *favour* of @entity35 for @entity19
targeting more gold medals at the @entity209 in 2016
