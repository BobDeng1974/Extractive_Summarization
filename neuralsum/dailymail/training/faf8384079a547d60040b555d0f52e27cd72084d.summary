reputation on the line : former transport secretary @entity1 ( pictured ) was facing calls to quit after previously shrugging off concerns about the disastrous @entity5 franchise bidding process mr @entity13 said : ‘ officials have clearly made mistakes , but the prime responsibility lies with ministers			1
‘ when the scale of the concerns about this process became clear @entity1 should have called a halt to the process and called in the lawyers and accountants to go through it with a fine toothed comb			1
‘ i do n’t think she can escape her responsibility just because she has moved department			0
she has cost the @entity43 taxpayer at least £ 40million and damaged the government ’s credibility on infrastructure			2

’ a senior @entity45 source last night insisted that @entity50 retained full confidence in both @entity52 and the @entity54 secretary @entity53 , who actually signed off the controversial rail deal in her previous role as rail minister			1
the source added : ‘ this is an incredibly complex process and it is totally unrealistic to expect ministers to have drilled down into the computer models – at a certain level you have to have faith in the civil servants			0
’ but yesterday ’s events are a humiliating career setback for @entity52 , a favourite of the prime minister who has been fast - tracked into the @entity2			1
' heads must roll ' : @entity14 mp @entity13 ( left ) has called on @entity50 to sack @entity71 after accusing her of costing the taxpayer ' at least £ 40million ' and damaging the credibility on infrastructure miss @entity1 has long been seen as one of the government ’s rising stars			1
she was given the transport portfolio last year in the mini-reshuffle that followed the abrupt departure of former defence secretary @entity81			2
at the time , supporters stressed her background as an accountant – although her skills appear to have done her little good in dealing with the rail franchising disaster			0
chancellor @entity88 is said to have pressed for her removal because of her outspoken opposition to expansion at @entity92 , which would directly affect her constituency in @entity94 , south west @entity95			0
but , as one of the @entity2 ’s few women , she was offered another plum post at the @entity99			1

‘ i do n’t know what went on inside the @entity136 and whether the previous minister knew all the facts or not , but certainly we appreciate the fact they acknowledged that there were major faults in the system and they have stayed in the system			0
’ asked if @entity71 was ‘ incompetent ’ , he replied : ‘ i ’d rather not comment on previous ministers			0
i think it is rather unlikely that @entity1 will ever come back to the department as a minister			2
’ rail minister @entity157 denied the @entity45 had known about the flaws in the bid			0
