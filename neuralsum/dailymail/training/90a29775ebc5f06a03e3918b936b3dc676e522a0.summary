after her plight was made public , thousands of pounds were donated by @entity16 readers to help the stricken animal			0
one animal lover even donated a massive £ 500,000 gift which ensured that @entity3 will never again know want , fear or suffering			1
the anonymous donor sent the money to @entity24 wildlife charity @entity23 earlier this year after we highlighted her plight in the jungles of far off @entity27			2
now the rythmm of the jungle rocks to a new beat - digging , hammering , sawing and planing as the wooden home that will protect her and her pals is finished			2
@entity3 was snatched from her mother 16 years ago , shackled in chains , tethered on to a tiny verandah as a pet			1
she had endured seeing her mother shot and her carcass left to rot by a fisherman who wanted to keep her as a trophy pet			2
traumatised and alone , the special bonding that creatures like her need was denied her			0
instead she was an outcast , fed on raw noodles and chilli powder which left her undernourished and unhealthy			0
in the wild a diet rich in fruit and fibres would have grown limbs that would have propelled her @entity54 - like through the canopy of rainforest trees that form her natural habitat			0
as it was her arms and legs could barely support her when @entity23 officials were greenlighted by the @entity63 government to rescue her in 2009			1

help finally came for @entity3 on friday 22 october 2010 when the @entity23 rescue team swung into action			1
armed with the official licence to confiscate her and accompanied by members of the local police department who are required to be in attendance whenever a captive orangutan is seized , she was free at last			0
resting : @entity3 sleeps soundly in her hammock at the @entity99 centre in @entity27			1

there was very little time to plan or prepare			0
we knew @entity3 's owner had been trying to sell her and we were terrified of arriving to find that she had vanished – along with the chance to save her			1
thankfully she was still there and her owner handed her over without argument			0
' when the rescue team arrived it was clear that @entity3 was bewildered and frightened by all the upheaval			1
no one could find the key to unlock the heavy padlock around her neck and so she was led into the transport crate still wearing the chain			0
it was eventually removed hours later at @entity23 's rescue centre in @entity27 , @entity139			1
' you look like me : @entity3 ( right ) meets @entity142 another orphaned orangutan - it was is the first time @entity3 has met another orangutan since her mother shot dead 15 years ago swinging fun : @entity23 officials could barely hold back their tears when they saw the duo embrace for the first time @entity3 was taken first by boat down the @entity154 river – a distance of only a few short miles			1
then she travelled by road for a further four hours to @entity158 where , after her documentation had been thoroughly checked and approved by aiport officials , she was flown by plane to @entity27			0
a final short truck - ride brought her to @entity23 's rescue and rehabilitation centre where the rest of the team was waiting to greet her and settle her in to her quarantine quarters			2
on arrival at the centre , @entity3 was lightly sedated so that the cruel padlock and chain from her neck could be removed and a swift medical examination was carried out without upsetting her			2
in due course blood tests and x-rays established that she was not suffering any serious ailments or diseases			0
' @entity3 had never seen another orangutan since she lost her mother , so it took some time and patience to get her through this stage of her rehabilitation , ' said the @entity23			1
another £ 100,000 is still needed to complete the jungle home for @entity3 and her pals - @entity23 hopes that donations will spike when news of her progress spreads			1
she has been undergoing months of intensive feeding up on mangoes , figs , lychees and eggs followed			0
as she recuperated she made friends with a fellow orangutan called @entity142 , also rescued after a lifetime as a pet			0
@entity23 officials could barely hold back their tears when they saw the duo embrace for the first time , happy enough in the company of humans - the source of all their miseries - to display natural behaviour for the first time in their tragic lives			0
happy : for @entity3 , the nightmare is over - soon she will be romping on rope bridges , relaxing on tree - top high platforms and snoozing in hammocks in a safety zone where no - one can ever abuse her again now the home that will be @entity3 's until the day she dies is taking shape and - extra funds permitting - will be ready for her to move into later this year or early next			1

but for @entity3 , at least , the nightmare is over			2
soon she will be romping on rope bridges , relaxing on tree - top high platforms and snoozing in hammocks in a safety zone where no - one can ever abuse her again			0
a spokeswoman for @entity23 said ; ' what a wonderful gesture for a @entity16 reader to make			0
@entity3 clearly touched the hearts of all			2
