the chain won despite being rapped twice by the @entity65 fame : @entity72 , 83 , from @entity73 , kicked off the trend in 2011 by appearing in this tea advert the most recent @entity65 decision on december 31 came after @entity21 complained an @entity6 comparisons misled viewers by being out of date and not relevant to a ' price - sensitive market '			1
in that case , the @entity65 banned the advert despite admitting @entity6 offered savings because the chain exaggerated how many people had taken part in a brand - swap ' challenge '			1
the adverts said 84 out of 98 people saved at @entity6 compared to @entity21 , but only four of those involved had taken part over the full eight weeks stated			2

it was n't all ordinary people , though - the adverts also include former @entity143 manager @entity142 drinking @entity6 - brand cider and tipping himself back in an armchair			1
