at the inquest into his death , the coroner condemned @entity7 as ‘ dangerous in the extreme ’ and said vulnerable people who used it were at risk of harm			1
@entity35 said : ‘ i do believe that @entity7 and some of the exchange of information and communication by comment , without knowing the individual ’s reaction to the comment , is dangerous			1
‘ @entity0 was very dependent on his computer and the internet , in particular @entity7 , for social communication and enjoyment but sadly he would then be susceptible to judgment by people who never met him , did not know him and were not aware of the problems he had during his formative years			1
i see that as a very dangerous environment			2
’ earlier the inquest heard @entity0 had learning difficulties and problems with his speech and memory			1
but he attended college and had hoped to one day own a café			2
in his spare time , he enjoyed writing fantasy stories about the characters from the children ’s cartoon @entity63 on a fiction website			2

‘ i know i read the comments			2
i know i ’m a coward			0
i know i deleted the comments			2

the cartoon , about magical talking horses , found an unlikely audience among these men , who are reportedly drawn to the characters , stories , and animation style			0
though initially an ironic trend drawing humour from the concept of grown men enjoying a show aimed at young girls , the fans developed an appreciation of the critically - lauded show			0
they show their appreciation by creating internet memes , writing fan fiction , and creating music , art , and videos based on the show			1
grief : @entity0 's parents @entity95 and @entity165			1
in a statement his father said @entity0 did not have many friends and would spend all of his time on his own or on his computer a childhood picture of @entity0			1

that day , the couple were contacted by police who said that @entity0 ’s body had been found			1
it emerged that the teenager had posted a last video on may 20 called ‘ my mind is made up			0
what is done is done ’			0
he said : ‘ i know there ’s certain people , i know who you are , and yes , you can say all those things you want			0
’ police believe bullies posted more vile comments in the hours before @entity0 ’s death			1
they later examined 73 videos uploaded by the teenager , but found that most messages had probably been deleted after news spread of the tragedy			0
recording a verdict of suicide at the hearing in @entity208 , mr @entity35 said websites such as @entity7 do not take into account that those using them may be vulnerable			0
he added : ‘ they do not take account of sensitivity and the reaction of people who have received these comments			2
the evidence i have heard is that @entity0 was a sensitive young man			1
