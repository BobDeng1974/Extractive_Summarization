brook , already the @entity31 world champion stamped his credentials as a serious player in the welterweight division and will go to @entity84 next month pressing his case for fighting the winner of @entity87 and @entity88			1
but the @entity6 fight later this year is a more realistic option			1
not that @entity6 would provide such a willing target as the @entity92 - based @entity50 who went through a world of pain			1
@entity0 was defending his @entity31 world title belt for the first time since beating @entity98 in @entity99 last summer @entity0 's range - finding left set up a hurtful right and then @entity4 was put down by a sharp uppercut not only did @entity0 win every round but he inflicted deadly punishment with a right hand which could not miss. the @entity61 was packed to the tank - full , waiting to welcome the fighter @entity32 believes can be its successor to @entity64			1
that atmosphere generator had to be restarted after the electric shock of seeing another son of the @entity112 , @entity113 , brutally knocked out by his veteran @entity115 rival for the @entity31 international middleweight belt			2
the deeply experienced 40 - year - old @entity117 drew @entity118 into a clever trap midway through the third round , opening him up for the perfect right cross			1
@entity92 - based southpaw @entity4 had entered the ring a heavy underdog with a record of 34 - 3 with 18 early wins @entity126 went down like an axed tree , crashing his head against the canvas as he landed , and there were no protests as referee @entity132 instantly waves his arms over the prone body and summoned medical assistance			2

@entity4 had pronounced himself ready not only to rumble but to ignore the sound and fury of the partisan @entity32 crowd			0
@entity0 showed maturity to be patient , with 10,000 baying fans on their feet in his home town brook was dominant from the first bell and was ahead on the scorecards when the fight was stopped he started brightly enough to suggest nerves might not be problem but he promptly pressed forward , playing into @entity0 ’s preference for counter punching			1
the home boy ’s straight lefts over the @entity92 based @entity50 ’s southpaw leads were especially effective and he was off to a good start			2
there were no signs of distress from that left leg which had been savagely severed			0
this time it was @entity0 inflicting the pain			2
one sharp sent @entity4 reeling			0
the next , an uppercut , put him down			0
the third sent him to the canvas again			0
only a mix of gallantry and clinching got @entity4 through more punishment to the bell , which seemed more likely to have condemned him to a continuing world of pain rather than to have saved him			2
@entity60 stamped his credentials as a serious player in the welterweight division @entity0 was looking for the finish but @entity4 managed to weather the storm at the opening of the round – and somehow fought back			1

@entity0 's red shorts covered that wound on his left leg but there was no hiding place for his challenger			1
@entity4 was taking right hands to the head as if by habit and he went down for the third time from an accumulation of blows			0
