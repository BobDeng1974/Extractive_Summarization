by @entity0 a fantasy series it may be but @entity3 is a decidedly adult drama			1
dominated by dragons , duplicity and dastardly deeds , the world of @entity6 has gripped viewers with its tales of fueding families and illicit love affairs			0
however , for the 6.9million @entity16 viewers who tuned in to watch the show 's second season on state television , it was n't quite what they expected			1
the show is known for quite graphic love scenes between its characters but these have been largely edited out for the official @entity16 broadcast its adult themes and complex relationships form a large part of the show 's appeal but @entity16 viewers claim much of this depth is lost in the edited version a dubbed and edited version of the popular @entity36 show - with much of the violence and nudity removed - began airing last weekend , drawing ire from audiences , many who have already seen the complete version of the show through the internet			1
the first season was shown back in 2012 , with much the same editing policy , but the new broadcast still angered many viewers			0
one disgruntled @entity50 fan posted on @entity16 social networking site @entity51 : ' i estimate that they cut about twenty minutes			2
the story feels discontinuous … my first reaction was " this ca n’t be ! " then my second reaction was , " my @entity58 , what a mess "			0
' while another complained : ' so they ’ve cut about a quarter of all the fight scenes , then a quarter of the nude scenes			2
what is it ... a medieval @entity65 castle documentary ? ' fight scenes also form a major part of the fantasy epic but have again been largely edited @entity69 , the state broadcaster , also came under fire for its decision to air the show with dialogue dubbed into @entity75 - the standard @entity16 dialect			1
@entity77 reports that one viewer complained on social media that ' [ this dub ] really makes [ @entity3 ] sound like a @entity82 drama			2
i ’m boycotting all dubbed versions of @entity86 tv , @entity69 can go to hell			0
' the move follows a week of controversy for @entity16 broadcasters , which , as part of the @entity16 government 's ' cleaning the @entity93 ' initiative , have removed popular @entity86 shows - including the @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 and the practice - from video streaming sites			1
the @entity102 ' @entity101 newspaper , the regime 's official mouthpiece , justified the decision , saying it was necessary to protect the public from ' negative effects and hidden security dangers '			0
@entity69 also later announced it had bought the rights to re-air @entity95 and that a ' healthy ' edit would be broadcast in the near future			0
popular @entity86 sitcom @entity95 looks set to be the new show edited by @entity16 censors			1

the second series of @entity3 began airing in @entity116 last weekend
state broadcasters dubbed the show and edited out *sex* and fight scenes
@entity16 viewers , many who have seen the full show *online* , complain that the edited version is far worse than the *original*
the @entity95 looks to be the next show to get the same treatment
