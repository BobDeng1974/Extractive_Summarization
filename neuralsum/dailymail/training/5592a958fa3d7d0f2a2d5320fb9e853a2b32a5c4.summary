‘ what we will see is people actually spending longer in hospital , patients getting sicker and having complications and dying and it will creep up on us almost without us noticing			2
‘ this will not be the sort of contagion - like event of somebody landing from @entity36 in @entity37 with a pneumonia that we ’ve all feared			2
