@entity0 proved once again that 's she 's not your typical @entity2 talking head when she entered into a debate on working mothers this past friday			1
an argument broke out when she hosted @entity9 editor @entity8 , and fellow @entity2 host @entity10 , in response to a discussion the two men had on @entity10 ' show			1
the initial discussion centered on a recent @entity18 study finding that 40 per cent of working mothers were now the breadwinners in their family			1
' when you look at biology , look at the natural world , the roles of a male and a female in society , and other animals , the male typically is the dominant role , ' @entity8 said ' @entity45			2
' ' the female , it 's not antithesis , or it 's not competing , it 's a complementary role			0
we as people in a smart society have lost the ability to have complementary relationships in nuclear families , and it 's tearing us apart			0
' @entity0 , a working mother herself , had quite the bone to pick with that view during the heated segment			0
' what makes you dominant , and me submissive , and who died and made you scientist - in - chief ? ' @entity0 asked @entity8			1
hitting home : the debate was especially personal for @entity0 who herself juggles a full - time job with the responsibilities of being a mother of two @entity8 subsequently brings up the fact that three quarters of those surveyed in the poll agreed with his view			1
' just because you have people who agree with you does n't mean it 's not offensive , ' @entity0 said			0
@entity8 wrote a follow - up piece in response to his appearance on @entity10 ' show , which @entity0 criticized more			1
though she said she does n't describe herself as a feminist , @entity0 said she was offended by the piece nonetheless			0
' i did n't like what you wrote one bit , ' she said			0
things got especially heated when the conversation turned to @entity10 , who blamed the high divorce rate on working mothers			2
' why are you attributing that to women in the workforce ? ' @entity0 asked			2
' excuse me , let me just finish what i 'm saying if i may , oh dominant one , ' @entity10 retorted to a clearly offended @entity0			1
@entity0 turned back to @entity8 's blog post where she quoted him writing : ' the truth - kids most likely will do best in households where they have a mom at home nurturing them while dad is out bringing home the bacon			2
@entity0 goes on to name four different studies that prove the exact opposite - that children of working mothers turn out just the same as children with stay - at - home mothers			0
' i mean , why are we supposed to take your word for it ? @entity8 's science instead of all of these experts ? ' zing !			0

@entity18 study shows that 40 per cent of mothers are now leading or primary breadwinners
@entity8 and @entity10 *concerned* about role of women as *providers* , @entity0 rips apart their argument
