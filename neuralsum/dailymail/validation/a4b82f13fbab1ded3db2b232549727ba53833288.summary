this is a requirement , not a suggestion			0
he was locked out because he lied about his age , not because of the content , ' replied a @entity0 representative			0
pearson however , is not having that			0
' i would consider that complete malarkey , ' said @entity16 to @entity79 ' because in all honesty , there are many many people younger than me who have a @entity0 account			1
' ' i will not stop here , ' he added to @entity85			0
' you can not silence a voice that deserves to be heard			0
and i will continue to make as many accounts as possible			0

the video , posted last saturday on his channel , has garnered more than 1.4m views as of monday night			0
a ' public figure ' page for the student says he has ' considered himself a conservative since the mere age of 8 , supporting @entity144 in his 2008 @entity145 '			0
