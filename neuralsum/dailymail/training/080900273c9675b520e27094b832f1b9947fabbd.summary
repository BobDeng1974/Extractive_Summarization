a study found that just over 30 minutes of walking a day can cut the chances of breast cancer in over 50s older women who exercise can slash 10 per cent off their risk of breast cancer – and it ’s never too late to start , according to a study			1
it shows just over 30 minutes of walking a day can cut the chances of breast cancer in women over 50			1
importantly , researchers found the reduced risk only in women who had undertaken exercise in the last four years			0
exercising when younger , or more than four years earlier , does n’t count , according to the team from @entity14			0
they analysed data from questionnaires completed by 59,308 postmenopausal women enrolled on the @entity14 arm of an ongoing @entity21 investigation into cancer and nutrition			0
@entity24 , a researcher at the @entity25 in @entity26 , led the study which addressed when women should start regular physical activity and how long the effect lasts			0
she said : ‘ we found that recreational physical activity – even of modest intensity – seemed to have a rapid impact on breast cancer risk			1
‘ however , the decreased breast cancer risk we found associated with physical activity was attenuated when activity stopped			2
‘ as a result , postmenopausal women who exercise should be encouraged to continue and those who do not exercise should consider starting because their risk of breast cancer may decrease rapidly			2
’ in the study , researchers converted the total amount of recreational physical activity carried out by the women into a measurement called metabolic task hours ( @entity50 - h )			2
postmenopausal women who in the previous four years had undertaken 12 or more met - h of physical activity each week had a 10 per cent cut in the risk of invasive breast cancer compared with women who were less active			1
women who undertook this level of physical activity between five and nine years earlier , but were less active in the four years prior to the final data collection , did not have a lower risk for invasive breast cancer			0
the breast cancer risk - reducing effects of 12 or more met - h per week of recreational physical activity were independent of body mass index , weight gain and waist circumference			1
dr @entity24 , whose study is reported in journal @entity68 , said : ‘ twelve met - h per week corresponds to walking four hours per week or cycling or engaging in other sports two hours per week and it is consistent with the @entity75 recommendations of walking at least 30 minutes daily			0
it is unclear how activity helps but the latest thinking is that aerobic exercise could break down cancer - promoting oestrogen hormones to produce ‘ good ’ metabolite molecules that lower breast cancer risk ‘ so , our study shows that it is not necessary to engage in vigorous or very frequent activities ; even walking 30 minutes per day is beneficial			1

@entity91 , of @entity92 , said : ‘ breast cancer is most common in postmenopausal women so it is great to see evidence like this which supports the message that physical activity in this age group is beneficial			2
