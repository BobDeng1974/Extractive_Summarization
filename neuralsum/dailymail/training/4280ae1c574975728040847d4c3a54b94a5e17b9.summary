the ' @entity90 ' sign in the corner of the screen signalled that @entity26 bosses were ordering the sound to be turned off			0
an @entity26 spokesperson told @entity96 : ' @entity26 took the decision to use an audio mute during the performance			2
the @entity100 is broadcast live on @entity26 from 8pm to a wide audience			2
' we have operated a short time delay as standard practice for some years on the show , to allow us to mute language that may be inappropriate for that wide audience , and elected to do so in this case , given the performance took place shortly after the 9pm watershed			0
' however , at one point one of the rappers was heard saying the word , ‘ s * * * ’ , as well as the few times that that n - word slipped through the muting			1
light up the night : a plume of fire was repeatedly fired into the air during @entity0 's controversial performance @entity121 : @entity122 ( presented by @entity123 and @entity124 ) @entity125 : @entity126 ( presented by @entity127 ) @entity128 : @entity10 ( presented by @entity129 and @entity130 ) @entity131 : @entity132 ( presented by @entity133 ) @entity134 : @entity135 ( presented by @entity34 ) @entity136 : @entity137 ( presented by @entity138 ) @entity17 single : @entity133 ( presented by @entity140 and @entity11 ) @entity141 : @entity142 ( presented by @entity143 ) @entity17 breakthrough : @entity135 ( presented by @entity145 and @entity146 ) @entity17 @entity147 : @entity148 ( presented by @entity149 and @entity150 ) @entity17 @entity151 : @entity122 for @entity152 ( presented by @entity153 ) ferocious : while the audience at @entity77 ’s 02 arena were able to take in the full performance , viewers at home were unable to hear most of the track as @entity26 attempted to mute the explicit lyrics getting down : @entity10 soon got back into her usual award show behaviour as she was seen dancing away to the track on a slightly different beat compared to @entity34 who was stood next to her proud wife : @entity34 watched on as the rapper performed alongside the grime artists @entity167 @entity166 fresh off the runway ! visit site his autumn / winter 2015 collection has barely left the catwalk at @entity173 and its already proven a huge hit with fashionista a-listers , with @entity10 and now @entity34 both wearing designs from @entity167 ’s fall line			1
unlike many of the latest collections embracing wide - leg styles and loose - fitting dresses , celebs have proved that the bodycon and skintight fit is yet to reach a demise with @entity167 ’s form - fitting collection already impressing the stars			0
after @entity10 wowed at the @entity188 in a deep green satin gown , @entity34 thought she ’d try her hand at wearing the @entity17 designer and sport a one - piece cut out jumpsuit which clung to her famously voluptuous frame			2
reminiscent of @entity197 ’s previous collections , this stringy lace - like jumpsuit flattered @entity34 ’s hourglass figure and created a slimline silhouette – much to our surprise seeing as legging - style jumpsuits can often look unflattering			0
additionally , we ’re impressed that @entity34 is still risk - taking and shocking us when it comes to her style , and we hope the nude co-ordinates are behind her for good now she ’s worn this edgy fashion - forward one piece			0
as you ’ve probably assumed , this jumpsuit is not available to buy just yet , but you can take inspiration from @entity34 ’s red carpet style and check out our favourite black lace jumpsuits in the edit below from @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 and more			0

@entity0 reportedly kept the song so secret ahead of his performance that only his inner - circle were allowed to watch rehearsals			2
@entity11 was seen staring at the stage with a confused expression as he tried to make sense of the performance while @entity10 was spotted staring open - mouthed at the scenes before her			1
but she soon got back into her usual award show behavior as she was seen dancing away to the track on a slightly different beat compared to @entity34 who was stood next to her			0
