sir @entity1 cycling success is believed to be behind the increase in middle - age men buying bicycles you can perhaps blame cycling knight @entity1 for them clogging up the country roads every weekend			1
now @entity8 – or middle - aged men in @entity10 , to give them their full name - have pedalled into the latest edition of the online @entity13 too			1
it defines as a @entity15 as ' a middle - aged man who is a very keen road cyclist , typically one who rides an expensive bike and wears the type of clothing associated with professional cyclists '			1
the word is among 1,000 new entries added today ( thurs ) to the free online dictionary @entity25 , which is updated quarterly and prides itself on tracking new and emerging word trends			1
@entity15 has been in use since at least 2010 after research by retail analyst @entity29 suggested there had been a surge in men of a certain age taking up cycling when they might once have invested in a motorcycle or sports car			0
the phenomenon of middle aged men buying an expensive bicycle then intensified after sir @entity1 's success in the @entity42 and @entity43 in 2012			1
celebrity fans of slipping on the @entity10 and saddling up include actor and @entity47 guitarist @entity46 , 55 , who once said : ' i 'm obsessed , i 've done all the major routes of the @entity42 , including the hill climbs			0
' but while there is an amusing side to words such as @entity15 and other new entries like ' @entity56 ' , an adjective referring to eating while working at one 's desk in an office , or ' fresh - air fiend ' , meaning a person who is very keen on outdoor activities , some other new entries have been criticised because they risk encouraging children to spell common words incorrectly			2
the @entity66 said the inclusion of ' fone ' ( meaning phone ) , ' hawt ' ( a chiefly @entity71 spelling of hot ) , ' mahoosive ' ( meaning exceptionally big ) and ' tomoz ' ( an informal version of tomorrow ) could cause problems if youngsters see them and think those are the correct spellings			0
another new entry is ' duck face ' , defined as ' an exaggerated pouting expression in which the lips are thrust outwards , typically made by a person posing for a photograph '			2
yesterday ( wed ) @entity82 , editorial director for @entity13 , said : ' one of the benefits of our unique language monitoring programme is that it enables us to track in detail how @entity90 language evolves over relatively short periods of time			0
for instance , in this age of the selfie perhaps it 's no surprise that average monthly usage of the term duck face is 35 per cent higher in 2014 than it was last year			2
' now @entity8 – or middle - aged men in @entity10 , has been added as a new word in the @entity13			1
pictured sir @entity1 finance and business remains a major influence on @entity90 , with many terms from there included in the online dictionary today for the first time too			0
these include ' flash crash ' , which is @entity111 slang for an extremely rapid decline in the price of a commodity , and ' misery index ' , an informal measure of the state of an economy generated by adding together its rate of inflation and its rate of unemployment			0
new words , senses , and phrases are added to @entity25 once its editors have gathered enough independent evidence from a range of sources to be confident that they have widespread currency in @entity90 , a spokesman said .			0

@entity133 is among 1,000 new words added to the free online dictionary
it stands for middle - aged men in lycra and has been used since 2010
other new words added *inlcude* @entity56 , duck face , and mahoosive
