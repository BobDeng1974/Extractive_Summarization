taken for a ride : a café owner in @entity11 , @entity12 , was forced to shut up shop for three days after the local council put up a fairground carousel ride just inches from his shop window sandwiched in : workers had positioned the carousel - style attraction so close to the front door of @entity27 that it could not even be fully opened and even though the council apparently agreed the positioning was rather inconvenient , officials said it would be impossible to move - because it had already been set up for the event			1
mr @entity6 now has to wait until tomorrow , the end of the local @entity33 , to re-open the cafe			1
he said : ' what customer wants to sit having a coffee and look out the window at the back end of a giant fairground ride			2
it was just really inconsiderate to say the least			0
' everybody thought we were closed anyway			0
you could n't get anywhere near the shop really			0
' it was literally 3ft away from the window			2
who could ever think that was a good idea ? ' mr @entity6 , who runs the cafe with wife @entity53 , said the ' barmy ' decision forced him to close the cafe , a move which he said cost his business at least £ 1,000			1
@entity58 view : mr @entity6 could barely see out of the window after the ride was put up directly outside the cafe prettier sight : the area where mr @entity6 usually puts tables and chairs ( pictured ) for @entity68 diners was also completely taken over he claimed the ride had so badly obstructed the view that the entire premises was plunged into darkness			1
and the area where mr @entity6 usually puts tables and chairs for @entity68 diners was also completely taken over by the attraction			1
he added : ' i had no choice but to close on health and safety grounds			2
takings are down over a £ 1,000 at least			0
' my worry was if we had to evacuate a hoard of people would just have been blocked off by a ride and a lamppost			2
' the council just do n't seem to consider small local businesses here			0
it was a barmy decision			0
' baffled : @entity6 , 31 , pictured with his wife and business partner @entity53 , said he had to close the business for most of the week , a move which cost him around £ 1,000 in profit mr @entity6 was forced to close the café early on monday afternoon			1
it remained closed all day tuesday , wednesday and today			0
he is due to reopen tomorrow , once the fair has ended			0
he said : ' the ride position was just not acceptable so we left it until the council came back and had a proper look			2
' when somebody from the council came they agreed and said it 's unacceptable so i do n't know how someone could have said it was before			0
' i used to get nervous about the fair coming but because the past few years it 's been the same ride it did n't cause me any concern			2
even though @entity114 agreed the ride ( pictured in use at the fair ) had been positioned incorrectly , mr @entity6 said officials said it would be impossible to move - because it had already been set up ' in terms of compensation the council said they would just look into it			1
' we asked to see copies of the risk assessments so we knew we were n't liable if anything happened but they said they could n't provide them			0
' he added : ' we have been here for four years and it 's been the same ride every year but it 's been in a sensible place			1
regular customer @entity137 , 66 , said : ' somebody at the council needs their heads examining			0
' i could n't believe it when i turned up for my daily coffee and saw this massive ride looming over the shop			0
it just makes you wonder who makes these kind of decisions			0
' a @entity114 spokeswoman said : ' we are facilitating a solution between the showman responsible for the ride and the cafe owner			1
