an @entity1 professor set out to disprove the age old presumption that the relentless stress of @entity6 's top job makes our commander - in - chiefs age in fast - forward			2
the conclusion : president @entity12 , like most presidents , is aging no differently from the rest of us			1
' it 's just a misconception , ' @entity15 , a public health professor at the @entity16 , told the @entity19			1
in fact , technology @entity15 used to analyze the fine lines , wrinkles and age spots of @entity12 's famous face indicates the current president registers slightly younger than his 53 years			1
spot the difference ? despite a tumultuous year for the president and the infamously relentless schedule at the @entity30 , president @entity12 is aging at the same rate as the rest of us , says expert @entity15 ( president is seen at a january 2008 campaign stop at left and in december 2014 at right ) the @entity19 writes that technology like that @entity15 used is available not just to professors but to anyone with an internet connection , at @entity40			1
' it 's a reflection on us			0
it is a direct reflection of the normal process of aging that we all experience and especially that we all experience right at that phase in our life , ' the longevity expert said			1
' those of us that are in that our 50s and 60s — i 'm sorry			0
we 're all aging ; he 's just part of the crowd			2
' despite evidence of a mounting racial divide in @entity6 during his tenure , continued conflicts abroad and an uphill battle for his party here at home , @entity12 's oft - noted graying temples are typical for anyone			1
in a 2011 study , @entity15 a study showed that many @entity6 commanders in chief have actually lived longer than their peers			1
using life expectancy data for men the same age as presidents on their inauguration days , the study found that 23 of 34 presidents who died of natural causes lived several years longer than expected			0
the four former presidents still alive have already lived longer than predicted , or likely will because they 're in good health , the study said			0
passage of time : @entity86 's hair grayed markedly between 2001 ( left ) and 2008 ( right ) but at least one expert 's study says that 's just time passed stress can speed up those two outward signs of aging , and it 's possible that job stress has made some presidents appear to age quickly			1
but the study shows that does n't mean being doomed to an early grave			0
' the graying of hair and wrinkling of the skin seen in presidents while they 're in office are normal elements of human aging , ' @entity15 told the @entity108 at the time of the study			1
' we do n't actually know if they get more gray hair or more wrinkles ' than other men their age			0
' but even if they did , we do n't die of gray hair and wrinkles , ' @entity15 said			2
given that most of the 43 men who have served as president have been college - educated , wealthy and had access to the best doctors , their long lives are actually not that surprising , he said			0
the 34 presidents who died of natural causes were aged 73 on average at death , a few months less than @entity15 's ' life expectancy estimate			2
but under the accelerated aging theory , their average age of death would have been 68 , he said			2

' ( at left @entity152 is pictured in 1992 , at right he 's pictured again the year he left office two terms later in 2000 ) the 23 presidents who lived longer than @entity15 's projections died at an average age of 78 , 11 years later than under the accelerated aging theory			1
the four presidents who were assassinated — @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 — were aged 52 on average at death			0
the first eight presidents were almost 80 years old on average when they died , at a time when the average life expectancy for men was less than age 35			0
' it 's absolutely extraordinary that they lived this long , ' @entity15 said			2
that includes @entity176 , who died at 90 ; @entity177 , 85 ; and @entity178 , 83			0
ditto the last eight presidents who died — seven lived longer than expected ; @entity180 was the only one who did n't			0
he died of a heart attack at age 64 , 10 years less than his projected life expectancy and five years less than his life expectancy with accelerated aging , @entity15 said			1
among the more recent presidents , @entity186 and @entity187 both died at 93			0
@entity189 and @entity190 are both 87			0
@entity15 has even done some projecting about 50 - year - old president @entity12			1
given his age when inaugurated , @entity12 's life expectancy would be 79 , but @entity15 estimates that @entity12 will live to at least 82 because of his education , wealth and access to top - notch health care .			1

@entity16 aging expert @entity15 says that despite his infamously relentless schedule @entity12 is aging at a normal rate
