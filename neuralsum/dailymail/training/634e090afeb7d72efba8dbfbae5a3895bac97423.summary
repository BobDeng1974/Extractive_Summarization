by @entity0 published : 17:21 est , 7 july 2013 updated : 09:46 est , 8 july 2013 top gloss : @entity2 's bouncy blow - dry from @entity4 to wags , no one has gorgeous , flowing manes of hair like very rich women do			1
and they do n't get much richer than @entity10 , the perma - tanned , yacht - flitting daughter of @entity11 boss @entity12 , who recently married in a £ 7 million extravaganza in the south of @entity15 and is said to be worth £ 300 million			1
@entity16 's bouncy blow - dry puts even the @entity17 to shame			1
it speaks of luxury , pampering and - whisper it - the free time to spend in expensive salons which comes of not having to work			1
which is why her latest venture , @entity27 , a premium haircare range comprising 11 ' volumising , thickening , conditioning and finishing products for the world 's most discerning customers ' , has attracted so much attention			1
the ' indulgent and luxurious ' line is stocked only in the most exclusive department stores - @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38			1
every product is scented with a fragrance developed by @entity41 , the eminent perfume house behind iconic scents including @entity44			0
its adverts can be seen in upmarket glossy magazines this month , and promise us mortals the chance to look like multi-millionaires			0
the price tags are pretty striking too			1
the cheapest products are the dry shampoo , a texture spray and a hairspray , each of which costs £ 30 ; the most expensive is a £ 55 hair fragrance			1
in fact , were you to purchase every product - as some women are said to have been doing in @entity38 - then it would set you back £ 375			1
for that sort of money , you would hope for a wig made of @entity2 's own hair - or a shampoo and a conditioner at the very least ( both of which are conspicuously absent from the line - up )			1
the products undoubtedly look expensive , coming in metallic bottles with quilted relief designs and chunky plastic lids that - from a distance , if you squint - look like cut - glass stoppers			1
as for the fragrance - to me , it smells like burnt sugar			1
but apparently i 'm missing the point			0
according to the website , @entity83 is ' more than a luxury haircare brand , it is a lifestyle statement and a window into the often untouchable world of elite elegance '			1
i 'm not sure any window is worth this sort of cash			2
after all , you can buy a can of @entity96 dry shampoo for £ 2.99 and good old @entity98 hairspray for £ 4			0
show off : @entity2 's range of very expensive luxury haircare products so to find out if @entity2 's stuff is any better , we asked top stylist @entity104 of @entity106 's exclusive @entity105 & beauty salon to blind test £ 245 worth of show beauty products against @entity111 best - sellers at a total of £ 38.01			1
@entity104 looks after the locks of seriously groomed posh girls such as @entity115 and @entity116 , so he 's perfectly placed to judge			1
to make the test as fair as possible , we decanted all the products into clear plastic bottles or used masking tape to disguise the branding			2
here 's what @entity104 had to say : @entity123 @entity2 's @entity124 , £ 30 , harrods.com this smells terrible and it 's too sticky on the hair			1
it does give a firm hold , but also leaves a residue on the hair if you apply too much			0
not for anyone who wants a natural look with movement			0
@entity98 , £ 4 , @entity136 i liked the fresh smell of this and it gave a good hold with no residue left behind			0
it brushed through the hair nicely - a good product that i would happily work with			2
winner : @entity111 @entity146 @entity2 's @entity27 dry shampoo , £ 30 , harrods.com the cloying scent was really unpleasant , although it left no residue and still created a fresh and revived look to a style			2
@entity96 dry shampoo , £ 2.99 , @entity136 i really liked the smell , but when it came to performance i was disappointed			0
it left a white powdery residue that might be ok on blonde hair but would really show up on a brunette			0
winner : @entity2 ( as long as you can put up with the smell ) turn up the volume : @entity2 's volumising product was hard to work with @entity165 @entity2 's @entity166 , £ 30 , harrods.com this had a good foam and was not too sticky			2
i 'd be happy to use this product again			0
@entity172 , £ 2.65 , @entity136 this was a little heavy and actually gave a bit too much grip to hair making it quite difficult to blow - dry			2
this meant the hair was left feeling rather tacky			0
winner : @entity2 treatment oil @entity2 's @entity182 , £ 50 , harrods.com this leaves a lot of residue			2
be careful how much you use - it can weigh the hair down and make it look greasy			2
@entity190 , £ 11.99 , @entity136 i was n't impressed with this either			0
when you 're putting oil on the hair , a light texture is essential and neither of these scored well on that front			0
i prefer @entity198 ( £ 39.50 , feelunique.com )			0
volume @entity199 @entity2 's @entity200 , £ 40 , harrods.com this was very hard to work with - dense , sticky , tough to blow - dry and the smell was n't very appealing either			1
@entity203 , £ 5.50 , @entity136 this was also a bit too sticky on the hair - although i did like the fresh smell			2
not my favourite volumising product , but better than the other one			0
@entity210 @entity2 's @entity211 , £ 35 , harrods.com although this did thicken the hair , it made it hard to blow - dry and dragged it down			1
@entity217 , £ 5.99 , superdrug.com this was n't too sticky , blow - dried well and gave a good hold			2
i liked the smell , too			0
i would be happy to use this on my clients			0
@entity224 great : @entity2 's @entity225 was heavy and tended to make hair clumpy @entity227 @entity2 's @entity228 , £ 30 , harrods.com this was heavy and i had to be very careful how much i used to avoid clumping or matting			0
@entity234 @entity233 , 150ml , £ 4.89 , @entity136 lightweight , with a great fresh scent			0
winner : @entity111 @entity238 's verdict i 've always felt you do n't have to spend a fortune on haircare ; it 's about finding products that you like , not packaging or price			1
the basis of gorgeous , glossy hair is a great shampoo and conditioner			0
if hair 's not properly prepared , you wo n't get the best results from other products			1
i wo n't be swapping any of my usual kit for @entity16 's products - not least because i find the smell really unappealing			1
if you 're desperate to buy them , the dry shampoo and mousse are your best bets			0
i would n't use the rest .			0

the *socialite* has just released a new line of luxury haircare products
the packaging is striking - but so is the price tag
stylist @entity104 blind tests the range to see if it 's worth it
