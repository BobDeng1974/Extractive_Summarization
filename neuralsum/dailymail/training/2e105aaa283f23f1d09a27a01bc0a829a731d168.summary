it will be @entity1 ’s answer to the @entity2 : a giant statue of a naked pregnant woman holding a sword above her head			2
the monumental sculpture – which is a full ten inches higher than its 66ft @entity9 counterpart – is the brainchild of controversial artist @entity10 , who wants to erect it in a car park at @entity14 harbour			1
@entity10 , who lives in a £ 3.5 million farmhouse just outside the resort , has told local councillors they can have the statue on loan for 20 years if they grant him the necessary planning permission			1
@entity21 : @entity10 wants to erect a giant statue of a pregnant woman in a car park in @entity14 , @entity1 @entity10 ’s idea for an ‘ @entity26 ’ has already divided opinion and some residents in the town , which is a teenage pregnancy blackspot , have instead dubbed it ‘ @entity31 ’			1
but the proposal is expected to be given the go - ahead by councillors convinced it will attract hundreds of thousands of visitors			0
it would also be a boon for @entity10 ’s restaurant , 11 @entity40 , which is just 100 yards from the proposed site			1
planners will make their decision in september , and the sculpture , which currently exists in three sections , could be in place two months later			2
ill - conceived ? a mock - up of how @entity10 's planned statue would dominate @entity14 harbour councillor @entity50 said : ‘ we have got to find new ways of attracting visitors			1
' we are lucky to have an artist of @entity10 ’s stature in the area and we want to start rebranding the town in the area of the arts rather than as just a traditional resort			1
’ another councillor , @entity61 , added : ‘ it is going to make a big difference to the town and the local economy			0
in his back yard : @entity10 lives in a £ 3.5million farmhouse just outside @entity14 ' @entity10 wants to make a statement and this statue certainly does that			1
' i think it ’s a wonderful idea and i ’d be surprised if anyone opposed it			0
’ the bronze finished figure , which has a stainless - steel frame , will hold a glass - fibre sword aloft and a pair of scales behind her back and stand on a plinth of law books , staring out to sea			0
the scales and sword are similar to those carried by the @entity89 on the roof of the @entity91			0
one local source last night said 47 - year - old @entity10 had added the books at the 11th hour to ensure it would be taller than @entity95 ’s @entity2 , erected in 1998			1
@entity96 has no objection to @entity10 ’s sculpture , thought to be the latest part of his virgin mother series , on the edge of an @entity102			1
historic buildings inspector @entity103 said : ‘ this sounds like an important and thought - provoking project that would add a considerable amount of interest to @entity14			2
’ but council planners may have reckoned without public opinion			2
@entity110 , 69 - year - old social secretary of @entity111 , said : ‘ oh , please no. tell me they ’re not really going to do this			0
‘ people will come to look at it – probably to have a good laugh at our expense			0
given @entity14 ’s past problems with teenage pregnancies i ca n’t believe this is so in - your - face			2
overshadowed : the proposed statue would be 10 inches taller than @entity95 's @entity2 , erected near @entity124 in 1998 ' why could n’t we have had a fisherman or a seafarer ? ’ resident @entity128 , 63 , said : ‘ about five per cent of local people will go along with this			1
you can bet it will be called the @entity31 around here			0
' personally i quite like the statue but it ’s just too big			0
’ @entity10 was unavailable for comment last night			2
by @entity137 @entity10 , once among the most exciting of young @entity139 artists , has seen his reputation challenged			2
similarities : @entity10 's proposed work resembles @entity144 's £ 1m statue , @entity145 , erected at @entity146 critics have described this summer ’s exhibition of his still lifes as ‘ deluded ’ in its incompetence , while his @entity152 retrospective has received mixed reviews			1
some have speculated that the prices of his art in the auction room are inflated and must soon collapse			0
now he is proposing this giant piece which has the same naive awkwardness of any number of new public statues			0
it looks , in style , very much like @entity144 ’s £ 1 million statue at @entity146 of lovers embracing , probably the ugliest statue in @entity167			0
councillor @entity168 thinks locals would be ‘ delighted ’ by @entity10 ’s statue , which will certainly be impossible to ignore			1
what has encouraged this sort of misguided thinking is the @entity2 – a grand and unique image created by an artist , @entity95 , on peak form			1
all sorts of proposed rubbish has followed			0
@entity10 ’s soppy , banal and overblown statue has nothing in common with @entity95 ’s , apart from size			1
it looks like a small statue , made by an ordinarily competent worker in an uninteresting style , blown up to the size of a lighthouse			0
and i bet plans for selling reproductions to tourists are , by now , completely prepared .			0

artist submits plans for a statue 10 inches taller than @entity95 's
sculpture would be 100 yards from @entity10 's own restaurant in @entity14
plan divides opinion , with residents *labelling* it ' @entity205 '
