by @entity0 @entity1 marks @entity2 today by ' lovebombing ' @entity3 in a desperate bid to boost support for the break - up of @entity7			1
the first minister will venture over the @entity9 as far as @entity10 to make a speech claiming that a ' strong and enduring friendship ' will still endure across the @entity13 if @entity15 votes to leave the @entity7 in september			1
in a speech at @entity17 , mr @entity1 will insist that people could still live in @entity3 and work in @entity15 if there is a @entity22 vote - ignoring warnings of passport controls and separate currencies			1
first minister @entity1 is using a speech in @entity10 to claim that a ' strong and enduring friendship ' will still endure across the @entity13 if @entity15 votes to leave the @entity7 in september at the same time @entity27 uses the @entity3 patron saint 's day to urge his countrymen to embrace both @entity15 and the @entity31			1
the prime minister issued his own @entity2 message , stressing @entity3 's role in creating the enduring ' family of nations ' that is the @entity7			1
both politicians are desperate to win the battle of ' hearts ' in a referendum debate that has so far been dominated by economic claims and counter- claims			0
mr @entity1 will also unveil plans for ' economic co-operation ' with the @entity46			0
support for the @entity31 is strong in the @entity48 and many living in and around @entity10 have friends and family who can vote in the referendum			1
he will tell them : ' the ties that bind the nations of these islands will continue and flourish after @entity15 becomes independent			1
you will remain @entity15 's closest friends , as well as our closest neighbours			0
following independence , the social union between the peoples of these islands will remain			0
' people would still live in @entity65 and work in @entity10 , or live in @entity67 and work in @entity69			2
friends and family would continue to visit each other			0
we would still watch many of the same television programmes			0
@entity15 should not presume that ' free and unfettered ' access to all @entity79 services would continue if there is a @entity22 vote in the referendum , a former member of the corporation 's governing body has warned			2
@entity83 , who has served as a member of the @entity85 , claimed that if @entity15 left the @entity7 a deal would have to be done			1
otherwise , he said , digital television services might be ' cut off ' just over the @entity9 , ' so essentially there could be a removal of access for the great majority to that television '			0
the @entity93 's @entity94 on independence claims ' @entity15 viewers and listeners should continue to have access to all their current channels ' with ' no additional cost to viewers and listeners as a consequence of independence '			2
but others say that @entity15 might have to pay more			0
mr @entity83 said that while @entity15 , like @entity107 , might continue to have access to most @entity79 services : ' i think the phrase that is used is that it is on a commercial basis			2
' ' people from @entity15 and @entity3 would still celebrate personal unions - by getting married in @entity17 or perhaps by going to @entity114 instead			1
' on monday , there were gun salutes in @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 to mark the @entity120			0
' that would continue , since we would still share a monarchy with the rest of the @entity7 - just as we did for a century before the parliamentary union of 1707 , and just as 16 other @entity127 countries do now			2
' the first minister recently ridiculed the prime minister for using a speech in @entity119 to focus on @entity15 independence , even though he , too , has now decided he wants to address an @entity3 audience			1
the flag of @entity134 is flying at 10 @entity135 today , and mr @entity27 has issued his own message to mark @entity3 's national day			1
he said : ' i want us to reflect on one of @entity3 's greatest achievements : its role in the world 's greatest family of nations - the @entity7			1
in just five months , the people of @entity15 will go to the polls and decide whether they want to remain a part of this global success story			2
' so let 's prove that we can be proud of our individual nations and be committed to our union of nations because , no matter how great we are alone , we will always be better together			0
' in a key speech at @entity119 's @entity156 velodrome earlier this year , mr @entity27 said losing @entity15 would allow the light of this country - which has shone throughout the ' darkest times in human history ' - to ' go out forever '			1
but mr @entity1 is desperate to claim that a ' social union ' would still exist across the @entity13			0
last year , he insisted : ' we will not become a foreign country , that 's simply ridiculous			0
does anyone think @entity107 is a foreign country ? ' the first minister has also claimed that a separate @entity15 would abandon just one of its ' six unions ' - the ' political union ' between @entity15 and the rest of the @entity7			1
he has argued that five other unions would remain intact : the ' currency union ' ; membership of the @entity31 , a defence union through @entity175 , the @entity176 and a ' social union between the people of these isles '			2
@entity27 used his @entity2 message to issue a plea to keep the @entity31 together but last night @entity15 conservative deputy leader @entity182 said : ' people in @entity3 will certainly recognise a dragon when they see it , particularly a toothless one			1
' meanwhile , the people of @entity15 look forward to slaying the independence dragon on september 18			2
' a tirade of vile ' cybernat ' abuse was unleashed yesterday at @entity189 after a 24 - year - old quote by her was used as an argument for @entity15 independence			0
nationalist msp @entity193 retweeted a picture of the former prime minister , who died last year , accompanied by her 1990 statement : ' we @entity3 , who are a marvellous people , are really very generous to @entity15			1
' the image , which went viral on the social networking site after being posted online by pro-independence supporter @entity202 , was accompanied by a ' yes ' logo			0
twitter user @entity205 , whose profile picture includes a @entity22 logo , wrote : ' pity we never got the chance to hang her from a lamp - post			0
' other users followed suit , with @entity214 accusing @entity189 of ' raping and pillaging this country ' .			0
