‘ you should not have to say i ’m sorry if you are the wronged person , ’ she continued			0
‘ it ’s not always the fault of the other partner			0
’ @entity3 ’s controversial comments come from his book @entity49 ... and he 's @entity50			1
in the book , which was adapted by @entity52 last week , @entity3 says you should : ' commit to change			2
' have you made a full apology ? ' this is one that acknowledges your unhelpful behaviour ( eg taking him for granted ) , accepts your responsibility ( you 've been so wrapped up in the children you 've forgotten to be a wife as well as a mother ) , expresses sorrow and a determination to change , and is sincere			0
' say you 're sorry : @entity3 's believes that when a man cheats , it 's his partner who should apologise to him appearing on this morning , he maintained that a woman is not responsible for her partner ’s bad behaviour , but said : ‘ if your husband is a good man who has been behaving badly and you want to save your marriage , you need to work			1
’ ‘ you are one half of the relationship			0
’ @entity3 argued that be criticising your partner for his affair , you ’re pushing him away and giving him more reason to leave and believe he ’d been right in cheating			1
‘ but instead , as yourself “ what comes next ? ” ’ said @entity3			2
‘ what would you would have done differently ? by apologising you get his attention			0
‘ you get him to look at his half , look at what he ’s done			0
‘ @entity84 makes people angry , apologising gets people talking			0
’ @entity36 grew increasingly frustrated with @entity3 as the debate heated up			1
‘ you say men are pre-programmed to need sex , ’ she put to @entity3			2
‘ are you suggesting women are n’t ? ‘ there ’s a grain of truth is what you ’re saying but you ’ve gone too far to suggest someone should apologise for the other person ’s affair			2
