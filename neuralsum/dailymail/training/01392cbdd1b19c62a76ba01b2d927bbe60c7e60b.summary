by @entity0 published : 05:31 est , 12 july 2012 updated : 05:04 est , 13 july 2012 the @entity3 racism trial will follow his accuser @entity4 ‘ for the rest of his career ’ , a court heard yesterday			1
@entity8 , prosecuting , said it had taken courage to make a criminal allegation against a fellow footballer			0
he said @entity3 must be judged guilty if the court was satisfied he said ‘ f * * * ing black c * * * ’ as an insult , regardless of his motivation			2
a verdict is expected tomorrow the @entity31 defender , and former @entity33 captain , is accused of lashing out verbally in a @entity23 match after being goaded about an extra-marital affair with a team - mate ’s girlfriend			1
@entity3 , 31 , admits using the offending words , but claims he was simply repeating back the slur he thought @entity4 had directed at him , and denies a racially aggravated public order offence			1
making his closing speech at @entity44 magistrates ’ court , mr @entity8 said @entity4 , who plays for @entity45 , did not have the ‘ motivation or frankly the sophistication ’ to make up the allegation			1
he said the brother of @entity50 did not even believe he had been abused until he saw footage of october ’s incident on @entity53			0
‘ this case will follow him for the rest of his career			0
he made it clear he did not wish to be here , ’ added mr @entity8			0
@entity60 - @entity59 , @entity61 , defending , said there was an abundance of evidence to prove ‘ this is not a case about racism ’			0
he said @entity4 ’s evidence was inconsistent and unreliable and argued that @entity3 may have misheard the word ‘ black ’ or been confused by a shout from the crowd			1
support : former @entity31 manager @entity72 denied @entity3 was a racist in a statement read at court			1
yesterday , team mate @entity76 , right , said @entity3 should not have been brought to court over the claims mr @entity59 rejected claims that @entity3 lost his temper to goading about the alleged affair , taunts which he had faced ' hundreds of times before '			1
the barrister asked : ' can it really be right that mr @entity3 totally loses his cool , as suggested by the prosecution , in relation to a further taunt by mr @entity4 about s * * * * * * * his team mate 's missus ? ' the defence suggests that there is an inherent implausibility in that , given the evidence before this court			1
' mr @entity3 has 600 games behind him by way of professional top - level football experience , spanning 14 years			2
he has been sent off on four occasions , never in relation to his language			0
' it is inconceivable to suggest that the taunt from @entity4 , that mr @entity3 has heard hundreds of times before , and you may think he 's heard far worse in relation to his mother , made him snap in the way suggested			1
' after hearing the speeches , magistrates adjourned the hearing until tomorrow afternoon when they will deliver a verdict			1
the court heard yesterday that some fans have chanted sexual insults about @entity3 's mother			1
expert lip - readers were called in by both the prosecution and defence as part of the trial			0
however mr @entity59 said lip - reading even in controlled conditions only has an accuracy of 60 to 80 per cent			0
key moment : @entity3 and @entity45 's @entity4 clash during the @entity23 match at @entity130 @entity3 , 31 , is accused of using the racial slur on the pitch during a game on october 23 last year			1
he denies a racially aggravated public order offence , and claims that he was sarcastically repeating the slur that @entity4 mistakenly thought he had used			1
earlier , @entity33 and @entity31 team mate @entity76 said @entity3 should not have been brought to court over the claims			1
@entity76 , also 31 , told @entity139 : ' i think we should n't be sitting here			0
' he said while racism should never be tolerated , repeating what you thought someone said was ' completely different '			0
@entity76 said : ' if i repeated something that i thought you said , that 's totally different than if someone just says something			0
' the court was read a statement from former @entity31 manager @entity72 , who denied @entity3 was racist			1
@entity72 , who manages @entity154 champions @entity153 , said @entity3 had an excellent relationship with all the players regardless of ethnicity when he was @entity31 boss between june 2004 and september 2009			1
@entity3 also championed the @entity159 's anti-racism campaigns			2
@entity72 said : ' i never once witnessed any demonstration of racism or racial abuse or behaviour			0
i am certain that @entity3 is not a racist			2
' several players - including @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 - had signed copies of a prepared statement that said : ' i have never heard @entity3 use any form of racist language and have never heard any suggestion that he may have done so			2
' earlier , @entity76 told the court that on the day of the match at @entity130 , he saw @entity4 make a fist gesture to imply sex and could see him saying something			0
he said : ' i ca n't make out - him either saying @entity180 ( @entity76 made the fist gesture ) or black			0
' this has been taken as a taunt about @entity3 's alleged affair with @entity186 ' ex-girlfriend			2
@entity76 did not hear @entity3 say anything in reply to the goading , he said			0
after the match , @entity76 was present when @entity3 asked @entity4 what had happened			1
' i think @entity3 said , " did you think i called you a black c * * * , did you think i was being racist ? ' "			2
then i said , " did you think @entity3 was being racist ? "			2
@entity4 said , " no , no "			0
