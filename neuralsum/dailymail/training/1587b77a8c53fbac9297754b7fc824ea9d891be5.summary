charged : @entity0 was the world 's most wanted @entity1 for his alleged role in the @entity4			1
he is accused of beating jews with his bare hands and a dog whip the world 's number one @entity1 war crimes suspect has been arrested in @entity11			0
@entity0 , 97 , was taken into custody in the @entity14 capital earlier today			1
he is accused of helping to organise the deportation of 15,700 @entity16 to the @entity18 death camp during the @entity19			1
a spokesman for the public prosecutors office in @entity11 today said : ' @entity0 has been taken into custody			1
' he corrected an earlier statement that had said the elderly man had been charged with war crimes			0
further details are expected at a news conference later today			0
csatary - full name @entity0 - is number one on the @entity32 's wanted list			2
during the war , he was a senior police officer in @entity34 , which at that time was occupied by @entity1 ally @entity14 and is now in @entity37			1
in 1948 , a @entity39 court condemned @entity0 , who the @entity32 said was in charge of the @entity16 ghetto in @entity34 , to death in absentia			1
but he had made it to @entity45 , where he worked as an art dealer in @entity47 and @entity48 until in the 1990s he was stripped of his citizenship there and was forced to flee			0
he ended up in @entity11 where he has lived undisturbed ever since until the @entity32 alerted @entity14 authorities last year , providing it with evidence it said implicated @entity0 in war crimes			1
he was then tracked down by the @entity56 newspaper , who photographed him after confronting him at his front door			0
acting on the information provided by the @entity32 , which was supplemented by fresh evidence last week over the deportation of some 300 other @entity16 in 1941 , prosecutors began an investigation in september			2
a statement by prosecutors on monday , however , appeared to limit the chances that the old man will end up in the dock			0
accused : the 98 - year - old is alleged to have been the chief of an internment camp for 12,000 @entity16 case : @entity0 was a senior police officer at the time he is accused of committing the crimes the events ' took place 68 years ago in an area that now falls under the jurisdiction of another country - which also with regard to the related international conventions raises several investigative and legal problems			1
' @entity82 , the @entity32 's chief nazi - hunter , said on sunday that he has been ' very upset and very frustrated ' about the lack of action by @entity14 authorities			2
the fact that @entity0 lived freely in @entity14 for some 15 years and the lack of progress by prosecutors also added to worries about the direction of the @entity93 member state under right - wing prime minister @entity94			1
almost exactly a year ago , a court in @entity11 acquitted @entity14 @entity96 , 97 , of charges of ordering the execution of over 30 jews and @entity100 in the @entity100 town of @entity102 in january 1942			2
the @entity32 , which had also listed @entity96 as the most wanted @entity1 war criminal and helped bring him to court , described the verdict as an ' outrageous miscarriage of justice '			0
six weeks later @entity96 died			0
up in arms : demonstrators protest outside @entity0 's @entity11 home last year after prosecutors said investigating an aged @entity1 war criminal is problematic because the events took place so long ago the door of @entity0 's @entity11 home ( left ) on which activists have pasted ' no @entity1 ' symbols			2
slow progress by prosecutors has added to worries about the direction of @entity14 under right - wing pm @entity94 ( right ) prior to his arrest : the @entity125 stand with their hands taped together in front of @entity0 's home recent months have seen something of a public rehabilitation of controversial figures , most notably of @entity132 , @entity14 's dictator from 1920 until falling out with his erstwhile ally @entity133 in 1944			1
anti-semitic writers like @entity135 and @entity136 , a keen supporter of the brutal @entity139 regime installed in power by the @entity141 in 1944 , have also been reintroduced into the curriculum for schools			0
other incidents include the verbal assault of a 90 - year - old rabbi , @entity147 , when a stranger came up to him in the street and said ' i hate all jews ! ' the decision by the speaker of the @entity14 parliament , @entity94 ally @entity153 , to attend a ceremony in may honouring @entity136 , prompted @entity158 laureate @entity157 to return @entity14 's highest honour in disgust			2
@entity4 survivor mr @entity157 , 83 , said : ' it has become increasingly clear that @entity14 authorities are encouraging the whitewashing of tragic and criminal episodes in @entity14 's past			0
' the speaker of @entity168 's @entity167 followed this up by withdrawing an invitation to @entity171 to a ceremony this week in @entity168 paying tribute to @entity174 , a @entity175 diplomat who saved @entity16 during the war			0
hell : millions lost their lives at @entity18 , where @entity0 is accused of being complicit in deporting 15,700 to their deaths @entity0 , the former police commander of the @entity16 ghetto in @entity34 , @entity14 , is accused of complicity in transporting thousands to their deaths @entity0 is number one on the @entity32 's list of @entity1 war criminals known to be alive and at large almost seven decades after the end of the @entity19			1
