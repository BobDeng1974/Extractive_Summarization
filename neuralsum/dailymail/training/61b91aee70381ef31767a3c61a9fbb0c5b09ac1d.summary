four sls rs - 25 engines will be used to power the world 's biggest rocket into orbit			0
it is set to become the largest rocket ever built , dwarfing the rockets that took man to the moon and paving the way for manned missions to @entity11			1
@entity12 today said it is about to start testing the engines for the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) rocket - on the same stand that were used to perfect the @entity18 rockets			1
four engines , a modified version of the space shuttle main engine that powered missions into space from 1981 to 2011 , will be used on the mega-rocket			2
' this test series is a major milestone because it will be our first opportunity to operate the engine with a new controller and to test propellant inlet conditions for sls that are different than the space shuttle , ' said @entity32 , @entity33 manager			2
earlier this year @entity12 signed a $ 2.8 billion contract with @entity35 to build the giant rocket it is hoped will take us into deep space			2
' our teams have dedicated themselves to ensuring that the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) – the largest ever - will be built safely , affordably and on time , ' said @entity40 , @entity15 vice president and program manager			2
' we are passionate about @entity12 ’s mission to explore deep space			0
' it ’s a very personal mission , as well as a national mandate			0
' this milestone marks @entity12 ’s first cdr on a deep - space human exploration launch vehicle since 1961 , when the @entity50 rocket underwent a similar design review as the @entity52 sought to land an astronaut on the moon			1
scheduled for its initial test flight in 2017 , the @entity15 is designed to be flexible and evolvable to meet a variety of crew and cargo mission needs			1
the biggest rocket ever made : the @entity15 will be 384 feet tall and weigh 6.5 million pounds there will be two versions of the rocket			1
the smaller , 70 - metric - ton @entity15 will stand 321 feet tall , provide 8.4 million pounds of thrust at liftoff , weigh 5.5 million pounds and carry 154,000 pounds of payload			1
the massive 130 - metric - ton - configuration will be the most capable , powerful launch vehicle in history			2
towering a staggering 384 feet tall , it will provide 9.2 million pounds of thrust at liftoff and weigh 6.5 million pounds			1
it will be able to carry payloads weighing 286,000 pounds to orbit			2
the initial flight - test configuration will provide a 77 - ton capacity , and the final evolved two - stage configuration will provide a lift capability of more than 143 tons			2
the rocket will be used to ferry astronauts to the @entity81 , and to help us explore the outer reaches of the solar system			0
' the potential use of @entity15 for science will further enhance the synergy between scientific exploration and human exploration , ' said @entity90 , astronaut and associate administrator for science at @entity93 in @entity94			0
' @entity15 has the promise of enabling transformational science in our exploration of the solar system and cosmos			0
' currently under construction , @entity12 ’s @entity15 will be the world ’s most powerful launch vehicle			1
designed to enable human exploration missions to deep space destinations , including an asteroid and @entity11 , @entity15 is working toward a first launch in 2017			1
for that first flight test , the rocket will be able to launch 70 metric tons ( 77 tons ) of payload into low - @entity112 orbit , almost three times what the space shuttle could carry			1
from there , @entity15 will be evolved to a configuration that will be able to carry 130 metric tons ( 143 tons ) , more weight than any rocket ever has been able to carry			1
' while many people think of the space launch system in terms of human exploration , @entity15 could have a wide application in a lot of other areas , including space science , ” said @entity127 , assistant program manager for strategy and partnerships for @entity15			1
how it compares : the sls is larger than the @entity131 rockets than launched man to the @entity133			0
it will also be more powerful than any rocket in operation today			0
@entity137 's super-rocket design has yet to be unveiled			0
however construction of the first stage of @entity137 's super-rocket - capable of lifting 80 tonnes - is already underway @entity12 's previous rockets , the @entity131 , @entity141 and right , the smaller configuration of the new @entity15 ' for missions to the outer planets , for example , @entity15 could make it possible to do things that are currently impossible , such as sending larger scientific spacecraft with more instruments to far off destinations with reduced transit times			1
' agency scientific and engineering teams have been evaluating whether there would be potential benefits from launching deep space robotic spacecraft , such as the @entity157 , a proposed mission to one of @entity161 's icy moons , on the @entity15 rocket , and determined the rocket would enable the spacecraft to fly direct trajectories to our solar system ’s outer planets , rather than using planetary gravities to gain speed , reducing transit time compared to current launch vehicles			1
in the case of the @entity157 , for example , the transit time would be reduced to less than half of what it would be using other launch vehicles			0
' for as long as people have been launching rockets into space , mission designers have had to work within certain limitations – a spacecraft can only be so heavy and it has to fit within a certain width , ” @entity127 said			0
' depending on how large you make it , it can only go so fast , which in some cases limits where you can go			0
' today , if you want to send a mission to the outer planets , you have to be able to make it fit within that box			0
with @entity15 , we ’re about to make that box much larger			1

' with @entity15 , you can design a spacecraft even larger than the space shuttle that carried @entity210			1
' it ’s going to open up an entirely new way of thinking about how we plan and design planetary science missions			0
' ' the space launch system could be really game - changing for space science , ” said @entity223 manager @entity222			0
' for some missions , it makes it much easier and quicker to carry them out			0
' a @entity11 sample return mission , for example , could be flown using only one rocket instead of three			2
' but for other destinations , @entity15 lets you do things we could only dream of before – like collecting samples from the geysers of @entity131 ’s moon @entity237			0

construction of the @entity15 has already begun
rocket will be 384 feet tall and weigh 6.5 million pounds
first test flight scheduled for 2017
will be able to carry 130 tonnes into space
expected to be used to launch far larger *interplanetary* probes
could be used as part of manned @entity11 missions
