for the hero of the hour , there was to be no long night ’s sleep			1
still , if the baby girl who provided the inspiration for @entity7 ’s penalty shoot - out derring - do was always likely to interrupt @entity9 ’s slumbers , he could always seek out his usual remedy - winning coffees from his team - mates in a practice - ground spot - kick competition			1
@entity7 would probably have needed something extra strong , an intense espresso or the like , on thursday morning			1
the @entity16 team coach would n’t have hit the city limits until well after midnight following their hugely dramatic @entity19 quarter - final win over @entity20 at @entity21			1
and the @entity23 goalie may well have been feeling particularly knackered , having first excelled during regulation and extra time , before making two penalty saves - one standard , the other quite extraordinary - to send @entity16 to a @entity29 semi-final by dint of a 7 - 6 win			1
@entity16 's @entity7 saved two penalties during the @entity34 quarter - final revealing the psychology he had employed to first thwart @entity37 ’s tame effort , when conceding would have seen @entity16 dumped out of the competition , and then @entity40 ’s brilliantly - struck attempt , @entity7 - booked for his clowning around during the shoot - out - said : ‘ of course i was dancing around on the goal line , trying to put the @entity20 players off			1
you have to try something			2
‘ to be honest , i was upset with myself because , all the time , i seemed to be choosing the wrong way			2
how many penalties did i face before i saved one ? five , six , seven ? ‘ so i told myself : “ come on , i have to help my team			1
i have to do this for myself ”			2
i managed to save one			2
‘ for the last penalty , i thought about my daughter , @entity57			2
she is just five months old , my first child			2
i said : “ ok , i have to make one more save for @entity57 ”			0
she is very special to me , so i wanted to do something for her			0
‘ everything i do is for her and , hopefully , she will be able to watch a video of this in the future = and i ’ll tell her i was thinking of her when i made the last save			0
’ the @entity16 stopper helped his side to triumph 7 - 6 on penalties against @entity20 on wednesday night there were times on wednesday night when it seemed as if the identity of the fourth @entity19 semi-finalist would be left unknown into the wee small hours , so expertly were the penalties despatched by both sides			1
with player after player either thundering shots into corners or deftly disguising their intentions , it was always going to take something special from one of the goalkeepers to settle the tie			0
@entity86 , a well - travelled 31 - year - old who admits to being almost obsessive about the art of the penalty			1
‘ we practice penalties a lot - all the time , ’ he said			1
‘ we have penalty competitions to see who buys the coffees			0
it ’s a very good laugh , with a serious side , because you know it can come in handy			0
‘ last week , we actually did n’t practice			0
we were too busy with a lot of other things			0
but we do practice them a lot and i think , as a goalkeeper , it ’s very helpful			1
i have to thank the players and the staff for helping me practice			0
‘ no , i do n’t have to buy the coffees very often , actually			0
sometimes i have to – but i like to win ! i just have to thank the team , because they give me such confidence that i felt very calm when it came to the shoot - out against @entity20			1
‘ i never study opponents ’ penalties before games			1
it would n’t help much in a shoot - out , when you are facing so many			1
‘ i knew a few @entity20 players from last season but , to be honest , i did n’t expect the game to go to extra time and penalties			1
in a shoot - out , or even when practising , i think it ’s about what you feel on the line			2
how you feel the guy is going to shoot it			0
@entity7 's two saves mean that @entity16 will head to @entity29 for a @entity34 semi-final ‘ it was a very busy night even before the penalties			1
the first thing i have to say is that @entity20 played very , very well			1
both teams tried to play football and @entity20 should be very proud of how they performed			1
but i am really proud we made it into the semi-finals , of course			0
’ @entity7 admits to having a slight preference ahead of saturday ’s draw for the semis , saying : ‘ i ’ll be honest , i would like to play against @entity144 - or maybe @entity145			1
i like the big games			0
‘ but we ’ll have to play very well to beat anyone left in the draw , @entity147 are a very good team			0
we have confidence , though			0
so , if we play well , i do n’t care who we play against			0
’ while @entity7 rightly received plenty of plaudits for his performance , there is little doubt @entity20 deserved much praise for their efforts in what was a pulsating encounter			1
in fact , a great deal has changed at @entity21 in the 12 months since @entity162 sat grim - faced in the aftermath of a @entity19 quarter - final loss to @entity165 , unable * not * to listen to the angry mob gathered outside @entity21 demanding his dismissal			2
on wednesday night , @entity162 ’s successor ’s successor - @entity168 = saw his team applauded off the pitch at their home ground after exiting the same competition at the identical stage			2
what ’s changed for the better ? not the status of the club , a reluctant member of the @entity179			0
maybe it ’s more about mood			0
‘ yes , it is quite a contrast , ’ admitted midfielder @entity182			0
‘ but , ironically , that game against @entity165 was probably one of our best performances last season – we just could not score			0
‘ the fans were right to vent their anger , we lost a derby , even if it was a good performance			0
like you say , the fans were happy with our effort and performance level against @entity16 - because i do n’t think you could have asked much more from any of the players that stepped out on the pitch			1
‘ the manager has tried to install a bit of devilment in us			0
even if we do go behind in game we feel we have a way of finding a way back - we did it three times against @entity16 ! the manager is trying to get a bit of nastiness about us and that ’s been shown			1
’ if the @entity20 players may take some time to recover , mentally and physically , in time they may look back on their performance with pride			1
@entity182 revealed : ‘ one of the @entity16 players , @entity214 , said to me during the game : “ this is the most enjoyable game i ’ve played in all season ”			1
that ’s probably because it was so open , with lots of goals and chances , decisions for the referee - and obviously the penalty shoot - out at the end			2
‘ it was disappointing for us to be the losing team on penalties but it was definitely an entertaining game			2
we can agree on that			0
‘ looking at the team we have now and the way we are playing , if we had that philosophy last season then i really do not think we would be in the position we are in now			0
‘ it is easy to say that			0
but , when you are playing against a team like @entity16 and matching them - probably more than matching them actually - then it shows how far we have come in a short space of time			1
‘ we know ourselves but i think we have to prove it to people how good we can be - and do it more consistently			2
but our last two performances against the opposition we have been playing against shows what we are capable of , it just needs to be on a more consistent basis			0
