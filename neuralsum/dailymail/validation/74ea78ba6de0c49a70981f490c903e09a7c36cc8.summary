the @entity0 is reportedly considering a new power play in the @entity4 - @entity3 conflict that would paint @entity5 into a corner just days after his stunning come - from - behind victory in his country 's hotly contested elections			1
in the final days of campaigning , @entity5 vowed in an historic u-turn that his government would never agree to the creation of a @entity3 state			1
but now president @entity15 is contemplating using the @entity16 as a trump card to force the issue			0
under a plan outlined by @entity21 , the @entity19 would ease away from decades of opposition to a @entity24 resolution demanding peace talks and a final rapprochement between @entity4 and the @entity27			1
the @entity0 cautiously avoided commenting on its future plans on thursday when it was bombarded with questions by reporters on the topic , saying only that it would ' evaluate what our path is forward ' is in light of @entity5 's comments			1
not so fast ... the @entity0 is considering a @entity5 smackdown in the form on @entity16 leverage to force him into breaking a campaign promise about peace with @entity3 watching and waiting : @entity19 spokeswoman @entity41 said wednesday that the @entity42 is evaluating its options – leaving the door open for lifting opposition to a @entity16 two - state solution pushed on @entity4 the @entity42 and @entity4 leaders have a famously chilly relationship			1
a former top - level @entity15 campaign aide helped organize voters aligned with @entity5 's political opposition – even as the president refused to meet with @entity5 this month , saying he did n't want to influence the election 's outcome			1
the @entity15 administration hoped to see @entity5 's left - wing rival , @entity56 , prevail on tuesday			2
diplomats at the @entity16 privately learned in the run - up to @entity59 that the @entity42 would not press the @entity24 on peace talks if @entity56 were to win , since he would likely have carried the ball on his own			0
but with @entity5 poised to organize a coalition government comprised of right - wing and @entity66 parties opposed to a @entity3 state , all bets are off			2
@entity19 spokeswoman @entity41 told reporters on wednesday that ' we ’re currently evaluating our approach			0
we ’re not going to prejudge what we would do if there was a @entity16 action			0
' the chief spokesman for @entity0 reiterated the administration 's position on thursday and made clear that no decisions had been made yet on the @entity42 ' part			2
he also refused to characterize the president 's reaction to @entity5 's victory , stating that , obviously , the president was ' aware ' of it when asked by a reporter if @entity15 was ' disappointed ' with the election results			1
complicating the situation , the @entity27 says it might take grievances against @entity4 , stemming from last year 's brief @entity89 war , to the @entity90			2
the @entity92 ’s top diplomat in the @entity42 explained to @entity21 that the @entity27 could formally accuse @entity4 of committing war crimes when it fired rockets into populated areas in response to sustained attacks			1
@entity4 has said it did all it could to avoid casualties among civilians , but insists militants from the @entity102 terror group took shelter where collateral damage would be greatest in order to discourage return fire			0
turning to the @entity90 for redress would prove costly for @entity3 , however			0
the @entity42 provides about $ 500 million in annual aid to the @entity27 , and $ 400 million of that is drawn from an @entity110 that members of @entity112 from both sides of the political aisle have threatened to cut off			1
the @entity42 has paid out approximately $ 5 billion in aid money to the @entity27 since the 1990s , according to the nonpartisan @entity116 – representing about one in four dollars it receives from the international community			0
but at the end of january an astonishing 75 out of 100 @entity42 senators signed a letter to secretary of state @entity122 warning that any @entity3 action against @entity4 in the @entity90 would be met by a budget axe			1
the 2015 budget appropriations bill , signed by @entity15 , explicitly prohibited funding for the @entity27 if it were to initiate – or even actively support – an @entity90 probe related to war crimes accusations against @entity4			1
big chill : president @entity15 has had the frostiest relationship with @entity4 of any @entity42 leader since the 1970s the senators warned @entity122 that @entity133 was illegally challenging ' @entity4 ’s legitimate right to defend its citizens and territory			2
' @entity27 president @entity133 officially joined the @entity90 late last year			0
in the days following the seating of the new @entity112 in january – long before @entity5 notched his surprising re-election win – the @entity19 seemed to lean toward supporting the @entity139			0
@entity19 spokeswoman @entity41 told reporters then that action in the @entity90 could have unspecified ' implications ' for future @entity42 - @entity3 aid			2
' @entity112 has a great deal of power in that regard , ' she said			0
but administration officials are now leaning toward using the @entity16 to force @entity5 into a tricky spot			0
' we are signaling that if the @entity4 government ’s position is no longer to pursue a @entity3 state , we ’re going to have to broaden the spectrum of options we pursue going forward , ' a @entity42 official told @entity156			1
and @entity157 , who leads the pro-israel but left - wing group @entity160 , told the paper that he expects the @entity15 administration to look very closely at the possibility of either joining , or at least not blocking an internationally backed move at the @entity16 to restate the parameters for ending the [ @entity167 - @entity4 ] conflict			0
' @entity0 chief of staff @entity169 's remarks to the group on monday at its national conference in @entity172 could shed further light on the administration 's position			0
the @entity4 election , and the @entity15 administration 's reactions , come against the backdrop of @entity42 negotiations with @entity181 over its nuclear ambitions and @entity5 's forceful objections that a nuke in @entity185 would be an existential threat to @entity4			1
@entity122 , @entity42 's top diplomat , phoned @entity5 to congratulate him on his victory , but did so from @entity188 where he was meeting with his @entity181 counterpart			0
president @entity15 called the @entity4 leader thursday afternoon , the @entity0 said .			2

@entity15 may end @entity42 opposition to a @entity24 resolution designed to force @entity4 into a two - state solution with @entity3
@entity0 is upset that @entity5 was re-elected , especially on the u-turn promise that he would n't agree to a @entity3 state
@entity27 threatened to file war crimes charges against @entity4 in the @entity90 , related to rocket attacks last *summer*
@entity42 @entity112 would cut $ 400 million in annual aid to the @entity27 is it followed through
@entity15 's spokesman refused to characterize the president 's reaction to @entity5 's *reelection* on thursday
he would only say that the @entity4 *pm* 's comments on @entity212 had lead the president and his *advisers* to ' evaluate what our path is forward '
