@entity0 reached 12,000 test runs but bowlers were otherwise dominant on day one of the second test between @entity4 and @entity5 in @entity6			1
a total of 15 wickets fell on a green track at the @entity10 - four of them to @entity12 - as the hosts were bowled out for 221 before @entity5 slipped to 78 for five , @entity14 taking three for 23			1
@entity0 , though , stood firm on 33 not out having become the fastest player , and the first from his country , to break the 12,000 barrier			1
he is only the fifth man to achieve the feat. @entity5 's @entity0 ( left ) is clapped off by @entity4 players after reaching 12,000 test runs @entity0 became the quickest player ever to reach 12,000 @entity3 runs , and the first ever @entity23 but it was a day for the bowlers at @entity6 as 15 wickets fell on the first day of the second test @entity4 made a steady start after being put in , openers @entity27 and @entity29 putting on 31 in seven overs before the former was caught behind off @entity33			1
@entity34 was the lynchpin of the innings with 69 , adding 31 with @entity29 who then gave wicketkeeper @entity37 his second catch			0
@entity34 and @entity39 put on 79 before @entity39 ( 35 ) chopped on to become @entity12 's second victim			2
@entity41 , who before the match had been presented with the freedom of the city of @entity6 , failed to celebrate as he slashed his second ball from @entity46 on to the stumps			0
@entity4 bowler @entity48 ( right ) leapfrogs the wickets but knocks off the bails @entity34 's half - century arrived with an unconvincing edge short of first slip which bounced away to the boundary			2
it was his eighth four in 75 balls			0
but he lost further partners in @entity48 and @entity57 before becoming the seventh man out as he went in similar fashion to @entity41 and @entity39 , bowled off the inside edge			0
@entity61 became @entity12 's fourth victim and @entity14 was last man out after an enterprising last - wicket stand of 26 with @entity64			0
@entity5 opener @entity65 edged @entity67 to slip and @entity68 joined the ranks of batsmen playing on , though in unfortunate fashion as a defensive push at @entity14 came off the toe end , bounced up and looped onto the top of his stumps			2
@entity5 's @entity0 bats during day one of the second test between @entity5 and @entity4 but @entity0 tucked @entity64 through the leg side for two to reach his landmark , joining only @entity81 pair @entity80 and @entity82 , former @entity84 captain @entity83 and @entity86 all - rounder @entity85			1
the scoreless @entity87 almost immediately fended @entity14 to @entity41 at short cover and @entity89 made 15 before edging @entity61 to keeper @entity57			0
@entity37 joined @entity0 to see @entity5 through to the close , making six before falling in the final over to end the day 's play			1
@entity5 's @entity87 ( left ) , @entity93 ( centre ) and @entity65 celebrate a wicket			0

@entity4 were bowled out for 221 in first innings at @entity6
@entity5 closed on 78 for five at end of first day of second test
@entity0 reached 12,000 test runs , the first @entity23 to do so
