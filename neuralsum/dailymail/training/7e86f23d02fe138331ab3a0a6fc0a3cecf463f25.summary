@entity0 has sought to defuse a perceived rift with @entity2 by insisting he ’s got no issue with the way his @entity6 predecessor managed his players			1
the @entity8 has ordered his squad to eat lunch together at @entity11 , has imposed a ban on fizzy drinks and has ordered his players to reduce their body fat			1
such changes were perceived by some as a slight on the previous regime – with @entity2 hitting back on a radio interview over the weekend			1
@entity0 attempted to diffuse the perceived rift with his @entity22 predecessor @entity2 without specifically mentioning @entity0 by name , @entity2 stated : ‘ all you hear now is that you need to ban chips , tomato sauce , fizzy drinks			1
yeah , because that makes them better players			1
‘ it ’s disrespectful when a new manager comes in and immediately says : “ the players are n’t fit enough ”			2
’ @entity0 , however , yesterday sought to clarify his position and stressed that striving to do things differently did n’t necessarily imply a criticism of the way things were done before			1
‘ i inherited a champion team so i never said anything to make that performance bad , ’ he stated			2
@entity2 dismissed measures such as banning chips and fizzy drinks saying it did n't make players better ‘ what i meant is you get in some new players and you also have players who have been out injured , had surgeries and come back again — there is always room for improvements			1
‘ as he says as well , there are different ways to look at things and , for me , we still have a job to do to get the players fitter			2
that ’s nothing about what has gone here before because that was great , he did fantastically well and i think i have been respectful all the time			2
i ’m a big fan of what he has done before			2
’ with his side sitting fourth in the @entity67 and having won just one of their past seven matches in all competitions , @entity0 intends playing the strongest possible team against @entity72 in the @entity73 tomorrow			1
and , despite growing suggestions that @entity75 is poised to rejoin @entity76 on loan after being omitted from the squad which faced @entity79 , @entity0 reiterated his desire to hold on to the striker			1
@entity0 's side will face @entity72 at @entity6 mid-week while @entity84 will have to overcome @entity85 on interest from @entity76 , @entity0 said : ‘ i know there ’s been interest but we have n’t agreed on anything but we ’ll see what is happening			1
’ asked if he would consider allowing the player to leave , he replied : ‘ we ’ll see how it goes			0
‘ there have n’t been any real talks between the clubs			0
@entity75 is playing games here and he ’s fighting for a place in the starting 11			0
’ pressed on what the player needed to do to force his way back into his match - day squads , @entity0 replied : ‘ he needs to show himself in training , work hard every day and take his chances when he gets them , same as everybody else			1
’ however , when asked if @entity75 would be in his squad tomorrow , the manager answered : ‘ we ’ll see			0
’ @entity76 boss @entity109 yesterday branded fresh talk of a loan return for @entity75 as ‘ just speculation ’			0
but he refused to deny on - going interest in the unsettled @entity22 striker and admitted he remains on the look - out for ‘ someone who could really make a difference ’			1
@entity118 scored a second - half penalty against @entity79 to earn a point at the weekend with @entity76 ’ worrying start to the season continuing after saturday ’s 1 - 0 defeat at @entity124 , the suggestion that a third loan spell for @entity75 at @entity127 is imminent refuses to go away			0
however , speaking ahead of tonight ’s @entity73 trip to face @entity67 strugglers @entity129 , @entity109 said : ‘ i do n’t want to speak about players that are not mine			2
is that me ducking it ? no , i ca n’t comment on someone else ’s player			0
‘ obviously , there ’s speculation but , as far as i ’m aware , it ’s just speculation			0
i do n’t know where it ’s come from			0
‘ but , especially with it being my former club , it would be very disrespectful for me to speak about a player who ’s not even ours			0
@entity146 could be set for a loan move back to @entity76 after struggling for game time at @entity22 ‘ if it was someone we thought could really make a difference , then i think the board would be very supportive			1
‘ obviously , you ’ve got a player who ’s not playing and people are putting two and two together and making six			0
i want to really focus on @entity129 and not on something that ’s got nothing to do with me			0
’ saturday ’s loss was @entity76 fourth of the league campaign and leaves them a massive 10 points adrift of undefeated rivals @entity72			0
it leaves question marks hanging over the new regime being built by @entity109 under new chief executive @entity166 , but the former @entity22 and @entity168 defender insisted he had steeled himself for the pressures of management			1
‘ pressure ? i believe in what i ’m doing , ’ he said			0
‘ yes , obviously i believe the results need to keep getting better , but from a pressure point of view i believe in the players			2
and , as long as they keep seeing me believing , it will turn			0

@entity0 banned fizzy drinks for @entity22 players
@entity2 appeared to take *offence* , dismissing such measures
