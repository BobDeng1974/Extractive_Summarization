the @entity0 has announced the launch of a ' pay - to - keep ' download service which will give viewers access to older and previously unavailable shows			1
' @entity5 ' will connect the @entity0 archives to the @entity7 , allowing viewers to pay a ' relatively modest ' fee to download older classics			1
the rumoured price for a tv show is about £ 2 , which could then be kept forever on a computer hard drive			1
catch - up tv : the success of @entity15 has inspired the @entity0 to open up the archives so that long - hidden classics can be seen again the project means shows which have never seen the light of the day since their first run may finally be available to a nostalgic audience			1
many older shows , for instance from the 1980s and 1990s , retain a loyal following , but without enough demand to warrant a dvd release , there is currently no way of making them available to the public			1
@entity0 director general @entity32 announced the proposals at the @entity34 in @entity35 , and asked @entity37 producers to give their support			1
he said : ' a large proportion of what the @entity0 makes and broadcasts is never seen or heard of again			2
' the idea behind @entity5 is simple			0
it is that , for as much of our content as possible , in addition to the existing iplayer window , another download - to - own window would open soon after transmission - so that if you wanted to purchase a digital copy of a programme to own and keep , you could pay what would generally be a relatively modest charge for doing so '			0
@entity32 called the scheme the ' digital equivalent ' of buying a dvd , and suggested other streaming or web tv services might be able to buy or licence the content			0
he said : ' it 's the exact analogy of going into a high street shop to buy a dvd or , before that , a @entity65 cassette			0
in the 1960s and 1970s , most shows were broadcast once and never seen again			2
indeed tapes were often wiped or re-used , meaning a lot of material , like early @entity71 episodes , are lost forever or only exist in audio format			2
if shows were ' repeated ' , it would normally be by getting the actors to reprise their characters , as casting agencies were anxious that repeats would reduce the demand for actors			2
but as time went on , the cultural value of tv began to be recognised and the @entity0 began storing broadcasts for posterity			2
' for decades the @entity37 public has understood the distinction between watching @entity88 on @entity89 and then going out to buy a permanent copy of it			0
@entity5 is the digital equivalent of doing the second			0
' in order to tempt content providers over to @entity5 , the @entity0 will give them a little more cash - 40p per episode , compared to , for instance , the 28p offered by @entity100			1
while @entity32 said the project would provide additional funding for independent productions , he denied accusations it was a ' second licence fee by stealth '			0
internet streaming has taken off in a big way in the last few years , spearheaded by services such as @entity15			0
most operators , such as @entity112 , @entity113 , and @entity114 also offer limited streaming services for free , although it is likely that many services will try to profit from their operations over time			2
meanwhile big players in the market such as @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 's @entity100 are pushing tv and movie streaming globally , and most services are available across a wide range of distribution channels , such as on the web , on video consoles like the @entity130 , and through set - top boxes			0
@entity132 from 1963 : many early episodes of @entity71 are unavailable to the wider public , but @entity15 - style digitisation may once again offer older shows to a modern audience the @entity0 officially launched @entity15 in 2007 , and quickly became a hit			1
while @entity15 drew some criticism from some commercial content providers for offering the service for free , it has drawn a great reaction from viewers who can catch up with shows for up to a week after broadcast			0
it has also helped provide niche shows with an expanded audience , and helps the @entity0 assess get a better picture of ratings of shows			1
two of the @entity0 's biggest shows from the last few years , @entity71 and @entity153 , both spearheaded by writer @entity155 , regularly pick up millions of extra viewers via @entity15			1
criticisms of the service generally relate to the unavailability of the service overseas due to licencing issues .			0

unavailable classics will be available for a rumoured £ 1.89 an episode
shows can be downloaded and stored permanently
