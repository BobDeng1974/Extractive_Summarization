a @entity1 car collector spent four times the expected price of a 1967 @entity3 because it was once owned by the @entity5 @entity4			1
the actor bought the @entity3 275 gtb / 4 while filming police drama @entity7			1
in the film , his character @entity7 is followed in his 1967 @entity11 by a black @entity12 in one of the best car chase scenes in @entity15 history			2
@entity4 insisted during filming that he would perform most of his own stunts , including the high - speed car chase			2
from a standing start , the car would hit 60mph in 6.5 seconds before reaching a top speed of 165mph			0
@entity4 kept the car until 1971 when he sold it to fellow actor @entity27 , who appeared in @entity28 and @entity29			1
@entity37 , an @entity39 former @entity38 winner , recently bought the car and asked @entity3 to return the car to how it looked when @entity4 owned it			1
the 165mph @entity3 , regarded as one of the finest classic sports cars , went under the hammer at @entity46 ' sale in @entity47 , @entity48			1
bidding opened up at $ 4 million , before a phone bidder offered $ 6 million			1
it then went to $ 7m before increasing in increments of $ 250,000			0
at $ 8.5 million , the offer suddenly leapt to $ 9 million before the hammer went down at $ 9.25 million			0
the final price , with a premium , was $ 10.1 million ( £ 6 million ) - which is around four times what someone would have paid for the car had it not been owned by @entity61 star			1
the 275 @entity62 / 4 was one of the best looking @entity3 's ever made and was designed as a @entity63 , capable of being driven thousands of miles in speed and luxury the car has leather bucket seats , wooden steering wheel and the famous @entity71 gate gear shifter			1
the car has been restored immaculately by @entity3 specialists the car is not fitted with a stereo as this would interfere with the sound from the v12 engine while there is even room in the back for two very short people @entity82 , managing director of @entity46 in @entity83 , said : ' the @entity4 factor is simply immeasurable			1
' there is nothing better to spend your money on than a @entity4 @entity3			2
' @entity4 's @entity3 was controversially - and expensively - transformed from a coupe into a convertible after he sold it			1
but mr @entity37 , decided to spend a six - figure sum giving the car its @entity4 factor back			1
he gave it to @entity3 's @entity96 department which restored the car to how it looked when the screen icon had owned it			0
the staggering fee paid for the @entity3 is the latest example of the ' @entity101 ' , where people pay over the odds for cars owned by the late actor			2
in 2011 , his old @entity106 sold for £ 830,000 - more than 12 times its typical value			0
the car has 14,243 miles on the clock , but having been owned by @entity4 , many of those miles would have been north of 100mph the car underwent a six - figure restoration			0
@entity82 of @entity46 said : ' there is nothing better to spend your money on than a @entity4 @entity3 ' according to mr @entity82 , having @entity4 's name on a car 's logbook increases the value of the vehicle several times over as he is still ' @entity4 ' mr @entity82 had previously said the car ' ticks all the boxes when it comes to collectability '			2
under the bonnet of the @entity3 275 @entity62 / 4 is a 3.3 - litre v12 engine which develops 300bhp			1
@entity3 said the @entity4 275 was ' one of the more interesting cars ever to leave the factory '			0
while unconfirmed , it is thought the @entity3 has been sold to a very wealthy @entity1 car collector , who was bidding over the telephone			2
however , the @entity133 was not @entity134 , who has been in @entity47 for the week			0
but the @entity136 presenter , who is known for his car collection , was involved in the record - breaking @entity139 auction on thursday night			0
@entity140 said he bid $ 30 million for the @entity3 , but still missed out			0
the 250 gto is also thought to have gone to a @entity1 buyer			0
the front engined rear - wheel drive sports car was capable of 165 mph in 1967 and produced 300bhp from its three - litre v12 engine able to hit 60mph in just 6.5 seconds			0

@entity4 bought the 1967 @entity3 @entity62 / 4 while filming the classic movie @entity7 in @entity147
@entity4 kept the car until 1971 when he sold it to fellow actor @entity27 who starred in @entity150 and @entity29
a later owner cut the roof off the car , turning the *stylish* coupe into a convertible also reducing the value
enthusiast @entity37 spent six - figures after he *commissioned* experts to return the car to its *original* *condition*
an *anonymous* @entity1 phone bidder paid £ 6 million at auction in @entity48 for the 165mph v12 super car
