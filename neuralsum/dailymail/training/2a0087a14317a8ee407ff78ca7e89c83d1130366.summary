by @entity0 on sunday reporter the operation @entity3 – the surgical removal of the uterus and cervix , and sometimes fallopian tubes , ovaries and pelvic lymph nodes			1
usually carried out to treat or prevent cancer , or remove benign tumours , it may involve an incision in the abdomen , but can be carried out through the vagina or via keyhole surgery			1
all options involve a general anaesthetic			1
operation : a hysterectomy is the surgical removal of the uterus and cervix , and sometimes fallopian tubes , ovaries and pelvic lymph nodes the surgeon says mr @entity25 , consultant gynaecologist at @entity26 and @entity27 , says : ‘ the fitter you are before surgery the quicker you ’ll recover			1
you can get abdominal and back pain after surgery so taking nurofen before the op will help			1
‘ get moving as soon as you can afterwards as this speeds recovery			1
start with some gentle walking			1
do n’t go swimming until the wound has completely healed to avoid infection , and do n’t lift anything heavier than a full kettle until you are fully recovered to give abdominal muscles time to knit			1
‘ consider the layout of your home			2
will the bed be within easy access of the bathroom ? can you avoid stairs ? ‘ some bleeding is normal but if it goes on for a few days or is heavy or painful , see your doctor			2
use sanitary towels rather than tampons to help reduce the risk of infection			2
recovery : you can get abdominal and back pain after a hysterectomy ‘ opt for showers rather than baths , and avoid fragranced soaps as they can irritate			1
keeping up fluid intake and having plenty of fruit and fibre in your diet will help with bowel or bladder movements			2
‘ wear loose - fitting clothes and avoid tight underwear			2
if your ovaries have been removed , it may bring on menopausal hot flushes			2
you may be offered @entity75 , so discuss this with your doctor			0
’ the patient says @entity78 , 52 , a special - needs teacher from @entity79 , had the operation three years ago after suffering with fibroids and anaemia			1
she says : ‘ i knew i was going to be immobile so before i went into hospital i made sure everything i ’d need was within easy reach			0
i also had a bikini wax – psychologically , it made me feel better			0
‘ i took plenty of pairs of big knickers and large sanitary towels into hospital			0
there was some bleeding and the only thing they give you in hospital are incontinence pads , which are depressing to wear			0
i also took in a v - shaped body pillow to support my lower back			0
‘ i was catheterised , which i do n’t remember anyone telling me about , and it was a shock to discover this			0
the catheter can be in for up to 24 hours			0
‘ you can get a lot of wind pain after the operation since it can make you constipated , and so drinking some peppermint tea was invaluable			1
‘ i felt unstable on my feet when i first started moving around – having comfortable supportive shoes is vital			0
‘ prepare friends and family for how emotional you might feel			0
my two sons were 16 and 19 at the time and we had no intention of having more children , yet there was still a sense of loss which made me very emotional			0
you need people around you to support you through that			0
