by @entity0 it 's one very , very small step for man - but a giant leap for antkind			0
around 800 common ants , usually found pattering across pavements and picnics , have been sent to the @entity8 to teach scientists how they move in low gravity			1
eight colonies each about the size of a tablet computer have been set up to teach experts how to build robots which interact with each other			2
welcome : @entity18 astronaut @entity17 greets 800 new friends aboard the @entity8			1
scientists will study how ants work together in low gravity and copy their methods to develop robots @entity26 steps : each of the eight colonies is the size of a tablet computer and can be expanded to examine how the insects work together in different - sized environments as the colonies are expanded , the ants move from small circles to straight lines to cover more ground houseguests : the colonies were delivered alongside @entity39 presents for @entity8 astronauts it is because ants inside colonies move according to internalised rules , judging how many other ants are nearby by touching antenna and using their sense of smell			1
working together , the ants cover a piece of ground comprehensively to find food and supplies			1
when the area expands they change from moving in small circles to scuttling in straighter lines , covering more ground			0
but in the micro gravity of space , the ants ' rules are confounded and they have to develop a new set of innate principles by which to work			1
these flexible principles could then be adapted to instruct robots to work together in the same way , for tasks like searching a burning building			2
video cameras are trained on the experiment and images of the pavement ants , as they are known , are being beamed back to @entity73			1
close - up : the images will be beamed back to @entity73			0
pictured : @entity18 flight engineer @entity76 significant : the experiment could help develop robots which search disaster zones or burning buildings these will be monitored by students at the @entity83 in @entity84 , @entity85 , and compared to a similar colony in their classroom			1
@entity89 , a professor at @entity90 , the private firm which launched the mission , told @entity92 : ' when ant densities are high , each ant thoroughly searches one small area in a circular , â € ˜ randomâ € ™ walk			0
' when ant densities are low , each ant searches by walking in a relatively straight line , allowing it to cover more ground			0
' the unusual cargo was delivered by an unmanned supply rocket this week which also included 28 mini-satellites known as @entity105			0
each less than 2ft across , they contain ultra high definition cameras which could track crop harvests , climate change and natural disasters like wildfires and floods			0
the cargo also included @entity39 presents for those aboard the @entity8 - which were supposed to be delivered last month			2
the ants ' launch had to be delayed several times after emergency repairs , @entity120 's ' polar vortex ' of cold weather and a strong solar storm all intervened .			0

800 common pavement ants are now living on @entity8
scientists will examine how they work together in low gravity to find food
the ants ' methods can then be copied to develop ' *intelligent* ' search robots
