@entity1 chief executive @entity0 rejects the argument that increasing the salary cap will create an uneven playing field			1
@entity1 clubs will be able to spend up to £ 5.5million on their wage bill for the 2015 - 16 season , a £ 500,000 rise on the current figure			1
it has also been agreed that they can sign a second marquee player whose salary falls outside the cap			1
@entity15 director of rugby @entity16 insist that clubs may to ratify a second salary cap sir @entity19 is among those who have voiced concerns that the increase will create a two - tier @entity1			1
@entity0 stresses that while inequality will always exist , all clubs will be able to compete because of the way revenue is allocated			1
" the salary cap is linked as a percentage to the money we distribute centrally from tv rights and the big sponsorship deals , " said @entity0 , who was speaking at the @entity26			1
" it 's geared in such a way that as the business grows , so too does the salary cap			1
" because the business is growing , more money is being distributed to the clubs and they get an equal share of that			2
" the only difference then is the scale of a club 's business			2
if you have bigger revenue from bigger attendance , then you 'll be in a slightly more advantageous position			0
" but it was ever thus , you ca n't level the playing field in everything			0
" in fact we believe it is the reverse of an unlevel playing field - the extra money will allow the clubs to continue developing , particularly their academies			2
" @entity0 added that the future introduction of a third marquee player is unlikely			1
@entity1 is confident that the off - field support offered to players will prevent large numbers departing for @entity63 after next year 's @entity64			2
@entity66 's @entity65 was forced into moving to @entity63 to chase the money at @entity68 @entity66 have a policy of only picking stars based overseas in ' exceptional circumstances ' , so persuading them to turn down lucrative offers from the @entity73 is in the interests of club and country			0
while the financial rewards in @entity63 are great , club budgets are spent on recruitment and wages at the expense of medical support and development			0
@entity86 fly - half @entity84 is to rejoin @entity87 when his two - year contract at @entity89 expires at the end of the season , while the @entity93 exodus has produced mixed fortunes			0
" it 's not a big worry , we just want to make sure we 're in the best possible position to make sure we retain the talent we have , " @entity0 said			2
" the salary cap is one aspect that helps us do that , but there 's also the player welfare stuff we do off the field such as post career development			1
" for most players it 's a package , not just what they 're paid			0
" a lot of players who have been to @entity63 , which is the natural market , have come back with some pretty poor experiences off the pitch			0
" @entity115 have made a few comments about a few of their players currently playing in @entity63 who are n't coming back into international camp in the best condition			0
" the players are aware of these and for some of them it makes sense to move , for others it does n't			0
hopefully those who do n't are in the majority			0

@entity0 says everyone will still be able to compete with salary cap
@entity1 clubs will be able to spend up to £ 5.5m on their wage bill
this is a rise of £ 500,000 on the current figure available
