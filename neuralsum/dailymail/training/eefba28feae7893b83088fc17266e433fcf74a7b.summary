by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 13:49 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 15:17 est , 7 august 2013 the trial of the @entity4 shooter has been abruptly stopped after just one day in session as an attorney has claimed that the @entity8 psychiatrist is purposefully trying to be granted the death penalty for killing 13 people on the @entity12 military base			1
a standby attorney in the case said that @entity15 , who chose to represent himself in the case without the help of a lawyer , is intentionally trying to get the death sentence for the 2009 rampage			1
lt. col. @entity21 , @entity15 's lead court - appointed standby attorney , said he is willing to step in and be @entity15 's defense lawyer but asked that his responsibilities as co-counsel be minimized if @entity15 continues to work toward being executed			1
it is ' clear his goal is to remove impediments or obstacles to the death penalty and is working toward a death penalty , ' @entity21 told the judge overseeing the case at the @entity12 military base			1
that 's a twist of the facts			0
' the judge , col. @entity50 , then cleared the courtroom			0
@entity15 has chosen to act as his own attorney during the military trial at @entity4 , though he has defense attorneys on standby if he needs them			2
admitted shooter : @entity15 , seen here in 2010 , is representing himself in his own defense as he faces the death penalty for allegedly killing 13 people on @entity61 base in 2009 on tuesday , he told jurors during a less than 2 - minute opening statement that the evidence would ' clearly show ' he was the shooter , but that it would ' only show one side			1
' he also questioned only two of the first dozen witnesses , who included one soldier who was shot seven times during the november 2009 attack on the sprawling @entity8 post			1
@entity15 is charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder			1
if convicted , he would face the death penalty			2
@entity21 said @entity15 was acting as his own attorney in a way that , ' we believe is repugnant to defense counsel and contrary to our professional obligations			2
' @entity15 repeatedly asked the judge to allow him to explain why @entity21 's claim was wrong , saying : ' your honor , col. @entity21 has made an assertion that is inaccurate			2
i 'd like to clarify that			0
' @entity50 paused for nearly half minute before asking that @entity15 explain his argument in writing			0
he said he would n't do that			0
@entity50 then closed the courtroom to discuss the matter			0
no witnesses were called wednesday			0
@entity15 , an @entity98 - born muslim who was paralyzed after being shot by officers responding to the attack , said he was as a soldier who switched sides in what he described as a war between @entity98 and his @entity107 faith			1
@entity15 wanted to plead guilty to murder and attempted murder , but military rules forbid guilty pleas in death penalty cases			1
precautions : armed guards ( seen here tuesday ) surround the courthouse on the @entity12 military base high security : all cars are being checked for explosives as @entity4 is operating under extreme caution during the trial @entity15 had also asked to argue that he carried out the shooting in ' defense of others , ' namely members of the @entity127 fighting in @entity128 , but the judge denied that strategy			1
his defense strategy still remains unclear			0
during tuesday 's testimony , he occasionally took notes on a legal pad			0
while two defense attorneys remained on stand - by , @entity15 rarely turned to them for advice			2
no @entity98 soldier has been executed since 1961 , and military prosecutors showed that they would take no chance of fumbling details that could jeopardize any conviction down the line			0
connected : the government has said that @entity15 , a @entity98 - born @entity144 , had sent more than a dozen emails starting in december 2008 to @entity146 , a radical @entity98 - born @entity107 cleric killed by a drone strike in @entity148 the long - delayed trial was years in the making after judges in the case had granted a series of delays			1
a fight over @entity15 's beard , which violates military regulations , led to a stay shortly before his trial was expected to begin last year and eventual replacement of the judge			2
the trial is playing out amid high security at @entity4 , where armed guards stood in doorways and 15 - foot stacks of shock - absorbing barriers obscured the view of the courthouse			0
jurors were told to prepare for a trial that could take months , and @entity15 , who is in a wheelchair , needs regular breaks .			0

maj. @entity15 is charged with killing 13 people in november 2009 shooting rampage inside @entity61 base
was working as an @entity8 psychiatrist but had been *communicating* with a radical cleric in @entity148 for a year before the shooting
@entity15 , now paralyzed after being shot in the back by first responders during the attack , will be representing himself without the help of a lawyer
judge already ruled that he could not say he opened fire ' in defense of others ' , as he argued that he was *saving* the @entity127 in @entity128
he faces the death penalty but now lawyers have *intervened* saying that he may be trying to throw the case , to make sure he is sentenced to death
