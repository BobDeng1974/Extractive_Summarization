teenager @entity0 had just seen his @entity2 side knocked out in the @entity4 group stage when the email landed from club chairman – @entity7 – that he had been fired			1
that , of course , was the virtual world of football manager			0
on friday , @entity2 defender @entity0 – now 22 - can help steer his uncle 's club back towards the big time for real			1
the @entity16 under 21 star was a kid in the playground when his dad 's brother was splashing the cash on @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 , before that there had been the likes of @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28			2
@entity2 defender @entity0 , 22 , is dreaming of a return to the @entity31 for his boyhood club his uncle , @entity2 chairman @entity33 , has overseen some of the most significant times in the club 's history midfielder @entity21 ( right ) is widely considered to be one of @entity2 's greatest - ever players , and starred in @entity0 's foray into computerised football management during his teenage years @entity33 helped save the @entity42 from liquidation in 1986 and eight years later took control , his investment seeing them win the @entity47 in 2004 and reach the final of the @entity49 in 2006			1
but six consecutive seasons outside of the @entity31 has proved a financial strain			1
that is why @entity0 readily labels the televised clash at @entity54 – one point above them and second in the @entity57 - as the biggest match in the club 's history			1
' the way the @entity31 is and the gap financially makes this our biggest game ever , ' said the centre - back			0
' if we get back in the @entity31 it 's different to the last time we were there			1
it has more of an impact , financially , than what the cup finals did			0
' it 's £ 100m for going up , that is irreplaceable			2
it will have a bigger effect on the club and the town than winning the @entity47			2
' @entity77 - born @entity0 is a lifelong @entity2 fan			1
he was there when they beat @entity80 at @entity82 's @entity81 to lift the first trophy in the club 's history and again in @entity86 two years later when @entity87 ran out 4 - 0 winners			1
he eclipsed all of that , however , in his bedroom at home			0
' i was always @entity2 boss on football manager – and i was pretty good , ' he recalled			1
@entity2 captain @entity95 ( left ) leads the club 's celebrations after winning the 2004 @entity47 @entity87 's @entity98 ( left ) shoots during the 2006 @entity49 final , in which his side beat @entity2 4 - 0 ' my uncle always gave me loads to spend ! the best i got was the group stage of the @entity4			1
we got knocked out without making the second round and he gave me the bullet ! ' but in the real world i leave all that business to him			0
and if we do go up then i 'll be hoping that he keeps hold of me ! ' there is no danger of that not happening			0
@entity0 has been a rock at the heart of the division 's best defence – they have conceded 10 fewer than any rival – and will be part of @entity95 's @entity16 squad for this summer 's euros in the @entity123			1
perhaps , then , promotion and an impressive showing for his country will silence all accusations of nepotism			0
' i do n't mind people saying that i 'm only here because of my uncle , it motivates me , ' he said			0
' you would think playing for @entity16 kills that talk anyway – because i do n't think my uncle picks the @entity16 squad			2
' but i 'm used to it			0
i 've had it all my life and it drives me on			0
' were @entity0 ever to let up , then his @entity2 - supporting pals would be onto him long before his uncle			1
they are even more anxious than he is as the tightest promotion race in @entity57 history nears its conclusion			0
' my mates are stressing out more than me , ' said @entity0			1
' it 's better for me because it 's in my hands			2
after every game i come in and it ' s like heart - attack material in our whatsapp group – it 's incredible			2
' but they believe in us and that 's massive			0
they feel we deserve that promotion			0
' and i think my uncle deserves it too			0
his loyalty and what he has put in deserves reward with promotion back to the @entity31			0
' given the ambition of his uncle , perhaps then @entity0 can aim to right the wrongs of his previous adventure in the @entity4			2
@entity2 's @entity166 ( left ) fires at goal during the victory against @entity170 on tuesday @entity171 ( centre ) surges forward for @entity2 and is hassled by @entity170 ' @entity173 ( right ) at the @entity174			1

@entity2 's @entity0 is nephew of club chairman @entity7
as a teenager he used to play as @entity2 on @entity179
the @entity181 have spent six consecutive seasons outside of top *flight*
@entity185 believes the squad has what it takes to secure a return to the big time
