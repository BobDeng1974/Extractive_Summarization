@entity11 have played eight hours and 42 minutes of @entity13 football and failed to score			1
it 's hard not to sympathise with their supporters			2
football without goals ultimately becomes meaningless			2
and though the attempt by some fans to demonstrate their discontent by boycotting the first eight minutes of the game had fallen flat , a more spontaneous protest â€“ that of missing the last eight minutes of the match when the game was up - was much better supported , a steady stream of fans heading for the exits			1
those that stayed chanted : ' we want @entity31 out ' in reference to the owner , @entity33			2
but he has put the club up for sale and there is no queue forming along the @entity39 to buy so @entity11 must continue as they are , seemingly always fighting relegation			1
at @entity7 , it 's always winter and never @entity42			2

' it 's been like that for three years , four years , five years , the same , ' said @entity90 of another season immersed in the mire of relegation worries			1
' there 's no rest bite whatsoever			0
you meet it head on			0
come the end of the season you make sure you 're out if it			0
' that said , @entity61 objected when it was suggested that might be the best @entity11 can expect			1
' absolutely no way , ' he said			0
' a club of this size should not be in the position it is			0
it 's got to get up there			0
certainly nobody likes it at the club			0
i do n't like it , the chairman does n't like it , the chief executive does n't like it , the players do n't like it , the fans do n't like it			2
' putting it right is a harder task			0
amidst the depression though , there was a team rediscovering itself			0
not @entity11 of course ; it 's hard to fathom what they stand for at present			1
@entity50 though are quietly rebuilding a little of swagger of last season			1
they are of course a long way from those heights at present			0
perhaps the return of @entity169 will nudge them a little further in that direction			0
but at times they give glimpses of the free - spirited side that captivated the nation last season			1
it 's now eight games undefeated since they lost to @entity176 , the game in which @entity178 's completely changed to a back three			0
' we re-gained our identity in how the team has played for two years , ' said @entity109			0
' it was fair to say that the opening four months or so of the season we were just nowhere near what we had been so we needed to find a solution to that			0
even though we lost the @entity176 game i saw enough in the dynamic of the team to know that could be a way forward for us			0
' @entity98 missed a good chance to make it 2 - 0 to @entity50 against @entity11 during the @entity13 match @entity43 scuffs a shot that hits the post against @entity11 as he looks to make it 2 - 0 to @entity50 in the @entity13 @entity50 goalkeeper @entity91 stays alert to deny @entity11 's @entity80 ( right ) @entity11 manager @entity90 ( left ) and @entity69 ( right ) react during their @entity13 match against @entity50 @entity11 manager @entity61 has been under pressure as he went into the @entity13 match against @entity109 ( right ) @entity201 miles @entity11 107.7 66.9 @entity76 90 10.9 6.8 @entity73 90 10.9 6.7 @entity69 90 10.5 6.5 @entity50 109.8 68.2 @entity64 90 11.3 7.0 @entity100 90 11.1 6.9 @entity94 90 10.8 6.7 so much so , that @entity50 have begun to eye the top four again			1
' if we can get through to the end of january and be somewhere near then , as we showed last year , we can put a run together which can see us in there			0
it 's still the objective			0
it 's a real young exciting team and you see that in some of the football we played today			0
it was there in @entity95 's marauding runs , @entity100 's sublime passing and @entity64 's determined leadership			0
perhaps more importantly it was there in the performances of @entity93 and @entity222 and the much - maligned @entity91 , ' outstanding ' according to @entity219 and indeed responsible for crucial saves when @entity50 looked to be squandering chances			1

it should have been 2 - 0 on 38 minutes when @entity97 header put @entity98 through on goal			1
with just @entity68 to beat and with a firm striker needed , he opted for an elaborate chip , only to see the ball land tamely into @entity68 's hands			0
there were some positives for @entity11 , even amidst the gloom			1
the performance was some way better than the defeat at @entity246 last weekend			0
there was the arrival of @entity75 on the hour ' as good a debut as i 've seen ' according to @entity61 - who , along with @entity78 , injected purpose into @entity11 's offesnive play			1

@entity80 came closest in that second half period , feeding off a headed @entity71 flick - on to unleash a ferocious shot which @entity91 blocked well			2
the @entity50 keeper was then straight up to punch away a @entity78 shot			2
encouraged and emboldened , the @entity7 roared its support and @entity71 went close on 67 minutes , heading over from a corner			2
' i thought we were excellent in the second half , we were relentless and the goalkeeper has had a half , ' said @entity61			1
' the goals will come			0
' yet , ultimately it would not prove enough			0
there is still not enough attacking intent from @entity11 in long enough periods and @entity50 simply kept prodding and eventually they did get the goal they had long threatened			1
it came when @entity98 played in substitute @entity61 , who controlled the ball and draggedit back it one delightful movement which landed @entity72 on his backside			1
@entity61 then matched the build - up with a high - quality finish , striking the ball into the far corner beyond @entity68			1
the clock showed 80 minutes and at the stage the @entity7 did begin to empty			2
