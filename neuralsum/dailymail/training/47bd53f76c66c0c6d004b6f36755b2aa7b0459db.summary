by @entity0 @entity1 : 10:50 est , 18 december 2013 @entity2 : 02:53 est , 19 december 2013 no wonder the prime minister looks aghast			0
he is standing inside a squalid shed in the back garden of a suburban @entity8 house			1
it has a concrete floor , a half - built roof open to the wintry sky , and is strewn with dirty mattresses , battered suitcases and plastic bags			1
yet yesterday it emerged that the shack , with one of its four walls missing and covered instead by a blue cotton sheet , is home to a number of @entity24 immigrants living illegally in @entity25			2
@entity26 : the prime minister appears taken aback as he is confronted by the rubbish , piled up suitcases and grubby blankets of this wretched squat in an outbuilding in @entity33 in total 14 people were living a three - bedroom home and the shack built in the garden			1
the inhabitants are just a few of the tens of thousands of new arrivals who pay shadowy landlords exorbitant rents to stay in so - called ‘ beds in sheds ’ in back gardens across outer @entity8 and the @entity46			1
as the country struggles to accommodate the huge numbers of immigrants arriving here – both legally and illegally – this is often the sad and degrading fate that awaits them			2
the scene of squalor , hidden away behind a house in an avenue in @entity33 , @entity8 , where property prices top £ 400,000 , is all too common			1
crackdown : some 10 officers raided the house at 5am yesterday , making three arrests with more expected quiet : the property used to house 14 illegal immigrants sits on this quiet residential street in @entity33 , @entity8 ( general view ) a government crackdown on immigration is ' really spitting in the wind of the problem we face ' , a @entity67 mp warned yesterday			1
@entity73 also predicted that new benefit restrictions would be found illegal in the @entity76 courts			0
he added ' the only way to get control of our borders back , and control of our benefits system , is to leave the @entity83			2
' but @entity84 insisted that ministers had taken legal advice on limiting access to benefits to those who have been in the @entity25 for three months			1
' there is a right to work in different countries of the @entity83 but there should n't be a right to claim in different countries of the @entity83 , ' the @entity90 said			1
earlier this year , the local council – @entity98 – estimated that the inhabitants of bed sheds has pushed the area ’s population up by 60,000 to nearly 400,000			0
it has meant schools struggle to cope with huge increases in pupils			0
@entity108 surgeries and health services are overwhelmed while rubbish collection and sanitation services reel under the extra burden			0
i have seen the appalling conditions in which these newcomers live for myself			0
earlier this year i visited neighbouring @entity118 , a borough where there are 20,000 gardens with ramshackle sheds or outbuildings of all sizes , a lot of them rented out illegally to migrants , mainly from @entity24			2
as local councillor @entity125 told me : ‘ once , it was a rural scene around here			0
now , many areas resemble shanty towns			0
’ i was led by a council enforcement team to a cream - painted house on a leafy road which looked perfectly respectable			1
yet in the back garden was a jerry - built shack thrown together with breeze blocks – and distinct signs of human habitation			2
when i poked my head inside the door , the smell made my eyes water			0
message : the prime minister said it was vital to send home people who do n't have a right to be here the tiny , cramped outbuilding was home to eight @entity24 illegally living in @entity25 , including a young woman , who paid hundreds of pounds a month to a rogue landlord who owned a thriving grocery shop a few miles away			0
at the time of my visit , @entity118 had already inspected more than 2,000 bed sheds in its area – and was still counting			0
when discovered , some are torn down because they break planning rules			0
all too often though , red tape and lax laws mean that the landlord receives only a warning			0
the council must also give home - owners 24 hours ’ notice of an inspection , which , of course , gives them ample time to clear out a back - garden shack			2
illegal : mr @entity84 said he wanted to see more raids being made of properties used to house people in the @entity25 illegally in @entity8 suburbs and the @entity46 it is thought that tens of thousands bed sheds now exist , each housing up to ten people			1
it is a huge secret population living under the radar			0
' we are dealing with the mess that we inherited from @entity183 , when immigration was completely out of control ' prime minister @entity84 yesterday mr @entity84 was confronting the harsh reality of a decade or more of uncontrolled migration and the utter misery it can bring to everyone – including the migrants themselves			1
mr @entity84 said it was vital to ‘ send home people who do n’t have a right to be here ’ , as he set out plans to prevent migrants claiming benefits for three months after arriving in @entity25			1
he also said landlords would risk big fines if they fail to check the status of their tenants under the terms of a new @entity205			0
curbs : the visit came after the government announced it was rushing forward legislation to stop migrants claiming benefits for the first three months they are in @entity25 briefing : mr @entity84 was told that the three - bedroom house had been converted into 10 bedrooms and up to 14 people in the house ‘ we are dealing with the mess that we inherited from @entity183 , when immigration was completely out of control , ’ the prime minister said			1
ten officers raided the terraced house at 5am and made three arrests of @entity24 nationals			1
the government is scrambling to toughen its immigration message as @entity25 is forced to remove restrictions on incomers from @entity229 and @entity230 on january 1			0
ministers have set out a series of measures to limit migrant access to public services and benefits			2
landlords will be fined up to £ 3,000 if they rent a property to an illegal immigrant			2
but more than 70 @entity67 @entity240 are calling for mr @entity84 to go further and flout @entity83 rules by extending the controls on @entity229 and @entity230 migrants until 2018 .			1
