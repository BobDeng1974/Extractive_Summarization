professional polo player @entity0 has revealed his plans to try and change society 's view of his sport , which he admits many see as elitist , expensive and overly flashy			1
in an interview with luxury menswear website mr @entity7 , the 31 - year - old , who is ranked the number one polo player in the @entity10 , explained that polo is not just about wealthy athletes enjoying a glamorous lifestyle - and insisted that the sport can be pursued by almost anyone			1
' a lot of people think of polo as a lifestyle and not an actual sport , ' he said			0
' [ i 'm on a mission to ] bring the masses towards the sport			0
it 's not just about horses and divorces : @entity0 insists that there is more to the sport than glamour and luxury hard working : the 31 - year - old looks after 30 polo ponies and travels for half of the year ' ... who knows if polo will get to the magnitude of tennis or golf – but i think it has the potential to grow			1
' but while he is eager to help alter the public perception of the sport , @entity0 does admit that he has indulged in the more lavish aspects of the polo lifestyle			2
having been rocketed to sporting stardom at age 15 , when he became the youngest ever player to win the @entity52 , the sporting legend quickly allowed himself to become caught up in a world of jet - set luxury and excitement			2
' i arrive [ at a tournement ] and i have a car , an apartment on the ocean , no parental guidance , ' he said of his teen years spent on the international polo circuit			0
' i think , " wow , this is fun			0
i can keep doing this			0
" ' model behavior : @entity0 has starred in numerous campaigns for @entity68 's @entity67 and is represented by @entity70 - based agency @entity69 social butterfly : @entity0 ensures he puts in as much effort socializing with the other players and team owners as he does focusing on the game itself nowadays , @entity0 tends to live a slightly more low - key lifestyle , focusing on his playing schedule , his strict training regime - and , most importantly , caring for his 30 polo ponies			1
the part - time model , who has starred in numerous campaigns for @entity68 's @entity67 and is represented by @entity70 - based agency @entity69 , spends half of the year traveling to matches			1
during that time , @entity0 ensures he puts in as much effort socializing with the other players and team owners - which he sees as a ' vital ' aspect of polo - as he does focusing on the game itself			1
' the owners do it because they love the sport , and horses , but they also love what it brings – the dinners and cocktail parties , ' he explained			0
' so as an athlete , you have to be very sociable			0
it ’s always come naturally for me			0
' polo prodigy : @entity0 became the youngest player to ever win the @entity52 when he stormed to victory aged 15 aiming for the top : @entity0 ’s ambition is to reach 10 - goal status and win the @entity110 and while @entity111 has now spent more than half his life on the professional polo circuit , he is in no rush to give up the sport any time soon - and , in fact , is hoping to achieve much more within the sport before he even considers retiring			1
the @entity70 - based athlete is one of only five players in the world to hold an eight - goal handicap in the sport , and he is only the third @entity10 in history to have achieved that status			2
but while his past achievements are impressive , @entity0 is working towards become one of the few players to ever achieve a 10 - goal handicap			1
