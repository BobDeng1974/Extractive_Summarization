the lush countryside of @entity7 , in south - east @entity5 , proved an irresistible draw for such luminaries as poets @entity10 and @entity12 , and @entity13 and @entity14			1
as they embarked upon their trek - possibly inspired by @entity19 's book observations on the @entity20 - they would have come across @entity21 , a beautiful country retreat to the north of @entity24			1
designed by @entity27 architect @entity26 , it was commissioned in 1785 by @entity29 banker @entity28 , and was heralded as a neoclassical masterpiece ... but today , it lies in ruins			1
the latter purchased the property from @entity28 after he went bankrupt			0
after passing through several owners - and serving as a base for @entity53 troops to conduct @entity55 exercises in 1944 - it was bought by billionaire businessmen brothers @entity57 and @entity59 , albeit indirectly through a subsidiary company			1
no one is quite sure why the brothers allowed the house to fall into disrepair			2

he specialised in the neoclassical style of design and his architectural works are distinguished by their clean lines , decisive detailing , careful proportions and skilful use of light			0
the influence of his work , coming at the end of the @entity94 era , was swamped by the revival styles of the 19th century			0
it was not until the late 19th century that his influence was widely felt			0
his best - known work was the @entity100 , a building which had a widespread effect on commercial architecture			0
he also designed @entity104 , which , with its top - lit galleries , was a major influence on the planning of subsequent art galleries and museums			0
his main legacy is sir @entity111 , in @entity112 , @entity113			0
he received a knighthood in 1831 , six years before his death at the age of 84			0
@entity113 - based art dealer @entity117 attempted to buy @entity118 when it was put up for sale two years ago , offering £ 1million			1
the offer was rejected - and adding £ 300,000 to his bid made no difference			1
the @entity123 declined to comment on the matter			0
now , the house is firmly on the radar of a conservation group which is determined to save the @entity129 * - listed building from further decay			1
campaigners from @entity70 are hoping to acquire a @entity71 ( @entity72 ) or possibly turn the house over to a trust			1
@entity134 , co-founder and president of @entity70 told the @entity136 : ' @entity117 's was a handsome offer			1
@entity77 really is an important house			0
' it 's a fine early work by @entity26 wrapped around an older @entity141 house that might have been by @entity142 [ sir @entity143 's assistant ] , and there 's evidence the house has @entity147 or even earlier origins			0
' it 's also hugely important in terms of the romantic movement and , because of its location , it 's truly a gateway to @entity5			2
' @entity77 is listed as a ruin , @entity156 , the @entity5 government 's historic environment service , is unable to serve an order for repairs on the owners			2
however , hope remains if other @entity26 house are anything to go by : @entity165 in @entity166 and @entity167 in @entity168 are among those that have recently been saved			0
among the @entity123 ' companies is @entity172			0
its portfolio includes @entity24 racecourse , whose track is on land that was once part of the @entity118 estate			2
a source close to the @entity181 told the @entity136 that no realistic offer has been made for the house : ' over the past two years , the only people who 've expressed an interest are conservationists			1
' if anyone wants to make a serious offer , they 're welcome to contact the company direct			2
