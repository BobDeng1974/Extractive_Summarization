by @entity0 if you yawn and the person next to you follows suit , do n’t worry – you are not boring them			0
rather , it is a good sign , for it means they really like you			0
a scientific study suggests ‘ contagious ’ yawns are a sign of deep empathy			1
they are caused by an irrepressible need to share and understand the emotions and feelings of others			2
the ‘ catching yawn ’ is caused by an irrepressible need to share and understand the emotions and feelings of others , scientists said the ‘ emotional bridge ’ created by the shared experience enhances social bonding , the @entity28 scientists say			1
researchers who monitored 33 adults over 380 hours , recording 1,375 yawns , found that a yawn was far more likely to spread – and did so more quickly – among friends and relatives			1
the scientists also tracked the way yawns spread among bonobos , the species of chimpanzee most closely related to humans			2
they monitored the apes for 800 hours , and found that a yawn ‘ wave ’ was just as likely to be triggered among bonobos as it is in humans			1
the impact of friendship , however , was not evident among the chimpanzees			0
researchers tracked the way yawns spread among bonobos ( pictured ) , a species of chimpanzee closest related to humans			2

the ‘ catching yawn ’ is caused by an irrepressible need to share and understand the emotions and feelings of others			1
the ‘ emotional bridge ’ created by the shared experience enhances social bonding , according to @entity28 scientists			1
in an experiment , they found that a yawn was far more likely to spread among groups of friends			1
the researchers concluded that human ability to feel empathy is far stronger between friends and relatives			1
biologists believe contagious yawns are caused by an involuntary re-enactment of the facial expression seen in others			2
they think ‘ mirror neurons ’ in the pre-frontal cortex - the brain region involved in social behaviour - fire when certain expressions are seen in other people , prompting us to instinctively copy them			0
the new research suggests that this ‘ mirror system ’ is strongest between people who are emotionally attached , probably by shared memories			0
a yawn was just as likely to spread between unrelated primates as it was between family members			0
the researchers concluded that human ability to feel empathy is far stronger between friends and relatives			1
they wrote in the journal @entity108 : ‘ humans ’ responses were more frequent and faster when the trigger and responder shared a strong emotional bond			0
' humans show a different degree of sensitivity ... but only when they are strongly emotionally involved			0
’ biologists believe contagious yawns are caused by an involuntary copying of the facial expression seen in others			2
they think mirror neurons in the pre-frontal cortex – the part of the brain involved in social behaviour – are triggered when certain expressions are seen in others , prompting us to copy them instinctively			0

the scientists , from universities in @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 , believe the difference between humans and bonobos is most profound when it comes to the strongest of our social bonds , particularly those shared with friends and family members			1
but when it comes to strangers , the results suggest we possess no more empathy than the apes do			0
@entity154 scientists have previously found that babies and young children are immune to waves of contagious yawning			2
research by psychologists at the @entity161 , published in 2010 , established that after the age of 11 , children react to yawns in the same way as adults .			0

scientists from universities in @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 found that the ' catching yawn ' is caused by a need to understand the feelings of others
the ' emotional bridge ’ created by yawning enhances social bonding

human ability to feel empathy is far stronger between friends and relatives
yawns are also contagious in groups of apes , but do *n't* signify friendship
