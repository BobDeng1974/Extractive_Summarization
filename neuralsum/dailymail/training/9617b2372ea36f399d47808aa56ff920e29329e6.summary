’ a special investigation by @entity43 can also reveal : the disclosure that @entity8 , 44 , has been suffering physical difficulties alongside inevitable mental turmoil must have added to the distress of his wife @entity25 , who lives in @entity49 with their four - year - old daughter , and family in @entity53 during their agonising wait for news			1
a security source familiar with the cases described the hostages ’ internment as a ‘ living hell ’			2
mr @entity8 , originally from @entity62 in @entity53 , has been badly tortured , especially during the first six months after his abduction in march last year at a refugee camp in northern @entity5			1
the father - of - two has been severely tortured and given electric shock ‘ punishments ’ with @entity71 by the group of @entity1 jihadis led by ‘ @entity68 ’ and nicknamed @entity72 he may have been singled out for such brutal treatment because of his nationality			1
one freed hostage said guards talked often about the 2003 invasion of @entity78			0
@entity80 videos show @entity1 and @entity82 captives dressed in orange jumpsuits , a clear reference to prisoners at @entity86			1
the most recent video showed a gaunt @entity90 held by the collar as a black - clad , @entity88 extremist warned @entity1 to abandon ‘ this evil alliance of @entity82 ’			1
mr @entity8 has been given electric shocks with @entity71 as ‘ punishments ’ by a group that included at least one of ‘ @entity72 ’ , the @entity1 jihadis linked to the kidnap and killing of @entity100 and @entity101			1
like other hostages , the @entity102 has been moved repeatedly because of chaotic infighting among @entity5 rebels and possibly to evade raids from special forces			2
at one point he was held with @entity100 and @entity101 and some of the 15 @entity110 who have been released after ransoms were paid			0
mr @entity8 was working for @entity113 aid group @entity112 ) when he was grabbed within sight of the @entity116 border			1
it is understood he had time to notify his superiors but could not escape			0
he had worked for aid agencies in @entity120 , @entity121 , and the former @entity122			0
@entity123 , spokesman for @entity112 , said he was hired for his experience working in war zones : ‘ he had only been employed by us for ten days when he went missing			1
@entity8 went to @entity5 to help @entity5 , to help the vulnerable			1
’ the disclosure that @entity8 , 44 , has been suffering physical difficulties alongside inevitable mental turmoil must have added to the distress of his wife @entity25 ( pictured on their wedding day ) , who lives in @entity49 he was kidnapped by an @entity137 gang with @entity138 , an @entity140 - @entity139 aid worker freed four months ago after a ransom was paid			1
a @entity5 intermediary said $ 4 million ( £ 2.5 million ) was handed over by @entity140 officials after lengthy negotiations involving intelligence agencies			2
the country ’s foreign minister admitted there had been ‘ complex and delicate ’ work to get @entity138 freed			2
exactly the same sum was paid by the @entity140 authorities last september to free a journalist held by a rogue brigade of the @entity154 ( @entity154 )			0
@entity155 is working to secure the release of two young female aid workers , thought to have been abducted by a criminal gang , with officials currently on the @entity116 border			1
according to a security source , £ 31.7 million has been paid over the past 12 months by @entity163 governments , families and insurers to free aid workers and reporters			1
@entity168 rounded on fellow world leaders at the @entity170 last week , urging them not to given in to ransom demands			0
‘ it is utterly self - defeating , ’ he said			2
but a friend of @entity174 yesterday criticised the @entity1 authorities for refusing to pay ransoms : ‘ if he was from @entity140 or @entity113 they would pay and he would be back with his beautiful wife and their child			1
the @entity1 and @entity82 wo n’t pay ransoms so they are letting an innocent man die			2
’ in a separate case , a @entity116 journalist has revealed one of his captors was a young white @entity88 - speaker , almost certainly from @entity1			1
although there are thought to be some 500 militants from this country in @entity5 and @entity78 , those known about have been almost exclusively from ethnic minority backgrounds			2
a friend of his wife @entity25 , the mother of his child @entity26 , has criticised the @entity1 government for not paying ransoms for the return of hostages the brown - eyed militant was aged about 24 , of slight build , 5ft 6in tall and growing a wispy beard			2
he was guarding @entity204 , a photojournalist seized last november while investigating massacres in @entity206 said the @entity88 - speaking jihadi demanded his computer and social media passwords and ‘ kept asking if i was working for the @entity211 or @entity212 ’			1
he could not be completely certain the man was @entity1 , ‘ but it was definitely not @entity82 - @entity88 , ’ he said , adding that , unusually , this guard never spoke in @entity216			1
others spoke sometimes in broken @entity88			2
@entity204 , captured for 40 days before being freed by a rival militia working with @entity116 intelligence agency @entity219 , is the first foreign journalist to speak openly about being held hostage by @entity80 fanatics			1
he endured endless interrogations and was sentenced to death at one point			0
‘ it was the worst feeling of despair you can have to know you are going to your death , ’ he said			2
he was moved every four days , usually in the boot of a car , and held hooded and handcuffed in basements , houses and ‘ a metal enclosure ’			2
militants in black balaclavas bombarded him with questions , asking him if he was spy , making him pray five times a day and mocking him because his name reminded them of @entity242 prime minister @entity241			0
@entity204 was seized with a commander of the @entity154 in the town of @entity245 by @entity80 fighters			2
in his first prison , a fellow @entity5 hostage warned him : ‘ tell them the truth			1
you ’re not even worth the value of a chicken to them			0
’ his worst moment came three days later when four fighters gave him a copy of the @entity258 and warned he had been sentenced to death			0
‘ you @entity116 are @entity261 , not proper @entity262 , so we are going to execute you , ’ they said			2
the man who told him was a turk who had spent ten years fighting with @entity264 in @entity265			0
‘ i was paralysed with fear , ’ @entity204 said			0
‘ i needed to find a way to be shot rather than beheaded			0
’ he was forced to wait two days for his death , the lowest point in his ordeal			0
but on the day his execution was due , none of his captors turned up			0
they finally arrived bearing the body of the @entity116 fighter , who had been shot in battle			0
the aid worker had been employed by his @entity113 charity for just ten days when seized in northern @entity5 within sight of the @entity116 border the militants – who included @entity116 from @entity283 – asked him if he wanted to smell his fellow @entity263 ’s blood			1
‘ the blood of martyrs smells good , ’ they said			0
after 17 days in captivity his kidnappers decided @entity204 was telling the truth and stopped the barrage of questions			0
for his final few days he was held with some @entity5			2
he said this move was influenced by stories in the @entity116 media , which confirmed he was a journalist and not a spy			0
‘ they follow reports on the internet very closely			0
’ as a result he believes media ‘ blackouts ’ – as requested by the @entity306 – can backfire , while pointing out they also relieve pressure on officials to save those being held			0
the @entity307 has revealed @entity1 has paid £ 500,000 to a security agency based in a secret @entity110 location to bring war crimes charges against leaders of @entity80 using information smuggled out of the organisation			1
a spokesman told @entity43 : ‘ the @entity1 has a long - standing commitment to ensuring that those responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity in @entity5 are held to account			1
as part of that we are funding the investigation of atrocities carried out by @entity324			0
’ meanwhile , family and friends of mr @entity8 are rallying around his 17 - year - old daughter @entity327 , comforting her with long walks in the @entity330 countryside near where she lives with @entity8 ’s first wife in @entity333			1
one close family friend said : ‘ it ’s been very difficult for them			0
‘ they are a very close family – that is how they are getting through this			0
’ @entity342 referred to the terrifying situation facing her father with a series of heartbreaking messages on social media			0
she described him as ‘ my hero ’ and said she would do anything to have him ‘ home for good ’			0
