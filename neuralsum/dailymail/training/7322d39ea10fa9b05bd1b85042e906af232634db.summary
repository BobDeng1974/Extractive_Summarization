as he worked the room at a swanky cocktail party for the great and the good in @entity4 over the weekend , prince @entity0 was handed a glass of @entity6 ’s by a waiter			1
eyeing his drink , a smiling @entity0 innocently told a fellow guest : ‘ i did n’t realise you had @entity6 ’s in @entity11			1
’ quick as a flash , his principal private secretary , @entity12 , moved in and spirited the glass away			0
it was a telling vignette			0
having a ball : prince @entity0 plays volleyball at the opening of the @entity19 in @entity20 down and out : @entity0 was playing for the @entity21 against an @entity11 team grinning and winning : @entity0 's easy laughter has wowed @entity11 with those naked pictures of @entity0 in @entity26 – taken during a drunken game of strip billiards – still fresh in the memory , courtiers are anxious that he jettisons his ‘ party prince ’ image on his current week - long official tour of @entity11			1
being photographed clutching a glass of alcohol does not sit well with this picture of the new , mature @entity0			2
no wonder , perhaps , one stateside newspaper has cheekily christened the trip ‘ @entity39 ’			0
in truth , however , @entity0 seems to be doing a perfectly good job of charming the pants off @entity11 without the help of his royal image - makers			1
already , the 28 - year - old prince has managed to turn first lady @entity46 – who @entity0 privately describes as ‘ a very cool lady ’ – into something resembling a giggling teenager during a hugely successful visit to the @entity51			2
meanwhile , amid scenes of pop star - like hysteria , the world ’s most eligible bachelor was greeted by 500 screaming girls when he paid a visit to the @entity59 in @entity60 for an event to publicise the @entity62 , the landmine charity supported by his late mother @entity64			0
the prince has also won many admirers across the pond for his quiet dignity during a sombre wreath - laying ceremony at the @entity72 military cemetery			0
home turf : prince @entity0 said he would like to see the @entity19 come to @entity21 sell - out : the young royal believes the @entity19 would fill an 80,000 capacity stadium he was similarly impressive as , in his combat fatigues , he displayed the genuine empathy and warmth that comes so naturally to him when meeting severely injured servicemen at a rehabilitation centre in @entity81			1
later , he gamely got stuck in during a game of volleyball with wounded soldiers at the @entity19 , a sports event for injured servicemen in @entity20			1
prince @entity0 found himself sitting on the floor during the match , before being chased @entity89 - style round the court by @entity11 @entity93 - winning beach volleyballer @entity91			1
@entity95 medic @entity94 , 26 , who was injured in @entity96 in 2007 , said : ‘ it was a good first effort , but it would have been better if he had stayed on his bum for longer			0
caring : prince @entity0 displayed genuine empathy for the wounded soldiers he met ‘ it would be great if he could take it up as a sport			1
’ @entity0 called for the @entity19 to be brought to @entity21 and said he could n’t think of a better use for the @entity105 in @entity106			1
he said : ‘ i only hope in the future , the near future , we can bring the @entity19 to @entity21 and continue to enlarge this fantastic cause			1
‘ i do n’t see how it would n’t be possible to fill a stadium with 80,000 people , not to watch @entity114 , not to watch @entity115 , but to watch wounded servicemen fight it out amongst each other – not on a battlefield but in a stadium			2
’ tomorrow , @entity0 is due to ride into @entity121 on an iconic @entity106 bus to plug a @entity21 government drive to promote @entity21 as a place to live , work and , above all , invest in			1
and a planned polo match featuring @entity0 this wednesday in wealthy @entity127 , @entity128 – hosted by billionaire @entity129 and his supermodel wife @entity130 in aid of the prince ’s @entity133 charity – has become the hottest ticket for years			1
all in all , @entity136 has well and truly hit the @entity137			2
and suddenly his rather childish high - jinks at his £ 5,000 - a - night suite in @entity140 last summer seem a long time ago			0
could it be that @entity0 , who had teenage brushes with cannabis , brawls with photographers outside nightclubs and once donned a @entity147 outfit for a fancy dress party , is finally growing up ? if so , the transformation could hardly come at a more welcome time with the @entity152 ’s recent announcement that she is scaling back on commitments that involve long - haul travel			2
privately , @entity155 helicopter pilot @entity0 says he expects increasingly to fill his grandmother ’s shoes on official trips to foreign shores , though he is adamant he will keep ‘ one foot in the @entity160 and one foot in the royal world ’			2
sir @entity162 , the @entity21 ambassador to the @entity11 , speaks glowingly about @entity0 ’s maturity and the way he has stepped up to the job this week			1
and the simple truth is that others in the @entity168 , including his brother @entity169 , can only look on with admiration and , occasionally , envy at the apparently effortless way @entity0 wows everyone from maimed soldiers to titans of big business			2
serious competition : prince @entity0 was dressed in a @entity21 uniform as he took on the @entity11 team stiff competition : prince @entity0 was playing against @entity11 gold medallist @entity181 - @entity91 the only lingering question is whether @entity0 ’s self - destructive impulses will trip him up again			1
certainly , the five - strong team travelling with him on this long - planned trip are rubbing their hands together in glee at its unalloyed success thus far , but there is still the unspoken fear that @entity0 is never far away from another mishap			2
significantly , although @entity0 publicly professed he let his family down over the naked pictures furore last august , he remains privately unrepentant , complaining that he sees no tension between his growing official role and his insistence on letting his hair down once he is off - duty			2
and even as he approaches his 30th birthday next year , @entity0 remains prone to occasional outbursts of petulance that do not sit well with the more mature image his advisers are seeking to foster			0
a rather ill - tempered television interview after he arrived back from a 20 - week tour of duty in @entity96 in january , in which he moaned that he never wanted to give up being a foot soldier on patrol to fly helicopters , and complained he was ‘ gawped ’ at by fellow soldiers during mealtimes at @entity211 , made him sound spoilt			0
he also ill - advisedly let slip that he had killed @entity213 fighters in his role as a helicopter gunner , raising fears among his advisers that this could make him a terrorist target			0
room for improvement : @entity95 medic @entity94 said the royal needs to stay ' on his bum for longer ' wowing the crowds : prince @entity0 has gained praise for his ease at talking to injured military and business leaders publicity : prince @entity0 is promoting his charities during his tour but increasingly , he is keen to display a more thoughtful image			1
@entity0 even proved himself to be a chip off the old block by upbraiding the female chief executive of a renewable energy company at a drinks reception hosted by the @entity21 consul in @entity4 last week over the ‘ visual impact ’ of wind farms – a subject long close to the heart of his father @entity242 , who once branded them ‘ a horrendous blot on the landscape ’			1
this trip has been facilitated by @entity0 ’s aide @entity12 , who has spent months planning the tour with the help of sir @entity249 , the former @entity21 ambassador to the @entity11 , who acts as the @entity0 ’s unpaid adviser on foreign matters after the @entity152 asked him to throw a protective arm around her errant grandson			1
but the trip was very much @entity0 ’s idea			0
it is something of a swansong for @entity12 , a quietly intense man with an occasionally @entity259 sense of humour , who is quitting the post to return to work in the private sector and to spend more time with his four young children at home in @entity267			0
the highly decorated former @entity269 soldier will be a sad loss to @entity0 who views @entity12 as sort of father - confessor			0
joining @entity0 in @entity11 this week is @entity12 ’s replacement as his private secretary , @entity276 , a former officer in the @entity278 and @entity279 who is a distant relative of baroness @entity281 , the internet businesswoman ; and @entity0 ’s new press secretary , @entity282 , who hitherto had the unenviable job as pr man to the gaffe - prone prince @entity285			1
quite patently @entity0 is a much easier sell than his uncle			0
indeed , his polished performance in the @entity137 has helped dispel fears , once expressed by senior members of the royal household , that he was going down the ‘ prince @entity285 route ’ and risked being seen as a rather pointless ‘ spare ’ to his brother ’s ‘ heir ’			0
certainly , this is just the sort of trip , which is partly about boosting @entity21 business and investment , that would have gone completely ignored if it had been @entity285 rather than @entity0 pressing the flesh			2
high five : prince @entity0 met @entity304 and @entity21 soldiers competing in the @entity19 having a laugh : prince @entity0 was relaxed among fellow armed forces veterans and for all his impetuousness , @entity0 , who is dating dance student @entity308 , is undoubtedly a breath of fresh air when set against the usual starched formality of the royals on tour			1
by way of illustrating the point , he is travelling without a valet or equerry and is getting his own clothes ready for his busy list of official functions in @entity11 ( something his father or , for that matter , @entity285 , would find unthinkable )			0
and he flew across the @entity325 on a commercial flight , albeit in the @entity328 section of a @entity330 jet			0
even so , alongside the genuinely warm welcome he has received across the pond , there are cynical voices in the @entity11 media who think the new , responsible @entity0 is rather too good to be true			2
the @entity337 sniffily asked its readers : ‘ can @entity0 really clean up his image ? ’ he has also unfairly come in for flak for supposedly using his planned visit to victims of @entity343 in @entity344 tomorrow as a pr ploy			0
‘ prince @entity0 has quite an agenda to clean up his act , ’ says @entity347 rebranding expert @entity346			1
‘ but the @entity11 is the global thermometer of what ’s in and what ’s out			0
if the @entity11 love him and can forgive him , then hopefully everyone else will too			0
’ the only question now for the new responsible @entity0 is whether he can ride this wave of popularity without shooting himself in the foot again .			0
