by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 13:59 est , 9 august 2012 updated : 14:16 est , 9 august 2012 a @entity3 prosecutor hoping to convict @entity4 of murder in the @entity7 shooting made a humiliating blunder when her office released a photo of the teen 's body			1
the documents were released today by the office of special prosecutor @entity15 in the case of @entity4 , who has been charged with second - degree murder in @entity7 ’s february 26 death			1
but among the pages of evidence was a photo of @entity7 taken right after his death , as well as @entity4 ’s college records - which were supposed to be kept confidential			1
the files revealed that officers found @entity7 ’s blood on a bag of @entity43 in his pocket , and emails from the @entity47 , the @entity45 reported			1
the records from @entity31 revealed that @entity4 had been placed on academic probation in 2011 for failing to keep his grade point average above 2.0			2
they also said that @entity4 had been granted an administrative withdrawal about a month after the shooting			0
meanwhile , @entity4 will seek to have second - degree murder charges dismissed under @entity3 's ' stand your ground ' law in the shooting death of 17 - year - old @entity7 , his attorney said thursday			1
appeal : last month , @entity4 posted a nearly - 2 minute , bilingual video thanking fans for their support the hearing , which likely wo n't take place for several months , will amount to a mini-trial involving much of the evidence collected by prosecutors as well as expert testimony from both sides			0
although the posting did not say so , legal experts say it 's likely that @entity4 himself would testify since he is the sole survivor of the february 26 confrontation			0
" most of the arguments , witnesses , experts and evidence that the defence would muster in a criminal trial will be presented in the ' stand your ground ' hearing , ' said the statement posted on @entity4 's official defence website			2
under the law , circuit judge @entity86 can dismiss the charges if @entity4 conclusively shows he fatally shot @entity7 because he ' reasonably believed ' he might be killed or suffer ' great bodily harm ' at the hands of the unarmed teenager			0
legal battle : @entity4 , pictured right at an april 20 bond hearing , will fight the charges against him using @entity3 's ' stand your ground ' law killed : @entity7 was shot and killed the night of february 26 in @entity28 , @entity3 , by @entity4 the law also says a person has no duty to retreat in the face of such a threat			1
@entity4 , a neighborhood watch volunteer , shot @entity7 after a confrontation in @entity4 's gated community in the central @entity3 town of @entity28 , where @entity7 was visiting			1
the case drew local and nationwide protests because @entity4 was not arrested for weeks after the shooting			0
evidence released by prosecutors , the @entity4 statement said , shows ' clear support for a strong claim of self - defense			2
' the statement added that @entity4 attorney @entity118 ' urges everyone to be patient during this process and to reserve judgment until the evidence is presented in the ` stand your ground ' hearing			0
' defence : @entity4 is represented by attorney @entity118 , centre , seen walking to the @entity128 @entity7 's parents have contended that @entity4 singled out their son as he was returning from a convenience store because he was black and that it was @entity4 's aggression that led to his death			1
@entity4 , who is free on $ 1million bail , faces a possible life prison sentence if convicted of second - degree murder			1
if his ' stand your ground ' claim succeeds , however , the criminal charges would be dismissed and @entity4 could not be held liable in any civil action such as a wrongful death lawsuit			0
prosecutors would likely appeal a successful self - defence claim			0
a spokeswoman for special prosecutor @entity15 declined comment			0
an attorney for @entity7 's parents did not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment			2
evidence : @entity4 has said that @entity7 broke his nose and slammed his head into the pavement , which corroborate with the @entity47 's photos from that night legal experts have said that @entity4 's credibility is a key to his claim and that he undermined his own cause by deceiving the judge about his finances during an april bond hearing			1
that alleged deception led to perjury charges against @entity4 's wife , @entity165			2
she has pleaded not guilty			0
@entity86 , who will also decide the self - defence claim , said @entity4 ' flaunted the system ' by making misleading statements about how much money the couple had raised through online contributions from supporters			0
the judge revoked @entity4 's initial $ 150,000 bond and had him returned to jail , then allowed him to be released on the higher $ 1million figure with additional restrictions			1
opening up : @entity4 spoke publicly for the first time in an interview with @entity182 ' @entity181 last month watch video here			0
