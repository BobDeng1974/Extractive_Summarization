@entity25 : @entity32 ( 4 ) referee : @entity52 ( @entity53 ) @entity0 foiled @entity26 's bid to win an historic 18th consecutive test as the @entity57 rivals played out a 12 - 12 stalemate at the @entity59			1
@entity62 's @entity61 holders were heavy favourites to book their place in the history books and get their @entity66 campaign started with a win , but @entity0 maintained their recent resurgence to spoil the party			0
under coach @entity70 the @entity0 were chasing an eighth consecutive win of their own and , although they rode their luck at times , they put consistent pressure on the @entity26 in slippery conditions			2
@entity6 , given the nod at fly - half for the hosts , and @entity32 kicked four penalties apiece to set up a tasty return clash next week			1
things looked very different early on when the @entity0 , boasting seven players from @entity84 champions the @entity85 in their starting xv , were pushed on to the back foot almost immediately			0
it was hardly surprising when the early pressure led to a penalty and @entity13 was the guilty party at the breakdown as @entity32 , who continued at fly - half despite calls for @entity49 to start , slotted home to give the visitors a 3 - 0 lead after four minutes			0
level best : @entity32 's four penalties had the @entity26 in the lead for the majority of the game tough tackling : on a damp day there were plenty of big hits but not much running rugby it could have been even worse for the @entity0 soon after as @entity106 pounced on a spill from @entity6 , but in greasy conditions @entity35 fumbled his offload just short of the line			1
@entity6 kicked over a penalty of his own after a rare foray forward by the @entity0 , but @entity32 then restored the @entity26 ' three - point cushion before splitting the posts again to make it 9 - 3 as @entity0 's scrum began to creak			1
the maverick nature of @entity6 inspired a late first - half flurry from the hosts and a series of frenzied phases led to prop @entity34 being sent to the sin bin for repeated @entity26 infringing at the breakdown			0
@entity6 played for territory as the @entity0 pushed for a try , but he then hit the post with a subsequent penalty attempt as the visitors just about kept their six - point lead at the break			0
friendly fire : @entity7 and @entity1 clash heads during the first half , leaving @entity1 with a bloodied nose intensity : the @entity26 dominated the first half after a rousing @entity135 in @entity136 @entity137 hit : @entity40 stops @entity6 , but the @entity26 were eventually undone by indiscipline the @entity85 man did reduce the arrears to three shortly before @entity34 returned in the second - half , and he and @entity32 then traded penalties to make it 12 - 9 on the hour - mark			1
with 10 minutes left on the clock the momentum switched to the @entity0 and , with substitute @entity49 sent to the bin for a professional foul , @entity6 kicked his side level with his final act of the day before being replaced by club team - mate @entity24			2
although the 14 - men @entity26 desperately tried to find a way to get the win in the closing stages it was @entity0 , who have not won the @entity57 since 2002 , fell just short of nicking it at the end themselves .			2

*honours* even in opening @entity163 encounter
@entity0 foiled @entity26 's bid to win an historic 18th consecutive test
@entity6 and @entity32 kicked four penalties apiece
