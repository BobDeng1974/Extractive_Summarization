so , after today 's results , @entity15 will travel to the @entity31 to take on @entity19 next sunday in a game which will see the winner take all ! @entity15 currently lead the @entity27 giants by three points			1
however , should @entity45 beat @entity23 's side , the @entity5 title will go to @entity19 thanks to the head - to - head rule			1
what an epic match that will be ! @entity7 are out of the title race after losing 2 - 0 to @entity8			1
it is now a two - horse race going into the final game of the season ! @entity15 fail to score that all important goal and so go into that final game of the season knowing they will be crowned @entity5 champions so long as they avoid defeat to @entity19			1
easier said than done ! another brilliant save by @entity60 denies @entity61 who had cut in from the left and launched a ferocious shot at goal only to be denied by the @entity16 stopper			2
what a match ! @entity21 fans celebrate wildly after drawing with @entity19			1
@entity15 can win the title with a late goal ! @entity70 stepped up to take the free - kick which resulted from @entity73 's challenge but curled his effort just wide of the post			1
former @entity76 defender @entity73 brings down @entity23 just outside the area and receives a second yellow card			0
slightly harsh , that one			0
@entity19 finally bring @entity79 on for @entity80			2
@entity81 : things get heated as substitute @entity83 rows with @entity84			0
the only people @entity7 should be angry with are themselves			2
youngster @entity86 comes on for @entity87 and that 's @entity13 's third sub , so @entity90 will remain on the bench			1
it 's all about the @entity93 now			1
fans from all three clubs , put particularly @entity30 supporters , listen nervously to see what 's going on in their rivals matches			0
should @entity15 find a winner with just over tne minutes to go and @entity19 remain goalless then @entity23 's men will be crowned @entity5 champions with a game to go ! @entity5 - as it stands 1			1
@entity7 84 @entity103 : @entity19 manager @entity104 keeps looking at his watch as the players on the bench warm up			1
@entity19 need to make a change here with @entity79 the possible answer			2
@entity112 international @entity111 heads @entity15 level with his first - ever @entity5 goal ! signed from @entity116 in the summer , the centre back was unmarked and headed home from a corner			1
@entity15 are back level ! with both @entity7 clubs currently losing this is how the @entity5 table currently looks ... 1			1
@entity7 84 @entity121 is replaced by @entity23			2
will the @entity123 's magic unlock the @entity16 backline ? @entity15 go behind as @entity125 puts @entity16 ahead ! @entity126 nips in to dispossesses @entity127 before heading home the looping ball past @entity130			1
the title race has taken another turn ! @entity81 : another disgraceful goal for @entity7 to conceed , and that 's @entity11 ' second of the game			1
@entity135 played a suicidal ball back towards @entity137 , @entity11 easily intercepted it and rolled home			0
more fresh legs for the home side as @entity141 @entity70 comes on for @entity126			0
@entity81 : @entity7 have come out with much more purpose in the second half			2
@entity144 went close and @entity145 nearly made amends but had a header ruled out for offside			0
@entity15 goalkeeper @entity130 races out of his box to deny @entity16 striker @entity151			1
brilliant play the young stopper , former @entity155 and @entity156 frontman @entity153 looked to be clean though on goal and perhaps should have done better			0
@entity158 is replaced by @entity137			0
@entity159 receives the ball at the back post and shoots towards goal but @entity16 goalkeeper @entity163 gets his angles spot on to tip the effort over for an @entity15 corner which , after a brief scramble , @entity16 clear			1
@entity169 receives a yellow card for time - wasting after taking an age to take a throw - in with 39 minutes still to play			0
@entity16 , five points above the drop , are themselves desperate for the points as they bid to climb away from the relegation zone			2
@entity15 goalkeeper @entity130 , celebrating his 22nd birthday today , has had nothing to do so far in this game			2
however , it remains 0 - 0			0
we 're back underway for the second period			0
as it stands ... 1			0
@entity7 84 real are currently out of the title race as they trail 1 - 0 to @entity8			1
meanwhile @entity15 and @entity19 remain goalless against @entity16 and @entity21 , respectively			1
real have to win tonight to stand any chance of catching their local rivals but are behind against @entity8			2
@entity7 84 @entity81 : @entity7 have been pathetic so far and that goal sums up their display			2
@entity145 was wandering on the edge of his own box and was robbed by @entity11 , who rounded @entity197 and smashed home with aplomb			0
@entity126 leaps highest to get his head to the ball in the opposition area but can only direct the ball wide			0
@entity15 are really pushing for an opener but perhaps nerves are getting to them a little ... @entity158 gets on the end of @entity210 's cross from the right but drags his effort wide			2
@entity81 : the closest we 've come so far is a header from @entity11 after 30 minutes , getting on the end of a scooped ball into the box but nodding over the crossbar			0
@entity121 is correctly yellow carded for going down far too easily in the box			0
the @entity221 midfielder went down theatrically depsite the fact @entity16 's @entity223 did n't appear to touch him			2
no place for that in football			0
that was scandalous ! with no goals to report on so far the top of @entity5 currently looks like this ... 1			0
@entity7 85 @entity232 dribbles past the @entity21 defence and fires a shot at goal but his effort is deflected and goes out for a corner which comes to nothing			1
@entity81 : still a soporific affair at @entity240 and @entity8 have shaded the game			2
@entity242 looking a little lost up front for @entity7 , with usual hitman @entity244 absent through injury			0
@entity246 , @entity247 , @entity248 , @entity249 , @entity250 , @entity251 , @entity80 , @entity252 , @entity232 , @entity253 , @entity254			0
@entity130 , @entity210 , @entity255 , @entity256 , @entity127 , @entity111 , @entity158 , @entity257 , @entity159 , @entity126 , @entity121			0
@entity81 : @entity7 have all but given up on @entity5 , playing a heavily rotated side against @entity8 today			1
@entity259 plays his first game for six months , returning after injury			0
@entity7 : @entity197 , @entity145 , @entity259 , @entity262 , @entity135 , @entity87 , @entity263 , @entity264 , @entity265 , @entity242 , @entity266			0
we 're ten minutes in and all three games remain goalless .			0

@entity15 could have won title with win over @entity16
@entity7 defeat to @entity8 means @entity13 's side are out of title race
@entity19 draw away to @entity21 and sit three points behind leaders @entity15
@entity45 will win @entity93 with *victory* over @entity281 to head - to - head rule
