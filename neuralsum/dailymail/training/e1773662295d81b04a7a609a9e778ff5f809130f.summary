it was not immediately clear how many more forces @entity0 would send in and what role they would play			0
the @entity13 military has already launched targeted strikes against the group 's positions in @entity15 , but has yet to strike at their strongholds in @entity3 , where the extremists are also fighting soldiers from the regime of @entity3 president @entity60			1
@entity0 told congressional leaders on tuesday that he has the authority he needs to broaden his military campaign into @entity3 , striking @entity2 in its stronghold despite objections from @entity60			1

he also plans to pledge @entity13 troops to training and equipping moderate elements of the @entity60 's @entity78 opposition			0
` hours before @entity0 met with senior @entity80 leaders , former vice president @entity81 told @entity84 @entity83 stalwarts in the @entity85 that they need to stand strong in the age of @entity2 against the @entity0 administration 's efforts to pare back military spending			1
@entity81 reportedly blamed @entity0 's isolationist tendencies forcefully for the rise of @entity78 extremism , particularly @entity2 's rush to fill a power vacuum left when @entity0 pulled @entity13 troops out of @entity15			1
the @entity96 reported that a meeting attendee said @entity81 warned ' how unprepared the @entity13 military is for any kind of medium - or large - scale engagement against @entity2 because the administration is cutting the military so much			1
' as the pendulum swings back toward more military action in @entity15 , a senior administration official confirmed to the @entity107 fresh airstrikes will be a prominent feature of @entity0 's nascent strategy			1
the package could also include a $ 500 million fund to arm @entity3 rebels groups in their fight against @entity2 , which was suggested earlier this year but has yet to be approved			1

@entity32 will urge newly - installed @entity41 to unite the rival factions in his country - as well as offering @entity13 help to tackle @entity2			2
in his 9:00 p.m. address , @entity0 will challenge @entity120 to quickly give him authority to arm moderate @entity3 opposition forces fighting @entity60			1
but administration officials said he will press forward with other elements of his plan without formal authorization from lawmakers			0
those include increased support for @entity15 security forces , as well as military and diplomatic commitments from partners in @entity132 , the @entity7 and elsewhere			0
@entity0 sent a memorandum to @entity32 on wednesday afternoon directing him to set aside $ 25 million for ' immediate military assistance ' for the @entity15 government and @entity137 forces			1

the @entity0 administration has said that @entity2 will not be defeated by military action alone			2
@entity32 said after the meeting he was impressed by the premier 's plans to rebuild the @entity15 military and push broad political reforms after an hour of discussion with congressional leaders yesterday , @entity0 told lawmakers that he ' has the authority he needs to take action ' against @entity2			1
the @entity84 added that the president still would welcome action from @entity120 that would ' aid the overall effort and demonstrate to the world that the @entity13 is united in defeating the threat			2
' among the president 's most urgent priorities will be seeking authorization from @entity120 to arm more moderate elements of the @entity3 opposition fighting @entity60			1

@entity13 who are worried about security threats far outnumber those who think that the @entity13 is more safe than it was after the nation attacked by @entity180 or just as safe			0
the @entity183 / @entity182 poll found that 47 percent of @entity13 said they felt less safe than before compared to the 26 percent who said they felt more safe			0
another 26 percent reported no change in the perception of their safety			0
a majority , 61 percent , also expressed support for military action against @entity194 extremists in @entity15 and @entity3 who some lawmakers believe may be targeting the @entity13 for an attack			2
@entity0 and @entity197 spent wednesday afternoon calling lawmakers to make a last - minute plea for them to add the measure to a continuing resolution to keep the government open that they intend to debate on thursday			2
@entity204 chairman @entity203 , who was one of the members on the receiving end of a call from the president , said he was n't in favor of introducing a new element into the government funding debate so late in the process			0
' they 've known about this problem for over a year , ' @entity203 told @entity215			0
' it 's a complicated , big - time change in policy ... let us go ahead with a @entity219 to keep the government going			0
' still , @entity84 majority leader @entity221 said wednesday that the legislative body would postpone a vote on the resolution until next week			0
@entity84 minority leader @entity225 argued that authorization for the military effort should be ' on whatever engine is leaving the station , and that 's one that is leaving the station			0
' that 's for sure a must - pass bill in a [ short window ] of time , and i would hope that it would be on there , ' she said on wednesday			0
the @entity13 is already running a small - scaled @entity241 scheme to train rebels , but @entity0 is hoping for approval for a more overt military effort that could involve staging training locations in countries near @entity3			1
with @entity0 ruling out sending @entity13 ground troops into combat in @entity15 or @entity3 , bolstering the capacity of the @entity15 security forces and @entity3 opposition will be crucial to efforts to root out the @entity254 militant group			1
administration officials said @entity0 also sees a congressional approval for a the training scheme as a way to send a strong signal to allies considering similar efforts			0
secretary of state @entity32 traveled to the @entity7 on wednesday for discussions in @entity264 and @entity265			0
on @entity80 , there was little consensus on the scope of @entity0 's authority to broaden the campaign against the @entity254 extremists			2
while some lawmakers said the president has the power he needs under the @entity276 , others were seeking a more central congressional role in the effort			0
warmongers : @entity2 has seized huge amounts of territory in @entity15 and @entity3			2
they are pictured above in a position won from the @entity15 government 's army ' i think it is to his advantage and the country 's advantage to have @entity120 buy into that , ' senate minority leader @entity286 , @entity287 , said before joining other @entity83 and @entity295 leaders in the @entity296 on tuesday for a meeting with @entity0			1
none of the leaders spoke to reporters as they left the @entity84			0
however , an aide to house speaker @entity30 said the @entity302 @entity83 expressed support for efforts to increase the effectiveness of the @entity15 security forces and for equipping the @entity3 opposition			2
@entity30 also said he would support the deployment of @entity13 military personnel to @entity15 in a training and advisory role and to ' assist with lethal targeting ' of @entity2 , according to the aide , who spoke only on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the private meeting by name			2
the @entity13 is already launching airstrikes against @entity254 targets inside @entity15 , a mission undertaken at the invitation of the @entity15 government and without formal authorization from @entity120			1
but the scope of the mission has been limited to strikes that help protect @entity13 interests in the region and prevent humanitarian crises			0
@entity13 officials said @entity0 was expected to loosen those limitations and open a broader counterterrorism campaign against the militants in @entity15			1
following the @entity333 's shocking beheading of two @entity13 journalists in @entity3 , @entity0 began more seriously considering extending strikes into that country			1
people who have spoken with @entity0 in recent days said it appeared likely he would take that step			0
at a private dinner monday with foreign policy experts , @entity0 emphasized the importance of viewing the @entity254 as one organisation , not two groups separated by a border			0
fighters : pictured above are members of the @entity137 @entity348 military fighting @entity2 @entity0 's spokesman has said the president is willing ' to go wherever is necessary to strike those who are threatening @entity13			1
' however , @entity0 has continued to rule out sending @entity13 troops into ground combat operations in the @entity7			2
unlike in @entity15 , @entity0 would not be acting at the invitation of a host government			0
however , some international law experts say airstrikes could be justified as a matter of self - defense if @entity0 argues the @entity254 group poses a threat to the @entity13 and its allies from inside @entity3 , whose government is unwilling or unable to stop it .			1

@entity0 will announce a long - awaited strategy in an address to the nation wednesday night
