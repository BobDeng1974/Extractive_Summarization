@entity0 has admitted there are still places up for grabs in his @entity4 team for sunday 's @entity6 showdown with @entity7			1
the 63 - year - old @entity4 boss has spent the last week keeping his fingers crossed over a series of injury doubts , all the while considering options to plug potential gaps in his starting line - up			1
@entity16 midfielder @entity15 , who would have been in contention for sunday 's qualifier at the @entity19 , has already returned to his club after admitting defeat in his battle against a groin problem , although @entity0 received better news on friday when full - back @entity25 and winger @entity27 were both able to train in @entity28			1
@entity0 has admitted there are still places up for grabs in his @entity4 team @entity4 's @entity31 and @entity32 during the training session at @entity34 however , the team will not be named until the day of the game , and that means there is still time for men to force their way into his plans			1
@entity0 said : ' i think there are positions up for grabs , like there have always been since i have come here , and i think any international manager would probably tell you exactly the same			1
' he 's got an idea that he can formulate a couple of weeks beforehand , but the first time that you really consider it is when you have players at your disposal for the week of the game			2
' of course , we have had one or two players who for one reason or another , generally through injury , have n't really been available for the start of the week , so then you have to formulate different ideas , different plans for the players that you think might participate in the game			2
' but overall , there have always been positions up for grabs here			0
' @entity25 and @entity27 have both been struggling with ankle problems and while the @entity73 winger has been a regular member of the starting @entity74 under @entity0 , it is perhaps the absence of @entity76 left - back @entity25 which would cause him the greater consternation			1
@entity79 can and has played at full - back , although has more recently been employed as a central defender by his country , while @entity83 is also left - sided and could play in both positions			0
goalkeeper @entity85 ( right ) trains alongside fellow stopper @entity87 @entity4 player @entity88 talks to the media during training ahead of the @entity7 clash however , there is a school of thought which suggests that any vacancy on the left side of the back four could be filled by @entity99 winger @entity98 , who has operated there in the past for both club and country			1
indeed , he scored twice from that position in november 's 4 - 1 friendly victory over the @entity107 in @entity108 , and that has not been lost on his manager			1
@entity0 said : ' he did very well , really well , scored two goals and from that position on the field , was really excellent			2
' however , @entity25 's fitness - he has suffered some irritation from screws used to repair his fractured ankle - and readiness to play will be fully assessed before a final decision is taken			0
@entity0 said : ' i 'll have a word with him now and see how he feels			2
this was the first bit of work that he 's done , but we 'll see			0
' fitness is very , very important , but sometimes players can get through on adrenaline			0
you would n't want to be going in with four or five players not having done that much , but @entity25 knows himself now			0
if he thinks he can make it , well that 's good news for us			0
' @entity27 limped out of training on tuesday ahead of @entity4 's @entity6 clash with @entity7 @entity4 assistant manager @entity138 in action as his side prepare for the @entity141 leaders @entity7 currently lead @entity141 by three points from @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 , and while @entity0 does not necessarily view sunday 's encounter as a must - win affair , he knows the impetus a victory would give his side			1
he said : ' naturally , we are at home and the onus is on us to try to get forward and try to win the game , and that 's what we are going to try to do			0
' but there are a number of games left in the competition			0
you mentioned the top two places [ qualify ] automatically - it 's a tough old group we are in , but we are going for it			0
' celebrations of @entity4 's @entity165 victory last weekend are still very much ongoing , and @entity0 is hoping to take a little of that into the game			1
he said : ' the @entity169 rugby team has done fantastically well and maybe we could take something from that			2
they have given us a lead , let 's go and try to continue that			0
