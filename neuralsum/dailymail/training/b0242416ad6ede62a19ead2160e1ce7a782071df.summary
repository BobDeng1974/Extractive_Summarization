owners of lawnmowers , mobility scooters and golf buggies may have to take out motor insurance under a new @entity6 directive			0
it follows a ruling from the @entity9 that an accident involving a tractor trailer on private land should have been covered by compulsory insurance			1
cover must now be obtained for ‘ any motor vehicle intended for travel on land and propelled by mechanical power ’			0
dangerous : @entity20 , 46 , council gardener mows the grass on a ride - on lawnmower , which is just one of the kinds of vehicles that may now have to be covered by motor insurance under a new @entity6 directive @entity29 ministers are worried the directive could even apply to ride - on lawnmowers because the definition of motor vehicles is so unclear			2
there is also concern that insurance costs could rise for all drivers			0
the ruling comes following a @entity38 legal case involving a @entity39 , @entity40			1
he was hurt after falling from a ladder when it was hit by a reversing tractor trailer			1
because it involved a vehicle being used as an ‘ agricultural machine ’ and took place on private property , motor insurers refused to cover the claim			0
in september , the @entity9 ruled the accident should have been covered by compulsory vehicle insurance			1
as a result , motor insurance is now required to cover vehicles used in all situations — not just on roads			2
the definition has also now been extended to ‘ any motor vehicle intended for travel on land and propelled by mechanical power ’			0
tearaway : a man rides a mobility scooter , another of the vehicles that may be covered by the new ruling , which a @entity68 spokesman described as ' bonkers ' roads minister @entity70 said that it would probably lead to a rise in insurance costs for all @entity29 motorists			1
they are charged an average £ 30 levy to cover accidents involving untraced or uninsured drivers – which he said would have to go up as the scope of motor insurance was broadened			2
meanwhile , a @entity68 spokesman told @entity84 : ‘ this is clearly a bonkers ruling			1
' only with @entity87 as @entity88 will @entity29 people get a referendum on our membership of the @entity6			0

vehicles may be *included* in new ruling from @entity9
it follows a case involving a man hurt when his ladder was hit by a tractor
*conservative* *party* spokesman calls the new ruling ' bonkers '
