researchers commissioned by @entity2 's health ministry discovered what they claim as high levels of the chemical formaldehyde in the chemical produced by heating several types of e-cigarette liquid			1
formaldehyde is a substance that occurs naturally in the environment at low levels but is also found at higher levels in certain products such as building materials and embalming fluids			1
it is classed as a human carcinogen			0
e-cigarettes are becoming increasingly popular around the world , particularly among young people			0
e-cigarettes function by heating flavoured liquid , which often contains nicotine , to produce a vapour that is inhaled , much as the smoke from traditional cigarettes is inhaled			2
however , that result was not reported in the @entity2 study and the amount of formaldehyde detected did vary through the course of analysis			1
when the wire which vaporises the liquid gets overheated , higher amounts of harmful substances seem to be produced , dr @entity40 added			0
in general , levels of formaldehyde in e-cigarette vapour are up to 50 times lower compared to the levels found in tobacco cigarette smoke ; and even the worst case @entity2 product tested by the study produced levels of formaldehyde that were six times lower than in traditional cigarette smoke			1
in @entity2 , e-cigarettes are not regulated			1
nicotine e-cigarettes , or so - called @entity69 ( @entity69 ) , are subjected to the country 's pharmaceutical laws			1
although they are not readily available in shops as they are in the @entity76 and @entity77 , they can be bought easily on the internet			0
' you call them e-cigarettes , but they are products totally different from regular tobacco , ' the ministry official said			2
' the government is now studying the possible risks associated with them , with view to looking at how they should be regulated			2
' in august , the @entity87 ( @entity87 ) called on governments to ban the sale of e-cigarettes to minors , warning they pose a ' serious threat ' to unborn babies and young people			1
despite scant research on their effects , the @entity87 said there was enough evidence ' to caution children and adolescents , pregnant women , and women of reproductive age ' about e-cigarette use			1
supporters of e-cigarettes say the devices are a safer alternative to regular tobacco cigarettes , whose combination of toxic chemicals and gases can cause cancer , heart disease and strokes this was due to the ' potential for foetal and adolescent nicotine exposure ( having ) long - term consequences for brain development '			0
the @entity87 also said they should be banned from indoor public spaces			2
supporters of e-cigarettes say the devices are a safer alternative to traditional tobacco , whose bouquet of toxic chemicals and gases can cause cancer , heart disease and strokes			0
these are known to be among the leading causes of death in many countries			0
but opponents say the devices have only been around for a few years , and the long - term health impact from inhaling their vapour is unclear			0
big tobacco companies are snapping up producers of e-cigarettes , wary of missing out on a snowballing global market worth about $ 3 billion			0
earlier this month , @entity140 picked ' vape ' - the act of smoking an e-cigarette - as their new word of the year			0
* an earlier version of this article stated that @entity2 research had found that e-cigarettes contain 10 times more carcinogens than tobacco cigarettes			1
while the studyconducted by dr @entity40 , director of the @entity2 @entity150 , did claim to have found such high levels of one carcinogen ( formaldehyde ) in the vapour from one brand of electronic cigarette , we would like to clarify that this result was not included in the published research			1
in fact , the @entity2 study supports existing evidence that e-cigarettes are much less dangerous than tobacco products .			2
