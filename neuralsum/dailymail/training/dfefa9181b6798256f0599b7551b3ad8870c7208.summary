last night @entity33 sources suggested it could mean the inquiry being put on hold indefinitely while the police investigate			0
as police announced the probe yesterday , the director of public prosecutions @entity37 confirmed no @entity42 or @entity15 officer will face charges over two separate , long - running investigations into complicity in torture			1
the complaint against the @entity42 came from @entity48 , who said @entity42 knew he was being mistreated when it handed over questions to his @entity51 captors			0
police found @entity42 did pass information to the @entity51 but said there was ‘ insufficient evidence ’ to prove any officer knew @entity48 was being tortured at the time			0
prosecutors also concluded there was not enough evidence to prosecute an @entity15 officer for aiding and abetting torture over an incident at @entity64 in @entity65 in january 2002 when he interviewed a detainee			1

@entity23 is a senior military figure in the new @entity17 government and is suing @entity6 over his torture at the hands of @entity10 ’s henchmen			2
a @entity94 document found at the same time suggested @entity6 had launched its own operation to transfer another man , @entity97 , from @entity98 to @entity99			0
