by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent published : 19:17 est , 12 may 2013 updated : 02:09 est , 13 may 2013 twenty thousand migrants a year are being let into @entity4 under a loophole that could be exploited by sham - marriage racketeers , a report warns today			1
under @entity11 law , @entity8 nationals living in this country are allowed to bring in spouses or partners and their families from anywhere in the world with no checks or qualifications			1
but @entity4 citizens who want to bring in a wife , husband or partner and family from abroad must first show they have an income of £ 18,600 or more to guarantee their dependants will not become a burden on the taxpayer			0
think - tank @entity28 warns 20,000 people are entering @entity4 through a migration loophole the report by the @entity28 think - tank warns that 20,000 people a year are now coming to live in @entity4 as partners of a citizen of another @entity8 country			1
the loophole means the system is wide open to abuse by racketeers who can charge vast sums of money to set up a sham marriage , it said			2
sir @entity45 of @entity28 said : ‘ this is a loophole that must be closed and soon			1
' it is absurd that @entity8 citizens should be in a more favourable position than our own citizens			2
' furthermore , 20,000 per year is a very large number to admit unconditionally , especially compared to the government ’s target of tens of thousands for annual net migration			0
’ under the rules , a member of the family of an @entity8 citizen - who has the right to travel to and work freely in @entity4 - can bring in their family under a ‘ @entity64 family permit ’			1
the permit is issued to any national of another @entity8 country who is living in @entity4 and applies for it			2
under @entity8 law , @entity8 nationals living in the @entity4 can bring their spouse or partner with no checks the report said : ‘ a @entity77 or @entity78 person can marry someone from outside the @entity8 , say @entity80 or @entity81 , and can bring their spouse into the @entity4 , even if they do not have a job earning £ 18,600 or indeed any job			1
‘ the couple would be entitled to full access to the welfare state			0
a @entity4 or non-eu settled resident would not be allowed to bring in a spouse without this minimum income			0
’ a number of @entity94 nationals from the former @entity96 territory of @entity97 are thought to have taken advantage of the loophole			0
@entity94 living in @entity97 can claim they have @entity96 heritage and so claim @entity96 citizenship			0
they can then move directly to @entity4 – without ever having to visit @entity96 – and bring a family without meeting any qualification test			0
a spokesman for the @entity105 said : ' @entity8 citizens do not have unrestricted access to the @entity4 - they must be exercising their treaty rights by working , studying or being self - sufficient			1
' the prime minister has recently announced a number of changes including strengthening residence testing and limiting the amount of time migrants can claim benefits			0

think - tank @entity28 said loophole can be exploited by racketeers
@entity8 nationals are allowed to bring in spouses or partners without checks
sir @entity45 from think - tank said loophole ' must be closed and soon '
