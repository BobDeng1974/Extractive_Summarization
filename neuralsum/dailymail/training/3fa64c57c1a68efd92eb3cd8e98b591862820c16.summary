a young woman who says she 's addicted to sunbeds admits even getting skin cancer has n't put her off tanning			1
@entity5 , 29 , from @entity6 , was keen to get back on a sunbed as soon as she had recovered from an operation to remove a cancerous mole on her leg			1
she told @entity11 and @entity12 on today 's @entity13 : ' it 's been very hard to stop , i want to hide away			2
i feel like a tan gives me a blanket and without it , i have to hide away			2
i tried fake tan and it 's just not the same			1
her sister @entity25 has also had to have moles removed over fears they were cancerous mother - of - one @entity5 appeared on the @entity30 show with her twin sister , @entity25 , who has also had a skin cancer health scare			1
the pair , who are care workers , both started tanning at the age of 14 and it quickly became a daily ritual			2
they liked the way the tan made them look and feel more confident			2
' it was new to our town , it was a thing to do , ' @entity25 explained			1
mother - of - two @entity25 stopped going on sunbeds four years ago but some damage was already done			1
dying for a tan : the twins started using sunbeds at the age of 14 and have both had health scares she said : ' i noticed a mole on my side which i thought was chocolate because of how quickly it came but it did n't wipe off			1
i went to the doctors to have it looked at and they referred me and took it off straight away			0
' there was a difficult four to five week wait to see if it was cancer but it was ok			0
' despite @entity25 's scare , @entity5 was not put off going on a sunbed			1
' i put what happened to @entity25 to the back of my mind			2
i thought it would n't happen to me , ' she admits			0
but then she also noticed an unusual - looking mole on her leg that was turning a dark blue colour			0
' i showed it to @entity25 and she knew straight away there was something wrong with it , ' she said			2
the mole was removed but further tests revealed @entity5 was not as lucky as her sister had been			1
' i was told it was cancer - melanoma - and i would need further treatment			0
i felt stupid , like i had done it to myself , ' she said			0
be safe : fake tan is an alternative to using sun beds for those who want a tan without the dangers a good way to tell the difference between a normal mole and a melanoma is to use the @entity93 checklist : a stands for asymmetrical : melanomas have two very different halves and are an irregular shape			1
@entity98 stands for border : unlike a normal mole , melanomas have a notched or ragged border			0
@entity103 stands for colours : melanomas will be a mix of two or more colours			0
@entity108 stands for diameter : unlike most moles , melanomas are larger than 6mm ( 1/4 inch ) in diameter			0
@entity113 stands for enlargement or evolution : a mole that changes characteristics and size over time is more likely to be a melanoma			0
information taken from www.nhs.uk ' i could n't take it all in , i had to leave the room			0
i had an operation on my leg and i 've been left with a big scar			0
' but despite the shock diagnosis and treatment , @entity5 still ca n't give up using sunbeds			1
she 's been back on them following her operation and said she needs help to conquer what she calls an addiction			0
' my face was n't going right without the sunbed , ' she said			0
' i felt like the skin on my face was drying out and my make up does n't sit right without a tan			2
' @entity142 and @entity12 encouraged @entity5 to try fake tan as an alternative to sun beds and invited her back on the show next week to test them			1
the show 's resident medical expert , dr @entity148 , who has suffered from skin cancer , advised @entity5 to follow her sister 's example and give up sunbeds for good			1
he told her to think of her son and how she was putting him in danger of growing up without his mother			0
' i will be happy in my skin one day , it 's just getting there , ' @entity5 said .			1
