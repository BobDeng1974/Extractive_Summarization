by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 16:41 est , 21 april 2013 @entity3 : 11:17 est , 22 april 2013 unruly : @entity4 says children in @entity7 nurseries are not taught how to behave themselves education minister @entity4 has been criticisied for ' ill - judged ' criticism of nurseries after she declared they were producing a generation of toddlers with no manners			1
ms @entity4 condemned ‘ chaotic ’ pre-schools that allow children to do what they want all day long , leaving them unable to sit still and listen by the time they get to primary school			1
but industry bodies today said her remarks did not chime with experiences in nurseries across the country			2
in an interview with the @entity26 , miss @entity4 said many nurseries were filled with toddlers ‘ running around with no sense of purpose ’			1
she called for a traditional approach akin to that found in @entity33 , where children typically start working with a graduate - level teacher from the age of two and are expected to say ‘ hello ’ when an adult enters the room			1
in the @entity39 today she defended her remarks , telling mps : ' it is a very sad fact that 33 per cent of children arrive at school without the requisite communication and language skills that they need to take part in school education			2
' the minister ’s criticism comes as the government prepares to offer tax breaks to help working parents with the cost of childcare			1
from 2015 , working couples will qualify for tax breaks worth as much as £ 1,200 a year per child			0
some @entity59 @entity40 have claimed the scheme discriminates against stay - at - home mothers , but ministers say there is evidence that up to a million women want to work but are put off by nursery or childminder costs			2
miss @entity4 ’s intervention suggests the government believes there is much work to be done to improve the quality of care in nurseries before the tax breaks come into effect			1
she said education watchdog @entity76 will be expected to mark down pre-school providers who do not take on better - qualified staff and offer children more structure			2
‘ this is n’t about two - year - olds doing academic work – it ’s structured play which teaches children to be polite and considerate through activities which the teacher is clearly leading , ’ she said			2
‘ at the moment fewer than one - third of nurseries employ graduate - level teachers and have structured , teacher - led sessions			2
we know that ’s very beneficial			0
‘ what you notice in @entity33 nurseries is just how calm they are			1
all of their classes are structured and led by teachers			0
' they learn to socialise with each other , pay attention to the teacher and develop good manners , which is not the case in too many nurseries in @entity7			1
’ teaching manners : children need their days in nurseries structured in order to learn manners as well as how to behave in a classroom in time for primary school she said of the @entity7 system : ‘ free - flow play is not compulsory , but there is a belief across lots of nurseries that it is			1
i have seen too many chaotic settings , where children are running around			0
there ’s no sense of purpose			0
‘ in these settings where there are n’t sufficiently qualified staff , and children are running around , we are not getting positive outcomes			0
improving care : @entity138 truss , a mother - of - two , says nurseries need to better prepare children for school ‘ we want children to learn to listen to a teacher , learn to respect an instruction , so that they are ready for school			1
’ the married mother of two , who is increasingly tipped for high office , said it was clear that far too many existing nurseries are ‘ not good enough ’ – and stressed the importance of good preparation for primary school			0
‘ children get into the habit of waiting their turn , of saying hello to the teacher when they come into the room , ’ she said			0
the minister highlighted the government ’s changes to rules on child - to - adult ratios , to encourage nurseries to employ better - paid graduates			1
teachers can already look after up to 13 children aged three and four years , compared with just eight for less well - qualified staff			0
her intervention will delight parents and educators who believe a more traditional approach is necessary in vital pre-school years			0
however , it risks angering trade union leaders and those who insist it is best to ‘ let children be children ’ before they reach primary school			0
@entity181 , chief executive of the @entity182 , said : ' it is frankly astonishing that the minister in charge of childcare makes such ill - judged , off - the - cuff statements about what she believes is happening in day nurseries and pre-schools			1
' the picture the minister paints is not one that would be recognised by anyone who knows anything about child development and learning			0
' but @entity196 , chief executive of the @entity197 said : ' we agree with the minister that a chaotic environment is not good for children			1
' we believe that learning needs to be age appropriate and support the children ’s individual needs			1
group led structured learning is important but must be balanced with the opportunity for one - to - one adult : child interaction			0
' from september , @entity76 will only consider ratings of ‘ good ’ or ‘ outstanding ’ to be acceptable for nurseries and pre-schools ; the ‘ satisfactory ’ rating will be scrapped and replaced with ‘ requires improvement ’			2
@entity76 head sir @entity214 recently decried the ‘ absolute nonsense ’ that more exams are needed to work with animals than young children .			0

miss @entity4 claimed children in nurseries are not taught how to behave
