by @entity1 reporter published : 06:11 est , 6 december 2013 updated : 09:16 est , 6 december 2013 a mother found a smouldering cigarette butt in her @entity5 takeaway after a strong stench of smoke started coming from her microwave as she reheated her meal			1
@entity10 , 32 , does n't smoke so was surprised when the acrid smell began wafting through the house			1
the mother - of - four discovered the cigarette end nestled in the middle of her rice as she started sharing it with her one - year - old daughter			1
very special fried rice : the takeaway tray in which @entity10 , from @entity20 , @entity21 , found a cigarette mrs @entity10 had already eaten most of the £ 32 takeaway the previous night so was disgusted to see what had been hidden in her meal			1
she complained to the nearby @entity28 in @entity20 , @entity21 , where staff apologised and refunded her - but denied the cigarette was theirs			1
the full - time mother , who lives with non-smoking husband @entity34 , 35 , said : ' i was disgusted			1
we ’ve had takeaways from there before and never had any problems			0
@entity40 : staff denied the cigarette was theirs , but neither mrs @entity10 nor her husband smoke ' we ’d got a few different things because we were really tired and just wanted an easy meal			1
' it ’s something we do maybe once a month and in the end a lot of it went in the fridge for later in the week			0
' when i began to heat it up the place immediately reeked of smoke but i just put it down to a faulty microwave			2
' me and my daughter must have had seven or eight spoonfuls before i found the cigarette butt			0
' mrs @entity10 , who asked not to be pictured , added : ' i was very angry and very worried because my baby could have put it in her mouth			2
' i wo n’t be ordering from there again and i do n’t think we will have takeaway again			0
i think it is best to stick to home cooking from now on			0
' @entity70 claimed that when she phoned to complain about the incident she was told the chef responsible for the cigarette had been ' disciplined '			0
she has now reported the incident to @entity76 ’s environmental health team who are investigating			0
however , @entity78 , director of the restaurant , said all meals were prepared fresh and kitchen staff are adamant no one was smoking in the kitchen on that night			2
she added : ' i ’m 100 per cent sure there was no tobacco in the meal			0

@entity10 , 32 , bought the meal from a restaurant in @entity20 , @entity21
mother - of - four had already eaten some of the rice the night before
but when mrs @entity10 reheated it she was *overcome* by the smell of smoke
she was feeding special fried rice to *toddler* when she *spotted* the butt
neither she nor her husband @entity34 , 35 , are smokers
