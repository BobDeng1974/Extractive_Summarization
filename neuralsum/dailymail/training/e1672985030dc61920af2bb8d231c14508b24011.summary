@entity8 , 39 , began pouring out fusilli from @entity10 to make a tuna pasta bake for her daughters @entity13 , seven and @entity14 , five , when she saw the infestation of weevils			1
the mother - of - two quickly threw the @entity20 @entity19 brand pasta and the bugs in the bin and sealed up the bag that had not been opened before			1
upset : @entity24 , seven , and her sister @entity14 , five , at their home in @entity27 , @entity28 holding the pasta which contained weevil bugs she has no idea how the swarm of the beetle - type bug got into the 500g bag			1
mrs @entity8 called @entity10 to complain and was at first told someone would come and collect the packet from her home in @entity27 , @entity28 , so they could investigate			1
when nobody arrived she emailed the supermarket giant again but was then told she would have to return it to a store			0
mrs @entity8 , an account manager at a marketing company , said she is concerned that other bags of pasta could contain the bugs			1
mrs @entity8 said : ' i bought the pasta from the @entity10 online shopping service			2
infested : some of the @entity49 found in the @entity19 fusilli pasta from @entity10 which was bought online shocked : mother - of - two @entity51 , 39 was about to cook a tuna pasta bake when she noticed the bugs return : @entity10 said they would pick up the contaminated package from their home , but when no one arrived , mrs @entity24 was forced to take it into a store a weevil is a type of beetle which is usually less than six millimetres ( 0.24 in ) long			1
there are more than 60,000 species in several families and can often be found in dry foods including nuts and seeds , cereal and grain products , such as pancake mix. in the domestic setting , they are most likely to be found when a bag of flour is opened			0
their presence is often indicated by the granules of the infested item sticking together in strings , as if caught in a cobweb			0
' i opened it and tipped some into a pan for my children ’s dinner and noticed lots of little black things			2
' initially i thought it might have been something burnt on the bottom of the pan so i drained the pasta under the tap , then i looked closer and saw they were insects			2
' i looked at the rest of the packet and it was absolutely crawling with them			0
there must have been hundreds of the things			0
' my two children were horrified and now wo n’t eat pasta again			1
' i had no idea what they were so i looked it up on the internet and realised they were weevil bugs			0
' i contacted @entity10 and they said someone would come and collect the pasta but they did n’t turn up , so i emailed them and they told me that it was n’t their policy to do so			0
' they refunded me the money and gave me a 10 pounds compensation voucher but it ’s not money i ’m after			2
' i am outraged that they did n’t want to find out where these weevils came from , it ’s like they do n’t care			0
' a @entity10 spokeswoman said : ' if a customer finds something in their food that they think should n’t be there , we would ask them to return it to store as soon as possible so we can conduct a thorough investigation			0
' a spokesman for @entity19 , the company who makes the pasta , said : ' our key desire is to reassure your readers that all our products are made to very high quality standards , so they should not be concerned that this is normal			1
' equally , though , we all have to accept that natural products attract natural issues from time to time but that said , our processes are set up to eradicate all of these which are within our control to do so			0
' swarm : one of the hundreds of bugs that were found crawling round the packet of pasta food : the packet of pasta which arrived at the @entity24 bugs with hundreds of weevil bugs inside			2
