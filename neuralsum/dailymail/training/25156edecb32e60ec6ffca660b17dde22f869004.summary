by @entity0 published : 10:55 est , 3 march 2014 updated : 13:55 est , 3 march 2014 study of excavations at the @entity5 site has cleared @entity6 of calculated murders did @entity6 hunters drive mammoth herds over cliffs in brutal mass killings ? it ’s a question that has been puzzling archaeologists since the 1960s following the discovery of heaped mammoth bones in @entity17			1
but a new study of excavations at the @entity21 site now appears to have cleared @entity6 of these calculated murders or mass hunts			1
researchers at the @entity25 have found that the land that ends at the cliff edge was so rocky that mammoths would never have gone up there , according to a report in the @entity31			1
successfully driving animals over the cliff would first require that they be present upon an elevated , rocky plateau , ’ the researchers write in the journal @entity37			2
‘ if such a herd was present , driving them over the cliff would then require forcing them over these natural barriers and up onto a fairly restricted space on the headland			0
pictured is a simplified geological map of @entity17 , showing the position of the main sites studied			2
the land , now under water , would have been an ideal vantage point for @entity6 hunters as it included ravines , gullies and valleys heaps of mammoth bones found piled up at the foot of a cliff were initially thought to be the results of @entity6 driving the creatures over the edge ‘ this landscape would divide a herd and actively direct them away from the supposed death trap			1
’ the site was home to @entity6 for around 200,000 years , but it is thought it was abandoned at time when the climate cooled , forcing @entity6 into warmer areas			1
to recreate the landscape that the @entity6 lived , researchers looked at a survey of the seabed that stretches away from the cliff			2
the land , now under water , would have been an ideal vantage point for @entity6 hunters as it included ravines , gullies and valleys			2
even if the creatures had clambered so high , the @entity6 would have had to move them through a dip at @entity17 's @entity21 site			1
the dip is in the top image			0
the bottom image shows the site as it is today @entity17 is believed to be one of the last places the @entity6 lived after teeth were discovered on its @entity21 cave in 1910 ‘ it offered @entity6 a landscape in which large mammals could be both effectively controlled and ambushed , ’ the researchers write			1
older sediments at the site have large amounts of burnt bone and charcoal , suggesting that the bones collected and used as fuel			0
the research team believes the @entity6 could also have carried the bones there after hunts and used them for building shelters and food			1
@entity17 is believed to be one of the last places the @entity6 lived after teeth were discovered on its @entity21 cave in 1910			1
the cave has so far produced more @entity6 stone tools than the rest of the @entity114 put together			0
findings bring the collections of stone tools , animal bone and @entity6 remains under renewed study evidence has been uncovered that @entity17 may have been home to one of the last @entity6			1
@entity114 archaeologists have now found that a large portion of @entity21 contains sediment dating to the last @entity126 , preserving 250,000 years of climate change and archaeological evidence			0
‘ in terms of the volume of sediment , archaeological richness and depth of time , there is nothing else like it known in the @entity114 , ’ said dr @entity129 of the @entity130 at @entity131 , who helped lead the research			0
‘ given that we thought these deposits had been removed entirely by previous researchers , finding that so much still remains is as exciting as discovering a new site			0
’ the team dated sediments at the site using a technique called @entity151 stimulated @entity152 , which measures the last time sand grains were exposed to sunlight			0
the results showed that part of the sequence of sediments dates between 100,000 and 47,000 years old , indicating that @entity6 teeth which were discovered at the site in 1910 were younger than previously thought			2
according to the researchers , they probably belonged to one of the last @entity6 to live in the region			0
‘ the discovery that these deposits still exist and can be related to previously excavated deposits opens up a range of exciting possibilities , ’ said dr @entity165 , @entity166 , who is leading current fieldwork at the site .			0

the land was so rocky that mammoths would never have reached cliff top
even if creatures had clambered that high , the @entity6 would have had to move them through a dip at @entity17 's @entity21 site
instead of mass murders , heap of bones could be *explained* if @entity6 piled them together to build shelters and used them for heat and food
