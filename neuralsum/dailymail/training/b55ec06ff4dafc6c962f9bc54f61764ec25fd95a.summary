clamour : @entity0 claims that he was too young at the time of @entity3 s vile acts to have known about them @entity0 was facing a growing clamour last night to reveal what he knew and when about the @entity8 paedophilia scandal			1
the @entity10 leader , who had issued glowing tributes to the 29 - stone mp , said yesterday that he was too young at the time of @entity8 ’s vile acts to have known about them			1
but politicians and child protection campaigners said his denial was not credible given the evidence that @entity8 ’s activities were widely known in @entity19 and his @entity21 constituency			1
and senior @entity10 @entity22 conceded last night there could have been an establishment cover - up of ‘ paedophilia on a very large scale ’			1
allegations against @entity8 were published in magazines in 1979 and aired publicly at an election hustings in 1987 , while prominent liberals confirmed they had heard the rumours over many years			1
yet mr @entity0 described @entity8 as a ‘ beacon ’ and an ‘ inspiration ’ on his 80th birthday in 2008 , and said he was ‘ deeply saddened ’ at his death two years later			1
he tried to withdraw those remarks yesterday when faced with the @entity38 ’s revelations about how the predatory mp ’s serial abuse of vulnerable boys as young as eight was covered up			1
the @entity10 leader said : ‘ i would never have dreamed of saying the things that i said if i was aware of the truly horrific nature of the actions which he is alleged to have undertaken over a long period of time			0
’ he added : ‘ @entity8 stood down as an mp 13 years before i became an mp			2
many of the actions , the repugnant actions , which we now learn about took place well before the party i now lead even existed – in fact , took place before i even existed			1
‘ given those facts and that chronology , it is – as my party has made quite clear – not surprising that the @entity10 , who were founded in 1989 , two or three years before @entity8 stood down , were not aware			2
’ but critics rejected mr @entity0 ’s bizarre defence , pointing out that his party evolved out of the old @entity63 and most @entity10 mps and activists became @entity10			1
' however , critics say the abuse was well known in @entity19 and in his @entity21 constituency @entity71 , the @entity72 mp for @entity73 , said : ‘ that ’s a pathetic excuse – as pathetic as you can get			1
they are the same party			0
@entity0 really needs to show some leadership on this			2
‘ i do n’t believe that they knew nothing			0
the @entity10 need to hold their own investigation into what they knew and what they covered up			0
’ business secretary mr @entity22 told @entity87 ’s @entity86 : ‘ it is horrific , it is really horrible			2
let ’s remember this was a very long time ago			0
we ’re talking 40 - 50 years ago			0
' this is the ( @entity95 ) @entity94 era			0
i was actually a member of the @entity97 when all of this happened			0
i ’ve no personal recollection of it			0
’ asked whether the case was an establishment cover - up , he said : ‘ that ’s the suggestion			1
this is criminal paedophilia on a very large scale			1
’ @entity110 , chief executive of the @entity111 in @entity112 , said : ‘ i would have thought that somebody of the stature of the leader of the @entity10 would at least find out what they needed to find out before making a statement about such a controversial figure			0
' i have lost count of the number of people i have spoken to in the last 24 hours who said it was well known how dodgy @entity8 was			2
’ he added : ‘ it is incredible that they should be denying this now – what that will be doing is rubbing salt in the wounds of his many victims as well as survivors generally			0
’ former @entity10 mp @entity136 said mr @entity0 could not ‘ wash his hands ’ of @entity8 ’s abuse because it happened before he took over the @entity10			1
he added : ‘ if you ’re leader of an organisation , you have got a responsibility to know what is going on in it			0
you ca n’t simply hide behind history and say it was none of your business			0
’ a devastating new book by @entity72 mp @entity149 discloses how politicians , police and the security services left @entity8 free to molest children for four decades			1
fresh revelations from the book serialised in today ’s @entity38 include : @entity8 was a leading figure in a paedophile ring which carried out sickening abuse at @entity159 , a school for boys with learning difficulties in @entity21			1
the mp called for police to raid the home of a whistle - blower who went public with claims that pupils as young as eight were being subjected to extreme sexual abuse			1
in 1979 , the @entity170 newspaper printed allegations that @entity8 had abused young boys , which were repeated by the national satirical magazine @entity173			1
@entity174 , then @entity10 leader , was told about the claims			0
his spokesman responded at the time : ‘ all he seems to have done is spanked a few bare bottoms			0
’ @entity72 mp @entity149 , who lifted the lid on @entity8 ’s crimes , has accused the @entity182 of ‘ extraordinary bias ’ in its coverage of the affair			2
@entity186 ignored the @entity38 ’s saturday front - page revelations , only to change tack 24 hours later , when @entity8 ’s family said they were ‘ saddened and concerned ’ by its publication			2
in a hostile report , the @entity182 website said the family believed mr @entity149 was ‘ motivated by political and financial gain ’			0
the @entity72 mp , who is sending a formal complaint to director general @entity197 , said : ‘ here we have a book showing that @entity8 was a paedophile for more than 40 years , and the @entity182 ’s first reaction is not to ask why it was covered up , or to look at the horrors his victims went through and the lives he ruined			1
instead , they ask whether the bloke who wrote it is biased			0
’ mr @entity149 added : ‘ the fact that this story is being led by the @entity38 has driven the @entity182 to take a particular view			0
if this book had been serialised by the @entity212 , it would be leading their news bulletins			0
’ a @entity182 spokesman said : ‘ [ @entity8 ] is an ongoing story that we have covered extensively in the past , and will continue to report on as and when there are developments that warrant it			2
’ @entity8 ’s alleged abuse of boys was also publicly raised during the 1987 general election campaign by his @entity72 opponent , @entity222			1
mr @entity222 told the @entity38 : ‘ everyone in @entity21 had heard rumours about him , and i believed they should be properly investigated			2
perhaps it was dirty politics on my behalf , but @entity8 was a dirty politician , so i decided to do it			0
’ mr @entity149 says that @entity8 ’s ‘ penchant for boys ’ was an ‘ open secret ’ and widely discussed in bars around @entity229			2
@entity233 , a @entity63 mp from 1983 to 1987 , has said that ‘ whispers ’ that @entity8 ‘ liked boys ’ circulated in @entity19			1
@entity236 , @entity8 ’s successor as @entity10 mp for @entity21 , said she heard ‘ inklings of rumours ’ but defended @entity8 to her friends and colleagues			1
she added : ‘ i never saw any evidence of impropriety – if i had , i would have gone straight to the police			0
’ despite clear evidence that @entity8 ’s sickening activities were well known , a string of senior @entity10 have insisted they had were taken by surprise when his abuse was exposed after his death			1
a spokesman for @entity251 , the former @entity10 leader , said he ‘ absolutely and categorically denies any knowledge of any such allegations ’			0
baroness @entity254 , a founding member of the @entity255 and now a @entity10 peer , added : ‘ i went to @entity257 in 1986 as professor at the @entity259 and did not return until 1996 , so i can not comment on rumours about @entity8 or what actions if any were taken in those years			2
’ @entity174 , who put @entity8 forward for his knighthood , has not commented on the revelations			0
solicitor @entity268 , from law firm @entity264 , who is representing a number of @entity8 ’s victims , said there was a discrepancy between the mounting evidence that the mp ’s abuse was widely known and the @entity10 ’ claims of ignorance			1
he added : ‘ the story i do n’t think is going to go away because there is this mis - match that does n’t make sense			0

@entity0 says he was too young to know about @entity8 **'s** vile acts
allegations published in magazines in 1979 and aired publicly in 1987
' many of the actions took place before the party i lead even existed ' - @entity0
but @entity8 **'s** actions known in @entity19 and his constituency , critics say
@entity22 said there could have been a cover - up on a ' very large scale '
@entity8 was a leading figure in a paedophile ring which carried out sickening abuse at @entity159 , a school for boys with learning difficulties in @entity21 .
the mp called for police to raid the home of a whistle - blower who went public with claims that pupils as young as eight were being subjected to extreme sexual abuse .
he then arranged for members of the paedophile ring to *bombard* the whistle - blower with *threatening* phone calls , *vowing* to abuse his children .
@entity8 *befriended* serial sex abuser @entity321 and *starred* with him in a party political broadcast for the @entity63 .
