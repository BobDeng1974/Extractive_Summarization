a stunning timelapse video has shown a very different sight of @entity2 should it have an entire blackout			0
in a metropolis like @entity2 , @entity6 , light pollution makes the night sky invisible			1
only a few of the brightest stars and asterisms force their celestial light through the man made glow of the city			0

the @entity18 would represent a shadowy figure clashing against the night sky should @entity2 ever experience a blackout how the 87 - storey @entity18 looks now at night , in the @entity22 development , imposing on the @entity2 landscape but imagine if all the lights at famous @entity2 landmarks such as @entity26 , the @entity18 and @entity27 were all turned off			2

@entity26 with no traffic ! this scene , with only space 's natural light , makes this iconic @entity2 scene as if out of a fairy tale the bright lights of @entity2 , from buildings and vehicles , make us forget how beautiful the night sky could be the blackout video gives viewers a special look at what the @entity2 night sky would look like - and it is impressive it attempts to show what the night sky would look like if there were ever to be a total blackout in @entity2 on a clear , moonless , summers night			1
