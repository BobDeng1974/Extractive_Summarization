storing up experience : @entity1 pictured outside the @entity3 fulfillment centre he works at with all the subtlety of an angry bear , the alarm on my phone wrestles me from my brief , blissful slumber			1
@entity10 and tired , i peel myself from the sheets , feeling the stiffness in my legs and the dull ache in the soles of my feet as they reluctantly touch the floor			0
dead to the world , i push a toothbrush around my mouth , trying to avoid eye contact with the zombie in the mirror			2
i pull on the battered trainers , tracksuit bottoms and a t - shirt i 'd dropped on the bedroom floor seconds before falling asleep last night , zip up my windproof jacket , clip my bike lights into place and set off on the hour - long ride to work			1
meanwhile , the kitchen clock shows 5.30am			0
once at work , i punch a code into a drinks machine and watch it spit tea into a paper cup , while other exhausted ghosts limp into view and exchange supportive nods of acknowledgment			2
i just have time to wolf down a breakfast cereal bar before my shift starts at 7am			0
for the next 11 - and - a - half - hours , i will be pushing a trolley around a giant warehouse in @entity50 , @entity51			2
it 's back - breaking work - i will probably walk a total of 20 miles today - just one ant among 1,500 others , scurrying around a vast complex of jaw - dropping logistical genius and breath - taking productivity			1
i do n't think i have ever felt so exhausted in my life			0
i am working for @entity3 at one of its eight @entity62 fulfilment centres - the huge warehouses which store , process , package and deliver the online retailer 's stock , during the @entity70 rush			1
this is not what i thought i 'd end up doing , the @entity70 after graduating from @entity73 with a 2:1 degree in music			0
i 'd hoped to be an officer in the @entity77 by now - or earning good money as a jobbing musican , while the application process limped along			2
but work was irregular and sometimes badly paid			2
i tried , and failed , to find other employment and reluctantly had to sign on the dole - something i prayed i 'd never have to do			2
at @entity3 , i am paid £ 7 an hour and have to work 55 hours a week , with no choice of when i do them			1
if i 'm lucky , though , i can pick between day or night shifts			2
does this mean i 'm ungrateful ? certainly not			0
nor does it mean i am the only graduate from an elite university working here			0
far from being surrounded by uneducated manual workers , i am pushing my trolley alongside law graduates , classicists and mathematicians , many from top universities like mine			2
educated : @entity1 pictured with his mother @entity97 at his graduation from @entity73 , @entity99 and at a university party queueing up in the @entity3 canteen the other day , i overheard two people discussing where they did their masters			1
it 's a common conversation - opener here			1
you are , in fact , just as likely to find someone to discuss the works of @entity110 and @entity111 with , as you are to find a drinking partner for the pub. far from being lazy and workshy , as is the current lament from employers about young @entity62 workers , none of my colleagues is complaining			1
they , like me , are grateful for the work - any work			1
it makes me smile when i think of all the people who will be opening the @entity70 presents delivered by @entity3 next week : books , dvds and more			1
who among them could guess at the sheer intellectual weight and quality of education behind the service ? for it is hard out there			0
in the past six months , i must have applied for every job imaginable			2
one of them involved knocking on doors to sell double - glazing			2
' work hard , and you might earn as much as £ 200 in your first week , ' we were told at interview			2
the next day i was rung to be told : ' we 're sorry mr @entity142 , but we had 30 people applying for two jobs			1
' privileged background : his parents did n't earn much , so @entity1 was fortunate to be given a bursary to @entity149 academic potential : @entity1 did so well at @entity151 that he was admitted to @entity99 desperate for work , i even left a note on the windscreen of a pick - up truck , offering to split the logs it was loaded with			1
then my adviser at the @entity160 told me @entity3 was recruiting , and suggested i apply			1
it is the world 's largest online retailer , with a revenue four times greater than that of the next largest , @entity164 , and exceeding the gdps of half the countries in the world			1
on average , it serves 20 million customers worldwide daily , and on december 2 this year @entity3 @entity62 beat the record it set just three days earlier by selling 4.1 million items in one day – - or 47 a second			1
to respond to demand , 15,000 extra people are employed over the festive period at @entity3 's @entity62 warehouses			1
when i went for my induction , i was desperate to become one of them - despite my privileged education			2
about eight of us , aged between 20 and 40 , were quizzed by a recruitment agency			2
the first question was whether we had our passports as @entity184			0
at this point , one member of the group left			0
he simply did n't possess one			0
then we were told that there would be a drugs test and everyone would also be @entity191 tested - and would n't be allowed to work if we had any unspent convictions			1
again , the group diminished			0
the remaining five of us sat a simple test , after which another person was escorted from the room			0
after signing a few forms and peeing into a cup , the now select group was told : ' training is at eight o'clock tomorrow , and you start work the day after that			1
' apparently my tutor was n't joking when he said i 'd never be asked what class of degree i have			0
i soon got talking to @entity207 , who has worked for @entity3 since the summer			1
' i studied criminology with a view to becoming a policeman , ' he explained			0
' only the week i graduated , the government cut thousands of police jobs			0
' i still want to join the force , or become a fireman , but for now this job is fine			2
what would be the point of taking a stand and refusing to do a job because i consider it below me ? what 's the alternative ? i 'd rather be working than doing nothing			1
' @entity223 is married , probably in his early 50s			0
he left the @entity224 to study employment law			0
he 's working for @entity3 so he can save up to do his masters at @entity99 and become a lecturer			1
back - breaking work : employees at @entity3 's fulfillment centres often walk a total of 20 miles per day compensation : they are paid £ 7 an hour and have to work 55 hours a week , with no choice of when they work @entity237 's largest online retailer : @entity3 's revenue exceeds the gdps of half the countries in the world for every graduate employed by @entity3 this @entity70 , there are several more who did n't make it : including my elder brother , @entity245			1
he read maths at @entity99 and has just finished a computer science masters at @entity249			0
on my second day at work , i called him during a precious break to tell him about the job and he rushed home from @entity249 , just in time for an induction on the last day of recruitment			1
but the news was not what he had hoped			0
despite passing all the tests , @entity258 was surplus to requirements			0
he 's on the waiting list now , and hoping for a phone call in case an employee calls in sick			2
he lives with two other @entity249 graduates : one is still jobless and the other has been working as a part - time shop assistant for 18 months			1
heightened demand : over the holidays , 15,000 extra people are employed at @entity3 's @entity62 warehouses - but many of those hoping for work are nonetheless turned away ' work hard , and you might earn as much as £ 200 in your first week , ' @entity1 was told at interview when my older sister , @entity278 , left @entity99 , a friend with a @entity280 in history was obliged to work for the first six months completely unpaid - something only the privileged can afford - while my sister spent months trying to get an interview			1
my other sister @entity285 also graduated from @entity99 this summer with a good 2:1 in classics , but is still unemployed			0
for me , the job is worth more than just @entity70 money			2
like many @entity99 students , and unlike many of my new colleagues , i had a privileged upbringing			0
although my father , a clergyman , has never earned much and nor does my writer mother , i was extremely fortunate to be given a bursary to @entity149			0
less fortunate : @entity245 , @entity1 's brother , read maths at @entity99 and has just finished a computer science masters at @entity249			1
he hopes to find employment at @entity3 i was n't a sheltered upbringing - we lived in an inner - city vicarage , and often cared for the homeless			1
but most of my schoolfriends had little experience of life outside their elite social class			0
if my application to become a @entity311 officer is successful , i will serve on a warship alongside ratings ( non-officers )			0
this is considered to be one of the most important elements of training			0
i feel that working a @entity70 season in an @entity3 fulfilment centre is ample preparation			1
in here , we are all equal - just workers , grafting to get the job done , and i relish the experience			1
as soon as i swipe my access card and enter the building , i am no longer a privileged individual , just a small cog in a vast machine			0
it is a humbling experience , and one i hope to remember wherever life takes me			0
and there are other perks in the meantime : on my first day i was taken to the top floor of the building , from where i could see the vast crates brimming with @entity70 presents			0
quite unexpectedly , something stirred inside me , and i could n't wait to tell my ten - year - old youngest sister that i am working in @entity342 's grotto because , let 's face it , this is it , in reality			1
now who could complain about having that on their cv ?			0

@entity3 is the world 's largest online retailer
over the holidays , *15k* extra people are employed at their @entity62 warehouses
the work is back - breaking ; employees often walk a total of 20 miles a day
but in a tough job market , graduates like @entity1 are eager to be taken on
