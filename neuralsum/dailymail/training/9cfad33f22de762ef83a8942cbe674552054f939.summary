almost half of both @entity1 and @entity3 's starting lineups for their @entity5 last - 16 tie in @entity6 came from the @entity7			1
here , @entity8 looks at how the @entity10 - based contingent got on in monday 's game : one winner : @entity13 comes out on top against @entity16 striker @entity15 in this duel familiar foes : @entity19 and @entity20 came up against each other on the international stage troubles in front of goal : @entity26 hooks @entity28 's shot off the line as @entity3 looked to hold the @entity30 best of enemies : @entity13 and @entity32 go up for a header during the last - 16 tie anticipation : @entity36 tries to get in the way of a @entity15 shot 19 minutes : @entity40 's @entity39 gets beaten by @entity41 at his near post			1
luckily the goal is ruled out 28 minutes : @entity15 appears to aim an elbow at @entity45 - but the incident goes unspotted by the referee			2
37 minutes : @entity20 has his arms wrapped around @entity19 but the referee decides it does not warrant a penalty			0
39 minutes : finding himself running onto a pass on the edge of the box , @entity52 blasts one of @entity1 's best chances wide			2
48 minutes : @entity45 brilliantly nutmegs @entity61 target @entity59 with a backheel 63 minutes : @entity19 flashes a snapshot at goal from the edge of the area but @entity39 gets down low to save his powerful effort			0
68 minutes : @entity26 races back behind his goalkeeper to clear @entity28 's shot off the line and keep the score at 0 - 0			1
74 minutes : this time it 's @entity45 's turn to clear off the line as @entity1 turn up the pressure			1
@entity76 ( @entity1 , @entity40 ) - 90 minutes the @entity40 ' keeper was perhaps lucky not to concede in the first half after @entity3 's @entity41 was narrowly adjudged to be offside as he put @entity3 ahead , beating @entity39 at his near post			1
otherwise the sweeper - keeper was at his commanding best , dominating the high balls that @entity3 tried to send into the @entity30 penalty area			2
@entity52 ( @entity1 , @entity83 ) - 90 minutes the @entity83 man , starting ahead of new @entity85 right back @entity86 ably supported @entity87 down the right hand side			2
he was rarely tested defensively and even had a decent effort at goal towards the end of the first half with a shot that flew wide			0
@entity32 ( @entity1 , @entity16 ) - 90 minutes solid at the back , as he has been all season for his club			1
@entity32 dealt well with the high balls that @entity3 sent into the box but in truth he was rarely troubled except occasionally by @entity19 's pace			2
@entity20 ( @entity1 , @entity99 ) - 90 minutes @entity100 might find it difficult to find a place in the @entity99 side if their stalwart left back continues this kind of form			2
@entity20 was imperious down the left hand side but he perhaps could have conceded a penalty in the first half as he grappled with @entity19 - showing some of the worrying frailties that he displayed at @entity112 last season			0
@entity15 ( @entity1 , @entity16 ) - 61 minutes could be considered lucky to even be on the pitch for as long as he did after appearing to aim an elbow at @entity45 in the first half			1
@entity15 has been a frustrating figure for many @entity16 fans this season and he showed why against @entity3			1
the @entity30 have experimented with pairing @entity15 with @entity28 or playing the latter alone			1
@entity15 's inability to combine with his strike partner upfront for @entity1 was one of the reasons they struggled to create much in the first hour of the game			1
@entity1 looked much better when he was withdrawn for goalscorer @entity126			0
battle : @entity15 has to fight off the attentions of @entity129 as @entity1 seek to break down @entity3 bad boy : @entity15 was substituted by @entity131 as @entity1 went in search of a winner - which they found speed merchant : @entity61 loanee @entity26 uses his pace to get him around @entity99 's @entity20 war : @entity26 comes out on top in this challenge with @entity28 , with @entity19 looking on @entity13 ( @entity3 , @entity61 / @entity140 ) - 90 minutes looked strong in the centre of defence against one of the @entity5 's most effective offensive sides			1
while he seems unlikely to get a chance at @entity61 , @entity13 could be in line for a @entity7 loan after a successful spell at @entity140 last season			0
@entity45 ( @entity3 , @entity61 ) - 90 minutes the @entity61 man was his usual self in the heart of midfield , keeping things ticking over and playing the unglamorous simple passes that are often under - appreciated			0
while he usually plays slightly further forward for his country , @entity45 returned to his withdrawn role to combat @entity1 's runners from midfield			0
he found himself in the right place at the right time to clear off the line in the second half			0
his backheel on @entity59 was brilliant			0
@entity26 ( @entity3 , @entity61 / @entity164 ) - 88 minutes @entity26 came into the side in place of the injured @entity167 but struggled to make an impact			0
his clearance off the line with the score at 0 - 0 was brilliant though , and not something you would usually expect from the flying winger			0
he was unlucky to see his curling shot deflected by @entity52 as @entity3 tried to grab an equaliser			0
@entity19 ( @entity3 , @entity177 ) - 90 minutes @entity19 has always been known as a bit of a troublemaker - and he was one of @entity3 's brightest sparks , using his space to cause problems for the @entity30 backline			1
he slammed one shot which @entity39 did well to save but could n't quite make the breakthrough for his side			0
we 're through : @entity15 might have had a poor game but he celebrates with @entity190 rival @entity39 here on top : @entity76 gets above three fellow @entity7 players to punch the ball away clash : @entity52 tries to stop @entity61 's @entity45 in his tracks as both sides struggled to create			1

@entity1 and @entity3 started five and four @entity7 stars respectively
@entity15 fails to impress upfront *alongside* @entity28
@entity16 striker was subbed as @entity1 searched for a winner
@entity13 *helped* @entity3 to keep the @entity30 at *bay* for periods
@entity26 and @entity45 both cleared shots off the line
@entity7 's @entity212 contingent drop out after 2 - 0 defeat
@entity15 , @entity32 , @entity20 , @entity52 and @entity39 advance to the quarter finals
