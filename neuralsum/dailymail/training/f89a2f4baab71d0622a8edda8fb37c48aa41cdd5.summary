by @entity0 from @entity1 to @entity2 and from the @entity3 to @entity4 , some villains , regardless of their horrific crimes , become folk heroes in the eyes of the public			0
another such folk hero – or heroine – is @entity12 , whose supposed deeds as a highwaywoman have been fictionalised in two films , both called @entity17 – the 1945 classic with a bosom - heaving @entity19 , and a 1983 remake starring @entity21			1
now the house that is said to have been the base from where the @entity24 held up coaches – @entity27 , in @entity28 , @entity29 – has come on to the market			1
wicked house : the 11 bedroom ' home ' of legendary @entity12 , @entity34 , in @entity28 , @entity29 , will be sold at auction in @entity36 this month fittingly , even its sale is cloaked in intrigue			1
it was initially priced at £ 4 million , and agents @entity41 received an offer of £ 4.25 million			1
but to ensure it gets the best price , the @entity45 listed manor house is now being put up for auction in @entity36 at @entity49 , only a stone ’s - throw from the start of @entity52 , the long , old roman road upon which the @entity24 is said to have committed her crimes			1
@entity12 was born in @entity29 in 1634 , heir to a considerable fortune , but her father died only six years later			1
her mother remarried but died herself two years after @entity12 ’s father			2
@entity12 ended up being cared for by the family of her stepfather and was married off to his nephew , @entity63 , when still only 13 ; he was 16			2
the story goes that the marriage was a disaster , with @entity63 boring @entity12 and things supposedly coming to a head at @entity34 one evening when his sister , whom @entity12 detested , came to dinner			1
notorious : lady @entity12 has been chronicled in two films , both called @entity17 , in 1945 starring @entity19 , left , and a 1983 remake starring @entity21 , right magnificent : the @entity45 listed 11 bedroom manor house in @entity29 comes with 79 acres of parkland and two cottages - if you 've got a spare £ 4.25million the meal over , the sister went home and @entity12 made as if to go to bed , but instead climbed through a hidden partition to a secret chamber , pulled on buckskin breeches , cloak , mask and a tricorn hat , and jumped on her black horse to set off for @entity52 , where she robbed her sister - in - law of her jewellery			1
that was just the start of the legend of the @entity24			0
flame - haired , with beautiful green eyes , she is said to have hooked up with @entity97 , a handsome local farmer by day and a highwayman by night , who brought her the excitement her marriage lacked			0
sadly for @entity12 , @entity97 was soon caught and hanged , and from then on she became increasingly bloodthirsty – burning houses , slaughtering livestock and even killing a constable			2
eventually , she , too , was killed			0
having been shot on @entity104 near @entity105 , she tried to get back to her secret stairway at @entity34 , but was found dead in a pool of blood at the foot of the east wall of the house the next morning			2
dating from 1145 , the imposing property was initially a priory for @entity115 nuns before being converted into a manor house in 1539			0
the @entity12 family took it over in 1547 and it was largely rebuilt in 1825			0
long history : the impressive property was initially a priory but was turned into a manor house in 1539 although records show that @entity27 was definitely owned by @entity12 ’s family in her lifetime , local author and historian @entity123 points out that there is no concrete evidence that she ever lived there			1
in fact , when she died , aged 26 , she may have been living in @entity36			0
mystery surrounds how the @entity24 story developed over the centuries but the tale was the subject of a 1944 novel by @entity138 – and that story formed the basis of the first @entity24 film the following year			0
what is certain is that the @entity143 sold off @entity12 ’s inheritance and land in 1655 , giving her ample motive to go in search of booty			2
and her view of her husband as a despicable skinflint also has substance : @entity153 described @entity63 as a ‘ rascally fellow , without a penny to his name ’			0
today , if you stand in @entity27 ’s long , curving drive overlooking its 79 acres of parkland , it is easy to imagine thundering horses galloping under a full moon			1
inside , the reception rooms are laden with period features			0
a @entity166 oak staircase leads upstairs to the 11 bedrooms , and one , in the eastern wing , is said to have been @entity12 ’s			2
it was here , in the 1800s , that workmen discovered a secret chamber			0
sadly it was empty – they found no tricorn hat , mask or breeches			0
however , it is still possible to make out the false wall abutting the chimney stack which conceals that hidden chamber			0
the question remains , why was it built ? @entity27 , along with its two cottages in 79 acres of parkland , is to be auctioned by @entity188 at @entity49 , @entity36 , on may 29			1
the reserve price will not exceed £ 4.25 million .			1

the life of @entity12 was turned into @entity17 films
her *rumoured* ' home ' , @entity34 , in @entity28 , @entity29 , is for sale
@entity34 , along with its two cottages in 79 acres , will be sold at auction
the reserve price on the 11 bedroom manor will not exceed £ 4.25 million
