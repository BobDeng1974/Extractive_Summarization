@entity0 have turned down the chance to sign @entity2 twice in the past year , with the most recent opportunity arriving earlier this month			1
the @entity5 winger is on the brink of joining @entity7 in a deal that could be worth in excess of £ 60 million , a figure that will shatter the @entity12 transfer record			2
it is understood that the @entity15 player has been offered to @entity7 ’s rivals in both of the last two transfer windows			0
@entity0 , however , have not been interested in pursuing a move over the last year and a well - placed source told @entity29 that the club were ‘ never in for him ’ this summer			0
they are also attempting to remain within the restrictions of @entity33 ’s @entity34 restrictions and such a deal may have negated @entity0 ’s capacity to recruit in defence and midfield , which was felt to be a priority			0
hot shot : @entity2 could be bound for @entity7 in a transfer said to be worth more than £ 60 million new man in : the arrival of @entity26 to @entity5 has made @entity2 's place in the side less secure they decided they did not need to strengthen in the forward positions in this window and declined the chance to sign the @entity53 finalist			1
@entity7 are expected to complete the deal in the coming week and @entity2 will be offered the no 7 shirt , famously worn in the past by @entity57 and @entity58 , at @entity59			1
it ’s not too late to play @entity61 … there ’s £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager			0
