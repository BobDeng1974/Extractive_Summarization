veteran @entity0 is facing homelessness with his and young family after @entity3 told him he was not eligible for accommodation furious veterans have criticised the prime minister and a local council after a war hero , who was discharged from the army because he had cancer , is facing homelessness with his wife and four children because he was told he was not eligible for a council house			1
@entity0 spent 15 years in the army - completing tours of @entity16 and @entity17 and also serving as a guard to the @entity19			1
but after the 34 - year - old developed a brain tumour he was medically discharged from the army last year and relocated to live with his young family - including his two - year - old daughter - in @entity25			1
he still has part of the tumour in his head that medics were unable to remove			0
however he has since been told he will not be allowed a council house and will be turfed out of his temporary accommodation in just four weeks - after @entity3 refused to give them a permanent home			1
the decision does not comply with the @entity35 , introduced by the prime minister in 2011 , to support members of the forces who have left the army to ensure they are supported and not disadvantaged - particularly if they have been injured			0
in an open letter to mr @entity46 and @entity47 , leader of @entity3 , veterans from the @entity42 in @entity43 and @entity44 , said they were ' angry and incensed ' by the decision			1
the letter said : ' this is not acceptable treatment for one of our brothers who has served his queen and country with impeccable professionalism for over 15 years , and who would have completed 22 years of service , given the opportunity			1
' it calls on officials to reverse the decision to ensure that mr street , his wife @entity61 and their children are not rendered homeless because of a ' ridiculous red tape issue			1
' mr street ( top right ) , his wife @entity61 ( centre ) and their four children face being left without a home mr and mrs streets were told they would be moved from their temporary accommodation within a month after their housing bid was turned down			1
they did have a private landlord but moved out because they could n't afford the rent and were given a temporary home			1
but because they left the private rental voluntarily they have been accused of intentionally making themselves homeless and have been denied any other accommodation			2
mrs @entity90 said : ' my husband is a proud man and did n't want bailiffs and the police turning up at the door so we did the honourable thing but in the council 's eyes that was not the right thing to do			0
they say we have made ourselves intentionally homeless			0
' they are throwing me , my husband and four children out on the streets so we are going to be homeless - who do we turn to ? ' mr @entity0 spent 15 years in the army and would have served for 22 years had he not been medically discharged after suffering a malignant brain tumour mr and mrs streets have four children - @entity109 , two , @entity111 , nine , @entity112 , 13 and @entity113 , 15			1
their problems started when @entity116 suffered an accident and was diagnosed with a brain tumour			1
mr @entity0 served 15 years in the army - first in the @entity120 where he went to @entity16 and @entity17			1
when he returned in 2008 , he took up ceremonial duties with the @entity122 , but it was after being thrown twice from a horse that he was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour			1
he underwent surgery which left his speech affected and with no movement in his left side			0
after four weeks in hospital and rehabilitation he returned to work			0
however , a seizure suffered a year later led to the end of his @entity136 career as he was medically discharged in may 2014 - against his wishes			1
mrs @entity90 added : ' @entity0 wanted to serve 22 years in the army and we had planned to buy our own home , but it did n't happen that way			2
he adored his job - he was army barmy - but he lost it through medical reasons			0
' are we expected to walk the streets with our four children ? the kids are worried and it 's putting a big strain on us as a family			0
' since he was discharged from the @entity136 mr @entity116 ' payments have dwindled because he has been unable to find work			2
he has received his driving licence back , after the @entity156 took it away because if his seizures and has enrolled on a plumbing course - hopeful of finding work			0
a spokesman for @entity161 said it did not comment on individual cases but said they may provide temporary accommodation until housing can be found			2
he said : ' it is important to understand that being provided with temporary accommodation by the council is not a guarantee that permanent council or housing association accommodation will be offered			2
' the @entity42 of @entity43 and @entity44 have also launched an online petition calling for action to prevents mr @entity0 and his family from being left homeless			1
a government spokesman said they would be looking into the case ' urgently			0
' he told the @entity179 : ' we changed the law so that seriously injured serving personnel and former servicemen and women with urgent housing needs must always be given top priority			0
' dear sirs , we are ex soldiers representing the @entity188 and need to tell you how very angry and incensed we are with @entity3 and @entity190 this weekend			2
yes i know you are all busy spending tax payers ' money on lavish lifestyles ( @entity195 ) and dishing out foreign aid , however , we have some serious issues on our own doorstep that are not being resolved			0
it has come to light that one of our colleagues and fellow @entity202 , @entity203 , who was medically discharged from the @entity136 in 2014 with the @entity204 ( @entity205 ) , is to be evicted from his council house along with his wife and four young children in one month by @entity3			1
their application for a permanent council house was rejected due to some ridiculous red tape issue			0
maybe he would stand a better chance if he was a foreign refugee or asylum seeker			0
perhaps @entity3 , and its leader @entity47 have n't heard of the @entity35			2
and perhaps it would be courteous of @entity190 to reply to @entity0 's letters sent via email , one on the 9th and the other on the 20th january , 2015			0
i also hear that @entity224 mp for @entity25 , @entity225 , was unable to offer any plausible assistance			0
veterans have said they are ' incensed ' by the treatment of war hero @entity0 and called upon @entity46 to act so he and his family are not made homeless by the council 's decision let me tell you about @entity0			1
he joined the @entity136 in 1998 at @entity233 initially with @entity234 , where he completed two tours of @entity16 , one in 2000 and the other in 2001			2
later in 2001 , he rebadged to @entity120 as a @entity238 based at the armoured regiment in @entity240			0
in 2007 , he was deployed to @entity17 on @entity241 for a 6 month tour as a @entity243 ( t ) reconnaissance crew commander			0
after returning from @entity17 , @entity0 volunteered for ceremonial duties at @entity245 , where he was a troop @entity205 , and carried out a wide range of duties including but not limited to @entity249 , trooping of the colour , state visits and @entity253 escort			1
@entity0 was involved in a riding accident where he was thrown from his horse and smashing his head off a fence , suffering from serious head injuries which resulted in a malignant brain tumour			1
he underwent surgery which affected his walking and speech and left him with no movement in his left side , he also contracted @entity265			0
but after four weeks in hospital with rehabilitation , at @entity268 , he returned to work			0
however , @entity0 suffered a seizure the following year which later led to the end of his @entity136 career			1
he was medically discharged in may 2014 , against his wishes			2
@entity0 still has part of the tumour in his head , as they were unable to remove all of the cancer cells			2
the family moved to @entity25 , the children were enrolled at local schools and they moved into their private rented accommodation			1
since then , his @entity136 funds have dwindled as @entity0 , 34 , has been unable to find work			2
the @entity156 has returned his driving licence and he has enrolled on a plumbing course with the hope he can support his family again			0
but in the meantime , they are facing the prospect of being homeless			0
why ? i speak for all veterans of the @entity120 and wider military family when we say that this is not acceptable treatment for one of our brothers who has served his queen and country with impeccable professionalism for over 15 years , and who would have completed 22 years of service , given the opportunity			1
we implore you mr @entity46 and mr @entity47 to act now to ensure @entity304 and his family are given appropriate housing so they can get on with their lives and bring up their children in a safe environment			2
yours sincerely , @entity311 & @entity312 & @entity313 1600 the @entity42			0
