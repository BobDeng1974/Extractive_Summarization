if @entity3 bikes are n't enough exercise , a @entity1 design firm has proposed a new way for @entity1 commuters to get to work - by swimming			2
the ' @entity8 ' would create a special commuter lane in @entity10 , which spans @entity1			1
the idea , developed by design firm @entity12 , has already won second prize in a prestigious contest organised by the mayor of @entity1 , and the firm now hopes to attract funding to make the project a reality			2
the lidoline , created by design firm @entity12 , would allow commuters to swim to work across @entity1			2
during the winter a thin membrane would be placed along the route , allowing it to freeze easily and making it safe to ice skate one			1
' we thought that another new open space was a little redundant - the problem is those spaces are underused , ' said @entity32 of @entity33 , which developed the idea			1
' we would create a network to link those areas together			2
' the obvious thing was the @entity10 - it runs through @entity1 , but is sporadically used , and is rarely used in its entirety			1
' creating a commuting network would allow people to reuse the canal , and they could be taken to work while highlighting underused places of @entity1			0
' the idea came second to a scheme to transform the disused ' @entity46 ' tunnel under @entity47 in @entity1 into an urban mushroom garden lit at street level by sculptural glass - fibre mushrooms in a recent @entity52 / mayor of @entity1 / @entity54 competition			0
the route would stretch from @entity56 to @entity57 stations along the route could also be used as open air cinemas in the evening , the team behind the lidoline claim			1
the judging panel , which included @entity73 and @entity74 , co-founders of @entity64 â€™s @entity63 , dr @entity65 , director of @entity67 , @entity66 , head of design for @entity1 , and leading landscape architects @entity70 and @entity71 also selected a runner - up and three highly commended designs from the 170 entries			0
however , the team behind the @entity79 said they are hopeful it could still happen			0
' we would love to take it further if we can find the energy and the funding			0
' it 's sensibly ambitious , there are plans for a floating pool in @entity89 , and it would be great if we could even realise a short stretch of it			0
' larger pools could also be created along the route to boost swimming across @entity1			1
grandstands and viewing areas could be built for swimming contests and cinema showings .			0

the @entity8 would follow the route of @entity10 , with ' stations ' used as open air cinemas in the evening
*concept* could be used for ice skating in the winter *months*
