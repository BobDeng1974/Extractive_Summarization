@entity0 , a former @entity1 spy services chief , now lives in a two - storey pink house in a @entity4 suburbs with his family during the height of his tenure as @entity1 's notorious ' torturer - in - chief ' he was feared by his victims , subjecting them to electric shocks and vicious beatings			1
but now @entity12 , the former head of @entity1 spy services , has allegedly forged a new life in @entity15 , where he is said to occupy a pink , two - storey stucco house in a quiet @entity4 suburb			1
@entity12 , now in his early 60s , was once a key figure in the @entity1 war - ' a big wheel in a machine that ground up a lot of people ' , the @entity19 reports			1
in @entity26 he ran the spy services operations following the @entity29 - led invasion in 2001			1
how he left behind that brutal career in @entity1 and landed in @entity4 - in an area that is said to remind him of the dry heat and landscape of @entity26 - is unclear			1
@entity12 was able to bypass immigration barriers faced by @entity1 whose work for the @entity29 made them potential targets of the @entity38 , the paper reports			1
despite links to the @entity29 intelligence services , the @entity40 denied aiding his entry			1
he was among a group of @entity45 who were chosen to try and seize the @entity38 stronghold , and had previously been involved in @entity40 - backed efforts to oust @entity50 forces			1
@entity12 , whose real name is @entity52 , went on to lead the @entity53 ( @entity53 ) , which was funded by @entity29 intelligence agencies and faced allegations of human rights abuses			1
new life : @entity12 , then an @entity1 intelligence chief , is in sunglasses to the right of @entity1 president @entity61 in 2002 a secret memo from 2007 named @entity12 as the main culprit behind the the @entity53 's ' systematic ' torturing			2
it said he was ' personally involved in conducting beatings amounting to torture , in detaining suspects illegally and arbitrarily and in deliberately and systematically evading detention monitoring			2
' his methods were said to include sleep deprivation for as long as 13 days and would suspend inmates from the ceiling with handcuffs			0
some claimed his extreme tactics even pushed neutral @entity1 towards enemy factions			0
however his supporters have said his job was crucial to the protection of the city			0
in the @entity15 community he now allegedly calls home , @entity12 is said to be surrounded by a network of @entity1			2
the front yard of his @entity86 property has a locked gate , is surrounded by a white fence and has citrus trees scattered around it			0
@entity91 , who attended school with @entity12 in the 1960s before moving to the @entity15 in 1979 said : ' we see each other every weekend , we play cards together			2
' ' his position was a cruel position so he did cruel things , but he is not like that			0
' he claimed the former officer arrived with more than a dozen of his relatives			2
similarities : the former intelligence chief is said to be fond of the @entity4 suburbs because it reminds him of the landscape surrounding the city where he grew up conditions : he is also said to like the ' dry heat ' at his new home because of its likeness to @entity26 ( pictured ) @entity112 : retired general @entity113 stopped prison transfers to the @entity53 because of fears over human rights abuses since he has settled in the community , he is said to have learned little @entity118 and is unemployed			1
@entity119 said he lives with a number of children , ranging in age from toddlers to someone in their twenties			0
since he has moved , the @entity126 have begun a more comprehensive investigation into the methods used by the @entity53			2
@entity129 general @entity113 suspended prisoner transfers to the security service after reports of abuse , and said the organisation relied on torture as an institutional ' reflex '			0
during his time as a leading intelligence official , he was said to have operated under a ' culture of impunity ' because of his link to international organisations			0
the @entity38 tried to kill him on numerous occasions and supporting factions tried to remove him from his post			0
he was nearly fired twice from the @entity53 , after @entity146 tried to persuade the then head @entity147 to fire him			0
but the orders were not followed because of ethnic politics and he was subsequently promoted and ended up in charge of the main prison in @entity152 .			0

@entity12 would subject victims to electric shocks and vicious beatings
now has moved to a @entity4 gated community with his family
intelligence officer , now in his 60s , likens area to ' dry heat ' of @entity26
@entity166 said to have run intelligence operations after 2001 @entity29 - led invasion
@entity40 has said they had no involvement in bringing him back to the country
