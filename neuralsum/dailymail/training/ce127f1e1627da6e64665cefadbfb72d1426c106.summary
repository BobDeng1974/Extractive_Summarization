@entity0 has created some mean running machines such as the ostrich , which has a top speed of 60mph ( 97km/h )			2
and while robots are not quite at the point where they could beat some animals in a race , scientists have created an incredible running machine with six rotating legs			1
taking inspiration from the natural world , the @entity11 is self - balancing and can reach speeds of 20mph ( 32km/h ) on different terrains			1
it will be the first commercially available running robot design : the robot is biologically inspired and is self - balancing			1
legs : it has between six and 12 legs			0
price : the @entity30 model costs $ 299 ( £ 177 ) and the performance model $ 799 ( £ 473 )			1
top speed : the @entity30 reached 10mph ( 16km/h ) and the @entity33 ( 32km/h )			2
operation : either remote control , or a smartphone app for the @entity37			2
battery life : one hour for the @entity30 and two hours for the performance version			2
height : the core measures 1.5ft ( 46cm ) and the performance is slightly larger at 2ft ( 60cm ) weight : 3lbs ( 1.4kg ) for the @entity30 and 5lbs ( 2.3kg ) for the performance			2
camera : both have the option to mount a camera and the @entity37 comes with an hd camera built - in			1
created by scientists at @entity51 , a spinoff of the @entity53 ( @entity53 ) in @entity54 , @entity55 , the robot claims to be the world ’s first legged running robot that is commercially available to the public			1
the company is raising money on @entity61 to put the robot into production and said : ‘ there is simply no other robot with such capabilities and so easy and fun to play with			1
all you need to do is just press the accelerator and steer it wherever you want it to go ; it 's that easy			2
’ it is biologically inspired and emulates the behaviour of legged animals by reproducing their step pattern as well as having a similar mass to length distribution , the company explained			1
‘ by having a centre of mass lower than the leg axis of rotation , @entity11 robots exploit a buoyancy effect , making them inherently stable and eliminating the need for expensive sensors and complex control algorithms , ’ they said			0
it claims to be energy efficient as the legs are used as energy storage systems , which allows for the conservation of kinetic energy during running			2
the robotics team proved the stability of the robot by creating a version that is able to run on four rotating legs			0
to steer the @entity11 , an owner uses a remote control to shift the mass of the robot by forcing it to lean to one side			0
this induces a turn , similar to steering a bicycle			0
the robot is available to pre-order in two versions : a core model for $ 299 ( £ 177 ) and the ‘ performance ’ model for $ 799 ( £ 473 )			1
both are expected to be shipped in mid- 2015			0
the core version will have a top speed of 10mph ( 16km/h ) and a battery life of one hour			0
it will come with six legs and a camera mount and will be able to be operated using a remote control unit			0
taking on mother nature : the robot ( pictured ) is biologically inspired and emulates the behaviour of legged animals by reproducing their step pattern as well as having a similar mass to length distribution , the company explained			1
here , it runs on six legs coming soon : the robot is available to pre-order on @entity61 in two versions : a core model for $ 299 ( £ 177 ) and the ' performance ' model for $ 799 ( £ 473 )			1
both are expected to be shipped in mid- 2015 measuring 1.5ft ( 46cm ) tall , the commercial robot will weigh less than 3lbs ( 1.4kg )			0
the more expensive performance model is twice as fast and uses a powerful out - runner brushless motor			1
its battery will last for two hours and users will be able to choose how many legs it has – from six to 12			0
they will be able to use a remote control or their smartphone to steer the machine , which has an on - board accelerometer , gyroscope and hd camera			1
data from sensors and video footage will be streamed to a user ’s smartphone using a @entity159 connection and hardware updates will be available to boost the robot ’s performance			1
it measures 2ft ( 60cm ) tall and weighs 5lbs ( 2.3kg )			0
the firm plans on organising a competition for its running robots by the end of 2015			0
all a blur : to steer the @entity11 , an owner uses a remote control to shift the mass of the robot by forcing it to lean to one side			0
this induces a turn , similar to steering a bicycle			0
here , the machine runs fast so the landscaoe appears blurred			0

@entity51 's @entity19 is self - balancing and can reach speeds of 20mph ( 32km/h ) on different terrains
it 's said to be the world ’s first legged running robot that is commercially available - and is available to order from @entity61 from $ 299 ( £ 177 )
robot is biologically inspired and emulates the behaviour of legged animals by reproducing their step pattern
comes in two versions : the performance model will be controlled by a smartphone and will *include* an *onboard* @entity197 camera
