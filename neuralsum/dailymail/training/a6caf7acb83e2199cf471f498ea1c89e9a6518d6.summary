by @entity0 published : 09:48 est , 1 may 2013 updated : 09:49 est , 1 may 2013 if you 've ever left your sunglasses on the beach or in a taxi , help could be at hand			0
designers have revealed the first pairs of @entity10 printed glasses frames - and say soon we could be able to simply print a replacement pair at home			1
@entity17 - based 3d printers @entity15 has begun making sunglasses frames for designer @entity20 's new eyewear line , @entity21			1
@entity22 , a company based in @entity24 , produces 3d - printed frames that cost around £ 115			1
these ' pixelated ' frames are designed to look like @entity28 bricks the frames made by @entity15 are printed in the closed position			1
slashes , like shark gills , are added where the hinges should be to make them open , and sit securely on the wearer 's head @entity22 , based in @entity24 , even prints a range of glasses that appear as if they 're pixelated			1
the @entity41 frames start at £ 115 , and the company is working on producing tailor - made frames using precise facial measurements			1
the @entity20 frames from @entity15 do n't have hinges and are instead made of a single piece of nylon			1
they cost £ 36 to make , and retail from between £ 400 and £ 900			0
be warned though , if you 're thinking of printing these frames at home , you will need to pay for a specially designed machine that will set you back around £ 150,000			1
the @entity15 frames are designed to be built , or printed , in the closed position			1
a series of slashes , similar to gills on a shark , are cut into the frames at the point where a traditional hinge would go			2
this means the glasses stems can be pulled apart in order to allow the glasses to be put on the head			1
when the glasses are removed from the 3d printer , the material memory of the @entity68 means the stems revert back to the closed position			2
and this means they sit securely on the wearer 's head			2
@entity68 stands for @entity75 and is the process of using lasers and powder to create layers of nylon that fit together to form a solid model			0
tests by @entity15 have found that the frames can be opened and closed more than 500,000 times before the stems start to loosen			2
@entity75 ( @entity68 ) is a relatively new way of @entity10 that uses a laser to fuse , or sinter , powder - based materials together			2
the powder is put together in layers to form a solid model			0
the printer system has of a laser , part chamber , and control system			0
the powder is put into a cartridge in the part chamber , and leveled out by a leveling roller			0
how @entity68 printing works a thin layer of material is spread onto the platform and the laser traces a two - dimensional cross section of the part			2
it then fuses the material together			0
the leveling roller pushes material from the powder cartridge across the platform , where the next cross section is sintered to the previous			0
this continues until the part is completed			0
once the model is complete , it is removed from the part chamber and finished by removing any loose material and smoothing the visible surfaces			0
layers and strips of material are built and fused together using a 3d printer to complete the finished frames dozens of different - styled glasses can be printed at the same time using 3d printers , see left , and @entity75			1
a close - up of what this process looks like is pictured right @entity15 say it can make 25 pairs of the glasses every 36 hours			1
3d printing is still a relatively new technology , and printers are still expensive			0
it can be used to print anything from chocolate , to jewellery , building materials , spare mechanical parts , and even other 3d printers			0
tests are also being carried out to see if @entity10 could be used to print human tissue , and car manufacturers have also experimented with printing replacement parts and panels .			0

frames can be printed without hinges , or made to look like @entity28
tailor - made glasses will soon be printed using precise head measurements
