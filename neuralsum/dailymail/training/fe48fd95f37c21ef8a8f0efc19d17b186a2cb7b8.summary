@entity1 manager @entity0 says he is working making sure his players are ' comfortable being uncomfortable			1
' the @entity1 squad are training at @entity4 in @entity5 where they hoped to get some warm weather ahead of the @entity7 in @entity8 next month			1
but it has not been as hot as they had hoped meaning @entity0 and his coaching staff have turned to other methods to get the squad used to the temperatures they can expect at the tournament			1
video : scroll down to watch @entity0 talk about training and transfers fully involved : @entity0 takes a hands on role in training man in the middle : @entity0 took charge of the open training session in the @entity27 man on a mission : @entity0 is looking forward to leading @entity1 to the @entity7 plenty to smile about : @entity0 says he is pleased with his young squad the players are training in extra layers as they try and replicate playing in the heat of @entity35			1
@entity0 said : ' the weather is the weather ; you never know what you are going to get with weather			1
‘ the weather is only part of what we wanted here ( to @entity5 )			1
we wanted the facilities , we wanted to be away from @entity1 together in a foreign country			0
‘ we wanted to come to a country where there is at least a good chance that the sun will shine , because it will shine in @entity8			1
‘ but we were n’t 100 per cent dependant on that because we were going to prepare the players to be , as the sports science people have termed it , comfortable with the uncomfortable			2
‘ and that means playing in temperatures that make you feel uncomfortable			0
‘ but even if the weather got colder here , all we would do is put more clothes on and make them feel uncomfortable that way			2
‘ today the players were pretty anxious to take their tops off when they were given permission to do so because they were beginning to sweat a lot and feel uncomfortable			2
' @entity0 has not suffered any fresh injury setbacks as he prepares the players for next friday 's warm - up friendly against @entity68 at @entity69			1
@entity71 defender @entity70 is also recovering well from a shoulder injury and the @entity1 boss hopes he will be involved before the squad return home			2
he said : ' the first three days have gone as well as i could possibly have hoped for			0
but there 's a long way to go and three more days to get through but we 've made a good start			0
' we had a slightly unfortunate incident with @entity82			0
he twisted his knee very slightly in training but it 's nothing serious			0
all wrapped up : @entity1 players warm up during a training session in @entity88 do @entity89 keeping warm : the @entity1 players all wore tracksuits and extra layers to get used to playing in the heat ' he could have trained but we decided to leave him out because it 's so early on and we do n't want to take any risks			1
' it was nice to see @entity70 joining in the warm - up			1
he 's training very very well and it looks like he might be taking part even before the end of this week			0
' @entity0 feels the competition for places in the squad , which will be reduced to a confirmed final 23 before @entity1 head to @entity8 , has ensured the players take their training especially seriously.but while relaxation is not an option , he insists he is leading a ' happy ' camp			1
@entity0 added : ' we do n't talk about relaxation , or about sessions being light - hearted or serious , we talk about the job that we need to do and we expect that every time the players go onto the training ground that they are 100 per cent following what we think needs to be done			1
good hands : @entity121 in action during training at full stretch : @entity125 dives to make a save in training ' if they happen to enjoy it then that 's a major bonus but we do n't set out to make it enjoyable , we set out to do the work that we think is absolutely necessary if we 're to have any success at this @entity7			2
' @entity0 made some tough calls before revealing his first selection - his decision to include @entity139 teenager @entity138 instead of 107 - time international left - back @entity140 was hotly debated			1
he believes that fierce scrap for places on the plane has helped focus his players ' minds sharply on the task in hand			0
at full speed : @entity150 and @entity151 run during training getting stuck in : @entity153 and @entity154 fight for the ball in training ready to go : @entity154 , @entity157 , @entity151 , @entity158 and @entity159 all take part in training drills ' i think they 're excited to be selected and i think everyone realises that my choice was a difficult one , ' @entity0 added			2
' it was n't just a case of taking the only players that were there , there were more players than these who could easily have come so i think there was a lot of tension among players before i made my selection as they waited to be chosen			0
' so in this camp of course there 's a lot of enthusiasm but they 're also happy that they are taking part in this incredible adventure and that they 're the ones who are going to be leading @entity1 over the next few weeks			0
' @entity189 , who at the age of 18 broke on to the international scene with four goals at the 2004 @entity193 , has failed to impress at the last two @entity194			0
affection : @entity189 kisses his son @entity196 before @entity1 training good to see you : @entity196 runs towards @entity189 and the @entity1 striker picks up his son big things are expected from the @entity71 striker in @entity35 , but should he flounder at the tournament then @entity0 insists it will not be ' for the want of trying '			1
he said : ' he knows what a good player he is , he knows the eyes , certainly of @entity1 , if not the rest of the world , are going to be on him and he 'll do everything he can to make certain he brings out his best qualities			0
' he spent his week off here in @entity5 and he trained during that time			2
he said to me , ' when you arrive on monday , i 'll meet you there and i want to be 100 percent ready to train from the first day '			0
' he 's a bit disappointed because i decided to leave him out of the exercise i was doing , which involved a lot of shooting , because i wanted to protect his thigh			0
' if it had been up to him , he 'd have been in it having as many shots as all the others			0
