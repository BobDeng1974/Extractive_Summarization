just moments after he 'd been celebrating @entity2 's 10 - star performance in the live @entity3 on sunday , @entity0 was back in the thick of it			1
thinking he was immune from facing a challenge for at least another day , the former @entity6 man was shocked when asked to take part in a bonus trial for an extra treat			0
reluctantly , the 36 - year - old followed @entity2 's lead and faced the @entity13 - part two			0
in reference to one of @entity0 's previous tasks involving snakes , host @entity21 joked : ' that last snake did n't like you ... it 's not the same snake			2
' to which his partner - in - crime @entity30 quipped : ' but they 've been talking to the other snake ! ' surprise : @entity36 explain to @entity0 just exactly what he will have to do in the @entity13 @entity38 : @entity2 who sailed through his challenge gives @entity0 a bit of moral support nervous : the tension builds as @entity0 confronts his ' worse nightmare ' - snakes building courage : @entity0 waits nervously for the klaxon to start the one minute long trial despite the luxury of having two attempts at the trial , @entity0 cried : ' this is a bad one for me			1
this is probably my worst nightmare			0
i 'm not sure about this situation			0
' but the former footballer bravely agreed to give it a go as he stepped into a glass cube where there stood a small box containing three pythons			2
it 's in : the footballer manages to get his hand into the glass box after much coaxing he proceeded to creep his hand through a tube into the box where he had to pick up six coloured tiles that were under the snakes			1
failing his first attempt , @entity0 swallowed his fear and went back for more , this time completing the challenge with time to spare			1
by the looks of his celebrations it was as though he 'd won the @entity76 , @entity78 title and @entity79 all in one go .			0

@entity0 took part in a surprise @entity84 aired on monday
the former footballer had to *plunge* his hand into a box filled with snakes
@entity90 *successfully* completed the task with time to spare
