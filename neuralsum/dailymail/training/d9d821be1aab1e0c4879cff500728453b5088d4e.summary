published : 14:18 est , 4 november 2013 updated : 18:12 est , 4 november 2013 the first onesies were derided as little more than a romper suit for adults			0
made of cotton or polyester , the cheap fleecy suits were certainly warm and convenient for those unashamed to be seen looking like a supersize toddler			0
however , they moved from the bedroom and lounge to become a feature of the high street , both as urban fashion statement and fun fancydress			1
the luxurious onesie is made of pure cashmere wool , is available in black or grey and costs £ 199 now , @entity19 has created a luxury version in cashmere wool in time for @entity21 , which comes with a price tag of £ 199			1
it describes the cashmere version , which comes in black or grey as the ‘ epitome of luxury ’ and boasts ‘ this sumptuous cashmere onesie will keep you snug and stylish from head to toe ’			1
the word onesie can be traced to the @entity33 baby goods manufacturer @entity34 where it was used as a brand name to describe an all in one suit for toddlers			0
this ad campaign , shot by @entity40 , was met with a mixed feelings from the public and press - and has n't translated into any kind of sales lift			2
in fact , sales are down for clothing @entity49 ( left ) and @entity50 ( right ) star in the new @entity21 advert , which goes online this evening @entity50 modelling her first ever lingerie collection called ' @entity55 ' designed in partnership with @entity19 - it has proven the store 's most successful underwear range ever the giant baby - grows were originally marketed as a thermal sleep - suit for adults , however they have become something of a fashion phenomenon over the last six years			1
sales have taken off thanks to the endorsement of celebrities , with everyone from @entity70 list stars like @entity71 to tv presenters @entity73 and @entity74 , boy band @entity76 and olympian @entity77 , seen wearing them in public			0
just as shell suits were worn by millions during the 1980s , so the onesie has come to define the fashion tastes of the current generation			0
the shell suit faded from use after it was associated with what became known as the chav classes			0
@entity19 hopes that its popularity will last – at least until @entity21			2
the company will be releasing its latest sales figures on tuesday amid @entity91 speculation that sales of its women ’s fashions have not seen the turnaround expected			2
this will be a blow to the chain , which spent £ 5million on a new advertising campaign , featuring a cast that included @entity102 and @entity103 , to promote its well - received autumn collection .			1
