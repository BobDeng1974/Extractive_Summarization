by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 07:38 est , 20 may 2013 updated : 05:49 est , 21 may 2013 @entity3 held talks with the billionaire head of @entity6 yesterday but failed to tackle him over allegations the giant corporation has dodged hundreds of millions of pounds in tax			1
@entity10 attended the meeting in @entity12 as a member of the prime minister ’s elite @entity14			1
but the @entity6 boss , who has an estimated fortune of £ 5.5billion , left by a back entrance , apparently in a vain attempt to avoid photographers			0
in and out : @entity6 boss @entity10 arrived for a top level meeting with @entity3 through the front door of @entity23 , but later left via the back entrance all smiles : mr @entity10 ( centre ) seemed relaxed as he stepped from his car after being driven into @entity12 mr @entity3 had given a presentation on his plans to use next month ’s @entity30 in @entity31 to agree a global crackdown on tax havens and corporate tax avoidance			1
but sources confirmed that he did not confront mr @entity10 directly over reports that @entity6 paid only £ 10million in corporation tax in the @entity38 between 2006 and 2011 , despite revenues of £ 11.9billion			1
senior @entity42 peer @entity40 said last night that it was extraordinary that the prime minister had failed to tackle mr @entity10 over @entity6 ’s alleged tax avoidance , and called for him to be sacked from his advisory role			1
‘ how can @entity3 possibly not see how outrageous it is to keep mr @entity10 on his business advisory group when @entity6 is making a mint and paying pennies in tax in @entity38 ? ’ he said			1
last week @entity6 vice president @entity52 was questioned by @entity53 over the firm ’s policy of processing @entity38 deals through the @entity57 , where corporation tax is lower			1
silence : mr @entity3 briefed his @entity14 on his clampdown on tax avoidance but did not challenged mr @entity10 over revelations about @entity6 's low corporation tax bill @entity64 , chairman of the public accounts committee , accused the company of ‘ devious ’ behaviour			1
at the weekend , a whistleblower claimed @entity6 had used an ‘ immoral ’ tax avoidance scheme to avoid hundreds of millions of pounds in tax			0
‘ every time they switch on to @entity6 ... it reminds them of your rather devious , if i may say so , calculated and in my view unethical behaviour in deliberately manipulating the reality of your business to avoid paying your fair share of tax to the common good ? how do you think ordinary people feel ? ’ referring to the ‘ do n’t be evil ’ slogan , mrs @entity64 added : ‘ i think you do do evil			1
that is , you use smoke and mirrors to avoid paying tax			0
’ former @entity6 executive @entity86 said he was willing to hand more than 100,000 emails detailing a ‘ concocted scheme ’ to avoid tax to @entity90			2
@entity6 said mr @entity10 had attended yesterday ’s meeting in a ‘ personal capacity ’ , adding : ‘ @entity6 pays the corporate tax due on its @entity38 activities and complies fully with @entity38 law ’			1
a source said mr @entity10 had indicated agreement with the prime minister ’s strategy of trying to hammer out a deal to set international rules on tax that would make large - scale avoidance much harder			1
yesterday ’s meeting came hours after @entity106 president sir @entity105 warned mr @entity3 to stop ‘ moralising ’ to business about tax			2
he accused politicians of using the tax affairs of well - known corporations such as @entity6 , @entity113 and @entity114 as a ‘ political football ’			0
sir @entity105 , who later attended the meeting of the prime minister ’s @entity14 , said tax avoidance ‘ can not be about morality - there are no absolutes ’			2
meanwhile , mr @entity3 has written to the leaders of offshore tax havens stressing the need to get their houses in order as he pushes for international action to tackle avoidance schemes			2
business secretary @entity130 backed ' public outrage ' at multi-national firms like @entity6 and @entity114 who use legal but ' unethical ' means to avoid paying tax			1
however , the prime minister ’s officials spokesman said he would not comment on companies or individuals , despite once branding the comedian @entity141 ’s tax avoidance as ' morally wrong '			0
@entity6 vice president @entity52 floundered during the grilling by @entity53 , admitting that committee chairman @entity64 knew more about his firm than he did ahead of the meeting @entity12 made clear mr @entity3 would not raise @entity6 's tax affairs			1
‘ the prime minister will be taking the group through his @entity30 agenda			0
tax and tax transparency are at the heart of that , ’ the spokesman said			0
asked whether the pm will specifically raise the concerns about @entity6 's tax arrangements , the spokesman said : ‘ we do n't talk about individuals ' or individual companies ' tax affairs			1
‘ what the prime minister will be doing at that meeting today is explaining the tax transparency part of the @entity30 agenda which he has been discussing with other @entity30 leaders and will discuss again at the @entity166 this week			2
‘ he certainly is going to raise tax and reform of global tax rules including the ones under which multi-nationals operate			0
he is going to raise that with the entire @entity14			0
‘ when it comes to companies , companies should pay their tax			0
’ mr @entity3 will set out in detail the work which the @entity38 has been doing in partnership with @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183 on automatic exchanges of tax information			1
while refusing to challenge @entity6 , the @entity149 has written to the leaders of @entity38 's offshore tax havens stressing the need to ‘ get our own houses in order ’			2
last year @entity6 paid only £ 7.3million in corporation tax on more than £ 3billion in @entity38 sales in a message to 10 crown dependencies and @entity38 overseas territories mr @entity3 said he backed their right to be low tax jurisdictions but insisted that rules needed to be set and enforced fairly			1
he said he wanted the @entity30 to ‘ knock down the walls of company secrecy ’ to reveal who really owns and controls firms			0
the prime minister 's letter calling for more transparency about tax information and the ownership of companies was sent to leaders in @entity210 , the @entity211 , the @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 , the @entity216 and @entity217 , @entity218 and the @entity219			2
mr @entity3 wrote : ‘ as you know , i have made fighting the scourge of tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance a priority for the @entity30 which the @entity38 is hosting next month			2
‘ with one month to go , this is the critical moment to get our own houses in order			0
i am looking to all the overseas territories and crown dependencies to continue to work in partnership with the @entity38 in taking the lead on two critical issues : tax information exchange and beneficial ownership			0
’ he told the leaders : ‘ i respect your right to be lower tax jurisdictions			0
i believe passionately in lower taxes as a vital driver of growth and prosperity for all			0
‘ but lower taxes are only sustainable if what is owed is actually paid - and if the rules to achieve this are set and enforced fairly to create a level playing field right across the world			0
there is no point in dealing with tax evasion in one country if the problem is simply displaced to another			0
