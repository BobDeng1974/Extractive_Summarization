by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 03:06 est , 15 november 2012 updated : 09:35 est , 15 november 2012 @entity3 striker @entity2 last night scored the ‘ greatest goal ever ’ to round off a crushing victory over @entity6 in the first match at his national stadium			1
the talented footballer 's remarkable overhead kick came when he was 30 yards from goal			1
he sprang six feet into the air to arch the ball over the helpless goalkeeper and into the net			2
the world 's biggest football names are already queuing up to praise the goal , with even @entity6 's gobsmacked stars hailing his achievement as ' extraordinary ' and ' world class '			1
' the best goal i ’d seen before that was @entity53 ’s against @entity54			1
' everyone knows how special that was , but this one — an overhead kick from 30 yards when the ball is six feet in the air — only certain players can do that			2
and he is a special player			2
‘ this was a world - class performance from a world - class player			1
' @entity65 's goal was his fourth of the match , taking the score to 4 - 2 to round off the first game at @entity70 in @entity44			1
pure delight : @entity3 's captain celebrates his outrageous fourth goal of the friendly , with the world praising the sheer audacity of his remarkable propeller kick @ rioferdy5 what a goal @entity80 @ @entity82 words can describe that goal @entity84 @ @entity86 dear ! one of best goals i ’ve ever seen @entity89 @ @entity90 was obscene			1
what a goal @entity92 @entity93			1
. @entity2 enjoyed it too ... ‘ when i saw the keeper was out of his net , i tried to put it over him			2
it was a good try , and when it comes off it ’s fantastic			2
’ the propeller kick came after goalkeeper @entity32 had come out of his area to head the ball clear			0
silence fell as those inside the arena held their breath			0
and watched the flight of the ball			0
then the noise exploded as it landed in the net			0
even @entity6 supporters stood to applaud the audacity of @entity3 's captain , thrilled to witness such a brilliant flash of sporting beauty			1
@entity2 ripped off his shirt , tossed it towards the crowd and shrugged as he was shown a yellow card			0
asked to rate his international career out of 10 , @entity2 replied : ‘ ten			0
when i saw the goalkeeper was out of his net , i tried to put it over him			0
it was a good try , and when it comes off it ’s fantastic			0
’ former @entity6 manager @entity130 said : ‘ that ’s the greatest goal i ’ve ever seen			1
’ @entity6 manager @entity132 , who suffered his first defeat over 90 minutes , said : ‘ @entity2 ’s fourth goal was extraordinary and it put the tin lid on the game			1
it was a fantastic goal			2
' but it was the second and third goals which killed us			0
' for 60 - 70 minutes we played very well and deserved to be leading			2
there are lots of reasons to be optimistic			0
’ opener : @entity145 fires @entity3 into the lead after 20 minutes - but @entity147 and @entity148 put @entity6 ahead before half - time hat - trick hero : @entity2 curls home a free kick to put @entity3 in front again in the final 14 minutes , and his fourth goal was then the icing on the cake @entity3 's star man famously once said : ' @entity157 ( then @entity159 manager ) drove me like a @entity161 ... i am a @entity162			1
' it was a typical comment from a man who , despite his doubters , has never been short of confidence in his own ability			0
and while @entity2 's performances against @entity170 clubs in @entity171 have often fallen short of his high standards ( before last night he had scored just four goals in 1,556 minutes against @entity170 clubs and @entity6 ) his wider statistics mark him out as one of the best players of his generation			1
he is the only player to have scored for six different clubs in the @entity180 , and up until last season he had won eight consecutive league titles ( @entity183 03/04 , @entity184 04/05 , 05/06 , @entity185 06/07 , 0708 , 08/09 , @entity159 09/10 and @entity186 10/11 )			0
and a number of managers and chairmen have recognised his talent - he has cost a combined total of £ 150m in transfer fees			2
but missing from his cv is a @entity180 victory and honours at international level			0
until those blanks are filled - though playing for @entity3 makes the latter unlikely - doubts about his greatness may remain			1
but certainly not in his own head			0
@entity3 substitute @entity201 said : ‘ it was @entity2 against children			1
he has been criticised in @entity6 and this proves them all wrong			1
’ the @entity3 player became the first footballer to hit four in a match against @entity6			1
no - one had even scored a hat - trick against @entity6 since @entity210 in 1988			1
the two @entity6 goals came after @entity2 opened the scoring in the 20th minute , with @entity147 and @entity148 taking the national side to a half - time lead			1
the excitement was abruptly cut off in the last 14 minutes , however , when @entity2 scored three more and went down in history			0
overshadowed : @entity6 captain @entity49 , appearing for the national side for the 100th time , jostles with @entity2 on the pitch before praising the player 's skill after the match historic moment : the @entity224 press lauded @entity2 as ' incredible ' as the footballer covered the front pages the debate as to whether @entity2 's goal was the greatest ever will rage long and hard - but it is certainly up there with the best			1
but here are a few other spectacular overhead kicks that are vying alongside it to be recognised as the best ever			0
@entity233 , @entity159 v @entity234 , @entity235 , june 17 , 2001 @entity159 went into the last game of the season needing a win to qualify for the @entity180			0
with two minutes to go , the score was 2 - 2 , with @entity240 legend @entity233 having scored both @entity159 's goals			1
then as the home side poured forward the ball was again chipped into @entity233 as he stood on the edge of the box with his back to goal			2
two touches later - one with the chest , one an acrobatic swing of the right boot - and the ball had nestled into the bottom corner and @entity159 's place in the following season 's @entity180 was assured			2
@entity255 , @entity257 v @entity256 , @entity258 , january 25 , 1997 ask any fan of @entity257 - and a large number of other supporters - and they will tell you the greatest goal that will ever be scored came from the right foot of @entity255 back in 1997			1
the flying winger met a looping cross from the right a full 20 yards from goal with an acrobatic overhead kick that flew into the back of the net after the game @entity255 reported : ' i try them all the time in training but they ’ve never come off like that			2
' it was such a good strike that it beat @entity280 ’s goal from the halfway line against @entity282 to be crowned @entity283			1
@entity53 , @entity284 v @entity54 , @entity285 , february 12 , 2011 just 13 minutes were left with a disappointing @entity287 derby poised at 1 - 1			2
@entity288 swung in a cross that looped up off the back of a @entity54 defender			0
waiting underneath it was @entity53 , who leapt up , arched his back and executed the perfect scissor kick into the top corner			0
' i think so , ' said @entity53 when asked if it was the best goal of his career			2
' i saw it come into the box and thought " why not ? " ' thankfully it finished up in the top corner			0
i was trying to get in a good position for when @entity288 crossed it			0
nine time out of 10 they go over the crossbar			0
today it ended up in the top corner			0
’ @entity310 , @entity311 v @entity312 , @entity313 ( from the film @entity315 ) the @entity316 went 4 - 0 down in the first half before pulling a goal back on the stroke of half time			1
@entity310 , who the @entity321 had succeeded in kicking off the park , roused himself for the treatment table to help the team 's cause			0
and it was the @entity327 superstar who completed one of the greatest sporting comebacks in cinematic history			0
with the score clawed back to 4 - 3 and the clock ticking down @entity310 sprayed the ball wide to @entity335 who took it down on his chest before standing up a cross into the box			1
@entity310 , holding his damaged arm to his chest , leapt into the air swung up his right boot and made it 4 - 4			1
cue celebrations and a sneaky escape thanks to the @entity313 crowd			0

his fourth goal of the night was hailed as ' world - class ' and ' extraordinary '
@entity3 beat @entity6 4 - 2 in the first match at their national stadium
