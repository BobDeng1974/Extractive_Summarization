by @entity1 reporter @entity2 is set to track the world 's warships and make the data available to billions of internet users , raising concerns over the security of the @entity10 naval fleet			1
the search engine plans to offer the coordinates and identity of virtually all vessels at sea on @entity16 after spending around $ 3million on satellite technology			1
the company continues to consult with the @entity19 over the plans , as well as with the defence departments of countries around the world			2
@entity2 has claimed that it is better placed to track the military boats than most governments			1
ship - shape : @entity2 will soon be able to show the location of every vessel at sea and maps of the ocean floor @entity32 , who is chief technology advocate at @entity33 , told @entity34 : ' i watch them and they ca n't see themselves			1
it angers me as a citizen that i can do this and the entire @entity39 ca n't			2
' @entity2 is not the first to track ships at sea , but claims to have improved on previous technology			1
all large vessels are fitted with the @entity44 ( @entity45 ) - a series of transponders that transmit the boat 's position to avoid collisions when it is dark or there is bad weather			0
at the moment @entity45 can detect boats 20 mile away from each other - however , there are ongoing attempts to improve the distance and accuracy			0
by comparison , from space the @entity2 satellites can detect ships anywhere			1
the web power has already used its technology to track trawlers fishing illegally in foreign waters and passed the information on to governments			2
despite fears over a risk to defence ships , the vessels can go incognito by simply turning off their transmitter so military operations were unlikely to threatened			2
all at sea : internet users will be able to locate the coordinates and identity of the @entity19 's fleet via a simple @entity2 search detractors of @entity2 's plan to map the waters said the technology could be used by terrorists or pirates to attack ships			1
however one military source responded : ' it 's not the ships you can see , but the ships you ca n't see that matter			0
' @entity2 's plan to map the ocean floor over the next five years could reveal the resting place of spy satellites and send hostile foreign enemies on the hunt for ' sunken treasure '			1
it 's not the ships you can see , but the ships you ca n't see that matter			0
military source @entity16 was launched in 2005 , providing aerial or satellite images for most populated areas across the world			0
the service has often been controversial			0
@entity111 threatened to sue the company yesterday over dropping the name of the @entity114 on @entity16			0
the threat came after it left the body of water between @entity111 and the @entity118 nameless on its online map service			0
@entity121 spokesman @entity120 said that if @entity2 does not restore the name of the @entity114 , it will face ' serious damages '			2
into the deep : @entity2 has said its capabilities of tracking naval vessels outstrips defense departments @entity2 reacted to the comments , saying that its maps service had never labelled the @entity114			1
when asked by @entity131 if @entity2 planned to include the title in the wake of @entity111 threats , a spokesman said there were no plans to include the title on any amended map			1
a separate company insider told @entity131 that it was ' definitely not ' a political decision not to have @entity114 on google maps , and @entity111 's assertion that @entity2 had had the label removed was ' simply wrong '			2
@entity111 are highly sensitive about the name of the body of water , which has historically and internationally been known as the @entity114			0
some @entity148 states insist on calling it the @entity150			0
the issue has stirred up tensions between @entity111 and @entity148			0
