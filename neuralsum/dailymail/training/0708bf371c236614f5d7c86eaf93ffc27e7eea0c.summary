an urgent review of stealth speed cameras has been ordered to determine if they should be painted yellow , roads minister @entity0 has said			1
it was reported last month that the devices - dubbed ' stealth cameras ' by critics - have caught almost 700 drivers in just two months on the @entity9 in @entity10			1
unlike traditional speed cameras , the gantry devices are painted grey , making them harder to spot for drivers			1
mr @entity0 said : ' i have been concerned about " stealth cameras " and have ordered a review as a matter of priority to look at exactly where they are , what they are being used for and how they are signed , ' @entity33 reported			1
' i think it 's important that people know where speed cameras are			1
the suggestion that stealth is involved is not reasonable			2
' transport minister @entity0 ( pictured ) said the suggestion that speed cameras were using stealth to catch motorists was ' not reasonable ' the technology uses front and rear - facing cameras to verify a vehicle ’s speed			1
and , while conventional devices have to be trained on only one lane at a time , the digital cameras can scan four			2
they are similar to cameras used during roadworks but do not work on the basis of calculating an average speed over a fixed distance			2
the camera technology is being introduced on a northern section of the @entity9 and also parts of the @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26			0
motoring groups claim the devices will see thousands of drivers facing at least £ 100 in fines and points on their licence for straying marginally over the 70mph limit			0
