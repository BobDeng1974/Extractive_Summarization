on one occasion ms @entity22 said she and other customers had to wait while staff built makeshift steps out of cardboard boxes so she could put in her pin			1
the @entity4 settled with her and has now brought in devices that can be handed to customers in hundreds of branches across @entity32			1
ms @entity0 , who is just over a metre tall , told the @entity33 : ' it was really embarrassing , because there was a very large queue of people behind me			1
' i just wanted to be able to put my pin in like everybody else and post a letter and to withdraw cash , and i was n't able to reach the machine and it was n't able to be passed to me			2
' so staff were improvising random steps out of cardboard boxes , and it was really quite humiliating			1
' ms @entity0 , who played a minor role in @entity1 and starred alongside @entity49 and @entity50 in 2001 film @entity13 ! , claimed for disability discrimination because of the @entity4 's failure to make adjustments to their machines so she and other people her height could use them			1
' the design was less flexible than in other shops			0
in places like @entity62 , @entity63 and my bank the pin machines are held in a holster			0
they also have a broader range of movement because they are on a flexible tether , so can be handed to the customer , ' she explained			0
' when i shop most places , i am usually handed the pin machine by shop staff , so i can privately enter my pin			0
' unfortunately , i had several negative experiences at post office counters and for many years i have had difficulty paying for their goods and services			0
after a couple of really upsetting experiences at various branches , i realised , something needed to change			0
