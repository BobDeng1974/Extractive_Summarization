even though little @entity5 is undergoing grueling chemotherapy and radiation treatments for her inoperable brain tumor , she could n't stop thinking how lucky she was to be going to @entity9 through the @entity10			1
determined to help other children have their last wish granted , the @entity12 , @entity14 resident decided to spread her own personal motto , ' you might have a bad day today but there 's always a bright star to look forward to tomorrow , what 's your bright star ?

her mother told her about @entity35 , in which the retail giant donates one dollar to the @entity10 for every hand written letter it receives to @entity39			1
contacting @entity40 , a family friend and charity worker , a social media campaign was begun on @entity43 that spread at an astonishing rate around the @entity46 and smashed through @entity5 's goal to get 10,000 letters sent to @entity26			1
the letter 's came from as far away as @entity50 - all arriving at a special center set up by @entity40 in @entity52			0
@entity5 with her mother @entity53 and father @entity54 - the brain tumor she is suffering from causes her to lose some muscle control in her face @entity5 spoke at a mall in @entity14 to explain why she wanted to help raise the money for charity the nine - year - old who describes herself as ' almost ten ' will travel to @entity9 in the spring and fulfill her dream they doubled that number within the first ten days and just before christmas day , a spectacular 240,983 letters had been sent by children inspired to believe in @entity68			1
in addition to the near $ 250,000 that they will now donate to the noted children 's charity , @entity26 will be giving an additional $ 25,000 in honor of @entity5			1
the happy - go - lucky @entity76 fourth grader was diagnosed with her rare and aggressive cancer three days before @entity78 but the brave girl began her amazing charity quest after telling her parents , @entity54 and @entity82 that she does n't like to ' get ' without giving something back			1
@entity5 's campaign resulted in enough funding to pay for 36 more wishes to be granted to seriously ill children			2
the ambitious girl announced her astounding target at @entity26 @entity90 on the 23rd of december and brought tears to the crowd with her candid speech			0
the letters arrived by the bag to the center in @entity14 which was set up to deal with the influx after @entity5 's campaign was put onto the internet eventually all the letter 's were packed onto a truck and taken to @entity26 's @entity90 mall ' @entity39 , i 'm @entity5 , the one with the tumor			1
@entity10 has really touched me , ' said @entity5 as she clutched a microphone			2
' i want to say one more thing , ' she added during her speech			0
' this is my motto and i think you should use it too			0
you might have a bad day today , but there 's always a bright star to look forward to tomorrow			0
' look inside what 's your bright star			0
' the generosity of the children has inspired and helped @entity5 through her arduous treatment and led to some touching letters to @entity39 with @entity68 wishes			1
' @entity39 , i have everything i need , just please cure cancer for @entity68 , ' is one letter that @entity40 says she has received			2
touching : this letter asks for @entity124 to find a cure for cancer for all the sick people and for girls to stop loving 1 direction and to stop talking about them this letter claims to not ask for much for @entity68 from @entity39 - but it still got @entity26 's to donate $ 1 to charity to help sick children @entity53 was touched too by the thoughtfulness of the children			1
' just the sweetness and the innocent of these children writing something down , ' said @entity53			0
' it was not about @entity139 , it was about expressing their needs and their desires and their wishes			0
' whatever holiday it is that you celebrate it 's just goodness and pure and what can we do to be kind to other people			0
' the family hope that the treatment that @entity5 is receiving will shrink and destroy the tumorl , which is the size of a walnut			2
one night recently , @entity5 's father @entity54 took the family out to buy a packet of walnuts which they lined up in the deck railing outside and together they smashed them with a frying pan and hammer			2
' @entity5 ’s tumor is pressing on some of her facial nerves , which makes it difficult for her to smile — but she still lights up the room wherever she goes , ' @entity40 said to the @entity170			2
the family hope to travel to @entity9 in the spring and when they do they hope to have heard from some of the families that they have helped see their wish come true .			0

diagnosed three days before @entity78 with inoperable brain cancer little @entity5 did n't think it was fair for her to get her wish to go to @entity9 without giving back
