neatly packed : khat traffickers coming through @entity8 airport have made little attempt to hide their gear packing it in bags right up to the brim @entity29 ( @entity29 ) is a plant from @entity31 which is chewed as a stimulant , provoking a feeling of euphoria			1
it is popular in a number of countries , particularly in the @entity38 , and its use in @entity2 appears to have grown substantially in the last few years			1
it has been banned in the @entity41 and most @entity43 states , including @entity10 , with @entity45 home secretary @entity44 announcing last month she would enforce a @entity45 ban on khat , effectively classifying it as a @entity49 drug			1
according to @entity52 , relatively small amounts of the drug were in the past found mainly in traffickers using the forests and back roads around @entity8 to cross the border			2
the natural stimulant has been banned in @entity10 and other @entity43 countries ; it is soon to be listed as a class c drug in the @entity45 the smallest amount they had seized was 1.48kg being brought into the country by a @entity10 resident , but now the largest haul recorded is 95kg			1
the find was picked up in the freight area of the airport where it was heading for the @entity41 , the news service said			0
the traffickers in @entity10 tend to be @entity74 who live in the @entity45 although more recently , customs officials have reported a trend in traffickers from @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 , according to the local news service			1
the natural stimulant tends to be sold by the ' box ' costing between £ 14 and £ 21 for around 200 grams			0
after the euphoric feeling subsides , it is said to be followed by a low , and subsequent passivity			0
the plant , which contains cathinone an amphetamine - like substance , is often harvested and flown in from the @entity38 among communities in @entity94 , @entity74 and the @entity95 , chewing the flowering plant has a long history as a social custom dating back thousands of years			1
but the leaves contain cathinone , an amphetamine - like stimulant that can be addictive			0
it has a molecular structure similar to that of amphetamines			0

in the @entity45 , mrs may has pushed for its ban , despite advice against the move by an official advisory body			0
the @entity122 ( @entity122 ) in the @entity45 reports that more than 2,500 tonnes , worth about £ 13.8m , was imported to the @entity45 in 2011/12 , bringing in £ 2.8m of tax revenues			2
@entity29 ' houses ' in @entity45 have been linked to terrorism , with police targeting those in @entity128 , @entity129 , amid fears they are recruiting grounds for @entity133 extremists			2
mrs may 's proposed ban means khat will be treated as a class c drug , like anabolic steroids and ketamine			0
trade : @entity74 families monopolise the export of khat to @entity2 in @entity143			1
they create links with @entity74 in @entity45 and send initial supplies based on trust workers : @entity143 labourers pack bunches of khat into banana leaves so they can be shipped to the @entity45 @entity152 : the export business is owned by @entity74 families who use @entity143 workers as they are cheaper			2
