by @entity0 follow @ @ laura_mail @entity1 has invited @entity2 to return to @entity3 as his assistant manager after admitting that letting the midfielder go was one of the most difficult acts of his career			1
the @entity3 boss praised @entity2 in the highest terms , saying he was the best all - round midfield player of the past decade			1
he also insisted the 35 - year - old ’s move away from @entity12 this summer is merely a ‘ little break ’ , not the end of his career there			1
@entity1 hinted that @entity18 ’s time at the club may not be over , revealing he has yet to talk to the left back about his future			1
job for life : @entity2 can return to @entity3 any time he wants , says @entity1 top dog : @entity1 also described @entity2 as the most complete all - round midfielder of the past decade @entity18 , 33 , is also out of contract but no official announcement has been made following the player ’s comment on @entity31 last month that he was ‘ weighing up his options ’ and ‘ sadly it does not look like @entity3 will be one of them ’			1
@entity2 , meanwhile , is considering a move to @entity37 in the @entity38 after leaving as @entity3 ’s all - time record goal - scorer with 11 major honours , including three @entity42 titles , four @entity43 , the @entity44 and @entity45			1
@entity1 said : ‘ you ca n’t imagine how difficult it was			2
i think only @entity2 knows that , but at the same time i can feel some happiness about the process because , for sure , he comes back to @entity3			1
mr @entity54 — the no 1 , the most important person — wants @entity2 to be back very much , i want him to be back and the staff want him back , so he comes back for sure			1
‘ he can come back the way he wants			0
mr @entity54 has left the door completely open for him on the understanding @entity2 can do anything he wants at this club			2
to repeat mr @entity54 ’s words , “ he can come back the way he wants ”			2
‘ he can be a coach , he can start at the academy , he can start being my assistant at the same time because he is doing his coaching badges , or he can start in a different role			0
‘ it ’s not the end of @entity2 ’s career in @entity3			1
it ’s just a little break			0
‘ he will be back , hopefully for many , many years , because he ’s one of the most important players in the history of @entity3			2
’ new boy : @entity3 are believed to have a deal lined up to sign @entity78 midfielder @entity77 fresh start : @entity2 is expected to sign for @entity37 side @entity80 after the @entity82 is over @entity2 ’s former manager acknowledged the midfielder ’s determination to continue playing for two or three more years , but said a footballer of his calibre needs to compete in a league where he is the ‘ top man ’			1
lampard completed only 11 @entity42 matches last season and @entity1 revealed he had advised him to give up international football after this @entity82 , having already won 104 caps			2
‘ @entity92 is the perfect way for somebody with more than 100 caps to finish his career in the national team , ’ said @entity1			2
‘ i told him , “ do n’t go more than the @entity82			0
@entity92 is the right moment to finish ”			0
to finish around 110 caps is a crazy number for an outfield player			0
he ’s not a goalkeeper that plays till 40 years of age			0
‘ he ’s a man to play a major role in a team , not like what happened in the last year			0
i think for him , for his mentality , for his personality , it ’s better to get a club and probably a competition where he is really the top man			0
‘ @entity2 is a no 6 , a no 10 and he wears the no 8 , because he is the six and the 10 and he becomes the eight			0
‘ for me , he is the best no 8 i have managed , for sure , and i do n’t see a better no 8 in the last decade			0
he was the best for 10 years			0
i do n’t see another one			0
’ thumbs up : @entity3 owner @entity54 would welcome @entity2 back to @entity3 with open arms @entity18 retired from international football after being left out of @entity122 ’s squad for @entity123 , but @entity1 said the defender was still in the ‘ perfect condition ’			1
the left back started only five @entity42 matches in 2014 after losing his place to @entity127 following a rib injury last autumn , but @entity1 said he pushed @entity18 towards the end of the campaign in the hope he would be selected for the @entity82			2
