the word soccer is actually a @entity4 term that comes from @entity5 , @entity1 historians have found			1
they were investigating the history of the word , and the cultural difference behind it			2
in fact , the use of the term goes back 200 years , they said			1
the word ' soccer ' comes from the use of the term ' association football ' in @entity4 and goes back 200 years , they said			1
according to the @entity22 the first recorded use of the word ' football ' in @entity21 was in 1486			2
the contemporary history of the world 's favourite game spans more than 100 years			2
it all began in 1863 in @entity21 , when rugby football and association football branched off on their different courses and the @entity31 in @entity21 was formed - becoming the sport 's first governing body			0
both codes stemmed from a common root and both have a long and intricately branched ancestral tree			0
' @entity1 have long referred to @entity5 as ' soccer ' , to the point where many people believe it is fact a word invented in @entity1 , ' wrote @entity42 professor @entity41			1
' many seek to associate @entity1 use of the word with alleged @entity1 imperialism and cultural hegemony			0
' the researchers found the word soccer in fact originated in @entity4 at the end of the nineteenth century , and was commonly used there			1
' it appears that as the popularity of soccer has grown in the @entity1 , the word has been used less and less			0
the paper analysed usage of the two words from 1900 , and found @entity4 people only stopped using about 30 years ago			1
@entity1 invented their own variant of the game that they simply called ' football ' in the early 1900s			0
when @entity21 won the @entity65 in 1966 the use of the term soccer was just beginning to decline in the @entity4 ' @entity5 ' became ' soccer ' in @entity1 , and what was called ' gridiron ' in @entity4 became simply ' football ' in @entity1			1
' since 1980 the usage of the word ' soccer ' has declined in @entity4 publications , and where it is used , it usually refers to an @entity1 context , ' the researchers say			2
' this decline seems to be a reaction against the increased usage in the @entity1 which seems to be associated with the highpoint of the @entity81 around 1980			0
' however , the researchers admit the problem of two names may need to be addressed			0
' with soccer growing in popularity in the @entity1 and the rest of the world stridently insisting the word soccer is not football , it would appear that some kind of resolution will eventually be required			0
