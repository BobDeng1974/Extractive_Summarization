by @entity0 for @entity1 and @entity2 prosecutors have said @entity5 's son - in - law should be sentenced to life in prison for his role as @entity10 's spokesman after 9/11 , when he made ' bone - chilling threats ' against @entity12			1
the @entity12 government has said a life sentence for @entity15 , who was convicted in march of charges that included conspiracy to kill @entity12 and providing support to @entity10 , would send out an important deterrent to would - be terrorists			1
prosecutors , who described @entity15 's words as ' inciting , murderous and hateful ' , said : ' terrorism is a crime with high recidivism rates and rehabilitation is notoriously difficult			1
