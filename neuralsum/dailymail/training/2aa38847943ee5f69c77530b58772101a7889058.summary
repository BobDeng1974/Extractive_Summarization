a grown man who has spent thousands feeding his @entity3 obsession loves dressing up as the make - believe horses			1
@entity5 , 34 , from @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 , is part of a legion of male fans who openly adore the cartoon - a group so large they even have their own nickname ' bronies ' , from ' bro ' and ' pony '			1
he loves watching characters such as @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 cantering across his screen every week			2
@entity5 , who is currently single , admits he knows people will laugh at his obsession but insists it does n't bother him			1
he said : ' i always knew people were interested in the show - i was kind of ignoring it because thought it was a show for girls			1
' but i was ignorant			2
it was n't until after i watched it i realised they were going for more general focus			2
' i 've been into cartoons for as long as i can remember			2
i have so much in my apartment my friends and family are n't surprised any more			0
' i just roll with it			0
if people try to make me look bad and get a laugh then i gave them a laugh they did n't have			0
i 'll laugh with them			0
the it consultant has filled his home with memorabilia from plush toys to full body costumes after the encounter with an army of bronies at @entity63 he immediately took to the camaraderie ' it 's just an interest like any other hobby - we are just a group of guys getting together sharing a common interest			1
' @entity5 first became a fan of the show in 2013 after being asked to help at @entity26 - the biggest male @entity73 convention in @entity8			1
and after the encounter with an army of kindred spirits he immediately felt at home with the camaraderie and common interest of the group			0
he added : ' i met a bunch of people in the community and realised they were a lot of fun to be around			0
' plus it turned out i liked the material more than i thought i would			0
the show was fun but the whole package is what sealed the deal			1
' a lot of meet - ups are drinking parties - people do n't realise as this is an internet community			1
' but we all found this weird thing online so why not get together and have fun			0
' i do travel for it			0
@entity100 , @entity101 , is the furthest i 've been but there is one in the @entity104 and @entity105 too for example			0
' it seems like there are more and more brony conventions popping up every single month			1
' ironically , @entity5 says even though an ex-girlfriend attempted to convert him he never liked @entity3			1
he says if he met a girl and she wanted him to give it up - then he could but now he has taken to the show he insists it does n't stop him meeting other women			1
he said : ' i used to make fun of my ex for it - but she must have shown me a few episodes i did n't like			2
' it was a surprise i ended up getting into it			0
if i met another girl and she wanted me to give it up then i could as it 's an interest not a lifestyle			2
' however if someone were to ask me to give up a piece of myself i would n't want to be with them anyway			0
' @entity5 admits he knows people will laugh at his obsession but insists is does n't bother him @entity3 was a hugely popular children 's franchise in the @entity131 and @entity132 but its fandom became elevated to a new level when a new cartoon reboot premiered in 2010			1

i do n't go for the super rare , expensive stuff ; more the vinyl collectables , card games and a few plush characters			0
' i have a pretty substantial collection from the trading card game which i have almost every card and am known for			0
' my front room is full of @entity3 figures but they look good so i 'm going to keep them there			0
