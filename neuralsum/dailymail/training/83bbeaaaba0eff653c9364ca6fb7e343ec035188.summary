tuesday night was the most shocked i have ever been in a football stadium			2
and i was not alone			2
all the @entity3 fans near our @entity5 commentary position were stunned , too			1
there was not much anger — i think that will follow in the coming days — just quiet horror			2
everywhere i ’ve gone in the past few weeks i ’ve felt the locals ’ obsession with this @entity13			2
and as a visitor to the country , i ’ve bought into it			1
on tuesday , it seemed that the emotion of winning the @entity13 for the people and the furore surrounding @entity41 ’s injury was all too much for @entity17 ’s side			1
when you walk around cities in @entity3 you are just a couple of blocks from a favela , from seeing people sleeping and living in the streets , some of them missing limbs			1
the players were acutely aware of that			2
they felt they were playing for the people and there is so much emotion attached to that			1
rudderless : @entity29 was captain on the night but he showed no leadership skills as @entity3 collapsed off target : @entity29 resorted to trying to hurt his opponents as his side 's gameplan fell apart in @entity62 @entity29 really meant it when he said he felt he ’d let his country down			1
but sport is not about raw emotion , it is about being professional , about concentrating on the job in hand			2
yes , the crowd can be a 12th man , but , in @entity3 ’s case , the weight of the 12th man was too much to bear			1
there was no structure to their system and when you have a bad performance , you need to fall back on your system to avoid disaster			1
for @entity3 , it was like they had pulled the plug out of the bath			1
opposites : @entity87 celebrate but @entity29 is unable to lift his teammates as the scoreline worsens no way back : @entity90 and @entity91 stand in the centre circle - something they did all too frequently on tuesday night as if the emotion surrounding the tournament was n’t enough , the team had whipped themselves up into even more of a frenzy over @entity41 and @entity98 ’s absence			1
they wore @entity41 hats , left an empty hanger in the dressing room in @entity98 ’s honour and clung on to a @entity41 shirt during the national anthem			2
but you should n’t have to work yourself up for big games — if anything , you need to calm yourself down			2
the @entity87 are masters of that			0
it ’s fine to play for an absent player but not to the extent @entity3 did			1
their focus was in the wrong place			0
you ’re out there to play football and you must not think about the scale of it all until the game is over			0
too little , too late : @entity90 scored a consolation for the host nation in the dying minutes but it was pointless the signs were there against @entity127 in the quarter - final			2
as a kid i remember booting the ball into touch and getting told off : ‘ @entity3 would never do that , ’ my coach told me			1
well , they did against @entity127 and the crowd were applauding it			0
they were headless , unable to cope with the mass hysteria			0
and on top of that , the squad was simply not good enough			0
they are a million miles off the 2002 squad of @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148			0
but the fans and media still believed — they turned @entity29 into their new hero and it backfired			1
the fans wanted to win the @entity13 so much but i got the feeling they just wanted to be champions without having to endure the matches			0
support : @entity29 was keen to back his injured teammate but not so ready to do his job on the pitch they did n’t want to go the hard miles and every match just became an emotional ordeal			1
@entity17 must take a lot of the blame , too			0
last year , his team beat @entity169 to win the @entity170			0
they have gone downhill since			0
i ’m all for loyalty with your players but why did he keep playing @entity177 after an average season at @entity179 and @entity91 , when the rest of the world can see he is not good enough ? @entity17 would have been better off experimenting more last summer so he knew how to handle things when the injuries and suspensions came			0
and he was wrong to leave @entity185 out of the squad			0
he needed someone to calm the young players , to teach them how to behave			0
mentally shot : @entity3 were unable to cope with the emotions of the occasion as their @entity13 dream died @entity192 ' six minutes of nightmares ' - @entity17 there were n’t many yellow shirts out in @entity3 on wednesday			1
football is what @entity3 is most proud of			1
they have more than 800 professional clubs , export their players to the top leagues in @entity202 and yet they could n’t get an xi together to win the trophy on home soil			0
they are in a similar boat to @entity208 now — they have to rebuild and look at the good things that countries like @entity87 and @entity212 are doing			0
what a sorry end to their @entity13 .			0

hosts let themselves get *swept* up in the emotion of the occasion
@entity29 really meant it when he said he *'d* let his country down
professionals need to keep their heads - @entity3 did *n't*
poor @entity3 side had no system to fall back on , only passion
