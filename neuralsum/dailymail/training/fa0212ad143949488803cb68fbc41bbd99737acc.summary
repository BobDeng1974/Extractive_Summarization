scientists have for the first time captured a direct image of @entity3 , the structure that encodes the genetic instructions of all living organisms			1
@entity6 and colleagues from the @entity8 , @entity9 , developed a technique to capture the famous double helix of @entity3 using a scanning electron microscope			1
deoxyribonucleic acid ( @entity3 ) molecules encode the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living organisms and many viruses			1
the stuff of life : @entity3 's double helix is clearly visible in this scanning electron microscope image taken by an @entity9 research team using a new method to capture the hitherto elusive molecule along with rna and proteins , @entity3 is one of the three major macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life			2
previously the dna helix could only be detected using a technique known as x-ray crystallography , which involves scattering @entity35 rays off atoms in crystallised arrays of @entity3			1
capturing the reflected rays on photo film forms the now iconic fuzzy x inside a fuzzy @entity42 pattern that @entity43 and @entity44 used to discover the double - helix structure			2
however , because of the indirect nature of the image , @entity43 and @entity44 were only able to infer the existence of the double helix using complex mathematics to interpret the image			0
very , very small : a team from the @entity8 , @entity9 , captured dna threads out of a dilute solution and dried them and stretch them out across water - repellent nanoscopic silicon pillars now professor @entity56 and his team from @entity59 's @entity58 have used a scanning electron microscope to creat the first direct image of the dna double helix			0
the researchers developed a process to capture dna threads out of a dilute solution and dry them and stretch them out across water - repellent nanoscopic silicon pillars , @entity63 reported			0
by drilling tiny holes through the base of their bed of nano - nails and shining electrons through them , they were able to create high resolution images of a strand of @entity3			2
a stylised image of the double helix strands of dna : the structure of @entity3 was first inferred in the @entity81 using a technique called x-ray crystallography the remarkable image clearly shows the dna double helix , as predicted by @entity43 and @entity44 nearly 60 years ago			1
with refinement , the @entity59 team hope that their new technique will allow researchers to watch single molecules of @entity3 as they interact with other biomolecules			1
but since the electron energies are high enough to snap dna molecules , at the moment the method only works with ' cords ' of dna made of six molecules wrapped around a seventh acting as a core			0
professor @entity56 now hope to use more sensitive detectors that can detect lower - energy electrons			0
this should allow them to see individual double helices and even unwound single strands of @entity3			2
' with improved sample preparation and better imaging resolution , we could directly observe dna at the level of single bases , ' @entity63 quoted him as saying			0
the research was published in the journal @entity114 .			0
