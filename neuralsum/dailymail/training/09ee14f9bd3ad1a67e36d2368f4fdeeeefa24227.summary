the two @entity1 teenage girls who became ‘ poster girls ’ for jihad in @entity4 are now desperate to come home after getting completely disillusioned with their new lifestyles			1
@entity8 , 17 , and her friend @entity7 , 15 , who grew up in the @entity1 capital @entity10 , were persuaded to head to @entity4 and take part in the holy war in april			1
the girls had started lecturing schoolmates about their lifestyle and when they left @entity10 in april they left behind a note telling their parents : ' do n’t look for us			1
we will serve @entity20 – and we will die for him '			0
@entity21 is @entity8 , 16 , who is thought to have fled to @entity4 to join the @entity22			0
on the right is 15 - year - old @entity7 who went with her - the two are believed to now want to return home a photo posted on the girls ' social media accounts			1
doubts have now been cast regarding the authenticity of the picture - it 's thought pictures of other people have been posted to their social media pages once they arrived it is believed they were married off to local fighters and both the girls are thought to be pregnant			1
police in their homeland @entity1 say that the girls ' social media accounts were taken over and manipulated to broadcast what they now think were fake messages about the life they were having , and using them as poster girls to encourage other young girls to head to @entity4			2
but security service insiders have told @entity1 media that the girls have managed to contact their families to say they have had enough , and want to come home			1
however they warn that there is almost now no chance that they will be able to leave their new lives after they became internationally famous and the images were shared all round the world			0
@entity1 newspaper @entity1 , which revealed that the girls now wanted to come home , is known to have close connections to those investigating the disappearance of the two girls and is in close contact with their families			1
both sets of parents had been trying to find ways to contact their daughters and it is believed some way of communicating had been established			0
a picture purporting to be of @entity8 and @entity7 , which was posted online sometime after they fled @entity1 the paper said that the girls are currently in the @entity22 controlled city of @entity87 in northern @entity4 , had been married to @entity89 fighters upon their arrival in @entity4 and were both pregnant			1
spokesman for the @entity92 , @entity91 , said however that decision may be too late			0
he said : ' the main problem is about people coming back to @entity1			2
once they leave it is almost impossible			0
' the news comes despite reports which surfaced last month that one of the girls may have been killed			2
however , these reports were never officially confirmed and the @entity92 could not ascertain if they were correct			0
the motivations of the two @entity106 girls are unclear but before leaving , they had contact with @entity89 youths , and visited a mosque in @entity10 's second district			1
and police also expressed concerns that the pair were inspiring their contemporaries after two other teenage girls were caught attempting to flee the country to join is ranks			1
little information was given about the copycat pair hoping to join @entity22 apart from the fact that one was 16 and the other was 14 and their parents were apparently from @entity124			0
police now want to find out how they became radicalised , and whether anybody had helped them plan their trip to @entity4 which was apparently set to take place via @entity128 - following the same route as the other two girls			0
the pair were caught when the mother of a third friend who was supposed to be travelling with them became suspicious about the amount of luggage her daughter was packing			0
as many as 130 people from @entity1 are now believed to be fighting as jihadists abroad			2
more than half of @entity1 's jihadists originally come from the @entity142 and have a valid residence permit in @entity1 .			2

two teenage girls vanished from homes in @entity1 capital @entity10 in april
pair began to post pictures of themselves online with guns and armed men
now it 's believed the two regret their decision and want to return home
both thought to have been married to jihadists and are now pregnant
