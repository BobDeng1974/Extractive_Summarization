earlier this month the tracksuit tycoon @entity1 agreed to buy a plot of land in @entity4 from the retailer @entity6 for somewhere in the region of £ 200million			1
the @entity8 has been primed for redevelopment , with planning permission for 62 luxury flats , seven townhouses and an agreement to relocate @entity14 as part of the project			0
in five years , when the operation to build the properties is concluded and they have been sold to high - end buyers , @entity1 will add something in the region of another £ 1bn to his net worth			1
there have been empty seats at @entity26 recently as fans let their feelings about @entity1 be known the weekend defeat by @entity30 was a seventh straight @entity32 loss for the @entity33 toon keeper @entity34 had to pick the ball out of his net three times against @entity30 @entity1 looks after the money , obsessing over the finances at his business empire , which includes @entity40 , @entity41 and his football club in the north east			1
last year his group made more than £ 500m			0
in return , he expects his employees , across the board , to deliver			0
the biggest motivation in @entity1 ’s life is to make money , something reflected in @entity53 ’s latest accounts , which are showing another decent profit and £ 34m in the bank			1
the money men at @entity53 are already aware that the team could play in an empty stadium when the new television deals crystallise at the start of the 2016 - 17 season and still turn a profit based on current income and expenditure			1
it feels like it could come to that as @entity53 ’s disaffected supporters wonder where to take their grievances to next			2
@entity1 , the club ’s owner , does not appear to be listening			1
he is not a football man , certainly not in the same way as the increasing number of disillusioned supporters at @entity26			1
after seven straight defeats in the @entity32 under their interim coach @entity77 , they have every right to fear for the future			2
it does not help that @entity1 has taken a neanderthal approach to negative criticism , frequently banning journalists from @entity26 ’ because they have gone into bat on behalf of the team ’s disaffected supporters			0
for such a successful businessman , @entity1 ’s sensitivity to criticism is undoubtedly one of his biggest weaknesses			2
@entity1 ( right ) has never been mr @entity91 at @entity26 but the protests have been ramped up recently a fan appeared to have a go at interim manager @entity77 during the latest loss at @entity26 the view from the bench has n't been pretty for @entity77 and the @entity53 staff during the last few weeks he should address it because his ability to make money should be one of his most powerful weapons at @entity53			1
in january , after a deal had been concluded to take @entity106 to @entity107 , the former @entity53 manager gave a momentary insight into the financial strategy at @entity26			0
‘ @entity53 is a big club , it ’s difficult because it is run on an tight financial margin , ’ admitted @entity106			2
‘ we had to work hard on transfers , the funds for a club that size makes it difficult to understand that we had to build slowly			0
’ so what is so wrong with that , especially when the owner of the club still has an interest - free loan of £ 129m marked in the latest @entity53 accounts ? it is the job of @entity53 ’s chief scout @entity124 , along with his staff , to identify and recruit the players who can improve this team			1
talent identification is not @entity1 ’s area of expertise and he has always made it clear that it is the responsibility of his scouting department to improve the squad			0
the natural conclusion when clubs sell their best players , as @entity53 did when @entity138 moved to @entity139 in january 2014 and @entity140 left for @entity141 last summer , is to lose momentum			0
it always feels like a lack of ambition			0
then there are teams such as @entity147 , who sold four of their best players last summer - @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152 - for £ 88m after finishing eighth in the @entity32			2
@entity53 fans held a protest urging fellow supporters to ' show @entity1 the red card ' they responded by recruiting @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163 for an outlay of around £ 56m			1
under @entity165 , who replaced @entity166 last summer after he moved to @entity167 , @entity147 could still qualify for the @entity168			0
they are a fine example to the teams outside the top four because @entity147 ( with an annual income of £ 90m ) , @entity30 ( £ 84m ) and @entity53 ( £ 110m ) can not compete on the same financial terms			1
@entity30 , who beat @entity53 3 - 2 last saturday , have also had a recent change in management after promoting @entity176			1
he has had an outstanding year in charge			0
@entity180 fans held up the cards during the latest protest against owner @entity1 even with the loss of @entity184 , sold to @entity185 for £ 28m in january , they are on course for a top - eight finish because of their own financial prudence and some smart recruitment			1
like @entity147 , they are not living above their means , but their transfer policy is first class			0
they are being rewarded for that			0
@entity53 are currently 19th in the annual @entity196 report into football ’s rich list , but they do not have the same financial muscle as @entity201 ( £ 371m ) , @entity185 ( £ 277m ) , @entity4 ( £ 277m ) , @entity141 ( £ 219m ) , @entity202 ( £ 208m ) and @entity167 ( £ 153m )			2
this summer @entity1 will make some new signings , something they desperately need after a depressing end to the season at @entity26			2
without them , the balance sheet will be the only winner .			0

@entity53 have lost seven @entity32 games in a row
fans protested against @entity1 during the latest loss against @entity30
@entity1 does not appear to be listening - he is not a football man
his biggest weapon is ability to make money - club has £ 34m in the bank
