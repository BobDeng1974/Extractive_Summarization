in the same period , 49 @entity7 and @entity23 staff lost their jobs			2
mr @entity1 said : ' a large number of @entity3 employees were joining the workforce in 2009 at the same time that i was being made redundant			1
' i believe i could have done these roles			0
far more @entity30 employees have been selected for redundancy than @entity3 employees			2
' with regard to engineers , it should be noted that not a single @entity3 engineer has been made redundant , whereas 30 non-chinese have been			0
' the hearing in @entity38 , @entity12 , was told that mr @entity1 started working for the @entity3 firm in april 2006 but was made redundant in may 2009			2
mr @entity1 , who was born in @entity40 but became a @entity7 national after studying at @entity42 , @entity43 , in the 1990s , said no foreign workers were made redundant			1
he added : ' the human resources manager sent an email dated april 21 , 2009 , stating that expat employees are exempt from redundancy			0
' this is a clear racial discrimination against @entity30 employees as most expats are @entity3			2
' @entity52 guidelines state employers are not to treat migrant workers more or less favourably than resident workers			0
' i believe i have been unfairly pre-selected for redundancy and have been selected due to my age and race in that i am not @entity3			2
' mr @entity1 added : ' those who were made redundant were local engineers , some @entity7 , some of other nationalities			2
' @entity61 , a colleague of mr @entity1 , said @entity3 employees ’ poor spoken @entity62 made it impossible for them to speak to customers			1
he said : ' there were three rounds of redundancies in 2009			0
' on each occasion local engineers were made redundant and either expat employees - @entity3 migrant workers - or locally employed ethnically @entity3 engineers were not			1
' one @entity3 engineer i worked with spoke very little @entity62 , hence it made it extremely difficult for me to liase with him			0
mr @entity1 was the most senior engineer on his team at @entity2 before being made redundant			2

the whole company was affected by economic circumstances and changes in the organisation of their competitors			0

' in 2009 @entity2 unfortunately had to make a series of redundancies , resulting in 25 percent of @entity7 workers and 32 percent of @entity3 employees losing their jobs			1
@entity2 ’s @entity3 expat employees are subject to a separate contract and dealt with through a different process			1
the fact that a higher percentage of @entity3 workers than @entity7 were made redundant shows that @entity2 in no way prioritised @entity3 employees			1
