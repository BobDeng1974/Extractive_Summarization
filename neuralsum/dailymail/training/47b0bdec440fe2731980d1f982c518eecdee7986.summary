@entity0 put a brave face on it			2
‘ @entity8 was quicker today , all weekend , really , ’ he conceded after his team - mate @entity4 dealt another psychological blow in this season ’s title race			1
the deficit at the top after @entity0 's failure to finish in @entity12 was three points			1
that became 10 after he struggled with the balance of his @entity17 in the wet in @entity18			2
and he is in danger of seeing @entity4 extend his lead to 17 – perhaps even more – with only three races , after the inaugural @entity23 @entity22 , remaining			1
while the @entity24 , who secured his 38th career pole on saturday , appears to have raised his game , @entity0 has plateaued			2
he can not hide from his winless stretch which now stands at five races ; it has been 83 long days since he last took to the top step of the rostrum in @entity32			1
@entity0 congratulates @entity4 after he secured pole for sunday 's @entity23 @entity22 of course , there have been poles during the interim , in @entity37 , @entity38 and in @entity18			1
he also would have certainly challenged @entity4 in @entity12 after finishing just seven thousandths of a second shy of his team - mate in qualifying			1
yet his failure to convert any of those pole laps into victories has somewhat thwarted his chances of emulating father @entity46 and claiming his maiden championship win			2
it would be unfair and probably inaccurate , to say that the pressure is getting to the ice - cool @entity0			2
it would be daft , too , to write him off			0
but we should note that @entity4 has challenged for @entity55 championships before , in 2007 , 2008 and even in 2010			0
will those experiences benefit @entity4 ? only time will tell			0
but one thing ’s for sure , the title momentum is firmly in the @entity24 's favour and @entity0 must wrestle it back , starting with tomorrow ’s race in @entity62 , if he want 's to win this championship			1
@entity4 finished the session two tenths clear of @entity0 as he bids for his fourth straight victory it ’s been a dark week for all those concerned in @entity55 as @entity71 ’s life hangs in the balance after his horror crash in @entity18			1
the paddock has paid tribute to the stricken @entity76 with tributes adorned on crash helmets and cars up and down the pit - lane			0
and the @entity81 showed their support for the 25 - year - old with a computer - generated message displayed during saturday ’s qualifying session			0
the message was displayed on the exit of the final corner throughout saturday 's qualifying session ‘ @entity71 , we are all supporting you ’ was displayed on the exit of the final corner on the world feed which is controlled by @entity91 ( @entity91 )			0
rather poignantly an image taken from the side of @entity0 ’s @entity17 , showed both the ‘ @entity71 ’ sticker on his helmet and ' keep fighting @entity99 ' hashtag , in support of seven - times world champion @entity101 , on his car			1
saturday also marked the first anniversary of @entity105 ’s death which came as a consequence of the injuries the @entity109 racer sustained in a testing crash at @entity111 in 2012			0
@entity0 's helmet with the ' @entity114 ' sticker and keep fighting @entity99 hashtag on his mercedes @entity23 is hosting its first @entity91 grand prix and the ever - impressive @entity118 gave the home crowd something to cheer when he qualified a staggering fifth			1
it was a career best for the rookie , who has enjoyed a week to remember , after he was announced as @entity126 ’s replacement at @entity127 for 2015 ahead of the @entity18 @entity22			0
the 20 - year - old , who became the sport ’s youngest points scorer after he finished ninth on his debut in @entity132 , was a whopping seven tenths quicker than team - mate @entity134			1
@entity118 qualified a career - best fifth in front of his home crowd - the @entity23 has impressed this term @entity126 endured another difficult day at the office after he failed to progress to the top - 10 shootout for the fourth time this season			2
the quadruple world champion , who will join @entity144 to become the highest - paid driver in the sport ’s history next season , could manage only 11th			0
‘ it was n’t comfortable , so i am glad it looked like that , ’ said @entity126 when he was told it appeared as though he was battling his @entity127 during both @entity150 and @entity150			0
‘ we were too aggressive and i did not have the grip at the rear i wanted			0
i am unhappy that we did not get the best out of the car , ' a glum @entity126 added			0
@entity161 ’s grid penalty for a gearbox change sees @entity126 promoted to 10th for tomorrow ’s race , but it marks the 10th meeting where he has been out - qualified by @entity165 this season			2
he is 54 points behind his team - mate , a three - time winner this season , in the championship			1
@entity126 will start only 10th for the @entity23 @entity22 after he failed to make it into @entity150 @entity4 ’s pole rounded off a brilliant day for @entity173 motor racing in @entity62 after @entity174 was crowned @entity176 champion and @entity177 stormed to a lights - to - flag victory in this morning ’s gp3 race			1
@entity174 claimed his fourth win of the season to build an unassailable 66 point lead over @entity183 to become only the second @entity24 , after @entity4 's triumph in 2006 , to win @entity55 's feeder series			1
earlier , @entity177 after securing pole , led from the front before posting the fastest lap of the race			0
all of this on his debut for the @entity193 team .			0

@entity4 holds momentum over @entity0 in race for this season 's title
@entity32 's winless streak in danger of stretching to six races as @entity17 team - mate @entity4 bids to win his fourth consecutive race
he is 10 points adrift of @entity4 with only four grands prix remaining
@entity174 follows in @entity210 and @entity0 's footsteps by claiming *gp2* title
