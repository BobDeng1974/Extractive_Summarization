by @entity0 published : 06:25 est , 5 august 2013 updated : 06:55 est , 5 august 2013 a civil servant who drew a picture of what his family did on january 1 has kept it up every day since - and now has a charming pictorial diary of his young family 's day - to - day life			1
instead of merely writing down what happened each day , @entity9 , 42 , accompanies each posting with jokey cartoons , many of them featuring his six - year - old son , @entity15			1
the pen and ink drawings include mr @entity9 working out how to use his satnav , @entity15 losing a tooth during a visit to the cinema , family birthdays , and trips to the seaside			1
@entity27 family record : civil servant @entity9 , 42 , from @entity28 , @entity29 , began drawing his family 's day on january 1 this year , and has kept it up every day since happy family : @entity9 often uses his six - year - old son , @entity15 , as the subject for the day 's cartoons as he says such funny thing the majority of his creations , made using pen and acrylic paint , featured @entity15 , riding his bike , eating his dinner or playing in the garden or going to @entity43			1
other sketches show @entity15 on his @entity46 style broomstick , splashing in the paddling pool and eating ice cream			2
now his sketches are set to take the internet by storm after mr @entity9 , who lives with his wife , @entity53 , 43 , and son in @entity28 , @entity29 , began posting his thoughts online			1
until two years ago mr @entity9 , who works in the communications department at @entity57 , had never had any art training and did n’t even study art at school or college			1
but he said he had always drawn in his spare time and , after starting a new sketch book on january 1 when he drew a picture of what he had been doing that day , he decided to keep going , and keep an illustrated diary for the whole year			2
seven months in , he has not missed a day and said he may continue indefinitely as he has no wish to stop			0
each entry features an expertly drawn sketch of a day in the life of himself , primary school teacher wife @entity53 , and @entity15 , along with his notes on what they have been doing			1
mr @entity9 has had no real formal training , apart from a couple of drawing lessons he was given for his fortieth birthday two years ago , but is obviously talented the pictures are accurate , even down to what each of them was wearing that day - mr @entity9 says he often has to ask wife @entity53 , 43 , what they were wearing mr @entity9 said : ' drawing is something that i have always done but i never did anything with it			1
i never even studied art. ' a couple of years ago for my 40th birthday i was given some drawing lessons as a present , and it taught me basics that i did n’t even know about : palettes and colours			2
' they said to me in those classes that i had a skill for drawing and it really encouraged me			0
' having done a few commissions and sketches for friends , mr @entity9 has now set up his own company , completing cartoons , comic strips , caricatures and portraits for weddings and birthday parties			2
the pictures often feature young @entity15 because he does and says funny things that make good cartoons his father can draw ( once he 's back from work , right ) mundane parts of family life such as the car making a strange noise and childish tantrums are chronicled in mr @entity9 's cartoon diary he said : ' on january 1 we went for a walk and i decided to draw a cartoon of what we ’d been up to when we got back			1
' it was after that that i thought about doing one the next day and keeping it as a diary			0
' the cartoons focussed on my son because often he would have said or done something funny that i could draw			2
' since i started it ’s developed a real style of its own and i 'm really pleased with the way it has come out - of all of the drawings i 've done , there have only been a couple that i am not happy with			0
' i keep them true to life so even thought they are drawn from memory , i make sure that everyone has the clothes on that they were wearing during the day			0
' i often have an idea before i start but sometimes i do have to shout to @entity53 to remind me what i ’ve been doing			2
mr @entity9 says he does the cartoons every night , although he once got behind by four days because the family was on holiday the devoted father - of - one often uses @entity15 as his subject , whether it 's an exciting birthday party or the youngster having a tantrum over his football kit ' @entity15 has been good to focus on because he says the funniest things			1
and it helps to focus on him because otherwise some days it would just be about me driving to and from work			0
' now i want to keep going and i ’m determined to do the full year			0
it is such a nice record for us as a family and there are so many thing that i ’ve drawn that i would have just forgotten about			0
' mr @entity9 uses moleskin sketch books for the work and has so far filled four as he completes his diary			2
each is dated in the top left - hand corner and is drawn first in pencil , then pen , followed by a layer of thick brush pen before the top layer of acrylic paint is added			0
nerf guns and @entity46 films : mr @entity9 's family diary shows the minutiae of family life in great detail , and will be a record of its time as well as their own memories happy family : @entity53 and @entity9 and their son @entity15 now have a treasured pictorial record of their year so far he said his works feature simple colours and always take just half an hour to complete ' including two cups of tea '			1
the father - of - one carries out his artwork in a spare room every night , although he said he once got four days behind after a holiday			1
he said he is now deciding what to do with his work , which he uploads to @entity204 , @entity205 and @entity206 where he is building a growing fanbase			0
he said : ' the work is quite personal but i am now wondering whether i should publish them			0
there has been a great reaction online and i enjoy the response			0
' i ’ve never kept a diary before but i am really starting to see why people do			0
i ’ve really enjoyed it so far and it will be something to keep and look back on in the future			0
' washing the car and enjoying some rare sunshine : the cartoon diary entries show day - to - day family life for the @entity223 at their home in @entity29 @entity15 is unaware he is a literary star with a growing fanbase on his father 's @entity204 , @entity205 and @entity206 accounts touching family moments : the character of @entity9 and mrs @entity231 's son comes out in the cartoons , whether he 's happily eating pasta or kicking a football about @entity9 , seen left with his son @entity15 , has had no formal art training and works in a police communications team but is obviously a talented and skilled artist			1
