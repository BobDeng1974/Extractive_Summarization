district judge @entity37 agreed to put @entity21 's trial off until january to give the defence time to gather psychiatric report			1
she said : ' he ( @entity21 ) is admitting that he did the act but it is a question of whether he was aware of what is in the charge or whether he intended it in the other charge			1

' the judge also warned : ' i am not having this trial vacated , if he is not ready then that is unfortunate			2

defending , @entity70 said : ' the trial issue is essentially at the time of the offence mr @entity21 ’s mental state			1
' ' it seems now that this is plainly to be a case where the actual physical behaviour of mr @entity21 is n’t going to be in dispute , the defence are not going to be asking for any prosecution witnesses to be called			1
' as it happened : the green bottle can be seen bouncing next to @entity85 's @entity84 ( third left ) in this picture of the 100m @entity13 sprint from august 5 intervention : @entity91 @entity90 champion @entity89 , who intervened during the stadium incident , will no longer have to travel from @entity93 to give evidence against @entity21 this means that @entity91 @entity90 champion @entity89 , who intervened during the stadium incident , will no longer have to travel from @entity93 to give evidence against him			2

' explaining the message , she later described how she saw a man who was having ' behaviour problems ' and ' pushed him away hard '			2
' i did like any other person would have done , i corrected it			0
i just said , " man , you ’re crazy , what are you doing ? " , ' she said			0
' we are here for @entity13 heroes , people who are performing on the highest level , and we have to honour them , not disrespect them			0

@entity129 sprinter @entity128 , who took bronze , said : ' it was a little distraction and i did n’t know what it was			0
but when you ’re in those blocks and the whole stadium ’s quiet , you can hear a pin drop			0

' and @entity85 sprinter @entity84 said : ' i was so focused i did n’t see anything			0
i was so focused on just running to the line			0
' @entity21 was bailed to live at his home address or the hospital , and a condition not to enter any @entity13 venues was removed			2
