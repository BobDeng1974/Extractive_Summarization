it is a well - known fact that the technology industry is mostly dominated by men , but now , thanks to a new blog by a young female computing student , women in tech have finally been given a platform through which their amazing achievements are being recognized			1
@entity11 computer science student @entity10 , 21 , created women of @entity13 , a blog based on the people - profiling website humans of @entity17 , in order to showcase the talents and stories of tech 's best and brightest women working within the industry			1
' over the past couple years , i 've come into contact with some awesome women in tech through @entity11 or work , and i kept thinking to myself , why have i never heard of them before ? ' @entity10 told @entity30			1
girls on top : @entity11 computer science student @entity10 features talented women in the tech industry , such as @entity36 exec @entity35 , on her blog women of @entity13 @entity38 : many of the subjects featured on the blog talk on subjects that many women in the industry will have had to deal with looking up : the blog has attracted attention from the best in the business , including women - in - tech advocate @entity49 , a software engineer at @entity50 the blog , like the one that inspired it , features photos and stories of subjects in the industry , often accompanying them with inspirational quotes			1
in the description for the blog , @entity10 says that the goal of the project is ' to celebrate these living - and thriving - examples of female success , these rebels against the numbers and the gender norms			0
' in her ' letter from the editor ' , @entity10 also describes how an internship she completed at @entity71 was viewed as a ' give away ' by one of her classmates – who suggested that anyone would be able to secure one of the highly sought - after positions if a woman had been offered one , despite applauding a male friend for being given the very same job			0
she recounts other moments of horrific sexism she has experienced while working in various offices - from shameless come - ons from married colleagues to blanket , patronizing statements of ' women do n't code ' told directly to her by colleagues			0
the brains behind it all : @entity10 , 21 , created the blog after experiencing the bias against women in the industry first - hand underrepresented : the women in @entity13 blog aims ' to celebrate these living - and thriving - examples of female success , these rebels against the numbers and the gender norms ' quotables : the women featured on the blog open up about their own experiences of subtle - and less subtle - sexism in the office it was after such experiences that , @entity109 says , she realized the importance of having idols in the industry			1
speaking in more detail to @entity30 , she added : ' as a woman who 's worked in almost entirely male environments , i know being able to look up to someone is crucial for getting through rough patches , for feeling a sense of belonging to your work			0
' the idea has already attracted some big names , including some of the most vocal advocates for women in tech like @entity49 , who joined social media giant @entity50 , where she still works as a software engineer , back when it was still a start - up			1
@entity49 herself has also made strides in bringing awareness to the gender disparity in tech. inspired : the blog 's goal is to is to inspire women to continue on in computer sciences , because it is more possible to succeed than some may think all together : the blog encourages women to be proud of their own achievements and encourage others in similar circumstances in a blog post last year on medium the engineer wrote : ' the actual numbers i ’ve seen and experienced in industry are far lower than anybody is willing to admit			1
this means nobody is having honest conversations about the issue			0
' with that in mind , @entity49 created a @entity158 spreadsheet in which tech companies could reveal their demographics to world , and over 200 companies have self - reported on their diversity since			2
but the numbers do n't look good when it comes to some of the world ’s most well - known tech companies			2
@entity170 records that only 26 of its 275 software engineering employees are female , while @entity173 records 19 of 149 and @entity158 shows only 10 out of 160			0
in her quest to raise awareness , and with names like @entity49 's in her corner , @entity10 is hoping to one day feature the likes of @entity71 's @entity180 , @entity181 , and @entity182 , the ceo and co-founder of non-profit tech - focused organisation @entity184			2
' i want women who are sitting on the fence about @entity188 to get as inspired as i was by these role models , ' @entity10 told @entity30			0
' and hopefully , to see that at its heart tech is exciting , immensely powerful and so , so worth it			0
