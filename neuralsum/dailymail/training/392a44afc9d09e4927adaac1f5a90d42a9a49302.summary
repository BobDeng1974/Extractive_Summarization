by @entity0 published : 22:56 est , 6 february 2013 updated : 03:43 est , 7 february 2013 a schoolboy has been excluded for allegedly performing a @entity3 salute in class to his teacher			0
a teacher accused @entity7 , 14 , of making the racist hand gesture while clicking his heels and saying ' @entity10 ' at @entity11 , in @entity12 , @entity13			1
the boy denies using the phrase and clicking his heels , and says he was unaware he was being ' racist ' when he stretched out his left arm to imitate his teacher , who was using her hand to signal for the class to be quiet			1
@entity7 , 14 , with father @entity19 , maintains he was not being racist and was only mimicking his teacher following the incident in november last year , @entity7 was punished with a two - hour detention after school			1
however @entity7 and his parents refused to accept the punishment and demanded a meeting with the school to have the incident thoroughly investigated			1
not backing down : mr @entity7 wanted the matter ' properly investigated ' his father @entity29 said : ' we asked the school to talk to the teacher as we thought she may have misjudged the incident as racist			1
' at most it could have been seen as undermining her authority but definitely not racist			0
' if investigated properly with witness statements from the other 20 or so children there , it would show the teacher was mistaken			0
' although the detention was postponed , headteacher @entity42 contacted the @entity44 in january to say @entity7 must serve the punishment but the school was prepared to no longer describe the incident as racist			1
@entity19 , 41 , said : ' we refused as we said all along we would n't accept a change of accusation , especially after accusing our son of racism without further investigation and causing so much upset to all our family			0
' on friday , @entity7 came home from school and told his parents he had been in exclusion for the day			1
his father says @entity7 had his phone taken away from him and ' all communication with the other children was severed			1
' mr @entity7 , who lives with @entity64 in @entity65 , @entity13 added : ' it 's been upsetting because @entity7 has been questioned again and again because we 've not been getting answers from the school			2
' but we stick by our son			0
' mr @entity7 says he is now going to lodge a complaint with the board of governors			2
the school says @entity7 must serve the punishment but it was prepared to no longer describe the incident as racist headteacher @entity42 said : ' the standard procedure when students have an after school detention is if they miss it twice they will have a day of internal exclusion in our internal exclusion unit			2
' we had discussions with @entity7 and mrs @entity90 and we did agree we would n't categorise it as a racist incident but that it would be a serious incident and the punishment would stand			2
' a racist incident is defined by perception of other people rather than the intention of the person who committed it and this is the point we tried to make			0
' the fact remains a teacher took great exception and perceived the incident as racist			0
' however , as i said this was a point we were willing to re-categorise and that is where we left it			0

student @entity7 denies he said ' @entity10 '
claims he was mimicking teacher who had raised arm to signal for quiet
