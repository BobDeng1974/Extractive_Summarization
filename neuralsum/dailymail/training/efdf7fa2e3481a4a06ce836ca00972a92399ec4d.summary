at the end of his country ’s disastrous @entity3 campaign in @entity5 , @entity0 hinted at familiar problems that seem to have been around @entity8 football almost as long as their famous orange shirts			1
‘ if you want to accomplish something together , you have to put egos aside , ’ said the @entity12 winger			1
‘ you have to fight as a team to regain that sense of invincibility			0
it wo n’t come by itself			0
’ @entity12 lost all three group games two years ago			1
after having been @entity25 finalists two years previously , @entity23 ’s team fell apart quickly and the common conception was that familiar failings had done for them again			1
leaders : @entity0 and @entity30 have taken on the roles of responsibility in the @entity8 setup under @entity34 @entity35 , who scored brilliantly against @entity37 , has flourished in @entity38 so far here in @entity38 , they will tell you it is different			1
they will tell you that @entity45 ’s squad finally understand the value of unity and that @entity0 has played an integral part — along with @entity49			1
@entity50 , who will return to the side after suspension for tomorrow ’s last 16 tie against @entity54 , is @entity55 ’s captain while @entity0 is the understudy			1
a decision made by @entity55 on taking the job , it says something that the two men he stood down , @entity62 and @entity63 , remain integral and uncomplaining members of the squad			0
anyone who saw @entity63 running himself into the ground at left back against @entity68 earlier this week will have noticed evidence of ongoing commitment			0
relationship : manager and captain are extremely close in the @entity12 camp , with each quick to praise the other @entity77 has also brought the best out of @entity0 as the two stars lead their team at the more glamorous point of the team , @entity50 and @entity0 are writing their names all over this @entity25			1
neither player has always been easy to handle			0
@entity86 struggled to hit the right note with the @entity89 striker while @entity0 was viewed as a shirker during his years with @entity91			1
‘ @entity94 ’ , was @entity93 ’s sobriquet for him			0
if @entity12 are to progress deeper into this tournament , though , it is clear that both players will be very influential			1
those who follow the team closely say the responsibility of leadership has brought the best out of them			0
@entity50 ’s bond with @entity55 is clear , illustrated perfectly by the rather clumsy but genuine high five the two men exchanged after the @entity89 striker ’s diving header against @entity37 two weeks ago			0
‘ if we do well here it will be because of the coach , ’ said @entity50			0
@entity0 , meanwhile , is said to have matured somewhat since his days in @entity109			2
he has married his long - term girlfriend , is an ambassador for his first club , @entity112 , and is involved in a project to encourage young @entity8 children to read more			2
meaningful : it may have been slightly clumsy but this high five showed the unity in the @entity8 camp wonder - strike : @entity0 has been excellent in the group stages , including scoring this solo goal but then maybe the reason for @entity55 ’s successful nurturing of his two best players is more simple			1
@entity50 and @entity0 both have egos to match their abundant gifts			2
they have long seen themselves as the two most important figures in the @entity8 squad so what better way to channel that positively than by handing them the responsibilities of leadership ? willing : @entity63 has shown himself more than happy to be part of the team despite losing the vice-captaincy this is a @entity8 squad that is gifted but also flawed			2
@entity12 look vulnerable through the middle of their defence			2
@entity145 gave them a scare in their second group game and against @entity37 in game one they could have been two or three down before turning the game spectacularly on its head			0
in the centre of midfield , @entity154 can appear one - paced and has looked like a walking red card at times			0
so @entity12 need to function fully up front if they are to prosper			2
@entity55 seems to have got the balance right so far .			0

since @entity3 @entity12 **'s** two *big* stars have been given responsibility
@entity49 is @entity45 **'s** captain , @entity0 vice captain
both players have grown into their roles
sense of togetherness *inspiring* @entity8 at @entity25
