@entity0 good job @entity1 was n’t around when the two teams were lining up in the tunnel before the game			0
gone are the days when the two teams are eyeballing each other in the moments before kick off because now it is all cuddles			0
former @entity11 defender @entity10 and @entity12 were having a proper love in before they walked out			0
where ’s @entity16 when you need him ? @entity1 , talking to @entity19 assistant manager @entity18 , would not have appreciated the hugs before kick - off tough week it has been a week of setbacks for @entity19 chairman @entity24			1
his @entity25 went into administration and he has also had some bad news on his plans to press ahead with a stadium development at @entity30			0
@entity31 , the current owners of the land where @entity24 hopes to build a super stadium , have announced they are pressing ahead with their own regeneration plans in the area ... and it does n’t involve @entity19			1
@entity38 on the bench @entity40 made a big decision to leave @entity42 out of the @entity19 team to face @entity44 , but sitting on the bench at @entity46 is no way to end one of the great players ’ careers			2
@entity42 is no longer at the peak of his powers and it will be agony to watch him go out like this			0
after a tough start to life at @entity19 , @entity42 has been dropped to the bench by manager @entity40 @entity58 ? a week tafter @entity59 posed with his shirt off to prove he was n’t three stone overweight , @entity19 owner @entity24 got in on the act too by putting his own topless selfie on social media			1
the airline boss has not quite such an impressive six pack , though - more of a @entity68 ’s @entity67			0
@entity19 owner @entity24 posed with his shirt off on @entity70 to prove he 's not three stone overweight @entity72 when @entity74 returned from a muscle injury at the start of last season it took him three months to get up to @entity78 pace - his next goal after getting hurt at @entity80 in september did n’t come until january			1
he looked rusty on monday night - bad news for boss @entity82 who needs his main striker to come good quickly			2
@entity85 international @entity74 was off the pace for @entity11 on monday at @entity19			1

@entity19 chairman @entity24 ' new stadium plans take a hit
defender @entity42 once again watched from the home bench
@entity11 's main striker @entity74 looks well off the pace
