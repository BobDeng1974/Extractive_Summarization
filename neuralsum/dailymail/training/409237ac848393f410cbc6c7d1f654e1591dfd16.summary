it was at the @entity1 last april that @entity3 fans unfurled a banner reading ‘ @entity5 : killing @entity6 ’			1
eight months later , they are a happier bunch			0
‘ we ’re gon na win the league , ’ the travelling supporters sang			0
a case of two extremes certainly , but this was another victory to cement the standing of both @entity15 and @entity3			1
they remain fifth and looking up			0
@entity17 ( left ) proved @entity3 's unlikely matchwinner as they defeated @entity19 2 - 1 away on tuesday night @entity17 ( far left ) gave @entity3 a 2 - 1 lead just before half - time with a bullet header from a @entity24 cross @entity19 goalkeeper @entity25 ( far right ) watches on as @entity27 ' ( centre ) header goes past him and into the net the centre - back ( centre ) is congratulated by his team - mates as his header gives the @entity35 side the lead on the stroke of half - time @entity19 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity39 7 ; wisdom 6 , @entity41 6.5 , @entity42 6 , @entity43 5.5 ( @entity44 83 ' ) ; @entity45 6 ( @entity46 65 ' 5 ) , @entity47 5.5 ( @entity48 45 ' 5.5 ) ; @entity49 6.5 , @entity50 6 , @entity51 6 ; @entity52 6.5 subs not used : @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 booked : @entity47 manager : @entity59 6 @entity3 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity60 6 ; @entity61 6 , @entity62 6.5 , @entity17 6.5 , @entity63 6.5 ; @entity64 7 , @entity65 6 ; @entity66 6.5 ( @entity67 65 ' ) , @entity68 6.5 ( @entity69 78 ' 5 ) , @entity24 7.5 ; @entity70 6.5 ( @entity71 65 ' 5 ) subs not used : @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76			1
manager : @entity15 7 referee : @entity79 5 @entity80 : @entity24 attendance : 23,975 @entity19 can only look over their shoulders			2
@entity59 has overseen a fourth successive loss , as the relegation places loom closer			0
fan chants told his story too			0
‘ @entity88 , ’ the home crowd shouted			0
they have seen their team win only three times in the @entity92 this calendar year			0
@entity59 said : ‘ it ’s not going to help but i ca n’t control that , the fans have every right to behave in every way they chose			0
' i ’ve said we are a lot stronger if everybody is pulling in the same direction			0
' it comes with the territory			0
it ’s not that long since @entity15 went through it			0
’ @entity106 evidently lacks full confidence in his squad players to alter starting line - ups much			2
summer signing @entity46 was brought on in the second half for only his second appearance of the season			2
striker @entity115 , who cost £ 9million , came on with six minutes to go for his first outing since late october			2
it is quite the opposite for @entity15 , who won here without starting @entity119 or the injured @entity120 – two players who lit up @entity3 ’s opening games			2
@entity64 scored his first goal since february on his return to the side , while @entity17 found the winner with a header on the stroke of half - time			1
@entity41 had given @entity19 an early lead but the high spirits soon faded			1
‘ our summer months of hard work in recruiting terms and pre season are still paying off for us , ’ said @entity15			0
‘ it was n’t great but it was resilient			0
coming back from 1 - 0 down away from home is always a big task			2
’ @entity19 striker @entity51 ( right ) takes on @entity61 down @entity3 's right - flank during the opening stages of the match @entity64 ( left ) and @entity42 contest for a 50/50 challenge at the @entity1 on tuesday night @entity19 defender @entity41 ( centre ) headed his side into an early lead on 10 minutes after a cross from team - mate @entity49 @entity41 jumps up in the air with delight after his header gives @entity19 the lead against @entity3 the centre back ( second left ) is congratulated by his @entity19 team - mates after scoring the game 's opener click here to view our brilliant @entity158 including the move for @entity64 's equaliser against @entity19 @entity19 took the lead in the 10th minute when @entity52 turned @entity17 and earned a free - kick on the angle of the area			1
@entity49 whipped across a devious ball , but it was far too simple for @entity41 to bound into the six - yard area , past @entity17 , and find a glancing header into the net			1
given @entity19 ’s last goal came virtue of the rather unfortunate @entity173 in victory at @entity175 , this broke a run of 370 minutes since someone on the payroll had scored			1
it was reward for a bright start , but near enough straight away the hosts began to sit back			0
@entity3 needed no invitation to attack			2
by half - time the visitors were ahead			1
@entity64 , at 32 , is less of a fixture in @entity15 ’s side than he once was but he still possesses an uncanny ability at close range			1
in the 35th minute @entity24 flung a free - kick into the area			0
@entity47 only cleared @entity17 ’ header into the air and @entity70 connected in spectacular fashion with a bicycle kick that flew at goal			1
@entity39 sprang to save but @entity64 had ghosted into the six - yard box and nodded the rebound in – his first goal since february 22			1
on the stroke of half - time @entity47 was forced off injured and @entity3 went ahead			1
@entity39 pushed a shot from @entity65 round the post to concede a corner			0
@entity24 flighted it deep and @entity17 out - leapt @entity41 to head home			1
a role reversal of earlier – and far too easy again			0
@entity41 had a chance to atone seven minutes after the interval , but dragged his shot horribly wide			1
then , just as they did against @entity210 , @entity19 roused to rally in the final 10 minutes			1
@entity52 found space in the box and drove a shot at goal that @entity60 saved with his legs , then @entity49 hit a volley that flashed just wide			2
once again , it was too little , too late			0
video our hard work is paying off - @entity15 @entity3 captain @entity64 ( left ) is mobbed by @entity65 ( centre ) and @entity70 after scoring their equaliser against the @entity19 @entity64 ( centre right ) headed home from point - blank range on 35 minutes to score his first goal since february 22 @entity64 ( far right ) is congratulated by his @entity3 team - mates as his first half header levels the scores at the @entity1 @entity19 striker @entity52 ( centre right ) takes a tumble following a hefty challenge from @entity27 ( centre left ) @entity52 ( centre ) proved a real handful for the @entity3 defence throughout the match with his physical presence @entity3 substitute @entity119 ( left ) came on and was involved in with an awkward looking collision with @entity41 @entity19 boss @entity59 ( left ) looks dejected at the full - time whistle as the @entity3 players celebrate their win			1
