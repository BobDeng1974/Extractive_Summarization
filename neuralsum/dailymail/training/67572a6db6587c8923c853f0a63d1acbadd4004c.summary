by @entity0 kittens have been paralysed , had their skulls broken and had ­ electrodes stuck onto their brains , ribs and spine as part of a series of shocking experiments at 10 of the country 's most prestigious universities			1
the cruel procedures on the helpless subjects have been performed so scientists can improve their understanding of the human body			1
some of the animals were raised in complete darkness while others had one of their eyes stitched closed so scientists could analyse problems surrounding ' lazy eye '			1
others had their lungs deliberately collapsed during the brutal procedures and many were injected with paralysing drugs to stop them moving or breathing			1
this picture was taken during a similar procedure at the @entity35 brutal : scientists put the kittens under anaesthetic but when the procedures were finished , most of the cats were given fatal overdoses			1
animal charity @entity43 captured these images at @entity45 last year scientists put the kittens under anaesthetic but when the experiments were finished , most of them were killed			0
in a document seen by @entity53 , 10 universities including @entity51 were listed as having performed the controversial tests			1
@entity55 gave adult cats anaesthetic before screwing plates into their skull while they were placed face down			1
electrodes were then attached to their spine to ' investigate how abdominal nerve cells and muscles work together to allow for normal respiration , coughing and breathing			0
' to test ' feedback mechanisms ' between the eyes and the brain , they placed electrodes onto certain areas of the brain after removing parts of their skull			0
the @entity74 purposely bred cats for their experiments , which involved ' cutting through the skin and bone to gain access to the skull			1
' some of the food regimes , which lasted for six weeks , were high in fat and harmful			0
@entity83 and @entity84 raised kittens and their mothers in ' complete darkness ' to test how certain brain functions related to amblyopia , commonly known as ‘ lazy eye ’			1
some kittens were raised normally and then placed in complete darkness for a week			1
other kittens had one eye closed through the use of sutures in the eyelids for up to seven days			1
major head surgery was done to prepare the kittens for testing			2
they were then anaesthetised and paralysed with a drug which prevented them from breathing or moving			0
a hole was made through their throats into their tracheas ( wind pipe ) so that a tube could be inserted and used to artificially ' breathe ' for them			0
the @entity111 is also said to be ' directly involved ' in the experiments			2
experiments : procedures where skulls were cracked opened and electrodes inserted were carried out to test the ' feedback mechanisms ' between the eyes and the brain			2
this animal was part of an experiment at the @entity35 animal campaigners have reacted angrily to the revelations with one calling the procedures ' repulsive '			1
@entity126 , the director of @entity127 said : ' the extreme suffering and stress endured by the cats and kittens used in these repulsive experiments is deeply disturbing to imagine			2
' quite apart from the suffering caused , these appalling procedures are highly unlikely to contribute to medical progress , since the results of animal experiments can not be reliably translated to humans			2
' instead of torturing cats and kittens in perversely cruel experiments , @entity55 should move into the twenty - first century and embrace the wide range of non-animal methods that are available to scientists and produce valid , human - relevant results			2
' the shocking treatment of the kittens was outlined in a report by the @entity148 ( @entity148 )			2
ceo of the @entity148 , @entity149 , said : ' over 5 million families in the @entity151 share their home with one or more cats yet these much loved animals are still being used in cruel experiments in which they can be subjected to invasive brain surgery or deliberately deprived of light or vision by being raised in total darkness or by having their eyelids sewn shut			1
' much of the research is fundamental and the @entity148 believes that sophisticated alternative techniques , which do not involve animal suffering , should be used instead			0
we are calling on the government to end the cruel use of cats in @entity151 laboratories			2
' comedian and author , @entity171 , who is campaigning with the @entity148 , will deliver report titled ‘ what is happening to cats ? ’ to the @entity177			1
mr @entity171 said : ' as a cat owner myself i know what wonderful companions they can be and how affectionate , intelligent and playful			0
' that is why i am joining with the @entity148 to ask the @entity151 government to bring an end to the use of all cats in experimentation			2
it is time to stop this cruel and unnecessary suffering			0
' last year , animal charity @entity43 challenged the @entity35 over their treatment of cats during animal testing			1
the organisation managed to capture some of the animals during the procedures			0
a spokesman from the @entity51 said : ' the research to which @entity148 refers involved scientists from a number of @entity151 institutions , including researchers from @entity51 , who analysed tissue samples			0
' this research was part of the development of a potential new treatment for amblyopia ( lazy eye ) , a common disorder of vision which affects one in 50 children			1
' as it would be unethical to carry out such research using humans , initial studies were carried out using mice and rats ; in order to further understand whether the treatment was effective , it was then necessary to carry out further work in a higher order animal – in this case a small number of cats			0
' controversial : ten of the country 's most prestigious universities were said to be involved in the procedures similar to that performed at the @entity35 ( pictured )			1
many of the cats were held down like this during the brutal experiments a spokesman for @entity55 said the experiments mentioned in the article were carried out in 1992 and 1998			0
reacting to the allegations , @entity83 spokesperson said : ' the research referenced in today ’s story ended in 2010			0
' our research involving animals is aimed at the alleviation of human and veterinary disease through the advancement of medical , dental , biological and veterinary understanding			0
' all animal - related research work at @entity83 is designed and carried out in accordance with the principles of the @entity255 under veterinary oversight and in compliance with the strict conditions imposed by the @entity259			0
' a representative from @entity74 said it could state categorically that the type of research highlighted has not been carried out at the @entity35 for at least seven years @entity53 has contacted the other institutions for comment			0
helpless : one cat , with a screw in its skull , pokes its head out of a blanket during an experiment at the @entity35			0

findings have been published in report which will be sent to the @entity177
