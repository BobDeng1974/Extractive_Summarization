once a universally acknowledged style disaster - and only sported by pensioners on the beach - the sandals and socks look has made a resurgence lately , thanks to celebrities such as @entity8 and @entity9			1
however , it appears the nation is still unconvinced : wearing socks with your sandals has just been voted the biggest fashion faux pas of all time in a poll carried out by @entity17			0
zero socks appeal : style icons @entity8 and @entity9 may love the look , but the rest of us loathe it ... socks and @entity24 for men low slung @entity26 @entity27 , spokesperson for the store , said : ' socks and sandals are the epitome of @entity33 summer style gone wrong			1
' the fashion crowd might have classed it as en vogue but our customers have voted it the worst look of all time			0
' other fashion catastrophes on the list include platforms on men ( sorry , @entity46 ) and low - slung trousers , as well as 80s horrors such as shell suits and bum bags			1
crop tops also appeared in the top ten - even though they 've been all over the red carpet for a while now			2
@entity27 explained : ' it might look chic on a catwalk , but this is nâ€™t a look that many of us want to see on our local @entity61			0
' crop flop : belly - baring tops , like those worn by @entity64 and @entity65 , were voted one of the most hated styles in fact , quite a few of the top ten most hated styles have been adopted of late by the fashion crowd			2
model of the moment @entity64 is a serial offender			0
low - slung trousers ? tick			1
she 's worn them all			0
she even appeared in a campaign for accessories brand my @entity84 in december last year - the hair ties came in at number ten on the list			0
so what are we to conclude ? well , that only ridiculously beautiful under - 25s - and @entity8 - should attempt to get away with wearing clothes quite so hideous ... crime against fashion : sadly for boho babes @entity96 and @entity98 , gypsy - style skirts are also considered beyond the pale			1
