@entity0 saw off @entity1 in a dramatic @entity3 quarter - final to book their place in the final four			1
it took @entity6 just 12 minutes for @entity8 's men to get going with a precise header that proved enough for @entity0 to win 1 - 0			1
but how did the players get on individually ? @entity11 gives his ratings			2
@entity0 @entity13 : 7 thirty - two years after @entity14 grabbed the headlines against @entity1 , @entity13 had a quieter afternoon			1
@entity16 : 7.5 removed as defensive midfield pivot to steady a shaky defence , the captain thrived in more familiar ground			1
@entity21 : 6 preferred to @entity22 as @entity6 ' partner but still looked vulnerable to balls over the top			2
a superb header opened the scoring			1
@entity38 : 6.5 not in his natural role but continues to show little evidence of being uncomfortable as a full back			2
@entity42 : 7.5 another to benefit from the @entity16 switch , he revelled in being the quarterback again			1
couple of key interceptions too			0
leap : @entity0 defender @entity21 ( right ) tries to win the ball during the quarter - final clash peace : @entity42 ( right ) made key interceptions and looked comfortable as quarterback @entity51 : 6 not as busy as his defensive midfield partner but got through what work he had diligently			1
deserved yellow card from cynical play			0
@entity56 : 6.5 removed from false nine duties to act as a deeper and wider foil in the attack but still an absolute pest			0
@entity61 : 6.5 the man with the most completed passes in the tournament was at it again			0
superb delivery for the opener			0
rally : @entity56 encourages his @entity0 team - mates during their crucial win over @entity1 opener : @entity0 celebrate after their first goal to get them on their way to the @entity3 semi-finals @entity78 : 6 needed an upturn against @entity34 and provided it			1
carried that improved form here			0
busy if a little isolated from play			0
@entity82 : 6 @entity8 went horses for courses and finally called on his @entity3 thoroughbred			1
led the line energetically but threw in an awful dive too			0
manager @entity8 : 8 made some huge calls in team selection and saw one immediately justified with @entity6 ' goal			1
yellow cards : @entity51 ( 54 ) , @entity42 ( 80 ) boss : @entity0 manager @entity8 ( right ) chats with assistant coach @entity94 during the win celebrate : @entity0 made the semi-finals after seeing off @entity1 in a tight encounter @entity99 pedigree : per @entity22 hugs @entity100 in the tunnel after the crunch match @entity103 @entity104 : 6 nothing the captain could do about @entity6 ' header			1
attempts at quick distribution came to little			0
@entity110 : 6 marshalled @entity78 relatively well			0
tried to get forward plenty but got little change out of @entity38			0
@entity112 : 5 preferred to @entity113 but so easily out - muscled by @entity6 for the opener			1
not a great day out			0
in : @entity104 dives to make a save but could n't stop @entity6 from giving @entity0 the lead backtracking : @entity104 could do nothing about @entity6 ' header and could not captain his side to victory @entity121 : 5.5 still struggles to convince that he 's the Â£ 15million defender @entity122 thought they were getting			1
@entity124 : 6 toiled at times against @entity126 but more solid here			2
superb cross to @entity129 before break deserved better			0
@entity131 : 6 withdrawn after 73 minutes of trying - but failing - to control operations in midfield			2
lacked support but he 's had better days			0
beaten : @entity124 loses out on a header during @entity1 's loss to @entity0 in the quarter - final task : @entity131 was withdrawn after 73 minutes after trying - but failing - to control the game @entity141 : 5.5 blessed not to have been suspended for this one but he struggled to impose himself at times in the middle			1
@entity143 : 6.5 took it to the @entity145 with five first - half dribbles but we 've already come to expect so much more			2
for him , a quiet day			0
@entity149 : 6 he might not make it much higher than the corner flag but he has really raised his game in @entity153			2
control : @entity1 crashed out of the @entity3 in the quarter - finals but @entity0 make the final four heading home : @entity129 could n't find the back of the net , despite his last - gasp effort @entity129 : 6 @entity162 back - to - back blanks after a red - hot start to the tournament but had chances to get back on the board here			1
@entity168 : 5.5 could have laid one on a plate for @entity129 early on had he steadied himself			0
manager @entity171 : 6 like his opposite number , made a change in central defence but it was n't nearly as successful			2
yellow cards : none gutted : @entity1 crashed out of the @entity3 at the hands of @entity0 and will be heading home frustrated : @entity1 manager @entity171 could do little to lift his team to the @entity3 semi-finals referee @entity183 ( @entity184 ) : 7 got two first - half penalty calls spot on			1
otherwise was unfussy and happy to let things flow .			0

@entity0 beat @entity1 1 - 0 to move into the @entity3 semi-finals
@entity6 opened scoring with header for @entity0 12 minutes in
@entity42 and @entity16 solid in quarter - final win
