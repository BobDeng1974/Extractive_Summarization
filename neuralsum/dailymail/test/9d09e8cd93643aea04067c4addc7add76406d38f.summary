rating : @entity0 is a swish new hotel in @entity2 , a three - minute walk from the cathedral , offering terrific value			1
it 's quite a venture - and must have been a huge investment			1
there are 21 rooms , all with copper standalone baths placed near luxurious double beds			1
i keep thinking about @entity13 , the former @entity14 footballer whose home once appeared in @entity16 ! and which forever more is held as the gold standard for unadulterated bling			1
which is to say that @entity0 is glossy and lavish , but manages to stay on the right side of kitsch , not least because the finish is so good			1
there is n't a scuff in sight			2
@entity27 : @entity0 is as much a @entity29 retreat as a hideaway in genteel @entity2 no , it might not be to all tastes ( there are mirrors everywhere with poetry written on them , such as lines from @entity38 : ' since my house to thy house no greater can send than thy house but my house , friend comforting friend ' ) and the floors are given over to black - and - white squares with embedded stars			1
but you would be hard pressed not to have a good time here			2
we arrive on a wet blustery evening			0
i pop into reception and ask where we can park and am told to leave the car exactly where it is			0
valet parking will sort it at no extra charge			1
then a man who says he has a @entity61 father and @entity63 mother escorts us purposefully to our room , opens the door and says : ' you have every shade of grey in here			0
' he must have used the line dozens of times , but still gets a kick from it			0
we unpack our whips ( sorry , wash bags ) before hurrying down to the shiny , funky bar and order two glasses of bubbly			0
black and white : @entity0 incorporates smart , clean lines , elegant décor and crisp white tablecloths we 're in the zone , sitting on stools at the flashy bar as if auditioning as extras for a @entity29 sequel , and have to pinch ourselves that this is @entity90			1
the main dining room is a more formal , carpeted affair with crisp , white tablecloths and huge , bulbous wine glasses			0
there 's an amuse bouche ( naturally ) , followed by impressive , but over-elaborate , scallops and then perfectly cooked steaks			2
back in our room , there are gadgets galore : a tv that connects to the internet , a @entity105 sound system accessible via @entity106 , a tablet computer playing the role of the hotel directory			2
the carpet is thick , the shiny bedhead and curtains so over the top they make us chuckle			0
after breakfast , we tell a member of staff that we want to visit the cathedral			2
' just leave everything packed in your room and we will put it all your car , which will be waiting for you when you return			0
' it is , too			0
@entity0 used to be an old people 's home			1
for any lingering ghosts from those days , it must seem like a thousand years ago			0
@entity0 @entity2 @entity129 @entity130 01353 887777 @entity131 doubles from £ 159 b&b rating :			1
