tsunamis - the devastatingly huge waves caused by underwater earthquakes - are usually associated with coastlines of @entity4 or the @entity5			1
but new research proves that massive tidal waves sparked by seismic activity have also ravaged @entity10 shores in the past - and could be repeated			1
scientists from the @entity12 found geological evidence that tsunami waves have swept over @entity16 's coastline - rising to up to 20 metres above sea level in some places			1
the beaches of @entity16 are popular with tourists - but scientists have warned the area could witness a tsunami they identified 70 - ton boulders inland that had been picked up from the seabed before being carried along by the huge waves and dumped far inland			1
studies of neighbouring coastlines show there has been a major tsunami , on average , every 400 years , thought to be linked to earthquakes beneath @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity34			0
scientist professor @entity35 said : ' it appears that no event of the magnitude indicted by the new evidence has occurred within the past 300 years and so there is no historical memory of any such devastating event			2
' but , he added : ' it is highly likely that there have been other equally devastating waves previously and that there will be more in the future			0
' the north - east coast is now @entity16 's most densely populated region and if a similar sized wave struck today , it could threaten thousands of people , experts are warning			1
many residents and holidaymakers live by or visit the north - eastern coasts , where the towns are built right up to the edge of the shoreline			0
tsunamis are commonly associated with @entity4 ( pictured ) , but experts say they could hit coastlines in @entity10 lead scientist dr @entity63 said : ' the most important thing we can do is to educate people about the risk and give the @entity16 government the evidence needed to prepare and protect residents and holidaymakers			2
' however , if a repeat tsunami occurred now , the risks are high			0
in the light of these recent findings it now appears that @entity16 would benefit from a re-evaluation of the tsunami threat ' if people feel an earthquake , they need to know that there is a risk of a tsunami , and if they see the sea recede they should know to get to higher ground			0
' fortunately in @entity16 , higher ground is never far away , but people do need to be made aware of the risks			0
' it is thought earthquakes linked to the @entity32 volcanoes ( pictured ) have caused tidal waves in the past			2

evidence shows tsunamis have hit @entity16 and @entity97 in the past
scientists found huge wave picked up 70 - ton boulders from seabed
their research raises fears that huge tidal waves could return to region
with *island* now popular with tourists , experts warn impact would be huge
