by @entity0 and @entity1 it is one of the world 's most important and best preserved crusader castles , which once held off a siege by the @entity8 warrior @entity7 some 900 years ago and was lauded for its beauty by @entity11			1
but the @entity12 has now fallen victim to the chaos of @entity16 's civil war following a siege between @entity19 forces and villagers and rebels using the castle for refuge , much like the @entity24 before them			1
the @entity19 offensive in march saw heavy artillery damage the castle 's walls , while an airstrike punctured its roof and shrapnel tore through its religious artifacts			1
about two years ago , president @entity60 's forces identified the @entity62 - populated village of @entity63 as backing the rebels			1
they began an armed blockade that allowed no one to leave or go inside			0
the government said @entity69 harbored foreign , @entity70 - linked armed insurgents who terrorized neighboring , mostly @entity74 villages			2
' the terrorists killed and kidnapped people and even chopped off their heads , ' said a @entity16 army officer , speaking on the condition of anonymity , using the government term for the insurgents			1
' we had to stop them at any cost			0
' his claim could not be independently verified and @entity16 government officials accompanied @entity1 journalists on their trip in the region			1
under the heavy bombardment last winter , @entity63 's population of around 9,000 people had nowhere to go but up the hill to the castle			1
some fled to neighboring @entity97 in a daring dash through the army blockade			0
hundreds barricaded themselves inside the castle - men , women and children			2
among them were dozens of rebel fighters who occasionally lobbed mortar shells from inside the tall walls , hitting nearby @entity74 villages , government soldiers and locals say			1
refuge : under heavy bombardment last winter , @entity63 's population of around 9,000 people had nowhere to go but up the hill to the castle shelter : the villagers apparently hoped that castle 's thick walls and its historic importance would prevent the @entity16 army from further shelling the insurgents are overwhelmingly from the country 's @entity62 majority			1
@entity125 and @entity74 minorities have either remained neutral or supported @entity60 , fearing for their fate should hard - liners come to power			0
those who found shelter inside the citadel ate the little food they had taken with them , or sneaked out at night to search for anything that could be cooked , including cats and dogs			0
for seven months , they slept in the tiny church inside a walled compound , or in huge and dark stone halls used as horse stables by the @entity24 in the 12th century			0
mattresses and blankets , together with clothes , shoes and gas cookers lay scattered on damp stone and soil floors inside the castle when @entity1 journalists recently visited it			2
pages from a copy of the @entity154 fluttered in the breeze inside the church , which was turned into a mosque when @entity157 captured the fortress in the 13th century			0
the villagers apparently hoped that castle 's thick walls and its historic importance would prevent the @entity16 army from further shelling			1
in march , during a massive government offensive against opposition strongholds on the border with @entity97 , @entity16 jets unleashed a series of airstrikes			1
heavy cannon fire pummeled the castle walls , with shells causing some ancient stone structures to crumble			1
some of the shells ricocheted against the mighty stone structures , leaving deep marks on the historic citadel			0
difficulties : those who found shelter inside the citadel ate the little food they had taken with them , or sneaked out at night to search for anything that could be cooked , including cats and dogs the army did not stop there			0
its tanks went house to house in the empty village , methodically destroying each			0
the smell of burned rubble lingered in the air			0
a legless sofa stood in front of the @entity199 shoe store where looters left only empty shoe boxes			0
an old tv set , a gold colored chandelier , a wooden bed frame and a wrecked refrigerator littered the main @entity207 street			0
destroyed cars stood parked inside garages of the sagging homes , their metal shutters twisted and dotted by shrapnel			0
about 300 villagers and rebels were killed in the offensive , hundreds more were wounded while thousands managed to flee under fire across the border to @entity97 , according to government figures			1
hundreds surrendered or were captured			0
@entity222 , a 23 - year - old @entity74 from the nearby village of @entity224 however said ' a lot of people ' had been ' killed by the terrorists ' , adding the government offensive was necessary ' so that @entity16 returns to normal			1
' the @entity12 , some 40 kilometers ( 25 miles ) west of @entity229 and just north of the @entity97 border , caught the eye of a young @entity232 before he became @entity11			1
@entity232 lauded its beauty and called it one of the world 's greatest castles			2
it dominates the surrounding valley and terraced hills below and once was one of the crown jewels of @entity16 tourism before its three - year - old conflict began			1
the @entity12 , some 40 kilometres west of @entity229 and just north of the @entity97 border , caught the eye of a young @entity232 before he became @entity11 the site of the castle was first inhabited during the 11th century by a settlement of @entity247 , but was handed to the @entity248 who built the castle between 1142 and 1271			1
it held out a number of fierce attacks , including one by the @entity8 warrior @entity7 , before it was taken by @entity255 , in 1271 , following a 36 day siege			2
it is like many of the country 's most significant historical sites , caught in the crossfire in a conflict that activists say has killed more than 150,000 people			2
some sites have been turned into military bases			0
@entity267 has smashed historic mosques , churches and markets			0
looters have stolen artifacts from excavations and museums			0
journalists from @entity1 reconstructed the battle for @entity12 after talking to @entity16 soldiers and local residents during a rare trip by @entity281 media to the castle since its capture by government troops in march			1
@entity12 was one of five crusader fortifications protecting the @entity287 , the major pass between @entity289 in @entity290 and @entity291 in @entity97			2
the site , which was first inhabited during the 11th century by a settlement of @entity247 , was handed to the @entity294 who built the castle and expanded it between 1142 and 1271			2
at its peak the castle held a garrison of about 2,000 and was said to be unbreachable			0
with its three metre thick walls and seven guard towers , the castle held out several fierce attacks during the time it was occupied by the @entity294 , including one by the @entity8 warrior @entity7			2
the @entity35 castle @entity12 ( pictured in 2006 ) which at its peak held a garrison of about 2,000 and was said to be unbreachable it was eventually taken by the @entity255 , in 1271 , following a 36 day siege , after they supposedly tricked the inhabitants to surrender by way of a forged letter purportedly from the @entity312			1
@entity314 familiarity with the @entity35 castles fell after the @entity316 were driven from the @entity317 in 1291			0
a renewed interest during the 19th century however led to an investigation of the castle and architecural plans were drawn up			0
a settlement , which had taken residence within the castle in the late 19th or early 20th century , was removed in 1933 after causing damage to the building 's fabric			1
it was handed over to the @entity330 state before @entity16 assumed control of it after declaring independence in 1946 .			2

the @entity12 has fallen victim to the chaos of @entity16 's civil war following siege by @entity19 forces
@entity340 and rebels used the castle as a last refuge following heavy bombardment last winter
government forces then seized the building in march , damaging the walls and roof with heavy artillery and an airstrike
