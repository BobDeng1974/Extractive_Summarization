by @entity0 @entity1 : 04:13 est , 19 december 2013 @entity2 : 08:34 est , 19 december 2013 a £ 2 billion @entity4 probe that will map more than a billion stars in @entity6 has been launched into our galaxy			1
the two - tonne observatory blasted into orbit on a @entity13 @entity12 rocket from the @entity4 space port in @entity15 at 09:12 gmt this morning			1
its five - year mission is one of the most ambitious in space history and its aim is to pinpoint millions of stars with unparalleled precision			2
it is also hoped @entity24 will discover thousands of previously unknown objects , including exploding stars , planets orbiting other suns , and nearby asteroids			1
it is being sent into space to survey stars in nearby galaxies and and find clues about dark matter @entity24 , pictured , is fitted with a @entity40 camera that will also hunt for planets and asteroids			1
it cost £ 620million to build and the project cost a total of £ 2billion the purpose of the @entity24 mission is to create a precise @entity6 map of the @entity49			1
the billion stars that @entity24 will map is still only one per cent of the @entity49 's total number of stars			1
it is @entity4 's successor to the @entity56 satellite which mapped around 100,000 stars			2
@entity56 was the very first mission for measuring astrometry - the positions , distances , motions , brightness and colours of stars			0
it is hoped @entity24 will find also reveal new asteroids , dead stars , and test current theories about our cosmos			1
its map will also become a reference frame to guide the investigations of future telescopes			0
scientists also hope @entity24 will yield clues about mysterious dark matter and dark energy			1
dark matter is an invisible substance that glues galaxies together , yet can not be detected other than by observing its gravitational effects			1
dark energy is a strange propulsive force that appears to be hard - wired into the fabric of space itself and is causing galaxies to fly apart at an accelerating rate			2
the probe will also be able to detect far - off solar systems with their own families of planets , and , closer to home , spot potentially threatening asteroids whose orbits reach out as far as @entity97			2
@entity99 scientists and engineers have played key roles in the design and construction of the spacecraft , called @entity24			1
the observatory will operate from a stable location 1.5 million kilometres from the @entity97 known as the @entity107			0
the observatory , pictured left and right during takeoff , will operate from a stable location 1.5 million kilometres from the @entity97 known as the @entity111 lagrangian point			0
situated with the @entity97 shielding it from the @entity114 , the craft will be perfectly placed to observe the wider universe the probe will also be able to detect far - off solar systems with their own families of planets , and spot potentially threatening asteroids			2
as it spins slowly , two telescopes on board @entity24 , pictured , will sweep across the sky and simultaneously focus their light on the largest digital camera ever put into space situated with the @entity97 shielding it from the @entity114 , the craft will be perfectly placed to observe the wider universe			1
as it spins slowly , two telescopes will sweep across the entire sky and simultaneously focus their light on the largest digital camera ever put into space			2
@entity24 's predecessor was the @entity56 satellite , pictured , which mapped around 100,000 stars mission scientist professor @entity133 , from the @entity134 , said : ' @entity24 is one of the most exciting space missions i have worked on during my career			1
its survey of the @entity139 will be in unprecedented detail and the precision of the distance measurements it makes will transform astronomy and our understanding of the universe			0
' professor @entity148 , from @entity149 , the @entity99 's principal @entity24 investigator , added : ‘ the results from @entity24 will revolutionise our understanding of the cosmos as never before			2
‘ our understanding of what 's out there has been driven by looking at what we can see			0
' we 've never had a genuine opportunity to look at everything , to know what 's there , and to know where they are in relation to each other			0
‘ we do n't even know how much we do n't know - there are sure to be objects out there that do n't even have names yet , since we do n't yet realise how strange they are			0
’ the @entity49 , an artist 's impression is pictured , is a spiral galaxy believed to be between 100,000 and 120,000 light - years in diameter			0
the billion stars that @entity24 is expected to map is still only one per cent of this galaxy 's total number of stars @entity99 universities and companies have won around £ 67 million worth of contracts from the @entity32 to build key components of the spacecraft , including its camera sensors and micro-propulsion system			1
a state - of - the - art processing centre at @entity149 will sift and digest massive amounts of raw data from the probe			0
dr @entity190 , manager of @entity24 data processing in the @entity99 , said : ‘ the sensors on board the spacecraft will be able to detect objects so faint the human eye would have to be nearly 4,000 times more powerful to see them			0
‘ this accuracy is equivalent to measuring a shirt button on the moon as seen from the @entity97			0
it means we have to have the highest - capability computers to analyse the data			0
’ a state - of - the - art processing centre at @entity149 will sift and digest massive amounts of raw data collected by the cameras the probe the @entity24 craft is tested in a lab in @entity15 before it was launched			1
it is @entity4 's successor to the @entity56 satellite which mapped around 100,000 stars			0

the @entity32 launched the satellite from @entity15
called @entity24 , it is being sent into space to survey stars in nearby galaxies
fitted with a @entity224 camera and will also hunt for planets and asteroids
@entity24 cost £ 620million to build and the project cost a total of £ 2billion
set to explore the galaxy for five years and look for clues to dark matter
