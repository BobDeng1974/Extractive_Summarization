@entity0 has inspired more ill will among @entity2 than the radical group @entity3 - at least according to the popularity of a @entity6 petition calling for the deportation of the troubled @entity9 singer			1
the petition created by a @entity12 resident asking to eject 19 - year - old pop star from the @entity2 and have his green card revoked has drawn nearly 261,000 signatures as of friday morning , becoming the second most popular cause in the three - year history of the @entity6 site			1
at 204,500 signatures , a petition to declare the extremist @entity3 a terrorist organization is a distant second , followed by a plea to pardon @entity25 leaker @entity24 in third with 153,000 signatures			0
according to the policy of the website launched in 2011 , any petition that raises 100,000 signatures in 30 days must be taken under consideration by the @entity53 administration - a threshold that the @entity0 plea easily met last month			2
the call to action was made january 23 by @entity57 , 24 , of @entity12 , following @entity0 's humiliating arrest for allegedly drag - racing a @entity34 under the influence and with an expired license in @entity35			2
' @entity61 feel that we are being wrongly represented in the world of pop culture			0
we would like to see the dangerous , reckless , destructive , and drug abusing , @entity0 deported and his green card revoked , ' the petition reads			1
rough patch : the 19 - year - old vocalist has been charged with assaulting a limo driver in @entity72 in december ( left ) and he also faces @entity73 charged in @entity35 ( right ) @entity75 youth : @entity0 , pictured here in an @entity78 photo from last week , has been the subject of numerous reports about his suspected drug use and casual flings ' he is not only threatening the safety of our people but he is also a terrible influence on our nations youth			2
we the people would like to remove @entity0 from our society			0
' @entity90 later explained that he used the tongue - in - cheek plea to kick @entity0 out of the country as a way to draw attention to the problems with the @entity6 petition portal , which he said foreign powers have been using to jockey for the attention of the @entity2 government			1
‘ i feel like i finally brought @entity2 together on an issue for once , ’ mr. @entity102 quipped to the @entity36 this week			0
the @entity6 has said that it will issue an official response to the @entity0 petition now that it has raised more than the required 100,000 signatures , but there is no timetable yet for when the statement will come			1
historically , the administration has been slow to respond to petitions , and the responses are usually formulaic and of little note			0
but the signatories of the @entity6 plea are evidently not the only ones who wish to see @entity0 pack up his bags and hit the road north			0
high stakes : this electronic billboard went up in @entity122 this week ahead of friday 's @entity2 - @entity9 hockey game a company in @entity125 has paid for a large billboard ahead of today 's high - stake hockey game between the @entity2 and @entity9 in @entity128 poking fun at the star - crossed teen idol , as @entity131 first reported			1
the electronic advertisement , which went up along @entity133 in @entity122 , depicts the singer flanked by @entity136 's @entity135 and @entity138 's @entity137 with a caption that reads : ' @entity140			0
' as luck would have it , the @entity2 will get to keep the singer after all : @entity136 lost to @entity9 1 - 0 friday			1
the ' baby ' singer , who turns 20 next month , has had a particularly rough year , which included an arrest in @entity9 for an assault on a limo driver , allegations that he had egged his neighbor 's home in @entity152 , and a series of salacious tales of his one - night - stands .			0
