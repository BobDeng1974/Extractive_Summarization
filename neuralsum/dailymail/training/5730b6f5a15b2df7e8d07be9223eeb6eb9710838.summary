when @entity2 's sister set him the challenge to unicycle more than 15,000km around @entity4 to raise awareness for breast cancer , there was no way he could refuse			1
the 36 - year - old former @entity9 actor , who currently lives in @entity11 , had spent his whole life supporting his sister @entity13 , 37 , who has battled cancer on three separate occasions			1
but @entity13 , a mother - of - two who had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and given only six months to live , had more in mind than just simply raising $ 1 million for the @entity19 – she wanted to save her brother			1
@entity2 and @entity21 started the @entity23 campaign in an effort to raise money for breast cancer research and encourage women to check their breasts @entity13 also designed the campaign , which would see her younger brother unicycle around @entity4 , to make sure @entity31 , who had been suffering from depression and addiction , was ok when she died ' @entity13 designed @entity23 not just to raise awareness for breast cancer , but to put me on the right track before she died – it was her devious attempt to fix me up , ' @entity2 told @entity39			1
@entity2 , who had lost his girlfriend to suicide in 2006 , was suffering from depression and addiction when @entity13 was told that her breast cancer had spread to her liver , pelvis , spine and knee			1
' i 've always been her problematic brother and i suppose i was n't doing too well when she got sick , ' he said			0
' i just was n't the happiest i can be and i was n't trying to be the best person i could be - i was kind of just distracted by the miscreant in me and her terminal diagnosis was a great wakeup call and she was determined that i find some of the happiness that she found in life , ' he said			0
as far as siblings go , @entity13 and @entity2 were like two peas in a pod , despite @entity2 describing their childhood relationship as ' a tempestuous bond '			1
@entity13 's whole life has been dominated by cancer since she was first diagnosed with a rare aggressive bone tumour at 11 - years - old at 22 , she was diagnosed with cancer again after a tumour was found in her womb			1
four years ago , the mother - of - two found out she had breast cancer which had spread to her liver , pelvis , spine and knee together , they 've been through more than most			0
after losing their mother to suicide at a young age , @entity13 was diagnosed with a rare aggressive bone tumour at 11 - years - old			2
at 22 , she was diagnosed with cancer again after a tumour was found in her womb			0
after beating both illnesses , @entity13 was diagnosed with breast cancer four years ago and , after initial tests said she had won that fight too , later assessments revealed that the cancer had spread all over her body , rendering her condition ' terminal '			2
' my childhood memories kick in on the day my dad told me that my sister had cancer - i do n't really remember a time when @entity13 was n't fighting cancer			1
it has dominated her life , ' @entity2 said			0
the campaign saw @entity2 break the world record for the longest distance travelled on a unicycle @entity2 farewells @entity13 before his @entity4 - wide trip : the 36 - year - old rode over 15,000km around the country in just under a year and raised over $ 1.9 million for cancer research ' after decades of fighting and winning , she 's been told now that she 's going to lose after all that effort			1
' luckily , @entity13 has always had a great thirst for life			0
in the immediate aftermath of her terminal diagnosis , she decided she wanted to prevent other young mums from experiencing exactly what she was going through			0
' and so the @entity116 campaign was born and @entity2 found himself breaking the world record for the longest distance travelled on a unicycle by riding over 15,000km around the country in just under a year			2
@entity31 said he ' cycled into every town , jumped on my pink soapbox and screamed the message out to anyone that would listen ' - from juvenile justice centres , nursing homes and bikie gangs to the more standard fare of schools , community events , gala balls and grass - roots fundraisers the duo have also released a book , a part memoir for @entity13 , about @entity2 's adventures and @entity13 's life - long cancer battle he raised over $ 1.9 million for breast cancer research during the campaign , in which he says he ' cycled into every town , jumped on my pink soapbox and screamed the message out to anyone that would listen ' - from juvenile justice centres , nursing homes and bikie gangs to the more standard fare of schools , community events , gala balls and grass - root fundraisers			1
@entity13 and @entity2 have also written a book about their life adventure together , a part memoir for @entity13 , which was released just last week			2
but they 're not done yet			0
the siblings have admitted that they are currently concreting plans to unicycle around @entity160 while also planning a secret fundraiser in @entity4 that @entity2 describes as ' an epic fundraiser that would no doubt trump our efforts on the unicycle '			1
the siblings say they are currently concreting plans to unicycle around @entity160 to raise $ 10 million for cancer research , while also planning a secret ' epic ' fundraiser in @entity4 ' if @entity171 is reading this , i really want to unicycle @entity160 with him , ' @entity2 said of the @entity174 born comedian and actor			1
' he can even come on a two - wheeler , but i get bored out of my brain on that thing eight to nine hours a day and ca n't think of a better bloke to ride with			0
' since completing his challenge , @entity2 admits that he considers himself a changed and lucky man , especially as his sister managed to buy some time with a hormone treatment that temporarily stabilised her condition			2
' i 've got a great hunger for life now , my curiosity has been reactivated and i 'm finding great joy and optimism in saying " yes "			0
i 'm a better person because of my sister 's illness and what she 's decided to do about it , ' @entity2 said			2
' @entity13 has experienced a great year of stability , but the cancer is active again so things are going downhill a little			0
obviously we are all , as always , alert and trying not to be alarmed			0
' love your sister , the book , can be bought by visiting @entity201 .			0
