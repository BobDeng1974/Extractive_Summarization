thugs @entity29 , 47 , and 43 - year old @entity26 were suspected to have carried out the attack because the victim was wearing @entity1 - like clothing			1
miss @entity10 later told police : ' since this attack i have been left with a constant reminder of what these vile people did to me			1
' i can not smile properly and every time i do i can feel the muscle in my cheek which is not attached			1
' every time i touch my left eye but stings			1
every morning when i wake up it is an immediate reaction , i am constantly reminded of it eight months after			1
' ' i have confidence because i feel there is a permanent reminder because of the effect of the left hand side of her face			1
@entity62 of the attack in which @entity29 ( in black jacket ) headbutts red head @entity10 and stamps on her			1

i feel the attack has changed my personality			1
' she said she had been left ' traumatised ' and does n’t go out in @entity22 after dark and always goes home early			1
the attack had chilling echoes of the killing in 2008 of @entity1 student @entity5 , 20 , who was beaten to death by two teenagers in a park in @entity87 , @entity88 simply because of the long dark clothing she was wearing			1
today , tattoeed @entity29 laughed in the dock as he was jailed for six years and nine months after he admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent and assault			2

both denied targeting the victims because of their clothing			2
miss @entity10 and @entity24 watched from the public gallery as judge @entity102 told both men : ' it was an appalling explosion of violence on two young people			1
' the public are extremely concerned by the prominence of violence which can be found in our cities and towns day in and day out			2
' people minding their own business could be subjected to vicious attacks for no reason leaving them with injuries or serious injuries whether fuelled by drink or another reason			2
chilling echo : @entity5 , 20 , who was killed by two youths because of the way she was dressed ' it is a mark on our society which causes the greatest of concerns			1
in the case of both of you , you are in your forties and both of you are mature men			2
you should have been able to restrain yourself from the disgraceful conduct			2
' he added : ' we do not know what happened before that but one can see what may well have been an exchange of comments			2
' @entity29 in response to perhaps something which was said or being said to you came across and head butted the young woman with such force that she was propelled across the width of the carriage she could be seen getting to her feet			2
' she was upset that she had been assaulted in that way by a mature man and this shockingly horrific display of violence beggars belief			2
' @entity159 could not stop , you stamped on this young woman ’s head with your boots and foot which caused the injuries			1
the effects of what you did must be distressing for her			2
' not only is it painful when she wakes up and throughout the day but she has lost her confidence because people notice and this has had the effect of changing her personality			2
' this traumatic experience will stay with her for a long time to come			0
' miss @entity10 and mr @entity33 were returning home from a night out in @entity22 in october last year and were on board a tram at the @entity21 platform when they were attacked by the two men			1

she got up and kicked out at the tram doors but @entity29 then bundled her into the corner as other passengers looked on in horror			0
he repeatedly punched @entity10 and viciously stamped on her head and face five times as she is lay between two seats			1
@entity26 thumped mr @entity33 and aimed two punches at @entity193 before running off			0

' @entity29 of @entity217 , @entity23 , had committed 77 previous offences between 1980 and 2010 including assaulting a police officer and public order matters			0
his counsel @entity221 : ' he has been sickened watching the @entity62 footage			0
he had had a drink and was intoxicated			0
he became aware of two people coming down the escalator saying ' tramp ' and ' scumbag ' and in response he pushed her			0
' he accepts that he lost it			0
he bears no prejudice on people who are @entity233 or who dress in that way			0
he accepts his actions were beyond acceptable			0
' in mitigation for @entity26 , of @entity239 , @entity23 , defence counsel @entity237 said : ' there is no doubt the two parties did not like the look of each other			0
but whatever was said that is not an excuse			0

i have lost my faith in society			0
it ’s had a giant impact on me			0
