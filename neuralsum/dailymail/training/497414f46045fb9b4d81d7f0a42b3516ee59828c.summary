by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 09:04 est , 25 september 2013 updated : 09:26 est , 25 september 2013 at least 350 federal background checks for security clearances have been faked by corrupt employees in the last eight years , a shocking new report reveals			1
authorities have arrested 21 contractors and special agents working for the @entity10 from 2004 to 2012 for lying about thoroughly researching candidates for ' secret ' and ' top secret ' government security clearances			1
seven of those employees worked for @entity14 , a @entity15 - based company that has come under scrutiny for its role in vetting former @entity20 contractor @entity18 and more recently , @entity23 shooter @entity21			1
questions : @entity23 shooter @entity21 , left , and to @entity20 leaker @entity18 , right , were both granted government security clearances - leading to questions about whether background checking is too lax last week , @entity21 - who had ' secret ' security clearance despite a history of run - ins with the police and reports of mental instability - killed 13 people and wounded three others in a rampage at the @entity23			1
in one case corruption case , a private contractor investigator , who pleaded guilty to making a false statement , reported interviewing a person who had died more than a decade earlier			0
another investigator was found guilty of making false statements in checks for applicants seeking ' top secret ' clearances for jobs in the @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity23 and @entity51			1
@entity52 discovered the 350 known cases of background check fraud by reviewing court documents and press releases from prosecutors for 21 cases resulting in convictions that involved the making of false statements from december 2004 to march 2012			1
these are the cases government officials have cited to assert that action is taken against investigators who falsely claim to have reviewed records or done interviews for background checks submitted to @entity10			2
not all the cases identified a specific number of fabrications			0
investigated : @entity14 , a government contractor who does the bulk of the government background screening for security clearances , is under investigation for its ties to both @entity18 and @entity21 the 350 falsified reports represent only a small percentage of the number of background investigations conducted each year , either by @entity10 's own investigators or a handful of private contractors it uses for most of the work			1
the @entity86 testified to a congressional committee in june that @entity10 received over $ 1 billion to conduct more than 2 million background investigations for government employees in fiscal 2011			2
but the details of the cases show how cracks in the system may allow employees to obtain clearances without proper vetting			0
the highest number of convictions , 11 , involved special agents for @entity10			0
another seven convictions were of employees of @entity14 , two of those @entity14 investigators had the highest number - more than four dozen each - of flawed background check reports sent to @entity10 , court documents showed			1
@entity14 faces an ongoing investigation by @entity10 's inspector general			0
the company declined to comment for this story and @entity10 's inspector general 's office would not comment on its probe			0
tragic : @entity21 killed 13 people after waltzing past security at the @entity23 because he had been granted ' secret ' clearance the most severe punishment was given to an investigator who did not take a plea agreement and instead went to trial			1
this investigator was found guilty of six counts of making false statements and sentenced to 27 months in prison			0
those who entered plea agreements generally received sentences of probation and community service , courts records show			0
@entity130 , @entity131 in a statement last week after 13 people died in shootings at the @entity23 , including shooter @entity21 , the @entity135 for the @entity136 said , ' in light of recent events , we plan to step up our efforts to investigate and prosecute the individuals and companies who risk our security by cutting corners and falsifying information in background checks			1
' in pressing the cases , prosecutors have required defendants to pay more than $ 1.5 million in restitution to the @entity153 government to recover the costs of redoing improper background investigations			0
the screening process for security clearances has came under heightened scrutiny this year since @entity18 , working as a contract employee assigned to the @entity20 , used his ' top - secret ' clearance to access documents on the agency 's electronic eavesdropping that he later gave to the news media			2
the issue resurfaced last week with reports that @entity21 held a ' secret ' security clearance despite violent episodes before and after he received it			2
a secret clearance generally lasts 10 years			2
ongoing checks are needed because ' in five to 10 years stuff happens and people change , ' a @entity173 aide said on condition of anonymity			0
the @entity23 shooting has led lawmakers to call for a review of the background check process and a re-examination of the way employees are granted clearance @entity10 contracts out for most of the background check work			1
but the decision to grant security clearances rests with the government agency that intends to employ the individual			0
@entity14 conducts about 65 percent of the background checks done by private contractors , and more than half of all the investigations conducted by the @entity10 , according to a statement issued last week by the office of senator @entity195 , a @entity197 @entity196 who is a co-sponsor of legislation aimed at boosting oversight of the security clearance process			1
investigators for other government contractors , including @entity204 , were also convicted of making false statements in reports for security clearance background checks			1
@entity204 did not immediately respond to a request for comment			0
a @entity173 aide said the @entity14 investigation by @entity10 's inspector general revolves around systemic problems in the company 's procedures and does not focus on individual investigators			2
the inspector general also is investigating the background check done for @entity21 before he received clearance to work for the @entity23			1
in 2012 , there were 3.5 million federal employees and 1.1 million contractors who held a ' secret ' or ' top secret ' clearance and @entity10 's security clearance and background investigations cost about $ 1 billion , @entity195 's office said			1
the @entity10 inspector general 's office told @entity52 it has 68 open cases related to @entity10 's background investigations program			0
it did not say how many of those involve report falsifications			0
the inspector general 's office said it has referred 22 former background investigators for debarment , but no decisions have been reached by @entity10			0
a debarment is usually for a specific time period and means the person can not contract with another federal agency			0
the @entity243 has scheduled an october 1 hearing on government clearances and background checks .			2

federal prosecutors have charged 21 federal employees and contractors with lying about vetting candidates for ' secret ' or ' top secret ' clearance
seven arrests for employees for @entity14 , the company that checked out @entity18 and @entity21
two @entity14 employees admitted to falsifying background checks for four dozen government employees and contractors apiece
