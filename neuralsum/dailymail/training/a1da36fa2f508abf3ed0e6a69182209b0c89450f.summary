@entity14 met the @entity6 star nearly five years ago when @entity4 and business partner @entity16 came to him with the idea of doing a documentary about the homeless problem in @entity4 ’s hometown of @entity21 , @entity22			1
it was only after discussing the issue in depth that @entity4 and @entity16 both revealed they lived on the streets as students			1
the 40 - year - old , who tragically lost his life in a car crash on november 30 , studied @entity30 at @entity31			1
@entity14 says : ‘ @entity16 and @entity4 were homeless for a while in college and related to the issue			1
@entity16 mentioned that he had been living out his car and a lot of students lived out of cars or in homeless shelters , they still do now , as they ca n’t afford the tuition fees , there ’s no such thing as food stamps , and rents are so high			1
‘ they said it was for a brief time and they knew it was a world of difference to the people that live on the streets for virtually their whole life			1
' but this made them really interested in the subject , it bothered them , and they picked @entity21 , where you see it all the time			1
there are so many mentally ill people on the streets , it ’s heartbreaking			2
’ the sounds of high - performance car engines filled the air sunday as more than 5,000 fans , friends and car enthusiasts headed to the @entity1 suburb of @entity76 to pay tribute to @entity4 at the site where the ' @entity6 ' actor died in a car crash			1
the memorial , planned through social media , was scheduled to begin at noon , but mourners began arriving hours beforehand to leave flowers , candles , stuffed animals and other tributes			0
after speaking to @entity14 , who ’s been a social worker and campaigner in the area for the last 35 years , they realized the problem was much deeper and more complex than they could ever imagine			1
the trio filmed for a year in 2009 centering on four people – three women and a blind old man called ' @entity95 ' – who were sleeping rough and being cared for by @entity14 and his team			1
thousands of people and hundreds of cars and motorcycles turned out to pay their respects mourners : thousands of people turned out for a memorial in @entity76 , @entity22 , to pay tribute to @entity4 and friend @entity110 , right , who died in the crash more than 5,000 people came to the gathering , which was planned on social media			1
it was set to begin at noon sunday , but hundreds of people lined up hours early ‘ they wanted to follow me around , as they wanted to see the homeless through their eyes			2
they did n’t want the people who were being filmed to be conscious of it			0
they wanted to concentrate on the town as it has this huge homeless population and it also has this massive wealth			1
we have a city as rich as @entity21 and they let @entity95 live on the streets			1
‘ i found pops on the streets and we had to carry him into the homeless shelter			2
most people do n’t want to touch the homeless ; they ’re like lepers			2
but @entity16 was the one who lifted him up and took him on his shoulders to take him to the shelter			2
‘ the homeless are treated like a hidden wound and it grated on the guys that there is all this wealth in the area , all these celebrities , and also @entity154 poverty , which everyone just blindly accepts			0
‘ you just do n’t usually get that empathy out of @entity158			0
we have lots of celebrities who live here and you do n’t get that sort of compassion			0
’ activist : @entity14 , a social worker who helps look after the homeless population in @entity166 , was impressed by @entity4 's passion even though @entity4 was also busy filming the third installment of the @entity6 franchise , he was still heavily involved in producing the documentary and even had time to turn up to @entity14 ’s book launch , a novel about a @entity174 veteran			1
‘ in the middle of filming , i released a book called @entity178 and , out of nowhere , both @entity16 and @entity4 turn up to the launch			1
@entity4 ’s in jeans and a baseball cap , he was just so unassuming			2
' but he said he understood the book , as his dad is a @entity174 vet			0
i could n’t believe , who am i ? i ’m a no one			0
‘ but that ’s @entity4			2
they were doing this documentary and @entity4 was having to commute from @entity189 where he was filming @entity6			1
they really left their comfort zone to do this			0
they ’d never done anything like it and it was n’t going to get them any kudos			0
‘ for @entity4 , i go back to how humble he was			2
he had all this other stuff going on , but he wanted to do this , it speaks volumes			0
it was so chaotic and difficult to do			0
' i give both of them credit , there ’s no more controversial subject in @entity206 , and they wanted to reach out as best they could , and they took time out to do it			0
they had no @entity158 ego			0
' three hundred people have died on @entity21 streets from the likes of hypothermia and just plain giving up			1
you get wet and you ’re cold all night , you use drugs or drink so you do n’t feel it and forget all your problems			0
no one cares - but they did			0
’ unbelievably , @entity4 , @entity16 and @entity14 all received hate mail for the work they did with the homeless			1
‘ it ’s weird , people hate the homeless and people were writing to me , saying they loathed me			2
when we did this film , we got a lot of criticism , ’ explains @entity14			2
@entity232 : even the mega-stardom that the success of the @entity6 films brought to @entity4 , right , caused him to lose sight of his days on the streets @entity4 died tragically last month when the $ 500,000 supercar he was riding in smashed into a light pole and burst into flames ‘ we had hateful comments , which gave me an even higher opinion of them that these guys from @entity158 were bothering to do this			1
‘ people were saying that the homeless are like pigeons , and you know what happens with them ... you feed them , then the pigeons will overpopulate			0
they ’d say it ’s time to " thin the herd , " which means when there ’s too much of a herd , then they bring the hunters into kill them			0
‘ others would say we do n’t have a homeless problem , we have a @entity14 problem			2
’ when the film , called ' shelter , ' was eventually premiered at in july 2009 and they held a charity fundraiser for the @entity263 , which @entity14 has worked tirelessly for decades			1
@entity4 's teenage daughter @entity265 left a touching tribute to her father on her @entity269 page in which she called him her hero ‘ @entity4 ’s like an angel compared to most in @entity158			2
they never wanted special treatment and they put their neck on their line when there ’s so much prejudice against the homeless			0
when the film came out , they put me down as co-producer			0
for me it was unbelievable , that means a lot , ’ says @entity14			0
as @entity4 knew from the beginning , @entity263 would never even stand a chance of hitting the cinemas , but he was only interested in making a difference to the @entity21 community , says @entity14			1
he adds : ‘ it ’s still being shown in classrooms , college campuses and community events , it ’s made a real impact			0
' we wanted to break the stereotypes and see them as human beings , demystify the homeless , and try to look at ways of solving the problem			0
they ’re so badly treated - if you ’re poor , you ’re scum			0
it chipped away at the prejudice			0
‘ this says something about the problem that two of the four homeless people we filmed are now dead			1
it was amazing what @entity4 and @entity16 did and if it makes more people take notice , then it was worth it			1

@entity6 star was forced to live on the streets when he was at @entity31 in @entity21
