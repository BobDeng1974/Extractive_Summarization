to the naked eye , a chicken nugget may seem like a relatively healthy and wholesome treat , but under the glare of a microscope the offal truth is revealed			0
dr @entity6 , a professor of medicine and pediatrics at @entity9 , said that he was ' floored ' and ' astounded ' when he took a closer look at the make - up of the ubiquitous all - american meal			0
when dr @entity6 and pathologist @entity16 sliced into a pair of randomly selected nuggets - bought from two different fast - foot chains - they discovered a jumble of blood vessels , fat , cartilage , but not a whole lot of actual chicken meat			1
the offal truth : when researchers placed a pair of chicken nuggets from two fast - food chains under the microscope , they discovered a concoction of blood vessels , fat , intestinal tissue , but little actual meat what 's in a nugget ? researchers in @entity40 examined two fast - food chains ' chicken nuggets and found that half or less than half of the nuggets were made of meat			1
the rest was made of high - fat chicken parts a study of the chicken from the first restaurant revealed that it was 50 per cent muscle			1
the other half of the nugget was made up of fat , blood vessels , nerve and epithelium tissue from birds ’ cavities			1
the nutritional breakdown was 56 per cent fat , 25 per cent carbs and 19 per cent protein , according to the @entity63			0
the nugget from the second restaurant was 40 per cent skeletal muscle , a mix of fat and connective and organ tissue , as well as bone debris			0
dr @entity73 compared nuggets served in some national franchises to ‘ super glue ’ , comprised of bits of poultry leftovers mashed up with fatty ‘ goo ’ and fried in salty batter			0
the scientist insisted that calling the product ' chicken nuggets ' is misleading , because they are mostly fat tissue rather than actual poultry meat			2
' what has happened is that some companies have chosen to use an artificial mixture of chicken parts rather than low - fat chicken white meat , batter it up and fry it and still call it chicken , ' dr @entity6 said			1
' it is really a chicken by - product high in calories , salt , sugar and fat that is a very unhealthy choice			2
even worse , it tastes great and kids love it and it is marketed to them			0
' the @entity103 , a non-profit group that represents @entity105 's poultry producers , has dismissed dr @entity6 's finding , arguing that nuggets are ' an excellent source of protein ' - especially for children who tend to be finicky eaters			2
but according to dr @entity6 and healthy - eating advocate and renowned chef @entity113 , that is part of the problem			0
according to @entity113 , @entity105 ’s kids have been ' brainwashed ' to such a degree that even if they know that nuggets are mostly made of goo and bone bits , they would still happily eat them			0
the problem is especially acute in dr @entity6 's home state of @entity40 , which has the highest rate of childhood obesity in the country			2
do n't make it a habit : dr @entity6 , the lead researcher of the study , said it 's ok to eat chicken nuggets every once in a while but he 's concerned for the people who eat them multiple times a week by 2030 , @entity40 is projected to have the highest obesity rate at 66.7 per cent			1
@entity137 , a representative of the @entity103 , pointed out that nutritional information for most fast food chains is available online , and that anything for sale at the grocery store has a list of ingredients			1
' chicken nuggets tend to have an elevated fat content because they are breaded and fried			2
but it 's no secret what is in a chicken nugget , ' she said			0
to counter claims similar to the ones laid out in @entity157 's study , @entity152 and @entity153 have been running ads touting their chicken nuggets as made entirely of breast meat .			1

researchers in @entity40 examined chicken nuggets at two different fast - food chains and found that only about half of the nuggets were made of muscle meat
the rest of the nuggets were made of other chicken parts like fat , blood vessels , nerves , bones and cartilage
a representative for the @entity103 said it 's no mystery what 's in chicken nuggets since nutritional information is often available online or on the *packaging*
