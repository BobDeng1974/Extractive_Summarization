by @entity0 published : 08:23 est , 29 march 2013 updated : 08:28 est , 29 march 2013 you have heard of the @entity2 but these rare white lion cubs are giving an @entity5 twist on the spring bank holiday			0
just four days old , the sleepy eyed cubs are seen rolling around these colourful @entity2 eggs with handler , @entity9 , at the @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12			1
ms @entity9 , 24 , from @entity13 , is responsible for caring for the rare white lion cubs who are two of just 50 in their native country of @entity12			2
baby white lion cubs just four days old play with @entity2 eggs at the @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 the two rare cubs were bred at @entity11 's @entity10 which specialises in white lions @entity21 are not albinos , but a genetic rarity unique to the @entity25 region			1
like blue eyes in humans , the animals ' white colour is caused by a recessive gene shared by both parents			0
the earliest recorded sighting of white lions in the @entity25 region was in 1938			2
however , the oral records of @entity5 elders indicate that these unique animals survived in this region for many centuries			0
since their discovery white lions have been hunted , and forcibly removed from their natural endemic habitat			2
the baby white lions are cared for by @entity9 ( left ) at @entity11 's @entity10 in @entity12 the white lion species is endangered because their light coats make it harder for them to camouflage the last white lion was seen in the wild in 1994 , after which time they were technically extinct in the wild			1
the survival of white lions has been attributed by some to their very whiteness meaning they lack the camouflage of the tawny lions			2
the @entity56 has specialised in breeding programmes designed to discourage the inter-breeding of the white lion and have agreements with other white lion breeders to ensure genetic integrity			0
white lions are native to only the @entity25 region of @entity12 , an area characterised by white sandy riverbeds and long grass scorched pale by the sun. they are regarded as sacred animals by the people of that region , but after @entity70 ' discovered ' them in the 1970s , many were taken from the wild to captive breeding and hunting operations			1
these removals , along with lion culling and trophy hunting of male lions , depleted the gene pool and the animals have been technically extinct in the wild for the past 19 years			0
white lions are native to only the @entity25 region of @entity12 , an area with sandy riverbeds and long grass scorched pale by the sun snuggle up : the four - day - old white lion cubs are two of just 50 white lions in @entity12 in their natural habitat , white lions are regarded as ' apex predators ' , able to hunt successfully in day and night and take down prey as large as giraffes			1
despite their rarity , white lions are not yet classified as endangered because biologists still regard them as ultimately the same as their tawny equivalents			1
the @entity96 is campaigning for white lions to be recognised as a subspecies of lions , so that they can be protected under international law			0
however , the genetic marker that makes white lions unique has not yet been identified by scientists and research into the animals is ongoing			0
the trust estimates that there are no more than 300 white lions in existence			1
in recent years it has reintroduced the animals to a nature reserve within @entity111 in an effort to eventually reintroduce the gene to wild lions .			0

two four - day - old cubs were *photographed* in @entity11 , @entity12
just 300 white lions left in the world , but not treated as endangered
