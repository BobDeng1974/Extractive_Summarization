by @entity0 a @entity2 family are on track to break the @entity5 record after raising more than $ 801,000 to help find a cure for their 4 - year - old daughter 's rare , terminal disorder			1
in just a few short months , @entity12 and @entity11 's campaign has received enough donations to fully fund the medicine required for a clinical trial for their daughter @entity16 syndrome that should hopefully take place later this year			1
the deadly genetic disorder means @entity16 lacks an enzyme to break down heparin sulfate , which naturally occurs in cells , causing it to build up over time and resulting in a variety of medical problems			1
her brother , @entity36 , is pictured with the family big help : in just a few short months , the @entity5 campaign has raised more than $ 801,000 for @entity16 's care while it 's barely detectable in the little girl now , she will lose the ability to speak by her 5th birthday , and the @entity44 say she 'll die before she reaches her 20s			1
faced with this prospect , the caring parents took to social media to help their daughter , given funding for rare diseases is hard to come by			2
according to @entity57 , researchers @entity53 and @entity54 in @entity55 , @entity56 , have been working on a cure for the disorder that affects one in 70,000 babies			0
after about 16 years , they 've found a gene therapy treatment that works in mice and are ready to test it in humans but they need $ 2 million in all to make the clinical trial happen			2
so close : the family are merely thousands away from breaking the @entity5 record , which is currently at $ 808,845 for @entity70 @entity69 sick : the deadly genetic disorder means @entity16 , pictured left , lacks an enzyme to break down heparin sulfate , which naturally occurs in cells , causing it to build up over time and resulting in a variety of medical problems desperate to make the most of this opportunity , @entity80 said he enlisted the help of filmmaker @entity84 after he googled ' how to make a viral video ' and the pair shot a moving story about @entity16 and her condition to launch their @entity5 fundraiser			1
now , thanks to thousands of generous strangers the world over , they have raised enough for the drugs necessary to test the treatment on @entity16 and other @entity97 sufferers			0
' the first major step towards saving our daughter is complete , ' the @entity44 said in a statement yesterday			0
' the medicine will be ready in december and @entity16 and others like her will have the chance to get the treatment they so desperately need			2
' degenerative : while it 's barely detectable in the little girl now , she will lose the ability to speak by her 5th birthday , and the @entity44 say she 'll die before she reaches her 20s not there yet : the @entity44 have a busy summer and fall ahead as they attempt to attract enough donations to pay for the clinical trial to be carried out - another $ 1 million and they are merely thousands away from breaking the @entity5 record , which is currently at $ 808,845 for @entity70 @entity69			1
two other @entity117 victims , @entity118 and @entity119 , are in second place with $ 794,335			0
' the @entity123 's efforts are a true testament of two parents ' unwavering love for their daughter , and the willingness to do whatever it takes to reach their goal , ' @entity5 ceo @entity121 told @entity57 of the impressive feat. however , the family are not there yet			2
the @entity44 have a busy summer and fall ahead as they attempt to attract enough donations to pay for the trial to be carried out - another $ 1 million			1
overall , @entity16 is doing well , her father told @entity57			0
though they are desperate to hit their target			0
' we do notice things related to the syndrome in the way that she processes information , ' @entity11 said			0
' she is not regressing on anything though and still learning - just at a slow pace and behind her peers			0

@entity2 couple @entity12 and @entity11 now have the money to pay for the medicine needed for a clinical trial for @entity16 's @entity16 syndrome
the deadly genetic disorder means @entity16 lacks an enzyme to break down heparin sulfate , causing it to build up over time
this results in a variety of medical problems : she will lose the ability to speak by age five , and likely die before she reaches her 20s
@entity167 took to social media to raise funds for a cure and have *collected* more than $ 801,000
the @entity5 record is currently at $ 808,845 for @entity70 @entity69
however , the @entity44 still need more to *ensure* the clinical trial can be carried out later this year
