by @entity0 published : 04:36 est , 2 july 2012 updated : 08:56 est , 2 july 2012 her devotion to her career and husband has ensured @entity5 a reputation as one of the more down - to - earth royals			1
but the hard - working ethos has not always been her approach to life , her father has admitted			1
@entity5 was ' a brat ' when she was a child , captain @entity14 has revealed - although he readily admits he was not a great father to her and her brother @entity16			1
crossing the line : captain @entity14 , pictured with his daughter on her wedding day , said the sporty 31 - year - old used to be rather disobedient the @entity21 's granddaughter , 31 , is now preparing to compete in the @entity23 eventing team , but there was a time when was far less hard - working and well behaved			1
the ex-husband of the princess royal said he struggled when she was a small child , but tried to instil a sense of responsibility in her as she grew up and had the run of the family 's country pile @entity34 , in @entity35			2
@entity5 's older brother @entity16 ' knew where the line was and he did n’t cross it ' , captain @entity14 told the @entity41 in an interview			1
' @entity5 , on the other hand , who came along four years later , was much more difficult , much more of a brat			1
i do n’t think she accepted that line at all			2
' the siblings were sent to boarding school but returned to the home of their father and @entity51 in the holidays			2
' they knew that to have freedom they had to earn it , ' said @entity55			0
' they also did n’t want their father peering over their shoulder every time they went off and did something by themselves			0
' they knew that if they were going to have a party here , they could have fun , but they also had to respect things			0
so if there was spilled wine on the carpet , or a broken vase on the table , they knew @entity78 , for one , was n’t going to be pleased			0
' naughty little sister : princess @entity51 and @entity14 with baby daughter @entity5 and son @entity16 now and then : @entity5 and husband @entity84 after her show jumping trials , left , and the @entity21 's granddaughter as a child , right the captain later married second wife @entity88 , an @entity89 dressage rider , but recently reportedly left her for equestrian @entity90 , 35			0
he said his son was a ' great father ' to his two daughters with @entity94 wife @entity93			0
' @entity16 has already proved to be a great father — a much better father than i ever was			0
i was never good with small children			0
once @entity16 and @entity5 could walk and talk , and be useful , i could relate to them much more			0
' his son backed up this view , saying his father was not home as much as he would have liked to have been , largely because of his relentless work ethic			0
the 34 - year - old added : ' would i leave my children in the care of my father ? probably not , to put it bluntly			1
i think he ’d possibly get distracted by something horse - related and wander off leaving them			2
' captain @entity14 is coaching the @entity89 eventing team for @entity113 , so is not able to have much contact with @entity5 or lend her support during the competition			1
but he declared himself thrilled for his daughter and delighted she could ' tick the @entity23 box ' after ticking so many others .			1

the 31 - year - old was more ' difficult ' than her brother and ' crossed the line '
she is now preparing to compete in the @entity23 eventing team
