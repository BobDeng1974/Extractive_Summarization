by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 02:59 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 07:13 est , 17 october 2013 a milk rota in a @entity4 office was marked ‘ restricted ’ by mandarins obsessed with security and playing @entity7			1
an official also landed in hot water for leaving a document marked ‘ restricted ’ on a printer , even though it was the only thing written on the sheet of paper			1
cabinet office minister @entity15 said the farce had to end because @entity4 had failed to move with the times			1
sensitive : a document on what days different milk was bought for civil servants to make tea and coffee was marked ' restricted ' by over-zealous security officials now the government 's security classifications are to be dramatically streamlined in a bid to improve communication and save millions of pounds			2
in future all documents will be either top secret , secret or official - after ministers condemned the old six - tier system as a @entity36 relic			1
mr @entity15 ordered the shake - up after learning that a document detailing on what days full fat , semi-skimmed and skimmed milk was bought for civil servants to make tea and coffee was marked ' restricted ' by over-zealous security officials he also found emails could not be sent between the @entity45 and the @entity46 because their servers worked on different security levels			1
instead , staff had to run between the buildings with printouts			2
the old markings of unclassified , protected , restricted and confidential are being merged into a new ‘ official ’ band			0
secret and top secret will remain in place			1
spooks : ministers said the view of spies like @entity7 , pictured , passing top secret documents around @entity4 had not moved with the times mr @entity15 said : ‘ most people ’s image of government security classifications is of @entity66 sliding @entity7 a buff - coloured folder stamped @entity68			1
‘ but where @entity7 ’s cutting - edge gadgets and cars have moved with the times , our security processes are beginning to show their age			2
‘ the existing system is confusing and often misapplied			0
‘ when i heard that a milk rota had been marked as “ restricted ” i knew things had to change , ’ he wrote in @entity77			0
‘ one of my team even got in trouble for leaving a document marked “ restricted ” on the printer – even though it was otherwise entirely blank			2
’ farce : cabinet office @entity15 said he was dismayed at the way blank or innocuous documents were treated as secret most staff will now be issued with ‘ off the shelf ’ computers and mobile devices - such as those used by hospitals - rather than more specialist kit			1
a laptop with government encryption costs around £ 7,000 a year to run , whereas in future one to deal with ‘ official ’ documents could cost £ 1,000			2
a cabinet office source said the reforms were expected to save ‘ many millions of pounds ’			0
more than 700,000 civil servants and military personnel will begin using the new markings from april , with the rest of the public sector following later			0
mr @entity15 is understood to have handed back his top - security government computer and mobile equipment , and now uses devices with lower encryption			1
for documents that require a higher level of protection , he apparently only has paper copies			0
mr @entity15 added : ‘ @entity4 uses a security classification system designed decades ago			1
‘ we are changing that and introducing a new system fit for the digital age			0
it will speed up decisions , make it easier to share information and save hard - working taxpayers ' money			0
‘ there has been a tendency to over mark documents rather than to manage risk properly			0
‘ this can devalue the basic security principles			0
‘ we think the most important and sensitive materials should be protected as ' @entity68 ' or ' @entity68 ' but for other information the new ' @entity137 ' category , with its renewed emphasis upon personal responsibility and accountability , will be appropriate for most of what government does			0

a blank sheet of paper left on a printer was treated as a security *breach*
officials were forced to run around @entity4 with printouts of emails
minister @entity15 says security staff must move with the times
six document categories to be cut to just three : official , secret , top secret
more staff to have ' off the shelf ' computers and mobile phones
