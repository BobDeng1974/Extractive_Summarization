ever wondered why we go grey or most men 's beards have a reddish , ginger tinge ? or why a young child 's golden locks often disappear before the age of 10 ? here , one leading expert , @entity8 , professor of dermatology at the @entity10 and @entity11 , explains the science of hair colour - and why some of us are cursed with more greys than others ... what determines the colour of hair ? hair colour is produced by cells known as melanocytes , which migrate into the hair bulb as the hair follicles develop in utero			1
the melanocytes produce pigment that is incorporated into the growing hair fibres to produce hair in a bewildering array of natural shades			1
hair colour depends on the presence and ratios of two groups of melanins : eumelanins ( brown and black pigments ) and pheomelanins ( red and yellow pigments )			1
while variations in the ratio of these pigments can produce an large number of colours and tones , siblings often have strikingly similar hair colour			1
@entity49 of @entity51 battles with grey hair , as these pictures reveal			1
genetic factors appear to be important in determining when we turn grey , rather than lifestyle , says professor @entity8 most of us find our first ' greys ' by the time we turn 30 , usually at the temples , then later , across the scalp how hair colour varies according to body site for example , eyelashes are the darkest because they contain high levels of eumalanin			1
scalp hair is usually lighter than pubic hair , which often has a red tinge , due to the presence of more phaeomelanin pigments			1
a red tinge is also common in underarm and beard hair , even in people with essentially brown hair on their scalp			1
hormones such as melanocyte - stimulating hormone can darken light hair , as can high levels of oestrogen and progesterone , which are produced in pregnancy			2
certain drugs , such as those to prevent malaria can lighten hair , while some epilepsy medications can darken it			2
why do blonde children often go dark ? blond children tend to see their hair darken around the age or seven or eight			1
the mechanism for this is unknown and probably not related to hormones , as the darkening precedes puberty by a number of years			0
new parents often find the first coat of their baby 's hair is darker than expected			2
it is not until this first hair is shed and replaced , at around eight to 12 months of age , that you get a clear indication of their hair colour			1
blond children tend to see their hair darken around the age or seven or eight.the mechanism for this is unknown and probably not related to hormones , as the darkening precedes puberty by a number of years , says professor @entity8 how much does hair grow ? human hair growth is cyclical			1
during the anagen phase , hair grows continuously at a rate of 1cm per month			2
@entity125 can last three to five years on the scalp and produce hair that grows to between 36 to 60cm in length			1
at the end of the anagen phase , the follicle turns off , hair growth stops and remains off for the three months			2
towards the end of this resting ( telogen ) phase , the hair is shed and the follicle remains empty until the anagen phase of the cycle restarts			2
pigment production also turns on and off in rhythm with the hair cycle			2
when pigment cells turn off at the end of one hair cycle and fail to turn back on with the onset of the next , hair becomes grey			2
how grey is really grey ? most of us find our first ' greys ' by the time we turn 30 , usually at the temples , then later , across the scalp			2
while many people find the salt and pepper look appealing , others go to great lengths to conceal these locks			0
the grey hair ' rule of thumb ' is that by the age of 50 , half of the population have lost the colour in 50 per cent of their hair			1
when researchers tested this rule , they found that 74 per cent of people aged between 45 and 65 had grey hair , with an average intensity of 27 per cent			1
generally , men have more grey hair than women			0
@entity178 and @entity179 have less grey hair than @entity181			0
by the age of 50 ( @entity183 , 42 , is pictured left and @entity184 , 54 , right ) , half of us will be 50 per cent grey , says professor @entity8			1
generally , men have more grey hair than women what causes grey hair ? genetic factors appear to be important in determining when we turn grey			0
identical twins seem to go grey at a similar age , rate and pattern , however we 're yet to identify the controlling genes			0
there is no evidence to link the onset of greying to stress , diet or lifestyle			0
certain autoimmune diseases such as vitiligo and alopecia can damage pigment cells and induce greying			0
however , these conditions are uncommon and can explain only a tiny fraction of greying			0
early greying occurs in premature ageing syndromes such as @entity218 's - progeria and @entity220 syndrome , where every aspect ageing in the body is accelerated			1
premature greying can also be seen in people affected by pernicious anaemia , autoimmune thyroid disease or @entity219			1
so , why does n't pigment production turn back on ? at the end of each hair cycle , some pigment - producing melanocytes become damaged and die			0
if the melanocyte stem cell reservoir at the top of the hair follicle can replenish the bulb , this keeps pigment production going			0
but when the reservoir of stem cells is exhausted , pigment production stops and the hair turns grey			0
contrary to popular belief , there is no evidence to link the onset of greying to stress , diet or lifestyle how can we prevent hair changing colour ? scientists have long known that in order to prevent hair from going grey they would need to either prolong the life of the melanocytes in the hair bulb – by protecting them from injury – or expand the melanocyte stem cell reservoir in the upper or top region of the hair follicle so they continue to replace lost pigment cells			1
a group of @entity266 scientists have identified a new series of agents that protect hair follicle melanocytes from damage at the end of the hair cycle			0
this enables pigment production to restart as soon as the next hair cycle begins			0
the agents work by mimicking the action of an enzyme called @entity279			0
this enzyme is the naturally occurring antioxidant in the hair bulb that protects melanocytes from oxidative damage			0
by duplicating the effects of @entity279 , melanocyte metabolism and survival improves			0
the new agents are being formulated into a product that can be applied as a spray - on serum or shampoo			0
but they wo n't re-colour grey hair or bring back the dead cells that produce hair colour			1
instead , they protect your melanocytes			0
so for those who can not find it within themselves to embrace the salt and pepper look , new options are on the horizon .			0

@entity8 is a professor of dermatology at @entity11
claims that by age 50 , half of us have lost colour in 50 per cent of our hair
premature greying may be a sign of anaemia a thyroid condition , he says
and scalp hair is usually lighter than pubic hair , which often has ' red ' tinge
