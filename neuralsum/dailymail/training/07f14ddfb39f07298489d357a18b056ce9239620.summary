my daughter and i went to the doctor the other day			1
she 's had mega-hayfever for the past few weeks and her medication just was n't working			1
' i think it 's time we tried something new , ' he said , reaching for his medicine book			1
' tell me , my dear , do you know how much you weigh ? ' i was just about to open my mouth when , quick as a flash , she told him herself , adding proudly , ' my best friend weighs much less , but i have big muscles , you see			1
' skinny queen : a slender @entity20 razor - sharp : @entity21 and her collarbone we left , armed with our prescription			1
but it 's stuck with me			1
i had no idea she knew how much she weighed - or , for that matter , that she knew how much her best friend weighed			1
it brought back anxious , ancient memories			1
i 'm not sure when , exactly , i became aware of my size and strength			2
but i remember a growing sense that there was a lot of me			2
too much , in fact			2
not so much fat , just big			2
big face , big head ( i 've always had trouble finding hats ) , big hands , wide shoulders , muscly legs , size 8 feet			2
as to weight , i have always been too heavy			1
i 've never managed to be my ' ideal ' weight ( 75 kilos , since you ask )			1
not even when i was 15 and a size 10			2
etiolated : super-slim @entity52 @entity54 and interesting : socialite @entity55 not even when i was starving myself to the point where my hair started falling out and my hands shook and i had ulcers inside my mouth			0
not even when i had to go and stay with my granny , who fed me chicken broth and told me i was beautiful and that it did n't matter that i was n't a long - limbed , doe - eyed ballerina and that she loved me anyway			0
realising that my daughter , who 's 11 , was entering a new phase in her life - one during which she would become conscious of the views of the world around her , a world in which she and her classmates might discuss such things - filled me with a sense of dread			1
entirely unfounded , i 'm sure : she 's a very different child to the one i was , so much more confident and articulate , and growing up in entirely other circumstances			1
nevertheless , i can not help but feel an anxious pang			1
young girls are not stupid			1
they look around and what they see is this : a world full of glossy , glamorous , beautiful people , with charmed lives and successful careers			0
they look at what unites those people and increasingly they see one thing : they are all super-skinny			0
take these pictures from the @entity95 in @entity96 on tuesday night , featuring some of the most talked about and celebrated young women of our age			0
to me they represent the ultimate triumph of our super-skinny culture			0
@entity52 , etiolated in top - to - toe black , posed along with @entity21 , her bony feet bird - like in pointy shoes , her shoulder blades and collar bone sharp as razors			1
they were joined by the queen of the super-skinnies , @entity20 , the only woman alive , with the possible exception of @entity113 , who can look svelte in a dress made out of old cushions			1
beautiful , effortless social x-rays			1
not that there 's anything intrinsically wrong with being slim			1
it 's laudable , in fact , especially in these days of junk food and sofa slobbing			1
it 's not being slim that 's wrong			1
it â€™s being super-skinny and being adored for it			0
thin friends : @entity128 worries that girls will associate the fame and fortune of the stars , from left , @entity134 , @entity20 and @entity52 , with the fact they are all super slim it 's the equating of skinny with virtue : beauty , goodness , style , femininity			1
the thinner these actresses , models , whatevers get , the more the fashion and showbiz worlds lionise them			0
they get all the best invitations , all the @entity148 passes			0
designers name handbags after them , magazines fawn over them			0
not because they are great scientists , doctors , lawyers , politicians			0
but because they go to parties in ever - tinier dresses			0
every time we see them the gospel of super-skinnyiness spreads , and not just through party pictures and glossy magazine shoots			0
many of these girls - such as model @entity55 , another of the @entity171 party skinnies - post endless selfies on @entity172 and @entity173 , silently rubbing our noses in their protruding hips , their tiny upper arms , their flat stomachs			1
" i like to joke that i am a failed anorexic ; but it 's not a joke really			1
too many girls do n't			1
" they make it all look so fabulous , so cool and glamorous - and so damn effortless			2
perhaps for these girls - and for all their genetically blessed friends - being that thin really just does come naturally			1
but what if being skinny just is n't in your genes ? what if , like me , you 're more of a @entity189 pit pony than an aristocratic gazelle ? and what if , like all young girls without exception , you are n't quite sure who or what you are but you do know that you want to fit in , to be cool , to be liked ? what then ? you stop eating			1
you obsess about every last morsel and calorie			0
and when you still ca n't feel your hipbones , you run the lovely , healthy body that @entity201 gave you into the ground , you starve it and torture it , you hollow it out from the inside until all that 's left is skin and bone			2
when i was young , the celebrity influence was n't even half as bad as it is now			0
back then we had @entity213 and @entity214 and other @entity216 role models and besides , i grew up in @entity217 , where hips and thighs are part of the culture			0
consequences : @entity128 hopes the diets she undertook as a youngster have n't caused her to have brittle bones and still i was infected			1
still i longed to be a seven stone weed , with bony ankles and sparrow - like wrists			0
being strong and clever did n't come into it			0
and so i set out to re-shape myself to that mould in the only way possible : dieting			0
what is it @entity232 said ? ' nothing tastes as good as skinny feels			2
' i loved this new absence of padding : it made me feel pious and strangely powerful , like i was in control			0
lighter physically , but emotionally too			0
at a time when my body was doing all kinds of strange things that were n't necessarily welcome ( periods , breasts , the whole messy , complicated transition from childhood to womanhood ) , i felt small again			0
and i had funny little @entity251 - ish tests i used to do to see how thin i was			2
i would lie in the bath on my stomach , and delight in the touch of my ribs against the enamel			0
i would stretch out on the bed and place a ruler between my hipbones , like a bridge			0
but at least the only person i was hurting was myself			0
three decades on i am 48			0
i wear a weave because i have weak , thin hair that frightens small children			2
i have the teeth of an 84 - year - old @entity266			0
i have an underactive thyroid , broken by years of bad dieting			0
who knows , i probably have osteoporosis ( i 'm too scared to check , but i did suffer a severe @entity272 wrist fracture a few years ago , also known as an ' old lady fracture ' )			0
i struggle to keep my weight stable not because i 'm a lazy layabout junk food junkie , but because my body clings to calories like a drowning man to a raft			2
this is what happens to normal girls who try to be like @entity52 and @entity20			1
i like to joke that i am a failed anorexic ; but it 's not a joke really			2
too many girls do n't			2
and as long as we live in a world that fetishises female thinness and treats it as the most desirable of all virtues , we are condemning successive generations of girls to a lifetime of self - loathing .			2

@entity128 's daughter already knows her weight and that she 's heavier than her best friend
our *columnist* worries about message being sent to them by skinny stars
anxious girls will equate fame and fortune with being thin
stars like @entity20 and @entity21 are ' effortless social x-rays '
@entity128 struggled with her own weight as a *teenager*
now worries how *drastic* diets have affected her health today
