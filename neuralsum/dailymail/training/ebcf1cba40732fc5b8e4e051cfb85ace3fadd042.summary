queues formed outside some shopping centres before opening yesterday and an estimated £ 1billion was spent on saturday alone			1
but experts warned retailers still faced an ‘ austerity @entity10 ’ with profits down on last year and a likely ‘ @entity13 bloodbath ’ in january , with up to 3,000 stores facing closure			1
many last minute customers were tempted in over the weekend by a raft of bargains @entity10 shoppers in @entity20 on saturday , which was the busiest shopping day of the year so far they suggested that because so many cut - price deals had been needed to lure customers , the heavy footfall would not necessarily translate into large profits			1
around 11million shoppers spent up to £ 1.5million a minute after much of the country left buying presents to the final full weekend before @entity10			1

those who have left their shopping late can expect bargains aplenty because retailers are working hard to shift excess stock			0
’ shops have been forced to introduce big reductions on products to get customers through the door a spokesman for the @entity88 said : ‘ this was a make - or - break weekend for many retailers who were hoping for a big turnout after a disappointing few months			1
‘ it does appear that large numbers went to the shops and that this was probably the busiest shopping weekend of the year , but it is too early to say whether this has translated into significant profits			2
‘ stores put on so many cut - price deals to attract consumers that profit margins will inevitably have been squeezed			2
