a furious @entity0 ( right ) calls out @entity6 after the pair had a coming together during the @entity20 2 at @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity23 @entity16 , in car 10 , span off track after being sent sideways by the incident with @entity6 seconds before she was not happy with her fellow driver , telling him straight ' you got on my left rear and spun me out ' @entity6 eventually clasped his head in his hands as @entity16 refused to accept his explanation for the spin but she was n't about to let @entity6 of the hook as , with cameras rolling , she marches over to @entity6 , grasps him by his race suit and makes her feelings clear in front of dozens of closely packed onlookers post race on thursday			1
the two had already been involved in an incident in practice the day before where @entity16 accused @entity6 of the very same thing			1
in yesterday 's confrontation over the dangerous high speed smash , she berated him furiously , saying : ' what are you doing , seriously ? you did the same thing in practice			1
' you get on my left rear and it spins me out			0
' do n't be up my a * * on my left corner again			0
' @entity6 replied : ' nobody has your back like i do but i ca n't give you an extra two feet because it 's you			0
' the heated argument continued , with @entity6 try to calm @entity16 , who stares him out intensely while he makes his case			1
he holds out his hands in a conciliatory gesture and grasps @entity16 round the shoulders at times , but there is no placating her and @entity6 finally seems exasperated and covers his face with his hands			2
@entity6 tried to tell @entity16 the problem was with her car 's aerodynamics but sh was having none of it the spin left @entity16 fighting to finish high enough to qualify for the 500 , but she still managed to do so @entity16 told @entity6 : ' you did the same thing , nobody else left me with a problem out there ' ' he cut across my rear bumper and pulls the back end around , ' @entity16 said			1
' i do n't want to have these issues , but if we 're going to have these issues then we 're going to have to deal with them			0
' we ca n't be putting ourselves out of our race at someone else 's expense and nothing 's happened to him			2
' @entity92 , her team co-owner , entered the fray and instructed @entity6 to watch the video			0
' what do you want me to do @entity98 , not race close ? ' replied @entity6 , adamant that @entity16 's car was too loose and he did n't make contact			1
he maintained the spin was caused by aerodynamics , not contact			0
' i try to treat everyone as equal , ' @entity6 said			0
' if you 're in this @entity105 series , you deserved your way here and you can handle a lot of situations			0
' i just got close to her and her car got loose again			0
i just tried to explain that , " @entity0 , oh , it 's you , i 've got to stay away two feet because your car is loose ? " ' i guess i just have to give more room because once i get close enough to her , her car just gets out of control			2
' after the crash @entity118 team worked frantically on rapid repairs and she restarted 18th with two laps to go			0
she was pushed all the way around @entity21 by teammate @entity124 to finish high enough to make the main event on sunday .			2
