horrified : @entity1 peer baroness @entity0 , pictured , tried to expose a ring of paedophiles @entity5 officers seized a paedophile dossier naming establishment figures drawn up by @entity1 peer @entity0 in the 1980s , it was claimed yesterday			1
officers citing ‘ national security ’ confiscated the file which listed 16 mps along with senior policemen , headteachers and clergy , it was said			1
the dossier was collated by the @entity18 of @entity19 who handed it to @entity22 , the editor of her local newspaper , the @entity23			1
mr @entity22 claimed a ‘ heavy mob ’ of @entity5 officers raided his office in 1984 and took away the file , threatening him with prison if he resisted			1
and he said that the day before the raid , @entity30 mp @entity29 – since exposed as a predatory paedophile – had also visited the office , demanding that he bury the story			2
it would be the second paedophile dossier to have ‘ disappeared ’			1
a year earlier , a file handed to former home secretary @entity38 by @entity40 mp @entity39 also went missing			2
this has now prompted prime minister @entity42 to set up a special inquiry into child abuse			0
@entity45 put together 30 pages of information about alleged attempts by the @entity49 ( @entity49 ) to infiltrate government while seeking funding and trying to persuade mps to legalise sex with children			2
as well as key members of both the @entity57 , she found that about 30 prominent businessmen , public school teachers , scoutmasters and police officers had links to @entity49			2
yesterday mr @entity22 , 61 , said : ‘ @entity0 was horrified at the rapid extent of @entity49 ’s involvement with key people and her file included details of about 16 household - name mps			1
’ he said @entity68 – who at the time was @entity70 mp @entity0 – passed him the dossier and asked if he would write a story based on it			1
‘ i agreed to run something the following week but obviously had to contact certain mps named – from the @entity1 , @entity30 and conservative parties – and the @entity76 for their responses , ’ said mr @entity22			2
‘ the next day , @entity29 came to my office			0
he must have heard about it , or been sent by , the former @entity30 leader @entity80			0
‘ @entity29 tried to persuade me that it was “ all poppycock ”			0
he said @entity0 had her “ knickers in a twist ” since leaving the @entity82 and had become bored with wine lakes and sugar mountains in @entity85			1
‘ he played down the whole episode and wanted an assurance that i would n’t run anything			0
‘ i could n’t give that and he went away very disappointed			0
the next day the heavy mob arrived			1
two or three police in uniform and half a dozen in plain clothes			0
bully : paedophile @entity29 is said to have asked an editor to bury the story ‘ they came at 8am , before most people had arrived for work , and showed me warrant cards and a d - notice and something signed by a judge			1
they threatened me with five to ten years in prison and took away my notebooks and all the papers @entity0 had given me			1
‘ it was a threat to national security , and not in the public interest , they told me			1
if i had said no , i would have been arrested			0
i had to give them assurances i had given them everything			0
they told me not to tell anyone , and the whole thing was over within half an hour			0
’ mr @entity22 went on to be a campaigning editor at the @entity122 newspaper known for his investigation that led to the freeing of @entity125 , wrongly jailed for the ‘ @entity127 ’ murder			2
but he said it was the incident with the @entity45 dossier that sparked his determination to expose cover - ups			2
he said : ‘ @entity0 had been a long - serving local mp and used to come and have a chat with me every couple of weeks			1
we had talked about a potential paedophile ring with mps before , but she said no one would listen			1
detective @entity138 has told how he was removed from a probe into a council - run children 's home in the late 1990s ‘ she asked me if i would take a look and run a story from her point of view			0
she objected to any funding of this organisation @entity49 , and was very concerned about the speed of their infiltration and the number of prominent names who were allegedly supporting them			0
‘ @entity0 was horrified , too , at the prospect of @entity156 approving legalised sex with children , often under the guise of educating them , and mentioned an influx of rent boys and unsavoury and unfortunate situations that had been covered up by the authorities			1
’ he said she had not been surprised when he told her about the visit from @entity5			2
‘ she sort of expected it , ’ he said			0
‘ this was a powerful organisation and she reluctantly admitted she was fighting a formidable foe			0
she apologised for the hassle it caused me			0
’ @entity68 died in 2002			0
mr @entity22 said of the dossier : ‘ it was 30 years ago , so i ca n’t remember the names and full details , but i was sworn to secrecy by @entity5 at the risk of jail if i repeated any of the allegations			1
