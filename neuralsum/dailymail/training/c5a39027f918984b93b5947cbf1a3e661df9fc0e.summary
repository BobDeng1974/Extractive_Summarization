by @entity0 published : 03:42 est , 29 january 2013 updated : 08:01 est , 29 january 2013 ' mastermind ' : @entity2 leaves the court in @entity4 , @entity5 , where he was today sentenced to six years in prison for drug possession @entity8 antique dealer @entity2 , said to be the mastermind behind a £ 1.6 million cocaine smuggling plot , was sentenced to six years imprisonment by a @entity5 court today			1
the sentence , at the end of a sensational series of trials that has seen a @entity8 grandmother given the death penalty , comes just days after @entity2 bragged he would not be sentenced to death			1
his punishment is regarded by police in @entity5 , where he was arrested last year , as a let - off – and has left 56 - year - old convicted @entity8 grandmother @entity2 the only member of a smuggling syndicate facing execution by firing squad			1
‘ we have always said @entity2 was a major player in this syndicate , ’ said a narcotics officer			1
‘ because the @entity33 woman was the one actually caught with the drugs does not take away the seriousness of others involved ’			0
@entity2 , a 43 - year - old former @entity36 antique dealer , who has been cleared of smuggling but was charged with drug possession , was the last of the so - called @entity8 ‘ gang of four ’ said to have plotted to bring 10.6lb of cocaine into the holiday island from @entity42			1
@entity2 was also fined one billion rupiah , around £ 65,000 , by the court in @entity5			1
two other @entity8 have received light sentences – @entity2 ’s lover @entity2 , 38 , has been sentenced to a year in jail for failing to report a drug crime , and 40 - year - old @entity2 from @entity47 , has been sent to prison for four years for possession of marijuana			1
mrs @entity2 , who is understood to have made no profit from the drug smuggling operation when she was arrested with the cocaine hidden in the lining of her suitcase last may , has accused @entity2 , @entity57 and @entity2 of being the major players			2
‘ i ’ve become the scapegoat in all this , ’ the @entity60 woman told narcotics squad officers as the investigation into the smuggling operation continued last year			0
‘ i can not be made to pay for the more serious crimes of others			0
’ through her co-operation in pointing an accusing finger at the others , prosecutors asked for a 15 - year - jail sentence and not mandatory death – but she was shocked when last week a panel of judges ignored the prosecution request and sentenced her to execution			2
the court accused @entity2 of damaging the image of the resort island			0
@entity2 and @entity57 lived in a £ 1,000 a week palatial villa in @entity5 and because of their aloof behaviour and extravagant lifestyle villagers described them as the @entity87 of @entity5			2
when mrs @entity2 led police to @entity2 after her arrest , he told officers that he thought packages she had given him were sweets for his six - year - old daughter , @entity93			2
scroll down to watch ' major player ' : @entity2 , seen in a holding cell before the hearing today , was sentenced to six years in prison jail time : @entity2 will spend six years behind bars for his part in the plot , in contrast to @entity2 who faces death by firing squad ' aloof ' : the extravagant lifestyle enjoyed by @entity2 and his partner @entity2 on the @entity108 isle saw them dubbed the ' @entity87 of @entity5 ' by locals mrs @entity2 plans to launch an appeal against the death sentence , a process that is expected to take years as it drags through the courts , and she has also started action against the @entity116 claiming it has failed to support her appeal			1
she is understood to have exhausted all her family ’s finances and can not afford a lawyer to fight the appeal , documents for which must be filed by february 12			0
if she misses the deadline , the human rights charity @entity125 said she could still appeal for presidential clemency			0
plot : the @entity8 former antique dealer 's punishment has been met with disappointment from police in @entity5 , who regard the six year sentence as a ' let - off ' ' @entity135 ' : @entity2 , seen right with his translator in court in @entity5 , had bragged that he would not receive a death sentence in the days leading up to the verdict verdict : former antiques dealer @entity2 leaves the temporary cell to make his way to the hearing at @entity4 district court in @entity5 today the charity has engaged solicitors in @entity8 to file a judicial review on mrs @entity2 ’s behalf against the @entity116			1
@entity125 alleges the @entity116 has failed to take all reasonable steps to ensure that mrs @entity2 does not face the death penalty and does not suffer degrading treatment			0
the charity also alleges that the @entity116 is in breach of its obligations to have ensured that mrs @entity2 received a fair trial			0
@entity2 , cleared of smuggling but convicted of possessing 23g of cocaine , faced a maximum sentence of life in prison			2
but the prosecution asked the judges to impose a penalty of seven years - and then , in a reversal of the way the judges treated mrs @entity2 , they reduced his sentence to six years			2
so he , like his partner @entity57 and @entity2 , has got off lightly when at first all of them , including mrs @entity2 , were facing the death penalty			0
end of the road : @entity2 has been sentenced to death by firing squad ' scapegoat ' : mrs @entity2 , from @entity60 , plans to launch an appeal against her death sentence ' extravagant ' : @entity2 's lover @entity2 , 39 , has been sentenced to a year in prison for failing to report a drug crime with time served and because of her good behaviour behind bars , miss @entity2 hopes to be back home in @entity8 before the summer			1
@entity2 can also expect to have up to a year taken off his six year sentence			0
@entity2 is likely to be released shortly after he has served three years of his sentence for marijuana possession			0
that would leave only mrs @entity2 behind bars , facing a bleak future of years of appeals and , even then , the grim prospect of being taken to waste ground and gunned down by a firing squad			1
in her case , the prosecution had asked for her to be sent to jail for 15 years , but she , the police and lawyers were shocked when the judges handed down the death penalty .			0
