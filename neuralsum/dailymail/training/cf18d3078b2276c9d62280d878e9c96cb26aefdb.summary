while @entity1 has grabbed headlines aplenty with his goals and robust style since joining @entity5 , it 's another summer acquisition from @entity6 who has helped @entity9 's side really tick so far this season			2
not only did @entity12 ' £ 30million move from @entity14 leave @entity16 fans in uproar , it also made a significant section of the @entity20 faithful question their manager			0
the @entity23 's talent was never an issue , but how could they welcome a player with such strong connections to their @entity29 rivals into @entity9 's tight - knit camp ? @entity5 midfielder @entity12 has already recorded 13 assists in the @entity32 this season @entity12 celebrates scoring a goal of his own in @entity5 's 2 - 0 win at @entity36 just before @entity37 @entity12 ( @entity5 ) - 13 @entity38 ( @entity39 ) - 8 @entity40 ( @entity41 ) - 7 @entity42 ( @entity43 ) - 7 @entity44 ( @entity45 ) - 6 @entity46 ( @entity47 ) - 6 @entity48 ( @entity16 ) - 6 @entity49 ( @entity50 ) - 6 fast forward five months and any doubts about @entity12 - or his commitment - have been well and truly banished after the @entity54 ' brilliant first half of the campaign			1
@entity5 are three points clear at the top of the @entity32 and have scored the joint highest amount of goals - two things @entity61 can take a huge amount of credit for			2
after picking a pass to @entity66 for the @entity67 to equalise against @entity43 on sunday , the 27 - year - old now has 13 assists in the top - flight this season			2
not only is that the highest amount in the division , it 's also five more than second - placed @entity38 of @entity39			0
@entity39 midfielder @entity38 ( right ) is @entity12 ' closer challenger when it comes to assists former @entity14 midfielder @entity12 has also created more chances than any other player this season @entity12 - 61 @entity44 - 54 @entity48 - 51 @entity42 - 50 @entity66 - 47 @entity79 - 45 @entity80 - 44 @entity38 - 42 @entity81 - 42 @entity49 - 41 @entity41 's @entity40 and @entity43 's @entity42 share third place with seven assists to their names , but both are a long way behind the @entity6 midfielder			1
it would be easy to assume that @entity12 has more assists because he is setting up the likes of £ 32m man @entity1 , however the numbers prove otherwise			0
@entity12 has created 61 chances ( including assists ) this season - seven more than second - placed @entity44 and 10 more than @entity16 forward @entity48			1
he is making an average of 3.33 scoring opportunities per 90 minutes since moving to @entity20 , showing a staggering consistency to his game across the opening 19 fixtures			0
@entity102 captain @entity101 managed a league high of 13 assists during the 2013 - 14 campaign but @entity12 has already equalled that tally and we 're only halfway through the season			1
one more and he 'll jump into a tie for sixth on the all - time list of @entity32 assist - makers alongside the likes of @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114			0
@entity45 winger @entity44 has created 54 chances this season - seven less than @entity12 @entity101 registered 13 assists last season but @entity12 has equalled that after just 19 games but @entity61 wo n't be content with that			1
@entity121 's record of 20 assists - set for @entity16 during the 2002 - 03 season - is well within his reach			1
the @entity125 's total has stood untouched for over a decade but his former team - mate has the skill , experience and vision to smash it to pieces			0
in fact , if @entity12 goes on to create goals at the same rate until may , he will end up with 26 assists for the season			0
@entity1 can expect more goals and attention if his team - mate continues his current form , but it 'll be @entity61 who goes down as @entity9 's most influential signing of last summer			0
@entity16 legend @entity121 holds the record for assists in one @entity32 season with 20			1

@entity5 star @entity12 has 13 @entity32 assists this season
the midfielder has also created more chances than any other player
@entity12 has already equalled @entity101 's assist total from 2013 - 14
the @entity156 man needs eight more to break @entity121 's record
