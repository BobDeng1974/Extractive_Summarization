by @entity0 published : 07:22 est , 22 october 2012 updated : 12:42 est , 22 october 2012 these are the prototypes of robots that may one day live among - even as our friends			1
developed in @entity6 and @entity7 , they are being designed to rescue us , clear our sewers and become our companions			1
scientists even hope some of the humanoid designs will one day compete - and beat - humans in football matches			1
in the palm of his hand : the @entity18 robot , modelled on a three - year - old child , is among a new generation of humanoids which are being designed in @entity6 and @entity7 to performed complex tasks like humans @entity24 of their eye : ambitious scientists hope one day their robots will rescue us , become our friends and clear our sewers some can walk , talk and dance , speak 20 languages , hold conversations and respond with life - like expressions			1
the @entity36 humanoid can interact with humans using an expressive face and artificial hands			0
theoretically , it could be controlled from anywhere in the world and so could be the forerunner of a robotic surgeon performing remote operations around the globe			1
others have been inspired by nature and can swim like fish or mimic the flight of birds and insects			0
mimicking nature : robots like @entity55 ( above ) are covered in a synthetic skin to give a life - like appearance and can respond to humans with facial expressions much like our own blending in : like @entity55 ( left ) , eve ( right ) is given a life - like face and hair to make them as authentic as possible the @entity64 , which has the ' natural speed and motion of a large carp ' , can operate autonomously and is designed to monitor water pollution and detect leaks from ships in harbour			1
dr @entity72 , senior researcher at the @entity73 , said the scientists had looked to nature for inspiration			0
' natural systems demonstrate perfectly that most of the difficult engineering problems have already been solved , ' he said			2
' by drawing inspiration from these living proofs we can achieve difficult tasks that would otherwise have been impossible			0
' treading the boards : the @entity84 , made by @entity85 of @entity86 , is a ' humanoid acting robot ' which can be programmed to move like a human actor @entity89 : @entity90 , a programmable humanoid robot built by @entity92 company @entity90 ( left ) , and @entity36 ( right ) , which could eventually carry out surgical operations while being controlled anywhere in the world going swimmingly : the @entity64 ( above ) can operate autonomously and is designed to monitor water pollution and detect leaks from ships in harbour spy in the sky : unmanned aerial vehicle developed by engineers at @entity103 which could be used for reconnaissance or security flight of the future : another design of unmanned aerial vehicle developed by engineers at @entity103 life - savers : robots like @entity112 ( above ) have sensitive ' whiskers ' which could be used to search pitch - black caves for rescue missions clever : @entity117 is another touch - sensitive robot which could open a whole range of possibilities for its use industrial cleaning : the @entity124 , a self - sustainable robot which can power itself by feeding off sewage water i wan na be like you : a humanoid robot , featured with simple sensors and servomotors experts remain divided about whether true artificial intelligence can be obtained			1
but scientists are certainly making good progress			0
a series of tests has been suggested to determine whether the computer can equal the human mind and two have been successful : defeat the @entity141 ( achieved ) beat the world champions at tv general knowledge quiz show jeopardy ( achieved ) successfully impersonate a human in online communications assimilate visual information as effectively as the human brain one of his personal creations is the @entity124 , which can power itself by ' feeding ' on sewage water			1
the water provides nutrients for the robot ’s fuel cells and these generate electricity to power it			0
this self - sustainability means it could eventually be programmed to roam along sewers , cleaning them as it goes			2
dr @entity72 added : ' by looking at how animals in nature sustain themselves , a robot could be developed that is able to operate in hostile and lethal environments , providing a service to humankind			2
' others like the @entity168 and @entity117 , which both have sensitive ' whiskers ’ , could be used in rescue missions to search pitch - black caves			1
the @entity18 - a ' robot youngster ' modelled on a three - and - a - half year old child - is designed to give insight into how real humans develop and learn from their environment			2
the @entity84 , made by @entity85 of @entity86 , is a ' humanoid acting robot ’ which can be programmed to move like a human actor			0
all around us : the scientists involved looked to nature for inspiration , where they say many engineering problems have already been solved @entity185 sparks : engineers working at the @entity189 , where many of these designs are being brought to reality it uses facial - recognition software to mimic human movement and respond to faces			2
one version speaks 20 different languages			1
unmanned aerial vehicles mimic the flight and hovering capabilities of birds and insects			0
they are already used by the military but could also enter civilian life as scouts for search and rescue missions			0
@entity90 is a robot that can walk , talk , dance and respond to human speech			0
they have spent time in paediatric wards , where it gives advice and support to young patients with chronic illnesses like diabetes			0
@entity55 and @entity219 are humanoid heads , which are able to talk and respond to people with human - like facial expressions			1
they are covered in a synthetic skin for a lifelike appearance .			0

new generation of humanoids being developed in @entity6 and @entity7 labs
some can dance , speak 20 languages and react with life - like expressions
one could be controlled to carry out operations anywhere in the world
others could *locate* people *trapped* in caves or clean our sewage systems
