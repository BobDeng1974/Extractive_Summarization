one in eight of those polled said they had been asked to contribute towards a bigger present for a child , and of these , the majority ( 53 per cent ) thought the request had been cheeky and that the child should be happy with what they received			1
only a quarter of those questioned ( 28 per cent ) said they were happy to contribute to a group present if it meant the youngster got what they wanted			0
in terms of cost , more than a third were asked to contribute less than £ 10 , while a further 42 per cent could choose how much to give			2

but she maintained she was trying to convey a serious message and it was her intention to remind parents , who are under pressure to do the best for their children , of what birthdays should be about			2
the findings from the new research into birthday presents show that @entity0 's school was towards the top end of the scale when it came to financial contributions			1
around two - thirds of parents spend between £ 5 - £ 10 on a gift to take to a child ’s party , with a similar proportion saying they think this is the appropriate amount			2
