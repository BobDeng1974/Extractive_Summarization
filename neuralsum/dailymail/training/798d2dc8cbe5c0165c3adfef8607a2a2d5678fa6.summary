by @entity0 if you want to leave your mark on space , then here is your chance			0
@entity6 is inviting people to have their names etched into a microchip aboard a spacecraft heading to asteroid @entity11 in 2016			1
the ‘ messages to @entity11 ! ’ microchip will travel to the asteroid aboard the agency 's @entity15 ( @entity15 ) spacecraft			1
@entity6 is inviting people to have their names etched into a microchip aboard a spacecraft heading to asteroid @entity11 in 2016			1
this is an artist 's representation of what the mission could look like the robotic mission will spend more than two years at the 1,760 ft ( 500 metre ) - wide asteroid			1
the spacecraft will collect a sample of @entity11 's surface and return it to @entity30 in a sample return capsule			1
one microchip will be brought back to @entity30			0
another copy will remain in outer space long after the sample has landed			0
those wishing to participate in ‘ messages to @entity11 ! ’ can submit their names here by september 30			0
@entity15 will spend more than two years at the 1,760 ft ( 500 metre ) - wide asteroid , named @entity11			1
it plans to return an asteroid sample to @entity30 to reveal the origins of volatiles and organics that may be the seeds of life the @entity15 ( origins , @entity48 , @entity49 ) mission aims to address basic questions about the composition of the very early solar system			1
the probe will spend more than two years at the 1,760 ft ( 500 metre ) - wide asteroid , named @entity11			2
it plans to return an asteroid sample to @entity30 to reveal the origins of volatiles and organics that may be the seeds of life			2
scientists also hope the mission will accelerate technology that will soon enable humans to mine asteroids for precious metals			0
the spacecraft , scheduled for launch in september 2016 , will arrive at the asteroid @entity11 in october 2018			2
it will travel 406,618,624 miles ( 654,389,243 km ) to reach the asteroid			0
after a person submits their name , they will be able to download and print a certificate documenting their participation in the @entity15 mission			2
the @entity15 mission goal is to address basic questions about the composition of the very early solar system , the source of organic materials and water that made life possible on @entity30			1
it also hopes to better predict the orbits of asteroids that represent collision threats to the @entity30			0
it will collect a minimum of two ounces ( 60g ) of surface material			0
scientists claim the mission will accelerate technology that will soon enable humans to mine asteroids for precious metals			0
@entity6 scientists believe the high concentration of raw materials found in asteroids - such as ingredients for fuel and precious metals like iron and platinum - could supply @entity30 with vital stockpiles of natural resources			0
once the sample return capsule deploys , the spacecraft will be placed into a long - term solar orbit around the sun , along with the microchip and every name on it			1
‘ it is exciting to consider the possibility that some of the people who register to send their names to @entity11 could one day be a part of the team that analyses the samples from the asteroid 10 years from now , ’ said @entity113 , mission project scientist at @entity6 .			2

@entity123 will travel aboard the agency 's @entity15 spacecraft in 2016
the mission will spend over two years gathering samples on the asteroid
it plans to address questions about composition of the early solar system
once the sample return capsule deploys , the spacecraft will be placed into a long - term solar orbit , along with the microchip and every name on it
