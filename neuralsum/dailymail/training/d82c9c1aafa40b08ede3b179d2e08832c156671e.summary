that ’s what @entity3 claim their latest creation , the @entity6 , has in spades			2
and thankfully , within seconds of putting them in your ears , it ’s clear that they ’re every bit as monstrous as expected			0
raw power : there are few earphones of similar price that deliver such smooth low - end thump the @entity6 take some of the best elements from the existing @entity3 headphones and wraps them in a £ 99 package			1
the result is a pair of earphones packed with the latest soundproofing technology , world - class audio components and exquisite build quality			1
@entity30 , crisp sound is achieved through their 13.5mm dynamic drivers , while a metal voice coil enriches the sound			1
the oversized 5mm angled nozzle injects the music straight into the sweet spot , too			0
there ’s a strong depth of sound , perhaps slightly weaker than the more expensive @entity41 , but instrument distinction is wonderful			1
there ’s enough bass available through most amplitudes , but is at its best through the mid-range			1
vocals cut through the low - end thump brilliantly , although at higher volumes become slightly overpowered			2
@entity51 , though , is kept at a minimum , and coupled with excellent noise insulation , ensures a wonderfully immersive experience			2
as much time has been spent on the @entity6 ’s aesthetics , too			0
the enlarged acoustic chambers are a result of injection - moulded steel – further enhancing sound quality , while reinforcing their aggressive character			1
there ’s more than a hint of @entity41 about their design – albeit slightly less flashy , but the overarching sense of clinical efficiency is impossible to ignore in the @entity6 ’s crisp , sharp curves			0
the cable is manufactured from high - performance @entity69 with a low - friction @entity71 coating to stop tangling			1
while a stainless steel remote allows you to answer phone calls with a touch of a button			0
to ensure a snug fit , with @entity79 eartips in three sizes – small , medium and large			0
@entity83 , the @entity6 earphones punch well above their weight			0
follow @entity0 on @entity85 : @ @entity86 and on @entity87 : @entity88 .			0
