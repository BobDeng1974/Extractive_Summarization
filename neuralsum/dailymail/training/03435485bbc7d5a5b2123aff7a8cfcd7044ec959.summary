@entity7 , from @entity38 in the @entity39 , scours local parks to find the insects but will travel over 600 miles to his parent 's house in @entity44 to capture more unusual bugs			1
his favourite subjects are jumping spiders and he is even considering a trip to @entity49 to find the @entity51 spider , due to their colourful abdomens			1
one such jumping spider capture by @entity7 is the @entity55 spider			1
it is found in @entity57 and females grow the largest , reaching around one centimetre in body length			0
females also have the most pronounced ' moustache ' , found below the eyes , and in fact the name of the species means @entity66			0
the red back salamander , pictured , is a small terrestrial salamander usually found in forested areas under rocks and logs across eastern @entity57 , west to @entity72 , south to @entity38 , and north from southern @entity73 and the @entity74 in @entity75 to @entity76			1
they are also known as the eastern red backed salamander or the northern red back salamander depending on where they are found			0
adults grow between 5.7 and 10 cm in length the larvae of a @entity85			0
this larvae becomes a common swallowtail butterfly found in @entity57 , also known as the @entity89 butterfly			0
the wingspan of a @entity85 ranges from nine to 10cm @entity7 , who has just finished a degree in environmental science , said : ' i originally planned to focus on reptiles and amphibians but i soon realised how many insects are out there			1
' i try to capture the insects out in the field but sometimes i bring them home so i can photograph them there with lighting			1
' taking the photograph itself does n't take too long but it can be difficult when they are moving around as it becomes very sensitive when you are zoomed in so much			1
' sometimes i can spend a couple of hours trying to get the perfect shot and it can be quite difficult			1
' the small varieties of the jumping spider are very active so often i look through the lens and i have to find it as it moves around			2
' after working with them for so long i now know what to expect and how to handle them			0
' i try to photography any insect i can and i often travel to @entity44 to see my parents but take my camera and focus on the insects they have over there			1
' i went on a trip to @entity128 and took my camera and one day i would love to travel to @entity49 and take a photograph of the @entity51 jumping spider they have there			1

there are said to be around 22,000 known species of chalcids and each eat the eggs or larvae of other insects as food			2
as a result , the wasps keep crop pests under control and many species have been imported into regions for this reason there are said to be around 22,000 known species of @entity136 and each eat the egg or larvae of other insects for food			1
