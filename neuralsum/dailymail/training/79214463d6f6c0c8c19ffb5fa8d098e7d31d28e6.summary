by @entity0 follow @ @ laura_mail @entity1 has a stark message for those who still think he has just ‘ waltzed ’ back into @entity6 ’s @entity5 gymnastics team after retiring and then winning the @entity8 ’s @entity7			1
‘ louis is back , ’ he says , leaning forward , intensity in his eyes			2
‘ not the public kind of fame @entity11 , but the louis who has trained for 21 years and got three @entity16 medals			0
he ’s back to kick some ass			0
’ in a candid interview , @entity1 has revealed his battle with depression in trying to cope with the glare of publicity after @entity23 and how hard it has been to regain his gymnastics status after losing sponsorship and @entity27 funding			1
@entity1 won @entity29 ¿ s first individual @entity16 medal for 100 years in @entity30 the sequins of saturday night tv have been stripped away and @entity1 , the gymnast who won @entity29 ’s first individual @entity16 medal for 100 years in taking bronze at the @entity35 in 2008 , is back on the pommel horse			1
he retired after winning silver — having earned the same overall score as gold medallist @entity39 of @entity40 — and team bronze at @entity23 , but started training again last december , shedding a stone in weight in the first three weeks before getting back on his favourite apparatus in mid-january			1
at 25 , however , @entity1 is no longer a ‘ young pup ’ in what is a young man ’s sport			1
he insists it ‘ was not hard ’ to get back into shape after he piled on weight going on lads ’ holidays , ‘ buying a bottle of champagne in 10 seconds and drinking it and just enjoying life ’ after the @entity23			1
but the rough , calloused surface of @entity1 ’s palms reveal how much effort he has put in over the past seven months : they feel like sandpaper when you shake his hand			1
@entity1 won @entity64 with dance partner @entity65 in 2012 ‘ there were loads of articles about “ louis being overweight ” and “ he ’s looking fat ” and all the rest of it , ’ he says , ‘ but it did n’t bother me too much because i knew if i really wanted to i could drop the weight that quick			1
‘ @entity75 definitely sapped me , emotionally and physically , so that ’s why i needed the break after 2012 to end up falling back in love with gymnastics and really understand why i enjoy it			1
’ @entity1 admits he is ‘ exhausted ’ , but talks about the tough , challenging environment of the gym as if it is a safe haven ; a reassuring constant he has known throughout his life			1
yet when he first exploded into the public consciousness after the @entity35 , aged only 19 , that world suddenly changed , and he struggled to cope			0
@entity1 opens up about the ‘ dark times ’ of depression that afflicted him after winning a medal			1
he describes his feelings at the time in the manner of someone else looking in , as if he still can not marry the teenage louis with the recognised star who had children queuing for autographs outside his mother @entity97 ’s house in @entity99			0
he said : ‘ i went from being an 18 - year - old kid who could go out , get drunk , eat a kebab with his mates , go to a party and try and snog some girl — just a normal lad — and suddenly i went to the @entity16 , got a medal , came home and your life has completely changed , exploded			1
‘ i had responsibilities all of a sudden , i was a role model and i was freaking out			0
i did n’t know what to do			0
i got really depressed with it			0
it got to the point where i was going to the gym , i ’d do my work , come back and i would n’t talk to anyone			0
@entity1 won an individual silver medal and a team bronze at @entity23 ‘ it was a real shock and it was hard — very , very hard and very emotional			1
you ’re used to that old life and you kind of cling on to it			0
but you ca n’t have it			0
‘ that ’s the bit that starts breaking you down : trying to hold on to what you had before because this new life is a bit alien and you ’re not sure where to step			0
it was a really dark time			0
’ six years on , @entity1 now speaks with the manner of a man much more comfortable in his own skin , able to joke about being called ‘ an @entity16 dancer ’ , yet clear in his own mind about his priorities			2
life before @entity23 was a hectic merry - go - round of commercial appearances and training , but now all but one of his sponsors have gone and he no longer receives @entity27 funding			1
he is doing this himself , and the hard way , having helped to inspire a renaissance in @entity146 gymnastics that has seen more homegrown athletes become genuine contenders on the global stage			2
@entity1 was not picked for this year ’s @entity150 and , although he is targeting next year ’s @entity151 and the @entity152 in @entity153 , he knows selection for @entity6 at the @entity155 is no guarantee of regaining a @entity146 vest			1
@entity1 is also fiercely conscious there are those , from within the sport and the wider public , who still see his comeback as a publicity stunt			2
@entity1 wowed the judges with his performances in @entity7 ' i ’m coming back into the sport , kind of alien , ’ he says			1
‘ i have n’t been training from 2012 , like the rest of the guys have			2
i ’ve been seen as someone who has taken a break , gone off and done @entity7 and shows and enjoyed the limelight			2
‘ i think some people might have thought me coming back was a publicity stunt and i was n’t serious about it			0
i think they felt like i was undermining all the other gymnasts who were training hard			0
they thought , “ how can he waltz in here and expect to take the place of someone who ’s been training hard since 2012 ? ” ‘ i had to say a few things to raise a few eyebrows and say , “ you know , i ’m not messing around and you need to take me seriously ”			2
‘ if i did well at the @entity5 it would be bittersweet to certain people who perhaps do n’t want to see me in the team , but there would be a lot of satisfaction for me , too			2
’ he suddenly smiles , unable to resist			0
‘ and i could do a salsa on the podium			0
