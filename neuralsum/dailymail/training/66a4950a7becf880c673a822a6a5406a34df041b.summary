by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 03:57 est , 15 january 2013 updated : 12:10 est , 17 january 2013 uncertainty about @entity5 ’s place in @entity6 will have a ‘ chilling effect ’ on jobs and growth , @entity2 warned today			0
with @entity10 due to give a landmark speech on the @entity12 on friday , which is set to trigger a five - year countdown to a referendum , mr @entity2 cautioned against ‘ jeopardising ’ the @entity5 ’s prime role in @entity16			1
the deputy pm warned it was not ‘ wise ’ to place in peril employment in @entity5 by embarking on an ‘ an arcane debate that will go on for years and years and years ’			1
mr @entity10 is under intense pressure from within his own party to use the threat of potential exit from the @entity12 to drive a hard bargain with @entity16 to repatriate powers back to @entity35			1
he has rushed his long - awaited speech forward to this friday to appease the @entity37 who were unhappy at plans to hold it next tuesday , the 50th anniversary of the @entity42 , which saw @entity43 and @entity37 finally bury the hatchet after decades of conflict and hostility			1
yesterday the prime minister gave the strongest hint yet that he will promise a referendum on @entity5 ’s relationship with the @entity12 after the next election – after trying to renegotiate a ‘ fresh settlement ’			1
but today mr @entity2 insisted the coalition had already legislated to offer a referendum if the @entity12 tried to transfer more powers to @entity16 , but more uncertainty was dangerous			2
mr @entity2 warned against holding ' a referendum out of thin blue air ' ‘ we 've given that clarity , we 've provided that certainty that there will be a referendum triggered in the future in those circumstances			0
the priority remains jobs and growth not an arcane debate that will go on for years and years and years , ’ he told @entity71 ’s today programme			1
' all i 'm saying is we should be very careful at a time when the @entity5 economy is still haltingly recovering from the worst economic shock in a generation to create a very high degree and prolonged period of uncertainty			0
' in my view , uncertainty is the enemy of growth and jobs because our priority in this government and our priority in the national duty has got to be to foster growth and jobs			0
' if you are an investor investing in jobs in the @entity5 , to create jobs here ... i think it is unnecessary to create a high degree of uncertainty that might actually chase away investment and might diminish the number of jobs in this country			0
' mr @entity2 said he would focus on @entity5 ’s leadership role in the @entity12 and the need to protect jobs			2
‘ i think that we should be proud of the leadership that we have exercised in the @entity12			2
‘ the single market would n't have have happened without the @entity107			0
‘ i do n't think we should do anything to jeopardise our leadership and we certainty should n't do anything that would have a chilling effect on jobs in this country			0
’ mr @entity2 's remarks will be seen as a direct challenge to mr @entity10 , who yesterday accused critics who warn against re-opening the @entity6 debate of wanting to ' stick your head in the sand '			1
the @entity122 leader also challenged mr @entity10 's idea of renegotiating @entity5 's membership of the @entity12 , adding : ' i do n’t agree with the premise that we can , on our own if you like , unilaterally simply rewrite the terms of our membership for this @entity6 club , which is a club which is in need of reform			1
' @entity10 accused people who warn against engaging in the @entity6 debate of ' burying their heads in the sand ' by shifting his speech from january 22 mr @entity10 hopes to avoid offending @entity37 and @entity43 sensibilities as they celebrate the 50th anniversary of the @entity42			1
but , in a sign of the diplomatic difficulties involved , the new date , january 18 , also coincides with a number of other ominous anniversaries : however @entity146 insisted it was right for mr @entity10 to take a lead in the @entity6 debate			1
' the central point here is that the debate around the future of the @entity12 is already under way , ' the prime minister 's official spokesman said			1
' the prime minister 's view is that it is absolutely in the national interest to take the lead in this debate that is already under way			1
' mr @entity10 is due to meet conservative @entity164 members tomorrow to brief them on the details of his speech			2
he spoke by telephone with @entity170 prime minister @entity169 last night to discuss his approach to the issue			1
the @entity158 yesterday attacked the ' bossiness ' of @entity16 and insisted he was ‘ not happy ’ with every aspect of the @entity5 ’s relationship with the rest of @entity6			0
he added : ' those that say " this is very dangerous , you ’re putting at risk the relationship with @entity6 , you ’re putting at risk our position with regard to business " , i do n’t agree with that			0
' the fact is this debate is happening anyway			0
so we have a choice as politicians : do you get out there , lead that debate , make the changes that would be right for @entity5 – and i would argue right for @entity6 – and then give people a choice about that ? ' or do you kind of stick your head in the sand and just hope the debate is going to go away ? ' dubbed ' @entity206 ' , mr @entity10 's address on @entity5 's relationship with @entity6 has been promised for months			1
the waiting began when he used a newspaper article in june 2012 to say : ' for me the two words “ @entity6 ” and “ referendum ” can go together			0
' in december he defended the delays , claiming the development of his vision for the @entity12 was like tantric sex and would be worth the wait			2
speaking to journalists in @entity218 , mr @entity10 said : ' thank you for reminding me that my @entity6 speech is as yet unmade			2
' this is a tantric approach to policy - making			0
it will be even better when it does eventually come ... that was n't in the script the sense of chaos in @entity146 continued yesterday , when the decision to give the speech on friday was rushed out			2
@entity231 denounced the handling of the issue as a ' shambles '			0
shadow foreign secretary @entity235 said : " when it comes to @entity10 's speech on @entity6 , he ca n't seem to decide on a date , let alone a policy			2
it 's not so much a @entity146 strategy as a @entity146 shambles			0
' it seems that @entity10 has now been forced to bring forward his speech for the same reason that it was originally delayed - the opposition he faces from within his own party , as well as from @entity5 's allies and @entity5 business has simply overwhelmed him			1
' as the chaos continues , this is a prime minister who looks unable to control the agenda or his party on @entity6			1
' a spokesman for mr @entity10 said @entity258 pm @entity257 will not attend the speech , despite earlier reports that he had been signed up as an ally in the battle with @entity16			2
the speech will be delivered to @entity6 diplomats , business leaders and ' other interested parties '			0
mr @entity10 is determined to set out @entity268 policy for @entity6 , despite the criticism of his mr @entity2 mr @entity10 will meet mr @entity257 for talks during his visit to @entity272			1
he briefed the @entity258 pm and @entity37 chancellor @entity274 over the weekend on what he was planning to say , and is expected to speak to more @entity12 leaders over the coming days			1
mr @entity10 's official spokesman declined to say whether the @entity158 thought mr @entity257 would back his stance , saying : ' it is for the @entity258 government to set out their views			0
' the spokesman said it was ' entirely appropriate ' to make the speech in the @entity258 , as it had a similar " global - trading , outward - looking history " to the @entity5			0
@entity288 vice-president @entity287 has warned that it would be a " disaster " for the @entity5 if it withdrew from the @entity12			0
he told the @entity71 's @entity294 programme that renegotiating the @entity5 's terms of membership would be ' extremely difficult ' , adding : ' if you want to be in a club and you want to be an important member of the club - as i think the @entity5 should be - you can not be influential and relevant saying , ' i do n't want this , i do n't want that '			0

@entity122 leader says ' arcane debate ' will last for years and years and puts growth in peril
@entity10 said opponents want to ' stick their heads in the sand '
prime minister will deliver long - awaited @entity12 speech in @entity272 on friday
@entity206 rushed forward to avoid *upsetting* the @entity37
