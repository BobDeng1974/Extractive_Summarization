students who texted the most displayed evidence of racism @entity4 texters more likely to have shallow and rapid thoughts author of the study believes the effect of constant texting and tweeting needs further investigation by @entity12 published : 22:54 est , 12 april 2013 updated : 00:45 est , 13 april 2013 teenagers who text more than 100 times a day tend to be shallow , image - obsessed and driven by wealth - not to mention pretty bad at spelling			1
the study from the @entity19 suggests that a lot can be learned about a person ’s personality simply from the number of texts they send			2
the most incessant texters often turn out to be a slightly more racist than others			2
the theory the university study tried to test was that constant use of twitter and texting for communication results in a world where people have quick and shallow thoughts			1
people with superficial opinions with little substance beneath			0
the results indicate that students who text frequently place less importance on moral , aesthetic and spiritual goals and greater importance on wealth and image			0
long term : the study conducted over a period of three years amongst 2,300 students at the @entity19 superficial thinking : texting and using @entity63 for extreme periods of time can change your thought process strikingly , the study states those who text more than 100 times a day were 30 per cent less likely to feel strongly that leading an ethical , principled life was important , in comparison to those who texted 50 times or less a day			1
the students texted , some spoke on cellphones , and some did neither			1
the students rated their feelings towards different social groups			0
those who had been texting the most , rated ethnic - minority groups more negatively			0
in the most extreme cases , 30 per cent of the survey - takers texted more than 200 times a day and that 12 per cent texted at least 300 times a day			0
priorities : heavy teen texters place less importance on moral , aesthetic , and spiritual goals , and greater importance on wealth and image the study was inspired by the ' shallowing hypothesis ' first described by @entity94 in his 2010 book @entity96 : what the @entity97 is doing to our brains			2
it does not suggest that shallow mindedness is at all new , merely the growth of texting and twitter has resulted in new avenues for expression that has made such thoughts more acceptable			1
the theory states ' ultra brief social media like texting and @entity63 encourages rapid , relatively shallow thought and consequently very frequent daily use of such media should be associated with cognitive and moral shallowness			1
' ' the values and traits most closely associated with texting frequency are surprisingly consistent with @entity94 ’s conjecture that new information and social media technologies may be displacing and discouraging reflective thought , ' dr. @entity114 , associate professor of psychology at the @entity19 , said in a statement			0
' we still do n’t know the exact cause of these modest but consistent associations , but we think they warrant further study			0
