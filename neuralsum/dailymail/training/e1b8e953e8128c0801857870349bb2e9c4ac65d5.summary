by @entity0 with the average woman 's make - up bag now totting up to a staggering £ 220 , one cosmetic company has set about helping women achieve the flawless look for a fraction of the price			1
@entity8 is a 300 piece collection of make - up priced between £ 1 - £ 12 that promises to match high - end products on variety and quality			1
the range , which has just launched at @entity16 and consists of shadow palettes , lip glosses , nail varnishes and eye foils , claims to contain formulas , ingredients and durability equal to the prestige brands			1
cheap vs expensive : @entity26 , pictured , left , wearing expensive products and , right , wearing @entity29 revolution , said this experiment has made her really wonder just how much over the odds we 're paying for products that work no better than their cheaper counterparts @entity36 , @entity37 's beauty expert , who worked on the launch , said of the range : ' @entity8 is a professional quality range which delivers results that could be compared to products triple the price such as @entity44 which includes @entity45 and is available in 16 shades - both a first on the high street			1
' the complexion perfector technology claims to adapt to the intrinsic tone and texture of the skin to give an instant flawless finish with no build - up			2
apparently the first to the mass market , it promises to deliver blendable , full matte coverage that naturally enhances the skin 's radiance			2
one of the £ 4 foundation 's key selling points is that it has been developed in 16 bespoke shades to micro-match the nation 's skin tones			2
the brand also claims to bring the first mass market eye shadow foils , inspired by the latest in make - up trends as seen on the runway , to the beauty sphere for £ 5			1
@entity8 also names its ' hero product ' as a 12 shade eye palette , which costs £ 4 - good value compared to other brands priced at around £ 36			1
@entity76 ' make - up artist , @entity75 , who attended the launch , is a fan			1
she said : ' wonderful collection of vast products which i would certainly keep in my kit			0
astounded by the on - trend colours			2
' a beauty look for £ 12 : @entity8 is a new range of cosmetics priced between £ 1 - £ 12 that promises to match prestige brands on quality			1
@entity91 beauty blogger @entity89 tests it high - end look : @entity26 shows off the results of her designer beauty products , a look that sets her back £ 156 @entity89 , a beauty writer and editor of @entity97 , one of the original @entity91 beauty blogs that gives beauty news and no - holds barred reviews , helped @entity103 put @entity8 to the test			1
as a beauty blogger , @entity26 says she is ' certainly no beauty snob because i ’m game for testing make - up at all price - points ' , but that she 's definitely settled into preferring luxury and high - end products for personal use			1
she said : ' i ’ve tried and tested enough make - up to know that budget brands have upped their game and there is n’t the same disparity in quality that there used to be			1
' testing @entity8 , however , has been a budget revelation for @entity26 ; in the pictures below on the right she 's wearing designer make - up that costs £ 156 , and in the other , on the left , make - up from @entity8 that costs £ 14			1
' @entity128 beauty brands often aim at younger girls who naturally have less disposable income , but in the case of @entity8 it ’s suitable for all age groups , regardless , ' she said			1
on her eyes she used @entity134 1 , £ 4 , containing twelve eye shadows ; a mix of matte and shimmers for picture one and for picture two , she used @entity141 in @entity142 with four shades that have a high sheen			2
cheap vs expensive : @entity26 , pictured , left , wearing @entity148 and , right , wearing expensive products - can you tell the difference ? ' i like to wear my eye - shadow dark and blending is often quite a challenge with blacks and greys , but with @entity134 , it ’s completely easy - in terms of faultless blendability , it outshone my @entity141 colours			0
in terms of wear , there was no discernible difference between the two , ' she said			0
as foundation , she wore @entity166 in picture two , costing £ 63			0
' it ’s my go - to foundation because it contains a hefty whack of anti-ageing ingredients and every little helps ! , ' she said			0
' in picture one i used @entity8 @entity44 , and of all the @entity8 products that i ’ve put to the test , it ’s the one i like least			2
you need to really shake the bottle to get it mixed and it ’s rather runny			0
it gives very sheer coverage and personally , i feel i need a little more			0
' however , if you ’re blessed with flawless skin and love a natural look , then it ’s worth £ 4 of anyone ’s money , ' she explained			0
value for money ? @entity8 , including £ 4 blushers and £ 4 foundation , is hoping to match its high - end competitors on quality for lips , in picture two , she used @entity194 , £ 26 , which she described as ' beautifully creamy ' and ' very luxurious ' , but in picture one she used @entity198 # happylips from @entity8			1
' there is no difference in feel or depth of colour and other than you may find you have to re-apply @entity8 , £ 3 , a little more often , it ’s an easy wear and an incredible bargain , ' she said of the product			2
@entity26 cites her favourite @entity8 item as the @entity209 , £ 3			2
she said : ' it ’s high in pigment and blends very easily onto the cheeks for a pop of colour			0
in picture two i ’m wearing @entity217 , £ 27 , a cheek and lip cream that ’s also easy to blend and gives a healthy flush to my cheeks			0
' however , i ’d say you would be very pushed to tell the difference in performance both on colour pigment and longevity			0
cheap as chips : the new range , although mixed when it comes to quality , starts from just £ 1 at @entity16 ' if anything , the surprise is n’t that @entity8 is such good value , it ’s that the mark up on high - end products is no longer a secret			1
this experiment has made me really wonder just how much over the odds we ’re paying for products that work no better than their cheaper counterparts			0
' i ’ve been using the redemption palette for over two weeks now and i ’m completely unable to tell the difference between that and the costly shadows i used to love			0
' with recent research by @entity254 revealing that even if you go for high street names rather than high - end designer brands , the cost of your average basic make - up bag still adds up			1
they found that the typical woman ’s ‘ everyday ’ make - up bag in the @entity91 contains 14 items ; with mascara , eye liner and concealer the most prevalent products , and the most common brand names being @entity264 , @entity265 and @entity266 so perhaps @entity8 is on to a winner			1
@entity268 also gave the products a whirl			0
we found @entity44 to be near impossible to apply due to its watery consistency and for anyone looking to conceal blemishes and dark spots , the coverage would n't be enough			0
if you suffer from any skin conditions or adult acne , we would advise avoiding the product and instead opt for @entity282 's @entity281 , £ 35 - duly recommended by dr @entity283 , who works her magic on @entity285 and @entity286			2
the eyeshadow was better but the accompanying brushes were very poor quality and made applying them challenging			0
the nail varnishes , on the other hand , were a firm favourite			0
available in a host of on - trend colours ( we love the nude ) , they were easy to apply , glided on smoothly and had a good matte texture and some serious staying power - even without a base and top coat			0
lipsticks were as good as you 'd expect for £ 1 and while they come with a lip gloss , which essentially feels like you 're getting two for the price of one , we prefer @entity308 cosmetics when it comes to pigment , moisturising benefits and staying power			1

@entity8 priced between £ 1 - £ 12
200 items in new range available at @entity16
@entity321 make - up artists have backed it - including @entity323 's
we asked leading beauty blogger to try it out *...* and the results are very *interesting* !
