hunted : an artist 's impression shows a primitive yeti emerging from a cave they have long been thought to be merely the stuff of legend			2
but @entity8 officials say they have found ‘ indisputable evidence ’ that yetis exist – and are living in @entity11			2
the bold claim follows an international conference and expedition to track down the @entity15 in the @entity17 area			1
however , doubt has already been cast on the ‘ find ’ – as the team has no convincing photographic or @entity21 evidence			2
their claim appears to be based on bent branches , a single unclear footprint and a small sample of grey ‘ hair ’ , found in a cave			0
the administration of the @entity31 , where the cave is situated , yesterday announced that ‘ indisputable evidence ’ had been found			0
but critics said the expedition was more about making the area a tourist destination than true science			0
researchers who led the search said that they are closer than ever to catching one the creatures			0
' during the expedition to the @entity45 cave , conference participants gathered indisputable proof that the @entity17 mountains are inhabited by the @entity48 , ' the @entity31 administration announced yesterday			0
' they found his footprints , his supposed bed , and various markers with which the @entity15 uses to denote his territory			1
' the markers appeared to be mainly broken trees and some @entity8 media reports have treated the @entity15 claims with considerable scepticism			1
despite this , the local government officials professed themselves either certain or 95 per cent certain of the existence of @entity15 in a highland area known as @entity17			1
hiding place ? the @entity17 mountains in the @entity31 of @entity8 where the cave supposedly belonging to the @entity64 was found on the trail : a strange footprint found in the snow which the expedition believe belongs to a neanderthal creature the researchers themselves were less keen than the officials to claim the @entity15 is definitely real			1
they stressed that the hair sample should be analysed for @entity21 - a process now underway - before any claims were made			2
a bed of sticks they claimed that the @entity15 had slept on is not thought to have contained hair samples			1
despite this , dr @entity80 , leader of the international event - the first of its kind for half a century , claimed it would not be long before people everywhere would appreciate the @entity15 's existence			1
' we are close to finally finding the @entity15 , ' he said			1
he claims around 30 @entity15 live in the @entity31 , adding that they are @entity90 men who have survived to this day			1
it is clear that since the fall of the @entity94 two decades ago there have been increased ' sightings ' of @entity15 , and it is claimed more than a dozen villagers and hunters in this vast mountainous region close to the town of @entity101 have given written accounts of either seeing the beasts themselves or finding their tracks			1
there are also @entity64 - claimed to be around 7ft - tall - stealing livestock from remote farms			1
the hair thought to be from a @entity15 was found in the @entity31 region 2,600 miles east of @entity111 the first accounts of @entity15 emerged before the 19th century from @entity113 who believed that the creature inhabited the @entity116			1
they depicted the mysterious beast as having similarities to an ape and carrying a large stone as a weapon while making a whistling sound			2
the term @entity15 was developed in 1921 following a book by lieutenant - colonel @entity126 called @entity127			1
popular interest in creature gathered pace in early 20th century as tourists began making their own trips to the region to try and capture the @entity15			1
they reported seeing strange markings in the snow			0
the @entity136 led a trip called the the @entity138 in 1954 to @entity139			0
during the trip mountaineering leader @entity140 photographed ancient paintings of yetis and large footprints in the snow			0
a number of hair samples were also found that were believed to have come from a yeti scalp			0
@entity151 mountaineer @entity150 claimed to have witnessed a creature when scaling @entity153 in 1970			0
he said that while searching for a campsite he heard some odd cries which his guide attributed to a @entity15 's call			2
that night , he saw a dark shape moving near his camp			0
it is understood none of these local eye - witnesses gave evidence directly to the session , though participants heard other accounts from around the globe			2
' we were shown some twisted willow branches that are referred to as markers - they were convincing evidence of this hominoid , ' said @entity175 researcher , @entity174 , who has spent three decades hunting for conclusive proof of the @entity15			1
' there were also some tracks , but we 're not quite sure what to make of them			0
' an @entity182 housewife told the conference she regularly feeds @entity15 in her back garden in @entity185 but was unable to produce a single photograph of an elusive creature rumoured to exist for thousands of years			2
one cynical @entity8 media report summed up the mission as ' we have n't actually found anything , but we very , very much wanted to have found something '			0
shortly before the ' experts ' arrived , another hunt to the same cave to find the @entity15 was led by the ' @entity196 ' - former @entity8 heavyweight boxing champion @entity195			1
it ended in failure , though locals saw it as a key plank in the region 's bid to boost tourism			0
' @entity195 did not manage to meet the @entity64 itself but on the way he discovered ' traces ' such as broken tree branches , ' said a spokesman			0
' i saw lots of journalists but no yetis , ' admitted the boxer			0
@entity215 , vice governor of @entity31 on @entity216 and @entity217 said : ' it does n't matter that the @entity31 might not have @entity15			2
the main thing is that when people come to the @entity222 , they truly enjoy its unique nature			0

villagers say 7ft - tall beast has been stealing livestock
