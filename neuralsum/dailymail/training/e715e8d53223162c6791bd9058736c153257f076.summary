by @entity0 published : 15:50 est , 19 september 2012 updated : 03:10 est , 20 september 2012 @entity1 last night issued an extraordinary apology to the nation for breaking his pre-election pledge to block any rise in university tuition fees			1
in a high - risk move , unprecedented in recent political history , the deputy prime minister took to the airwaves to admit he never should have made the promise			2
the abject nature of his statement , ahead of the @entity14 ’ annual conference , which starts this weekend , dramatically divided opinion at @entity17			1
scroll down to watch admission : in a high - risk move , unprecedented in recent political history , @entity1 took to the airwaves to admit he never should have made the promise critics said mr @entity1 , whose leadership has been under pressure as his party flatlined in the polls , had succeeded in reminding voters of a u-turn that had begun to fade in the public ’s thoughts , while appearing weak			1
but his allies insisted he had made a personal decision to try to draw a line under an issue that had become a ‘ ball and chain ’ around his neck , demonstrating his determination to lead the party into the next election			2
they claimed voters would regard it as refreshing that a political leader had made a direct apology for a mistake			2
mr @entity1 joined all other @entity46 in signing a pre-election pledge to ‘ vote against any increase in fees ’			1
but in coalition with the @entity53 , the party backed a decision to almost triple fees to £ 9,000 a year within months of the election			2
the move infuriated many @entity46 supporters , particularly students			2
it triggered an incredible reversal of fortune for mr @entity1 , who had been treated like a rock star on the election trail after his performance in tv debates			1
i 'm sorry : @entity1 , pictured talking to teenagers at the @entity69 's youth club in @entity17 on wednesday , made the extraordinary apology in a tv piece in a message filmed in his south - west @entity74 home , to be shown as a party political broadcast next week , mr @entity1 insisted he would ‘ never again ’ make a pledge unless he was totally clear it could be met			1
' there ’s no easy way to say this : we made a pledge , we did n’t stick to it – and for that i am sorry ' @entity1 , deputy prime minister he admitted many voters had ‘ strong and pretty mixed reactions to some of the things @entity14 have done in government			1
many of you tell me you ’re glad that at a time of real economic uncertainty , we put aside our political differences to provide our country with stable leadership			0
‘ but , i also meet people who are disappointed and angry that we could n’t keep all our promises – above all our promise not to raise tuition fees			0
’ he went on : ‘ there ’s no easy way to say this : we made a pledge , we did n’t stick to it – and for that i am sorry			0
’ mr @entity1 accepted his apology ‘ wo n’t be enough for everyone ’			1
‘ but i owe it to you to be upfront about it , ’ he added			0
‘ when we ’re wrong we hold our hands up			0
but when we ’re right we hold our heads up too			0
critical : @entity115 's deputy leader @entity114 said ' instead of crying crocodile tears , he ( @entity1 ) should vote with @entity115 to bring these tuition fees down ' ‘ we were right to leave the comfort of opposition to face the realities of government			1
‘ and i know we are fighting for the right things , day in , day out , too : rebuilding our economy to make it strong ; changing the tax system to make it fair ; defending the vulnerable in these tough times			0
’ ' this was @entity1 ’s key election promise when he asked people to vote for his party			1
instead of crying crocodile tears he should vote with @entity115 to bring these tuition fees down ' @entity114 , @entity115 ’s deputy leader senior party sources said mr @entity1 had decided to make the apology over the summer			1
several of his advisers are understood to have advised against the move , with others saying he should address the issue in his conference speech instead			0
but one well - placed source said : ‘ he happens to think that the issue [ tuition fees ] is being used as shorthand or a kind of alibi for people to just stop listening to the good stuff we are doing			2
we hope it will at least earn us a hearing again			0
’ @entity115 ’s deputy leader @entity114 said : ‘ this was @entity1 ’s key election promise when he asked people to vote for his party			1
instead of crying crocodile tears he should vote with @entity115 to bring these tuition fees down			0
’ @entity115 suggested a cut in tuition fees could be paid for by raising taxes on banks , though the @entity162 say the @entity163 has made multiple spending commitments using that money several times over			0
now watch the apology ...			0
