a dossier of shocking cases of pilot fatigue have been released by the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) in a bid to urge the government to block changes to working hours imposed by @entity14			1
the alarming dossier of fatigue cases is published today as the pilots ’ leaders accuse ‘ unelected ’ @entity20 commissioners of trying to force through ’ insane ’ new flying hours rules which they say will put passengers ’ lives at risk by leaving more fatigued pilots asleep in their cockpits			1
alarming : a dossier of shocking cases of pilot fatigue have been released by the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) in a bid to urge the government to block changes to working hours imposed by @entity14 ( file picture ) in the dossier , one pilot also told how , on an another occasion , he had woken up alone in the cockpit of a delayed night - flight after his colleague fell asleep in the toilet			1
another spoke of how he and a colleague messed up a landing at @entity6 ‘ with possible fatal consequences ’ because they were ’ punch - drunk with tiredness			0
’ and a pilot flying from @entity47 to @entity6 filed an anonymous ‘ whistle - blower ’ report after he awoke from his own ‘ tuned out ’ sleep to find his colleague slumped in his seat after ‘ nodding off			2
’ but pilots also said they did n’t always report cases ‘ for fear of reprisals			2
’ pilots ’ leaders claim that @entity14 ’ proposed ‘ unsafe and discredited ’ changes to flying hours and rostered rest - periods will increase the chances of tired flight crew nodding off – sometimes simultaneously – at the controls of their aircraft			1
the new @entity20 rules would allow pilots to land a plane after going 22 hours – and sometimes 24 hours – without sleep , they complain			1
up to one in six pilots have already experienced flights where both pilots have nodded off simultaneously , their own research shows			0
but they say the @entity71 is being asked to rush through automatically the ‘ unsafe and unscientific ’ changes in a vote next wednesday despite rejection of the plans last week by their own @entity76 and in the face of widespread opposition in the @entity79 and across @entity80			0
near miss : in the dossier , one pilot spoke of how he and a colleague messed up a landing at @entity6 ' with possible fatal consequences ' because they were ' punch - drunk with tiredness ' ( file picture ) the @entity90 says : ’ it is a scandal that the unelected and unaccountable @entity92 can force through cuts to @entity79 flight safety			2
’ they say the @entity20 vote is already rigged in favour of the rules being passed automatically on the nod			2
last week the @entity71 ’s @entity76 voted by 21 to 13 to reject the @entity20 plans			2
and mps in the @entity79 have also criticised the changes which are nevertheless backed by the government and the @entity104			0
now the @entity10 has sent a new report to ministers detailing the extent of pilot fatigue to @entity79 transport secretary @entity110 ministers , the @entity104 and the @entity20			1
the testimony also follows publication by the @entity104 of an incident report from a @entity115 pilot flying an @entity116 saying he and his colleague were suffering extreme fatigue in the cockpit after having only five hours sleep over two days			1
but the pair were not asleep ‘ simultaneously ’			0
a @entity10 poll revealed more than half ( 56 per cent ) of @entity79 pilots admitted they had fallen asleep in the cockpit with 1 in 3 of them also saying they had woken to find the other pilot also asleep			1
evidence : the testimony also follows publication by the @entity104 of an incident report from a @entity115 pilot flying an @entity116 saying he and his colleague were suffering extreme fatigue in the cockpit after having only five hours sleep over two days a spokesman for @entity10 said : ‘ @entity79 pilots have urged the @entity79 secretary of state for transport and flight safety regulator , the @entity104 , to protect our skies and today have sent them a detailed breakdown of how the new @entity20 rules will cut @entity79 flight safety by increasing the tiredness of pilots			1
‘ a dossier of personal testimonials from @entity79 pilots giving first - hand accounts of the severe tiredness already experienced by pilots under current higher - quality @entity79 standards has also been sent to the minister and @entity104			0
’ but the organisation says : ‘ the @entity92 has ignored this and is requiring the full @entity71 to confirm the rejection of the unsafe and unscientific rules in a vote on wednesday			0
worried : @entity157 who chairs the influential all - party @entity158 agreed with @entity10 's concerns ‘ half of the entire @entity71 must vote to reject the new rules to stop them automatically coming into place , rather than just those present for the vote on wednesday , when many meps are expected to have already left @entity164 ahead of a recess			0
‘ it adds : ’ this would mean that unsafe new @entity20 rules cutting @entity79 flight safety			0
’ @entity10 general secretary @entity170 , said : ‘ it is a scandal that the unelected and unaccountable @entity92 can force through cuts to @entity79 flight safety that have been rejected by @entity160 on their own @entity76 , @entity79 mps , pilots across @entity79 and @entity80 , scientists and the @entity79 flying public			1
‘ we are urging @entity79 @entity160 , the @entity177 and secretary of state for transport to keep @entity79 skies safe for passengers and urge the @entity92 to go back to the drawing board			0
' @entity157 who chairs the influential all - party @entity158 and is @entity184 mp for @entity185 said : ’ i agree with @entity10 's concerns that the proposed changes to @entity20 rules could endanger air passenger safety			1
' there is still time for the @entity177 and @entity80 to think again			0
’ a @entity193 spokesman said : ‘ we will continue to support the adoption of the proposed regulation as it will improve safety across the @entity20			2
‘ the @entity104 - the @entity79 's specialist aviation safety regulator - is satisfied that the proposed requirements will improve safety across the @entity20 as a whole			2
' flight - time limitation requirements are there to ensure that pilot and other crew members do not operate aircraft with unsafe levels of fatigue			0
‘ the proposed requirements go further than current requirements by obliging airlines to plan rotas and manage crew duties to actively address the risk of fatigue occurring in the first place			0
