migrating geese are able to fly to extraordinary high altitudes because they take a ‘ rollercoaster ’ route , scientists have found			2
scientists have long been puzzled how geese fly to 24,000 feet ( 7,300m ) or more as they cross the @entity6			1
now @entity8 researchers , tracking a flock of bar - headed geese from @entity11 to @entity12 , have found that the birds drop altitude before soaring to new heights			1
rollercoaster ride : scientists studies a flock of bar - headed geese ( pictured ) and discovered that they adjust the altitude of their flight to conserve energy while migrating from @entity11 to @entity12 the scientists , from the universities of @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 , compared the method to the path of a rollercoaster			1
in order to preserve energy , the geese avoid having to flap harder and harder in very thin air			1
instead , the birds track the underlying terrain - even if this means repeatedly shedding hard - won altitude - only to have to regain height later in the same or subsequent flight			1
as the decreasing air density reduces the bird ’s ability to produce the lift and thrust required to maintain flight , they drop down to find more dense air to give them a lift			0
the scientists , whose work is published in the journal @entity53 , used altitude trackers and heart rate monitors to track the geese			2
the bar - headed goose has shown how it manages to cruise at extreme altitudes as it soars above the @entity6			2
it literally puts its heart into the challenge of breathing air consisting of just seven per cent oxygen , scientists found			0
journey : geese flight to incredible heights when they migrate across the @entity6 ( pictured ) available oxygen is channelled to the bird ’s heart , which beats fast to pump oxygenated blood to the rest of its body			0
in this way , the bar - headed goose is able to cross the @entity6 mountain range on its migratory flights between @entity12 and @entity81 , reaching heights of almost 24,000 feet ( 7,300 metres )			1
most people exposed to such conditions would quickly pass out , and may even die			0
scientists believe lessons learned from the bar - headed goose could help prevent heart attacks and strokes in humans			2
lead researcher dr @entity91 , from the centre for ecology and conservation at the @entity95 , said : ' it all seems to come down to how much oxygen bar - headed geese can supply to their heart muscles			1
' the more they can supply , the faster they can beat their hearts and keep the supply of oxygen to the rest of the body going			0
' this suggests that other species , including humans , are limited more by what our hearts can do than by how fit the rest of our muscles are at altitude			0
' @entity116 of @entity117 said : ‘ as even horizontal flapping flight is relatively expensive at higher altitudes , it is generally more efficient to reduce the overall costs of flying by seeking higher - density air at lower altitudes			0
’ professor @entity124 from the @entity125 said the geese would seek out the side of valleys in order to swerve higher - in a way a roller coaster might swoop around a corner and upwards			0
he said : ‘ during these moments , it seems likely that the bar - headed geese are flying on the windward side of a valley wall			1
‘ this would give them the best opportunity to obtaining assistance from wind that is deflected upwards by the ground , providing additional rates of ascent with either a reduction in their energetic costs or at least no increase			0
’ scientists likened the birds ' behaviour to that of a rollercoaster - dipping and diving as the air density differed			2
