being at @entity0 on saturday was a surreal experience – and i ’m not even referring to the @entity5 - @entity4 red card cock - up			1
@entity6 dominated the game , were by far the better side , and they won comfortably			1
but their fans were not satisfied			1
at one point in the first half , a deep @entity6 corner found its way back to @entity14 in goal			2
@entity16 echoed around @entity0 , and then a loud chant rang out : ' attack ! attack ! attack , attack , attack ! ' @entity19 leaps for joy after scoring a brace against @entity22 on saturday as @entity6 won @entity6 only took control of the game after @entity5 was sent off against his former club there is a lack of realism among @entity6 ’s critics and some of the supporters this season			1
they need to understand and accept that it used to be champagne and caviar with @entity36 ; last season was bread and water ; this season it ’s a bag of chips with one of those little bottles of cheap , weak continental beer			1
@entity44 took the club in the wrong direction in so many ways			0
we ’re waiting to see if @entity49 is the right man , but @entity6 ’s football does n’t look good when compared with the recent greatness			1
between 2007 and 2013 @entity6 had the most successful period in their history			2
they won the title five times in that period			0
they made the @entity57 final three times in a four - year period , winning it once			0
it would not be wrong to say @entity6 in that spell were second only to @entity62 in the world , and that @entity62 side under @entity65 is the best club side i have ever seen			2
in the years before sir @entity36 retired , @entity6 were phenomenal			1
that side was arguably their best ever			0
despite the win there were sections of the home crowd that were not totally satisfied with the performance the champagne and caviar days that supporters were used to under sir @entity36 are over some great players contributed to that run of success – @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity19 up front			1
@entity82 and @entity83 – possibly the @entity85 ’s greatest ever centre - half partnership – were rocks at the back			0
@entity88 was the long - awaited replacement for @entity90 in goal			0
and of course @entity92 and @entity94 were still weaving magic spells on the pitch in that side , while @entity98 was as solid and dependable off the pitch as on it			0
of all those names only one is still playing for @entity6 , and he scored both goals in saturday ’s win			1
another – @entity104 – has been injured for most of this season			0
there is an array of talent and character listed there , and that can not easily be replaced			0
shorn of such star quality , a massive rebuild job is now underway			0
and having sunk to an unimaginable low last season under frankly the wrong manager , expectations of @entity6 need readjustment			2
many of @entity36 's title - winning team in 2013 have left the club and it is hard to replace those players @entity36 celebrates winning his final @entity85 title in 2013 before retiring some @entity6 observers seem to think that the signing of a £ 60million player should automatically return the side to the breathtaking football from a few years ago			1
it does n’t work like that – it ’s about building a team after that glorious side under @entity36 was decimated			1
the football has been far from brilliant but it will take time			0
@entity135 started life at @entity0 on fire , but injuries affected him badly , and a burglary has unsettled his young family in a new foreign country , and that ’s clearly impacted on the player ( although his pass to set up @entity146 ’s goal at @entity147 was sublime )			2
in the first half on saturday he was pretty awful but he was also targeted by @entity22			1
first @entity149 , then @entity150 , clattered into him , yet somehow escaped bookings			0
it ’s too easy to break @entity154 ’s spirit on the pitch at the moment			0
but as @entity158 said after saturday ’s game , @entity6 fans have nothing to worry about if they remember this is @entity154 , who is actually one of the world ’s best players most of the time			1
@entity49 is rebuilding the @entity6 team and it is a work in progress @entity135 has been criticised in recent weeks and was awful in the first half against @entity22 there are some surprising positives for @entity6 this season – notably @entity172 , who has been consistently impressive and effective out wide			1
but it ’s a work very much in progress			2
i understand that @entity6 fans want to play football the @entity36 way			1
but you ’re asking too much too soon			0
a few years ago the most successful @entity6 side in the club ’s rich history dominated domestically and were the only side to challenge the brilliance of @entity62			2
fast forward a couple of seasons and that team has been ripped to shreds			0
but it ’s unfair to expect ' @entity36 football ' so soon .			0

@entity6 beat @entity22 2 - 0 at @entity0 on saturday
sections of supporters were not satisfied with the performance
united fans must accept they are not the team they were under @entity36
@entity49 is rebuilding the team and it is a work in progress
