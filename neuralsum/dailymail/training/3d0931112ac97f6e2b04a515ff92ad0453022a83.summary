if ever a game had it all , this was it			0
@entity3 produced one of the greatest backs - to - the - wall performances ever witnessed in the @entity7 , shrugging off the red card shown to their serial miscreant @entity11 to somehow secure an epic victory in a seething @entity14 derby			1
@entity11 ’s moment of madness will attract plenty of attention — and rightly so			1
but anyone present at this game will remember one of the most committed , brave and high - quality displays of recent times by 14 - man @entity3			1
in what was unquestionably the finest game of the season so far , @entity3 centre @entity25 still managed to deliver a performance that stood out from the crowd			1
march 2010 : claims of gouging versus @entity39 dropped when alleged victim , @entity42 , chose not to complain			0
march 2012 : banned for eight weeks for biting @entity44 flanker @entity43 during @entity45			2
june 2012 : sin - binned against @entity46 in first game as @entity33 captain			2
december 2012 : given a two - week ban for striking @entity51 ’s @entity50			2
may 2013 : eleven - week ban after being sent off for swearing			2
december 2014 : sent off for elbowing @entity55 ’s @entity54			1
a fractured hand sustained against the @entity57 robbed the 17 stone centre of a chance to impress for @entity33 in the autumn			2
but on this evidence , @entity63 can already @entity62 ’s name on his team - sheet to face @entity66 on february 6			1
@entity11 was sent to the stands by referee @entity68 for a reckless elbow to the face of @entity55 centre @entity54			1
but @entity25 and his team - mates rolled their sleeves up to deliver one of the great @entity75 wins			0
replacement @entity76 scored the 77th - minute winning try that will etch his name into @entity3 folklore after @entity80 looked to have won the game for the visitors five minutes earlier			1
but there were heroes all over the field for director of rugby @entity87 ’s team , with @entity25 and lock @entity89 to the fore			0
@entity11 ( right ) was adjudged to elbow @entity55 's @entity54 ( left ) before the pair had to be separated spare a thought for @entity3 centre @entity93 , who was replaced 16 minutes into the game following @entity11 ’s latest disciplinary meltdown			1
even he will surely have toasted this remarkable win last night			0
‘ we said at half time we ’ll do this for @entity11 and we ’ll do this for @entity101 , ’ said man - of - the - match @entity25			1
‘ that ’s what it means to play for this club			0
it does n’t get much better than that in a local derby			0
’ the tone was set before @entity11 was sent off for the second time in his career amid an atmosphere unrivalled in @entity113 club rugby			2
@entity11 cuts a dejected figure trudging off the pitch after his sending off as his disciplinary woes continue last year , @entity3 prop @entity117 was sent off for punching @entity55 hooker @entity118			1
the pair exchanging digs from minute one yesterday			0
but @entity11 , who was last night facing the fifth ban of his career , left his side facing over an hour without their leader			1
luckily for him his troops raised their game in epic fashion in a match which saw the lead change hands six times			0
@entity80 ’s try — created by a stunning , weaving run from replacement wing @entity132 — looked to have sealed victory for coach @entity136 ’s side as @entity137 converted to make the score 19 - 16 with less than 10 minutes left			1
but , after turning down a kickable penalty which would have drawn the scores level , @entity3 claimed a line - out and @entity25 charged up the middle to set up a platform which led to @entity144 putting @entity76 in for the vital score			1
@entity80 touches down his second try during the 23 - 19 defeat at @entity3 on saturday ‘ fitness is one thing we pride ourselves on , ’ said @entity25			1
‘ our conditioning staff are fantastic			0
we like to play a high - tempo game			0
‘ we knew going down to 14 players was going to be tough			0
it takes a lot to come from a try down			0
’ while @entity25 was sensational , @entity11 ’s replacement @entity158 was almost his equal			2
day also carried the ball impressively , while @entity144 controlled the game superbly from stand off			0
he was , however , inexplicably allowed back onto the field after appearing to be knocked senseless in the lead - up to @entity164 ’s second - half try			0
@entity164 of @entity3 plays the ball out of the ruck as the @entity3 prevailed 23 - 19 winners @entity55 , who lost @entity169 to the sin bin for a high tackle on @entity171 just before half time , will be distraught to have lost a game they really should have closed out in @entity11 ’s absence			1
but they lacked ballast in the midfield and , a superb scrummaging performance apart , their forwards lacked bite			0
when @entity3 used width , the visitors defence was all at sea			2
both sides scored three tries , with @entity55 ’s coming through a brace from @entity186 and a 21st - minute penalty try , while @entity188 , @entity164 and @entity76 touched down for @entity3			1
@entity33 international @entity25 attempts to avoid the tackle of @entity190 on saturday afternoon @entity87 said : ‘ it was a tremendous , spirited performance with a lot of good technical and tactical work which was so pleasing			0
’ this match really did have it all .			0

@entity3 captain sent off for elbowing @entity55 's @entity54
brawl ensued after @entity11 caught @entity54 in the face after 17 minutes
@entity11 's continued disciplinary *episodes* mean @entity203 could ban the hooker
the @entity206 begins in february , which @entity11 could miss if banned
@entity3 win the @entity14 derby 23 - 19 at @entity34
