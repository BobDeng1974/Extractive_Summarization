he is one of the greatest of the @entity2 poets , was described as ' the handsomest young man in @entity4 ' by fellow writer @entity5 and spent years travelling the world before dying tragically young during the @entity8 campaign			1
but while the later career of @entity13 , the author of the famous line : ' if i should die , think only this of me : that there 's some corner of a foreign field that is forever @entity4 ' , is well known , his time spent travelling in @entity10 is shrouded in mystery			1
there , he was rumoured to have fathered a child with a local woman - rumours that were later brushed under the carpet by his family and have never been proved			1
now @entity26 's biographer @entity25 reveals why she believes the tales to be true - and presents compelling new evidence to suggest that the poet may indeed have been a father , although tragically , he would never know his daughter			1
daughter of a poet : @entity26 , pictured second from right , is thought to be the war poet 's daughter ' the handsomest young man in @entity4 ' : brooke in a 1913 photo taken ahead of his @entity39 trip the soldier , with its famous line : ‘ if i should die , think only this of me : that there ’s some corner of a foreign field that is forever @entity4 ’ , is one of the best - known poems in the @entity50 lexicon			1
but the idea that @entity13 might have had a child , had left a part of himself deep in the @entity55 islands , comes as a surprise to many			1
a child born out of wedlock to a @entity60 woman who some described as a prostitute does n’t fit with the version of @entity26 as a poster boy for the establishment and patriotic feeling			1
in fact @entity26 was a far more complex figure than this version allows : his prose writings give a much fuller picture of the man			0
he wrote a play , many wonderful letters , as well travel essays highly critical of @entity78 and @entity79 attitudes to the indigenous people of the @entity55			2
' the white population of heaven must be very small indeed , ' he claimed			0
he travelled by cruise ship to @entity79 , @entity85 @entity84 , @entity86 and @entity10 in 1913 and his letters home show how bewitched he was by the @entity89 : ‘ hour after hour one may float in the warm lagoons , conscious in the whole body , of every shred and current of the multitudinous water …			1
he was also enchanted by @entity95 , a young woman with ' wonderful eyes ' whom he met at the @entity98 in @entity99 , the capital of @entity10 , in 1913			1
' she has wonderful eyes , the walk of a goddess and heart of an angel , ' wrote a smitten @entity26			0
she too was devoted to him			0
‘ i think i shall write a book about her – only i fear i am too fond of her , ’ he wrote in a letter home			0
the five @entity55 poems he went on to publish in 1914 were infused with love for her and the islands			2
battle : @entity26 was supposed to take part in the @entity8 campaign but was taken ill and died before he arrived that , for most , is where the story of @entity13 , @entity95 and the @entity89 end			1
but evidence suggests that it is n't quite true			0
on his return to the @entity78 , @entity26 wrote to his boyhood friend @entity127 and confessed to a dream in which his beloved @entity95 committed suicide			1
he was clearly worried about her			0
' no mention of a baby , ' he adds , suggesting that the possibility of having conceived one was high and played on his mind			0
a reply from @entity136 eventually reached him via an extraordinarily circuitous route			0
it was dated 2nd may 1914 and began ‘ my dear @entity140 darling ’			2
it had been forwarded from @entity142 , having been recovered by divers from the @entity144 , the ship that had gone down in the @entity146 , taking most of its passengers with it			2
although rather bedraggled by the time he was able to read it , the letter confirmed his suspicions			0
in a mixture of @entity157 , @entity50 and @entity158 his @entity155 girlfriend writes : ' sweetheart ...			2
i grow fat all time			0
' @entity26 ’s reaction is unknown			0
it was n’t until 21 years after @entity13 ’s death that @entity127 began making enquiries about the existence of a child			1
by then 50 years old , a cbe and a member of the @entity174 , it ’s doubtful that @entity127 would have bothered if he had n’t had a strong inkling that such a child was probable , so did @entity26 confide in him ? paradise : @entity26 's five @entity89 poems were published in early 1914 , a year before his tragically early death a corner of a foreign field : @entity26 's own corner is high in an olive grove on the @entity185 island of @entity186 confidential : @entity26 confided in his boyhood friend , the @entity190 economist @entity127 the date of @entity127 ’s detective work coincides with the death of @entity26 ’s mother			1
@entity127 , perhaps sensitive to the hurt it might cause , preferred to let the rumours well alone while mrs @entity26 was alive			0
@entity127 's search for the truth began with a letter to @entity201 , director of @entity202 , asking if he knew of @entity203 , apparently ‘ the only woman that @entity13 really cared about ’			1
@entity201 replied that she was well known to him , lived on @entity205 , and was ‘ still quite a handsome woman and must have been a very attractive girl when @entity26 knew her ’			2
he promised to ask about a child but if he did , there is no record of it			2
@entity201 died in 1951 but his daughter confirmed that her mother had always known that @entity214 , a close friend of the family , was the daughter of @entity26 and @entity216			2
she supplied the only known photograph of @entity218 who died around 1992 ( if born in 1915 she would have been 77 ) , although no records of birth or death confirm this			2
the islands of @entity10 and @entity225 are about as far as it ’s possible to travel from the @entity78 and most biographers , including @entity228 , who came closest to the story in his biography @entity230 , did n’t make the journey			1
in 2006 i began research on my novel @entity235 about the life of @entity13 and made the trip to @entity10			1
despite my enquiries i found no evidence of a child on that research trip so i wrote the novel anyway , using the logic of imagination and the inferences of @entity228 ’s book and @entity95 ’s letter			1
this year – a month ago - i was invited back to a @entity249 festival in @entity10 ’s capital , @entity99			2
while there i did some tv interviews and made general enquiries			0
i did n't look for documents in the knowledge that @entity155 culture is often casual about such things			0
i had some great conversations with other writers and translators and experienced anew the sensory assault that bewitched painters like @entity263 and @entity264			0
@entity26 himself had painted a picture of the scene in words : ' and after dark , the black palms against a tropic night , the smell of the wind , the tangible moonlight like a white , dry translucent mist , the lights in the huts , the murmur and laughter of passing figures , the passionate , queer thrill of the rhythm of some hidden dance , all this will seems inexplicably and almost unbearably like a scene your heart has known long ago , and forgotten and yet always looked for			0
’ still , confirmation of the existence of an @entity26 had n't appeared			0
i returned home , although not before sending an email			0
and i struck lucky , although the evidence was anecdotal			0
the writer translating @entity235 into @entity157 a teacher who lives on the nearby island of @entity295 , mentioned he ’d been talking to a friend about me and my novel			1
his friend , @entity299 , told him that as a child in the 1960s she met a beautiful woman with long grey hair , called @entity26 , living in grand house on the island of @entity205 overlooking @entity10			1
everyone knew , @entity299 says , that her father was the @entity50 poet , @entity13			2
there were children around , small children , thought to belong to @entity218			0
it might not be the dna evidence that a court would want but taken together , to me , there are too many coincidences to overlook			0
i like to think that living quietly in @entity10 are @entity218 's children , the grandchildren of @entity319 and @entity13 - one of the greatest poets the @entity78 ever produced			1
@entity25 is the author of eight novels including @entity322 and @entity235 , about the poet @entity13 ( @entity324 )			1

@entity13 spent most of 1913 living and working in the @entity39
in @entity10 , he met a local woman named @entity95 and fell in love
on his return to the @entity78 in 1914 , he mentioned children to friends
died on a @entity157 *hospital* ship during @entity8 campaign in 1915
biographer @entity25 travelled to @entity10 and is convinced he had a child
says it was common knowledge that @entity341 ' was @entity13 's child
