' it does n’t take a rocket scientist to figure out if you release a report like this at a time when terrorism is surging all over the @entity16 you are handing the other side a recruitment tool , ' ex-cia director @entity18 told the news outlet			1
' it ’s blindingly obvious			0
' people who have read the full report say it shows that the @entity8 interrogation program was far more brutal than previously understood , and that agency officials repeatedly misled @entity35 and the @entity36 about what was being done to @entity39 detainees			1
@entity1 intelligence officials warn that the report could inspire violent protests , such as it happened after the release of photographs showing abusive treatment of prisoners at the @entity48 ( pictured ) violent protests broke out across the @entity16 when photos surfaced showing prisoner mistreatment at the @entity48 prison , such as the one seen here sen. @entity53 , who chairs the @entity54 , has been locked in battle with the @entity56 over the release of a summary outlining the practices			1
