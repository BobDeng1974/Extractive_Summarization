by @entity0 last updated at 3:43 pm on 14th december 2011 the huts at @entity2 were where @entity4 mathematicians worked in secret to crack @entity8 's @entity7 , using desks , blackboards , and feeding their results through primitive mechanical computers that are the grandfathers of the machines we use today			1
many historians say that the efforts of the @entity2 codebreakers shortened the war by up to two years - ending the loss of @entity21 lives			1
but one hut currently stands derelict and others are in need of restoration			2
the @entity26 today received a donation of £ 550,000 from search giant @entity28 - helping to tip the site towards the £ 4.6 million ' match ' fund it needs to receive @entity34 funding			2
working in utmost secrecy , codebreakers at @entity2 cracked @entity8 's ' unbreakable ' @entity7 - and being able to ' listen in ' on @entity38 communications helped to shorted @entity39 the @entity41 decoding machine at @entity2 : the @entity42 were filled with young workers intercepting and decoding @entity8 transmissions @entity45 , director of external relations for @entity28 , said , ' the @entity26 has been doing great work to honour @entity48 and the codebreakers who helped shorten @entity39 and to educate the next generation about the history of modern computing			1
' @entity54 devised an ' electromechanical ' machine that could break the code used by the @entity57			0
he is widely seen as the father of modern computing - but was persecuted for his homosexuality , and committed suicide in 1954 by eating a cyanide - laced apple			0
' the huts were very basic , filled with desks , blackboards - and felt university - like , ' says @entity68 , author of @entity69 of @entity2			2
' the huts were where all the amazing flashing moments of insight happened , though - often with no machinery whatsoever			2
' huts at @entity2 were where many of the moments of inspiration occurred that led to @entity4 cracking the @entity80 - but today one of the main huts stands derelict and two are in need of restoration @entity48 is widely seen as the father of modern computing - but was persecuted for his homosexuality , and committed suicide in 1954 by eating a cyanide - laced apple those huts were terribly cold in winter - most people wore mittens			1
they had sqeaky lino , and dozens of people worked side by side on desks			0
messages were passed between huts down a tunnel on a tray pushed along with a broom handle			1
' it was run by @entity103 - but actually the people working inside those huts were civilians , ' says @entity68			0
' many were mathematicians drawn from universities			0
they would get their summons , but instead of reporting for the front line , they would report for duty at @entity2			0
' @entity2 was the dawn of computer age , ' says @entity68 , ' for young people especially , it 's an amazing insight into how the @entity115 were outwitted and how computing began - in rooms filled with desks , and paper and blackboards , without a machine in sight			1
that 's why this restoration is crucial			0
' the @entity126 decoding machine at @entity2 : the electromechanical methods of ' cryptanalysis ' developed by the team at @entity2 led to the computer age @entity131 operated one of @entity48 's bombe machines used to crack the @entity80 - the machines broke 3,000 enemy messages a day and are said to have shortened the war by two years ' @entity28 ’s backing draws the @entity26 nearer to its goal of developing the site , both to educate and inspire generations to come and as a permanent testament to the brilliant people who worked there , ' said the @entity26 this week			1
' once the remaining funding is in place the @entity26 will get underway with the restoration of iconic codebreaking huts 1 , 3 and 6 and create a world - class visitor centre and exhibition in the currently derelict @entity150 ' @entity151 , ceo of the @entity26 , said , ' we are tremendously grateful to @entity28 for bringing us considerably closer to achieving our development aims			1
' it would be wonderful if other donors follow @entity28 ’s example to help preserve our computing heritage			0
we could then proceed as soon as possible with restoration of the profoundly historically significant codebreaking huts			0

site cracked 3,000 @entity8 messages a day
said to have shortened @entity39 by two years
huts currently stand derelict
site is ' *birthplace* of the computer age '
