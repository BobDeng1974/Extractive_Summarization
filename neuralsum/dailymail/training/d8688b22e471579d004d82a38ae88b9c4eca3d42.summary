the days of a 2point4 children family are long gone			1
there are currently two million lone parent families and 63,000 same sex couple families in the @entity4			0
add to that the 5,206 adoptions that took place in 2012 and the 1950s style of parenting is starting to look as outdated as the era 's hairstyles			2
as one of the most popular members of the @entity16 cast over the last decade , actor @entity11 , who played @entity12 on the tv soap , has become something of a poster boy for this new age of unusual parenting			1
the 40 - year - old and his partner @entity21 , 49 , share daughter @entity25 , four , and son @entity26 , two , with their friend @entity27 , who is also the children 's mother			1
speaking on this morning , @entity11 said : ' i think it ’s important that people recognise there are families like ours out there ' when i was growing up , there were no role models , there was nobody doing what i ’d done and it was one of the big things when i came out , that i worried that i would n’t be a parent			1
' i really wanted to be , but i did n’t know how to go about it			0
' so it ’s really important to talk about this as much as i can , so that other gay people realise that it is a possibility and that it is n’t something that has to be closed to them			0
' @entity27 and @entity11 first started to discuss the possibility of children more than a decade ago , but the friends took their time with the decision in order to make sure they were n't making a mistake			1
@entity11 became a household name after playing the role of @entity12 in @entity16			1
here he is pictured on set with the actress @entity77 within this time , @entity11 met @entity21 and the idea of two parents then became three			1
@entity11 said : ' it was an arrangement that we came up with a few years ago			1
' she really wanted to be a mum , we really wanted to be dads , so we had a serious conversation about it and decided to go down the route of co-parenting			0
' the three adults took the decision making very seriously , with several years spent discussing the pros and cons of having a family together , as well as what their personal styles of parenting would be			2
@entity11 said : ' we talked about it for a very long time , like a decade			2
@entity11 with daughter @entity25 at the ' @entity100 and the @entity102 ' film premiere in @entity103 in february ' we really did discuss every eventuality			1
' we had all of the conversations to start with about school , etc we wanted to make sure we were on the same page			0
' morally , politically we wanted to make sure that nothing was going to come up that was a big issue			0
' while @entity27 lives apart from @entity21 and @entity11 , the three adults share all parenting , with the children living in both homes equally			1
although @entity27 did move in with the men for a period after the birth , she has now moved back into her own home and the three parents relish the freedom co-parenting gives them			2
@entity11 ( left ) and his partner @entity21 at the @entity121 20th @entity120 in @entity103 on 29 march 2014 @entity27 said : ' with both children we lived together for a while at the beginning			1
' it was great , i could n't have done it without them - especially when it was a newborn and a two year old			0
' but we are n't designed to live together - it works because we do n't live together			0
' it can be tough sometimes , it 's freedom as well though - i can go out and not get a babysitter , go see friends , got to the theatre			0
' there are of course moments when you think you would like that other person , we do help each other out though , if the others have commitments			0
' i 'm very proud of what we 've done , because for me being single and hitting 40 , there was no opportunity for me to do it on my on without being a single mum			0
' @entity11 is an ambassador for the @entity148 , taking place this weekend in @entity103			2
