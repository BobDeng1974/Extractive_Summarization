by @entity1 reporter published : 20:53 est , 26 february 2014 @entity3 : 06:01 est , 27 february 2014 @entity4 won the 2009 @entity6 international birdman contest but also claimed the £ 30,000 bonus for ' flying ' 100 metres off the town 's pier a champion birdman was brought down to earth yesterday – losing his court claim for a £ 30,000 prize			1
@entity4 won the 2009 @entity15 contest but also claimed the £ 30,000 bonus for ‘ flying ’ 100 metres off the town ’s pier			1
however , officials said the 51 - year - old managed only 99.86m in his modified glider before hitting the sea			1
it led to a long dispute that ended in @entity25 when his honour @entity26 ruled that he was ‘ not satisfied ’ the competitor had crossed the mark			1
judges conceded that the triangulation technique used to measure flights could be as much as five metres out			1
mr @entity4 , from @entity33 , @entity34 , claimed that the margin of error meant he should have been awarded the prize			1
‘ what i object to is having to fly well past the 100 - metre mark to be awarded a prize for flying 100 metres , ’ he said			1
he added : ' i feel that i went the distance			2
when i came up in the water i was right next to the buoy			2
' birdman judge @entity45 said the distance awarded to mr @entity4 - a hang - glider designer - was the furthest of the organisers ’ calculations			1
he defended the triangulation technique used but conceded it was only accurate to between one and five metres			1
that means the actual result of mr @entity4 ’ flight - in front of thousands of spectators on august 22 , 2009 - will never be known			1
mr @entity45 said : ' it was a brilliant flight			0
if he had just gone a couple of metres past then it would have been a clear win			1
' we judged that the buoys were being dragged back towards the pier at the time and that he fell short of the 100m mark			1
' everyone wants to see it won			2
it would be such a fantastic achievement and great publicity for the event			0
' mr @entity4 said the inaccuracy of the judges ’ measurement technique meant his flight was within their tolerance and should have been deemed a winner			1
he said : ' if they can be up to five metres out then i have clearly flown the distance			2
' i was very lucky to get things coming together on the day and the chances of that happening again are slim			0
' the judges used triangulation and trigonometry , developed by @entity88 mathematician @entity87 , to measure the distance flown by the birdmen judge @entity26 said : ' it is clearly a difficult matter to measure the distance flown by the competitors in this competition and this must be judged against the context , which is of a fun competition with some serious competitors			2
' it has not yet reached the sophistication of horseracing or international athletics and no evidence has been advanced to suggest otherwise			0
' unlike the long - jump or discus , a mark is not left in the sand pit or ground which can then be measured			1
' i conclude that the claimant has not satisfied me that , in accordance with the rules , he flew the required distance and has not made out his case for the @entity114			2
' the judges made a decision not to award the prize			0
the claim is therefore dismissed			0
' he added : ' even if i am wrong and there is now evidence to justify the prize being awarded the evidence did not exist until long after the end of the competition			0
' it was far too late for there to have been a successful challenge by that stage			0
' the judgement came as a relief to organisers @entity132 , which has insurance to cover the cost of a @entity114 win			0
had they lost , they would have faced a huge hike in premiums , which could have threatened the running of the event			0
chairman @entity142 said : ' the birdman event is free to spectators and provides fantastic family fun while raising the profile of the town and raising thousands of pounds for charities			0
judge @entity26 said : ' it is clearly a difficult matter to measure the distance flown by the competitors in this competition and this must be judged against the context , which is of a fun competition with some serious competitors ' ' the @entity132 see themselves as guardians of business and public funds that are used for the good of @entity6 and the last thing we wanted was a legal case wasting money because of a spurious claim			2
' we had no option but to defend our position vigorously and we are pleased that a judge has found our actions to be credible			2
' we can now get on with our objectives and championing @entity173			0
' mr @entity4 said he was ' pretty devastated ' by the verdict having vociferously put his claim across for nearly five years			1
he added : ' i am very frustrated			0
i do not think they understand the ramifications			0
' the ruling is very peculiar and hard to understand but perhaps i am too close to the case			0
' mr @entity4 said costs for the case had not been awarded yet but hoped he would not have to pay both sides ’ legal expenses			1
he added : ' i am not optimistic			0
' the judges used triangulation and trigonometry , developed by @entity88 mathematician @entity87 , to measure the distance flown by the birdmen			0
three observers measured the angle between their points and the landing spot of each @entity193 of them is on the pier below the flyers , one on the promenade at the base of the pier , and one on the promenade at the 100m mark			1
knowing the distance between each of the three measuring points , they then calculate the distance flown using mathematical equations governing the angles within triangles			0
but the system is not perfect and with the buoys used as distance markers tethered to the seabed and therefore at the whim of the tide , it can never be 100 per cent accurate .			2

@entity4 won the 2009 @entity15 contest
he also claimed the £ 30,000 bonus for ‘ flying ’ 100 metres off pier
however , officials said 51 - year - old managed only 99.86m in modified glider
today a judge has said he was ' not satisfied ' he had crossed the mark
