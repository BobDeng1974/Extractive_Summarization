by @entity0 follow @ @ marthakelner @entity1 was only three when @entity2 came from 10 shots back to win the @entity4 in 1999 but that was her inspiration as she mounted her own remarkable fightback at the @entity8			1
the stand overlooking the 18th green at @entity11 buzzed with excited chatter as @entity13 birdied the final hole , completing a stunning round of 66 , arguably her best ever			1
after opening her round with two bogies , the @entity18 teenager carded nine birdies — including five of the final seven holes — to take her to one under and within striking distance of her first major victory			1
on the charge : @entity1 hits her second shot on the 17th hole during the third round @entity13 moved from 51st and 11 shots adrift on friday to tied seventh , three shots behind leader @entity34 of @entity35 going into today ’s final round			1
but for a brief loss of concentration when she three - putted the 17th , she might have been even closer			2
she said : ‘ i said to my dad on friday night , “ i ’m not out of this championship			2
i can still win it ”			2
i remembered @entity2 at @entity42 was 10 shots behind in the final round			1
i did n’t have a score in mind but 66 is definitely nice			1
’ @entity13 , 18 , has boundless potential			1
she was named @entity51 on the @entity52 in 2013 and just over a year on from turning professional she already has one win , five second places and one top 10 major finish to her name			2
@entity13 started hitting golf balls at the age of two and retains a childlike fearlessness in her game , following her uncomplicated mantra of ‘ hit it , find it , hit it again ’			1
‘ i just go out and do my thing , ’ she said			2
‘ i do n’t realise that i play aggressive golf but i probably do			2
if it ’s a stupid pin position , i ’m not going to take it on but if it ’s reasonable , i just go for it			2
@entity72 is a strange sport but it ’s only as complicated as you make it			0
i try to keep it simple			0
’ impressive : @entity1 carded a best of the day 66 to move within three shots of the leader that included visualising the pine and beech trees that line the fairways at @entity85 golf club , her training base between tournaments			1
‘ i find it hard to see links courses because everything is so flat			0
my coach ( @entity92 , who tutored a young @entity93 ) helps me picture the trees			0
it ’s great because i ’m changing the whole picture and it ’s really helped me this week to imagine tree - lined courses			0
’ it served her well on the par - five 18th , where she had racked up a bogey and double bogey on the two previous days			1
‘ i tried to pretend it was a really wide hole and managed to hit the fairway , ’ she said			0
‘ i was most pleased with that because i ’ve nearly hit three balls out of bounds to the right off the tee this week			0
’ several life - size cardboard cut - outs of @entity13 , who supports @entity111 , are dotted around the hospitality centre at @entity11 but she claimed to thrive on the pressure of playing in front of a home crowd			1
‘ i feel i have stepped up and proved myself			0
the pressure is good because it shows you have played well coming into a tournament			0
’ @entity119 returns : @entity34 of @entity35 celebrated 26th birthday with third - round lead and a cake there is a yawning gap of good women @entity127 golfers after dame @entity128 , 50 , @entity129 , 44 , and 41 - year - old @entity130 , who retired this week			1
but @entity13 heads a relative wealth of talented young golfers , including @entity134 ’s @entity133 and @entity136 ’s @entity135			1
@entity1 , who was home schooled from the age of 13 and still relies on her dad driving her to @entity85 to practise until sunset most days , once admitted she could have chosen a very different path			0
‘ i would probably have left school at 16 , ’ she said , ‘ my friends are beauticians and hairdressers and stuff like that			0
my friends who are boys are mostly builders			0
so i ’d have probably gone down the beautician road			0
’ with her pinpoint precision and effortless ability to shoot the breeze it is a career that would have suited her very well , but hairdressing ’s loss is very much golf ’s gain .			0

@entity13 , 18 , is just three shots off the lead after a stunning third round of 66 at @entity11
@entity35 *'s* @entity34 leads by one shot on four under par
