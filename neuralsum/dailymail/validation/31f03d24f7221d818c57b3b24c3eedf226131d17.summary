a sensational 82nd - minute strike from @entity1 snatched victory for @entity4 's @entity3 over @entity5 in their @entity7 elite qualifying opener in @entity8 on thursday			1
@entity4 came from behind twice in the first half as @entity11 and @entity12 's goals were cancelled out first by captain @entity13 and @entity14 as they went to the break 2 - 2			1
they could n't be separated until @entity16 defender @entity1 pulled the trigger from outside the box and his left - footed shot thundered in off the underside of the cross bar			0
@entity22 snatched victory for @entity4 's @entity3 over @entity5 in their @entity7 elite qualifying opener @entity4 : @entity24 ( @entity16 ) , @entity22 ( @entity16 ) , @entity25 ( @entity26 ) , @entity27 ( @entity28 ) , @entity29 ( @entity30 ) , @entity31 ( @entity32 ) , @entity33 ( @entity34 ) , @entity35 ( @entity36 ) , @entity13 ( @entity36 ) , @entity37 ( @entity36 ) , @entity14 ( @entity38 ) sub : @entity40 ( @entity36 ) for @entity33 87 not used : @entity41 ( @entity42 ) , @entity43 ( @entity44 ) , @entity45 ( @entity46 ) , @entity47 ( @entity36 ) , @entity48 ( @entity49 ) , @entity50 ( @entity49 )			1

@entity61 went first for @entity5 a minute after the final goal for an unseemly tackle on @entity37 before @entity28 's @entity27 received a second yellow card in the 87th minute			0
@entity11 's opener came from a long throw just six minutes in with the move immediately after @entity38 's @entity14 almost put @entity4 ahead after a cross from @entity37			2
they levelled when @entity35 found captain and fellow @entity36 star @entity13 , who despite having plenty of work to do evaded two defenders and beat keeper @entity54			0
@entity1 picks up the ball at the top of the box as @entity4 look to create something the @entity16 defender turns inside as the @entity5 defence give him plenty of space @entity1 fires off his bullet - like shot that cannons in off the crossbar and wins the match for @entity4 despite momentum going @entity4 's way and a number of chances going begging , @entity5 were in the lead again in the 44th minute as @entity12 burst into the box and beat @entity24 for 2 - 1			2
in the same minute though @entity111 ’s side were back on terms as @entity14 flicked - on @entity33 free - kick from the edge of the box with the help of a possible deflection			2
neither side took the second half as their own with only half chances coming their way until @entity1 's goal came from seemingly nothing more than the @entity5 defence underestimating his ability from range and giving him too much space			0
@entity4 will play @entity127 in their second group match on saturday .			0
