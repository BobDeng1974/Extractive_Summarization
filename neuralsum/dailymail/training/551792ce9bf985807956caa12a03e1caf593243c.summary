it 's a name that wo n’t register with many @entity2 supporters , but @entity5 ’s @entity4 midfielder @entity3 , no relation to you know who , played two @entity10 games for the @entity12 champions before moving to @entity13 last year			1
there he played for the @entity15 ’ b - team before going on loan to @entity5 this season			1
judging by @entity3 ’s battling performance against the superstars of @entity21 in @entity22 on tuesday night , he might be back one day playing under @entity23 at the @entity24			1
perhaps the @entity43 was aware that it was 11 years to the day that he signed the young @entity45 from @entity46 and wanted to mark the anniversary			0
no show : sir @entity29 chose to watch former @entity41 player ronaldo rather than a trip to @entity37 @entity26 's not so dapper @entity5 coach @entity26 again exhibited his penchant for snappy outfits			1
the @entity53 donned a cheeky dark jacket , with little red elbow pads on the outside , on the touchline			0
not sure , even with his physique and sartorial taste , that he quite pulled it off			0
@entity21 manager @entity61 , meanwhile , looked like he ’s enjoyed a good summer			2
@entity63 : @entity64 looked the part as his side lost out to @entity21 in the @entity28 final video we did our best - @entity26 elsewhere ... @entity70 increasingly looks like the next cab off the rank when it comes to the next managerial appointment in the @entity12			1
@entity61 ’s loyal assistant has worked with some big names now at @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity21			2
he ’s also worked with the @entity80 under 21s and @entity81			0
surely the time is right for the @entity21 coach to get a crack at being the main man somewhere			0
pedigree : @entity70 has worked with some top clubs but has yet to get a crack at being the main man			0

the former @entity2 midfielder was impressive against @entity21 in @entity22 on tuesday night
the on - loan @entity5 midfielder could join @entity93 in @entity13 's first - team if he *continues* in such vein on a *consistent* basis
@entity5 lost 2 - 0 to @entity21 in the @entity28 final with @entity40 scoring twice
