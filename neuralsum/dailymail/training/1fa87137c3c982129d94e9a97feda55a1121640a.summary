by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor beavers living in the @entity4 countryside are to be rounded up by minsters and sent to live in a zoo , it can be revealed			1
environment secretary @entity7 , who once complained about badgers ‘ moving goalposts ’ when carrying out a cull , has now turned his attention to the first family of wild beavers seen for 800 years			1
instead of ordering them to be killed , the @entity14 is trying to find a home for them in captivity , to the anger of wildlife campaigners			2
at least three beavers are living in @entity4 , and have been filmed grooming themselves , gnawing the base of trees and playing together the wild beavers have been filmed gnawing on trees in the dead of night on the @entity29 , near @entity30			1
three were seen on camera , but experts suspect there could be several more			0
ministers have ruled out culling them , amid fears of another animal rights backlash after carrying killing badgers as part of efforts to reduce @entity42 in cattle			2
@entity14 is now drawing up plans to ‘ recapture and rehome ’ the beavers , and officials are desperately trying to find a zoo or animal sanctuary willing to give them a home			1
however , the plan has angered wildlife campaigners , who want the beavers left in their natural habitat to allow them to be properly studied			1
in comments slipped out in a parliamentary answer , environment minister @entity54 said : ‘ we intend to recapture and rehome the wild beavers in @entity4 and are currently working out plans for the best way to do so			1
‘ all decisions will be made with the welfare of the beavers in mind			2
there are no plans to cull beavers			0
’ beavers were hunted to extinction in @entity69 and @entity70 during the 12th century and disappeared from the rest of the @entity72 400 years later @entity14 , @entity69 and the @entity73 are now working on exactly how to catch the animals , and where to send them			1
in january rare footage emerged of the beavers after a retired scientist used an infrared camera to capture them in their natural habitat			1
the animal was pictured in a sequence of shots sinking its teeth into a tree			0
beavers were once native to @entity69 but were hunted to extinction during the reign of @entity90 in the 16th century			1
conservationists have introduced several small groups of beavers back into captivity in the @entity72 , but this is thought to be the first one found living in the wild			1
@entity98 piloted reintroduction of the beaver in 2009 and @entity70 is considering the issue now			0
but the decision to rule out allowing the beavers to stay in @entity69 has been condemned by countryside groups			1
an online petition has been set up calling for the beavers to be left alone			0
@entity107 , conservation manager at the @entity108 , said : ‘ we would like to see the beavers remain on the @entity29			1
‘ the one thing we need to make absolutely clear is we do not want to see reintroduction of species happen in this way bit now they are here and on the river , we want them to remain			0
‘ it is only acceptable if it is proven that they are disease - free , the community need to agree if they want to have these animals on their doorstep			0
‘ and there needs to be an organisation or affiliated group which has got the responsibility to look after them and learn as much as possible about them			0
‘ we have got a huge amount to learn about what these beavers could do for us			0
’ the animalsare living beside the @entity29 , in @entity30 , near @entity135 , @entity4 experts think the beavers most likely escaped from a private collection , rather than being released deliberately			1
‘ beavers are very hard to keep the right side of a fence , ’ mr @entity107 said @entity142 , a wildlife consultant , also opposed the plan to catch the beavers			1
‘ at the moment they are ringing all the zoos and asking them if they will take the beavers			0
‘ what @entity14 should do is look at a more informative project where by the beavers are left and studied – it becomes an @entity154 beaver trial			0
’ he blamed angling groups for demanding the beavers be removed			2
‘ why should three beavers be three beavers too many ? ‘ this will be the first time in history that we have exterminated a native mammal twice , setting an extraordinary historical precedent			2
’ a @entity14 spokesman said : ' we intend to recapture , and rehome these beavers and are currently working out plans for the best way to do so			2
all decisions will be made with the welfare of the beavers in mind			0
' depending on the source of the animals , they could be carrying a disease not currently present in the @entity72			0
in addition , beavers have not been an established part of our wildlife for the last 500 years			2
our landscape and habitats have changed since then and we need to assess the impact they could have			0
