by @entity0 at @entity1 taking the leap and getting a tattoo or a piercing while on holiday may seem like an exciting and exhilarating idea , but an @entity7 medical expert is warning travellers to be aware of hepatitis b and @entity10 risks in the @entity12			1
@entity14 ceo @entity13 has told the @entity15 that medical experts are anticipating a rise in the number of @entity7 people contracting hepatitis b ( @entity21 ) and @entity22 ( @entity23 ) during the coming years			1
she says their pessimistic outlook is based on the lifestyles of holidaymakers and their destination choices			2
the prevalence of hepatitis c in some @entity12 countries is 10 times higher than it is in @entity7 there is currently a vaccine for @entity21 , but health experts are concerned by the lack of a vaccine for @entity23 , which is known as ' the silent killer '			1
many who contract the virus have no symptoms for years and even decades before the virus attacks their liver , which can lead to serious health difficulties			0
victims often suffer from serious liver damage while the risk of cancer is also increased			2
holidaymakers should be safety conscious and careful			0
ms @entity13 said : ' what we want all @entity7 to know before they head off on their overseas holiday is that any activity in which the skin is pierced can lead to infection with hepatitis - and , yes , that can include pedicures , tattoos and piercings , and even getting dental work done abroad			1
' she said the disease is contagious and it can be easily passed on from one person to another			0
she states if an instrument containing a microscopic amount of infected blood is used to pierce the skin or comes into contact with an open wound it has the potential to transmit the disease			0
experts are anticipating a rise in the number of @entity7 contracting hepatitis b and @entity10 in the coming years the @entity14 ceo also warns : ' do n't engage in activities in which the skin may be pierced unless you 're sure the instruments have been fully sterilised			1
' ms @entity13 lists countries in the @entity12 such as @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and the @entity87 as places where the prevalence of hepatitis c can be 10 times higher than @entity7			1
she says inadequate and poor sterilisation of instruments in tattoo parlours or during pedicures are primarily to blame			1
' people on holiday can be more likely to make a spur - of - the - moment decision to take part in more risky activities , like getting a tattoo , so what we 're urging @entity7 to do is pre-plan			1
' if you want to get a tattoo or a piercing while you 're away , do your research so you can better know your risk			2
ask yourself , does the place sterilise its equipment properly ? does the benefit really outweigh the risk ? ' stay on your toes : health experts are warning travellers to be aware of the risks of hepatitis c and c the latest research shows that @entity7 tourists are far more likely now to engage in risky pursuits which puts them at greater risk of contracting hepatitis b and c viruses			1
ms @entity13 believes this is due to a lack of public knowledge about the ailments			0
she advises anybody who is anxious that they may have hepatitis b or c to talk to their gp as a matter of urgency			2
intravenous drug use is the most common way that the viruses are spread , however , hepatitis b and @entity10 can also be contracted by using items such as toothbrushes , razors and nail clippers			2
last week ms @entity13 welcomed the decision to add simeprevir ( @entity146 ) to the @entity147 ( @entity147 ) for the treatment of genotype 1 chronic hepatitis @entity151 there is currently a vaccine for @entity21 , but health experts are concerned by the lack of a vaccine for @entity23 in a press release issued by @entity14 , ms @entity13 said : ' the use of simeprevir as an addition to pegylated interferon and ribavirin to treat people with genotype 1 hepatitis c is an important step forward in the evolution of hepatitis c treatment			0
' ms @entity13 said simeprevir will improve the treatment process as it will make it safer and she called for the therapy to be listed on the @entity147 as soon as possible			0
the ceo also criticised the @entity173 ( @entity174 ) for their decision to decline an application to subsidise sofosbuvir ( @entity178 ) , an antiviral medication			0
she said : ' it 's a sad day when access to game - changing therapy is denied			0
this is a bad outcome for people living with hepatitis c. '			0

lifestyle choices and holiday destinations to blame for likely increase
instruments used during pedicures and tattoos in @entity12 are high - risk
prevalence of hepatitis c in @entity12 is 10 times higher than @entity7
