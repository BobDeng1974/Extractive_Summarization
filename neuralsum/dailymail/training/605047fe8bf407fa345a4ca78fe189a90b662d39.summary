this weekend they insisted that did everything to comply with the law companies sending out ' illegal ' nuisance texts telling mobile users they could be entitled to thousands of pounds compensation for their ' accident ' are raking in £ 175million a year , it emerged today			1
' claim farmers ' bombarded phone users with an estimated 12.75million spam messages last month alone			2
the shady companies are raking in up to £ 500 every time they refer a case to a ' no win , no fee ' law firm - and £ 5 if the phone user replies saying ' stop ' to end the unwanted texts			1
other users have had messages about debt management schemes and claiming compensation for the mis - selling of payment protection insurance			1
once a response has been received the operators know the number is genuine and in use so can sell the details on			1
when sent without the phone user 's consent , the spam mail is classed as a ' cold call ' - which is illegal			2
firms sending out unwanted mail can be prosecuted and fined up to £ 500,000			0
but as messages are often sent out by eastern @entity45 or @entity46 companies from pay as you go mobile numbers they are very difficult to trace			1
text messages are often sent out in bulk from @entity46 call centres or from eastern @entity45 high profile campaign : @entity1 in the @entity54 the firms claim that people receiving spam mail will have opted in to have their details passed on to third party companies			1
when someone responds with details of an accident their contact information is passed on to solicitors to assess whether the individual is eligible for compensation			1
law firms often pay little attention to how the client details were obtained , the @entity67 revealed			0
the texts are sent out via computers to thousands of people urging them to make a compensation claim for their ' accident '			1
they typically cost around 2p a time to send out - but the expenditure is swiftly recovered by the vast fees that can be obtained			0
when a mobile user replies with details of an incident they are passed on to claim firms who in turn give the details to solicitors			1
once a reporter provided details of an invented ' accident ' they were given to leading claims firm the @entity93 which has used television star @entity1 in its adverts			1
the firm , which has a turnover of £ 12million a year , admitted last night they face difficulties working out how client details have been obtained			2
a spokesman representing the firm said that the @entity93 were ' aware of their obligations ' and said it was unlawful to send unsolicited text messages unless they opt in			0
he added that the firm carried out ' due diligence ' and always got written confirmation from suppliers that the law had been complied with			0
but he added : ' the difficulty faced by companies in this field is that whilst due diligence is possible on the companies from whom information is purchased , those companies will in turn purchase information from third parties			0
' spam messages are raking in an estimated £ 175m a year there is no suggestion that @entity1 has done anything wrong			0
regulators have called for referral fees to be banned to put an end to the shady practice			0
although the mobile number the nuisance message sent from can be blocked or deactivated there is nothing preventing the firm from simply using another phone number			2
@entity135 , chief of operations for the @entity137 , who are calling for a clampdown on unsolicited texts , said around three per cent of people reply to the unwanted messages			2
' our research shows that a large percentage of people are receiving spam and are unsure how to stop it and do n't know who to make a complaint to , ' he told the @entity67			0
' mobile spam is causing distress to many people and seriously damaging the legitimate multi-million pound mobile marketing industry			0
' regulators have been unwilling or unable to take ownership and tackle this growing problem			0

a third of mobile users receive the nuisance texts
companies sell details for £ 5 if you reply - and £ 500 if you provide details of an accident
