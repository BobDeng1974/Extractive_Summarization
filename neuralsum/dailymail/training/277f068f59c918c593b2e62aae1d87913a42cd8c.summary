declassified spy photography has uncovered a long - lost @entity2 frontier built by the @entity3 dating from the second century @entity4			1
the site of the wall , which once stood over three metres tall with numerous forts along its length is situated in @entity10			1
named @entity12 's @entity11 , the long wall ran 60 kilometres from the @entity14 to the @entity15 and is considered the most easterly example of a man - made frontier barrier system in the @entity18			1
built in the mid-second century @entity4 the wall once stood eight - and - a - half metres wide and over 3 - and - a - half metres high , including at least 32 forts along its course			2
declassified spy photography ( pictured ) has uncovered an @entity2 frontier built by the @entity3 dating from the second century @entity4			2
the site of the wall , which once stood over three metres tall with numerous forts along its length is situated in @entity10			1
here you can see the square outline of forts along its length @entity27 is near the @entity29 border			0
it stretches for about 73 miles , from @entity31 on @entity32 on the west coast , to @entity34 on the east coast			0
the wall and most of its defenses were built between about 122 and 128 ad			0
its purpose was to mark the northern extent of the @entity18 , which then covered much of @entity41			2
@entity27 was originally constructed in two parts , with the western part of the wall built first			0
it was originally made from turf , allowing it to be built more quickly			0
sixteen forts were built along the length of the wall - each one could house 800 soldiers and had its own prison , hospital , bakery and stables			0
although much of the wall is still standing , over the centuries people have taken away the stones for building			0
several nearby monasteries contain stones taken from from @entity27			0
it is thought to have served a similar purpose to other @entity18 frontier walls , such as @entity27 , which were built to defend the @entity18 from threats to the borders			1
@entity12 â€™s @entity11 actually consists of three separate walls of different dates and while constructions were previously known about , they were wrongly thought to date to the @entity66 or early medieval period			1
although it is estimated that over 50 per cent of all archaeological sites in the @entity70 have been discovered from the air , other countries are less well studied			1
archaeologists believe that examining declassified photographs taken during covert surveillance may herald a new era for archaeological discovery and could help to uncover and identify thousands of new archaeological sites around the world			1
dr @entity79 , senior lecturer in the archaeology department from the @entity81 , said : ' photographs from military surveillance are revealing more than those who took them could have imagined because now , half a century or more later , they are proving to be of enormous benefit in showing us our lost archaeological heritage			1
' thanks to such images , the landscape of this frontier zone is now known to have been as busy in the past as it is today			0
' built in the mid-second century @entity4 the wall once stood eight - and - a - half metres wide and over 3 - and - a - half metres high , including at least 32 forts along its course			2
pictured is a modern aerial photograph of a @entity101 fort tens of millions of images of @entity41 and the @entity104 were taken by @entity105 and @entity107 air forces during the @entity108 and are now held in vast public archives			0
alongside this , a considerable historical aerial resource is also now available from the recently declassified covert @entity114 @entity113 satellite intelligence programme of the 1960s , 70s and 80s , which includes around 900,000 photographs from around the world			1
@entity27 ( pictured ) epitomises @entity18 power			2
it stretched 80 miles from the @entity32 in @entity119 to @entity34 near @entity120			0
in places the @entity121 reached 6m in height and it took three legions or around 15,000 men just six years to build these images are particularly valuable to modern archaeologists as they effectively turn back the clock to a time before recent development changed the face of the landscape through industrialisation , intensive farming practices and urban development			0
@entity136 , professor of @entity18 archaeology from the @entity138 , said : ' we believe we have enough evidence here to demonstrate the existence of a chronologically complex @entity18 frontier system and the most easterly example of a man - made barrier in the @entity18 , serving to block an important and strategically valuable routeway			1
' ' it is an incredibly important discovery for the study of @entity18 history			2

@entity12 's @entity11 ran 60 kilometres from the @entity14 to the @entity15 and would have *measured* *3.8* metres tall and over eight metres thick
@entity70 archaeologists consider it the most easterly example of a man - made frontier barrier system in the @entity18
*university* of @entity81 *experts* believe declassified photographs taken during covert surveillance may herald a new era for archaeological discovery
