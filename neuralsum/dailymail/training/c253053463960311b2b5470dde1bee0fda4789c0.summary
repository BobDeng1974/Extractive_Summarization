i said ' who do you think they will be ? ' she said that she did n't ' think ' she ' knew ' because she saw the list that morning			1
' she relayed whose names were on the list			1
then we agreed to wait and see if that was indeed the @entity65 called that night			0

' but @entity30 has also come forward to deny she made the claims seriously			0
' backstage during the pageant , i did see a piece of paper with names on it and like most people in such frenetic circumstances , joked that they must be the names of the final contestants , ' @entity30 said			2

' she could n’t remember the fifth because she was so upset			0
several of the girls then started hearing through the grapevine about a list ; a lot of people were upset			2

' i do think that would be fair , ' she said			0
' but i could understand how people could be apprehensive to take that road			0
