by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 will play for the first time in @entity4 , the island where his mother 's family hail from , and hope @entity9 's @entity8 play - off can provide the same inspiration it did for him last year			1
@entity2 sparkled against @entity11 , 12 months ago , establishing him in the @entity9 squad after a series of nine loan deals and catapulting him into the @entity17 team for crucial @entity19 qualifiers			2
injuries interfered with the end of the season and forced him to miss the @entity19 in @entity23 but he is fit for today 's game against @entity25 in @entity26			1
home - grown : @entity2 's mother is from @entity4 , where he will play tonight against @entity25 ' the @entity30 game was really the one that made me push on , ' said @entity2 , in an interview with the @entity33			1
' this time it 's special for me again because i 'm half @entity4 and to go out and play in @entity4 for the first time will be quite special			0
hopefully i can get the nod and have a similar impact as i did last year			0
' ' my mum 's @entity4 and i 've got family there who are hopefully going to come and watch me for the first time , so it should be a good game and a special occasion			2
' @entity2 was born in @entity45 to a @entity47 father @entity46 and a @entity4 mother @entity48 , so he could have played international football for @entity4 , but has always represented @entity17			0
he was handed his full debut by @entity51 against @entity52 in october last year and responded with a brilliant goal , the third in a 4 - 1 win			0
@entity8 : @entity2 's performance at last year 's play - off earned him a place in @entity9 's starting xi ' no matter what game you 're playing in , as long as you 're playing in front of the first - team manager there 's always opportunities to impress , whether it 's a training match or a @entity8 match , ' said @entity2			1
' i did that last year and hopefully some of the boys who are on the bench this year can do the same			0
' @entity9 boss @entity71 plans to rest some of his senior stars			0
five of those who started against @entity75 on saturday have not travelled to @entity4 , and there will be opportunities for others , including @entity9 's three @entity79 – @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 - who were not involved at @entity83			2
international : the 23 - year - old 's form earned him a call - up to the national squad last season it ’s not too late to play @entity90 … there ’s £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager @entity93 is to always believe - @entity71			1

@entity2 said tonight 's game will be a ' special occasion '
@entity9 face @entity25 in @entity8 play - off
the 23 - year - old 's mother is from @entity4
@entity2 missed @entity19 though injury
