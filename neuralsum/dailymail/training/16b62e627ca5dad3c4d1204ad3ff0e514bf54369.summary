by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 10:51 est , 4 march 2014 updated : 03:53 est , 5 march 2014 @entity5 could be forced to hand an extra £ 2.5billion to @entity6 to help plug a massive black hole in the @entity9 budget , it emerged last night			1
in a dramatic admission , @entity11 commissioner @entity10 said @entity6 overspent its budget by an astonishing £ 20billion last year			1
mr @entity10 , who blamed the situation on late invoices , said the cash would be taken from this year ’s budget in the short term			2
but officials conceded it was almost certain to lead to a request for a bailout later this year , making a mockery of claims that the @entity9 budget has been brought under control			1
@entity5 faces paying another £ 2.4billion to plug the latest shortfall in the @entity9 's spending a request on this scale would cost @entity5 taxpayers about £ 2.5billion this year – more than the entire annual budget of the @entity32			1
the revelation prompted an angry response in @entity5 , where @entity35 claims he has curbed @entity9 spending			2
@entity38 mep @entity37 , a member of the @entity40 ’s budget committee , said it was astonishing that the @entity9 was asking for more money just three months after it was granted an emergency £ 10billion top - up to allow it to balance its books			1
miss @entity37 , a former chief accountant at the @entity45 , condemned the @entity9 ’s ‘ utter incompetence ’ and ‘ continued disdain with which it treats taxpayers ’ money ’			1
she said @entity57 taxpayers ‘ should not be throwing more money away on failing policy areas ’ , and added : ‘ it seems the @entity45 is not only unwilling but is also completely unable to live within the means agreed			2
it repeatedly comes back , blaming others and looking for more cash			0
’ @entity38 mep @entity37 ( left ) said she could not believe her ears when the @entity45 's @entity10 warned of a new shortfall @entity6 bureaucrats are fighting the introduction of a system to monitor how many hours they actually spend at their desks each week			1
the claim a proposal forcing @entity9 officials to clock in and out of the office is ‘ unsuitable ’ in any ‘ dynamic , modern organisation ’			2
@entity9 officials claim that rather than ‘ excessive ’ checks , working time in the @entity6 institutions should instead be based on ‘ trust ’			0
officials are unhappy that their working week has been increased from 37 hours to at least 40 hours in order to extract more value from their generous taxpayer - funded salaries			0
@entity38 mep @entity78 said : ‘ i really do n't think it is some sort of imposition to ask people to establish that they actually work the hours their contract says they do			1
' it 's what ordinary people do every working day in factories and offices across @entity57			0
" ’ @entity89 , @entity38 chairman of the @entity90 , described the situation as ‘ completely unacceptable ’ , and said @entity5 should refuse any demand for more money			2
he added : ‘ they are stretching the patience of the @entity5 taxpayer beyond breaking point			0
‘ we can not go on just paying up every time they come back with their begging bowl			0
’ @entity102 , of the think - tank @entity103 , said it was time @entity6 put its affairs in order rather than demanding even more cash from @entity5			0
he added : ‘ this highlights the shocking lack of long - term planning or adequate controls in the @entity9 budget			0
any shortfall should be made up from future @entity9 budgets rather than via a fresh top - up from member states			1
‘ the budget needs to be radically slimmed down and overhauled – ending the pointless recycling of regeneration funds among the @entity9 ’s richest members would be a good start			0
’ the @entity123 is expected to oppose any extra cash for @entity6 , as it did with last year ’s demand for £ 10billion			1
but the decision is made by qualified majority voting and @entity6 sources say the @entity5 is likely to be out - voted , as it was last year .			0

@entity45 says it needs £ 20billion extra from member states
comes just three months after demanding an additional £ 10billion
*eurocrats* blame *sudden* *flurry* of invoices at the end of the *financial* year
@entity38 mep @entity37 says @entity9 of treats public money with ' disdain '
