this dramatic footage shows a climber as he scales a sheer 60ft rock face in the @entity3			1
@entity4 was filmed edging towards the top of the cliff - without any equipment to stop him plummeting into the freezing water below			1
the 42 - year - old , who has been solo climbing for almost 30 years , is seen grappling to find handholds and footholds as he edges towards the summit			1
but he admitted there had been times he had fallen and had ' really close calls '			0
he said : ' there 's a lot of feeling and emotions going on when soloing			2
it 's quite complex , yet so simple			2
' although you have to be clear headed before you start soloing , once you 're up there life 's problems just seem to evaporate			1
' of course there are fears and nerves , more so now that i 'm older			0
in fact i do n't really like it anymore if i 'm more than about 60ft up ' i do n't worry about slipping , i worry about my arms tiring rapidly and not being able to hold on			0
it 's all about speed and precision			2
' slipping is uncommon unless i 'm really tired or the standard of the climb is of the upmost difficulty			0
risks : mr @entity4 said slipping is uncommon , but he worries about not being able to hold on if his arms tiring rapidly during an ascent fearful : mr @entity4 said ' his inner mortality was catching up ' with him , which makes climbing more difficult than it used to be struggle : face contorted in concentration , @entity4 clutches to another rock face , high above the rough woodland below planning : the 42 - year - old said solo climbing is about risk assessing , calculating and fine tuning in order to ' minimise the inevitable ' ' in more than 25 years of soloing , i 've had some really close calls			1
