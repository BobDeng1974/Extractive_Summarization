by @entity0 it 's news that may remove some of the guilt when quaffing wine at the @entity4			0
scientists have found that moderate alcohol consumption could bolster the immune system and potentially boost the body 's ability to fight infections			1
the research could pave the way for potentially new ways of improving peoples ’ ability to respond to vaccines and infections , benefiting vulnerable populations , such as the elderly for whom the flu vaccine , for example , has been found to be largely ineffective			1
@entity23 scientists have found that moderate alcohol consumption , such as a glass of wine at dinner , could bolster people 's immune systems and potentially boost our ability to fight infections the study , conducted by an immunologist at the @entity35 and published in the journal @entity37 , could also lead to a better understanding of how humans ’ immune systems work			1
‘ it has been known for a long time that moderate alcohol consumption is associated with lower mortality , ’ said @entity41 , lead author of the research paper and an associate professor of biomedical sciences at the university ’s @entity44			1
‘ our study , conducted on non-human primates , shows for the first time that voluntary moderate alcohol consumption boosts immune responses to vaccination , ’ she said			1
to study the impact of alcohol consumption on the immune system , the researchers trained 12 rhesus macaques to consume alcohol on their own accord			1
they first vaccinated the animals against small pox and then allowed them to access either four per cent ethanol , as well as water as an alternative fluid and food			0
to study the impact of alcohol consumption on the immune system , the researchers trained 12 rhesus macaques ( pictured ) to consume alcohol on their own accord the researchers then monitored the animals ' daily alcohol consumption for 14 months and vaccinated the animals again seven months after the experiment began			1
the team found that over nine months after the animals began self - administering alcohol , their daily ethanol intake varied markedly among them			0
‘ like humans , rhesus macaques showed highly variable drinking behaviour , ’ professor @entity41 said			0
‘ some animals drank large volumes of ethanol , while others drank in moderation			0
’ animals that consumed more alcohol , averaged a blood ethanol concentration greater than the legal limit of 0.08 per cent and were therefore designated ' heavy drinkers			0
' monkeys in the second group consumed less alcohol and typically had blood ethanol concentrations of between 0.02 and 0.04 per cent , making them ' moderate drinkers '			0
‘ prior to consuming alcohol , all the animals showed comparable responses to vaccination , ’ professor @entity41 said			2
the research could pave the way for potentially new ways of improving peoples ' ability to respond to vaccines and infections ‘ following exposure to ethanol , however , the animals showed markedly different responses after receiving the booster vaccine			1
’ the researchers found that as expected , the animals that drank the largest amounts of alcohol showed greatly diminished vaccine responses compared to the control group			2
but animals that drank moderate amounts of ethanol displayed enhanced vaccine responses			0
‘ these surprising findings indicate that some of the beneficial effects of moderate amounts of alcohol consumption may be manifested through boosting the body 's immune system , ’ professor @entity41 said			1
‘ this supports what has been widely believed for some time : moderate ethanol consumption results in a reduction in all causes of mortality , especially cardiovascular disease			2
' as for excessive alcohol consumption , our study shows that it has a significant negative impact on health			2
’ alcohol abuse kills 22,000 people prematurely in the @entity150 , according to @entity151 and approximately 25,000 people in the @entity23 annually			0
around a third of men and a fifth of women in the @entity150 admitted drinking over the weekly recommendations			0
‘ if you have a family history of alcohol abuse , or are at risk , or have been an abuser in the past , we are not recommending you go out and drink to improve your immune system , ' professor @entity41 said			0
‘ but for the average person that has , say , a glass of wine with dinner , it does seem , in general , to improve heath and cardiovascular function in particular , and now we can add the immune system to that list			1
‘ next , we plan to harness our observations made in this study to address bigger questions on the immune system , such as how can we boost our immune responses to vaccination , a particular challenge for our elderly			2

@entity23 scientists have found for the first time that voluntary moderate alcohol consumption boosts immune responses to vaccination

the findings add to those of previous studies that show a glass of wine with dinner can improve heath and cardiovascular function in particular
