by @entity0 with a daily regime that includes 7am starts , intensive military fitness training and a mountain of tack to clean , a stint at the @entity2 in @entity3 would be challenging for anyone			1
but the students who take the 10 - week intensive courses offered by the college are no ordinary teens			1
many have been in trouble with the police , can barely read or write and have been expelled from school			1
' without this place , some kids would probably never achieve anything , ' explains @entity20 , the course manager			2
' all our kids are turnarounds			2
every one of these kids has come in here with a goal and if we can get them out into a racing yard , then they might achieve that goal			1
' ambitious : @entity28 was expelled from school aged 14 and can barely read but dreams of becoming a jockey now the school is to feature in a new @entity33 documentary that follows the teenage pupils as they bid to overcome their problems and become the @entity37 winners of the future			1
among them is @entity40 , 15 , from @entity41 , who has spent most of her short life in and out of trouble with the police thanks to her penchant for fighting			1
' a lass came to pick on us one day , ' she says of her last fight			2
' she started saying stuff about about my family and pulled my hair , and i flipped			2
but i 'd really damaged her and put her in hospital			0
i got expelled for it			1
she adds : ' my mum and i do fight			0
we start punching each other			0
i 've got scars all over my knuckles from fighting with her			0
' joining her is traveller @entity28 , 16 , from @entity65 who was expelled from school aged 14 and struggles to read and write but dreams of becoming a jockey			1
naughty : @entity40 , 15 , has been in trouble with the police because of her penchant for fighting the dream : @entity28 and @entity40 dream of emulating @entity76 , winner of last year 's @entity37 ' if i 've had a bad day then i 'll jump on a horse and it 'll calm me down , ' he explains			1
' i 'm hoping to be a jockey			0
if i did n't have this opportunity , i 'd probably be riding around with horses , signing on the dole and i do n't want that			1
' both will take part in a 10 - week intensive course at the @entity89 , after which , provided they pass , they will be given a placement in a racing stable and the chance to become a professional jockey			1
but it wo n't be easy			0
instructors at the school enforce a tough regime with strict rules on behaviour that include prohibitions on swearing , wearing make - up and fraternising with the opposite sex			1
along with yard duties and riding , the teens also have to endure daily bootcamp - style workouts under the eagle eye of military fitness trainer @entity108 - much to the horror of many			1
' he 's evil ! ' sniffs @entity40 after being made to complete laps of the paddock followed by a tough set of squats and lunges			0
@entity108 is less than impressed			0
' the racing industry 's hard - it 's hard , ' he explains			1
' they need to grow up a little more and toughen up			0
' toughening up is a key part of the educational experience at the @entity2 , although maths and @entity122 also form part of the curriculum			1
' we have all sorts , ' adds @entity20			0
' we have students that come in with very low level of education			1
we have students who come in that would struggle to write their own name			2
' but while he 's sympathetic , it swiftly becomes clear that @entity20 has no intention of putting up with teenage tantrums once his students arrive on the gallops			1
hard work : fitness is a crucial part of becoming a racing jockey - hence the military style workouts painful process : students at the @entity2 spend hours riding , then do hours of yard chores ' whinging and whining - you always get this in the first couple of weeks but we 'll soon knock it out of them , ' he fumes after hearing @entity40 moaning during a circuit on the gallops			1
' everyone 's got their own style of teaching and mine 's probably more aggressive than most but that 's what some of these kids need			0
' one who seems to need a bit of tough love is @entity28 , who repeatedly invites the ire of instructors thanks to his constant larking about			0
' sometimes you 're teaching him and he thinks he knows best , ' grumbles @entity20			0
' @entity28 's come here on the attitude he 's going to get by on his charm , what little he has , and now he knows its about hard work			0
he needs to stop being a boy and start being a man			0
' despite the harsh regime , it becomes clear that the school has worked wonders on the troubled teens by the end of the course			1
@entity40 , who arrived with a hair trigger temper and an over-reliance on her fists , seems calmer , while @entity28 manages to pass his @entity122 and maths exams for the first time			0
graduates : a handful of students are given placements on racing yards after completing the course future star ? @entity28 , who passed the course , says he plans to go on and become a race - winning jockey ' i have changed ... i 've changed quite a lot , ' says @entity40 , who will be heading home to @entity41 after the course ends			1
' i was one of the worst when i got here but my attitude , my anger levels ... they 've just changed			0
' @entity28 , by contrast , is staying on to be primed for a career as a racing jockey - much to the tearful delight of his parents and @entity218			2
' i 'm over the moon , ' he beams , utterly thrilled			0
' i had to go and call my @entity218 [ to tell her he passed the course ] , and she said she felt like crying			0
i have made me family proud and me mum 's proud of us - i definitely will make it as a jockey			2
' ' it 's not all about the horses , ' explains an equally proud @entity20			2
' it 's about putting a good grounding into them so that when they go to a trainer 's yard , they might not be the finished product but they 'll be well on the way to it			2
' not every student is cut out for racing but we can train them up to the point where they 'll be of value to someone			0
' jockey school , tonight at 9pm on @entity33			2
