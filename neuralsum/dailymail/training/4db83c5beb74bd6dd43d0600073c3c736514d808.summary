by @entity1 reporter published : 17:51 est , 31 march 2012 updated : 17:51 est , 31 march 2012 fape ? six - year - olds are being asked to read the words to test their literacy levels in tests carried out this summer a government initiative to test school literacy levels will see more than 500,000 six - year - olds asked to read ‘ words ’ such as jound , terg , fape and snemp			1
during the summer term , teachers will sit down individually with every year 1 child and ask them to read the so - called ‘ pseudo-words ’ as a way of gauging reading levels			1
officials preparing this year ’s test are having to ensure that none of the non-words is offensive or rude in the mother tongue of pupils whose first language is not @entity26			1
the government is pushing ahead with using the pseudo-words in the tests despite the results of a public consultation in which two - thirds of people said they should not be included			1
the non-words will have a picture of an imaginary creature next to them as a signal that the word is made up and could be the name of the pretend creature			2
each child will have to read a total of 40 words ; 20 real ones such as week , chill , grit and start as well as 20 non-words such as spron , stroft and ulf			2
the idea is that the test will establish how well schools are teaching phonics , a system in which children learn the sounds that groups of letters make rather than just remembering what different words look like			2
the results will be fed back to the @entity61 , which will use them to compare schools and analyse whether it helps to improve reading			0
professor @entity65 of the @entity66 said : ‘ clearly , non-words do n’t have any meaning			0
understanding meaning is the essence of reading so we must ask if this test really assesses reading			0
‘ attention to other aspects of reading such as enjoyment and comprehension are likely to be restricted because of the focus on phonics			0
’ the government is taking action after it was revealed last year that one child in six fails to reach the required reading level before going to secondary school .			0
