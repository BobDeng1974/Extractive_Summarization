by @entity0 published : 14:25 est , 18 february 2014 @entity2 : 03:30 est , 19 february 2014 crime scenes can be notoriously difficult to examine without disturbing the evidence , yet one police service in @entity6 has come up with a novel solution			1
officers from @entity9 are using a handheld 3d scanner to perfectly record computer models of indoor and outdoor scenes of crime			1
called @entity15 , because of the way it moves like its namesake in the @entity15 , the scanner has previously been used to produce models of famous landmarks and shipwrecks , yet this is the first time the technology has been used to fight crime			1
this converts 2d measurements into a 3d field of view			0
using data collected by the scanner , police in @entity9 have been able to quickly recreate indoor scenes , like the one pictured , on a computer @entity15 works by emitting laser beams while rotating around a spring that continuously scans the environment			1
this converts 2d measurements into a 3d field of view and is capable of collecting over 40,000 range measurements in just one second			0
using data collected by the scanner , police investigators can quickly recreate the scene on a computer in @entity48			1
they can locate and tag evidence , pinpoint particular areas of interest and rotate the room or landscape to view it from any angle			0
' the benefits of [ @entity15 ] will reduce interference at a scene , save time and allow access to previously hard to reach areas such as step declines and bushland , â € ™ said @entity64 commissioner @entity63			2
' this cutting edge technology is allowing us to adapt to a new environment of ongoing change and improvement			0
' crime scenes are renowned for being difficult to investigate due to the delicate nature of preserving evidence			1
equally , outdoor crime scenes including dense forests , caves , or other vast areas can be time consuming to examine thoroughly			1
using @entity15 , also known as @entity78 , police can now easily access these hard to reach places and map confined spaces where it may be difficult to set up bulky camera equipment and tripods			2
it also means less disturbance of the crime scene and scans can be uploaded in almost real - time			1

unlike wheeled mobile systems , @entity15 can operate on stairways and rough terrain and the system is also accurate in areas without @entity101			0
@entity15 works in a similar way to the mapping drones seen in sci - fi film @entity104 ( 2012 )			1
it scans the environment and uses the images it collects to build 3d interactive models crime scenes are renowned for being difficult to investigate due to the delicate nature of conserving evidence			1

the technology was created by @entity133 - based firm @entity132 ( @entity132 ) in 2010			0
@entity15 has previously been used to capture world heritage sites in a bid to preserve them			2
it was recently used to scan the complex interior of the @entity139 , for example			0
it is now available commercially and its makers are working on ways it can be used in forestry , mining and classroom learning			0

it was recently was used to scan the complex interior of the @entity139 , for example , pictured the @entity9 initiative was a joint project between , from left to right , @entity132 's dr @entity154 , @entity155 , information technology , innovation and arts minister @entity156 , sergeant @entity157 , pictured holding @entity15 , and @entity159 , @entity160 and emergency services minister @entity158			2

@entity162 is a @entity48 handheld scanner that maps scenes in almost real - time
it creates interactive models that can be *annotated* , tagged and rotated
the technology has previously been used to map famous landmarks
police officers in @entity9 were the first to use @entity15 to fight crime
it maps crime scenes quickly and easily without disturbing the evidence
technology is similar to the mapping drones used in 2012 film @entity104
