by @entity0 what a difference a week makes			1
after the defeat at @entity4 it felt like the entire country was against us but the reception we — and @entity8 in particular — got at @entity9 last week made us realise just how much goodwill there is for us			1
i do n’t think i ’ve ever seen or heard a reception like the one @entity14 got just for scoring 48 not out at lunch			1
he ’s had some personal stick from a couple of people recently but to get that kind of support from the crowd was such a great boost for him and the entire team			1
to win every session of the match is unusual and it was satisfying to respond to the loss at @entity4 in such a positive fashion			0
i was determined to be aggressive and express myself and put all my knee issues to one side			1
it ’s like when you tell a kid not to spill a drink when they walk into a room — all they will think about is spilling the drink ! at @entity56 fell into the trap of thinking ‘ my knee is sore ’			0
i think it worked because the knee felt as good as it has all year			2
see you later ! @entity62 is dismissed by @entity0 during day three at @entity63 in @entity9 teamwork : @entity65 holds up the match ball as he celebrates taking his fifth wicket during the third test at @entity69 ’s i was having hot baths in the middle of the night just to get some warmth through it but i can honestly say that i ’m more confident about getting through all five tests than i have been at any point this summer			1
having @entity14 back in form is a massive boost			0
none of us had any doubt he would come through because he ’s a world - class player and that ’s what they do			0
let ’s hope he can score a couple of hundreds to set up a series win			0
@entity65 gets better with every match and is now a really strong option with the ball			1
i ’ve known him for a number of years and he ’s great to have in the dressing room			0
in test cricket you ’ve got to learn on the job because it is so much more intense than county cricket			0
@entity65 ’s really doing that and that is a great testament to him			2
a word on @entity104 , too			2
what a terrific debut ! early days but very promising .			0

@entity107 said reception in @entity9 showed people still support @entity25
@entity0 thinks the reception for *captain* @entity8 *'s* 48 was like nothing he had ever seen or heard
the *28* - year - old was far happier with his own performance against @entity27
he says he was determined to be aggressive with his bowling during @entity118
@entity0 also praised the contributions of @entity65 and @entity104
