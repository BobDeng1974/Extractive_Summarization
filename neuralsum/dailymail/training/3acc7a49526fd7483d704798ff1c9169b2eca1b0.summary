by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 05:45 est , 7 november 2013 updated : 20:50 est , 7 november 2013 @entity3 yesterday accused @entity4 of sneering at politics while making £ 1million a year reporting on it			1
the @entity8 host has admitted he failed to vote at a recent election and has criticised the ‘ green - bench pantomime ’ in @entity11			2
but he was denounced by the @entity13 leader , who said on his @entity15 show : ‘ he ’s a guy who gets paid £ 1million or thereabouts , paid for by taxpayers , he lives off politics and he spends all his time sneering at politics			0
‘ it ’s sometimes unedifying , but this idea that you just can sneer at the whole thing , dismiss everybody as being rogues and charlatans , and say , well therefore i ’m going to wash my hands of the whole thing , is a total abdication of responsibility			1
’ mr @entity3 launched the outspoken attack on the @entity8 star for claiming he finds the crop of politicians so ‘ unappetising ’ he could not be bothered to vote			1
the @entity13 leader said he had an ‘ old - fashioned view ’ that anyone unhappy with politics should ‘ get stuck in ’ and change things not sneer from the sidelines			0
he said mr @entity4 , as one of the @entity8 ’s most high profile political interviewers , had a responsibility not to undermine democracy			1
‘ i just have this old fashioned view if you want to improve something get stuck in and get your hands dirty and change			0
do n’t somehow pretend you can turn your back on it , ' he said			0
mr @entity4 has admitted his refusal to vote should disqualify himself from commenting on political affairs			1
grilling : mr @entity4 is one of the @entity8 's top political interviews , and has often confronted mr @entity3 on @entity8 @entity4 has also turned on his fellow @entity8 journalists for taking part in shows like @entity75 and @entity76			1
he said he would pay good money ' not to watch newsreaders making t * * * * of themselves			1
' in an interview with @entity82 's @entity81 he said : ' i do n’t understand why they want to do it ' , although he did admit that it helped to raise money for the children 's charity			0
he revealed he had twice been approached by producers of @entity76 to appear on the show , but said : ' you want your head examined to do that			1
' mr @entity4 's @entity96 colleague , @entity95 , is currently appearing on the latest series of @entity76			1
and it comes just days after fellow @entity8 presenter @entity99 ended last @entity101 ’s edition of @entity8 with a dance			0
but he said he agreed with comedian @entity104 ’s recent assessment that voters are ‘ disillusioned ’			0
writing in the @entity106 , mr @entity4 said : ‘ in one recent election , i decided not to vote , because i thought the choice so unappetising			1
‘ by the time the polls had closed and it was too late to take part , i was feeling really uncomfortable : the person who chooses not to vote – can not even be bothered to write “ none of the above ” on a ballot paper - disqualifies himself from passing any comment at all			0
’ mr @entity3 ’s outburst came after a listener complained that too often new governments spend their time unpicking the work of their predecessors			2
instead , every constituency should have a @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity13 representative elected separately who would sit in @entity128 in permanent coalition , it was suggested			0
but mr @entity3 dismissed the idea out of hand : ‘ i do n’t agree that we eliminate choice , eliminate the argie - bargie of politics , unattractive though it might seem at times			1
‘ of course , imperfect though our democracy is , at the end of the day it ’s the best way we can have people articulating conflicting views about the future and resolve them peacefully , and then govern the country as well as we possibly can on behalf of the people - in a way which is legitimate because it 's backed by whatever happens in elections			0
’ the row over voting was sparked by an interview mr @entity4 conducted with @entity104 , in which the comedian said he had never voted because he regarded politicians as untrustworthy and irrelevant			2
despite criticising mr @entity104 during the interview , mr @entity4 later admitted he had some sympathy with his position			2
' @entity104 has never voted because he finds the process irrelevant			0
i can understand that : the whole green - bench pantomime in @entity128 looks a remote and self - important echo - chamber			0
but it is all we have , ' mr @entity4 said .			2
