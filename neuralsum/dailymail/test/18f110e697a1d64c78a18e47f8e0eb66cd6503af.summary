@entity7 and married couple @entity8 and @entity9 all appear in on the video announcing @entity12 's 2016 bid			1
they are part of a diverse group of people - from young mothers and people preparing for retirement , to @entity21 - speaking brothers preparing to start a business and an asian - american college graduate looking for her first job - chosen to show aspirational citizens as @entity12 looks to speak to to wide demographic of voters			1
' @entity0 need a champion , and i want to be that champion , ' @entity12 says on the video			1
' so i 'm hitting the road to earn your vote			0
' but far from being ' everyday @entity0 ' , as the two minute video claims , @entity7 and @entity8 are directly involved with the @entity3 - just like campaigners @entity36 and @entity38 , from @entity39 , @entity40 , who discuss their upcoming wedding plans on screen			1

featuring snappy music , and showing @entity12 for less than half the running time , it is a dramatic departure from the campaign launch of seven years ago , which showed the secretary of state on a couch , talking about ending the @entity147 war , shrinking deficits and expanding affordable health care			1
the 2015 video has managed to strike a chord with a range of people , with @entity83 campaigners @entity36 and @entity38 talking about their up - coming nuptials capturing people 's imagination			2
