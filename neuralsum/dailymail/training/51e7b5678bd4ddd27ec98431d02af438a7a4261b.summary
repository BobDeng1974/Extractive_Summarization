last month @entity0 , 19 , revealed she had caught @entity1 while cleaning an open wound on her pet cat , @entity4 a teenager told last night of her horrific ordeal of catching @entity1 from her pet kitten			1
in what is believed to be the first case of its kind in the world , @entity0 was struck down with pneumonia and had to have emergency surgery			1
the 19 - year - old was later rushed back to hospital in agony for further treatment for severe lung damage			1
another victim suffered the same symptoms of bovine tuberculosis and @entity0 ’s mother @entity23 contracted the dormant form of the disease			2
it also emerged that a child from the south west caught @entity1 from a pet dog			1
the youngster , who was under 10 , eventually recovered , but the dog was put down			0
it is thought that the pair who caught the disease from a cat did so when cleaning a wound on the pet , which they had taken in only five weeks before			1
@entity0 said : ‘ i lost a stone and half in five weeks , i was very ill and had fevers , cold sweats and hallucinations			1
i did n’t realise what was real and what was n’t			0
’ the kitten , which is thought to have picked up the disease from badgers , has died from the illness			1
thirty - nine people who may have been in contact with infected cats have been offered screening for @entity1			1
@entity0 was diagnosed with the disease in october after a vet raised concerns about an outbreak among cats in the @entity59 area of @entity60			1
seven of the nine infected creatures had bite wounds thought to have come during fights with badgers			1
six have been put down or have died and an 18 - month - old tabby named @entity67 has vanished			0
@entity0 is now categorised as being at no risk of passing on @entity1 despite her emergency readmission to the @entity70 last month			1
she is on a nine - month course of antibiotics			0
she said : ‘ i feel much better now , last year was very tough especially because i did n’t know what it was			0
’ @entity4 : both @entity75 and her mother @entity23 caught the disease from this kitten , though @entity23 only contracted a dormant form - meaning she is infected but has no symptoms her mother said : ‘ for the first three weeks @entity4 was fine then he became poorly and we discovered he had an open wound under his belly			1
we took him to the vet two times and the third we kept him in			0
‘ he died two days later			0
we had no idea it was @entity1			2
‘ but we were very careful and conscious to be clean around him but somewhere along the line we were n’t as careful as we should have been			0
‘ when @entity92 died we were told they ’d run some tests as he died so suddenly and then we found out he had tb			0
@entity96 , who is the vet who reported the outbreak as well as being the owner of missing @entity67 , believes it started with a local herd of cows contracting @entity1			2
he is treating the two surviving cats despite @entity103 , the chief veterinary officer , stating : ‘ for public health reasons the most sensible course of action when a cat is diagnosed with culture - confirmed @entity108 infection is euthanasia rather than treatment			1
’ dr @entity96 said : ‘ the @entity113 ’s advice is correct but we ca n’t force the pet - owners to put their animals to sleep at the moment			1
‘ we can give them advice and inform them of the risks			0
every case has to be looked at individually			0
the two cats we are treating at the moment do not have any external sores so they are both low risk			0
’ @entity127 confirmed two patients infected by the @entity129 were undergoing treatment			0
officials said two others have been diagnosed with latent @entity1			2
this means they have been exposed to the disease but are not showing symptoms			0

’ the @entity140 farming industry is forced to slaughter 30,000 cows with @entity1 each year			2
in total nine cats are known to have been infected			2
@entity143 ( left ) died after contracting the disease , while @entity145 ( right ) was put down in keeping with guidance from the @entity148 's chief vet it is argued that the spread of the disease is accelerated by badgers and the government is undertaking a cull to try to combat the problem			2
it is rare for cats to contract @entity1 , with about 25 cases each year in @entity148			1
the nine infected cats all lived within three miles of each other – and six within a 250 - yard radius			1
another pet owner has told of her anguish after her cat contracted tuberculosis and had to be put down			0
@entity165 , 38 , said that when @entity145 developed a painful lump on his paw she and husband @entity166 , 34 , had no idea it could be the disease			0
