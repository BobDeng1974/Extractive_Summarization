she came to @entity1 for a fresh start , a chance to put her chaotic @entity5 lifestyle behind her			1
it was , she insisted , time to ' grow up '			0
but @entity8 's hopes of starting anew could unravel as early as this week – and in spectacular fashion			1
the actress faces allegations that she failed to complete 240 hours of court - ordered community service that she had vowed to carry out in @entity15			1
and embroiled in the controversy is a prominent @entity1 charity , which has been accused of helping her inflate the number of hours she spent carrying out her punishment			1
@entity1 charity @entity25 ( pictured ) has been accused of helping her inflate numbers the claim raises the question of whether @entity25 ( @entity29 ) colluded with the actress in exchange for publicity – an allegation the charity denies			1
miss @entity8 arrived in @entity15 last autumn to star in a @entity36 production of @entity38 's play , @entity39			2
it would , she hoped , prove her credentials as a serious actress			0
but at the time she had still not completed the community service she received for reckless driving after her @entity46 collided with a truck in 2012			1
an @entity49 judge agreed to allow miss @entity8 to complete the hours in @entity15 with the help of @entity29 , whose chairman is @entity52			1
now , according to official documents filed in the @entity49 courts , the charity says she has not only completed the 240 hours , but exceeded them in the short time between october and january			1
but @entity57 has seen documents and spoken to well - informed sources which suggest she has done no such thing , raising questions about what activities have been logged as ' community service '			1
@entity8 was quick to post a photograph of herself with @entity29 's @entity68 ( left ) , director of volunteering operations , and @entity71 ( centre ) , director of external affairs and fundraising , on her @entity75 a source close to the @entity39 production told this newspaper that miss @entity8 's plans to fit her punishment around the play 's demanding schedule had ' always been a concern ' for producers			1
' the people behind the play wanted to know if she would be able to do both , ' the source said			0
' @entity8 's people insisted that they would be able to work it into her schedule , but it was clear that it would not have been possible			2
' that question appeared to be a key topic at her initial meeting with @entity29 on october 6 last year			2
according to another source , the subject of inflating miss @entity8 's hours was openly discussed			1
' they knew they could n't do it , ' said the source			0
' the question was asked if the hours could be padded			0
you know , could they say she did 90 per cent of it ? @entity29 said they would see what they could do – wink , wink – and mentioned fundraising and publicity			1
' the source added that @entity112 was then quick to post a photograph of herself with @entity29 's @entity68 , director of volunteering operations , and @entity71 , director of external affairs and fundraising , on her @entity75 account , which has almost 3 million followers			2
under the picture she wrote : ' another great meeting with @ @entity121 making a difference every single day			0
' she accentuated the message with symbols of a heart and hands in a prayer position			0
' it was all , ' what can we do for her and what can she do for us ' , ' said the source			0
in other documents seen by this newspaper , @entity29 agreed to sign off hours for @entity112 ' retroactively ' and also agreed that the initial meeting between the actress , her team and @entity29 could count towards her total			1
it was also asked whether miss @entity8 's appearance at last year 's @entity142 in @entity15 could count towards her punishment			2
@entity29 suggested that it could			2
the charity advised miss @entity8 's team that this would not be linked to @entity29			1
but according to the official log , four hours were assigned by @entity29 on the day of the awards			1
the log also says miss @entity8 spent 56 hours working with or on behalf of @entity29 's charitable community project , the @entity151 in @entity152			1
@entity49 officials have their doubts			0
@entity155 , lead prosecutor in miss @entity8 's @entity49 case , last month challenged both the type of work @entity112 claimed to have done – and even if she had done it at all			2
the star 's official volunteering log submitted to the court states that she carried out administrative and planning work with the charity , agreed to ' meet and greet ' young volunteers after performances of @entity39 , and allow other young volunteers to shadow her			0
miss @entity8 arrived in @entity15 last autumn to star in a @entity36 production of @entity38 's play , @entity39 , pictured yesterday at the launch of ' @entity172 , we 've got issues ' at @entity174 her ' work shadowing ' role was ' most questionable ' , mr @entity155 said , telling a court : ' work shadowing basically is hanging out with her			2
i 'd love to hang out with a celebrity			0
that 's not community service			1
' but he also took issue with the timeline of hours on miss @entity8 's log			1
he questioned , for example , just how the star was able to complete 30 hours for @entity29 from january 19 to 21 while also being treated for a virus picked up in @entity189			1
' [ a ] note says she received acute care for three days , but on those three days , again , ten hours [ per day ] were served , ' mr @entity155 told the court , adding : ' i 'm having trouble not only with the quality of the work but whether or not the work was actually done			0
' last week it was reported that miss @entity8 successfully lobbied @entity49 car insurance firm @entity199 to donate $ 10,000 ( £ 6,500 ) to @entity29			1
@entity29 is well respected , so how did it come to be embroiled in this way ? was the organisation star - struck by the actress , hungry for the publicity @entity112 could bring with her 8.8 million @entity205 followers ? ' this girl has manipulated a @entity1 organisation , ' the source said			1
' they were hoodwinked into letting her get away with it			0
people are in awe of @entity8			2
but this is celebrity manipulation and it 's not fair			0
she did the crime in @entity217 so should have done the punishment there			0
' it 's one rule for ordinary citizens and another for celebrities			0
she did n't do those hours			0
it makes a mockery of the legal system			0
this is someone who has had so many chances			0
but now i wonder if this community service hearing is going to be the crunch ? will she now go to jail ? ' mr @entity155 told @entity57 that a prison sentence would not be ruled out for @entity112 if she is found in breach of her probation terms on wednesday			1
despite her wild child reputation , she is understood to have conducted her working life with some degree of professionalism			0
although @entity39 is thought to have lost £ 200,000 , cast and crew were impressed by her performances			0
miss @entity8 's spokesman would not comment on the allegations last night			2
@entity29 chief executive @entity245 said : ' i am not aware of anything which would support such an allegation			2
we take our responsibilities in relation to all kinds of volunteering with great seriousness			0
