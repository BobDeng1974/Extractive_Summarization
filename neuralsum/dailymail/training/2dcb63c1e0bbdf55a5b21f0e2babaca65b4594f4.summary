businessman @entity0 is not the first man to ‘ trade his wife in ’ for a younger model			2
but the multi-millionaire ’s ex-wife – the mother of his 13 - year - old son – opted for a decidedly 21st century revenge			0
instead of giving away the 63 - year - old property developer ’s favourite claret or chopping up his suits , @entity9 took to the social media website @entity14 to provide her rival with a devastating critique of him			2
devastating critique : @entity9 posted messages on the @entity14 page of her ex-husband 's new partner @entity20 which accused him of trying to strangle her			1
miss @entity20 subsequently ended the relationship after finding @entity20 ’s online page , the 46 - year - old equestrian posted a series of damning messages – visible to all @entity29 ’s @entity14 friends – in which she said her ex-husband had tried to strangle her and was a love cheat			1
‘ i hear you have been together 2 years ? ’ she wrote			0
‘ if so u might like to ask him who he was in bed with the last time he was arrested			0
‘ would n’t bring it up			0
last time i accused him of cheating he spent a night in the cells , tried to strangle me			0
police do n’t take too kindly to finding your wife with your hand prints round her neck			0
’ in a barbed sign - off , she added : ‘ but do n’t worry , you will get a nice watch for @entity50 ! ’ the withering messages were read in horror by @entity29 , a divorced mother of two			0
court action : @entity0 has , in response , issued a £ 150,000 writ for libel in the @entity57 against his ex-wife , which she intends to defend but ms @entity9 – who had never met the younger woman – had more to say			1
she emailed miss @entity20 ’s ex-husband too , saying she believed mr @entity0 had ‘ deep psychological problems and anger management issues ’			1
she also wrote : ‘ he likes to watch porn and leaves the television on all night			0
’ this , apparently , proved the final straw for @entity29 , who walked out on mr @entity0			1
as a result , the businessman has issued a £ 150,000 writ for libel in the @entity57 against his former wife , which she intends to defend			1
mr @entity0 , who lives in a £ 2 million detached house in @entity75 , @entity76 , admits that his 2012 divorce – after 14 years of marriage – was ‘ acrimonious ’			1
his ex-wife , a professional event rider who runs her own stables , lives 20 minutes away , in her own £ 2.5 million detached property			2
she is currently being treated for breast cancer			0
mr @entity0 admits in the writ that , since may 2011 , before his divorce , he had been in a relationship with miss @entity20			1
but he claims that the email sent to miss @entity20 ’s ex-husband last year implied that he was ‘ a dangerous and thoroughly disreputable man ’ as well as being ‘ a vile , angry misogynist , who was psychologically unwell and unfit to look after children ’			2
ms @entity9 , however , stands by her accusations and , according to her lawyer , vigorously contests her ex ’s counter-claims			2
mr @entity0 is also seeking aggravated damages due to ‘ the gratuitous nature of her communications with @entity20 ’			1
the posts were apparently widely read , causing mr @entity0 ‘ embarrassment and stress ’			1
miss @entity9 's £ 2.5million @entity76 home : her ex-husband 's claim is on hold while she battles cancer a close friend of mr @entity0 said : ‘ @entity0 offered @entity9 the chance to apologise and withdraw the comments			1
@entity0 has now split up with @entity20 because of all this			1
the incident that @entity9 brought up was over 12 years ago			2
they were having an argument and @entity0 put his hand over her mouth to stop her shouting because he thought it would wake their baby son @entity116 up			0
’ @entity118 , representing ms @entity9 , said : ‘ the court has ordered the claim to be put on hold as my client is receiving treatment for breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy on wednesday			0
‘ but for this delay my client would either have applied to strike out the claim or served a defence which would have set out her case			0

@entity0 's ex-wife @entity9 told his new lover that he was a love cheat
she claims he tried to strangle her when she confronted him over *infidelity*
after the messages , @entity20 decided to break up with mr @entity0
now he has issued a libel writ against his ex-wife for £ 150,000
