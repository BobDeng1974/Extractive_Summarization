medicine could be delivered via a high - speed pressure jet through the skin in a new needleless method developed by scientists which could spell the end of painful injections			1
the @entity9 - style device , unveiled by scientists yesterday , can be programmed to deliver a range of doses to varying skin depths			1
the breakthrough will be a welcome relief for those with phobias of needles who may avoid immunisation because of their fears			0
researchers now think they have come up with a similar system which produces a high - velocity jet of drugs to penetrate the skin			1
the device is said to be a major improvement on some fledgling jet - injection systems that have been developed			1
the researchers say that among other benefits , the technology may drastically cut the number of accidents among doctors and nurses who accidentally prick themselves with needles			0
out of this world : the system is similar to the ones used by dr @entity35 in @entity9 a needleless device may also help improve compliance among patients who might otherwise avoid the discomfort of regularly injecting themselves with drugs such as insulin			1
@entity67 , a member of the research team at the @entity69 , said : ' if you are afraid of needles and have to frequently self - inject , compliance can be an issue			0
' we think this kind of technology ... gets around some of the phobias that people may have about needles			0
' in the last few decades , scientists have developed various alternatives to hypodermic needles			0
for example , nicotine patches slowly release drugs through the skin			0
but these patches can only release drug molecules small enough to pass through the skin 's pores , limiting the type of medicine that can be delivered			2
now an @entity69 team , led by professor @entity93 has engineered a jet - injection system that delivers a range of doses to variable depths in a highly controlled manner			1
the design is built around a mechanism called a lorentz - force actuator - a small , powerful magnet surrounded by a coil of wire that 's attached to a piston inside a drug ampoule			0
when current is applied , it interacts with the magnetic field to produce a force that pushes the piston forward , ejecting the drug at very high pressure and velocity ( almost the speed of sound in air ) out through the ampoule 's nozzle - an opening as wide as a mosquito 's proboscis			1
no more fears ? the breakthrough is bound to be a welcome relief for those with needle phobias in tests , the group found that various skin types may require different pressure to deliver adequate volumes of drugs to the desired depth			2
ms @entity67 said : ' if i 'm breaching a baby 's skin to deliver vaccine , i wo n't need as much pressure as i would need to breach my skin			2
we can tailor the pressure profile to be able to do that , and that 's the beauty of this device			2
' the breakthrough is reported in the science journal @entity145 and @entity146			0

high - speed pressure jet *administers* medicine through the skin
device is similar to the system used by dr @entity35 in @entity9
