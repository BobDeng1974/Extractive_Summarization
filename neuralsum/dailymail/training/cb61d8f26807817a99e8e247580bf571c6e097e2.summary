@entity1 boss @entity0 has warned his players to beware the unique threat of a resurgent @entity4 when the @entity1 take on high - flying @entity5 at the @entity6 on saturday			1
former @entity7 star @entity4 grabbed two goals as the @entity5 soared to their current fourth place in the @entity11 table with a 3 - 1 win over @entity13 on sunday			1
and despite his side succeeding in shutting out both @entity15 and @entity16 in recent weeks , @entity0 knows they will have to be fully focused to prevent more goals from the 6ft 4ins front man			1
@entity1 boss @entity0 believes the @entity1 must be wary of @entity5 striker @entity4 @entity1 boss @entity0 thinks @entity4 offers a ' special ' and ' different ' challenge to his players @entity0 said : ' @entity4 is special and different and i do n't think you can find another one of him in the game right now			1
' the adrenaline of being out for a while has brought him back at the highest level you can have and you need to be able to deal with that			0
' it 's a difficult game and we have n't had that kind of challenge yet of a player like @entity4 , so the goalkeeper and the centre - halves and everyone else are going to have a difficult afternoon			2
' having come through a gruelling period relatively unscathed - @entity37 's mauling apart - @entity0 has now switched his attention to his side 's festive programme as he looks to build towards a repeat of last year 's end - of - season form			1
@entity5 are flying as @entity4 ( left ) celebrates scoring their second goal against @entity13 @entity44 has signed a new contract to keep him at the @entity6 until 2019 fast - upcoming games against @entity7 , @entity47 and @entity48 appear to represent more opportunity to turn a recent glut of four draws from their last five games into much - needed wins			1
@entity0 added : ' the challenge is to win as many of the next four games as possible			2
we are not looking to have four draws and if they are normal games without any accidents we need to win			0
' we are going to play the four to win and then the season will be totally different			0
winning games puts you in a different situation - it brings your confidence back			0
' last year we started getting better during this time and we had a very good run of results and took it into january , so we are looking at this period in a very special manner			0
' @entity70 has steered @entity5 to fourth in the @entity11 after 15 games @entity0 is set to recall @entity72 to his starting line - up after the striker was an unused substitute at @entity75 following a slight knock which forced him off against @entity77			1
@entity78 is available again after missing the game against his parent club but is likely to have to settle for a place on the bench , while @entity83 and @entity84 are both still injured			0
@entity0 was buoyed this week by @entity44 's decision to sign a new four - and - a - half year contract , adding : ' i 'm very pleased because it was n't easy			2
' the time was great for us and @entity44 to get to know each other better and show what he 's capable of			0
there are not too many young @entity95 centre - forwards free so it was important for us to tie down @entity44 for another four - plus years			0
' former @entity98 man @entity97 has brought @entity99 to the @entity5 midfield @entity101 came off the bench to fire @entity5 into a 3 - 1 lead at @entity104 on sunday			2
