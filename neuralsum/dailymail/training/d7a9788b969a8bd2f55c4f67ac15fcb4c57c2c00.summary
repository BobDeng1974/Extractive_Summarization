@entity0 has called a truce in his uneasy relations with his @entity4 team - mate @entity3 , though the circumstances surrounding how and when he tweeted the news are fishy			1
late on friday afternoon @entity0 purportedly told his @entity8 followers : ' we 've been friends a long time			2
as friends we have our ups and downs			0
we 're cool and still friends			2
' the timing was mysterious as only a few hours earlier a @entity4 spokesman had told @entity16 that he thought @entity0 was in the air , travelling to @entity18 ahead of the @entity20 @entity19 in @entity21 on june 8			0
old mates : @entity0 says he and @entity3 are ' still friends ' after their recent tensions in @entity25 buddies : despite the driver 's championship favourites clashing @entity0 says they remain close the tweet also came soon after @entity30 had flagged up on @entity8 that they wanted viewers to join in their debate on the @entity34 - @entity3 relationship , which was pulled apart when the @entity35 controversially beat him to pole position in @entity25 last week			1
@entity0 believed @entity3 deliberately drove down an escape route to bring out yellow flags that thwarted his final flying lap. @entity30 tweeted : ' on tonight 's @entity41 , we want your views on the growing rivalry between @entity0 and @entity3			1
' that was at 4.22pm			0
@entity0 's tweet came 11 minutes later - and an hour and a half after @entity16 specifically enquired whether @entity0 and @entity3 had spoken			1
backflip : @entity0 said he and @entity3 were just colleagues following the controversy in @entity51 start to finish : @entity3 won the @entity53 from pole position with @entity0 holding on for third white flag : @entity0 tweeted that he and @entity3 had made up challenged about the timing of @entity0 's tweet , which carried a well - chosen picture of the two drivers larking about on bikes as boys , @entity4 said he sent the text of his volition for no more intriguing a reason than what it said reflected the up - to - date situation			1
that is certainly the case			0
however , @entity4 are acutely aware of the dangers and opportunities presented by @entity8 in setting the news agenda			0
they now say @entity0 will fly over the weekend .			0

@entity0 tweeted on @entity3 ' *...* we spoke . we 're cool and still friends . '
the @entity77 and his @entity35 team - mate 's friendship was tested in @entity25 , where they finished one - two
@entity0 thought @entity3 deliberately forced a yellow flag in *qualifying* to ensure he *secured* pole position , though he was *cleared* by *stewards*
he said after the race : ' we 're not friends . we are colleagues '
@entity0 and @entity3 's relationship goes back to junior go - *karting*
