staff at a piggery have been left shocked after arriving for work one morning only to be confronted by an ' ocean ' of about 500 dead pigs			1
it is believed that the pigs at the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) in @entity8 , @entity9 , died of extreme heat exhaustion , after an air - conditioning system in the holding shed failed on february 23			1
according to an anonymous whistleblower 's tip - off to @entity16 , a security company was alerted when the system faltered but they failed to contact on - call employees to notify them in time and all 500 pigs in the piggery baked to death			1
over 500 pigs have died in a piggery in @entity9 due to heat exhaustion after an air - conditioner broke @entity7 ceo @entity26 claims the company , who employ 25 staff , are thousands of dollars out of pocket and all the staff are traumatised by the incident			1
he said that further investigation into the disaster appeared to show that the shed did not have an adequate ventilation system			1
' we have 24 - hour monitored alarm systems , ' mr o ' @entity36 said			2
' in this instance the alert was unable to avert a disaster â€“ a situation every business dreads			0
' the consequence was distressed staff arriving onsite the following morning to discover the stock losses			2
' mr @entity26 told the newspaper that such a loss has been emotional for the staff , who invest a lot of their time into caring for the pigs			2
in may last year , @entity8 piggery came under scrutiny when video footage appeared online apparently showing piglets in pieces and pregnant sows confined to tiny stalls			1
at the time , @entity63 told the newspaper that the video footage of the piglets scattered across the ground was clearly staged			0
@entity7 ceo @entity26 claims the company , who employ 25 staff , are thousands of dollars out of pocket and all the staff are traumatised by the incident ' these people have broken and entered in these properties in the dead of night and disturbed and distressed the animals , ' ms @entity73 said			1
' they portray this as the way the pig industry does business and that 's not the case			0
speaking to the @entity86 , animal protection group @entity85 expressed his concern over the fact that the pig deaths had been covered up			0
' that these animals reportedly died in such a horrifying way , and the public and relevant authorities have apparently been kept in the dark for weeks , raises serious concerns around the transparency and accountability of this industry , ' a spokesperson said			0
' this represents a disgusting and unacceptable failure to ensure animal welfare , and one which would have caused those 500 sentient beings unimaginable suffering			0
' the whistleblower is apparently a member of staff and was reportedly told by management that they would lose their job if they told anyone			0
however ceo mr @entity26 has denied this .			0
