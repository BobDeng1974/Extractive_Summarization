@entity1 biologist : @entity2 has worked with lobster breeding since 1996 off the coast of @entity5 sick of the snow , the ice and the brutal cold weather ? then spare a thought for @entity2 who has been stranded on a island off @entity12 for more than a month thanks to heavy ice			1
with no helicopter available to pull her out and crossing the mile stretch to the mainland on foot or in a vehicle too dangerous , marine biologist @entity2 has been running low on supplies			1
iced - in on @entity20 for the past 32 days , @entity2 was delivered from hunger pangs by friends who chartered a plane to drop food and supplies for her and her dog , as the winter shows no signs of ending anytime soon			1
having spent the past 15 - years on the island where her nonprofit @entity30 has a six - acre lobster pond , @entity2 , 54 , has said this winter is by far the worst she has known			1
' i 've been iced in for 32 days , ' said @entity2 to @entity33			1
' the longest i 've been trapped on the island before was two weeks			2
' ' i still do n't know how much longer i 'll be stuck here , ' she said			2
boats have been unable to leave @entity38 for three weeks after this years painful winter that has seen temperatures rarely rise above freezing			0
while @entity2 does n't have running water she does have her dog , phone , a stove , electricity and the @entity46			1
however , her friends began to worry about her and organized a care package which they dropped in by plane			0
all alone : @entity2 is seen here from the plane hired by her friends to air drop supplies to @entity20 over the weekend relief is on the way : friends of @entity2 load up their plane with coffee and fresh meat and dog food friends to the rescue : @entity62 - shoving the first box out the window while the temperatures stood at minus 10 degrees remote : @entity2 is currently working on @entity20 - which is visible in this picture as the furthest speck on the archipelago they loaded three boxes with food and hired a pilot to fly over the two mile long and half - mile wide island so they could get low enough to drop the boxes safely			1
the temperature was a chilly minus 12 degrees when they made the drop			0
' the pilot was awesome , ' said @entity62 to @entity33			0
' he did a couple of flyovers and got his bearings , ( then ) opened the window and said , ' @entity84 it			0
' and i did , twice			0
' while the first box hit the roof of one of the buildings on the island , the second one made a perfect landing			0
' i was thrilled , absolutely thrilled , ' said @entity2 to the @entity94			2
' and i also like the idea this could be done because it gives a whole new dimension to getting stuff out here longer term			0
' @entity2 usually stocks up with two months of food to be on the safe side when she departs for the winter and keeps herself warm with a wood fire and solar panels for electricity			2
but next year she says she is going to bring along a small box of treats which she will label , ' do n't open until february ' , just to be on the safe side			0
low flying : the plane hired by @entity2 's friends casts a shadow on the pack ice as it prepares to make its food drop the @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity62 who banded together to help marine biologist @entity120			1

@entity2 , 54 , has been stuck on @entity20 for more than a month
heavy ice has blocked her leaving and a helicopter has been *unavailable* to reach her
