former @entity1 captain @entity0 has launched a scathing attack on manager @entity3			1
@entity4 defender @entity0 claims the management style of the @entity6 , who took over at @entity8 in february , actually contributed to their relegation last season			1
the 33 - year - old also feels @entity3 is not the right man to lead @entity1 to promotion next term			1
' he 's a very strict manager and his main tool is to try to mentally and physically batter his players and hopefully get some results out of that			0
' is that the right fit for @entity28 football ? i do n't think so			0
i thought rather than help us try to avoid relegation he made things worse			0
' i hope i 'm wrong but i do n't think he is the right man ( to get @entity1 promoted ) and things will get worse before they get better			2
' tough regime : @entity0 hit out at @entity38 's style of management and said he would not win promotion @entity0 left @entity8 under a cloud this summer after six - and - a - half years in west @entity42 , and last month revealed he only found out he was being released from his contract via email			1
but the player added he would have been willing to stay with the @entity46 in the @entity47 had he received assurances about the future direction of the club			0
he said : ' with the right signs and the right players coming in i would have been prepared to stay			0
' there was a release clause in my contract which they decided to take			0
i would have hoped for at least ( to have been told ) face - to - face or a pat on the back after six - and - a - half years			2
' @entity1 have since insisted that ' all personal protocol was followed ' when @entity0 was informed of his release			2
allowed to leave : @entity0 says @entity1 told him his time at the club was up via email			1
