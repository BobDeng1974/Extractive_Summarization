by @entity0 , @entity1 deputy political editor police officers investigating the @entity4 scandal secretly obtained the telephone records of the senior @entity7 journalist who first broke the story , it has been revealed			1
a metropolitan police report into the ongoing saga , which was published yesterday , revealed that the force arrested an officer on suspicion of leaking information to the @entity15 after analysing the phone records of the newspaper 's political editor @entity17			1
@entity19 also obtained call records to the @entity15 to try to identify a second potential source providing information about the @entity4 row in which the former @entity25 chief whip @entity24 was accused of swearing at police officers guarding @entity26			1
police officers secretly obtained the phone records of the @entity15 's political editor @entity17 the @entity28 have accused the police of an ‘ outrageous abuse ’ of their position , while @entity25 mp @entity32 today demanded to know if journalists ’ sources were safe			1
mr @entity17 did not know that his phone records had been secretly obtained by the police			1
under the @entity38 police have to go to court to ask a judge ’s permission to get records belonging to a journalist			2
journalists are then notified to give them the chance to fight against their records being investigated			0
@entity48 , of the @entity28 , said : ‘ instances like this amount to the outrageous criminalisation of sources who have taken the decision that information they are in receipt of deserves to come to the attention of the public			0
' she added : ‘ if whistleblowers believe that material they pass to journalists can be accessed in this way – without even the journalists and newspaper knowing about it – they will understandably think twice about making that call			0
' a @entity15 spokesman said the newspaper was ' concerned ' about the revelation			2
he said the @entity15 understood the intrusion ' was authorised by a police officer rather than a judge , for the apparent purpose of exposing a whistle - blower who was ultimately shown to have committed no criminal offence '			2
the spokesman added : ' we understand this was achieved , without our knowledge , by the use of police powers under the @entity82			0
' this circumvented the normal safeguards in the @entity38 , which was designed to give proper protection to journalists and their sources			0
' we will be writing to lord justice may , the interception of communications commissioner , to ask him to examine how many times and with what justification these authorisations have been made against the media and whether he intends to issue any guidance on the media ’s right to keep their phone records safe			2
' the @entity15 first published a front - page story on september 21 , 2012 , revealing mr @entity24 had clashed with armed officers at @entity26 after they refused to let him cycle out of the main gate			1
the revelation sparked a political row , eventually forcing mr @entity24 to resign from the @entity105			1
but the @entity25 mp has consistently denied calling the police officers ' plebs '			1
it has since emerged that officers ' conspired ' to undermine mr @entity24			2
the revelation that police secretly obtained mr @entity17 's phone records emerged after the @entity114 published a series of documents summarising its inquiry into the aftermath of the plebgate incident , which resulted in four police officers being sacked			1
yesterday 's report identified a female officer who texted a colleague two days after the incident to declare that she could ‘ topple ’ the @entity25 government			2
the report also contained new @entity129 footage of the heated disagreement between diplomatic protection officer @entity131 and then chief whip @entity24 at the gates of @entity26 in september 2012			1
the man , who is clearly seen following the exchange , has never been traced			0
today ’s @entity129 footage shows mr @entity24 cycling down the middle of the street and then talking to three officers at the gate while a fourth stands nearby outside			2
in the original police account , several members of the public are said to have witnessed the exchange and were ‘ visibly shocked ’			0
a @entity165 documentary for @entity166 challenged this with images obtained from @entity129 shot from within @entity26			0
but today 's separate @entity129 footage shows there were at least three members of the public outside the gates at the time of the row			0
at least one appeared to be listening to the exchange			0
@entity179 alleges mr @entity24 called police officers ‘ * * * * ing plebs ’ during their exchange			1
mr @entity24 denies he used the word ‘ pleb ’ but has apologised for swearing			1
@entity25 mps and supporters of mr @entity24 said that , despite the report being a ‘ police report into the police ’ , it still showed dishonesty by officers working in @entity26			1
they said serious questions must now be asked about whether the @entity195 in charge of guarding no. 10 was fit for purpose			0
mr @entity198 , a former shadow home secretary , said : ‘ what we have got here is evidence of industrial - scale dishonesty			0
there was a pack of policemen telling a pack of lies			0
this involved serious collusion between police officers who set out to harm the democratically elected @entity212			2
‘ despite their attempts to justify their action on security grounds , it transpires that the only written guidance was that ministers should have ‘ unfettered access at any time of day or night and at any entry point ’			0
@entity25 mp @entity222 said : ‘ this overdue report offers further evidence of the concerted deception used by police officers to stitch up @entity24			1
‘ it ’s shocking that specialist officers recruited to protect @entity26 saw fit to engage in such an outrageous plan to topple a senior minister			0
it ’s a serious blow to public confidence in the police			0
’ conservative mp @entity24 was targeted by a police conspiracy after swearing when blocked from cycling through the main @entity26 gates			1

police probing @entity4 saga accessed phone records of @entity240
the revelation was buried in a @entity19 report published yesterday
@entity25 mp @entity24 was accused of calling police officers ' f * * * * * * plebs '
former chief whip admitted swearing but denied using the word ' pleb '
the original story was published in the @entity15 newspaper sparking political row
