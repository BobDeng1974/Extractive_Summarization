by @entity0 published : 06:53 est , 9 october 2013 updated : 10:05 est , 9 october 2013 a toddler has been cured of a rare condition after having his skull broken apart and pieced back together like a jigsaw			1
@entity5 , two , from @entity6 , @entity7 , was born with craniosynostosis - a condition which caused the skull to fuse before birth			1
while most babies are born with gaps in the skull which allow the brain to grow , @entity5 ’s had already fused by the time he was born			1
@entity5 ( pictured with his mother , @entity16 ) , two , was born with craniosynostosis - a condition which causes the skull to fuse early			1
without treatment , he could have developed learning difficulties and sight problems the toddler underwent five hours of surgery - during which he lost all the blood in his body - to reshape his skull and piece it back together			1
luckily , the gruelling operation was a success , and his parents have now been told that @entity5 will need no further surgery			1
his mother , @entity16 , 24 , said : ‘ when i realised that @entity5 ’s skull would be broken apart and then pieced back together , i was shocked			1
‘ it was described to me as though his skull was like a jigsaw puzzle			2
‘ then when he had the surgery and we were told that he ’d lost so much blood from his head that he ’d had a full body blood transfusion , i was horrified			1
‘ it was heart breaking to think what he ’d been through			0
@entity5 had a five hour operation at @entity45 's @entity44 during which surgeons broke his skull and then pieced it back together like a jigsaw @entity5 ( pictured after surgery ) lost all of the blood in his body during his operation and had to have numerous transfusions			1
however , the surgery was a success and he is now recovering at home ‘ but with his skull fused together , his brain would n’t have been able to grow and he could have ended up with eye sight , speech or mobility problems			1
‘ he ’s been left with a big zigzag scar across his scalp , but that ’s slowly being hidden with a full head of blonde hair			0
he ’s doing really well			0
’ whilst ms @entity68 , a support worker for adults with learning disabilities , never noticed a problem with her youngest child , a doctor pointed out his odd shaped head when @entity5 was just four - weeks - old			1
ms @entity68 said : ‘ when the doctor mentioned his head shape i was a bit surprised			0
@entity5 's mother , @entity16 , said : ' when i realised that @entity5 's skull would be broken apart and then pieced back together , i was shocked			1
' @entity5 is pictured two days after the surgery @entity5 ( pictured before surgery ) had such a minor deformation of the skull when he was diagnosed that his mother did not notice it - it was picked up by a doctor ‘ i supposed i had noticed it but i never thought anything of it			1
‘ then about two weeks later he started having eye sight problems - i could n’t get him to focus at all , it was as though he was looking right through me			1
‘ the doctor arranged for us to have an emergency referral and that ’s when i really started to worry			0
’ at three - months - old @entity5 was officially diagnosed with craniosynostosis			1
his mother said : ‘ i did n’t know what it was and i ’d never heard of it before			0
ms @entity68 ( pictured with @entity5 and his sister , @entity102 ) said : ' he 's been left with a big zigzag scar across his scalp , but that 's slowly being hidden with a full head of blonde hair			2
he 's doing really well ' @entity5 ( pictured in hospital after his surgery ) is not expected to need any further surgery ‘ naturally i went online and i just scared myself			2
‘ i read all these horror stories , and from then on i was just a mess			0
‘ the thought of losing my little boy was just too awful to even think about			0
’ @entity5 underwent his five hour surgery at @entity44 , in @entity45 , at just over a year old			1
ms @entity68 said : ‘ his @entity116 had to go with him when he was put under because i just could n’t bear it			2
ms @entity68 said : ' i 'm so proud of @entity5 for being so brave and getting through everything			2
he 's a strong little boy and i feel so lucky that he 's happy and healthy now ' ‘ he was my precious little boy and i knew i would n’t be able to face seeing him slip away			0
‘ the five hours of waiting were a nightmare , and when he finally did come around we were told how poorly he ’d been during the op. ‘ i rushed to see him in the high dependency unit and just burst into tears			0
‘ seeing his scar was quite a shock , it really brought home what he ’d been through			2
@entity132 is a rare problem with the skull that causes a baby to be born with , or to develop , an abnormally shaped head			1
this can cause headaches , learning difficulties and eye problems			1
these symptoms usually result from increased pressure within the skull			2
the problem occurs as a result of the premature fusion of the different sections of the skull			2
this means the skull is unable to grow in certain areas and when one area is prevented from growing , other areas may ' overgrow ' to compensate			0
@entity132 affects about one in every 1,800 to 3,000 children			0
three quarters of cases are in boys			0
the main treatment for the condition is surgery - most children recover well after the surgery and have no further problems but some develop other problems with their skull 's development as they get older			1
this can require further surgery to correct			0
source : @entity172 ‘ it was a few hours before i could give him a cuddle but when i did it was amazing			0
’ now @entity5 is back home with his mother and sister , @entity102 , four			1
ms @entity68 said : ‘ i ’m so proud of @entity5 for being so brave and getting through everything			2
‘ he ’s a strong little boy and i feel so lucky that he ’s happy and healthy now			0
‘ seeing him play with his sister with a big smile on his face is just incredible			0
’ @entity185 , the group administrator for headlines , the craniofacial support group said : ‘ @entity132 is the premature fusion of the skull before birth , either in one place or in multiple places			0
‘ normally when a child is born the brain is made of individual plates			0
if the plates have prematurely fused , the brain can not grow			0
‘ the child could have brain damage , and pressure on the brain if left untreated			0
‘ in the @entity200 there are four specialist units at @entity202 in @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity44 in @entity45 , and @entity205 , who specialise in the treatment of craniosynostosis			1
‘ for children with single suture craniosynostosis , the child is usually given surgery at around a year old			2
‘ if this surgery is successful the child will normally face no further problems			2
