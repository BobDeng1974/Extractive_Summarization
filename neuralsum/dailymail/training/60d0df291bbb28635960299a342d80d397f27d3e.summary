in first person pieces for @entity13 - which have recently come to light - the pair , who write under the pseudonyms @entity17 and @entity18 , reveal how they even considered aborting one of the fetuses but decided it was ' too machiavellian '			1
instead they followed through with the pregnancy and , in the run up to the birth of their boys this august , they said they felt like ' cancer patients with only months to live ' , not expectant parents			1
double trouble : a couple who underwent @entity3 treatment with the hope of having a girl , have told of their ' anger ' and ' disappointment ' when they found out they were expecting twin boys ' my wife and i even both privately admitted that we do n’t like the new children , which is of course insane , ' mr @entity40 wrote			1
the couple 's musings sparked a furious backlash , with many readers deeming them ' ungrateful ' , ' selfish ' and ' irresponsible '			1
up , ' one commenter wrote			1
and another added : ' part of me actually hopes you just wrote this for attention and you are making this whole thing up			1
' i ’d like to think that no one is really this dishearten over their own " thought out " decisions			1
' ' my wife and i both privately admitted that we do n't like the new children ' the @entity64 , who already have a young son , said they had been trying to provide him with a sister for nearly two years , which left them ' exhausted ' and ' depressed '			1
as a last ditch effort they tried artificial insemination - a fertility treatment which places washed sperm directly into the uterus - but with no success			1
they then turned to in vitro fertilization and were surprised to discover that it worked first time			2
however , their surprise turned to horror as the doctor revealed they had ' two strong embryos			2
' controversial : the couple 's musings sparked a furious backlash under fire : many readers deemed the couple ' ungrateful ' , ' selfish ' and ' irresponsible ' mr @entity40 said that they felt ' pissed ' , ' terrified ' , ' angry ' , ' guilty ' , and ‘ regretful ’ at the news			1
' [ it was me ] and my wife ’s nightmare , ' he added			2
while mrs @entity18 recalled : ' we were pregnant with twins - twin boys , we ’d find out later			2
in my mind i had done nothing less than ruin our family			2
' ' we brought this on ourselves			2
this is what we wanted - now it 's our worst nightmare ' she then bemoaned the physical effects of twin pregnancy			2
' [ it ] has slowed me down and i ca n’t care for my son the way i used to			0
' i feel like s * * * pretty much all of the time physically			0
i ca n’t get on the floor , i ca n’t bend over , i ca n’t pick him up , i ca n’t run after him			0
' during my first singleton pregnancy i was working out , working full time , taking a class at night , and keeping up with many of the household responsibilities			0
' in the lab : in vitro fertilisation ( @entity3 ) is a process by which an egg is fertilized by sperm outside the body and implanted in the woman 's uterus despite the @entity64 ' articles triggering a torrent of criticism there was a small majority who seemed to sympathize with how the expectant parents were feeling			1
one father wrote on @entity135 : ' my wife and i are in the @entity138 same position right now ( she 's on bed rest and due in a couple months )			1
' could n't get pregnant , tried @entity140 's , had miscarriages , transferred two embryos since the odds were low and			0
then @entity145 , both embryos ' stuck			0
' what the ? ? ? ' this whole process has torn us apart			0
i 'm ecstatic to be having twins , she 's terrified and wishes things had worked out differently			0
so i understand this couple 's mixed feelings			1
' and a mother - of - twins offered some words of encouragement : ' you will make it work and you will love these children			0
' i promise you if you pull through the first year together as a team you will be the strongest kind of family there can be , and nothing can stop you from there ! ' mrs @entity18 however , says that she does n't want to read any message boards telling her how joyful twins are			0
' none of this makes me feel any better			0
quite frankly , it just pisses me off , ' she concludes			0
