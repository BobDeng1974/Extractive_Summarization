once @entity45 ’s biggest mortgage provider , @entity9 was rescued by @entity46 in september 2008 after a reckless lending spree that lasted for most of the last decade			1

lord @entity4 repeatedly rejected suggestions from the banking commission ’s chairman that the loans were ‘ incompetent ’			1
he said : ‘ there was a lot of mistaken lending			1
i was n’t there in the trenches with the people making the decisions – i was only there at the most part - time			1
’ he then conceded that the bank ’s top brass ‘ missed a trick ’ in its corporate lending division			1

the @entity75 mp added : ‘ millions have lost out on what they thought they ’d get for their pensions			2

toxic loans on @entity9 's books crippled @entity46 , pictured , which rescued @entity9 in 2008 , triggering a £ 20billion bailout from taxpayers mr @entity69 brandished a letter @entity4 wrote to the @entity89 in january 2008 , a few months before @entity9 was swallowed up by @entity46			1
in it he had written : ‘ i can understand a mindset which regards a “ non executive chairman ” as sailing above the battle , not concerned with the detailed day - to - day realities			0
can i make it plain that i do not regard myself as that kind of chairman			0
‘ i am legally responsible for the business and with the modesty for which i am not famous regard myself as being knowledgeable and well briefed			1
’ lord @entity4 had close links to the new @entity35 government and is a friend of former spin chief @entity37 , pictured yesterday he insisted his biggest mistake was failing to anticipate the credit crunch , when banks were starved of funds because they had become nervous about lending to each other			1
but @entity40 , chancellor to @entity111 and father of tv chef @entity113 , said : ‘ you are living in cloud cuckoo land			1
you were responsible for a strategy of reckless growth and that is what led you into difficulties			1
‘ when the details seem to suit your defence they appear to miraculously pop back into your memory			0
’ lord @entity4 ’s lack of contrition angered @entity127 , the archbishop of @entity128 - elect			1
he said he was ‘ baffled ’ by the inability to recognise the ‘ complete failure of culture and strategy ’ which ‘ led to a bank being wiped out ’			0
referring to @entity4 ’s insistence on blaming the credit crunch for the collapse of @entity9 , the church leader said : ‘ it is like someone who has a fatal heart attack at home and is in a car crash on the way to hospital			1
and the car crash is then blamed as the cause of death			0
’ lord @entity4 responded : ‘ we were not aware until late in 2008 that we were suffering from a heart attack			1
’ the showdown came the day after former @entity9 chief executive sir @entity151 apologised for the first time for the collapse and said he was ‘ horrified ’ by the misery inflicted on taxpayers and ex-colleagues			2
but he sparked further controversy by admitting he had sold two - thirds of his shares in the two years before the financial crisis			0
lord @entity4 ’s apology came only at the end of his long testimony			1
he said : ‘ i am extremely sorry it happened			0
i am extremely sorry that employees got hit , taxpayers got hit and shareholders got hit			0
there are few days when i do n’t think about this			0
’ taxpayers are sitting on a £ 7.5billion paper loss on the @entity46 shares bought by the government			0
meanwhile millions of investors and pension savers have seen their nest eggs destroyed			0
@entity46 has been forced to write off almost £ 50billion in bad loans made by @entity9 – twice as much as any other bank , including @entity177			0
this includes £ 26billion in risky loans to businesses and property entrepreneurs made by the bank ’s corporate lending division			2
@entity184 , who ran the operation , remains the only @entity9 executive to be punished			0

' upset ' : sir @entity151 sold off two - thirds of his shares before the lender followed the man who ran @entity9 sold off two - thirds of his shares before the lender folded			0

@entity69 , the @entity75 mp who chairs the commission , told him : ‘ you managed to get out before the crash – you sold two - thirds of your shares ’			0
sir @entity0 , chief executive from 2001 to 2006 , replied : ‘ in effect yes – but not knowingly			0
i was essentially balancing my portfolio of assets			0
’ mr @entity69 countered : ‘ you sold two - thirds of your holdings at a time when messages were getting increasingly strident about the company you just left ... you were busy bailing out of it			2
’ the disgraced banker , who went on to become deputy chairman of the @entity189 watchdog , also faced calls to give up his knighthood as he admitted ‘ incompetent lending ’ led to the collapse of @entity9			1
forced to account for his actions for the first time on monday , he told the parliamentary commission on banking standards he was ‘ horrified ’ by what happened to colleagues and taxpayers			2
asked what he was apologising for , he responded : ‘ i ’m apologising for the fact that i played a major part in building a business that failed			1
