in a world of instant communication , where you can easily find dates online and share intimate pictures in seconds , barely a day goes by without someone being ' caught out ' with an illicit image to the wrong person			2
just this week we 've seen @entity10 's ( now ex ) man @entity11 accused of sending inappropriate messages to an ex and @entity15 mp @entity14 was forced to resign from his post as @entity17 after he sent pictures of himself in paisley pyjamas to a reporter posing as a woman on what 's @entity23 is sexting cheating ? @entity10 dumped fianc√© @entity11 over his alleged texts to ex-girlfriend it 's hardly the first time a celebrity has been involved in such scandal			1
in 2010 , @entity31 hit the headlines after he was accused of sending x-rated texts to glamour model @entity34 , but his wife @entity35 decided to stand by him			1
in the same year , the comedian @entity36 stepped down from his presenting role at @entity38 when he was caught out exchanging sexy @entity40 messages with a female fan - he and his wife have since split			1
but what are the guidelines on sexting ? is it cheating if you do n't make physical contact ? the subject has fired up debate with this morning 's @entity52 believing that sending suggestive messages to another person while in a relationship should always be avoided			1
speaking on the @entity58 show today , she said : ' adultery is not necessarily the end of a relationship , neither is sexting			2
' is it a good idea though ? no it is not			0
' i am on the end of receiving letters , and i get them in droves , it seems to be a compulsion			0
@entity14 has resigned as @entity17 after he sent pictures of himself in pyjamas to an undercover reporter ' now you can play out your fantasy on the internet , but it 's not just a fantasy			1
' partners feel that something that should be intimate has been shared with someone else			0
' i remember talking to a man who had been caught in flagrante on the internet and he said to me in injured tones that he was only mucking about - it 's this schoolboy and schoolgirl idea that it is only mucking about , but it is n't			2
' @entity36 was caught out exchanging sexy @entity40 messages with a female fan in 2010 however , it 's easy to see how both women and men can get confused , because while for many sexting is a clear violation of a relationship , for others it is just a bit of harmless fun			1
journalist @entity101 who was also speaking on today 's @entity103 episode believes that people should n't be punished for a few suggestive messages if their partner finds out			1
she said : ' i think there is a threshold here that has n't been crossed , i do n't think it is anywhere near as bad			0
' @entity113 ( @entity14 ) should n't be punished			2
' had he crossed the line and something had gone on , then yes , he should be punished			0
' but we should n't put digital cheating on a par with actual cheating			2
it 's not ideal , but is it the end of a relationship ? no. ' i think everybody does it or has done it at some point			0
' he may have done that , taken a step back and realised he had gone too far			0
' what about things like emoticons and writing ' xxx ' , where do we stop if we call this adultery ? if we 're saying that this is digital cheating			2
' finding some middle ground , @entity136 and @entity138 columnist @entity137 believes that all couples need to clearly define where their lines in the sand are before a relationship gets serious			1
that way both parties know if they are doing something wrong			0
she said : ' everyone has their own definition of what constitutes cheating - which is why you need to spell out , specifically , what counts as infidelity for you when you 're in a monogamous relationship			0
in 2010 , @entity31 sent racy texts to glamour model @entity34 while still married to his wife @entity35 ( left ) ' i always tell people , ask yourself this ' what would my partner think , if they could see me right now ? ' , doing whatever it is they 're doing			1
' if their partner would n't like it , consider it cheating			0
' even though there 's no physical contact , sexting is still sharing intimate , sexual words or images with someone other than your partner			0
' so yes , it is cheating , though i think most of us would prefer it to cheating in person - though neither are ideal ! ' watch @entity182 and @entity101 debate sexting on @entity183			1
