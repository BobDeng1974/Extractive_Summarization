we 've long known that a lack of sleep makes us feel irritable and crave carbohydrates , not to mention make our skin look dull			2
now scientists say that just one week of poor sleep can disrupt hundreds of genes , increasing the risk of a host of life - threatening illnesses linked to stress , immunity and inflammation			1
the discovery could explain why lack of sleep is so bad for the health , they say			2
sleep deficiency is associated with a host of conditions including obesity , heart disease and mental impairment for the new study , researchers examined gene activity in 26 sleep - deprived volunteers			1
they found that insufficient sleep had an impact on more than 700 genes			1
some had their activity dampened , while others became extra-active			0
those affected included genes associated with the ‘ body clock ’ cycle , metabolism , and immune and stress responses			1
the scientists were led by sleep expert @entity42 - @entity41 , from the @entity43 , who described sleep as a ‘ pillar of health ’ - just like diet and exercise			0
the researchers wrote in the journal @entity52 : ‘ insufficient sleep is increasingly recognised as contributing to a wide range of health problems			0
' multiple studies have shown self - reported short sleep duration - defined in most studies as less than six hours - is associated with negative health outcomes such as all - cause mortality , obesity , diabetes , cardiovascular disease and impaired vigilance and cognition			1
' indeed , sleep deficiency is associated with a host of conditions including obesity , heart disease and mental impairment			1
sleep expert @entity42 - @entity41 described sleep as a ' pillar of health ' - just like diet and exercise prof @entity41 ’s team analysed @entity77 - the messenger chemical that delivers coded ‘ instructions ’ from the genes to cells - in the blood of volunteers			2
@entity77 can be used as a tool to measure gene activity			0
participants were exposed to a week of poor sleep during which they slept no more than six hours a night			1
at the end of this time , they had to stay awake for around 40 hours while @entity77 samples were collected at three hourly intervals			0
the results were compared with the effect on the same volunteers of sleeping up to 10 hours a night for a week			2
again , @entity77 samples were taken during a long period of wakefulness at the end of the study period			0
during the ‘ sleep - restriction condition ’ volunteers got an average of 5.70 hours sleep a night			1
the scientists noted : ‘ @entity102 obtained in the sleep - restriction condition was not sufficient to maintain alertness or performance			0
’ the findings may be relevant to many people living in industrialised societies , they said			0
for many thousands of @entity110 sleeplessness is a grinding fact of life - one in eight sleeps for less than six hours a night and more than a third suffer from insomnia at some time			1
the news comes just after scientists in @entity117 discovered that children who get a good night ’s sleep have a boosted memory			2
the researchers at the @entity122 , @entity117 , found that during deep sleep children have slower wave activity in their brains and that this is critical to the ability to learn , think and remember			0
therefore , if sleep is disrupted , their ability to remember things they have learned will be affected .			0

poor sleep can impact 700 different genes
it is linked to stress , obesity and heart disease
one in eight @entity110 sleep fewer than six hours a night
