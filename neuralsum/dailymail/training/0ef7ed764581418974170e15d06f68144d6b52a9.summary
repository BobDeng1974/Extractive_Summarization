' and at the same time , we are looking now at armed response , we ’ve done quite a lot of practises in this country for situations where people have guns and there marauding around town centres			0
' in a @entity30 statement yesterday afternoon , home secretary @entity22 told @entity6 that innocent lives were being put ' at risk ' by a failure to give the security services the powers they need to prevent a terrorist attack			1

police and security agencies ' regularly ' carry out training exercises to test their response to a terror attack , including scenarios similar to the incidents in @entity52 , @entity134 said			1
' the meeting agreed that for future exercises , the relevant agencies should identify whether there are any further specific elements of the @entity52 attack that should be built into the exercise scenarios			0
