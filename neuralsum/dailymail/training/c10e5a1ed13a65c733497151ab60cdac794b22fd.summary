@entity5 scored the winner at @entity26 , courtesy of another @entity29 mistake			2
but @entity0 boss @entity6 later branded @entity1 striker @entity7 an ‘ acrobatic ’ diver over the @entity32 ’s two alleged attempts to con referee @entity12 after challenges in the penalty area			1
i ’m not @entity48 but i feel i have a responsibility in defending some values in this football			0
‘ one of the good things we have is we do n’t like simulation			0
‘ this situation in the box , with @entity41 and @entity5 , stop this or give @entity7 a yellow card			1
it ’s not good for our game			0
unimpressed : @entity0 manager @entity6 believes @entity7 deserved to be booked for his theatrics at @entity26 light - hearted ? @entity6 and @entity1 's @entity7 share a joke before the second - half begins acrobatic : @entity6 accused @entity7 of performing a ' swimming pool jump ' after his side 's 2 - 1 victory ‘ @entity5 comes in and it looks like somebody shot him ( @entity7 ) in the back			1
for me that is a clear yellow card			0
‘ he ’s doing an acrobatic swimming - pool jump to try to get the penalty because he ’s so clever he knows he ’s in the penalty area with the @entity1 supporters behind			2
‘ if a @entity0 player did that , i ’d tell them not to do it			2
’ quiet word : referee @entity12 speaks to @entity7 but did not book the @entity32 for simulation going down : @entity7 hits the ground after a tangle with @entity0 defender @entity84 @entity14 , who has a close friendship with @entity6 , hit back by insisting @entity5 should have been sent off for a late challenge on @entity16 after three minutes			1
he said : ‘ that was a wild shank where he ’s come down his knee and shin and he did n’t even get a yellow card			0
‘ that ’s the first wild challenge			0
the second one , @entity7 will always provoke a challenge in the box			2
that could have been a penalty on another day			0
’ mutual respect : @entity1 boss @entity14 ( left ) previously worked under @entity6 studs up : @entity14 believes @entity0 striker @entity5 should 've seen red for this dangerous tackle on midfielder @entity98 impact : after getting away with his tackle on @entity16 , @entity5 went on to score the winning goal for @entity0			1
