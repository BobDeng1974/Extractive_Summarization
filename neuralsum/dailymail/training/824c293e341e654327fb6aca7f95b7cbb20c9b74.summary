if only there was space for anything else			2
for wherever there is a nook or cranny , it is occupied by an ornament			0
there ’s enough blue delft china to start a pottery shop and not one wall remains unadorned			0
save for a few square inches of kitchen worktop ( not counting the toilet lid and cistern ) barely a single flat surface is visible			0
take a seat ( if you can ) : plumped up cushions , lamps and trinkets fill the lounge of the @entity7 family 's six - bedroom home there 's enough blue delft china to start a pottery shop and not one wall remains unadorned			1
save for a few square inches of sofa and carpet - matching of course in the 13 months the immaculately kept house has been on the market , it has n't been to anyone else 's tastes			1
meanwhile the semi has become the subject of an internet snob-fest , with critics from @entity51 to @entity52 offering unkind opinions minimalist is a word unlikely to have been used much in this house			2
even the modest size bathroom boasts a chandelier			1
nor is there any escape in the garden , awash with ornaments , statues and ironwork			1
naturally , it is all a question of personal taste			0
alas , in the 13 months the immaculately kept house has been on the market , it has n’t been to anyone else ’s			1
it is , as estate agents tend to say , still waiting for the right buyer			0
meanwhile the otherwise anonymous semi has become the subject of an internet snob-fest , with critics from @entity51 to @entity52 offering unkind opinions on the décor as the @entity80 property website details clock up thousands of hits and go viral			0
yesterday the downsizing family trying to sell the house answered the doorbell ( the chimes play @entity87 ) but declined to comment on the home ’s unlikely celebrity status			2
it is understood they are baffled by the interest , and reportedly offended by some of the less polite criticism online			0
one @entity96 contributor suggested having a £ 1 - a - head whip - round to buy it as a competition prize			2
another said that simply to look at the pictures ‘ gives me a panic attack ’			0
on @entity52 , ‘ call in the @entity109 ! ’ was one de-cluttering suggestion ; another speculated over whether the three dogs in front of the fireplace were stuffed			0
the house has been owned by 56 - year - old @entity7 and her second husband @entity111 since 1986			1
her distinctive taste in furnishings formed the backdrop for bringing up three children by her first marriage , as well as five children with 58 - year - old mr @entity118 in october last year it was on the market for just under £ 350,000 but the price has since been cut by £ 50,000 and is now marked as a ' premium listing ' on the plus side , however , many declared admiration for whoever does the dusting at 45 @entity127 , a leafy street in @entity128 , on the outskirts of @entity130			1

yesterday the downsizing family trying to sell the house answered the doorbell ( the chimes play @entity87 ) but declined to comment on the home 's unlikely celebrity status despite some less than kind comments about the chintzy decor , cascading silk blooms and mountains of plump satin cushions - some on social networks have praised whoever ' does the dusting ' in the immaculately kept house in a textbook piece of estate agent blurb , the details give not a hint of the décor , leaving the photographs , perhaps , to speak for themselves nor is there any escape from the clutter in the garden , awash with ornaments , statues and ironwork ' they love their home but it 's too big for them now , ' a neighbour confided yesterday			1
' they do n't see what all the fuss is about			0
it 's the house they 're selling , not the ornaments ' in a textbook piece of estate agent blurb , the details give not a hint of the décor , leaving the photographs , perhaps , to speak for themselves			2
