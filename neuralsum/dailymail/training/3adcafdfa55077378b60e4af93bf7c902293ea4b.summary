by @entity0 she has played on the @entity2 and @entity4 soundtracks and performed with stars such as @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8			0
but classical musician @entity9 struggled to keep in time with loan repayments on her £ 400,000 antique viola – and is now facing a legal battle to keep it			1
the 57 - year - old , married to renowned conductor @entity14 , 68 , is fighting in the @entity15 to prevent her beloved 211 - year - old instrument being sold by her creditors			1
court fight : @entity9 , 57 , from @entity20 , @entity19 is battling in @entity15 to keep her 211 - year - old instrument the loans were taken out after the couple were hit with a £ 185,000 legal bill for a separate case in 2007			1
they lost a row over an unpaid builder ’s bill of £ 16,000 on their £ 3million seven - bedroom home in @entity20 , @entity19			2
mrs @entity9 used the viola as ‘ security ’ , it is claimed , to raise a series of cash loans totalling £ 280,000			1
instrument dealers @entity35 and @entity37 along with pawnbroking company @entity38 , who provided the loans between them , claim the necessary repayments have not been made			0
they are asking the @entity15 to order that the viola be sold and the proceeds split between them to cover the debts which , with interest , are now said to exceed £ 500,000			1
the @entity48 claim that technicalities to do with the loan agreements mean they can not be enforced by forfeiting the viola , which was made by feted @entity53 craftsman @entity52 in 1803 – and which they are desperate to save			2
prized : a viola like mrs @entity9 's yesterday the court heard that mrs @entity9 first approached mr @entity57 , a dealer in fine stringed instruments who lives in @entity61 , @entity62 , after a service at his local church			1
mr @entity57 ’s barrister @entity65 , said the dealer agreed to lend mrs @entity9 £ 100,000 in february 2010			1
mr @entity65 added that both mr @entity57 and mrs @entity9 had signed a document detailing the ‘ loan agreement and security by way of a mortgage over the viola ’			1
the terms of the loan were £ 100,000 , to be borrowed for 12 months , at a monthly interest rate of 2.5 per cent , the barrister said			2
ten monthly interest payments of £ 2,500 were made ‘ then nothing else … none of the capital has ever been repaid ’ the court heard			2
mrs @entity9 also borrowed £ 50,000 from mr @entity37			1
mr @entity14 , a former member of the @entity82 and previously professor at the @entity84 , argued that the loans made to his wife by the two instrument dealers did not comply with rules laid down in the 1974 @entity89 to control money - lending			0
therefore , he claimed , the loans could not be enforced by forfeiting the viola			0
he and his wife are also contesting the validity of @entity94 ’s security over the instrument – for a £ 130,000 loan			2
the @entity97 argued that the viola is worth more than the £ 230,000 which would be raised should the judge order it to be sold			0
mr @entity65 told the judge : ‘ mrs @entity9 seeks declarations to the effect that the loan transactions between herself and mr @entity57 and mr @entity37 are unenforceable			1
‘ it is claimed by @entity108 that mr @entity57 can not enforce the agreement because he needed a credit licence			0
her husband makes it clear that she [ also ] intends to contest the validity of @entity94 ’s security , ’ the barrister added			0
‘ there can be no doubt that mr @entity57 lent £ 100,000 to mrs @entity9 , none of which she has repaid			1
’ mr @entity57 denied that he needed such a licence to recover his money , and told the judge : ‘ i am not a money - lender			0
’ he added that the loan was ‘ very much a one - off transaction ’			0
mrs @entity9 did not attend court yesterday			2
her husband is part of a 500 - year - old musical dynasty , with a family tree linking him to six talented @entity53 brothers brought to @entity129 by @entity130 to entertain the @entity131			1
outside the hearing mr @entity57 said of the contested instrument , which is currently being held by an auctioneer : ‘ it ’s a nice viola – it ’s a rarity			0
‘ whoever buys it will probably sell it for about £ 400,000			0
’ the hearing continues .			0
