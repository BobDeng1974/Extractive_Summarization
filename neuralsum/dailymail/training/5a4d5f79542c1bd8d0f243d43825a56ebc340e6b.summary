by @entity0 scientists believe that regular injections of young blood could help keep us youthful in both mind and body it sounds like a barely believable plot in a dracula - inspired novel			1
but scientists believe that regular injections of young blood could help keep us youthful in both mind and body			1
studies reveal that a chemical found in young blood can boost brains and strengthen withered muscles			1
the discovery could even help those already suffering from diseases such as @entity22 ’s , with hopes that tests on patients could start later this year			1
and it may also be possible to create a pill to avoid the need for injections for the squeamish			2
professor @entity29 , an expert in regenerative medicine from @entity31 , spoke of the potential benefits			0
‘ @entity34 ’s power to grow stronger by drinking blood would be trivial compared to the impact of a drug discovered in blood that produced true brain rejuvenation for all , ’ he said			1
the excitement surrounds three experiments from the @entity42 , which some may find ghoulish			0
in one , pairs of older and younger mice were studied after their blood vessels were connected to allow flow from one to the other			1
the scientists also gave the older animals regular jabs of young blood			1
the study found that the youthful blood boosted the number of connections between cells in the brain ’s memory hub and made them stronger			1
from @entity34 , who as a vampire , had to drink virgin blood to survive , to blood - swilling mothers today , there has long been a fascination with the restorative powers of blood			2
in 1492 , pope @entity67 is said to have received , at the behest of a @entity70 physician , a transfusion of the blood of three ten year old boys			2
all of them , including the @entity67 , died			0
@entity75 , 45 , from @entity76 , @entity77 , has been drinking live human blood from willing donors for the past 30 years			2
the care worker , who says she is hooked on the practice , consumes around half - a - gallon of blood per month and believes that it keeps her feeling young and vigorous			2
ms @entity75 says she finds her ' donors ' - fellow vampire fans willing to let her drink from them - at her local occult and oddities store			0
' i feel more beautiful than any other time when i 'm regularly drinking blood ' , she says			2
a fading sense of smell was also sharpened , said researchers in @entity96			0
meanwhile , the older mice did as well as younger animals in tests in which they had to remember how to navigate out of a ‘ swimming pool ’ , the journal @entity98 reported			0
researcher @entity104 said : ‘ it ’s as if the old brains were recharged by young blood			1
’ he hopes to test the treatment on @entity22 ’s patients in a matter of months			1
co-researcher @entity111 added : ‘ we ’ve shown that at least some age - related impairments on brain function are reversible			0
‘ they ’re not final			0
’ he said that it might be possible to use young blood to keep the brain healthy into old age			1
in addition , said mr @entity111 , the rejuvenating effect could also help those who have already developed diseases like @entity22 ’s			1
in a second study published in the journal @entity129 , researchers from @entity126 used young blood to boost the strength of ageing mice by up to half			1
endurance was also improved and a protein called @entity136 was found to be key			0
the third piece of research , also from @entity126 , pointed to @entity136 helping to sharpen smell			0
this suggests it may be possible to encapsulate the benefits of young blood in a pill , rather than needing regular injections			1
the excitement surrounds three experiments from the @entity42 , which some may find ghoulish			0
in one , pairs of older and younger mice were studied after their blood vessels were connected to allow flow from one to the other professor @entity29 said : ‘ the @entity34 fantasy of drinking blood to regenerate is so last century compared to the reality of the scientific breakthroughs in regenerative medicine			2
‘ if , and it ’s a big if , @entity136 goes on to achieve real rejuvenation in humans , this will start to hammer a stake through the heart of the ageing process			0
’ @entity166 said the studies were interesting but urged caution			0
director of research , dr @entity169 , said : ‘ these studies are of unknown significance to humans			0
‘ this research does not investigate the type of cognitive impairment seen in alzheimer ’s disease , which is not an inevitable consequence of ageing			0
‘ @entity22 is the most common cause of dementia and we urgently need treatments capable of stopping the disease in its tracks			2

scientists say regular injections of young blood ' could help keep us youthful '
@entity190 could help those suffering from diseases such as @entity22 ’s
trial on mice set to be tested on @entity22 ’s patients in a matter of months
