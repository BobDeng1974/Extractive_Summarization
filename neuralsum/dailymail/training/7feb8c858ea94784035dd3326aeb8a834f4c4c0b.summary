by @entity0 @entity2 wine consumption can prevent the development of kidney disease many people feel a little guilty as they sip their wine of an evening			1
but now , new research suggests the odd glass could actually be good for the health			0
@entity2 wine consumption could help keep the kidneys healthy and may protect the hearts of people who already have kidney disease			1
researchers at the @entity15 found that people who drink less than one glass of wine a day have a 37 per cent lower prevalence of chronic kidney disease than those who drink no wine at all			1
and , people who have chronic kidney disease are 29 per cent less likely to also have heart disease if they drink a small amount of wine			2
the researchers , led by dr @entity27 , used 2003 to 2006 data from the @entity29 on 5,852 individuals , 1,031 of whom had chronic kidney disease			2
@entity36 , director of scientific activities at the @entity37 , said : ‘ similar to previous studies showing that moderate wine consumption appears to impart some health benefit by lowering the risk of heart disease and diabetes , this study suggests an association between moderate wine consumption ( less than one glass per day ) and lower rates of chronic kidney disease			1
’ moderation is the key for kidney patients when it comes to alcohol consumption , with a few caveats , he added			0
‘ excess alcohol consumption has definitely been shown to have negative effects on kidney function			0
‘ alcohol can also worsen hypertension , a major cause of chronic kidney disease , so those with poorly controlled hypertension should definitely limit the amount of alcohol they consume			2
‘ it 's also important to consider the nutritional contents of the various alcoholic drinks to be sure they comply with the prescribed renal diet			0
’ in people with chronic kidney disease , moderate wine consumption can reduce the risk of heart disease the researchers are not sure exactly why wine is linked to good kidney health			1
dr @entity27 says it could be because moderate drinking is linked to lower levels of protein in the urine and that those with kidney problems tend to have higher urine protein levels			0
and while he can not be sure , dr @entity27 says it is possible red wine is more protective against heart and kidney problems than white wine is .			0
