for any student , the pressure of university finals is bad enough - but for @entity4 , 22 , the stress was exacerbated by having to rush to the loo up to 20 times a day as she suffered a flare - up of her @entity10 's disease			1
' i could n't do anything or plan anything because i needed to be close to a loo all the time			0
which , as well as being hugely inconvenient and unpleasant , is also horribly embarrassing , ' she recalls			0
' i left my student flat and went home to my mum 's house to lock myself away until the attack had died down			2
' @entity10 's is an autoimmune condition affecting the bowel that is caused when the immune system triggers the release of a protein , tumour necrosis factor - alpha , which kills the ' good bacteria ' in the gut			1
sufferer @entity36 ( pictured ) recently highlighted the issue by proudly posing with her colostomy bag mrs @entity36 still suffers with @entity10 's disease and hopes for a cure			1
since getting the colostomy bags ( pictured ) she has had a stem cell transplant but caught @entity43 , which almost killed her support : @entity45 , pictured , said she has had an ' ileostomy bag for years now ' this leads to inflammation and , in turn , diarrhoea , stomach pain , weight loss - because of poor digestion of food - and extreme tiredness			1
around 115,000 people in the @entity56 have @entity10 's , with most diagnosed between their mid-teens and late 20s			1
but new figures suggest that its incidence is rising dramatically - there has been a 300 per cent increase in the number of 16 to 29 - year - olds receiving treatment in @entity35 for @entity10 's in the past ten years , according to the @entity65			1
@entity10 's is a chronic , often debilitating condition and many patients end up needing surgery to remove part of their bowel			1
last week , the @entity72 reported on @entity10 's sufferer @entity73 , who became an internet sensation by posting a photograph of herself in a bikini , exposing the colostomy bags she has to wear because of the condition			1
@entity83 , 23 , a make - up artist who was diagnosed when she was three , said she posted the picture to help others in her position feel more comfortable in their own skin			2
so why are more and more young people like @entity83 and @entity4 succumbing to @entity10 's disease ? in the sun : @entity92 shared this selfie in a message of support for a fellow sufferer the condition has a strong genetic link - ' a person with a first - degree relative , such as a parent , with @entity10 's has a one in ten chance of developing it , ' says @entity104 , professor of medicine at @entity106			1
it may be that a genetic predisposition is exacerbated by poor diet , suggests dr @entity110 , a consultant gastroenterologist at @entity111 in @entity112			2
' if you have a lot of junk food it makes it more likely that you will develop @entity10 's			1
' @entity10 's is a chronic , often debilitating condition and many patients end up needing surgery			1
file picture certain foods could make the gut ' go into overdrive ' , causing inflammation as it tries to process them , says @entity128 , a consultant colorectal surgeon at @entity129 , @entity130			0
' it could be that certain foods cause a change in the types of bugs living in the gut - we 're only speculating , but this may well be processed foods			2
' ironically , many @entity10 's sufferers prefer sweet , processed foods because these are less likely to cause diarrhoea than high - fibre foods such as bran cereals			1
but diet alone ca n't be to blame , as many patients who develop @entity10 's eat healthily			1
another potential trigger is smoking , which can double the risk by reducing blood supply to the gut			0
one theory is that it is linked to the over-prescription of antibiotics , particularly in childhood and the teenage years , which may kill off ' good ' gut bacteria			2
@entity10 's disease is a condition that causes inflammation of the digestive system			1
inflammation is the body 's reaction to injury or irritation and can cause redness , swelling and pain			2
@entity10 's disease is one of the two main forms of @entity169 ( @entity169 )			1
the other common form of @entity169 is @entity171			0
@entity10 's is described as chronic , meaning it is a life - long condition			1
sufferers will have periods of good health , remission , as well as times when their symptoms flare up or relapse			0
there is currently no cure for the disease , but drugs and surgery can give patients long periods of relief from their symptoms			0
the cause of @entity10 's disease is not well understood			1
experts believe the condition is , in part , inherited , while an abnormal reaction of the immune system to certain bacteria in the intestines is thought to contribute			0
viruses , bacteria , diet , smoking and stress have all been suggested as environmental triggers , but there is no definitive evidence that any one of these is a cause of @entity10 's			1
@entity10 's causes ulcers to form in the gut and inflammation that affects the body 's ability to digest food , absorb nutrients and eliminate waste in a healthy way			1
symptoms include : abdominal pain and diarrhoea tiredness and fatigue feeling generally unwell mouth ulcers loss of appetite and weight loss anaemia - a reduced level of red blood cells it 's estimated around 250,000 people suffer from the condition in the @entity56			2
it can start in any age , but usually appears for the first time between the ages of 10 and 40			2
the disease can cause complications including perforations			0
they happen when a severe blockage ruptures the bowel , making a hole			0
the contents of the bowel can leak through and form an abscess			0
it causes pain and a @entity244 : @entity10 's and @entity56 whatever the cause , there is no cure			1
treatments such as steroids can reduce inflammation and immunosuppressant drugs help to control flare - ups			2
avoiding stress and taking exercise can help , too , but about 60 per cent of patients eventually need surgery			0
the condition can improve with age - so if symptoms are controlled and you get an early diagnosis you may avoid the need for surgery , says professor @entity104			0
' unfortunately that does n't always happen , as often the disease is confused with irritable bowel syndrome ( @entity268 ) , ' says mr @entity128			0
' in the early stages @entity10 's symptoms can be quite subtle			1
' in cases such as @entity36 's , when a lot of damaged intestine has been removed , a colostomy bag may well be the only option			1
the surgery is designed to temporarily divert waste away from the inflamed colon into a bag to allow the colon to heal - the end of the small intestine is disconnected from the colon and rerouted through a hole , known as a stoma , in the abdomen			2
an external bag is attached to the opening to collect the waste			0
once inflammation in the colon has settled down , a second operation is performed to close the stoma and reattach the small intestine to the colon			0
in @entity36 's case , the bags have not worked and doctors are considering other options , even a bowel transplant			2
' but i 'm still really hopeful and after everything i 've been through i know i 'm a strong person , ' @entity83 says			0
' i 'm looking forward to chasing my goals			0
' the mystery for @entity4 is why she developed @entity10 's in the first place , as she ate healthily and there is no family history of the condition			1
she wonders if a stomach bug she caught on holiday in @entity310 in 2011 , when she was 19 , may have triggered it			0
mr @entity128 says the disease can be triggered in this way			0
' when gut bacteria are exposed to a stomach bug or perhaps a new type of food , they can be radically altered in people with a genetic predisposition to @entity10 's , with an increase in harmful bacteria and fewer beneficial bacteria			1
' @entity4 's @entity324 initially diagnosed @entity268			0
like @entity10 's this causes stomach cramps , bloating and diarrhoea , though only @entity10 's causes weight loss and persistent diarrhoea			1
@entity10 's sufferers may also have a ' lump ' in their abdomen			1
but over the next few months @entity4 's symptoms worsened and she was sent back to hospital in february 2013 for a colonoscopy , where the lining of the bowel is examined using a tiny camera			0
this confirmed she had @entity10 's			2
' it was such a relief to know what it was , ' says @entity4 , who is about to start work as an environmental business adviser			0
after three months on steroids she was put on a daily anti-inflammatory drug , @entity349			0
she is likely to have to take this for life			0
@entity4 is now careful about what she eats , limits her alcohol intake and has begun exercising			0
' i 've got no choice but to live with @entity10 's , ' she says			2
' but i 'm determined that i should control it , not let it control me			0

young people receiving treatment for @entity10 's rises 300 per cent in 10 years
use of antibiotics and poor diet may be behind *alarming* figure
