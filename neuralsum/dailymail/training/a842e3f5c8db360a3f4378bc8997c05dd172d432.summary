by @entity0 @entity1 suffered from symptoms such as nausea and back pain when his partner was pregnant - but they were actually signs of cancer a father who suffered the same symptoms as his pregnant partner was horrified to learn they were actually signs of testicular cancer			1
whenever @entity13 complained of nausea or food cravings , @entity1 would do the same			1
the phenomenon , known as ' @entity17 ' , is characterised by symptoms such as morning sickness , cramps , back pain and swollen stomachs in men whose partners are pregnant			1
ms @entity25 , 21 , laughed off his ailments until a week before the birth when mr @entity1 woke in the middle of the night with excruciating back pain			1
after being rushed to hospital at 2am , he mentioned to doctors he had a lump in his testicle			2
eight hours later , tests revealed his symptoms were testicular cancer - which they believe he 'd had for five years			1
mr @entity1 , a delivery driver , said : ' i was absolutely petrified			2
i did n’t know whether they would be able to cure me and @entity39 was due in a week			1
' all i could think was that i might never get to see her grow up			0
' i knew i 'd had the lump for five years , but i never expected it to be cancer			2
' i did have it checked out in march 2009 , but was told it was just fluid and nothing to worry about			0
' testicular cancer is most common in men aged 15 - 44 and affects 2,000 each year in the @entity49			1
it is one of the most treatable cancers - 97 per cent of patients survive for more than five years after diagnosis			0
the most common symptom is a lump or swelling in one testicle , but 20 per cent of patients also experience pain in their testicles or lower abdomen			0
a feeling of ' heaviness ' in the scrotum is another symptom			0
following mr @entity1 's diagnosis , what should have been a week of excitement ahead of @entity39 ’s birth became a nightmare			1
doctors found three tumours - one on his testicle , one in his groin and one on his back - which had caused the agonising pain			1
mr @entity1 was transferred to another hospital in @entity81 to begin chemotherapy just three days later			1
mr @entity1 with partner @entity83 and 10 - month - old daughter @entity39			1
since his diagnosis a week before her birth , he has had treatment for three tumours expectant fathers can suffer from pregnancy symptoms , a study published in 2007 found			1
morning sickness , cramps , back pain and swollen stomachs were all reported by men whose partners were pregnant			1
the phenomenon is known as ' @entity17 '			0
@entity17 comes from the @entity99 word ' couver ' which means ' to hatch ' , but is not a recognised medical condition			0
it is not clear why some men have similar symptoms to their partners , but it could be related to anxiety over the pregnancy , experts claim			0
in the study of men aged 19 - 55 , expectant fathers reported a range of symptoms , including cramps , back pain , mood swings , food cravings , morning sickness , fatigue , depression , fainting , insomnia and toothache			1
in more extreme cases , men developed swollen stomachs that looked like a ' baby bump ' , said the researchers , from @entity129 's @entity128			0
most symptoms disappeared after the birth			0
ms @entity13 , who had to drive from their home in @entity134 to collect him the day before the baby was due , said : ' i just thought he had @entity17 syndrome			2
' whenever my back hurt - his did			0
whenever i felt sick - he did			0
' he even had intense cravings			0
for two weeks all he wanted to eat was cheeseburgers			0
' when he woke up with back ache it was the night after i had gone to hospital with contractions - so i just thought he was mirroring me again			2
' the diagnosis ' completely turned our world upside down ' , she added			0
' we went from being excited to have our first baby to the realisation i might end up a single mum			0
' the stress of mr @entity1 ’s illness caused @entity13 ’s blood pressure to soar and she had to be induced nine days after her due date , giving birth to daughter @entity39			1
mr @entity1 was forced to give up work , needing five bouts of chemotherapy and a lumpectomy in february this year			2
ms @entity13 added : ' it 's been extremely hard work looking after them both			2
' @entity1 is so wiped out that he has n’t been able to change a nappy yet in the 10 months @entity39 has been alive			1
' even if he could do it , he ca n’t as the chance of infection could be fatal for him			0
' fortunately , @entity39 is only 10 months old and does n’t know what ’s wrong with her daddy			2
' the couple became engaged in july 2012 and had planned to wait until @entity39 could walk to marry			2
' but we 've now had to postpone any wedding plans until @entity1 gets the all clear , ' ms @entity13 said			1
