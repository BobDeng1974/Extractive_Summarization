when lawyer @entity1 made her new year 's resolutions , it was n't to give up alcohol or go to the gym more			1
instead the 26 - year - old took on a challenge that would see her living off recycled butcher 's bones , foraging for wild berries and eating food destined for the supermarket bin in her hometown of @entity14			1
miss @entity1 decided to live below the poverty line for a month , and has challenged herself to live on £ 1 a day throughout january			1
she said : ' i wanted to challenge myself for the new year , so i made my resolution to be less wasteful with money and live below the poverty line on £ 1 a day			1
' while she admits some of her meals have not been the finest in cuisine , miss @entity1 said she has managed to survive 28 days so far by living on tins , including tins of curry , and lots of cheap packaged items such as pasta and supermarket own - brand soups			1
she even triumphed in her search among the aisles to find an oyster , reduced to just eight pence			0
pictured on day one of the challenge @entity49 said she was struggling with some of the budget products but she said the biggest task has been finding fresh vegetables at low prices			1
she said : ' my best buy was probably a huge bag of parsnips for 4p which i incorporated into a @entity59 supper			0
i 've also visited @entity60 in @entity17 - a restaurant which serves only food intercepted from supermarket bins , and i 've been foraging for wild berries			2
' miss @entity1 has charted her progress on her own blog , and said it has become suddenly popular as people appeared to like reading about her struggles to enjoy some of her budget meals			1
day 1 - breakfast : cornflakes + office milk lunch : warburton thins + pate dinner : lasagne ( 40p ) + cucumber ( 7p ) treat : few slabs of value choc ( 35p for bar ) + live oyster ( 8p ) day 2 - breakfast : porridge + water lunch : frozen toast from week 1 with ' @entity90 pate ' + 3 remaining fish fingers dinner : fresh egg noodles ( 10p ) + value sweet and sour ( 30p ) + broccoli ( 10p ) treat : reduced doughnuts x 2 day 3 - breakfast : cornflakes ( 30p ) + value yoghurt lunch : burns night – haggis ( £ 1 ) potatoes ( 15p ) parsnips ( 4p ) swede , leeks carrots ( 15p ) dinner : leftover sweet n sour noodles miss @entity1 said own brand soups have helped her feed herself within the tight budget she set treat : reduced doughnuts x 1 day 4 - breakfast : porridge + office milk lunch : skeleton soup + no bread dinner : parsnip ( 4p reduced ) made into roasted chips and chilli ( tinned ) treat : apple , chocolate buttons day 5 - breakfast : 30g of coco snaps + milk lunch : vegetable soup and out of date pitta dinner : @entity129 bol ( tinned ) treat : value onion rings day 6 - breakfast : 30g of coco snaps + office milk lunch : tin of questionable chicken soup + 1 pitta dinner : spaghetti hoops on toast day 7 - breakfast : 30g of coco snaps + office milk lunch : tin of tomato soup + 1 pitta dinner : 250g penne pasta + half carton passata + two onions + four hotdogs + black pepper borrowed from housemate ’s cupboard the blog documents the highs and lows of her progress - including on day 10 when her dog @entity160 stole some treasured reduced doughnuts , saved as rare treats to help her cope during the month long challenge			1
in a post on day 10 she wrote : ' it 's lunchtime and the curry noodles make an appearance , another student classic			0
' at 25p a pack they 're a reliable filler and perfectly edible , if a little beige			0
utilising vegetarian chicken flavouring it 's a tick in the ethics box but a fail on the quest for protein and fresh food			2
' miss @entity1 said doing her shopping on a weekly basis helped , setting herself a maximum budget of £ 7 which forced her to shop creatively and not waste any items			1
buy supermarket own brands for your staples , for example large bags of pasta			0
@entity194 meals in bulk - such as casserole and save portions			0
get to supermarkets for prime reducing times , usually between 7pm and 9pm			0
@entity199 ; t be afraid to ask supermarket workers if something is due to come down in price later that day			2
try something new - such as foraging or venues like @entity205 , a venue in @entity207 that serves food past it sell by date that has been rescued from a sure path to supermarket and restaurant dustbins			2
do n't stick religiously to best before dates , use your own judgement to test some items rather than automatically throwing them out			0
stock up on tinned goods , such as own brand soup			2
three weeks into the challenge @entity49 said she felt she was getting to grips with how to keep her meals low cost and had learnt some tricks , such as foraging for her own berries and making her breakfast at work so she could take advantage of work milk			0
she wrote : ' @entity232 and i 'm starting to get this budget strategy nailed , a combination of bulk cooking and raiding the whoopsie aisles for fresh food bargains seems like the way to go			2
' i recognise that getting to the aisles at the optimum time in order to get my snout in the trough can be a bit of a barrier to fresh produce within the budget			0
it certainly is n't necessarily always practical for those with families or those who work at those times			0
the lawyer has also posted recipes for her some of her creative menus - including for ' skeleton soup ' which she makes from a base of recycled chicken bones , donated from her local butcher			1
miss @entity1 is completing the challenge to raise money for the @entity265 , which aims to tackle poverty in the @entity267 and @entity268			1
miss @entity1 has lost seven pounds by completing the challenge but insists she has not gone hungry			1
she says while it has been a good experience , she is looking forward to being able to treat herself again			0
' i would recommend everyone tries the challenge for a week - it makes you realise how much we waste on food and it really does make you appreciate what you have , ' she added			2
' on a personal note though , i 'm looking forward to having a wine , take - away and film night			0
