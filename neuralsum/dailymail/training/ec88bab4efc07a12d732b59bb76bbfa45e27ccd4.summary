by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 : 13:36 est , 20 december 2013 @entity3 : 13:49 est , 20 december 2013 male soldiers , sailors , marines and airmen are now sharing most of their duties with women , and their testosterone - fueled wartime activities are bringing the worst out of many when women are in close quarters with them president @entity14 put his foot own on friday – sort of – and demanded to know what the @entity16 is doing to stem the tide of military sexual assaults			1
but the answer , he said , can come on december 1 , 2014			0
that 's after the midterm congressional elections , weeks too late to be politically damaging if the military he commands publishes a reminder of how many sex abusers are in the ranks that @entity14 leads as commander - in - chief			1
thursday saw the passage of a wide - ranging national defense budget authorization bill , which included a watered - down version of sexual - assault reforms favored by @entity35 @entity34 sen. @entity33			1
the new law requires the @entity16 to assign an advocate to every servicewoman or man who reports an assault			0
it also bars commanders from overturning sex - assault verdicts			0
but missing from the final bill were @entity33 's more aggressive proposals , including a move to take sexual assault cases completely out of the military chain of command , and another giving prosecutors – not commanding officers – discretion in deciding which cases to take to military court			1
a @entity56 @entity55 aide with knowledge of the back - room deals struck as final passage of the bill neared told @entity61 on friday that the @entity14 administration and many on @entity63 take a more pragmatic approach than @entity33			1
' honestly , i think there 's a fear that the more you demand the @entity16 investigate this , the more ugly stuff they 'll find , ' the aide said			2
' and when you come right down to it , no one really wants to lower the testosterone levels in the military			0
that 's how we win			0
' @entity33 's office did not reply to a request for a response to that statement			0
@entity33 is among a group of female @entity1 senators who have taken a zero - tolerance position on military sexual assaults ' the more you demand the @entity16 investigate this , the more ugly stuff they 'll find , ' predicted one @entity55 aide on the @entity56 side of the aisle @entity14 responded to the new law on friday by setting a progress deadline for defense secretary @entity97 and joint chiefs chairman gen. @entity98 , giving them more than eleven months to report back to the @entity100			1
' i do not want to wait another year to enact the one reform survivors have asked for , ' @entity33 said in a statement immediately after @entity14 released his instructions to the military			1
she said the priority should be ' removing commanders with no legal training and conflicts of interest from the decision of whether or not to prosecute a rape or sexual assault			0
' ' [ m ] y immediate focus , ' @entity33 added , ' will remain on earning the votes to pass the fundamental reform needed to address the fact that last year alone an estimated 23,000 sexual assault victims lacked the confidence to report their attacks out of fear their chain of command would not act – or worse yet – retaliate against them			1
' the @entity100 had released a statement from the president describing how he had ' directed @entity128 , chairman @entity98 and our entire defense leadership team to step up their game exponentially in preventing and responding to the serious crime of sexual assault in our military			2
' ' today , ' @entity14 said , ' i instructed @entity128 and chairman @entity98 to continue their efforts to make substantial improvements with respect to sexual assault prevention and response , including to the military justice system			1
i have also directed that they report back to me , with a full - scale review of their progress , by december 1 , 2014			2
' ' if i do not see the kind of progress i expect , then we will consider additional reforms that may be required			0
' major players : sen. @entity152 ( r ) pressed her colleagues behind the scenes for tougher action , while majority leader @entity156 ( @entity157 ) promised @entity33 a separate vote on her no - nonsense measures that were left out of the larger defense bill what would @entity161 ? one @entity55 aide speculated that the president pushed back his deadline until after the 2014 midterm elections because he fears public recognition of how much sexual assault goes on in the military he commands a @entity100 official told @entity61 that the president ' is serious about resolving this problem in a way that improves , instead of weakens , our military readiness			1
' but the @entity56 @entity55 aide said that ' there 's no way @entity33 was going to get everything she wanted			1
' ' first , there are some old - boy types in the @entity55 who think a lot of this is exaggerated – do n't ask me why , ' he told @entity61			2
' and then there are some on our side who really do n't want to give @entity34 another reason to scream " war on women " next november			0
' far - reaching crisis : a @entity197 man offered $ 20,000 in cash , a @entity199 and a $ 14,000 ring to fellow inmates in an attempt to kill a military rape victim before she testified at his trial @entity14 's move to push his next deadline back to december , the aide said , is likely a way ' to keep @entity34 ' neck out of the noose during the midterms			1
after all , @entity14 owns this military , five years in			2
' the @entity55 approved the larger defense bill on an 84 – 15 vote thursday			2
while it includes more than $ 632 billion for everything from combat pay to new airplanes , the sexual assault provisions provided the most contentious parts of the debate			0
the @entity16 has estimated that more than 26,000 military women and men may have been sexually assaulted in 2012			2
white critics say that estimate is far from a hard number , @entity16 analysts say it could be too low since thousands more are thought to have been too scared to come forward			0
@entity230 @entity34 sen. @entity152 , one of seven women on the @entity232 , praised the outcome thursday as ' a huge win for victims of sexual assault , and for justice in @entity1 's armed forces			0
' ' in the months and years ahead , vigilance will be required to ensure that these historic reforms are implemented forcefully and effectively , ' she said			0
@entity33 's more far - reaching proposals will likely have another hearing as part of a separate bill			1
majority leader @entity156 has reportedly promised her that he will give the more aggressive legislative package a vote early in 2014			0
a @entity16 aide told @entity61 that the @entity16 expects to work with the @entity100 to develop a series of minimum - standards benchmarks that will govern how the military responds to sexual - assault allegations in 2015 and beyond .			1

@entity14 set a dec. 1 , 2014 deadline for a military report on combating sexual assaults
the move followed passage of a watered - down proposal as part of a larger @entity16 funding bill
a @entity55 aide said *rampant* testosterone ' is how we win ' wars
the president may want to push the *timetable* for action past the midterm congressional election for political reasons
a frustrated sen. @entity33 said she does n't want ' to wait another year to enact the one reform survivors have asked for '
