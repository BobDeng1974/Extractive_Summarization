by @entity0 published : 19:14 est , 26 september 2013 updated : 19:16 est , 26 september 2013 @entity1 has been accused of ripping off the taxpayer in a £ 1.2billion government - backed scheme to install broadband in rural areas			1
after ministers pledged in 2011 that 90 per cent of the @entity9 would have superfast internet by 2015 , contracts worth £ 230million were offered to telecoms firms to take on the mammoth task of connecting areas with few people living in them			1
but @entity15 said yesterday that consumers were ‘ getting a raw deal despite the generous public subsidy ’ and that it had not been in the interests of taxpayers to award all 26 contracts to @entity1			1
claims : @entity1 has ' exploited ' its deal to install broadband to rural areas of the @entity9 , a new report has suggested a report by the @entity28 found that the lack of competition has driven up prices , while the programme is now two years behind schedule and costing local councils £ 230million more than the £ 730million anticipated			1
a further 18 contracts worth £ 250million , which are to be awarded in 2015 , are also expected to go to @entity1			1
the mps also accused the telecoms firm of exploiting its position by failing to pass on information about which areas of the country will not be covered by the programme , meaning other firms could not come in to offer services			0
hit out : @entity45 , @entity28 chair , said the consumer was failing to get the benefits of healthy competition and it was criticised for including a clause in its contracts with local authorities that prevent them from disclosing the costs involved to others that are still negotiating their broadband connections			0
this lack of transparency , the report concluded , meant @entity1 ‘ exploited its quasi-monopoly position ’ to limit access to both the wholesale and retail market ‘ to the detriment of the consumer ’			1
@entity45 , the committee ’s chairman , said : ‘ the consumer is failing to get the benefits of healthy competition and @entity1 will end up owning assets created from £ 1.2billion of public money			1
@entity1 is supposed to provide at least 90 per cent coverage in rural areas , but it is preventing local authorities from publishing information on the areas the company will and will not cover			1
‘ details of speed and coverage in each local project are also being kept confidential , preventing other suppliers from developing schemes aimed at reaching the remaining 10 per cent of premises and stopping communities and others from identifying alternative ways of providing superfast broadband			0
’ @entity1 ’s outgoings are also £ 200million less than anticipated when the scheme was set up			1
mrs @entity45 concluded : ‘ the lack of transparency over @entity1 ’s costs is a serious risk to value for money			0
’ but communications minister @entity94 denied that @entity1 was ripping off the country and said it was offering ‘ great value for money ’			2
he said : ‘ it is true we are investing £ 1.2billion in superfast broadband ; it ’s not true the costs are out of control			0
@entity1 ’s costs stack up			0
they put the money up front			0
we will see all the invoices @entity1 present			0
‘ i do n’t anticipate @entity1 trying to pull a fast one			0
@entity1 is delivering under our scheme to up to 10,000 homes now ; it will deliver to millions of people over the next two years with the best value - for - money , government - sponsored broadband scheme you will pretty much find anywhere in the world			1
’ dispute : a @entity1 spokesman said they were ' disturbed ' by the report , which they believe was ' wrong ' a @entity1 spokesman said : ‘ we are disturbed by the report , which we believe is simply wrong and fails to take on board a point - by - point correction we sent to the committee several weeks ago			2
‘ we have been transparent from the start and willing to invest when others have not			0
it is mystifying that we are being criticised for accepting onerous terms in exchange for public subsidy – terms which drove others away			2
the taxpayer is undoubtedly getting value for money			0
’ @entity138 , digital policy analyst at the @entity140 ’ @entity137 , said : ‘ there needs to be far more transparency about @entity1 ’s costs , take - up rates and roll - out plans to ensure that taxpayers are not being fleeced and so that other suppliers can get on with filling the black spots not covered by @entity1			2
‘ taxpayers should be deeply concerned that the broadband programme in its current form has seen hundreds of millions of pounds of their money wasted as a result of a centralised , one - size - fits - all scheme for fixed - line only internet connections			2

ministers pledged in 2011 that 90 per cent of the @entity9 would have broadband
all 26 contracts for the scheme were awarded to @entity1
@entity15 today said consumers were ‘ getting a raw deal despite the generous public subsidy ’ and @entity1 had ' exploited its quasi-monopoly position '
programme two years behind and cost £ 230million more than anticipated
