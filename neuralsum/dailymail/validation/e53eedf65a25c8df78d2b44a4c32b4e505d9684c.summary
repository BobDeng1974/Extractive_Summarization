home secretary @entity0 , pictured in @entity1 today , insisted the net migration target was ' important ' , even though latest data shows the figure hit 300,000 last year the @entity5 are to repeat a pledge to cut net migration to the tens of thousands , despite utterly failing to meet it during the last five years			1
home secretary @entity0 insisted the target was ' important ' , even though latest data shows the figure hit 300,000 last year - three times what @entity12 promised			1
the net migration target is now set to be included in the @entity5 manifesto for may 's general election , after mrs may and mr @entity12 rejected repeated warnings that it was a mistake			1
a total of 298,000 more people arrived in @entity22 than left in the year to september , as the numbers arriving from the rest of the @entity25 hit a record high			1
before the last election mr @entity12 pledged to cut the figure below 100,000 , a promise he repeated in 2011 : ' no ifs			2
' a record 624,000 arrived in @entity22 in a year , up from 530,000 in the previous 12 months			1
at the same time , 327,000 left , a figure which has barely changed since 2010			1
senior @entity34 including @entity35 last week tried to claim the failure to meet the target was a ' problem of success ' because workers from struggling @entity42 economies were flocking to booming @entity22			2
but calls have grown for the @entity34 to ditch the pledge , because the government is unable to control the numbers arriving from the @entity25			2
senior figures , including chancellor @entity48 , health secretary @entity49 and communities secretary @entity50 are understood to have voiced doubts about the idea			2
former home secretary @entity53 said globalisation had made the immigration target impossible to meet , while @entity56 , an @entity57 party chairwoman , said it was ' unrealistic '			1
now mrs may has signalled that she intends to include a pledge on net migration in the conservative manifesto			1
' i think we will keep the target , ' she told @entity65			0
' it is important because it is about not just dealing with those coming into the system but also about making sure that those people who should n't live here actually leave			2
' she added : ' you will have to wait for the manifesto to see the exact words			0
the idea of the net migration target will still be there			1
' @entity12 , jan 2010 ' levels of immigration can return to where they were in the 1980s and 90s			0
net migration to this country will be in the order of tens of thousands each year			1
that 's a promise we made to the @entity22 people			2
' @entity12 , april 2011 ' when we made that comment ... we were very clear that was what we wanted to do			0
it remains the objective towards which the prime minister and others are working			1
' @entity0 , nov 10 ' it is , of course , unlikely that we are going to reach the tens of thousands by the end of the @entity107			0
' @entity0 , nov 23 she also sought to put pressure on other cabinet ministers , with a warning that the impact of immigration is felt across @entity113			0
mrs may said : ' obviously the @entity115 is responsible for @entity22 visas and immigration , the @entity118 and immigration enforcement but actually immigration is an issue that touches across government departments and has a whole number of different aspects			2
' it affects issues around jobs , questions of illegal working , access to housing , education , the @entity133			0
' it touches all government departments and i think that 's the thing that 's important			0
' @entity1 blames the increase on the number of people moving from within the @entity25 , which the government can not control			2
ministers have argued that immigration from outside the @entity25 has been falling as a result of tighter border restrictions			2
however , @entity147 net migration is at its highest level since the end of december 2011			1
mrs may revealed she faced a battle with officials to get them to accept that immigration could cause problems			0
' there was a problem with the orthodoxy in @entity113 when we came into government in 2010 , ' she said			0
' it was the idea that immigration by definition was good - in that automatically if you 've got more people , gdp goes up			0
' of course , gdp per head does n't necessarily go up - so they did n't look beyond that point			0
' prime minister @entity12 promised before the election to cut net immigration in the tens of thousands former home secretary @entity53 said globalisation had made the immigration target impossible to meet , while @entity56 , an @entity57 party chairwoman , said it was ' unrealistic ' @entity1 insisted mr @entity12 's ' ambition ' to reduce net migration below 100,000 remained			1
mr @entity12 's official spokesman told a regular @entity179 media briefing : ' you wo n't be surprised to know that he takes a different view from @entity53 on this one			0
it wo n't be the first time that he and @entity53 have n't had exactly the same views			0
' the spokesman said the prime minister 's views on the need to reduce annual net migration below 100,000 had not changed since a speech in november , when he said that it remained an ' ambition ' , even if it was not possible to achieve it during this @entity107			1
when the latest figures were released last week , deputy prime minister @entity196 today said the @entity34 must now ' quite rightly suffer the embarrassment ' of breaking the promise			1
@entity201 , director of the @entity202 think tank , said : ' if the prime minister remains in denial about the broken target , he is setting himself up for five more years of failure			1
it is already clear there is next to no chance of meeting the same target in the next @entity107 either			0
' it 's absurd to think that anyone would believe this broken promise if it 's made again			0
' there is a simple political moral to this tale : careless promises cost trust			0
