prosecutors friday were waiting for the results of a police investigation into the killing of a burglar by an 80 - year - old @entity9 homeowner who says he shot the woman in the back as she fled his home and ran down an alley , the district attorney 's office said			1
@entity15 resident @entity14 , 80 , told @entity16 that the burglar had said she was pregnant and asked @entity14 not to fire , but he shot her twice in the back anyway			1
an autopsy later found that @entity20 , 28 , was not pregnant , said coroner 's spokesman @entity21			1
' it 's ongoing , and so we 're waiting at this point			0
' prosecutors filed murder , burglary , robbery and weapons charges against @entity29 , 26 , a suspected accomplice of @entity20			1
he was being held on bail of more than $ 1 million			0
a court appearance initially set for friday was rescheduled for next month			0
the murder charge is possible because @entity29 is accused of participating in a felony that led to a death , said @entity15 police chief @entity53			2
police said friday that @entity29 ' mother , @entity55 , also was involved , and she was arrested thursday night on suspicion of robbery			2
they gave no details on her alleged role or the evidence against her			0
@entity53 said the homeowner came home around 9 p.m. tuesday and surprised @entity29 and @entity20 , who were trying to break into a safe			1
they assaulted him , breaking his collarbone , before he was able to get a handgun , the chief said			0
police said he fired shots inside and outside his house			0
he reportedly told knbc on wednesday : ' [ @entity20 ] says , " do n't shoot me , i 'm pregnant , i 'm going to have a baby , ' and i shot her anyway			1
' @entity14 told @entity72 4 he believes he was acting in self defense			2
he said when the pair saw he was armed , they allegedly ran out of the house , but @entity14 told the tv station that he fired on them , hitting the woman			2
break in : @entity14 claims @entity20 and @entity29 assaulted him when he caught them and he was acting in self - defense he allegedly added he had no regrets about the shooting , telling knbc : ' when the time comes to defend yourself , you best do something			1
' under @entity9 law , homeowners have a right to protect themselves with deadly force inside their homes and in the immediate vicinity - such as a patio - if they feel they are in imminent danger of great bodily injury or death , said @entity96 , a former federal prosecutor who teaches law at @entity98			2
but this case enters a gray area because @entity14 , by his own account , chased the burglars and fired at them outside his home as they were fleeing , @entity96 said			0
' the problem here is that all this happens very fast and his legal right to use force probably ended just a few seconds before he did use deadly force , ' @entity96 said			0
' so the question is should you charge somebody on the basis of what really was a series of split - second decisions when he 's just been robbed and physically assaulted ? ' @entity53 declined to say how many shots were fired or to confirm that @entity20 was shot in the back			1
no phone listing was available for @entity14 and he could not be reached for comment by @entity120 .			0
