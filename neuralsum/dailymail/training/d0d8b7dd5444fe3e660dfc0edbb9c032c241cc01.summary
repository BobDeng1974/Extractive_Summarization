with his big , black eyes , forlorn expression and ginger fur , this adorable ginger cat bears an uncanny resemblance to the famous on - screen feline from the shrek films			1
and just like @entity8 - who is known for his ability to mesmerize characters with his wide - eyed gaze - @entity12 the cat knows how to get his own way by pulling the meek kitty cat expression			1
@entity17 , who lives in @entity36 , said : ' @entity12 is very possessive of me			1
' at the time of the photo , i was sitting on the couch with my computer on my lap , which is strictly his spot			0
' i think the combination of my lap being occupied and my typing made him a little upset			0
' i looked down and thought he looked so funny that i called for my partner , @entity48 , to come and take a photo of him			0
@entity12 ( right ) is seen staring intently at his owner until she finally caves and puts her work to one side			2

' it works every single time , you 'd have to have a heart of stone not to give into a face like that			0
