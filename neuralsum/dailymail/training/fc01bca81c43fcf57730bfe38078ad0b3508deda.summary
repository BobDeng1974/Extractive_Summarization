by @entity1 reporter published : 11:34 est , 23 january 2013 updated : 12:41 est , 23 january 2013 a father who lived with a rare disease for more than 40 years without realising was finally diagnosed after a doctor saw him tie his shoelaces			1
@entity8 @entity7 was with his daughter @entity9 , aged six , at @entity10 , @entity11 , for treatment for her condition @entity14 ( @entity14 )			1
@entity9 was diagnosed with @entity14 when she was three - years - old - which causes her to bruise and damage her skin easily			0
@entity7 with the shoes that meant he was diagnosed with the same condition as his daughter @entity9			1
pictured with his partner @entity20 mr @entity7 , 45 , was with his daughter for this trip to the hospital when her doctor noticed something unusual about the way he bent over to do his laces - and realised he was suffering from the same condition			1
@entity7 had never shown any sign he might carry the hereditary genetic condition until @entity9 ’s doctor , @entity31 , spotted him bending his wrists at an odd angle			1
now @entity7 is hoping highlight the condition after revealing how he was diagnosed for first time			1
@entity7 , from @entity11 , said : ' i do n’t know what the doctor saw , she just realised i had the same condition as @entity39			1
' in my life @entity14 has n’t been a problem as i did n’t even know i had it , but that ’s the thing with the condition it effects different people different ways , there could be lots of people who do n’t know they have it			2
' we were so relieved when @entity9 was diagnosed as we knew there was something wrong with her , it was so strange to see the way her skin broke when she was bumped			0
' i never expected the doctor to say i had the condition too , i had no clue , it was just so strange especially because @entity9 ’s symptoms were so severe			0
' we just see @entity14 as normal life now where we have to take extra precautions			0
although i ca n’t help but feel responsible for @entity9 having the condition , in a way it ’s nice that we can share it and i can support her through it			0
' ian with his daughter and dr @entity31 who diagnosed him after she noticed his wrists were bent at an odd angle there are several types of @entity14 which affect just one in 5,000 people			2
it is a genetic connective tissue condition caused by a defect in the protein collagen , the main building block of the body which provides strength and support			0
as well as the classic @entity14 symptoms which @entity39 has , the disease also commonly causes hyper - mobility , where joint and ligaments are lax			2
dr @entity31 , lead clinician for @entity14 at @entity86 , spotted @entity7 tying his shoelaces , noticing his hyper mobility and ran tests			1
she said : ' it is so rare for someone to live with @entity14 and not know , the condition is usually diagnosed in early childhood			2
' because the condition is hereditary we always test parents to see if they carry the gene , but i have never seen a case like this before where a parent had @entity14 but did n’t know			1
' there is no cure for @entity14 but lots of preventions which we put in place			0
@entity9 wears special tights to school to protect her legs and because the condition can cause various problems @entity7 now has annual heart checks			2
' dr @entity31 and her team of seven run the @entity115 and see patients from across the north of @entity118 and @entity119			0
the team recently ran an @entity14 awareness day where @entity9 and @entity7 met other @entity14 patients , had specialist assessments and group education sessions			1
@entity9 said : ' i really enjoyed the day because i got to meet other children with @entity14 where i live it ’s only me and dad so it has been good to see other children like me			0
' the national @entity14 service at @entity10 , @entity11 was set up in 2009 and is asked to see around 200 new patients every year			0
the centre is the only place in the country with labs where the faulty @entity14 gene can be detected			1
before the service in @entity11 began , samples had to be sent to labs in parts of @entity140 and @entity141			0
for more information about the service visit @entity144			0

@entity7 took his daughter , who has @entity14 , to a hospital appointment
hereditary condition can cause bruising and lax joints that bend too far
usually if child has it , both parents are *unaffected* *carriers* of the faulty gene
but doctor realised @entity7 had the condition after seeing him tie his shoelaces
