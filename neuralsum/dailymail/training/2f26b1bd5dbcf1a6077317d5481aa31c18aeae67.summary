councillor @entity99 said : ‘ the fortunate thing is that there was no one left in that building when the explosion happened			2
‘ the bungalow has literally been smashed to smithereens			0

this will be a tragedy for the family			0
’ and villager @entity116 said her neighbours were stunned by the damage done to the property			2
