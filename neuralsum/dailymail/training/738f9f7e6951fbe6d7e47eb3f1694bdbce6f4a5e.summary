by @entity0 published : 16:59 est , 24 may 2013 updated : 17:00 est , 24 may 2013 @entity2 's definition of affordable varies dramatically according to the country it is operating in @entity2 presents itself as the champion of affordable home furnishings			0
but it appears that the store ’s definition of affordable varies dramatically according to the country it is operating in			0
@entity13 families are being charged about 70 per cent more for some items of furniture compared with their counterparts on the continent			1
a snapshot survey of popular @entity2 items – from armchairs and sofas to a chest of drawers and a rug – found that , on average , customers in @entity13 are paying more for exactly the same product			1
for example , @entity2 ’s popular @entity28 corner sofa bed costs £ 525 if bought in its @entity13 stores – some 71 per cent more than the £ 307 charged in @entity31 , and also considerably more than the £ 344 in @entity32 and @entity33			1
the sofa is also cheaper in @entity2 ’s home country of @entity36 – renowned for its relatively high cost of living – where it comes in at £ 400			1
a similar pattern is seen on items including the @entity41 gazebo , which costs £ 250 in the @entity13 , versus a cheapest figure of £ 158 in @entity43			1
it is £ 205 in @entity31 and £ 215 in @entity32 and @entity33			1
the price differences were not consistent and in some cases @entity13 families were paying less , which suggests shopping at @entity2 offers something of a geographic lottery in terms of value			1
on the face of it , the prices tend to be lower in countries with lower wages and living standards , however this does not always hold true			0
across the eight items surveyed , the @entity13 total cost of £ 2,215 was higher than the £ 2,038.60 for @entity33 and £ 2,177 in @entity43			1
it was some £ 467 – 26.7 per cent – more than the £ 1,748 total in @entity31 , and £ 380 more than @entity32 ’s £ 1,835			1
the findings echo a pattern seen in the past among brands of perfume and beauty products , designer clothes , trainers and cars sold globally			0
it will also fuel the belief that multi-national companies view @entity13 as a ‘ @entity74 ’ where they can get away with higher prices and bigger profits			1
and it can be hard enough getting an @entity2 flatpack home in the car , let alone on public transport , so it ’s unlikely many @entity13 will be popping over to @entity83 to collect the store ’s cheaper wardrobe			1
while in opposition , @entity87 business secretary @entity86 made government failures to tackle higher @entity13 prices a campaigning issue			1
any suggestion that @entity2 , which is hugely successful and profitable , is charging more in the @entity13 risks alienating shoppers here			1
however , the company , supported by several retail analysts , suggested the gaps have more to do with the relatively high cost of doing business in @entity13			2
professor @entity99 , a marketing expert at the @entity101 business school , said : ‘ @entity2 looks cut - price but it is a rich @entity36 " category killer " which exploits its position			0
‘ it is ruthless on the business side			0
’ he added : ‘ a price is based on three separate factors – cost , what the customer will pay and what the competition are charging			2
@entity2 wins in terms of what the customers will pay and it beats the competition			0
a snapshot survey of popular @entity2 items - from armchairs and sofas to a chest of drawers and a rug - found that , on average , customers in @entity13 are paying more for exactly the same product ‘ people are seduced by the domestic atmosphere and the impression of value in its stores			2
of course the company will charge what it can get away with			0
’ he said the cost of doing business is higher in @entity13 versus countries like @entity31 and also suggested our welfare state effectively props up prices here			1
this is because benefits guarantee a certain level of income , meaning retailers can get away with charging more in @entity13			2
prof @entity99 said it would be wrong for the @entity13 to believe that the higher prices we pay are some kind of badge demonstrating a better quality of life			2
‘ @entity31 is full of smart hard - working people , and we @entity153 kid ourselves if we think we are superior			2
not any longer , ’ he said			0
@entity156 of analysts @entity155 rejected the idea consumers here are victims of a rip - off culture , and also argued the raised prices are more likely to be the result of higher business costs			2
‘ furniture retailers have driven down prices to survive – and many have n’t , ’ he added			0
‘ @entity2 is unquestionably very competitively priced			0
it has that end of the market to itself because all the other furniture retailers are so frightened of it			0
’ @entity171 , professor of retail studies at the @entity172 , said prices will also fluctuate depending on what was selling well in each country			0
an @entity2 spokesman said : ‘ low price is the cornerstone of the @entity2 vision , and we will always remain focused on giving our customers the best value for money			0
‘ prices are set once a year and are subject to a number of factors in each country , such as vat , exchange rates , corporation taxes , wages , energy and transportation costs , which impact on the actual cost of offering that product in each country where @entity2 operates			0
‘ we guarantee our customers in the @entity13 the lowest prices in the market with a substantial price distance to the competition			2
