@entity0 says leaders should take the initiative to change @entity3 , not simply blog or complain the letters by admiral @entity5 and @entity6 are the ones that matter , and the issues they raised should be addressed			1
my objection is that instead of merely raising questions , people should contribute to the party by working for it			1
the problems have to be , and will be , addressed			1
it wo n’t take more than a month or so for the party to set everything right			1
talking about the funds , i will say let the expenses and accounts reach the office			1
we have fought three elections in a year , which is too much for any small party			1
every single issue raised is important for the party			1
the only problem is that this should not be done via the media ; it needs to be done by holding internal talks			1
@entity32 should have demanded that the recordings and the minutes be made public in the meeting which he had attended			1
what is the meaning of simply raising questions ? every leader needs to think about it			1
if a volunteer is punished when he is wrong , even leaders should be held accountable			2
the party ’s national executive was called only to tackle the problems			2
the issues raised are important , and people should take the onus to set the system right and not simply raise questions or write blogs			2
i genuinely feel @entity52 is a very respectful person			2
when he made those statements , my respect ( for him ) went down a bit			2
i would definitely like to see him as a leader of the party			1
we do n’t expect him to make a mistake at all			0
there is no question of his marginalisation			0
he should be supported for a larger , better role by everyone			0
@entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 need to apologise sincerely for what they have done			0
they need to be pulled up			0
every volunteer wants transparency on accounts , candidate selection and other decisions			0
we had six months after the @entity83 polls			0
why did n’t those who raise questions help carve out these mechanisms then ? the camp system is wrong and if it exists , it should be demolished			0
i do not want to comment on @entity89 at all			0
as a volunteer i beg and plead all leaders to thrash out their differences			0
we should have more faces , there are many leading lights			0
and women need to be brought forward .			0
