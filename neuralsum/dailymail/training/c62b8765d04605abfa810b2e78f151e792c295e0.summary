@entity0 emerged as one of the main beneficiaries of an extraordinary day in @entity3 that saw five of the top 10 lose and @entity5 discuss having an operation next month			2
the @entity9 @entity8 ’s chances of making the field for the @entity11 were bolstered by some of his rivals falling at the @entity14 , plus those assured of qualification , such as @entity5			2
@entity0 lost only four points on his serve in the opening set as he registered a decent 7 - 5 , 6 - 2 win over towering pole @entity20 to make the third round			1
in doing so he pushed himself very close to the frame for the eight - man field who will contest the season - ending championships at the @entity27			0
he is due to meet @entity29 ’s @entity28 on thursday morning and victory would put him within a sliver — a mere five ranking points — of the eighth qualifying place currently occupied by @entity35 ’s @entity34			1
@entity0 beat @entity20 in the second round of the @entity14 on thursday @entity5 lost to @entity37 and has a nagging problem with his appendix that may require surgery @entity41 is out of the @entity42 after suffering a second - round exit against @entity45 ’s @entity44			1
the sixth seed lost 6 - 4 , 7 - 5			1
the @entity9 no 1 was looking to regain the title she won in 2012 but teenager @entity44 , the world no 122 , proved too strong			0
@entity41 had lost in the first round of her previous four tournaments before beating @entity54 @entity53 earlier this week			0
it is still conceivable that the year ’s ninth - ranked player could make it to @entity58 as there has to be a doubt over @entity5 , who has a nagging problem with his appendix that he believes will require surgery			0
the @entity64 lost 6 - 3 , 7 - 6 to compatriot @entity37 and then declared that he hoped to complete the season before having any operation , even though it could compromise his preparation for january ’s @entity69			1
‘ my thought is to continue and play @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity58 , ’ said @entity5			0
‘ it ’s true that i have n’t had the best of luck since @entity76			0
@entity0 will face @entity28 on thursday , and a win will take him within five ranking points of eighth @entity35 @entity34 currently holds the eighth qualifying position that @entity0 is attempting to take ' i was having a very good year and after that i was unlucky with my wrist and what is going on now			1
' @entity5 also found himself replaced as world no 2 by @entity86 after the great @entity87 saved five match points to avoid the pile - up of the seeds			2
he looked down and out against @entity92 ’s @entity91 before coming through 7 - 5 , 3 - 6 , 7 - 6 — winning the decisive tiebreaker 9 - 7			1
it is not unusual to have strange results at this time of the season , which comes after the @entity98 but before the climax at the last @entity101 event in @entity72 followed by the @entity27			0
some players are carrying injuries , some very motivated , others demotivated and others just plain tired out by this stage of a long year			0
but losing five of the top 10 in one day is excessive even by october ’s standards			0
aside from @entity5 there were defeats for @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 , while @entity34 retired injured			1
the latter two , ranked eight and 10 , are particularly relevant to @entity0 in the scramble for places in @entity58 , making thursday 's match against @entity28 , currently ranked one place below him at 10 , especially important .			2

@entity0 beat @entity20 7 - 5 , 6 - 2 at the @entity14
@entity5 lost to @entity37 and is struggling with injury
aside from @entity5 there were defeats for @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 , while @entity34 retired injured
if @entity0 beats @entity28 on thursday , he will be within five ranking points of the eighth qualifying place for the @entity11
@entity34 currently holds the position that @entity0 is trying to *hijack*
