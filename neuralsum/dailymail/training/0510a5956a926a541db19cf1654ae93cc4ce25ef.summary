by @entity0 last updated at 10:25 am on 31st august 2011 @entity2 ’s debt levels are dangerously high and are damaging the economy , according to one of the world ’s leading financial watchdogs			1
debt in the @entity2 grew faster than in any other major economy in the last decade to £ 180,000 per household			1
it means the country is in the danger zone following a ten - year borrowing binge under the last @entity14 government , a hard - hitting report from the @entity16 has revealed			2
dangerously high debt : the @entity2 economy has flat - lined for the last nine months its chief economist , @entity19 , said : ‘ beyond a certain level , debt is bad for growth			1
at low levels , debt is good			2
it is a source of economic growth and stability			0
but at high levels , private and public debt is bad , increasing volatility and retarding growth			2
’ the @entity16 said government , corporate and household debt in @entity2 jumped from 223 per cent of gross domestic product in 2000 , or £ 2.18trillion , to 322 per cent , or £ 4.68trillion , in 2010			1
that is the equivalent of £ 180,000 per household			0
the 99 percentage point increase was the biggest of any leading economy and left @entity2 deeper in the red than any country in the @entity41 except @entity42			1
the watchdog warned that debt levels in @entity2 ‘ will explode ’ unless it gets to grips with future spending on health and pensions as the population gets older			1
‘ the debt problems facing advanced economies are even worse than we thought , ’ said mr @entity19 , who is based at the @entity16 headquarters in @entity50 , @entity51			2
‘ as public debt rises and populations age , growth will fall			0
as growth falls , debt rises even more , reinforcing the downward impact on an already low growth rate			0
hard - hitting : the report came from the @entity16 in @entity51 ‘ the only possible conclusion is that those with high debt must act quickly and decisively to address their looming fiscal positions			0
' the longer they wait , the bigger the negative impact will be on growth , and the harder it will be adjust			0
’ the @entity72 welcomed the report – called @entity74 – which was presented to central bankers and economists at the @entity78 summit in @entity79 last week			0
‘ this underlines the need for us to get a grip on our debt levels , ’ said a spokesman			0
‘ part of the reason the recovery is a challenging one is because all parts of the economy are having to adjust – and the numbers will continue to get bigger unless we get them under control			0
’ the watchdog said the danger limit for government debt is 80 to 100 per cent of a country ’s gdp			1
the threshold for corporate debt is 90 per cent of gdp and for household debt it is 85 per cent , it said			0
once these levels are reached , debt starts to hold back growth , the report found			0
in 2010 , @entity2 had government debt of nearly 90 per cent of @entity98 , corporate debt of 126 per cent and household debt of 106 per cent			1
of the @entity113 economies , only @entity2 and @entity111 were in the danger zone for all three types of debt			1
the @entity2 economy has flat - lined for the last nine months , growing by just 0.2 per cent in the second quarter of the year following six months of stagnation			1
the subdued recovery at home has been weakened further by a slowdown overseas , particularly in the @entity123 and the eurozone , @entity2 ’s two biggest trade partners .			2

debt in @entity2 grew faster than any other major economy
the country must ' get to grips ' with future spending on health and pensions
