@entity1 team principal @entity0 has former driver @entity2 to thank for their ' camouflage car ' in testing this week			1
the black - and - white livery design is visually refractive , ensuring rivals face a tough time trying to ascertain the car 's aerodynamics			1
@entity0 has conceded the idea was spawned by @entity2 's helmet design seen over the course of the @entity14 @entity13 weekend last year			1
the @entity16 takes to the track in @entity18 @entity1 driver @entity19 drives the camouflage car during testing on sunday at the @entity18 in @entity22 @entity1 mechanics surround the livery designed car in the garage as @entity19 waits to get out on the track on sunday the black - and - white livery design is visually refractive , ensuring rivals face a tough time trying to ascertain the car 's aerodynamics			1
although four - times champion @entity2 has moved on to @entity32 , @entity0 said : ' @entity34 's helmet was quite fun , so we thought it would be interesting to extend that concept to the rest of the car			2
' @entity39 ( @entity40 , owner ) liked it when he saw it , and it epitomises @entity1 that we like to do things a bit differently			0
' to see a @entity1 in a different livery is striking and it makes it difficult to get detailed photographs of the car , as it confuses the eyeline , at a time of year when we 're all trying to be as secretive as we possibly can			2
' but it 's obviously had a great reaction			0
team principal @entity0 revealed the design of the test car was inspired by one of @entity2 's helmet designed last season the design is meant to make it difficult for rivals to get detailed pictures of the car as they hope for secrecy during testing @entity0 admitted the car is likely to return to its traditional colours for the first race of the but will feature a stronger livery design ' it 's been extremely well received			1
' fans , in particular , are keen for @entity1 to run the livery over the course of the season			2
@entity0 has conceded that will not be the case , he added : ' the fans wo n't be disappointed because the livery will be even stronger			0
' there was little sign , however , of the car in action on the morning of the second day of the test at the @entity18			2
that was due to the fact new recruit @entity82 , promoted from @entity84 to fill @entity2 's shoes , damaged the one - and - only front - wing available to the team on an early installation lap. new @entity1 driver @entity82 damaged the car 's only front wing during the testing session on sunday the 20 - year - old @entity93 driver has replaced @entity2 for the 2015 season after being promoted from @entity84 despite lacking a spare , @entity95 still ran on track without a wing for a handful of laps before deciding to pit and wait for the new part to arrive from the factory in @entity103			1
@entity0 said : ' unfortunately @entity82 very lightly touched the tyre wall with the front wing , causing damage			0
' it 's the only front - wing assembly we have in @entity18 at the moment , which is relatively usual for this time of year when you are not abundant with spare parts			0
' there are more components coming down later today , this evening and over the next two days			0
we 'll certainly have a new front wing by tomorrow morning			0
