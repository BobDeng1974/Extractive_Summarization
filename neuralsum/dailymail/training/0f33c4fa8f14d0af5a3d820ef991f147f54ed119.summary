the camp was expanded under horrific working conditions by prisoners - and operated until the fall of the fascist regime in 1945			0
thousands of prisoners were worked to death			0

it was the original model for all concentration camps - divided into barracks , workshops and areas where medical experiments took place and the crematorium			0
however it is believed that rather than gas chambers , the @entity111 used this area as a firing range and gallows for most prisoners			0

mr @entity12 did not say what he had given the boy , only that he ' hoped it helped him '			1
after the families compared details of mr @entity12 's service with mr @entity11 's memories , the personal histories matched up			1
mr @entity11 , a retired psychologist , told the @entity55 : ' i recalled thinking : '' if this is true , there is some @entity164 in this world			1
'' ' he shared his stories of being held in a @entity30 prison camp which left him starved and beaten within an inch of his life			0
