by @entity0 a prison doctor has been fired and two other staffers are in the midst of being dismissed after an inmate at the @entity5 starved himself to death , a case that has exposed lapses in medical treatment and in how hunger strikes are handled at the facility			1
prison officials have asked prosecutors to investigate after @entity0 began asking questions about the inmate 's death			1
@entity17 , 57 and with just three years left on a nine - year sentence for drug offenses , began to spiral out of control in the spring of 2013 after he stopped taking anti-anxiety medication			1
seven months later , in december , after weeks of erratic behavior â € ” from telling prison staff he felt anxious and paranoid to banging his head on his cell door â € ” @entity17 eventually refused most of his meals			1
hunger strike : @entity17 died in january after a four - month hunger strike that was ignored by prison medical staff by the time of his death in january of this year , he had shed more than 30 pounds on his 6 - foot frame and died weighing just 138 pounds , according to documents reviewed by @entity0			1
an internal investigation determined that medical personnel failed to provide him anti-anxiety medication that may have kept his suicidal thoughts at bay and did n't take steps to check on him as his condition worsened			2
the internal review of @entity17 's death also exposed broader problems involving the treatment of inmates â € ” including a failure to regularly check inmates on medical rounds and communication lapses among medical staff			1
the @entity0 , tipped off to @entity17 's death , obtained scores of documents under @entity5 's @entity52 , including a report detailing the investigation into @entity17 's death , an autopsy report and personnel files			1
along with interviews with corrections officials and correspondence with inmates , the documents describe @entity17 's increasingly paranoid behavior until his death and the numerous opportunities for various prison staff to have intervened			1
' it 's just very , very , very disturbing , ' said @entity67 , a @entity68 , @entity69 - based attorney who specializes in inmate rights litigation and reviewed some of the documents obtained by the @entity0 ' how do you just watch a man starve to death ? ' according to the report of the internal investigation , @entity17 stopped taking medications for anxiety in may 2013			1
seven months later , he told the lead prison psychologist , @entity80 , on dec. 3 that he felt anxious and paranoid and wanted to restart those medications			0
but the psychologist concluded @entity17 did n't have any significant mental health issues even though @entity17 repeatedly talked about wanting to hurt himself			2
@entity80 and an associate considered his comments vague , and his request for medication was denied			0
seven days later , on dec. 10 , @entity17 began banging his head on his cell door and was moved to an observation cell where he refused meals and told the prison psychologist , ' i do n't have any hope			1
' he soon began refusing most food , though he drank team on occasion while continuing to make threats to hurt himself in the ensuing weeks			0
dismissed : one doctor already has been fired and another is on his way out after allowing @entity17 to starve to death at the @entity5 a nurse checked on @entity104 on jan. 4 , finding him weak and shaky , and advised him to resume eating			1
@entity17 responded that it had been too long for him to start taking food again			2
nine days later , on the very day he died , an advanced practice registered nurse named @entity109 refused a request from other medical staffers to move him to the infirmary at 11:51 a.m. and said the inmate should be taken off a hunger strike watch , according to the internal investigative report			1
guards found @entity17 unresponsive in his cell hours later , his head slumped to the side			0
he was pronounced dead at 5:29 p.m. @entity122 coroner @entity121 classified @entity17 's death as a suicide and listed dehydration as the primary cause of death , with starvation and several other medical ailments as secondary causes			1
the documents obtained by the @entity0 show a prison system with a dated protocol for handling hunger strikes , staff who were n't familiar with its provisions , and others who said they were told not to follow them			0
in @entity17 's case , those in charge of his well - being were simply counting on him to cave in and start eating again on his own , the records show			1
on jan. 16 , three days after @entity17 's death , @entity146 , the lead physician at the maximum - security prison , signed off on a nurse 's note about @entity104 consistently refusing food and being taken off of the hunger strike watch because he drank tea			1
during the internal investigation , @entity146 said he believed a hunger strike consisted of missing ' six or eight meals ' and ended when the inmate ate or drank anything at all			1
in a revealing exchange , investigators asked @entity146 how he thought inmates are supposed to be removed from a hunger strike			0
@entity146 told them that prison staff ' usually do n't have to worry about it because they ( the inmates ) eventually give up			0
' when @entity17 stopped eating regularly , the @entity166 's existing guidelines recommended multiple checks of the inmate 's vital signs three times a week , repeated visits with a physician and ongoing evaluations by a psychologist			1
medical staff would later tell internal investigators they were either unfamiliar with the protocols for handling a hunger strike or that @entity179 and @entity109 forbade those procedures from being used			2
there is no mention of whether anyone considered force - feeding the inmate			0
corrections investigators determined @entity17 continued to refuse most food , though he drank tea on occasion while continuing to make threats to hurt himself in the ensuing weeks			2
investigators concluded that @entity17 refused 35 of 36 meals before his death			1
the state has placed @entity80 , who is also in private practice in @entity195 , @entity69 , on administrative leave , and said it is in the process of firing her and her associate			0
@entity80 declined to comment , saying she 's still a state employee			0
' give up ' : dr. @entity146 told prison officials they should n't worry about hunger strikes because the inmates will often ' give up ' and start eating the internal investigation found that @entity146 and @entity109 did n't check on inmates as they should have during routine visits			2
the report also documented multiple communication problems among medical staff and allegations that other nurses were intimidated by @entity109 , a contract staffer who works for @entity211 , @entity213 - based @entity212			0
phone and email messages left with the company seeking comment from managers there and from @entity109 were not returned			0
@entity146 said the @entity166 used @entity17 's death as an excuse to fire him so that @entity212 could fill his $ 164,554 - a - year job more cheaply			1
since firing @entity146 last month , the state has given the @entity166 's medical chief , @entity224 , direct oversight of medical care at the penitentiary			0
the state has also hired the company on a one - year contract worth $ 14.8 million to provide nurses for all 12 of @entity5 's prisons			2
' i never saw this guy , never met him , ' @entity146 said of @entity17			0
' i was convinced it was a way to get rid of me			0
i was told i should have known about it			0
' @entity146 , who maintained a private practice in @entity238 , a town of 2,500 , while he was in charge of health care at the nearby penitentiary , did n't address the state 's claims directly , saying only that he was on vacation when @entity17 died and did nothing wrong			2
it 's not the first time his work has been called into question			0
the doctor has been sued in federal court 103 times since 1992 by inmates and their attorneys			0
while many of the lawsuits filed were dismissed , @entity146 reached an undisclosed settlement with the family of one inmate who died after @entity146 repeatedly diagnosed him as faking illness			0
@entity261 district judge @entity260 , in declining to dismiss the family 's lawsuit against @entity179 , wrote that the attention paid to the inmate 's medical complaints was ' so cursory as to amount to no treatment at all			2
' the @entity5 attorney general 's office criminal review of @entity17 's death is ongoing , @entity270 , a spokesman for attorney general @entity271 , told the @entity0 once the investigation is complete , corrections officials will decide whether to file complaints with the licensing boards overseeing the doctors and @entity109 , department spokeswoman @entity272 said			1
' we are still reviewing all possibilities , which is one reason we asked an outside agency to look at our investigation in order to see if any other actions were warranted , ' @entity272 said			0
@entity17 , a heating and air conditioning repairman by trade , had no family or friends visit him at the prison , and no one claimed his remains			2
