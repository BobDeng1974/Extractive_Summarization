by @entity0 published : 10:11 est , 28 october 2013 updated : 05:34 est , 18 november 2013 his internationally renowned ' @entity2 ' diet has picked up a host of celebrity fans , from supermodels @entity6 and @entity8 , to actor @entity9 and @entity12 's secret model @entity10			1
and now fitness guru - to - the - stars @entity15 has updated and re-released his healthy living plan for everyone on @entity18 this month , promising to banish yo - yo dieting forever and give you the streamline body of which you 've always dreamed			1
and for @entity23 readers , @entity15 has filmed a series of exclusive exercise videos , each targeting a specific problem area , just for us			1
last week @entity15 revealed how to get the bottom you really want , and this week tummies are under the spotlight			1
scroll down for exclusive video @entity34 model @entity10 is a staunch supporter of @entity15 's @entity2 diet plan in today 's short video , @entity15 reveals three exercises which he promises will give you a flat tummy			1
the wood chop is one of his favourite exercises , a ' big bang ' exercise that uses pretty much every muscle in your body			1
it involves swiping your clenched hands in outstretched arms from left to right , down to up			2
the plank helps improve posture and strengthen core muscles by working and switching on abdominals			0
the tummy vacuum is ' a great way of connecting your brain to your tummy muscles ' , by teaching them to work properly			0
it helps you engage muscles in the stomach properly			0
the three exercises are easy - to - do and can be carried out anywhere at any time			2
and although it 's loved by supermodels , @entity64 girls and film stars , @entity15 says that the real magic is that is can work for anyone , from housewives to office workers and everyone in between			1
@entity10 met @entity15 several years ago and is such a fan that she penned the introduction to his book @entity2 : @entity77			1
@entity10 said : ' @entity15 knows exactly how i want my body to look : lean , taut and strong , yet soft , curvy and feminine			1
' what i 've learned through working with @entity15 is that by focusing on creating a healthy body you can really achieve all of these things , faster than i ever thought possible			1
oh , and by the way , nobody can get a stomach as flat as @entity15 can ! ' @entity10 said : ' @entity15 knows exactly how i want my body to look : lean , taut and strong , yet soft , curvy and feminine ' common sense : @entity15 's @entity2 plan is loved by supermodels and anyone who wants to detox and tone up the diet has never been advertised , but those who follow it ( and who follow @entity15 's workouts , which he teaches from his @entity97 gym @entity98 , recently voted as best in the business by @entity100 ) become enthusiastic to the point of fanaticism , making the @entity2 plan popular through word of mouth alone			1
it recommends fresh food , as close to its natural state as possible			0
no refined sugar , which @entity15 describes as like a ' toxic fat bomb ' for your waistline			1
cut back caffeine to one cup of coffee in the morning			0
rely on natural , nutritious foods to give you energy rather than a roller coaster of unnatural highs provided by sugar and caffeine that invariably end in a crash that will have you reaching for the next stimulant , whether that be coffee , carbs , sweets or wine			0
and yes , ditch the booze			0
fans : @entity130 , supermodel @entity10 has been following the @entity2 plan for some years now , while right , @entity34 model @entity8 is also a fan in his new book , @entity15 explains that he came up with the term ' clean and lean ' to describe the ' ultimate approach to achieving the perfect body			1
the word ' clean ' here means a body that can deal effectively with toxins - one that can deal with few that sneak in ( via a glass of wine or a chocolate bar ) and flush them out successfully			1
' in his years of studying nutrition , says @entity15 , he has discovered that while you can live off processed low - fat food and diet colas for a while your body will be so toxic that you 'll find it hard to keep the weight off			1
' people come to me who have tried every single diet out there , yet they ca n't stay slim for long			2
' they cut carbs , they count calories , they ban whole food groups and they spend their lives weighing and measuring out food , ' he says			0
' but this type of dieting is a complete waste of time : it might help you to drop a dress size or tighten your belt for a while , but you 'll gain it back eventually because your body will still be toxic and it 's unsustainable - who wants to live like this ? ' and so the cycle of dieting , feeling miserable and deprived , losing and gaining weight continues			1
' instead , @entity15 says we should enjoy our food , but make sure that rather than processed foods , we eat healthy , natural foods and avoid ones laden with sugar			1

or for @entity185 readers at $ 9.56 on @entity186 clean foods are those that : it 's not just the wrong type of food that piles on the pounds			2
the relentless , low - level stress of everyday life can also add inches to your waist			2
when we 're frightened , angry , tense or worried our bodies become flooded with adrenalin and a stress hormone called cortisol			0
the adrenalin keeps us alert and focused , while the cortisol prepares our muscles for a ' fight - or - flight ' response			2
does stress leave you feeling fat ? it also helps the body to release sugar into the bloodstream for instant energy			2
it 's all part of a defence mechanism that allows the body to respond appropriately when faced with danger			2
while this stress mechanism worked well for us when we were cavemen , modern - day stress , caused by a relentlessly busy lifestyle , is really bad for you			0
it makes you fat , it wears out your immune system and it increases your risk of serious illness			0
this is because many of the situations that cause stress nowadays do n't present the sort of physical danger that you need to run away from			0
the result is that fat - storing hormones - and the sugar they help to release into the bloodstream - float around your system , eventually ending up as fat on your tummy and around your waist			0
they also make you crave more sugar because your body thinks it needs more to keep going			0
as stress levels subside , your adrenalin levels fall , but cortisol ( and the resulting blood sugar ) stays in the system much longer			0
research shows that fat cells around the stomach attract cortisol , giving you a layer of toxic fat just below your abdominal muscles that 's really hard to shift , so doing regular sit - ups is pointless if you always feel stressed			1
and stomach fat is the most dangerous type because it raises your risk of heart disease , high blood pressure , diabetes and certain cancers			0
constant stress also shuts down the digestive system because your body redirects blood from there to your muscles			0
so stress can leave you constipated , bloated and toxic			0
beating stress is the only way to better health and a better body			2
