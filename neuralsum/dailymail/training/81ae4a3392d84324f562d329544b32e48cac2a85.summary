the shameful tactics used by one of @entity3 ’s biggest payday loan companies can be exposed by @entity4 today			0
an undercover investigation into high street chain @entity7 – which claims to be ‘ a responsible lender ’ – reveals how it preys on vulnerable customers and cash - strapped families , locking them into spiralling debt			1
a mail on sunday reporter , posing as a trainee manager , worked in one of the company ’s 496 branches where he secretly filmed staff describing the firm ’s heartless tactics			1
the @entity7 , which turned over £ 374 million last year and whose adverts are fronted by celebrities such as @entity42 football manager @entity41 , claims it offers loans for everyday emergencies ,			1
but our investigator watched as a stream of customers , often on benefits , asked to borrow as much money as possible			0
demanding : @entity51 , 22 , is the company ¿ s area manager for the @entity54 of @entity55			2
she sent out emails last week to @entity58 staff at the @entity60 store ordering them to sign up more customers for payday loans @entity63 admitted that they knew many of the people would use the cash for drink or gambling			1
concerned about the number of people visiting the branch who smelt of alcohol , our reporter asked his boss , manager @entity16 , what the company ’s policy was on handing them loans			1
@entity16 replied : ‘ that is ok in this place or we would n’t serve half our customers otherwise			2
i ’ve never not served anyone			0
’ last year the firm promised to clean up its act after staff were seen leafletting benefits claimants , even stopping mums with prams in the street			1
but our reporter , based at the @entity60 branch in @entity98 , observed staff canvassing the high street			2
one worker admitted during a previous sales drives they had been ordered to target council estates			1
he said : ‘ when i was training we had a map			0
so you get a particular area where we would give leaflets to – blocks of flats			0
’ the controversial company also came under fire last year after it chased a desperate father - of - two for repayments and even took money from his bank account as he lay in hospital after a failed suicide attempt prompted by his mounting debts			1
our investigator filmed as one member of staff explained how this ruthless practice , known as ‘ swiping ’ , works			1
the technique is allowed as long as the salesman has got the customer to sign a continuous payment authority , giving the company power over their bank account			0
the salesman boasted : ‘ say the loan is £ 220 and they ’ve only got £ 50 in their account			1
consequently you ’ll get customers coming in and saying , “ you ’ve taken this much out of my account and i ’ve got to feed my kids			2
” ’ his reply ? ‘ sorry madam , this is our right			2
you should n’t have taken a loan , should you ? ’ the archbishop of canterbury @entity144 weighed into the paydoay loans controversy last year , promising the @entity147 would try to help borrowers itself			1
politicians and regulators have sworn to clamp down on the sector and on friday the @entity25 published ‘ get tough ’ rules			1
chain : the company turned over £ 374million last year and claims to be a responsible lender that is dedicated to helping people in financial difficulties customers can borrow a maximum of £ 1,000 for 30 days at a rate of £ 29.99 for every £ 100 borrowed			2
if they borrow £ 1,000 , they will owe £ 299.90 at the end of the month			0
if the customer can not repay in full they are encouraged to pay the interest and roll the loan over			2
the following month they do the same , so each month they pay almost £ 300 in additional fees			0
the annual percentage rate ( @entity170 ) is 3,873 per cent			0
the regulations , which come into effect on april 1 , will require lenders to make proper checks that borrowers can afford the loans ; limit how often loans can be ‘ rolled over ’ to just two ; limit the use of the continuous payment authorities and require lenders to help customers who ca n’t repay to find free advice services			1
our investigator found rolling over debts was rife at @entity186			0
on thursday , the day before dozens of loans were due to be repaid , the store received £ 23,000 for customers it expected to roll over their debt			2
@entity16 said : ‘ we ’ve just had £ 23,000 delivered today			0
the way they ( the company ) look at it is we ’ve got 48 people who are going to pay all their loans off then they ’ll all be back again to reloan			1
’ on several occasions our reporter observed customers being offered rollover loans , even if they had defaulted			1
some had been borrowing for as long as 18 months and had received more than a dozen consecutive loans			0
the reporter watched people on benefits being given approvals in minutes			0
even if they failed the credit check they were encouraged to sell or pawn gold and mobile phones for cash instead			1
@entity16 told our reporter : ‘ if a customer comes in and the loan declines , you say , “ well do you have any unwanted gold or phones ? you do n’t need no credit rating for that			1
” ’ the company then offers paltry prices for valuable goods worker @entity221 said : ‘ for an @entity225 4s they ( the company ) will take £ 20			2
you ’ll find customers are so desperate they ’ll take it			0
‘ the question is how did they get it ? is it really theirs or have they stolen it ? a lot of the customers , i ’ve thought , “ that ’s not their phone they ’ve stolen it			1
” but you ’ve got no way of proving it			0
’ staff are under huge pressure to sell loans			1
@entity51 is area manager for south - east @entity55			0
the 22 - year - old pressured staff to drum up business last week , demanding they improve the amount of loans they were issuing			2
one email to the @entity60 store said : ‘ still on zero ? ! change this now please ! ’ @entity255 mp @entity254 , who has led the campaign for payday loan companies to have tough restrictions , said : ‘ @entity260 ’s investigation has found does n’t surprise me because i ’ve been warning about the techniques of these companies for years			1
‘ once you are on their list you are absolutely hunted down and squeezed dry			0
these practices are completely unacceptable			0
this is an industry which is full of bad practise			0
the conduct of these companies is beyond the pale			0
’ last night a spokesman for @entity186 said it was investigating @entity260 ’s findings			2
they added : ‘ our focus has to be on treating our customers fairly and lending responsibly			0
if it were found that a small number of individuals are not following the strict policies and processes in place to protect our customers , then that is something we would immediately address			0
