by @entity1 reporter published : 19:02 est , 17 march 2013 updated : 02:40 est , 18 march 2013 patients could be charged £ 8.50 to call an out - of - hours doctor to their home under controversial plans outlined today			1
the sick could also be forced to pay for their hospital meals or increased charges to watch television on @entity11 wards			1
the proposals are being floated as a way of tackling the ‘ unprecedented financial dilemma ’ faced by the @entity15			0
controversial : patients could be charged £ 8.50 to call an out - of - hours doctor to their home under plans outlined today ( file picture ) but campaigners expressed outrage at the ‘ frank discussion ’ document , saying it undermined the founding principle of the @entity11 that care must be free at the point of use			1
they also warned that seriously ill patients could be discouraged from seeking treatment if they feared being unable to afford the fees			1
the @entity31 , which represents all @entity15 trusts , devised the ideas as ways of generating extra funds			1
chief executive @entity36 said : ‘ we need to talk openly and honestly about why our @entity15 needs to change			0
we can not risk the wheels coming off and patient care suffering			0
‘ the @entity11 is facing severe pressure on its finances			1
we need to have a frank discussion about the road ahead			0
’ the report makes it clear that the @entity11 is under dire financial strain thanks to the soaring costs of caring for an ageing population			1
food for thought : the sick could also be forced to pay for their hospital meals or increased charges to watch television on @entity11 wards ( file picture ) there are also rising numbers patients suffering illnesses caused by obesity and alcohol abuse			1
this already totals £ 17.9billion a year and is expected to rise even further			0
last night @entity64 , chief executive of the @entity65 , said : ‘ calling out a doctor or having a meal in hospital are key tenets of an @entity11 which is free at the point of use			1
some of these proposals amount to what would effectively be a “ patients ’ tax ”			2
‘ it would be absolutely unacceptable for patients to foot the bill for reform through new charges			0
’ @entity81 , a @entity82 health spokesman , said : ‘ long - term efficiency savings are not being made			0
‘ instead , the @entity11 is cutting the “ low - hanging fruit ” , such as staffing , with serious consequences for patient care			2
‘ the government should take heed of this advice from the @entity31			2
’ pressure : @entity31 chief executive @entity36 said that a frank discussion was needed as the @entity11 faces severe pressure on its finances any fees would apply to everyone over 18 who has basic health insurance – around 90 per cent of the population			1
but surveys have found 27 per cent of patients would delay calling out a doctor and 18 per cent would avoid it altogether if they had to pay			0
however , some trusts are already considering imposing a £ 10 - a - day fee to watch tv			0
last year , an @entity11 trust went into administration for the first time and officials estimate there are around 20 more in severe crisis , with combined debts of about £ 130million			2
the costs of propping - up private finance initiative deals will worsen the position even more in the next decade			0
now , the @entity11 spends £ 1.5billion of its annual £ 100billion budget on these but this is set to double in the next decade , warned the report .			2
