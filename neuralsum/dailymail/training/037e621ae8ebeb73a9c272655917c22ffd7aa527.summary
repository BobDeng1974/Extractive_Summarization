by @entity0 published : 10:47 est , 18 october 2013 updated : 13:33 est , 18 october 2013 a council has spent £ 10,000 on a new bus shelter - only to see the bus service scrapped weeks later			1
the brand new stop replaced an old one in @entity6 on the route of the hourly number 14 service			1
but three weeks after appearing bus company @entity9 slashed their service and now the stop is only used twice a day			1
the shelter has been branded ' a ridiculous waste of money ' because it has no regular bus service residents are furious after the @entity9 bus company withdrew the number 14 from the stop after just a few weeks local resident @entity20 , 78 , said : ' i think it 's ridiculous			1
i 'm a pensioner and i pay my council tax and then they waste money like this			0
' a lick of paint would have done for the old bus stop but instead they put a brand new one			2
' we were able to use it for all of three weeks before the number 14 was taken off			1
' local councillor @entity35 said : ' it 's not a great use of public money to spend it on a brand new bus shelter that is n't going to be used as a bus shelter - it seems fairly pointless to me			0
' cllr @entity35 waiting for a bus at the new bus shelter in @entity44 , @entity6 @entity45 , @entity46 's project delivery manager , blamed @entity47 and said the shelter could be moved - at a further cost of £ 1,000			2
he said : ' we carried out considerable liaison with the county council 's passenger transport services and service providers as part of this project			0
' if decisions are subsequently made to cut services then this is outside of our control			0
' this bus stop was also in the worst condition of all city council - owned shelters across the city			0
' of course the shelter could be relocated in the future at minimal cost , which i would estimate at less than £ 1,000 , should the need arise			0
