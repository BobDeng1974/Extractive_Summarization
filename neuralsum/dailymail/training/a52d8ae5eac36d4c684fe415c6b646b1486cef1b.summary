top @entity1 football clubs are set to lobby for the @entity2 in @entity3 to take place in may , according to reports			2
the @entity6 , an umbrella organisation representing the interests of 214 teams from the continent , is a powerful voice in the ongoing negotiations around when the tournament will be scheduled			1
and the group , which counts 10 @entity15 clubs among its number , is reported to favour may , a stance it will be able to present to the sport ’s world governing body @entity22 at a calendar task force meeting next month			0
@entity24 ( centre ) suggested a winter @entity2 in @entity3 , which is unpopular with leading clubs in @entity27 a traditional mid-summer competition appears to have few supporters , with heat and humidity in the @entity33 state reaching levels that could compromise the safety of players and spectators			2
bringing the event forward to january or february has its supporters but a clash with the @entity41 presents a potentially insurmountable obstacle			0
another alternative , apparently favoured by @entity22 president @entity24 , would see the @entity2 take place in november and december , when the climate would be more suited to football			1
but that would represent a huge disruption to many domestic leagues , a prospect that could wreak havoc with @entity1 structures - effectively splitting the 2022 - 23 campaign in two as well as having a knock - on effect to future seasons			1
now it seems @entity6 , formed in 2008 and backed by the power of @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 as well as the likes of @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and both @entity66 clubs , will push for its own vision			0
emir @entity68 holds the @entity69 after the 2022 tournament was awarded to @entity3 an artists impression of the @entity72 , one of ten being built for the @entity3 2022 tournament may temperatures would still be stifling , but unlikely to be significantly higher than those experienced in @entity80 ( 1986 ) , the @entity75 ( 1994 ) or @entity76 and @entity77 ( 2002 )			1
the stadium cooling technology @entity3 have long promised will be available could also come into play in such circumstances			0
a task force , featuring a wide variety of stakeholders , will have its next meeting in november before recommending a preferred timetable to @entity22 ’s executive committee next year .			0
