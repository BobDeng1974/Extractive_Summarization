but @entity5 has other ideas			2
he has turned two giant pumpkins into sea - going craft as part of a world record quest			0
one , weighing 800lb , has been covered in plywood , had the seeds scooped out and an engine fitted so the 27 - year - old artist can attempt to cross from @entity15 to the @entity16 tomorrow			1
this is the craft in which he hopes to set a world record for the 100 - metre dash today at @entity27 in @entity21			0
yesterday , when he launched the giant vegetables , mr @entity5 – who has never sailed before , nor climbed aboard a pumpkin – was delighted they did n’t just sink			1
keep it steady : mr @entity5 's hollowed - out pumpkin is lowered gently into the water ahead of the attempt first crossing : mr @entity5 wants to be the first person in history to cross the water in a hollowed out pumpkin journey : the pumpkin will be floated from @entity21 to the @entity16			1
@entity5 will also making an attempt at a record tomorrow when he tries to be the fastest to paddle 100 metres in a hollowed out pumpkin after being shown which way round a paddle goes , he was upbeat about the chances of setting the 100 - metre record , for which there are no known precedents			2
the sprint must be completed in under three minutes but all he has to do for the @entity19 crossing tomorrow is get there			0
he is chirpily confident he can cover the three - and - a - half - mile trip in ‘ a few hours ’ in his adapted vessel			1
daring : the giant pumpkin will be fitted with a small two - stroke petrol engine for the crossing , which will enable it to travel at two knots - or 2.3mph gently does it : mr @entity5 tries his craft out in the water off @entity27 , @entity21			1
giant pumpkins are naturally buoyant and have a thick , waterproof exterior tow : mr @entity5 said it was his first time in a boat he said : ‘ the purist in me just wanted to stick an outboard motor on the pumpkin and go , but the experts told me i ’d never make it over the first big wave			2
' i ’m actually not a very good swimmer			0
’ the artist , who is filming his voyages to present as an artwork , has at least resisted the temptation to carve a face on the pumpkins , or put a candle inside			0
another world record : mr @entity5 is attempting to set a new record for the fastest 100 metre paddle in a hollowed out pumpkin making waves : mr @entity5 , at @entity27 , @entity21 , trials his pumpkin craft prior to his attempt to cross from @entity21 to the @entity16 on dry land : the huge pumpkin is moved into position ready for the world record attempt			1

@entity5 will try to complete the four - mile journey in three hours
he will travel from @entity15 , @entity98 , to @entity99 , on the @entity16
mr @entity5 , from @entity101 , @entity102 , said he is ' pretty confident '
