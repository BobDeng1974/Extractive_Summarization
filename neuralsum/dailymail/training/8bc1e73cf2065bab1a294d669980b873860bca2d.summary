by @entity0 i do n't know about you , but when the sun 's out and the mercury is rising , my inclination is to go make - up free			1
i like to feel the sun on my skin ( i 'll be wearing sunscreen , natch ) and to take advantage of the vitamin d boost i get from its rays			0
there are summer occasions , however , that demand a properly made - up face			2
so this week i 've called on the expert help of the fabulous @entity17 – make - up artist extraordinaire and all - round beauty guru – to conjure the perfect summer party look			1
' it 's the ideal time of year to experiment with bright make - up colours – they never go out of fashion , ' explains @entity17			1
the look i 've chosen focuses the bright colour on lips and cheeks , paired with smoky party eyes			2
gorgeous ! ' begin with a light base like @entity45 for a fresh , dewy finish – or if your skin 's a bit more blemish - prone , opt for a foundation with a bit more coverage such as @entity53			0
the eyes draw your eyeliner pencil along the upper lash line			0
@entity17 used black , but you could try purple , dark green or inky blue for an added hit of colour			2
look out for a waterproof eyeliner pencil ( especially in the summer months when it 's hot and sticky ) as this will help the lock the colour in place – try @entity53 ' excellent @entity68			0
draw the colour from inner to outer corners of your eyes , and then along the lower lash line , extending out into a flick			0
you can also try a liquid liner such as @entity78 for a more defined winged effect			0
@entity17 recommends only a light dusting of blusher for the summer months @entity0 says she likes to be bare - faced during the summer months but there are a few occasions when you need to be made - up - a summer party being one now take @entity88 's @entity87 in @entity89 , a luscious golden hue , and draw it along the water line to make your eyes really pop. finally , volumise upper and lower lashes with a coat of @entity97 mascara			1
the cheeks ' my go - to summer colour for @entity0 is my @entity101 in @entity102 , ' reveals the make - up artist			1
' you only need the tiniest bit of this brilliant liquid blusher , blended onto the cheek bones with a wide , flat brush , and the colour will last all night long			0
' if you 're a bit more daring with your make - up , try the @entity112 in the vivid orange trip shade for a super-cool rave - style look			1
@entity17 has created a look that is n't too clogged with make - up so that your skin can still breath in the summer months a lip stain is great for when it 's hot as it is n't as sticky as a high shine gloss the lips you can also use @entity17 's @entity124 on your lips as a lip stain , simply dabbed on with your fingertip			1
it 's simple , easy and super-effective			0
thanks @entity17 ! you can pick up @entity17 beauty products – and tons of other amazing beauty treats - at online boutique @entity133			2
the great thing about this look is that it does n't use too many products and is quick to apply - so my face does n't feel heavily clogged with make - up and yet i look glam enough for a special summer party			1
now all i need is an exciting invitation and i 'm good to go ! until next week , stay beautiful			0

@entity0 loves a bare face for summer but says you need make - up for parties
