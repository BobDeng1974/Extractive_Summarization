by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 from getting lost on the @entity2 to badly chipping his tooth on a baguette to making miraculous mid-match recoveries from injury — strange things tend to happen to @entity9 at the @entity10			1
nothing , however , could top the tale of the unexpected that would be reaching the final at the expense of @entity16 , the man who has only ever lost one best - of - five - set match on clay out of 89 played			1
without a head coach and largely scratching around for form prior to the event , @entity9 must defeat not only the eight - time champion , but also the opponent who has proved the most formidable obstacle to his ambitions at @entity26			1
ahead of friday 's semi-final , @entity40 champion @entity9 was honest enough to admit : ‘ i ’d rather it was someone else than @entity16 , but it ’s a great opportunity for me to go out there and play a great match and see if i can beat him			1
’ there had been plenty of drama even prior to wednesday night ’s extraordinary late win over @entity53 , with the marathon against @entity55 and beating @entity56 despite letting slip 15 break points			0
that , coincidentally , was the number that he had when he met @entity16 in the semi-finals here three years ago in going down in straight sets			2
it showed that he is easily capable of creating opportunities against the greatest ever clay court player			2
braveheart : @entity9 lets out a roar after his quarter - final victory over @entity53 on wednesday @entity9 did so again three weeks ago when he led the @entity35 4 - 2 in the decider of the @entity73 quarter - final : ‘ i did n’t win but maybe if i had won a few more matches in the build - up it could have helped , ’ he said			1
‘ i ’m in a good position right now			0
i would have signed up for this			0
‘ the hunger is there			0
i believe 100 per cent i can beat @entity16 and @entity81 ( @entity82 ) , but on this surface it ’s harder for me than other courts because it ’s not my best and they are two of the greatest clay - court players			1
‘ it was hard for the two or three months after @entity40			0
as soon as i had the surgery and made that decision , motivation was n’t an issue for these events			0
i had no days off for three months getting ready for the @entity95			0
i did n’t need to do that			0
close - run : @entity9 shakes hands with @entity16 after their @entity100 @entity10 quarter - final in @entity73 last month ‘ a lot of players have surgery and take three or four weeks off but i trained every single day to get ready to get myself in shape and i am seeing the benefits of doing that now			1
’ @entity9 needs a big win against one of his main rivals — he has not beaten a top - 10 player since @entity40 and only @entity111 from the top 20 — to authenticate the claim that he is properly back			2
as @entity113 said on thursday : ‘ playing @entity16 in the semis — it ’s “ now let ’s see how far he is going to go here ”			2
’ words of wisdom : @entity16 speaks with coach and uncle @entity120 ( left ) during a practice session in @entity29 on thursday far from @entity126 ’s absence being a handicap , it is starting to look an advantage in some ways with @entity9 taking responsibility for himself in a sport which always boils down to self - reliance			2
his success of the past 10 days makes it far less likely that he will bring a new coach in before @entity40			0
@entity9 and @entity16 have the closest thing to a genuine friendship between the established stars of the men ’s game , but theirs is also the most statistically one - sided rivalry with the @entity35 ahead 14 - 5			1
history suggests it is difficult to see that improving in the @entity145 ’s favour on friday			0
respect : @entity9 lost to @entity16 in three sets in their last semi-final clash at @entity10 in 2011 @entity149 plays @entity82 , making the tournament ’s special guest appearance among the ‘ @entity152 ’ in the semi-finals , and he has earned it			1
it helps that the 18th seed cares little for reputations , and his frank discourse on life and tennis after every match leaven the stolid fare generally served up by his peers			0
what will serve him best on friday is his outstanding backhand among other things , and if @entity82 slips up in any way then the colourful @entity167 is the kind of free spirit who will happily take advantage			2
fired up : @entity173 takes on @entity82 in the first semi-final at @entity10 on friday			1

@entity16 has only ever lost one best - of - five set match on clay out of 89 played
the world no 1 is an eight - time champion at @entity10
@entity9 took @entity16 to three sets at the @entity73 last month
the @entity35 leads the head - to - head record 14 - 5
@entity82 faces @entity149 in friday 's first semi-final
