by @entity0 parents should tell their children they love them every day to help make them more ready for learning at school , according to new advice from head teachers			1
families often assume their sons or daughters feel loved but they need to hear the words frequently to boost their self - esteem			2
they should also praise youngsters by repeating phrases such as ‘ you are learning fast ’ , ‘ that was a kind thing to do ’ and ‘ keep working on it , you ’re nearly there ’			0
parents should tell their children they love them every day to help make them more ready for learning at school , according to new advice from head teachers ( file picture ) the recommendations are contained in a leaflet , your child ’s wellbeing : a short guide for parents , issued by the school leaders ’ union , the @entity31 and the @entity33 charity			1
but education campaigners have condemned the advice as ‘ nanny state meddling ’ , insisting that parents do not need ‘ patronising ’ reminders from head teachers about how to speak to their children			1
the leaflets are being distributed to @entity31 ’s 28,500 members who will share them with parents at their schools			1
they are the fifth in a series produced by the @entity31 and @entity33 , with other topics covering literacy and numeracy and speaking and listening			1
the latest top tips for parents include trying to be a ‘ positive role model ’ by not shouting or swearing in front of children and establishing boundaries to help them ‘ feel safe ’			1
they should praise their child ’s efforts as well as achievements , for example telling them they ’ve done well for trying hard and that it ’s okay to make mistakes			0
when their son or daughter does something wrong , they should ‘ tell them , but focus on their action and how to do better next time ’			0
a section on raising self - esteem adds : ‘ when things are difficult help your child to see it as part of life and learning and that it happens to all of us			0
teach your child not go give up and to keep trying			0
@entity84 , @entity31 president , said : ' if children feel happy and healthy at home then they come into the classroom free from worries and ready to learn ' ( file picture ) ‘ listen to your child and show them you value their views and opinions			1
’ other tips include encouraging children to eat a balanced diet , bake and help prepare family meals and exercise vigorously for at least 30 minutes each day			0
the leaflet suggests getting out and about as a family , playing tag in the park or going on a bike ride together			1
saying ‘ well done ’ will encourage children to ‘ learn that taking on challenges and making mistakes is an essential part of learning ’			0
under ‘ emotional well - being ’ , it adds : ‘ tell your child that you love them every day ’			0
but @entity112 , a former head teacher and chairman of the @entity114 , said that ‘ 99.9 per cent of parents ’ do n’t need that reminder and ‘ instinctively ’ say such things			2
he said : ‘ head teachers need to trust parents more			1
mostly parents do n’t need that sort of advice			1
it ’s nanny state , it ’s interfering , it ’s patronising and it ’s unnecessary			0
‘ it ’s almost discouraging parents from following their natural instincts and doing what ’s right			2
by saying ‘ we ’re taking over ’ , you ’re going to undermine parents and probably damage the children			2
‘ it ’s yet another example of the state or the profession ’s failure to understand that people do n’t need to be told the obvious			0
it ’s distrustful in that sense			0
’ but @entity84 , @entity31 president 2013 - 14 , said : ‘ modern life is so highly pressured for parents that it can be easy to forget to do the little things that can make a real difference to a child ’s self - esteem			1
‘ for instance , sometimes we assume our children know that we love them but children need to hear the words			0
- ‘ listen to your child and show them you value their views and opinions ' ‘ if children feel happy and healthy at home then they come into the classroom free from worries and ready to learn			0
i believe parents are the best partners schools can have in helping pupils make the most of their education			2
’ she added : ‘ the leaflet tells about the importance of helping a child persevere with tasks and reassuring them that it is ok to make mistakes			2
trying out some of the suggestions can go a long way to giving children a sense of wellbeing which will give them a good starting point for school life			0
’ @entity183 , chief executive of @entity33 , said : ‘ if the practical advice in this simple leaflet makes a parent pause just for a second and reflect on the wellbeing of their child then it will have done a good job			1
’ * three - quarters of 1,018 parents surveyed by the @entity31 believe that introducing ‘ too much change into schools too quickly ’ damages their children ’s education .			1

parents also advised to be ' positive role models ' and to lead by example
