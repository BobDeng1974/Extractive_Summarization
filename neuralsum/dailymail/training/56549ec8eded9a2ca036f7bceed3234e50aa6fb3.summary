as a result of her condition , @entity23 , from @entity36 , @entity37 , suffers shortness of breath , chronic bronchiectasis ( a disease of the lungs ) and has a defective heart valve			1

i have n’t had the easiest time but with the help of my family and friends i ’m determined to get on with life			1
' i love seeing my friends and my birthday was brilliant			1
i just try to take life one day at a time and dealwith it as it comes			2
' you have down days and up days , but the down days are a few more at the moment as i wait for the lung transplant			0
caring : @entity23 with her mother @entity28			0
as a result of her condition , the teenager also suffers shortness of breath , chronic bronchiectasis ( a disease of the lungs ) and has a defective heart valve ' there are worse off people than me though , so i just want to help the @entity81 help other people			1

defiant : despite doctors ' expectations , @entity99 , who is waiting for a double lung transplant , turned 16 this week ' i stood in the hospital after they told me to ' listen to my doctor and just give her @entity106 ' and said to the nurse that if i did n’t get a second opinion i would stand there and scream			2
' a young doctor said he would have a look and shortly after he sounded an alarm and she was rushed into surgery			0
' they told me she had bad pneumonia and needed emergency surgery within minutes or she would die			0
' ever since she has been in and out of hospital every few months			0

all the children from her school turned up and she had a fantastic time			0

@entity8 - @entity7 has a condition so rare that doctors named it after her

doctors warned her parents she would n't live past her second birthday
instead of 16th birthday presents , she asked friends to donate to charity
