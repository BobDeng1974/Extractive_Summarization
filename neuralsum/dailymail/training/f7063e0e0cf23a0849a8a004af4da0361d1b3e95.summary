' @entity36 freaked out and that made all the other children run in the bathroom - they have all seen it and are traumatised now			2
' mr @entity27 dialled 999 just before 5.30pm on saturday , july 26 , and was told by the operator to clamp his wife 's stomach together until help arrived			1
' @entity6 was literally sitting there , holding the wound together with her bare hands , ' he said			2
' we were later told there must have been an infection in the wound which is why it had n't healed			0
' the 41 - year - old taped the wound but the ambulance did not arrive at the couple 's @entity22 home until 7.06pm - an hour - and - a - half later			1
during that time , the family rang 999 for an hour and were reassured that despite it was a busy saturday evening , help was on its way			2
' i was asked " can you see the intestines ? " i said " i do n't know - i 'm not a doctor , all i can see is lots of red tissue " , ' he told @entity33			0
' i was told , rest assured , help was on its way			0
' mr @entity27 said : ' @entity6 was literally sitting there , holding the wound together with her bare hands ... i wanted to drive @entity6 to hospital myself , but she was worried about being moved with the wound split open			1
' mr @entity27 claims he was told their call was classified as non-urgent by ambulance operators mr @entity27 was also told to take his wife to lie down , because she had started to feel sick and dizzy due to the searing pain in her abdomen			1
mrs @entity6 underwent the hysterectomy on july 16			1
' the surgeons seemed happy afterwards , ' said her husband			0
but the couple were unhappy that mrs @entity6 - who takes 51 different pills every day for her various conditions - was not allowed to self administer them in hospital			2
she discharged herself on the friday , a day earlier than advised by doctors , and returned to have the stitches out on the saturday			0
an hour after getting home , her stomach burst open			1
her husband recalled : ' we got home about 4pm and an hour later , @entity6 went to the loo before she went to bed			1
it was then that everything happened			0
in statement , @entity109 ( @entity110 ) , told @entity33 : ' i can confirm that we were called at 17:30 on 26 july to an address in @entity22 to a 999 call			1
' we are now reviewing the call and are therefore not able to comment further until thereview has been completed			0
' we are already in contact with the patient and their family and it is regrettable that on thisoccasion we did nâ€™t arrive at the patients side until 19:06			0
' we take our response to our patients very seriously and we would like to take theopportunity to wish the patient a speedy recovery			0
' a spokeswoman for @entity128 said : ' all issues and concerns raised by patients , families and visitors very seriously and all complaints are seen and responded to by our chief executive			0
' we have met with ms @entity6 and / or her partner on a number of occasions to listen to their concerns and explain the care and treatment given			0
' we have also apologised for the communication problems they experienced			2
' ' in the end , i ended up trying to hold the wound together with medical tape - the white stretchy stuff you might put over a plaster			1
' after three calls to the ambulance service , mr @entity27 said he was becoming infuritated			1
' i wanted to drive @entity6 to hospital myself , but she and my father - in - law were worried about moving her with the wound split open , ' he said			1
' they basically convinced me otherwise , ' he told @entity33			0
' when the ambulance driver turned up , he seemed bemused that i was so angry			0
he said he only got the call 13 minutes before			0
' mr @entity27 claims the call had been marked as non-urgent by the @entity161			1
' how can a call be non-urgent when they asked me if i could see my wife 's intestines ? , ' he said			2
' there were no sirens , nothing , when they turned up			0
one of the paramedics said they were " disgusted " at the fact they had only just got the call			0
what if she had deteriorated ? we could have lost her			0
' he added : ' looking back , they did have to dig really hard to get the stitches out - and yanked them out - i 'm not sure if that contributed			0
' he said that because mrs @entity6 , who relies on a wheelchair and crutches , is physically disabled , the surgeons agreed to remove all the stitches in one go rather than two stages , as they do normally			0
' we trusted the doctors and throught it would save to - ing and fro - ing , ' mr @entity27 said			1
he said the stitches that burst , were the external ones , not the internal ones holding her stomach together			0
when mrs @entity6 was admitted to @entity22 and @entity196 the family said it was was another four hours before they were seen by a doctor			2
the wound was bandaged with a special plaster and doctors prescribed antibiotics , but told the family the wound could not be sewn up because mrs @entity6 was suffering an infection			2
three weeks on from her ordeal , and mrs @entity6 , who is disabled due to fibromyalgia , a condition which causes pain all over the body , restless leg syndrome and @entity213 's disease , is finally healing			2
but mr @entity27 is furious at the ' unnecesary pain and trauma ' his wife has been through			1
' we do n't blame the hospital - we just do n't understand why the ambulance took so long and then why it took so long for @entity6 to be seen in hospital , ' he said			2
the couple are now considering legal action .			0
