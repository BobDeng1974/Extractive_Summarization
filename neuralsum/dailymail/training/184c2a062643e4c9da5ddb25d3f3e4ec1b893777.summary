astronomical : one call to a 118 directory inquiries number had been charged at £ 5 a minute looking through my latest mobile phone bill , i almost had a cardiac arrest			1
it was three times the usual amount — all thanks to one item			0
a call i ’d made to a 118 directory inquiries number had been charged at £ 5 a minute			1
and because i ’d then got them to put me through , the total cost of the 26 - minute call had come to £ 137.08 , including vat			1
spluttering with shock , i contacted @entity16 , my mobile phone service provider , and asked how on earth they could justify this			2
a very apologetic lady explained that i had called ‘ the wrong directory inquiries number ’			1
maybe i ’m naive , but i had n’t been aware that there could be a ‘ wrong ’ directory inquiries number			1
she explained that instead of calling @entity16 ’s own service on 118 881 , i had called the directory of @entity27 — another service provider — on 118 000			1
i explained that this was a totally innocent mistake			0
i had probably done so because i had dialled out of habit , having been an @entity27 customer some years ago until i switched to @entity16			2
i ’d been looking for the number of @entity35 customer services because my parents ’ digibox had developed a fault on @entity39			0
in any case , how is anyone supposed to accurately remember all these 118 inquiries numbers when they ’re all so similar ? of course , with hindsight , i realised that i could have scribbled down the number , hung up , and then dialled it myself			1
that way i would have been charged at a standard call rate when talking to @entity35			2
but when in a hurry or on the move , it can seem so much easier just to be put straight through			0
the woman at @entity16 sounded very sympathetic			2
she said she understood my distress but , unfortunately , @entity27 had charged @entity16 an inflated price and so @entity16 had to pass the cost on to me			1
if i had rung @entity16 directory inquiries on 118 881 , it would have been 71p a minute			1
there did n’t seem to be any way of arguing with this			0
so i sighed , thanked her and resolved never to call a 118 number again , just in case i got the wrong one			2
but something was still nagging me , so the next day i decided to call @entity27			0
they were adamant that the £ 5 a minute was nothing to do with them : they had not set the high charge for my call , @entity16 had			1
@entity27 ’s charge for their directory service was £ 1.29 a minute , they said			1
in other words , the true cost of my call to @entity27 directory inquiries was nearer £ 34			1
so , with a bit of mental arithmetic , i worked out that when @entity16 charged me £ 137.08 for calling a rival firm ’s directory , they had made a pure profit on that call of almost exactly £ 100			1
yet @entity16 continued to insist the £ 5 a minute charge was not their fault			1
i asked them how much they had profited from my call			0
a spokeswoman said : ‘ we pay the service provider ( @entity27 directories ) according to commercial agreements and we can not share this information			0
’ over the next few days , i went back and forth between @entity27 and @entity16 , repeatedly being told by both that the charges i had incurred were the fault of the other			2
by now it was n’t the size of the astronomical bill that i was angry about , it was the childish , manipulative and downright disingenuous behaviour of the phone companies			0
while @entity16 appeared to be the culprit in this case , i started to suspect that they were all in this together , setting complicated pricing structures that were impossible for the consumer to interpret			2
when i looked at @entity16 ’s website , there was a list of their charges for 118 numbers but there was no mention of what they charged for @entity27 ’s 118 000			1
the biggest charge they admitted to was £ 2.71 a minute if a @entity16 customer rang @entity113 ’s 118 500			1
complex : when @entity16 charged £ 137.08 for calling a rival firm ’s directory , they had made a pure profit on that call of almost exactly £ 100			1
yet @entity16 continued to insist the £ 5 a minute charge was not their fault so i contacted @entity16 ’s head office and said i was giving them one last chance to come clean about whether £ 5 a minute was their standard charge for a call by their customers to @entity27 directories			1
and , if it was , where was this charge published , as the industry regulations require ? and at that point , the firm admitted : ‘ we ’re very sorry , but £ 5 a minute is our charge			1
we do n’t know why you were told it was n’t			0
it must have been human error			0
’ at last ! it had taken me two weeks to establish who had really profited from my call to 118 000			2
a spokeswoman for @entity27 — when i eventually got hold of them — said : ‘ it is the carrier ’s decision on what rates they set			2
in this case , @entity16 has set the rate at £ 5 for a call to the @entity27 118 000 directory inquiries for its customers			1
we can confirm that this is not the rate set by @entity27			0
’ @entity16 charges for @entity16 directories 118 881 — 85p per minute for @entity27 directories 118 000 — £ 5 a minute for ‘ the number ’ 118 118 — £ 3.25 a minute for @entity113 directories 118 500 — £ 2.71 a minute @entity27 / @entity156 charges for @entity27 directories 118 000 — £ 1.29 a minute for @entity16 directories 118 881 — £ 1.80 ( to get a number ) then £ 1.20 a minute if the call is connected for 118 118 — £ 2.25 a minute for @entity113 118 500 — £ 1.80 a minute @entity161 charges for @entity161 ’s own service 118 180 — free ( up to ten calls a day ) for @entity27 directories — price not listed for ‘ the number ’ 118 118 — £ 2.57 for @entity113 directories 118 500 — £ 2.39 a minute only the most persistent person — one like me — would have bothered getting to the bottom of this scandal			1
but what chance does the average customer have of being able to navigate such a system ? in fact , the 118 system is so complex and so complained - about that the regulator @entity174 is set to overhaul it			1
from july , phone companies will not be able to hide their 118 charges as easily , or levy complex rates where the true cost to the consumer is hidden			0
a big part of the problem is that there are two different elements to these calls : the cost that all the different directory inquiry companies , with their own call centres often in different countries , charge you for their services ; and the cost your phone provider , like @entity16 , charges you to access them			1
at the moment , if you unwittingly dial the wrong number and use a directory service which is n’t your own phone provider ’s , that second element — the ‘ access charge ’ — can be extortionate			2
and , as i found out , it is very difficult to find out how much it is			0
but , under the new rules , phone companies will have to publish prominently what you have to pay , and furthermore , the extra charge will have to be exactly the same for all the different directory inquiry services they allow you to access			0
the idea is that if customers know and understand what they are being charged , competition will drive the cost down			0
they will have to make it clear , for example : ‘ calls cost 1.20p per minute plus your phone company ’s access charge			0
’ i ’m still not convinced this is simple enough for customers to find out the total cost of the call as it will appear on their bill			0
after all , you would still need to contact your provider or check your contract to ascertain the access charge			0
but @entity174 insist it will be an improvement			0
if so , then it is about time			0
the 118 swindle is all the more disappointing for the customer because the proliferation of these phone firms was supposed to be a great liberation of the market and drive down prices			0
but as with the electricity and gas firms , deregulation has not brought the promised savings			0
in fact , if anything , it has allowed the phone companies to drive up prices			0
indeed , it makes one long for the old days when there was just one @entity113 number to dial for directory inquiries			1
when that old 192 number , costing a mere 40p a minute , was abolished in 2003 and the industry opened up to competition , 118 was made the new prefix for all the new services			2
those who worked for @entity257 ( @entity174 ’s predecessor as regulator ) , which brought in the change , would no doubt now claim this was a mistake rather than a conspiracy			2
perhaps no one could have envisaged how phone companies would exploit the system			0
in practice , though , it has meant that customers have ended up so confused about which 118 number to dial without racking up enormous charges that , increasingly , they have had no choice but to avoid all of them			0
no wonder the number of calls to directory inquiries has fallen by an estimated 80 per cent in a decade			1
an @entity174 spokesman said : ‘ we want to make the cost of calling 118 numbers clearer for telephone users			1
under the changes which come into effect this summer , call charges will be split so consumers can compare the cost of calling different 118 services , and see where their money is going			2
’ even so , trying to tie down who is responsible for charging what for which service , with prices changing all the time , remains virtually impossible .			0
