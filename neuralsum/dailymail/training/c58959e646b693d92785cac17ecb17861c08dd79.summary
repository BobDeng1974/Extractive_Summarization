click here for more from our brilliant @entity1 , including this graphic of @entity5 's opening goal for @entity6			1
he is the lesser known @entity8 but it is @entity10 and not @entity11 who is making a name for himself in @entity14			0
the 25 - year - old sits joint top of the goalscoring charts following his match - winning double against @entity6 in @entity19			1
there he resides alongside more illustrious names such as @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25			0
but the muscular , pacey frontman – with an eye for goal to boot – might just be plying his trade in @entity31 as well next season should his @entity34 scoring spree persist			0
currently on the books of @entity37 in @entity38 , there has been talk of interest from abroad and such speculation is sure to amplify given his man - of - the - match performance to keep alive his nation ’s hopes of progression to the knockout rounds			0
booked : @entity79 , @entity88 , @entity5 @entity49 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity97 6.5 ; @entity98 7 , @entity99 6.5 , @entity100 6.5 , @entity101 7 ; @entity102 6.5 , @entity103 6.5 , @entity104 6 , @entity105 7 ( @entity106 90 ) ; @entity8 8 , @entity107 6.5 ( @entity108 82 ) subs not used : @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity101 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity85 , @entity116			1
booked : a @entity8 , @entity117 , @entity105 man - of - the - match : @entity51 * @entity1 ratings by @entity120 and @entity102 , of @entity121 , might just deliver a glowing report when he returns to @entity124 shores of the team - mate who now has seven goals from 12 international caps and was on target during the 2 - 1 defeat to @entity130 in their group opener			1
the marksman scored in either half to complete a come - from - behind victory and move @entity49 second in @entity137 behind @entity138 , who they face in @entity140 on wednesday			1
both @entity49 and @entity6 had drawn with @entity142 in pre-tournament friendlies in @entity144 and , to borrow horse - racing parlance , that form had hardly been franked by the subsequent performance of the @entity147 in @entity14			1
but amid the blood , studs and thunder of a predictably feisty affair , there was also a healthy helping of @entity155 flair			0
@entity49 were first to threaten when @entity105 lashed a low ball across the face of goal and only the out - stretched gloves of @entity57 denied @entity107 a routine tap - in			2
@entity6 defender @entity79 saw yellow after just six minutes for a wild swipe which felled @entity105 with the striker poised to level on goal			1
@entity51 did manage to escape the cynical attention of the @entity167 backline when scampering clear on 20 minutes but the forward snatched at the opportunity and lobbed wide			2
the blonde - haired , black - bearded @entity79 was never far from the thick of the action and the centre - back should have opened the scoring on 27 minutes , somehow heading wide when unmarked and connecting with a corner - kick just eight yards from goal			2
clean strike : @entity6 ' @entity5 ( left ) scores the opening goal of the game with a powerful effort back of the net : @entity49 keeper @entity97 can only watch as @entity5 's shot beats him pure joy : costly slides on his knees to celebrate scoring @entity6 ' first goal of the @entity34 mobbed : costly and his team - mates celebrate in front of the travelling @entity6 fans at the @entity188 @entity49 striker @entity51 saw plenty of the ball outside of @entity6 ' penalty box , as his heat map below shows - click here for more in our @entity1 but it was @entity79 who turned provider for @entity5 to open the scoring just after the half - hour mark			1
his long punt downfield was misjudged by veteran @entity201 and @entity5 made him pay , pouncing on the loose ball before drilling home in authoritative fashion from 18 yards			2
it was @entity6 ’ first goal at the @entity34 in 32 years and sparked belief that a maiden victory at the finals could be in the offing			2
their lead , however , was to last just three minutes and @entity8 made it two for the tournament with a close - range stab after @entity98 ’ shot was deflected into his path			0
@entity79 sought to restore @entity6 ’ advantage and he stung the palms of @entity219 with a fizzing free - kick in first - half injury - time			2
there was still time for @entity5 to crack the post with a header before the break and strike partner @entity88 was booked when he followed up to bundle into the net with his arm			0
costly missed the finals four years ago because of injury and he bore the look of a man with some making up to do , the 31 - year - old ’s rising drive drawing a flying save from @entity97 within 30 seconds of the restart after half - time			0
no way through : @entity6 defender @entity78 ( centre ) slides in to block @entity107 's effort ( left ) crowded out : @entity6 ' @entity240 ( right ) slides in on @entity49 winger @entity105 ( centre ) full blooded : @entity103 of @entity49 ( front ) goes in hard on @entity6 ' @entity244 acrobatic : @entity6 's @entity244 ( right ) pulls off an overhead kick to clear the ball from @entity248 ( left ) up for the cup : @entity250 kept their hopes of qualification for the last 16 alive with this win in @entity19 at the other end , @entity107 paid the price for his honesty when refusing to tumble under the clumsy challenge of a sliding @entity259 inside the area			1
sadly , @entity262 referee @entity261 chose not to reward the former @entity264 frontman and the chance was gone			0
but any injustice was soon forgotten when @entity8 climbed to cushion @entity101 ’s enticing free - kick into the bottom corner for his second of the night and third of the finals			0
he was denied a hat - trick late on when @entity57 repelled his curling free - kick , but his name had been noted nonetheless			0
controversy : @entity78 appears to catch @entity107 with a tackle inside the box but no penalty was given going down : @entity107 hits the turf after @entity78 's risky tackle during the second half animated : @entity6 boss @entity283 crouches as he dishes out instructions to his players rough landing : @entity49 winger @entity105 ( centre ) is launched into the air after a challenge by @entity78 ( left ) battle : @entity79 ( left ) tussles for the ball with @entity49 's @entity51 ( right )			1

@entity5 gave @entity6 the lead in 31st minute
@entity306 *replied* with quick equaliser before heading winner in second half
