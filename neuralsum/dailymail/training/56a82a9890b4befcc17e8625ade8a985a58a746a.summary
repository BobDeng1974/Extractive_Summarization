four overs later @entity46 ' replacement @entity56 ( 10 ) joined him after @entity55 took an easy catch running in from mid-on off @entity61 's bowling , while @entity62 ( 12 ) was next to lose his wicket cheaply when he was bowled by @entity36 to leave @entity5 82 for three			0

@entity85 joined @entity78 at the crease but @entity22 failed to claim his hat - trick and @entity78 ( 27 ) was bowled out by @entity61 , before @entity85 ( six ) fell lbw to @entity22 and @entity88 ( six ) was caught by @entity89 at the boundary off @entity48 to leave the @entity5 struggling on 144 for eight			2
but an impressive ninth - wicket stand of 71 from @entity38 ( 39 ) and @entity92 ( 29 ) saw them rack up a respectable total before the former - who hit four fours from his 37 balls - became @entity48 's second victim , caught at long on by @entity55			0
in response @entity3 began to get some massive runs on the board , despite losing @entity102 early for just seven			0

but fellow opener @entity13 ( 51 ) and @entity9 steadied the ship with a second - wicket partnership of 98 to bring @entity3 to 112 before the former lost his wicket - also caught by @entity62 at cover - off @entity56			2
@entity61 ( six ) joined @entity9 at the crease but he only lasted five overs before he was bowled out by @entity38 after chopping the ball onto his stumps leaving @entity3 needing 92 runs with 23 overs remaining			1
captain @entity25 ( 57 not out ) took to the field and built up a fourth - wicket partnership with @entity9 ( 96 ) , who scored eight fours and one maximum from his 99 balls but lost his wicket in the penultimate ball of the match , caught by @entity38 off @entity88 , as between them they put on 91 and saw @entity3 past their target to 221 for four to claim the victory			2
