by @entity0 published : 15:58 est , 14 september 2012 updated : 04:42 est , 15 september 2012 it is sometimes easy to forget that the @entity2 was n't born into royal life , such is the composure with which she fulfils her new role			1
her coolness yesterday , despite the turmoil going on around her , was truly remarkable			0
it was around 8pm @entity11 time on thursday that news broke of @entity15 magazine closer 's decision to publish topless pictures of @entity2 on holiday in @entity18			1
the initial reaction from royal aides at @entity35 was cautious			0
could the magazine be bluffing to beef up its readership ? were the pictures even real ? when @entity40 and @entity2 rose around 6am in their suite at the high commissioner 's residence , it was up to their private secretary , former @entity47 officer @entity45 ( backed up by @entity2 's girl friday , @entity49 , and their press secretary @entity50 ) to break the distressing news over breakfast of coffee and fresh fruit			1
the couple were shocked , horrified even , but remarkably calm			2
they agreed with their private office 's suggestion to wait and see what the magazine had actually done			1
even at this early stage , however , the similarities to the life of his late mother were almost too much to bear for @entity40			0
' this incident turns the clock back 15 years , ' said a source close to the future king			0
following the initial discussions there was little time for the royal party to dwell on the pictures			0
this was one of the busiest days of their nine - day tour on behalf of the @entity79 , with a visit to the @entity81 in the centre of the @entity84 capital			1
they had obligations to fulfil			0
looking eerily reminiscent of her husband 's late mother , whom she has always spoken regretfully of never having had a chance to meet , the @entity2 stepped out of her official car dressed in a pale grey dress and matching scarf by ethical label @entity93 , run by the couple 's great friend @entity95			1
looking eerily reminiscent of her husband 's late mother , the @entity2 stepped out of her official car dressed in a pale grey dress and matching scarf there was time for a giggle together as the royal couple sat down on chairs to remove their shoes by the time the couple made their way to a colourful cultural display at a central city park it was becoming clear the pictures did indeed appear to be genuine there was even time for a laugh and giggle together as the royal couple sat down on chairs to remove their shoes , @entity40 struggling with his hand - made brogues as @entity2 kicked off her favourite @entity120 nude heels and sat waiting in her stockinged feet			1
it was the first time that either of them had visited a mosque and they appeared genuinely interested in what they were being shown			0
@entity2 even let slip that her father - in - law , prince @entity127 , who takes a particular interest in the @entity130 faith , had given then something of a crash course			1
behind the scenes , however , talks were already beginning between @entity135 and @entity136 as to how to tackle the scandal best			0
by the time the couple made their way to their next appointment , viewing a colourful cultural display at a nearby park to the cheers and screams of thousands of well - wishers , it was becoming clear the pictures did indeed appear to be genuine			1
yet still @entity2 remained calm			2
having by now shed her veil – displaying an intricate bun dotted with pearl - headed pins – she threw her head back and plunged into the crowds , shaking hands , exchanging pleasantries and accepting flowers			0
the couple went to a tea party at the @entity160 where among the celebrated guests were @entity84 - born shoe designer @entity163 and she failed to bat even an eyelid when , as they left , an overenthusiastic fan lunged in through the open door of their car to take a picture before being dragged off and handcuffed by police			2
even when the pair went on to a business lunch , where @entity40 gave a speech , they appeared to be a couple without a care in the world			0
it was only in the privacy of their suite , as they changed afterwards in preparation for their fourth engagement of the day , that @entity2 's composure momentarily crumbled as she was shown the pictures that had by now hit the streets of @entity136			1
@entity40 was said to be equally shaken			0
the intrusion quickly brought home the worst excesses of the paparazzi when his mother was alive			0
the @entity127 has done everything in his power to protect @entity2 from the same form of scrutiny and he quickly instructed his spokesman to make clear that their initial sadness had turned to anger and disbelief			2
' we believe a red line has been crossed and we are consulting with @entity15 lawyers to see what , if any , action can be taken , ' the aide said			0
arriving at the city 's airport a few minutes later for a flight to @entity215 where they still had two more scheduled engagements before the end of the day ¿ the pair were struggling to hide their anger with the support of his wife , father and the @entity79 @entity40 issued a statement condemning the photographer and magazine 's ' grotesque and totally unjustifiable ' invasion of their privacy @entity232 not to disappoint their hosts , the couple went on to their next engagement , a tea party at the @entity160 where among the celebrated guests were @entity84 - born shoe designer @entity163 , who waxed lyrical about the @entity2 's beauty ' both inside and out '			1
dressed in an ice blue lace dress by @entity242 , @entity2 's performance was as engaging as ever			1
in fact it was @entity40 – glowering every time he saw a photographer and constantly chewing his lip – who appeared to be feeling the strain			0
within minutes of their departure he instructed his press team – with the support of his wife , father and the @entity79 – to issue a statement condemning the photographer and magazine 's ' grotesque and totally unjustifiable ' invasion of their privacy and indicating they would leave no stone unturned in seeking redress			1
arriving at the city 's airport a few minutes later for a flight to @entity265 – where they still had two more scheduled engagements before the end of the day – the pair were struggling to hide their anger			2
yet again , however , @entity2 's composure still shone through			1
she offered a small smile to waiting newsmen and , as the couple boarded their @entity277 - 800 jet , she reassuringly placed her hand on the small of her husband 's back			2
