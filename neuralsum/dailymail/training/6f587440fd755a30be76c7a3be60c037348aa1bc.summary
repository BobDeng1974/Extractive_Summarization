@entity0 has the third most valuable squad at the @entity2 at his disposal , yet they are only joint eighth favourites to win the trophy			1
despite having an estimated insurable value of £ 550million , more than top favourites @entity5 ( £ 448.3m ) and @entity6 ( £ 355.2m ) and almost three times that of @entity8 rivals @entity11 , not many people think @entity13 have a realistic chance of winning the tournament			1
@entity16 , who conducted the study with the @entity19 ( @entity20 ) , predicts the most expensive team , @entity22 , will lift the @entity2 at the @entity23 on july 13			1
it showed @entity13 ’s players are worth on average £ 23.9m – which is more than the whole of @entity8 rivals @entity49 ’s squad combined ( £ 18.3m )			2
@entity50 and his ageing @entity11 team - mates come in at 10th on the list , while @entity53 , who many tip to be the tournament ’s surprise package , are 23rd with a group value of £ 72m			2
@entity59 striker @entity24 is @entity13 ’s highest paid player after signing a new contract worth £ 300,000 - a - week earlier this year			0
the collective value of the 32 teams at the @entity2 is an estimated £ 6.2billion			0
price tag : @entity65 of @entity66 is one of @entity68 's most valuable commodities double figures : @entity50 , @entity70 are just 10th on the list @entity5 @entity72 28/1 @entity22 possess the most valuable squad ( £ 641m ) , no doubt helped by the likes of @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 , while reigning champions @entity66 , with @entity79 , @entity65 and @entity80 , are second at £ 591m			1
the hosts @entity5 might be favourites with the bookies to win the tournament but their squad is only the fourth most valuable , according to the report			1
the research suggests @entity88 , which features @entity22 , @entity26 ’s @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 , is the toughest group in the competition with a combined value of £ 1.2bn			2
@entity95 man : @entity89 talisman @entity26 helps @entity88 along the way to becoming the most expensive easy task : @entity98 have the easiest job on their hands in @entity102 with @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 @entity98 should have the easiest job of qualifying for the last 16			0
@entity108 ’ team , which includes @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 , has an average player value of £ 17.2m			0
compare this with the other nations in @entity115 ( £ 6m ) , @entity104 ( £ 2.1m ) , @entity105 ( £ 1.5m )			0
@entity116 from @entity16 ’s @entity5 said : ‘ it is incredible to see how much some of the teams playing in @entity119 are worth – the top three , @entity22 , @entity66 and @entity13 - are worth more than £ 1.7bn collectively			1
this is more than the bottom 20 teams combined			0
‘ the predicted insurable values also clearly show which groups should be trickier to qualify from than others – and it ’s far from a level playing field			0
