by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 23 march 2013 updated : 17:04 est , 23 march 2013 author and playwright @entity1 created his best - known character , @entity4 , to entertain the offspring of friends who lived near him in @entity8			1
when the five little @entity10 boys were orphaned in 1910 , @entity1 became their unofficial guardian and each summer took them on holiday to @entity13			1
the sumptuous @entity15 manor is on the edge of @entity17 , in picturesque sheep - farming country in @entity19 , @entity20			2
in an idyllic echo of @entity22 , @entity4 ’s home , @entity1 and the youngsters would fish in the @entity25 below the house or play croquet on the lawns			1
and in the evenings , @entity1 would direct the children in plays			1
grand : @entity33 , returned to its @entity15 splendour and on the market for £ 675,000 , is where @entity4 author @entity1 would spend his summers now , the scene of those blissful holidays – or at least the major part of @entity41 – is up for sale , with a price tag of £ 675,000			1
in the @entity46 , part of the house was converted into three two - bedroom flats , leaving the remaining , larger part with six bedrooms , three grand reception rooms and ten acres of land running down to the river			1
by the mid-nineties , the house had been empty and decaying for almost a decade and was bought by a local builder , who set about restoring it			2
‘ halfway through the work , however , his wife thought there was a ghost in here and said she would never move in , ’ says current owner @entity57 , 62			0
‘ so we bought it ten years ago for £ 450,000			1
‘ it ’s not haunted			0
in fact , it ’s the friendliest house we ’ve ever lived in , ’ says @entity4 , who runs a storage business in @entity67			1
his wife @entity71 , 58 , says : ‘ it was a wreck when we moved in			0
one of the tanks had leaked upstairs , so all the centre of the house was black with mould			0
it ’s been a real labour of love , but we ’ve done it before in previous houses and have a passion for it			0
’ conversion : the owners spent ten years restoring @entity84 from top to bottom , so it now reminds of the days of @entity1 's holidays great rooms : @entity13 has six bedrooms , three reception rooms and ten acres of land running along the nearby river tradition : the drawing room with original part - stained - glass windows @entity97 hills : @entity4 and @entity98 are selling @entity100 holiday home @entity13 , on the edge of @entity17 , @entity20 the couple bought the whole building , so started living in one of the flats , which had been modernised , and began work			1
‘ we ’ve done it all very sympathetically and spent about £ 150,000 , ’ says @entity4			1
‘ we had to put in new electrics and plumbing and new bathrooms , but we put everything else back as it was			0
the previous owner had replaced the roof , the guttering and the chimneys to a really high standard – we just had to do the interior			0
’ the drawing room , with its delightful part - stained - glass windows , was used for tea dances 70 years ago , and now the couple use it for their own parties			0
‘ it ’s been quite a society house in its day and is great for entertaining , ’ says @entity71			0
‘ it ’s also handy for town – the theatre ’s within walking distance – and there are good schools nearby			0
’ inspiration : @entity1 writing at his desk in @entity134 - but it was in @entity136 he spent his summers , imagining the adventures of @entity4 fun and games : author @entity1 playing croquet at the hall with one of the @entity10 boys who inspired him to write @entity4 in spite of its name , @entity17 is old : the @entity148 had a garrison here and drovers brought sheep to the market for centuries , until its recent closure			1
@entity156 opened her first shop 20 miles away in @entity158 and the firm ’s headquarters are in @entity17			0
the result of @entity4 and @entity163 ’s efforts is splendid and faithful to the original , with ornate plaster ceiling cornices and roses			2
but the real grandeur of the house lies in the scale of its rooms and their views , as well as a dramatic spiral staircase in the entrance hall			2
the large reception rooms are a particular delight and the main sitting room , with its beamed ceiling , panelled fireplace and dark wood floors , is evocative of its era			1
while the new kitchen is not particularly big , it could easily be doubled in size by knocking through to the utility room behind			0
there are also cellars , a study and four bathrooms			0
‘ we did n’t know very much about @entity1 when we came here , but it ’s become a very important part of owning this house , ’ says @entity4			1
‘ we breed dressage and showjumping horses and need more land , ’ he explains			2
‘ we ’ve bought some land in @entity199 and we plan to build a house there when this is sold			2

@entity1 's holiday home in @entity136 is on the market for £ 675,000
