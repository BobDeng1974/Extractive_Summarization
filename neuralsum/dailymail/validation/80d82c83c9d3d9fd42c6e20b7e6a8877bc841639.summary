@entity5 , 43 , was left with a paralysed face and in agonising pain after being bitten by a tick while gardening in september last year			1
she is pictured with daughter @entity22 , 21 ms @entity5 remembers being bitten on her hip but thought nothing of it			1
days later , she suffered flu - like symptoms which became worse until she was in agony after carrying out tests , doctors discovered the mother - of - two had developed @entity29 , a bacterial infection spread to humans by infected ticks			1
she was prescribed antibiotics and underwent months of physiotherapy to help strengthen the muscles in her face - and is now telling her story to warn others of the dangers of tick bites			2
on the day she was bitten she had been wearing jeans and a baggy jumper , which she believes the tick must have become caught in			1
ms @entity5 , from @entity42 , @entity43 , said : ' i was in agony			1
the bites themselves were n't itchy or painful , so i did n't think they were the cause at first			0
' i 'm quite an active person and just put the aches and sharp pains down to my body being worn out			0
' she began suffering flu like symptoms and went to @entity55 , when the pain in her hip and back became so severe she could hardly move			1
lyme disease is a bacterial infection spread to humans by infected ticks			1
it is is the most common tick - borne infectious disease in the @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68			1
@entity69 estimates there are 2,000 to 3,000 cases of @entity29 in @entity69 and @entity72 each year , and that about 15 per cent of cases occur while people are abroad			1
ticks are tiny arachnids found in woodland areas that feed on the blood of mammals , including humans			2
tick bites often go unnoticed and the tick can remain feeding for several days before dropping off			0
the longer the tick is in place , the higher the risk of it passing on the infection			2
cases of @entity29 have been reported throughout the @entity66 , but areas known to have a particularly high population of ticks include @entity92 , the @entity93 in @entity94 , the @entity95 and parts of @entity97 and @entity98			1
they are also found in parts of @entity101 and @entity102 , @entity103 in @entity104 , the @entity105 , the @entity106 and the @entity107			2
lyme disease can cause problems with a person 's skin , joints , heart and nervous system			0
it is treated with antibiotics			0
source : @entity118 she was treated for pressure sores with codeine and paracetemol , before being sent home with crutches			0
the pain became increasingly worse , but she did n't want to burden her family and so tried not to complain			0
she said : ' i tried to hide the pain from my kids as i did n't want to worry them , but it was getting harder to put on a brave face ' ' i had to quit my job as a cleaner as i just could n't work , i was in that much pain			1
' it got so bad , my daughter called an out - of - hours doctor who visited me and gave me a morphine injection for the pain			0
' just days later , ms @entity5 woke to find she 'd lost feeling in both of her cheeks			1
she could barely open her mouth to speak and found smiling or wrinkling her nose impossible			0
her gp performed a series of reflex test and diagnosed @entity146 â€“ a rare condition that causes temporary weakness of the facial muscles			0
there is no known cure for the condition , although most people notice an improvement in their symptoms after a few weeks			0
but six months on , ms @entity5 's face was showing few signs of improvement			1
' i was horrified that my face was paralysed , but even more so when my doctor told me that there 's no cure , ' ms @entity5 said			1
' i was told i could be paralysed for weeks , or even months			0
' ms @entity5 , who is a single mother to @entity164 , 21 , and @entity165 , 12 , was referred to hospital			2
she underwent blood tests and a lumbar punctures , which is where a needle is inserted into the lower part of the spine to look for evidence of conditions affecting the brain , spinal cord or other parts of the nervous system			0
it was then revealed ms @entity5 had been suffering from @entity29 - a bacterial infection spread to humans by infected ticks			1
when doctors gave the diagnosis , she suddenly remembered she had been bitten while gardening			2
ms @entity5 , pictured before her face became paralysed , woke up one day with numb cheeks and no movement in her face			1
it was then she was diagnosed with @entity29 she said : ' it was only then that i remembered the bites on my hip			2
i showed them to the doctors and they confirmed they were tick bites			0
' @entity146 can be caused by a viral infection , so suddenly all of the symptoms i 'd been suffering made sense			2
' lyme disease is the most common tick - borne infectious disease in the @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68			2
the ticks , which flourish in long grass or undergrowth , typically attach to deer but can also be found on foxes , badgers , mice , birds as well as domestic pets - responsible for carrying the ticks into urban areas - and humans			2
indeed , areas of undergrowth ( and that includes parks and gardens as well as woodland and open country ) are most likely to harbour ticks as they drop off their original hosts then climb to a point where they can latch on to other passing wildlife			0
cases of @entity29 have been reported throughout the @entity66 , but there are certain areas which are know to be tick hotspots			1
these include @entity92 , the @entity93 in @entity94 , the @entity95 and parts of @entity97 and @entity98			0
six months on , ms @entity5 is starting to see some improvements , although she is still in pain they are also found in parts of @entity101 and @entity102 , @entity103 in @entity104 , the @entity105 , the @entity106 and the @entity107			1
if left untreated , @entity29 can spread causing arthritis , heart problems , muscle pain and neurological symptoms such as paralysis			1
fortunately , ms @entity5 was treated with antibiotics and spent the next two weeks in hospital recovering			2
but even after fighting the disease , her face still remains paralysed			2
she said : ' it was awful			0
i was finally feeling better after getting over the @entity29 , but my face was still such a mess			1
i could n't even bring myself to look in the mirror			0
' whenever i caught my reflection , it was like a stranger looking back at me			0
i had no facial expression			0
' i suffered for months , until i finally started receiving physiotherapy to help speed up my recovery			0
' i 'm still not 100 per cent , but i 'm getting there now			0
my face muscles are getting stronger and i 'm slowly beginning to move them again			0
' it 's hard to believe that a few little tick bites caused so many problems			0
' i hope my story encourages people to take more care in their back gardens			0
who knows what 's lurking in your flower bed			0
