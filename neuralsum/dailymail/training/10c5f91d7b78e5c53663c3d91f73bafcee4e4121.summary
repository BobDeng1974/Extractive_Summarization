for several years , a £ 500,000 painting by an acclaimed artist had pride of place in the home of one of @entity7 ’s richest residents			1
@entity8 , 73 , wife of the billionaire founder of @entity11 , the world ’s largest recruitment business , displayed the oil on canvas @entity15 , 1907 in the hall of her @entity19 home			1
after all , it was purportedly signed by @entity22 painter @entity21 and was purchased from a company run by respected fine art dealer , @entity25			1
so you can imagine @entity28 - @entity8 ’s shock when one of mr @entity25 ’s staff contacted her to say the picture she bought in good faith for 670,000 euros in 2007 - £ 525,000 at current rates - was the work of one of the world ’s most notorious art forgers , @entity38 @entity35			1
fake : @entity15 , 1907 contained pigment patented 1938 , 31 years after it was purportedly painted the @entity22 - born philanthropist was outraged when mr @entity25 ’s aide then informed her that the case fell outside the statute of limitations and therefore his company had ‘ no liability ’ towards her , though they had a desire to ‘ act honourably and look to reach an equitable conclusion ’			1
no such settlement has been agreed , with @entity50 - a keen supporter of the @entity52 - ‘ very distressed ’ that she has not been offered a full refund			0
she has instructed top @entity56 law firm @entity55 to represent her in her legal battle with @entity59 dealer mr @entity25			1
the saga started in march 2007 when @entity61 , a collector of mainly 19th century art , bought ‘ @entity15 , 1907 ’ purportedly by @entity21 , and signed and dated ‘ @entity21 1907 ’			1
the painting was acquired for a purchase price of € 670,000 at the world famous @entity67 art fair from the @entity70 trading arm of @entity71 , known as @entity72			2
in may 2013 , @entity71 , through their @entity38 office in @entity75 , wrote to @entity50 saying that the painting would have to be shipped to @entity38 to be checked by a laboratory which had carried out chemical tests on other paintings thought to be the work of master forger @entity35			1
the crook was jailed for six years in 2011 after being found guilty of counterfeiting 14 pictures as part of an elaborate and skilful scam that netted him and his gang £ 14million			1
in 2012 , he sensationally admitted he may have placed as many as 2,000 bogus pictures by 50 different artists on the market			0
one such picture , was ‘ @entity15 , 1907 ’ - the one purchased by @entity50			1
in september 2013 , mr @entity25 ’s @entity38 office suggested in an email to her that – following chemical analysis of the painting - she had bought a fake			2
@entity35 was jailed for six years in 2011 after being found guilty of a £ 14million scam the email went on to say : ‘ the findings indicate that titanium white was used in a number of instances , making it impossible for the painting to have been painted before 1938 ( the titanium white used in the painting was sourced from rutile , a method that was patented by @entity107 in 1938 ; before that date titanium white in its pure form was only available from 1910 onwards , so either way , the presence of titanium white is a sign that the painting can not pre-date 1910 )			1
this strongly suggested that the painting we have analysed is indeed a forgery and most probably comes from the workshop of mr @entity35 ’			2
the following month @entity117 , managing director of @entity71 , wrote to her to say that as the case fell outside the statute of limitations , @entity118 had ‘ no liability ’ though they had a desire to ‘ act honourably and look to reach an equitable conclusion ’			0
according to lawyers representing @entity61 , mr @entity25 ’s firm have made it clear that they do not agree to her request for full reimbursement plus her legal costs			2
a friend said : ‘ @entity132 was very distressed and shocked to find out it was a fake and she expected that @entity25 would reimburse her in full , as the painting is not what he purported to sell her – it is in fact a forgery			2
@entity132 feels it is morally incorrect for him not to return the money in full			0
‘ he is a well - known dealer with a long career who surely should have done his due - diligence considerably better than he has as the painting has proven to be a forgery			0
’ added the friend : ‘ @entity50 has been put in the extraordinary position of effectively being asked to ‘ bid ’ against herself			0
@entity25 have refused to say what they would be willing to offer her and instead have asked her to put forward a figure herself - but less than the reimbursement of the purchase price plus her costs			2
’ a spokesman for @entity72 said : ‘ the context to this matter is that the main international auction houses and many other leading dealers were duped by this wide - reaching and sophisticated forgery ring			0
‘ at the outset @entity72 in @entity162 obtained confirmation from the worldwide @entity166 expert , @entity167 ( the author of the catalogue raisonné of the artist ) , that the painting was genuine			0
upon suspecting that this painting might possibly not be genuine , they approached @entity50 suggesting they investigate the matter on her behalf			0
‘ once it was confirmed by scientific analysis that the painting was a forgery , in a desire to act honourably despite the matter being outside the statute of limitations , they suggested over 14 months ago that they should meet to discuss how the position might be ameliorated , but were rebuffed			0
the matter has since been the subject of correspondence between the lawyers of the two parties			0
’ four years ago the @entity187 revealed that @entity25 expert @entity25 was at the centre of a legal wrangle concerning the commission on a £ 4.2 million @entity192 sketch			1
the case was finally resolved after a flurry of writs and years of litigation .			0

@entity8 , 73 , paid £ 525,000 for oil canvas @entity15 , 1907
art dealer said it was signed by @entity22 painter @entity21
but after tests it *emerged* it was a fake by jailed forger @entity35
he was jailed for six years in 2011 for his role in a £ 14million scam
the dealer , @entity25 , is not legally *obliged* to give the money back
