opposition to president @entity2 's nominee for @entity4 ambassador to @entity5 has grown in @entity6 to the point where @entity8 , @entity10 businessman @entity9 now says he does n't plan to pursue the job when the new @entity6 convenes in january			1
ambassadorial posts require @entity14 confirmation , and @entity9 's cringe - worthy performance in a january 2014 hearing virtually guaranteed that he would n't be getting a thumbs - up			1
@entity9 , chairman of @entity18 , is a major @entity20 fundraiser who plowed $ 267,244 into party coffers in 2012 – including $ 75,800 to the @entity2 @entity23 – and ' bundled ' $ 988,550 from his business connections to benefit @entity2 's re-election effort			1
he also donated $ 300,000 to @entity20 super pacs			2
during his @entity28 hearing , however , he bungled questions about @entity5 's political parties and spoke of the nation 's ' president ' – even though it is a constitutional monarchy with a king and a prime minister			1
' you get some fringe elements that have a microphone and spew their hatred , ' he complained			0
' and although i will tell you @entity5 has been very quick to denounce them , we ’re going to continue to work with @entity5 to make sure – ' a stunned @entity74 @entity73 sen. @entity73 interrupted @entity9 to remind him that the @entity55 was considered a mainstream political influence in @entity76			1
it 's actually the third - largest party in @entity5 's parliament , and its leader @entity79 is the country 's current finance minister			1
' the government has denounced them ? ' @entity73 asked			0
' they 're part of the coalition of the government			0
' ' well , i would say – you know what ? i stand , i stand corrected , ' a slapped - down @entity9 responded			0
that exchange came minutes after @entity73 asked : ' mr. @entity9 , have you been to @entity5 ? ' ' i have not , ' an ashen - faced @entity9 admitted			1
he told reporters in multiple statements over the weekend that senators would n't have him to kick around anymore			1
' i have elected not to renew my nomination for the next @entity14 session as i did last year , and will let the nomination expire , ' he said in one			2
with the ambassadorial slot left unfilled for more than a year , he said the elapsed time was ' too long not to have an ambassador in any country			0
' @entity103 's two @entity20 senators , @entity104 and @entity105 , were among the first to oppose his nomination			2
their state is home to large concentrations of @entity111 expats and multi-generational immigrants from @entity113 and @entity5			0
not @entity114 : newly confirmed @entity4 ambassador to @entity46 @entity116 is a soap - opera producer with no other discernible credentials really ? sen. @entity73 was shocked to hear @entity9 claim that a governing - coalition party in @entity5 was a hate - group that the @entity5 government had denounced ' it 's a tight community and we heard from them , ' @entity104 told @entity126 in june			1
' we want diplomats to be pretty good under pressure anyway and he seemed not to be and he displayed a tremendous amount of ignorance about @entity5			0
' cornered in june on the question of whether @entity9 and other apparently unqualified nominees should be installed in embassies overseas , @entity132 press secretary @entity131 signalled the @entity2 administration 's intention to stand firm			2
' we 've got full confidence in their ability to do these jobs , ' @entity131 said			0
' i think it is short - sighted to automatically rule out nominees that are n't career @entity147 officers			0
' ' if that were the case , that means that @entity151 would not be serving as the ambassador to @entity153			0
i think most people , even some republicans , would agree that she ’s doing a pretty good job over there			0
' but a group of @entity132 @entity20 and @entity154 insisted over the summer that @entity9 's ' embarrassing lack of knowledge ' about @entity5 made him unqualified			1
hotelier @entity9 flubbed line after line during his january @entity28 confirmation hearing , drawing eye - rolls from senators on both sides of the political aisle as he struggled to demonstrate why he should be @entity4 's ambassador to @entity5			1
here are the most memorable gaffes from his limited time on the international stage			0
' the answers provided by mr. @entity9 clearly demonstrate that he is unqualified for this position and may damage an important international bond if confirmed , ' wrote 32 lawmakers , including six @entity20 , many from the @entity175 , home to many @entity5 - @entity4			1
they said that in light of military aggression from @entity181 president @entity180 , it was critical for the @entity4 to have a knowledgeable and respected ambassador in a nearby nation like @entity5			2
' his ill - informed comments deeply offended several @entity5 officials and have caused many to doubt his ability to serve as an effective ambassador , ' the lawmakers wrote			0
in a separate statement , @entity190 @entity189 rep. @entity189 said @entity2 should do ' what is best for @entity5 and @entity4 , not what is politically expedient for his fundraisers and cronies			2
' in march the union that represents @entity4 diplomats threatened to sue the @entity198 unless it released documents attesting to the qualifications of @entity9 and other ambassadorial nominees			0
the @entity202 said it would ask a court to compel the production of the documents , known as ' certificates of @entity207 , ' if the department did n't cough them up voluntarily			0
the @entity202 claimed @entity198 had ignored requests to have the documents released under the @entity211			0
@entity9 's attempt to leap into foreign service from a political fundraising nomination was nothing new : past administrations have rewarded money - men and women with prime ambassadorships for decades			1
but president @entity2 has eclipsed both @entity220 , and @entity221 , in that regard , filling an estimated 37 per cent of his ambassadorial posts with fundraising rock stars and other political cronies whose qualifications have been called into question			1
collectively , they were responsible for at least $ 13.6 million in political donations			0
@entity76 mayor @entity229 responded to @entity9 's january implosion by telling @entity231 , in an @entity233 translation , that it ' would be very sad for @entity5 - @entity4 relations if the @entity5 people are made to feel like second - class citizens by getting an unprofessional ambassador			1
' he is surely a fine man and has surely done an excellent [ job ] for himself and for @entity2 's election campaign , ' @entity229 said			1
' but given what we saw from his hearing , he does n't seem very interested in @entity5			2
' a senior @entity132 official told @entity244 on monday that the administration has no plan for a new personnel announcement that might introduce a new nominee to replace @entity9 .			2

@entity9 appeared in a disastrous @entity14 confirmation hearing this year during which he admitted he had never been to @entity5
he was a major @entity20 donor and a ' bundler ' of donations for president @entity2 's re-election campaign
@entity9 said during his hearing that @entity5 has a president , not a prime minister
he *famously* cast an *anti-immigration* political party in @entity76 's governing coalition as a hate group , claiming the @entity76 government had *condemned* it
@entity9 told reporters over the weekend that he does n't plan to renew his *doomed* nomination when the new @entity6 convenes in january
