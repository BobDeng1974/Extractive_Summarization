by @entity0 published : 10:03 est , 28 may 2012 updated : 19:40 est , 28 may 2012 @entity2 , 59 , from @entity3 , near @entity4 , @entity5 , died after breathing in fumes from an airbag during a car crash in january 2011 , an inquest heard a husband involved in a minor car crash died months later after breathing in the ‘ noxious ’ contents of an airbag			1
@entity2 ’s wife june was relieved when he arrived home apparently uninjured following the six - car shunt , an inquest heard			1
however he told her the airbag had been torn open by a shard of glass as it inflated and he had inhaled the gases it contained along with a large amount of white powder			1
@entity24 mr @entity2 , a 59 - year - old marine engineer who had been extremely fit and active , began to suffer chest and breathing problems			1
after several weeks he went to hospital where he was placed on a ventilator			1
however , three weeks later mr @entity2 died of bronchial pneumonia			1
@entity5 coroner @entity30 recorded a verdict of misadventure on mr @entity2 , from @entity33 , @entity34			1
he said : ‘ this man died as a result of this incident ( the car crash ) and more pointedly because of the explosion of his airbag ... and exposure to noxious substances			1
’ outside court mr @entity2 ’s son , @entity43 , 36 , said : ‘ it ’s the verdict i was looking for			1
ever since it happened we wanted an investigation to see if anybody was to blame and i ’m happy with what the coroner has said			2
’ it is believed to be the first time a driver has died after inhaling the contents of an airbag , and mr @entity2 ’s widow spoke her shock and devastation that something designed to save life had actually taken it			1
‘ i knew from the very beginning that it was the airbag , ’ she said			2
the accident that led to mr @entity2 ’s death happened in november 2010 as he was returning home through @entity65			1
the @entity66 says when airbags ignite they produce nitrogen , which inflates the airbag and should not be hazardous ( file picture ) he drove into the car in front at the same time that another went into the back of his @entity76			1
his head was flung forward by the impact and he inhaled the contents of the torn airbag , the inquest at @entity34 was told			2
the @entity66 said the motoring organisation had no record of similar deaths			2
a spokesman said : ' in the event of a crash , sensors in a car , behind the bumper for example , measure the rate of deceleration			1
' if the impact is severe enough , an explosive device triggers the inflation of the airbag			2
in some systems a sodium azide tablet is fitted inside , and this is ignited electronically			2
' when it ignites it produces nitrogen , which inflates the airbag			2
nitrogen already makes up 78 per cent of the air we breathe so it ’s not hazardous			2
' as soon as the bag has fully inflated it starts to deflate - once it ’s taken the force			0
' a lot of powder is also released			0
this is mainly talcum powder , which manufacturers use as a lubricant to help the airbag slide into the correct position during assembly			0
' some systems use canisters of a cellulose - based gas to inflate the airbag , but this is n’t regarded as toxic either			1
we have checked our records and can not find any similar cases , but this death is very sad			0
' ‘ he told me about the white powder straight away , ’ said mrs @entity128			0
‘ he said there was so much of it he could n’t see			0
‘ i just thought that the white powder had got into his lungs			0
i thought his body would get rid of it by itself – i did n’t think it would be permanent			0
‘ not long after that i noticed that he was n’t right , he would become breathless walking up the drive			1
‘ @entity139 has never smoked so that was very worrying			0
he started to cough a lot as well			0
it was n’t normal because he was n’t like that , he never got colds			0
‘ he had always been so healthy and was extremely fit			0
i knew from the beginning that it was the air bag but other people would look at me as if to say , “ do n’t be silly ”			0
’ on january 5 the couple went to @entity149 and mr @entity2 was immediately given oxygen and admitted			1
‘ he could barely move , ’ added his widow			0
‘ it was a very cold winter , and he was really struggling			0
we used to walk everywhere and he was always out every night with the dog , but he got so bad that he could n’t even walk a few steps without my help			0
’ forensic pathologist dr @entity157 told the inquest that mr @entity2 ’s lungs were both extremely ‘ heavy and firm ’			1
the @entity66 said it had no record of similar deaths			0
a spokesman for @entity76 said the company planned to investigate the matter but did not wish to comment at this stage .			0

@entity2 died two months after car accident
his wife noticed his face reddened after breathing gas
