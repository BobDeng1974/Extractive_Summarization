by @entity0 published : 21:54 est , 24 july 2013 updated : 04:35 est , 25 july 2013 ' @entity1 ' : author @entity2 has spoken about the events surrounding the identity of the real author of crime novel @entity1 - herself author @entity2 has revealed she spent a week practicing the fake signature of her pseudonym , @entity1 - the name she used for her new detective novel			1
the @entity12 creator signed a few copies of the book under her pen name , after working on the fake autograph			0
' while we ca n't verify whether any particular book currently on @entity19 etc is genuine , any future books i sign in this way will be authenticated , ' she admitted			2
' my @entity1 signature is distinctive and consistent ; i spent a whole weekend practicing it to make sure , ' she said			1
miss @entity2 also revealed had offers from two tv firms to bring the crime novel to the screen even before she was ' outed '			2
she was exposed last week after publishing a detective tale , @entity1 , under the name of @entity1 earlier this year			2
she has denied claims it was a publicity stunt and said her unmasking left her angered , particularly when it emerged that her cover was blown by a senior figure at a legal firm which has represented her in the past			0
@entity2 has now pointed out the book was already gathering interest for adaptations and had sold a respectable number of copies			0
but she said it was becoming ' increasingly complicated ' to keep the charade going			0
she said : ' at the point i was ' outed ' , @entity1 had sold 8,500 @entity48 language copies across all formats ( hardback , @entity50 , library and audiobook ) and received two offers from television production companies			1
' the situation was becoming increasingly complicated , largely because @entity1 was doing rather better than we had expected him to , but we all still hoped to keep the secret a little longer			1
' yet @entity1 's success during his first three months as a published writer ( discounting sales made after i was found out ) actually compares favourably with @entity2 's success over the equivalent period of her career			1
' hit : since the revelation , sales of the book have soared and the printers of the book , @entity69 , have had to start reprinting the book in large numbers @entity2 reiterated that her exposure was not part of a clever marketing campaign to boost sales and she had gone to great lengths to continue under the guise			0
writing on a website set up for @entity1 , she said : ' if anyone had seen the labyrinthine plans i laid to conceal my identity ( or indeed my expression when i realised that the game was up ) , they would realise how little i wanted to be discovered			1
' i hoped to keep the secret as long as possible			2
i 'm grateful for all the feedback from publishers and readers , and for some great reviews			0
' being @entity1 has been all about the work , which is my favourite part of being a writer			1
@entity2 , who found fame with the @entity12 novels , said she had found the experience of writing as @entity97 ' liberating ' ' this was not a leak or marketing ploy by me , my publisher or agent , both of whom have been completely supportive of my desire to fly under the radar			0
' if sales were what mattered to me most , i would have written under my own name from the start , and with the greatest fanfare			0
' legal firm @entity111 offered an unreserved apology to the author last week after it found that one of its partners had been the source of the leak after he told his wife 's best friend in ' confidence ' about @entity1 's true identity			1
@entity2 's first @entity123 book was ' @entity124 '			0

the writer says she wanted to keep it quiet for as long as possible
the @entity129 's @entity1 became *bestseller* after she admitted she was ' @entity1 '
she said tv companies showed interest before the secret was out
