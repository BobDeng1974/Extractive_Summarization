it was the pit bull versus the pineapple but it appears the tropical fruit is too much of a prickly customer for this pooch			1
quite what petrified @entity6 the dog is unknown , but owner @entity8 who posted the footage on @entity12 said her pet , which is a cross breed mix , gets ' spooked by strange things			1
' ' i think she 's just a bit skittish , ' said @entity18 , from @entity19 , @entity20 , adding her dog is ' timid around random objects , like balloons			2
' peeved pit bull @entity6 eyes her enemy as the spiky tropical fruit sits on the counter			1
her owner @entity30 said she found the dog wandering the streets near her home in @entity19 , @entity20 and that she is n't familiar with day to day stuff in the hope of showing the cowardly canine that the fruit was harmless @entity8 placed the pineapple on the floor , but @entity6 continued to bark at it			1
her other dog eventually showed @entity6 that the fruit was harmless the 62 second clip shows @entity6 barking at the fruit which is placed on the sideboard above her			1
as @entity8 tries to show her that it is nothing to be scared of by placing it on the floor , the petrified pit bull backs off			1
' @entity6 trusts me and i trust her , ' wrote @entity18			2
' i turned the camera off when it was clear that she was not going to approach the pineapple on her own			0
' then i called my other dog over and showed her that it was okay , ' she added			0
' i was n't thrusting the pineapple at her or chasing after her with it			0
i am not that horrible or awful			0
' i really do n't want to train my dog to attack everything that she is scared of			0
i mean , if she viciously mauled the pineapple , then i would n't get a tasty fruit snack			0
and that would be sad			0
' after @entity6 became a @entity12 hit , @entity8 showed the footage to her bemused dog , who appeared less than impressed with the outcome she added that @entity6 and the fruit had ' made friends			1
' after the video went viral on the internet , @entity8 showed it to @entity6 and tweeted a picture of the result			2
needless to say , her pooch was less than impressed			0
' there will be murderings , ' @entity8 joked about her bemused pooch .			2

@entity6 the pit bull mix barked madly at the spiky tropical fruit
her owner @entity8 said the dog gets spooked by strange things
she found @entity6 wandering the streets around a *month* *ago*
@entity91 and fruit have since made friends
