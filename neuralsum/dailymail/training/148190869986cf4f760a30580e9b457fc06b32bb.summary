by @entity0 published : 11:48 est , 15 january 2014 an army medic who developed a potentially fatal illness after being exposed to uranium in @entity5 has just weeks left to raise the £ 100,000 she needs to pay for life - saving treatment			1
@entity7 , 31 , was exposed to depleted uranium while treating injured comrades at a field hospital in 2003			1
after years of failing health she was diagnosed with a debilitating immune disorder which is so rare that neither the @entity13 nor the @entity16 offer life - saving treat sufferers			1
doctors in @entity18 told the army wife she could have pioneering treatment in @entity21 to reboot her immune system , but the life - saving procedure would cost a whopping £ 100,000			1
@entity7 developed an autoimmune disease after being exposed to uranium in @entity5 in 2003			1
life - saving treatment is not available in the @entity27 so she is having to raise £ 100,000 to pay for treatment in the @entity18 mrs @entity7 has been forced to book the stem cell procedure for next month despite still needing to raise the final £ 25,000 because doctors have told her time is running out			1
mrs @entity7 , from @entity32 , @entity33 , said : ‘ it is not as if i ’m asking for something like a swim with the dolphins to make me happy			2
‘ i am going to die without this treatment			0
‘ i ’ve got to the point where i am about £ 25,000 short of the target but have gone for it			1
‘ it ’s sort of now or never anyway , because i ’ve been told it will be too late for treatment if it ’s left any longer			2
‘ i ’ve booked the treatment , although i have not paid for it			0
’ she added : ‘ it involves taking my stem cells and giving them a massive blast of chemotherapy , and then replacing them and sort of tricking the immune system into thinking there is nothing wrong , like a reboot of the whole thing			0
she has already raised £ 75,000 but is running out of time to raise the remaining £ 25,000 because her health is deteriorating ‘ it can potentially kill me - i ’ll be left with literally no immune system			1
i know that , but i do n’t have much choice			0
‘ but i ’ve seen the other people who ’ve had what i have and they ’ve had the treatment , and they are a real inspiration			0
it ’s a recognised treatment over there , which the medical insurers in @entity18 are prepared to pay for			1
’ mrs @entity7 thinks she was exposed to the highly poisonous material - used to increase the penetrative power of bombs and bullets - when she was sent to a derelict airstrip called @entity75 , seven miles from @entity76			1
it contained dumped tanks blown up by uranium - enhanced weapons in the 1991 war			2
before flying home she was handed a white plastic card by @entity85 officials saying she could have been exposed to dust containing depleted uranium during her deployment and should inform her gp			2
but the young medic feared it would be put on her medical records and could possibly stop her getting life insurance or a mortgage			0
four years later , she visited her doctors because she was feeling constantly cold and numb , with aches and pains all over her body			0
she was diagnosed with systemic sclerosis - the rare autoimmune disorder causes abnormal growth of the connective tissue			2
this causes vascular damage and hardening of the internal organs , preventing them working properly			0
symptoms include dry skin , swelling of the fingers and toes , tiredness , weight loss , muscle pain , joint pain , heartburn , bloating , coughing , dizziness and breathlessness			0
mrs @entity7 said : ' since i was diagnosed , everything 's been a battle - as well as battling the illness i 've been fighting to try and access the right treatment			2
' now we 've been offered this ray of light but obviously we need help to raise the money			0
' i 've lost about 90 per cent of my mobility and the longer i live with the illness , the more i 'm deteriorating physically , but i know i ca n't give up			0
' mrs @entity7 travelled to @entity132 in @entity21 - the world ’s leading treatment centre which is filled with @entity85 veterans - in october 2012			2
mrs @entity7 needs treatment which would see her stem cells blasted with chemotherapy to reboot her immune system by tricking her body into thinking she is well			2
without it she will not survive doctors told her the condition would eventually kill - probably in around a year - unless she has the £ 100,000 treatment which would see her stem cells blasted with chemotherapy to reboot her immune system by tricking her body into thinking she is well			1
her family , friends and husband , @entity148 , have raised around £ 75,000 - but desperately need the final cash before time runs out			1
she said : ‘ it took a year before that to raise the £ 20,000 to get me to @entity21 and have the tests in the first place , so i did n’t think it was possible to raise £ 100,000			1
‘ when i came back from @entity18 i was thinking it was such a short space of time to raise a huge amount of money and i did n’t know how we were going to do it			1
‘ i was n’t expecting this kind of response at all , it ’s overwhelming and amazing			0
’ she is planning to open a pop - up shop to sell some her belongings to trying and reach her final goal			0
‘ i am literally going to sell everything i own , ’ she said			0
to donate cash , visit : @entity169			0

@entity7 , 31 , developed a rare and potentially fatal autoimmune disease after being exposed to uranium near @entity76 in 2003
life - saving treatment is not available in the @entity27 - she can have it in the @entity18 but it costs £ 100,000 and she will have to pay for it herself
she has raised £ 75,000 already but her health is deteriorating so she is running out of time to raise the final £ 25,000
she has had to book it before it is too late - but it wo n't be able to go ahead unless she raises the remaining money in just a few weeks
an earlier *version* of this *article* said that @entity188 had ' *snubbed* ' @entity7 . the *charity* has asked us to point out that they are providing all flights and *accommodation* in relation to her treatment and we are happy to *clarify* this .
