on the day of the attack i.			0
. walked in surprised to see him knowing that he had been put in hospital			2
' there had been no communication to say that he had been released from hospital			2
had i known that he had made threats against my life i would have been able to assess the situation and distance myself from the whole thing for my own safety			0
' finding out he had said that he wanted to kill me on the spot was a shock			0
i was annoyed that this had n't been communicated to me when he had said it to two different people			0
' i was aware he disliked me but not that he wanted to kill me			0
' @entity1 described the day of the attack as very surreal and still , to this day , suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder because of it as well as other disabilities which affect her mobility			1

she said : ' i had simply gone in for what i thought was a normal meeting and was shocked to see him there but figured he must have just been discharged from hospital			2
' when i went into the meeting room with another member of staff i did n't actually realise he had stabbed me until my leg have way and i saw blood on the floor			2
' my colleague had n't even noticed and says that it all happened so fast she did n't register what was going on			0

miss @entity1 still has to deal with the effects of the attack on a daily basis			2
she is unable to walk very far and has recently got herself a mobility scooter to help she now has scars covering her torso , back and forearm from that day and is thankful to even be alive she said : ' you ’re treated like cannon fodder - you ’re facing verbal assaults and physical threats and there ’s no back - up from the local authority			2
' social workers are getting back to their own kids at 7pm or 8pm completely exhausted and there ’s no support for them			0
' the usual result is social workers end up going off on sick leave , and then moving jobs			0
this means that good workers are not retained by the authority			0
