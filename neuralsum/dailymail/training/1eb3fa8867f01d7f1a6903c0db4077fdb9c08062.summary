there was a serious case of bad dresses on good bodies at the @entity4 last night			1
from @entity7 in what could only have been inspired by wallpaper , to @entity11 's sequined style sin , the stylists in charge should surely be sacked			1
@entity12 , who has one of the most sensational figures in @entity15 , failed to impress on the red carpet in a cutaway printed gown			1
the split in the dated pink printed skirt did at least allow the star to do her best impression of ' @entity36 's leg ' , and the nude court shoes were , at least , an elegant , understated choice			1
@entity7 's @entity40 gown also stood out for all the wrong reasons			1
while the smiling star no doubt felt like a princess in the full - skirted @entity40 gown - and we applaud her risk - taking - the print seemed to be more appropriate for wallpaper or a tablecloth than an evening gown			1
@entity51 - usually a regular on the best - dressed list - fell short for us this evening too			2
the wallpaper look : @entity7 's @entity40 gown stood out for all the wrong reasons arm candy : the only saving grace of @entity55 's confusing look was that she arrived on the arm of @entity57 ( left )			1
@entity60 's @entity59 gown had too - deep splits at the chest and thigh ( right ) she said she wanted to support @entity65 fashion , so selected a gown by @entity67			2
and while the look is sure to impress fashion insiders , it did n't do many favors for her figure			2
the top part sat awkwardly on her bust , and was positioned slightly off - center above the column skirt			2
on the plus side , the simple hair and make - up was a wise choice with a busy print - the soft pink lip , in particular , looked fresh and pretty			2
unfortunately little could save @entity11 's look			2
the silver sequin gown was just that little bit too tight and clung in all the wrong places			2
missing the mark : @entity87 looked ready for work in her bizarre shirt - dress ( left ) while @entity90 was channeling 1991 in her dated gown ( right ) perhaps it would have worked if the neckline were not as high and the cut not quite as austere , but on this occasion there was nothing to save it			1
perhaps @entity11 's serious expression indicates that she knows this all too well			2
it was an issue shared by @entity101 , though , whose powder - blue peplum added unnecessary bulk to her otherwise slim frame			0
@entity87 - who has successfully elevated her profile from @entity107 to serious actress with roles in @entity110 and @entity111 - made an unlikely choice in a shirt - style dress			1
the full skirt could not save it from looking too office - like to be a real success though , and for such a flamboyant personality , the expectations for a fun choice were higher			0
unflattering : @entity101 ( left ) and @entity11 ( right ) wore dresses that failed to do their slim figures favors			0
@entity51 's gown is sure to please fashionistas , but looks awkward to the average eye ( center ) at the other end of the scale , though , was actress @entity90 , whose corseted gown with layers of brown chiffon and black lace looked like a design from circa 1991 - and not in a good way			0
@entity135 was another starlet who missed the mark on the red carpet in a floor length gown that looked slightly as if it had been made out of pale blue curtains			1
an over fussy pattern , combined with a high neck and long sleeve swamped the petite stars tiny frame			0
over-the - top : @entity135 's intricately patterned dress and thick blue eyeshadow did the petite star no favours the reality - star - turned - designer also was sporting some less than flattering make - up ; seemingly having gone a little overboard with the fake tan			1
the slightly orange hue and heavy blue eye makeup served to make the 31 - year - old look far older than her years			0
@entity157 was another star who seriously misjudged her makeup			0
perhaps taking her role as the virginal prude in @entity161 a little too far , she ruined a stunning fitted black gown by completely abstaining from any makeup or accessories			0
with her hair pull back too tightly and looking a little greasy she looked decidedly drab and dull next to her glamorous red carpet companions			0
both @entity167 ( right ) and @entity157 ( left ) wore elegant classic cut dresses , but both managed to spoil their look ; @entity167 with her creature - like bag , and @entity172 with a decided lack of make - up and jewelry @entity167 similarly managed to detract from a stunning dress with some poor accessory choices			1
while her bold salmon coloured dress wowed crowds and set of her skin tone perfectly , the look was let down by her furry clutch bag			1
closely resembling a muppet , the furry monstrosity looked like it may jump to life at any minute , and rather detracted from the otherwise polished look			0
@entity189 ’s @entity188 suffered a serious bad hair day			0
while her dress was a bit of a frock horror it was her dodgy 80s hair that needed work			1
her ‘ do ’ suggested she was dragged through a bush on the way over to the awards or simply misplaced her hair brush			0
a safer bet would have been some sleek finger waves or a more polished do like @entity203 or @entity204			0
from top to toe : @entity207 ( right ) seems to have forgotten the end of her dress , while @entity188 's ( left ) hair looks like she had an altercation with a rather angry rose bush on her way to the awards @entity207 is usually a staple of ‘ best dressed ’ lists , but last night she seemed to have left the bottom of her dress at home			1
her sheer nude dress ticked all the right boxes from the knees upwards , but there was some seriously unflattering ankle flapping happening from the usually stylish beauty			1
that being said , there were n't too many fashion faux pas at the @entity4 this year			0
perhaps years of attacks from fashion police has taught the a-list that it is wiser to play it safe in flattering black and ethereal beiges and nudes			0
thank goodness there are still a few who are brave enough to give us something to talk about .			0

@entity7 appeared to be wearing a dress made out of wallpaper , and there were some serious style sins committed with sequins
