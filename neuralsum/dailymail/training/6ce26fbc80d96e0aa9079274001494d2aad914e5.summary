by @entity0 follow @ @ ralphellis56 @entity0 runs you through what we learned from the weekend 's football			2
this week , @entity5 seems to be feeling the pressure of being @entity8 's focal point as they try to get over the line , why @entity10 will miss @entity11 in their quest for @entity14 glory and @entity15 might be sweating on his @entity17 place ... 1			1
is the pressure of trying to take @entity8 across the line to a @entity21 title starting to affect @entity5 ? the @entity22 has been on pretty much perfect behaviour all season with only four yellow cards all season before sunday , compared with 11 last year as well as his controversial clash with @entity29			1
on sunday he took less than five minutes to get booked for a bad foul , and was fortunate not to get a second yellow for taking a tumble in search of a second half penalty			1
proceed with caution : @entity5 is shown the yellow card by @entity38 on sunday taking a tumble : @entity5 goes down a little easily under the challenge of @entity41 frustration : @entity5 has a moan as @entity43 stands over him 2			1
if there is one player @entity10 will miss in their bid to land another @entity14 it is midfielder @entity11			1
the @entity48 , cup tied in @entity50 but a key part of the @entity21 side since he returned to the club from @entity54 for £ 21million in january , created @entity56 ’s winner at @entity57			0
it was the fourth goal he ’s made , but it is his defensive midfield work that has been key for @entity60			0
in 13 games he ’s now made 43 tackles , 48 clearances and 28 interceptions			0
the shield : @entity10 will miss @entity11 ( right ) in the @entity14 , especially his defensive work 3			1
@entity15 was being hailed as @entity69 football ’s big new hope after he helped clinch @entity17 qualification on his debut back in october but is now sweating on whether he ’s even in the squad			1
recovered now from the hamstring injury which kept him out of the opening matches in @entity76 ’s time as @entity78 boss , he has n’t been able to force his way back in the team			0
while fellow winger @entity81 played a part in all three of @entity78 ’s goals , @entity15 was a sub for just the final five minutes at @entity85 , and has only once played 90 minutes in the last 14 games when he has been fit			1
peripheral figure : @entity15 ( right ) , played just five minutes as substitute for @entity78 on saturday 4			1
@entity89 started work at @entity91 after the transfer deadline , so the only player he was able to sign was @entity94 , who was out of work and trying to prove he ’d beaten a persistent knee injury			1
the former @entity98 midfielder , released from @entity99 last summer because of his fitness issues , has proved an inspired choice			0
saturday ’s win over @entity103 made it two wins in two appearances for the 32 - year - old whose work has given far more protection to @entity91 ’s fragile defence			1
inspired : @entity94 ( right ) has returned to @entity91 and the club have won both times he 's played 5			1
as if @entity114 did n’t have enough problems after five defeats in a row , they will have to do without defender @entity118 for two of their last six games			1
the 28 - year - old , branded ' the most unprofessional player i have ever worked with ' by previous boss @entity125 , only had to negotiate one more game without a booking to reach the deadline to escape a ban under the @entity130 ’s totting up process			2
instead he picked up his 10th yellow card in 33 matches for a clumsy foul on @entity135 early in the second half of the 1 - 0 defeat by @entity138			0
banned : @entity118 ( right ) is suspended for two matches after picking up his 10th booking of the season 6			2
@entity143 goalkeeper @entity142 did his chances of finding a new club no harm with his penalty shoot - out heroics in the @entity150 semi-final win over @entity151			1
the 28 - year - old , a free agent this summer after turning down a new deal at the @entity154 because he wants regular first - team football , has not played a single @entity21 game this season			0
but in his cup appearances – which also included a penalties win at @entity85 in the @entity162 – he ’s let in just seven goals in nine matches			0
saving his career ? @entity142 's @entity150 penalty heroics might just help him find a new club 7			1
@entity169 has been a target for angry @entity172 fans after a miserable season since his free transfer move from @entity175 – a midweek fanzine pointed out his record in 15 matches was no goals , no assists and just 10 shots			0
the @entity183 striker is still searching for his first goal but he does at least now have an assist to his name			0
after coming on as sub it was his clever flick that opened up @entity190 ’s back line to enable @entity191 to score the second of his goals in a 2 - 0 win			2
assist : @entity169 ( back ) celebrates with @entity191 after setting him up for @entity172 ' second goal 8			0
with former @entity78 and @entity175 midfielder @entity201 as his dad , and @entity203 and @entity175 stiker @entity204 now his step - dad , @entity199 ’s youngster @entity198 should n’t struggle for career guidance			2
it ’s not clear which of them – or whether it was both – advised him to turn down both @entity143 and @entity211 as a youngster in the hope of getting more games if he signed for @entity199			0
either way it looks a good decision			0
the @entity220 youth midfielder , who will be 20 later this month , has now played 31 games this season and got his third goal in the 3 - 0 win over @entity224 that lifted the @entity225 into the @entity227 play - off zone			1
@entity228 move : @entity198 turned down @entity143 and @entity211 and is reaping the benefit at @entity199 9			0
@entity231 earned the @entity233 plaudits for his saves that helped @entity235 to a much needed win at @entity237 , but there ’s another @entity239 goalkeeper building a reputation behind him			2
@entity241 , 23 , who moved to @entity242 from @entity243 last summer , has helped @entity245 work miracles at @entity246 since going there on loan			0
when @entity241 arrived at @entity249 at the end of january , @entity246 were second from bottom and three points adrift of safety			0
they have lost only two of seven games @entity241 has played since – and saturday ’s 1 - 0 win at @entity257 lifted them to 13th place and the chance of a top half finish			2
safe hands : @entity241 has been in excellent form on loan at @entity246 from @entity239 10			0
@entity264 went down from @entity265 with 51 points last season , and it is beginning to look as if it will need another record haul to achieve survival this @entity270 46 points which @entity272 have after a 1 - 0 win over @entity274 would have been enough to ensure survival in all but two of the 10 previous @entity278 the result did this time , however , was to set up friday ’s trip to @entity280 , above the 23rd - placed @entity281 on goal difference only , as a huge @entity284 encounter .			2

@entity5 fortunate not to be sent off in @entity8 's win on sunday
@entity10 will miss @entity11 in the @entity14
@entity15 may struggle to make @entity220 's @entity17 squad
@entity94 has been an inspiration since returning to @entity91
@entity118 's ban is more bad news for *sinking* @entity114
@entity142 's spot - kick saves could help him find a new club
