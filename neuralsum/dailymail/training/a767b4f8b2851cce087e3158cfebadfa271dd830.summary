@entity0 has called for access to the @entity2 to be limited to @entity4 citizens , despite more than one in 10 health staff coming from overseas			1
the @entity8 leader claimed ' the @entity9 is here for @entity4 citizens ' as he boasted £ 3billion could be spent on healthcare if @entity4 left the @entity11			1
he also argued the 5million foreign citizens living in the @entity4 should be banned from taking part in any referendum on severing ties with @entity16			2
@entity8 leader @entity0 claimed ' the @entity9 is here for @entity4 citizens ' , raising the prospect of people like his @entity20 wife @entity19 being excluded it raises the prospect of his @entity20 wife @entity19 being denied the vote and barred from using the @entity2			1
mr @entity0 , who has advocated an insurance - funded model for the @entity2 in the past , was again forced to insist @entity8 is now committed to a health service that was free at the point of delivery			1
but he said the service was struggling because of the ' massive increase ' in the country 's population			0
he called for measures to crack down on health tourism and said people studying for medical subjects should be exempt from tuition fees to reduce the @entity2 's reliance on migrant workers			1
mr @entity0 sparked a storm of controversy last october when he suggested migrants with @entity42 should not be allowed to enter @entity4			1
he said he wanted to control the ‘ quality ’ of immigration into @entity4 and suggested this should include the medical condition of incomers			0
but he went much further , and suggested only @entity4 citizens should be allowed to use the @entity2 , despite foreign nationals paying tax in the @entity4 and thousands working in the health service themselves			1
figures from the @entity54 ( @entity54 ) , show that 12 per cent of people working in the @entity2 and community health services are not @entity4			1
among qualified clinical staff the figure is 14 per cent , and for doctors it is 26 per cent			2
the @entity61 has warned that ) to observe that without @entity64 staff , ' many @entity2 services would struggle to provide effective care to their patients '			1
but mr @entity0 suggested they should be banned from using the health service themselves			2
he told @entity72 's @entity71 show : ' i very much take the view that it is a @entity9 , and to open ourselves up - whether it 's to @entity42 treatment , whether it 's to maternity services or whatever it is - to the rest of the world , does n't make sense			1
' it is costing us at least £ 2 billion a year , the @entity9 is here for @entity4 citizens			1
he added : ' we want the @entity2 to be better run , we want it to be more efficient			0
we think it 's ludicrous that middle management has grown by 48 per cent , we think the fact that health tourism is costing £ 2billion a year is wrong and the fact that one in five new nurses being taken on have to come from abroad says to us ' let 's make sure there are no tuition fees for people who are taking medical degrees '			0
' we want a @entity9 that is free at the point of delivery and funded through taxation			0
' but the one thing nobody dares say is the reason we have an @entity2 crisis right now is because of a massive increase in the population in this country			0
' figures from the @entity54 ( @entity54 ) , show that 12 per cent of people working in the @entity2 and community health services are not @entity4 he announced @entity8 would promise an extra £ 3 billion a year for the @entity2 ' funded out of the fact that we will not be paying daily membership fees as members of the @entity11 '			1
however , the @entity116 promise of an in - out referendum before the end of 2017 means it could be several years before @entity4 could leave the @entity11			1
@entity8 has also been damaged by comments made by party secretary @entity120 that the @entity2 is a ' waste of money '			1
@entity123 emerged from 2010 of mr @entity120 attacking the health service at events in the @entity126			2
speaking at the @entity128 conference in @entity129 he said : ' when i was younger a trillion was an astronomic number			0
now when i look at our national deficits , and your national deficits , actually it is an economic number			0
' a number i could n't possible imagine when i was younger is now the amount of money that is owed by my country , and soon more than that by your country , to other countries , paying for wasteful socialist programmes			0
and of course at the heart of this , the @entity146 bunker of socialism is the @entity9			0
' mr @entity0 , pictured , has faced a string of dire headlines , including the defection of an mep to the @entity154 and the party secretary branding the @entity2 a ' waste of money ' @entity158 has promised to renegotiate @entity4 ’s membership , clawing powers back from @entity16 and clamping down on welfare abuse , before staging an in - out vote by 2017			1
@entity8 leader @entity0 said he would be willing to back a @entity116 government after the election , but wanted the referendum , held soon with only @entity166 ’s allowed to take part			2
he said : ‘ i would say i want a referendum , i want it now			0
i want a referendum with good rules – namely the spending limits for both sides are the same			0
' and i want a guarantee that in this referendum the only people that can vote are @entity4 citizens because at the moment you know there are 4 million or so @entity11 citizens living in @entity4 who i do not think should be allowed to vote in that referendum			1
’ at the @entity184 in the same year he said : ' this socialist government wastes money like you ca n't imagine			0
they have started doing every wasteful scheme under the sun ... the biggest waste of money of course in the @entity4 is the @entity2 , the @entity9			1
' mr @entity0 said mr @entity120 ' made those comments as a @entity184 and he was very critical of hundreds of millions of pounds being wasted through middle management '			2
he went on to complain about @entity8 policies come under attack from rivals			0
' once again we have a general election campaign being fought on @entity126 terms where it 's all negativity			0
' it 's artillery shells being lobbed between @entity206 and conservatives and now of course towards @entity8			0
' @entity206 frontbencher @entity209 said : ' either @entity0 supports this or mr @entity120 can not stay in post			2
@entity0 can not simultaneously defend these comments and claim that his party stands for the @entity2 free at the point of use			2
' the man chosen by @entity0 to control @entity8 's image has compared the @entity2 to @entity220 's @entity219 bunker			1
this is @entity8 's real agenda on the @entity2			2
' today @entity206 is shining a light on @entity0 and his party 's true views on the future of the @entity2			2
they claim to defend the service we cherish , but they want to dismantle its foundations			0
' @entity8 can no longer attempt to fool people			0
they are a party of @entity116 people , @entity116 money and they want to extend the worst @entity116 policies , which would have horrific effects on working people			0

@entity0 declares : ' @entity9 is here for @entity4 citizens '
treatments like @entity42 care and maternity services should not be ' opened up '
latest figures show 12 ***%*** of all health workers are not @entity4 citizens
26 ***%*** of doctors and 14 ***%*** of *midwives* come from overseas , data shows
@entity0 says £ 3billion spent on @entity11 membership could be used on @entity2
comes after video showed @entity8 secretary calling @entity2 a ' waste of money '
@entity120 also compared @entity2 to @entity219 in 2010 speech
