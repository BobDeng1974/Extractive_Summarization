new dad @entity0 starts saturday 's eagerly anticipated clash with the @entity2 ready to be more responsible off the field but more reckless on it			1
whatever happens on the pitch at @entity9 , the 27 - year - old @entity7 lock has already had the most momentous week of his life after fiancee @entity11 gave birth to the couple ’s first child , @entity13 , on tuesday night , just hours after he was named in the starting line - up to face the world champions			1
if baby @entity13 had delayed her arrival until later this week there was every chance @entity0 , who has won all but two of his 12 caps from the bench , would have missed his chance to stake a @entity26 claim ; four years after a nine - week stamping ban cost him a place in @entity30 ’s squad			1
@entity32 second row @entity0 posts a photo of himself holding his newborn baby on @entity35 @entity0 trains with his @entity32 team - mates on tuesday before he was released to be with his wife ‘ emotionally i ’ve been fighting on two very big battlefields , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ one , being supportive of my fiancee and the birth of our child and doing everything i can to help them out			2
first child is once - in - a - lifetime is n’t it ? you will never get to re-do that			2
‘ and then obviously the game this weekend holds particular significance for me , even more so now that the most important person in the world is going to be expecting something from it			0
‘ my first cap was against @entity2 and i ’ve come four years on , after some trials and tribulations and a bit of time off the radar , getting back involved			2
this game is incredibly important to me			0
‘ obviously with the next 12 months shaping up as they are , then this is the time to stand up and be counted			0
i ca n’t stress how high a price i have put on this game			0
’ the @entity32 second row will line up against @entity2 on saturday after impressing for @entity7 @entity0 ’s outstanding start to the season for @entity7 , after shedding almost nine kilos over the past year , has seen the former @entity32 schoolboy discus champion add mobility to his game without losing power			1
having followed instructions from @entity32 ’s coaching team on tour in @entity76 last year , become a dad for the first time and apparently put his disciplinary issues behind him , the 6ft 7in lock is ready to inflict some pain on his opponents on saturday after @entity83 ’s withdrawal through injury			1
‘ coming back from @entity76 i decided i wanted to be the most powerful , destructive player i could be , ’ @entity0 said			2
the baby was due last friday and @entity0 had been doubtful for @entity87 at @entity9 ‘ to be more than a substitute i had to make a significant change and one of the changes was to lose weight			1
i wanted anyone that came into my area , or anyone ’s area that i went into , to come off second best			0
‘ i spent a lot of time doing heavy work in the gym , set - piece proficiency , becoming one of the best scrummaging second rows around , working the line - out , setting up mauls ; real strengths of mine			2
‘ i wanted to get moving round the field more			0
and perhaps a bit more back to when i used to carry the ball with a little less consideration , perhaps to be a little bit more exciting and more reckless			0
@entity2 ran out narrow 30 - 22 winners against @entity32 at @entity9 nearly a year ago ‘ that ’s been the focus this season			1
it has been the best start to a season ever for me			0
’ and on top of the weights , @entity0 — who , along with prop @entity121 , has been given cleaning duties at @entity32 ’s new @entity124 training facility as part of @entity127 ’s ongoing drive to instil humility in his players — hopes to find an alternative power source over the coming weeks			1
‘ i had an interesting conversation with ( fellow new dad ) @entity134 about “ dad strength ” and how every facet of your life gets a little extra gilt edge , ’ he said			0
‘ not necessarily in terms of how much you can bench press but the fact you could pull a tree out of the ground and batter someone with it			0
not the standard strength tests ! ’ @entity32 : 15 @entity149 ; 14 @entity150 , 13 @entity151 , 12 @entity152 , 11 @entity153 ; 10 @entity154 , 9 @entity134 ; 1 @entity155 , 2 @entity156 , 3 @entity157 ; 4 @entity0 , 5 @entity158 ; 6 @entity159 , 7 @entity160 ( capt ) , 8 @entity161 replacements : 16 @entity163 , 17 @entity164 , 18 @entity165 , 19 @entity166 , 20 @entity167 , 21 @entity168 , 22 @entity169 , 23 @entity170 @entity2 : 15 @entity171 ; 14 @entity172 , 13 @entity173 , 12 @entity174 , 11 @entity175 ; 10 @entity176 , 9 @entity177 ; 1 @entity178 , 2 @entity179 , 3 @entity180 ; 4 @entity181 , 5 @entity182 ; 6 @entity183 , 7 @entity184 ( capt ) , 8 @entity185 replacements : 16 @entity187 , 17 @entity188 , 18 @entity189 , 19 @entity190 , 20 @entity191 , 21 @entity192 , 22 @entity193 , 23 @entity194			1
