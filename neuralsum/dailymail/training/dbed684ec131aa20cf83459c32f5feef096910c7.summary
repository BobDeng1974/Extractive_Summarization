if you thought you had to cut out pizza when it comes to a diet , think again			0
this one claims to be better for you than a salad			0
created by a professor of human nutrition , it is billed as the world ’s healthiest pizza – and the only ready meal that is nutritionally balanced			1
the @entity13 pizza , which comes in three flavours , incorporates vitamin and mineral - rich ingredients such as ground seaweed and red pepper into its flour base and tomato sauce			1
for instance , many pizzas are high in salt and fat but lack vital vitamins and minerals			2
@entity46 , in particular , is likely to be low			0
in contrast the frozen @entity13 pizzas , which went on sale in @entity49 and @entity50 this week , have been carefully created to contain each of the 47 nutrients essential for health – and in the right amounts			1
professor @entity31 , who spoke at the @entity56 on @entity57 in @entity58 , this week , said : ‘ this is the only nutritionally - balanced ready meal anywhere			1
‘ nobody has previously designed a meal which has got everything in the right proportions			1
i ’m pretty proud of it			0
’ analysis shows the pizzas , which cost around £ 3.50 , to be healthier than shop - bought salads			2
variety : the pizzas come in three flavours and were designed as an alternative to unhealthy ready meals shop - bought salads tend to be low in protein and high in carbohydrates and fat , while a range of key vitamins and minerals are missing all together			1
professor @entity31 , of @entity79 , said : ‘ find me a salad that matches up to the eat balanced pizza			1
i have n’t been able to find one yet			0
’ to turn a pizza into a perfect meal , the professor brainstormed with @entity86 , an entrepreneur looking for new business ventures			2
mr @entity86 came up with the idea of using seaweed , collected from @entity91 beaches , to provide the vitamins and minerals missing from the average pizza			2
the seaweed , which is ground up and added to the part - wholemeal flour base , is rich in iron , zinc , vitamin b 12 and iodine			1
its gritty taste also means that only a tiny amount of salt need be added to the mix. to make a pizza with vitamin c , the pair added a tiny amount of ground red pepper to the tomato sauce			2
tomatoes are low in the vitamin but it is plentiful in red peppers			0
the cheese used is simply normal mozzarella and the calorie count is 600 – roughly a third of a person ’s daily intake			0
each pizza also contains roughly a third of the recommended daily amount of each nutrient needed for health and tests have had positive results			0
professor @entity31 said : ‘ you are not sitting on the seats of @entity129 eating it			1
it is a frozen pizza but it tastes , smells and looks as good as any other frozen pizza			0
’ at around £ 3.50 it is , however , slightly more expensive than some other 9 - inch pizzas			2
the eat balanced range has been on sale in @entity138 for several months and has just become available to @entity140 and @entity50 shoppers , through @entity141			1
those who are tempted will be glad to know that they can eat three of the pizzas a day and be perfectly nutritionally balanced			1
@entity145 , however should limit themselves to two pizzas			0
dr @entity147 , of the @entity149 @entity148 , warned that seaweed is an acquired taste			0
she added : ‘ i support the move towards improving existing foods that are very popular but i am not sure that eating two or three pizzas a day would be the best approach			0
