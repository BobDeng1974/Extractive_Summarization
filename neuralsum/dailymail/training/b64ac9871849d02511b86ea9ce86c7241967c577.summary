@entity1 scientists are calling for anorexia sufferers to join a ground - breaking study to find the genes that may cause the condition			1
researchers from @entity7 have joined forces with experts from around the world in an effort to prove that victims are born with the illness			1
@entity14 affects about 1.6 million people in @entity1 alone			2
@entity16 , who died in january , and her daughter @entity17 who was diagnosed with anorexia aged 12 in the largest example of genetic research ever done into the eating disorder , @entity19 ’s has already analysed the dna of more than 300 former anorexia sufferers			1
their target is 25,000 dna samples worldwide , including 1,000 volunteers from @entity1			2
@entity29 , the @entity30 , who last year revealed that he had suffered from anorexia , has already donated his dna			0
the global project , called @entity34 , was launched by @entity35 , a professor in the field of eating disorders at the @entity38			1
after carrying out research into anorexia in twins in 2007 , she discovered that the illness can be inherited , and that more than half the risk of developing the disorder is due to genetic factors			1
she said : ‘ we know very little about the biology of anorexia and hopefully by identifying these genes we will be able to develop new treatments			2
it is not just one gene – it will be hundreds of genes			0
’ ground - breaking : in the largest example of genetic research ever done into the eating disorder , @entity19 's has already analysed the dna of more than 300 former anorexia sufferers the @entity1 research is backed by the charity @entity62 ’s @entity61 , set up in memory of @entity16 , a farmer ’s wife who died aged 48 in january			1
her daughter @entity17 was diagnosed with anorexia aged 12			0
@entity62 rapidly became aware of the stigma associated with the illness and was frustrated by the lack of scientific research being done			1
she was convinced that her daughter ’s eating disorder was in her dna and that @entity17 had not chosen to be anorexic			0
after being diagnosed with terminal cancer , @entity62 wrote a book on anorexia designed to help parents			0
she also founded the charity to collect the dna of anorexia sufferers and fund research into the illness			1
in her book , throwing @entity85 , @entity62 wrote : ‘ i want people to stop being afraid and ashamed of something that is not their fault			0
i want to educate the 99 per cent of the world that do n’t know or do n’t care that the eating disorder world deserves a voice			2
‘ i want people to know that my daughter is not a vain , mindless bimbo who just wants to be thin , but a stellar , brilliant , important part of the community who just happens to have a brain blip			0
’ @entity101 , a senior lecturer at @entity19 , is leading the @entity34 project			0
he said : ‘ what we want to discover is are genetics and biology behind the illness , because if we can find the biology behind the illness , we can design specific treatments			1
we want to help sufferers survive			2
’ @entity112 , a friend of @entity62 and chairman of the charity , said : ‘ we knew we were going to keep this going for her			0
we wanted to find a way to carry research forward , to bring this research to the @entity1 and put @entity62 ’s name on it			1
’ she added : ‘ there are still a lot of myths and tales and this is something that can give us some reality , some science			0
people will then understand that an eating disorder is not an illness of choice			0
’ the research has been backed by @entity1 ’s leading centre for eating disorders , the @entity135 at the @entity136 , which is part of @entity138 and @entity139			2
@entity140 , the unit ’s director , said : ‘ the research looking at interactions between genes and the environment is invaluable because it does take away a bit of the guilt and confusion from families who are dealing with eating disorders			1
’ @entity62 ’s @entity61 has no government funding and relies on donations to pay for @entity75 samples to be taken .			0

@entity7 researchers have joined experts from around the world
if they find the biology behind the *disease* they can better treat sufferers
the research has been called ' invaluable ' as it will take away the stigma
