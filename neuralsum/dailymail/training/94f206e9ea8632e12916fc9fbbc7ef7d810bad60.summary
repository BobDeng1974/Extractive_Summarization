by @entity0 published : 14:20 est , 25 january 2014 updated : 19:38 est , 25 january 2014 a scientist has been given a € 1million grant by the government to build the country 's first plant for converting sewage in to energy			1
dr @entity9 has developed a process called @entity11 ( @entity12 ) which converts sewage , agricultural waste , food waste and slurry into carbon and water			1
the end product , dubbed biocoal , does not contain sulphur			0
it therefore burns more cleanly and qualifies for renewable energy subsidies			0
now the doctor 's company @entity23 has been awarded a grant of € 1million by the @entity26 to build the country 's first biowaste conversion plant			1
a doctor has invented a way to convert sewage into coal - which can be used in existing power plants a statement on the company 's wesbite said : ' over the past 5 years @entity23 has developed a process that turns biowaste into a high value biofuel – biocoal			1
@entity23 ’s technology is unique with its ability to convert 100 per cent of organic matter into a high heat value biofuel – biocoal			0
' in so doing , solves two major issues a ) diverting waste from landfill and b ) providing a carbon neutral fuel			2
the grant will enable @entity23 to progress to the next stage of building and commissioning its first prototype plant which will be producing approximately 500 tonnes of biocoal by march 2014			2
' dr @entity9 added : ' it ’s mad that we pay people to take away our waste , when it ’s actually a valuable commodity			1
it ’s like flushing coal down the toilet , or paying the bin men to take away our money			0
' @entity12 involves cooking biomass at @entity65 and at an atmospheric pressure of 20bar			1
it is essentially the same process that creates coal - except it takes hours rather than thousands of years			2
a sample of the biocoal			0
it is created by cooking biowaste under pressure @entity77 slurry can be dried into pellets and used as a direct replacement for fossil coal in existing power generating facilities , as well as in @entity82 ( @entity82 ) and household boilers			1
use of the @entity12 method could cut the operating costs of any sewage plant by half , slash its energy use by 73 per cent and reduce carbon emissions by 95 per cent , according to a study by the @entity92			2
by using the @entity12 process related emissions could cut be reduced to a twentieth of their current level , says the study			0
according to a recent lifecycle assessment by @entity99 in conjunction with @entity101 , @entity12 is four times more efficient at dealing with sludge than anaerobic digestion			0
today ’s stringent @entity106 and national directives mean that sewage sludge can not be spread on farmland and is an expensive overhead			0
dr @entity9 displayed a sample product of biocoal made from orange peel discarded from a fruit processing plan at the @entity116 event in @entity117 on friday , ' they say it ’ll cost € 750m to refurbish one of @entity106 ’s power stations			1
@entity12 creates a fuel that can be used in existing power plants , so it would save millions in energy infrastructure costs			0

dr @entity9 invented the @entity11 process
turns biomass into carbon and water by heating it under pressure
