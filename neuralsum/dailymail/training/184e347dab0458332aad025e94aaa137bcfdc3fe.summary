astronomers have so far been attempting to find alien life by sniffing out their chemical signature			0
but researchers say they have found a better way of finding extra-terrestrial beings : through vibrations			2
the @entity8 team has now created the first tiny motion detector that it claims may someday help find microscopic life forms on distant planets			1
the device can hold around 500 bacteria taking advantage of movement , which they call ' a universal signature of life , ' the sensor aims to identify on a nano - level the tiny motions that all life forms make			1
they team began to explore the possibility of searching for life with a sensor attuned to those tiny vibrations in organisms such as bacteria and yeast			1
' the nanomotion detector allows studying life from a new perspective : life is movement , ' said professor @entity42 at the @entity43			0
' this means that the nanomotion detector can detect any small movement of living systems and deliver a complementary point of view in the search for life			2
' good vibrations : the sensor has already shown it can detect living things , including @entity55 ( artists 's impression pictured ) and yeast , as well as human , plant and mice cells in the lab professor @entity42 worked with colleagues at @entity65 in @entity66 to create the an instrument that is smaller than a millimetre - just a few hundred microns in length			1
one micron is equal to 1000 nanometres or the thickness of a red blood cell			1
most bacteria are from 1 to 10 micrometers long and the device can hold around 500 bacteria			1
the sensor uses a nano - sized cantilever to detect motion			1
a cantilever is essentially a beam that is anchored only at one end , with the other end bearing a load			2
it is most often used with bridges and buildings , but in the sensor it is used on the micrometre scale , and it can hold around 500 bacteria			1
the idea comes from the technology behind an existing microscope , the atomic force microscope , which uses a cantilever to produce pictures of the very atoms on a surface			2
the cantilever scans the surface like the needle of a record player and its up - and - down movement is read by a laser to produce an image			2
the motion sensor works the same way , but here the sample is attached on the cantilever itself			1
for example , a bacterium attaches to the cantilever			0
if the bacterium is alive , it will inevitably move in some way			0
that motion also moves the much smaller and sensitive cantilever and it is captured by the readout laser as series of vibrations			2
the signal is taken as a sign of life			0
the team tested the sensor on a variety of living things , including @entity55 , yeast , as well as human , plant and mice cells in the lab. in all cases , when living organisms were placed near the sensor , they ' produced an increase in the amplitude of the measured fluctuations , ' said the study			1
professor @entity42 also scooped up soil and water from the grounds near his @entity144 lab and found that the sensor could detect tiny life there , too			1
researchers found they could manipulate the movements of the life forms by adding nutrients which the cells would consume , or adding chemicals that would kill them , making the motion stop			1
' the detection system can be used as a simple , extremely sensitive , and weight - efficient ' life detector , '' the study said			0
a prototype would cost less than £ 6,400 ( $ 10,000 ) , would use very little battery power and could be contained in a 20 by 20 cm box			0
the device has not been presented yet to @entity162 or @entity163 , but efforts are under way to write a proposal and make a prototype that could travel to space on a robotic vessel			0
if it had been available to the @entity163 's @entity173 mission , which recently sent its @entity175 lander onto a comet for the first time and detected , it could have propelled the science one step further , the researchers claims			0
if the world 's space agencies find a way to use it , the detector could be used to search for life on the moons of @entity186 or @entity187 , or on @entity188 , where it might help scientists recognise life exists in a form that they had not previously expected or understood			0
sense of scale : the sensor is just a few hundred microns in length			1
one micron is equal to 1000 nanometres or the thickness of a red blood cell or a glucose molecule the sensor could also be used to detect extreme life forms in areas that are hard to measure on @entity205 , such as volcanoes and the ocean floor , he said			1
however , it could be years before the sensor is actually tested in space			0
' it is rare that anything is " simple " in the context of space exploration , ' said @entity215 , a professor in the @entity216 and @entity217 and the department of chemistry and biochemistry at @entity221			0
nonetheless , professor @entity215 , who was not involved in the study , described the work as ' refreshing ' and a ' fundamentally new idea			0
' ' motion - detection on such a scale has never been attempted before as an extraterrestrial life detection approach , ' he said			2
' if it is as technologically simple to implement as the authors claim , then it could be worth integrating into future mission concepts			0
' if the world 's space agencies find a way to use it , the detector could be used to search for life on the moons of @entity186 or @entity187 , or on @entity188 ( pictured ) , where it might help scientists recognise life exists in a form that they had not previously expected or understood			0

tiny sensor was created by researchers in @entity144 and @entity66
it uses a nano - sized cantilever to detect motion in living organisms
it has already proven *successful* in detecting human , plant and mice cells
device is just a few microns in length and can hold around 500 bacteria
a micron is equal to 1000 nanometres or the thickness of a red blood cell
