an eventful first day at the @entity1 saw @entity2 come close to achieving something that had n’t been witnessed at @entity4 for 20 years while @entity5 cheered up his sick three year old son @entity6 with a fine opening round of 67			1
@entity5 ’s preparations for his final tournament before the @entity10 were hardly ideal			1
while driving home from the course on wednesday , @entity6 was being taken to a nearby hospital with what turned out to be a bout of pneumonia			1
it was past midnight before he was allowed home			0
‘ it was certainly something of a blessing that i had a late tee - time , ’ said the @entity18 , who posted five birdies in a round that left him just a stroke off the pace set by @entity23			0
@entity2 waits on the first green during the first round of the @entity1 at @entity28 @entity5 hits his tee shot on the 18th hole during the first round of the @entity1 @entity5 ’s in good form at present , and having thrown away a golden opportunity to win one event in @entity35 at the @entity36 three weeks ago , will be keen to give himself a chance to atone at this venue where he finished third in 2013			1
‘ it was nice to get @entity6 home on wednesday night and my wife @entity41 is a trained nurse , so i knew he was in good hands when i left for the course this morning , ’ he said			1
after 15 holes of his opening round , a small slice of history loomed for @entity2 , just three weeks shy of his attempt at a career grand slam at the masters			1
the world number one was swinging so smoothly he had hit all 15 greens in regulation			1
not once in any round in his @entity57 career has he hit all 18			2
no - one had done so at @entity4 since 1995			0
@entity5 hits an approach shot on the 16th hole during the first round of the @entity1 @entity2 hits an approach shot on the first hole during the first round at the @entity28 next up was the easiest hole on the course , the par five 16th			1
yet it was here the 25 year old contrived to undo all the good work that had gone before			0
as soon as his second shot left the club face he started laughing at himself in exasperated fashion			0
he knew what was coming next			0
the ball bounced on the bank at the front of the green and back into one of the course ’s many water hazards			2
there ended any hope of hitting all 18 greens in regulation			1
at least on the positive side , there were obviously plenty of excellent blows in those first 15 holes , and the reason he was only two under par at the time was he could n’t buy a putt , which would n’t have stressed him unduly given the shocking state of the @entity4 greens			2
suffice to say that they ’re nearer to municipal course standards than @entity100 ’s			0
@entity5 hits an approach shot on the 18th hole during the first round of the @entity1 @entity2 of @entity104 talks with caddie @entity105 on the fourth fairway in @entity107 , @entity35 at least @entity2 finished with a birdie for a 70 , which has n’t left him too far off the pace			1
‘ there were a lot of good signs out there and with this being my last event before @entity100 it ’s important to play well in the second round and get myself into contention at the weekend , ’ he said			0
elsewhere , @entity119 ’s welcome revival continued with a 68 which left him alongside such luminaries as world number three @entity122 , @entity124 and the @entity126 @entity125 , a former winner of this event			2
when @entity2 made his way to the first tee at a shade before 1pm he must have been heartened by the enormous crowd that had gathered			2
@entity2 of @entity104 hits his second shot on the fourth hole during the first round the entire length of the hole was lined several people deep and @entity2 gave them something to cheer with a couple of opening blows that gave him a good look at a birdie , with the putt coming up just short			1
the first three holes at @entity4 represent one of the toughest starts of any course on the @entity57 but @entity2 looked in the mood as he registered three easy pars			2
a chance was wasted at the par five fourth but he got into red figures with a classy birdie at the signature hole			0
@entity5 of @entity18 reacts to a missed putt for birdie on the 18th hole during the first round in @entity107 @entity2 of @entity104 hits his tee shot on the third hole during the @entity1 the par five 6th winds its way around a lake for all of its 500 plus yards but it held no fears for the @entity166 as he played a marvellous long iron second to 20ft and two putted for a birdie			1
another birdie followed at the short seventh but that was the last putt he holed until he got to the 18th			0
after that effort from 15ft dropped he disappeared for dinner with the tournament host			0
he could n’t keep the smile off his face when someone brought it up			0
‘ it ’s going to be a really special evening , ’ he said			0
@entity2 waves as he walks off the first green during the first round of the @entity1 @entity2 of @entity104 and @entity181 of the @entity182 walk off the first tee during the first round			2

@entity2 was swinging so smoothly he hit all 15 greens in regulation
but the world no 1 *messed* up the easiest hole on the course , the 16th
@entity5 ’s masters preparations were hardly ideal as his son fell ill
@entity6 was taken to a hospital with what turned out to be pneumonia
