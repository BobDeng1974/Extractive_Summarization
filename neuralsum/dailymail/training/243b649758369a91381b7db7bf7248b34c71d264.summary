by @entity0 slumped on his back with a sweet wrapper stuck to his wide face , this enormous orangutan appears to have overdone the bananas - and every other foodstuff within reach			2
the lethargic creature does n't look capable of much monkey business , although keepers at his @entity13 zoo maintain he is a healthy weight			1
@entity16 , who is also seen here clumsily hauling his gigantic body through a pool of water , is just 3ft 11in tall and tips the scales at a whopping 15st 10lbs			1
messy eater : super-sized @entity16 furrows his brow in confusion as he searches for his sweet wrapper the extra-large animal looks fascinatingly human as he scratches his head , seemingly pondering where his sweet has gone , while a telltale wrapper sticks to his chubby cheek			1
but the bulky animal survives on a healthy diet of fresh fruit and milk , according to @entity36 in @entity37			1

fish out of water : the 3ft 11in , 15st 10lbs creature cools off with a quick dip - but he hardly looks streamlined fat face : the startlingly human @entity16 seems to yawn and then frown as wide crevices form in his puffy features grumpy : the hairy beast stares moodily around his grassy enclosure , surely contemplating where his next meal will come from			1

@entity16 is 3ft 11in tall and weighs an *incredible* 15st 10lbs
