by @entity1 reporter published : 19:37 est , 9 july 2012 updated : 02:30 est , 10 july 2012 prosecutors have described how @entity4 teen @entity3 kicked 15 - year - old @entity6 's head ' as if it were a soccer ball and stomped on it as if he was putting out a fire ' in a shocking 2010 attack that left her almost dead			1
@entity3 , now 17 , cried during prosecutor @entity12 's opening statements at day one of his first - degree attempted murder trial today , which was attended by his parents and ms @entity6 's mother , @entity16			1
' he grabbed her head by the hair and started smashing it to the surface ... kicked her head as if it were a soccer ball and stomped on it as if he was putting out a fire , ' ms @entity12 told the court , according to @entity27			2
on trial : @entity3 , 17 , pictured right , cried as he listens to prosecutor @entity12 describe his attack defense attorneys said they would use the insanity defense , claiming @entity3 was suffering post traumatic stress disorder when he beat ms @entity6 to within an inch of her life at a bus stop outside @entity36 on march 17 , 2010			1
' he was generally a nice kid , but after his brother died , things changed , ' attorney @entity39 told the court			2
police said @entity3 , who is being tried as an adult , sought out ms @entity6 , then 15 , after she sent him text messages about his older brother @entity44 , who had recently killed himself			1
ms @entity6 suffered severe brain damage in the attack and spent over 40 days at the pediatric intensive care unit at @entity48			1
devastated : victim @entity6 's mother @entity16 , pictured left , broke down at monday 's trial opening cuffed : @entity3 , pictured , was led into the court handcuffed before opening statements in his first - degree attempted murder trial prosecution : assistant state attorney @entity12 , pictured , described how @entity3 ' stomped ' on ms @entity6 's head during the attack in 2010 he has been held without bond since the attack and faces up to five decades behind bars if convicted			1
mr @entity39 added that @entity61 meant the teenager struggled to control his emotions and actions			1
some of @entity3 's friends testified that they had received text messages about his intent to hurt ms @entity6 , but they thought he would n't go through with the crime			1
classmate , @entity69 , told the court that @entity3 texted him saying he would snap ms @entity6 's neck and ' stomp her head '			1
the teenager 's then girlfriend testified about a text message she said she received from him just after the assault			0
' he said , ' i just tried to kill someone , '' she testified on monday			0
if convicted , @entity3 could get 50 years in prison			2
if not , he likely would still spend years in a state mental institution , possibly even as long as he would spend in prison , attorneys and legal experts say			0
' they often have a difficult time getting out , ' said attorney @entity86 , who has represented defendants claiming the insanity defense and is not involved in the @entity3 case			2
he said few insanity defenses succeed because defendants not only must show a mental illness or defect but also must prove they did n't know right from wrong			0
parents : @entity3 's attorney @entity39 , right , speaks to @entity3 's mother @entity96 and step father @entity97 , left , in court horror : @entity3 ( left ) , now 17 , was 15 - years - old when police say he brutally kicked and stomped the head of then 15 - year - old @entity101 ( right ) so badly that she suffered permanent brain injuries ' that 's usually the prong that trips up most of the people who raise insanity as a defense , ' @entity86 said			1
' it 's fairly easy for the state to show someone knew right from wrong			0
they knew ' thou shalt not kill			0
'' @entity3 's defense claims he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder , rooted in his older brother 's recent suicide , when he became enraged outside the bus stop , by an exchange of text messages with ms @entity6 , whom he did not know			1
in one of the texts , ms @entity6 tells @entity3 ' now go visit your dead brother , ' leading @entity125 to respond , ' you 're ( expletive ) dead ! i swear to @entity128 , i 'm going to kill you			1
your ( expletive ) is cold , dead meat			0
' yet @entity3 threatened ms @entity6 several times during their 45 - minute text exchange before she mentioned the brother			1
the whole thing started because @entity3 was trying to get in touch with another girl , @entity136 , whom he had been dating			2
ms @entity6 sometimes let ms @entity136 use her phone to contact @entity3			1
tragedy : after @entity3 assaulted ms @entity6 , she was left lying unconscious in a pool of blood and still has mental problems after she gradually recovered strategy : @entity3 's attorneys said the teen , pictured , was insane when he assaulted the girl and should be acquitted of attempted first - degree murder ms @entity6 repeatedly referred to then - 15 - year - old @entity3 as a ' rapist ' for dating @entity148 , who was then 13			1
eventually @entity3 texts back , ' why are you trying to get yourself killed ? i will find you			0
i will mess you up , you will regret crossing me			0
' and , prosecutors say , @entity3 calmly laid plans to do just that over the next few hours			2
evidence shows that @entity3 - a gifted student who did not attend his high school that day - did computer searches on ways to efficiently kill people barehanded , wrote up a short will and hinted to several friends about his violent plans			2
' i 'm going to jail for murder , ' @entity3 said in one text to a friend , according to investigative records			2
most of the friends said they did n't take the threats seriously			0
' he 's never hurt anyone before and i would n't think he would ever hurt someone , ' said @entity171 , who received several texts from @entity3 that day			1
' mission ' : prosecutors say @entity3 dressed in black , including martial arts fighting gloves and his brother 's steel - toed boots to ensure maximum damage , before he beat ms @entity6 at a bus stop prosecutors say @entity3 dressed in black , including martial arts fighting gloves and his brother 's steel - toed boots to ensure maximum damage			1
he then rode his bicycle to the middle school and found @entity148 , asking her to take him to ms @entity6			0
surveillance video shows ms @entity136 leading the much taller @entity3 through a crowd of students at the school bus stop , a few moments after ms @entity6 also passed by			1
the beating itself is not captured on camera			0
numerous witnesses say @entity3 grabbed ms @entity6 by the neck , knocked her to the ground and began stomping and kicking her			1
a teacher managed to knock @entity3 away from the girl , who was by then lying unconscious in a pool of blood			0
the teacher , @entity202 , then hustled @entity3 into the school office and waited for police and paramedics to respond			0
mr @entity202 said it was clear immediately the attack was planned			0
' he was on a mission , ' he said			0
' i 'm going to kill you ' : the boy 's defence claims @entity125 ( bottom right ) was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder following his older brother 's recent suicide when he attacked ms @entity6 later in a videotaped police interview , @entity3 claimed he blacked out during the attack and that he never intended to hit ms @entity6			1
just before the investigator came into the interview room , however , @entity3 quietly says , ' i 'm a monster			0
' ms @entity6 gradually recovered but still has mental problems that prosecutors say may prevent her from testifying			2
@entity148 , the girl who pointed ms @entity6 out , faces an august trial on charges of being @entity3 's accomplice			1
for @entity3 's insanity defense to succeed , experts say it 's crucial that jurors are convinced he had been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder for some time after his brother 's suicide			2
in pretrial hearings , a defense expert has testified @entity125 likely was in period of detachment during which he did n't know what he was doing			0
those periods can last for hours or days , the expert said			0
' would never have happened ' : although @entity3 told police he blacked out during the attack and that he never intended to hit ms @entity6 , he earlier said quietly to himself , ' i 'm a monster ' in a taped jailhouse phone call with his mother , @entity3 says he is angry at his brother because the suicide messed up his head			1
' if it was n't for ( unclear ) , i 'd be just as normal as i ever was and this would never have happened , ' @entity3 says , according to a transcript			2
the prosecution 's job is easier , said @entity258 law professor @entity257			0
' the state has to keep reminding the jury that the defendant is ( an attempted ) killer , ' he said			0
' in the end , i think the defense fails in this case because lots of people lose a loved one and still function without engaging in a crime and jurors know that			0
' coincidentally , the attack on ms @entity6 happened several months after a group of students at the same school , @entity36 , set a classmate on fire , nearly killing him			2
three boys have been convicted of felonies in that case .			0

@entity286 told the court the teen could n't control his actions because he suffered @entity61 after his brother committed suicide
