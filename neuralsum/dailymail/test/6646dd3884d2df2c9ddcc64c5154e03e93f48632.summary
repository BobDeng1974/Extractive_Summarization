‘ the phenomenon has existed in the area for a few decades , ’ @entity50 , an engineer from the bureau told @entity52			2
he added that smoke often comes from under the ground on this hill in the spring and autumn			2
branches and grass that are held near the hole immediately catch fire from the intense heat experts think a coal seam may have spontaneously combusted below ground @entity66 , a supervisor from @entity67 , said there used to be more than a dozen of small coal mines in the area in the 1970s			1
‘ primitive mining and extinguishing techniques caused coal to burn deep under the ground , ’ said mr @entity66 in the same interview			1
