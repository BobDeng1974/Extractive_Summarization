the president of the @entity1 has denied agreeing for the national team to play in matches that others were preparing to fix			2
an undercover investigation by @entity7 's dispatches and @entity8 identified two people , one a licensed @entity11 agent and the other a @entity13 club official , who said they could fix friendly matches involving the national side , who are currently involved in the @entity17 , for Â£ 100,000			1
the report claimed that @entity1 president @entity19 had agreed for @entity13 to play in two proposed matches after the @entity17 , but he has denied that in an interview with the @entity22			1
let 's dance : @entity13 drew 2 - 2 with @entity24 on saturday at the @entity17 after an impressive performance ' the contents of the publication are not wholly true			1
' @entity19 told the @entity29 programme			2
' i was sent a press enquiry from the newspaper and i provided a full account of what transpired			2
it 's unfortunate that they did not report fully what i told them			0
' first of all i have not agreed to any match - fixing deal involving the @entity40			0
i was given a draft contract which i indicated to their agent that i had n't read and i also had some issues with it and so it will be premature for anybody to say the @entity40 is at fault			2
' the @entity8 reported that , during a meeting with an undercover reporter , @entity19 had said he was happy with a proposed contract for two friendly matches which would have seen match officials appointed by a bogus investment firm , a breach of @entity11 rules			1
but @entity19 said he did not read the contract and only submitted it to the @entity1 's lawyers to see if it was worth pursuing			0
centre of attention : the @entity13 squad in training on sunday ' i did n't read it at all ... i did not read the contract at all , ' he said			1
' they told me it was an investment company that was interested in buying the rights to our matches and that the matches will be organised by a @entity11 match agent ... ' when the draft contract was submitted to me it was forwarded to the lawyers to look at it because we need to know their position before we can sign			1
if they say okay , i read it to satisfy myself that all is okay			0
but i can not read it and decide on my own to sign without the ok from the lawyer and the committee			0
' when news of the investigation first broke on sunday night , the @entity1 issued a statement saying it had called in the police to investigate two people for misrepresentation			1
a statement from the @entity1 said : ' the @entity1 ( @entity1 ) has requested the @entity93 to investigate two persons for misrepresenting the @entity1 with an attempt to defraud			0
' the two were also allegedly filmed claiming that they would bribe @entity1 officials to ensure that the contract is signed			0
' we wish to state that the @entity1 did not sign the contract as we waited for the response from the legal committee and that the two gentlemen did not make such corrupt offers to the @entity1 or its officials			0
" we wish to assure the public that we will not tolerate such misrepresentations and we will seek strong sanctions against such individuals if such claims are found to be true			0
' @entity13 's hopes of progressing to the knock - out stages of the @entity17 are still alive after @entity113 's stoppage - time equaliser against the @entity114 on sunday night left everything to play for in @entity116 but @entity19 claimed the fixing scandal had been deliberately timed to hurt his country at the @entity17			1
' it is a well - orchestrated plan to punish the hard - won reputation of the @entity121 fa and also to try and devalue the participation of the country at the @entity17 and it 's not acceptable at all , ' he said			2

undercover investigation identifies two people who said they could fix games
one is a licenced @entity11 agent and the other is a @entity13 club official
no players from @entity13 , who are playing in the @entity17 , are involved
@entity13 must beat @entity113 in their last @entity116 clash to stand any *chance* of progressing to the last 16 of the *tournament* in @entity140
