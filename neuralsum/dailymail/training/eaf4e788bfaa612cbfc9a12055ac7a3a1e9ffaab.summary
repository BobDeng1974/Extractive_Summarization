@entity1 scientists have made a breakthrough in their fight against chlamydia and the damage the infection is inflicting on the koala population			1
scientists at the @entity9 have spent five years working on the vaccine for the sexually transmitted infection which has left koalas on the verge of extinction			1
the infection , which is rapidly being transmitted during birth and physical contact , is one of the main reasons the iconic @entity21 marsupials are now listed as endangered species			1
but researchers have successfully trialled the vaccine after observing wild koalas in the @entity26 , north of @entity27			1
sixty koalas were captured , tagged and monitored , while 30 animals receiving the vaccine and 30 remaining unvaccinated as a control group			2
@entity9 microbiologist professor @entity45 told @entity47 that they had successfully immunised the koalas and the results were promising			0
' what we wanted to do was capture koalas from the wild and find out two things , ' he told @entity47			0
scientists at the @entity9 have spent five years working on vaccine for chlamydia a koala being caught by a handler to be vaccinated ' the first thing was to cure the ones already infected and see if the vaccine has decreased the disease			1
' and secondly , we wanted to help prevent healthy koalas from getting infected in the future			0
â€™ mr @entity66 said the vaccine decreased chlamydia infection levels in the koalas who received the dose			2
' this large trial has confirmed that the vaccine is safe to give to not only captive koalas , but also koalas in the wild , ' he said			2
' we found a positive response and we know the vaccination is getting better and we 're going the right direction as well			0
' @entity9 microbiologist professor @entity45 ( right ) told @entity47 that the research team has successfully immunised the koalas and the results were promising mr @entity66 said the vaccine decreased chlamydia infection levels in the koalas who received the dose scientists have found a breakthrough for koalas to combat chlamydia and save them from being extinct the million dollar project allowed the research team to put a ' radio collar ' on each vaccinated koala to be able to keep track before releasing them back into the sanctuary			1
' the radio collars are worth $ 1000 each and they help us monitor and give samples of their health , ' he said			0
' they are really expensive and the project was heavily funded to make it all possible			0
the @entity21 iconic marsupials are currently listed as an endangered species in @entity21 the trial will extend for at least another year but mr @entity66 said the team wants to follow the animals for two more years			1
' we hope to specifically show a positive effect of the vaccine on disease , not just infection , as well as female reproductive rates , ' he said			0
' it 's a long process but it 's rewarding and we want to make a difference			0
