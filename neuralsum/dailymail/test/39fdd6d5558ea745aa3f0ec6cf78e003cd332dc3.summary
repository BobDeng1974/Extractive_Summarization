the @entity0 will be one weight on the mind of @entity2 on saturday , but the mercurial talents of a debutant capable of ‘ absolutely murdering anybody ’ will be another altogether			1
the world champion will have to negotiate both if he is to make history in @entity9			2
it is one of the quirks of this venue that no first - time winner has retained his title the next year			1
while that statistical curiosity has added an element of pressure to @entity2 , so too has the presence of @entity20 , one of four men making their first appearance in the main draw			1
@entity2 poses with the trophy after winning the @entity25 at the @entity26 in 2014 what an intriguing figure he is , a @entity28 based in @entity29 who was once a child star but has reached the age of 31 without making any great dents on the game			1
that appears to be changing with his recent appearance in the @entity37 semi-final , where he lost 6 - 3 to @entity38			2
he is one of only 21 players in history to have hit multiple 147 breaks in professional competitions			2
@entity20 ’s chances against the world no 1 appear slim in the extreme , but six - time runner up @entity46 told @entity47 : ‘ he has got one of the biggest talents i have seen in the game			1
if he produces his game he could absolutely murder anybody			0
let us see how he gets on against @entity38			0
he is the one who could produce something magical			0
he is very exciting and very attacking			0
if they go in he can beat anyone			2
’ @entity20 demonstrated those gifts in demolishing @entity57 10 - 1 in qualifying			1
but @entity2 ought to be a significantly different proposition , having won two titles this season ahead of his defence , which starts this morning			2
@entity2 ( above ) will face tournament debutant @entity20 in the first round on saturday @entity20 ( above lost to @entity2 in the semi-final of the @entity65 earlier this month @entity46 has tipped @entity2 as one of his ‘ three to watch , with @entity67 and @entity68 , my big favourite ’			1
referring to the hoodoo surrounding first - time winners , @entity2 said : ‘ it is a curse and it is going to be difficult but i will just try my best			1
it shows how difficult the tournament is to win			0
it is in the back of my mind , you ca n’t take that away			0
just to win it once as i did last year was a fantastic achievement for me but to win it twice and break the curse would be outstanding			0
‘ even if i was n’t defending champion i ’d be nervous			1
it would be wrong if you did n’t get butterflies because it is such a great tournament and such a great venue			0
but hopefully the nerves will inspire me and i ’ll play better			0
’ @entity68 begins his bid for a sixth world title against debutant @entity93 on tuesday .			0

@entity2 plays @entity20 in first round of the @entity96
@entity2 is the defending champion but no first - time winner has retained it
@entity46 told @entity101 can beat anyone on his day
