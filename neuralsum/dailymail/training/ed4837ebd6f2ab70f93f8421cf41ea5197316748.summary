by @entity0 published : 13:22 est , 8 december 2013 @entity2 : 13:24 est , 8 december 2013 with three in five of us claiming that seasonal stress is getting us down and , according to a new study , one in eight saying it 's worse than childbirth , the festive season takes its toll on the skin in more ways than one			1
but help for stressed skin is at hand in the shape of a new serum that claims to wipe out signs of stress , including wrinkles and dull skin , in just 21 days			1
according to makers skyn @entity24 , the plant peptides contained in their £ 40 @entity22 can also reduce stress induced cell damage , which causes sagging skin and fine lines , by up to 50 per cent			1
making things worse : stress can have a deleterious effect on your complexion - compounding the issue ' @entity34 contains a special @entity36 complex that instantly smoothes wrinkles , ' explains @entity38 , who created skyn @entity24 after being unable to find products that worked for her stressed , sensitive skin			1
' but the real power player in this serum comes from the two plant stem technologies			2
one is a plant peptide known as " plant collagen " that helps repair and protect skin 's dna			1
' it reduces stress induced cell damage by over 50 % , the type of damage that leads to wrinkles and sagging skin			1
' the other plant stem cell is extracted from raspberries and is antioxidant and anti-inflammatory			2
it specifically targets stress induced irritation and aging by regulating nitric oxide levels on skin			1
' along with creating wrinkles and dulling skin , according to skincare guru @entity69 , stress can also lead to poor eating habits which make matters even worse			1
before : skyn @entity24 's founder @entity38 says stress makes sagging and premature wrinkles worse after : the new £ 40 serum claims to erase premature ageing and eliminates skin problems caused by stress celebrity clients : @entity79 and @entity80 both turn to @entity69 when they need skincare advice solution : skyn @entity24 claim their @entity34 can improved stressed skin in just 21 days ' stress often makes us reach for all the wrong kinds of food , ' he reveals			1
' too much sugar and sodium are among the greatest enemies of skin			2
' sodium causes bloating and fluid retention in the skin ( puffy eye region ) , while an excess of sugar causes the skin to become red and rashy and causes eruptions			0
' another thing i have observed is when people are highly stressed they show more tension in the face and frown more			0
' despite @entity109 being just a few weeks away , @entity69 , whose celebrity clients include @entity80 and @entity79 , says there are some easy ways to reduce stress ahead of the big day			1
' stress can easily be avoided by organising your daily life , ' he explains			0
' first start by writing down a daily schedule or calendar for both personal and professional use because a better overview of things will make you feel more in charge			0
' you should n’t get up five minutes before a meeting - get up early and take your time to eat a good breakfast , connect with your family , and give yourself ample time to arrive early			2
' during the day , if you find yourself a little overwhelmed in your head or body , take five minutes to do some deep breathing ( closing your eyes ) and stretching , while allowing yourself to recharge your batteries			0
' take time for you with family and friends , exercise and make sure you laugh			0
' try to sleep for at least seven to @entity140 hours a night ' this not only helps you recharge and replenish but the body ’s own renewal happens at this time			0
sleep also helps to lower your cortisol levels , ' says @entity38			0
she adds : ' when cortisol is too high it has many negative effects on health including our skin			0
cortisol increases oil production and can break down skin collagen , the protein that keeps skin smooth and elastic			0
@entity160 ' i 've been doing yoga for 15 years and it saved me , ' @entity38 reveals			0
' it is not only an incredible way to release tension by stretching and relaxing the muscles but it also helps you slow down mentally			0
@entity169 into more turkey ' there 's a whole list of stress reducing foods including oranges , sweet potatoes , apricots , avocados , turkey , salmon and kale , ' she adds			2
' a @entity184 study in psychopharmacology found that vitamin c helps reduce stress and return blood pressure and cortisol to normal levels after a stressful situation			1
' @entity192 ' i have spa nights all the time and it 's amazing how restorative they can be			2
take a hot shower in the candlelight , play soothing music , slather on a face mask , have a hot cup of tea and crawl in bed with a good book			0
' @entity207 charge your skin for me , bad skin equals stress and vice versa			2
i think a lot of people feel this way which is why i created skyn @entity24 in order to reduce the signs of stress that eventually show up on our skin , because stress creates a vicious circle .			1
