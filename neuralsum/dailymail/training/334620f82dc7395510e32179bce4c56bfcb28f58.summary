by @entity0 from afar these intricate portraits appear to be painted using the finest of brushstrokes , but take a step closer and the amazing reality is unraveled : they 've been carefully crafted out of reels of folded fabric			1
these jaw - dropping creations by @entity10 - born artists @entity11 each contain 10 to 50 metres of tulle pleated , folded and finally ironed in place to create evocatively realistic images			1
‘ it was n’t until i saw a crumpled ball of tulle on my studio floor that i noticed its potential			2
' pressing it behind glass , various tones became apparent and i began to test out ways to create identifiable images by manipulating the pleats within the single piece , ’ he says			1
under the microscope : @entity41 's portrait ( eye shown above ) is crefted from one single length of tulle now there are 50 tulle portraits spread across the world from @entity48 and @entity49 to @entity10			1
as well as images of legends such as @entity52 , princess @entity53 and @entity41 , @entity11 has also created works of current icons including @entity56 and princess @entity57			1
the princess @entity57 portrait was unveiled at the @entity59 in @entity48 last year and is now exhibited at @entity48 's @entity60			0
@entity11 's tulle portrait of princess @entity53 - the fabric is bonded to the canvas using a household iron @entity56 ’s ' @entity66 ' portrait was unveiled on inauguration day at the @entity49 @entity68 and also became the official commemorative image on merchandise sold through @entity71 book stores across the @entity73			1
‘ the piece is made from a single decommissioned @entity73 flag , torn and re-woven into the image of the president , retaining the silhouette of the original flag and with all the pieces from it , ’ explains the artist			1
' " @entity66 " referenced the ideals of hope and change that @entity56 championed during his 2008/9 campaign			2
the piece is currently on loan to a private collector in the @entity73 , ’ @entity11 adds			2
a princess in the making : the artist starts by bunching 10 - 50 metres of tulle onto the canvas then moves it around , pressing and pleating into shape to create final portrait @entity11 ’s other wealthy private clients include @entity100 sheiks , sir @entity101 and his daughter @entity102			1
but there ’s one wealthy woman still on @entity11 ’s wish - list			1
‘ i would love to create a portrait of the @entity107 , ' he says			0
left : @entity11 's portrait of princess @entity57 was unveiled at the @entity59 in @entity48 last year			1
right : the carefully folded tulle up - close another private client to own one if these enchanting pieces is ex-model @entity121 whose husband , businessman and philanthropist @entity110 ( brother of @entity113 boss @entity112 of @entity114 ) , commissioned the portrait as a surprise for her 30th birthday			2
‘ my reaction when i saw it was , “ wow ! ” , ’ says the stunning mum - of - two			0
‘ it was an amazing gift			0
’ private collector @entity121 in front of her tulle incarnation : the stunning ex-model received the piece as a surprise from her husband on her 30th birthday and when friends and family see the piece they are equally stunned			0
‘ people are always amazed by how lifelike it is and wonder how it can be created out of one piece of material , ’ she says			0
‘ a portrait of yourself is very personal but the way @entity11 captured me is spot on , ’ adds @entity121			2
‘ but when i look at it i see a piece of art rather than just a portrait of me			0
’ so can the artist reveal how he creates magic from scrunched up fabric ? artist @entity11 in action with his trusty tool -- a household iron -- creating his ' hands of @entity161 ' piece ‘ firstly the uncut length is piled onto a canvas as a dense voluminous layer , ’ he says			1
‘ once entirely covered , i take a deep breath and go for it ! ‘ i move the tulle around , pressing , pleating and bunching it to form the basic tones and textures			0
‘ this initial placement sets up the entire process before i focus on the detail			0
then the tulle is bonded to the canvas using a hot iron , ' reveals the artist			1
‘ i always envisaged building a diverse body of work with this medium but subsequently became inundated with portrait commissions ! ’ he says			0
the finished ' hands of @entity161 ' piece commissioned for @entity184 ‘ the final piece remains three - dimensional , set back behind glass , ’ @entity11 adds			1
‘ initially the portraits were simply a test - bed for the technique -- i felt if i could create an accurate likeness , then anything else could be possible			2
' @entity193 's portrait of @entity56 ( left ) woven using an @entity73 flag ( up - close right ) and last year , @entity197 ’s creative director @entity196 also came knocking			1
‘ initially i thought he wanted me to create something as a backdrop to a show or for their stores but when i learned he wanted me to create the pieces as clothing , it really pushed the limit , ' he admits			0
the artist crafted this portrait of @entity52 , called ' fame ' , from 15 metres of fabric ‘ i had to create the detailed faces at a much smaller scale than anything i had done before , but in doing so it opened up a whole new realm of possibility , ’ says the artist			2
the one - of - a - kind pieces were made - to - order from @entity197 ’s @entity220 salons			0
another of his most challenging commissions was an installation for @entity184 , called ‘ @entity225 ’ featuring two clasped hands			0
‘ it was tricky because of its size , ’ he explains			0
talk about a big pile of ironing : the 36 - year - old artist presses this provate commission of a @entity235 ‘ “ @entity240 ” showed me the free - flowing nature of the fabric was as interesting as the detail i was manipulating			1
‘ so the current series i ’m now working on explores a more instinctive , looser approach that shifts the focus from the perfected image to the more ambiguous , abstract and expressive form that ’s guided by the natural flow of the material itself , ’ @entity11 explains			2
this series of tulle works will be exhibited at @entity250 in @entity10 , where he currently has some pieces on show			1
@entity41 hanging in the @entity253 , a private health club in @entity10 so how long does it take @entity11 to carefully fold and pleat the tulle into its final incarnation ? ‘ i tend to work on several pieces at one time so i do n’t time them by the hour , but i like to work and live with each portrait for several months			1
deciding the colours is a process in itself			0
‘ sometimes a colour can has a particular relevance , but most often i will do several tests in different colours before deciding which one works , ’ he says			0
@entity11 's was commissioned by @entity197 to use his method to create haute couture pieces for the brand @entity11 's work has been exhibited in galleries including @entity49 @entity68 , the @entity273 and the @entity274			2
currently the tulle pieces are available through @entity276 and @entity48 and his @entity277 is exhibited at @entity278 , a private health club in @entity10			1
a more fluid approach give @entity11 's latest works an ethereal quality @entity11 is now hard at work on his new series as well as other projects			2
‘ i ‘ m always interested in creating something new , something people have n’t seen or experienced before , something that inspires the reaction how ? or wow ! , ' says the artist			0
well , wow - ed we certainly are			0
details of future exhibition and where my work can be seen will be published on my website @entity296 @entity298 's latest series explores a loser approach to create abstract , but equally enchanting , works of art			0
