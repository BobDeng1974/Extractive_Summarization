the illegal drug ketamine could be used to treat severe depression , new research shows an illegal drug has successfully been used to treat @entity5 patients with serious depression			1

some were suffering from unremitting depression that had plagued them for years despite various drugs and talking therapies			0
although many patients taking part in the trial at @entity19 relapsed within a day or two , almost 30 per cent showed improvements lasting at least three weeks			1

but the doses used in the patient trial were much lower than those on the street and side effects were minimal , even though the drug was injected rather than swallowed			2
psychiatrist dr @entity45 , from @entity46 , said : ‘ @entity24 is a promising new antidepressant which works in a different way to existing antidepressants			1
‘ we wanted to see whether it would be safe if given repeatedly and whether it would be practical in an @entity5 setting			0
we especially wanted to check that repeated infusions did n't cause cognitive problems			0
’ he added : ‘ we 've seen remarkable changes in people who 've had severe depression for many years that no other treatment has touched			2
it 's very moving to witness			0
‘ patients often comment that that the flow of their thinking seems suddenly freer			2

‘ we now need to build up clinical experience with ketamine in a small number of carefully monitored patients			0
‘ by trying different infusion regimes and adding other licensed drugs , we hope to find simple ways to prolong its dramatic effect			0
’ the government announced last month that it planned to reclassify ketamine			0
