mr @entity1 , who uncovered the 2006 cash - for - honours inquiry , said : ‘ i ’m glad these recent revelations are being given the attention they deserve			2
‘ while the @entity5 concede the @entity26 is outdated and undemocratic they continue to stuff it with cronies			2
‘ the @entity2 ’s long - standing position is that we believe those making laws should be elected by the people , and therefore we do not nominate members to the @entity26			1
’ @entity4 , a close ally of @entity34 , quit the @entity5 last month after calling for @entity35 to be replaced as leader			1
in his resignation statement he said : ‘ my efforts to expose and end cash for peerages in all parties , including our own , and help get the @entity26 elected , have failed			2
’ his comments prompted mr @entity1 to write to @entity3 and urge investigators to return to the thorny issue once again			1
assistant commissioner @entity46 replied to say that the letter has been passed to mr @entity19 in the force ’s @entity48			0
the officer was in charge of the 2006 investigation which saw a sitting prime minister interviewed by police for the first time when @entity56 was questioned as a witness			1

hints : @entity4 said his resignation statement that he had ' failed ' in his efforts ' to expose and end cash for peerages in all parties , including our own ' mr @entity1 , mp for the @entity70 , is a fierce critic of the @entity26 and said the forthcoming vote on independence could rid people north of the border of its cost			1
he added : ‘ if the rest of the @entity78 want to keep funding the @entity26 , it is a matter for them			0
‘ a yes vote would mean that people in @entity82 could get rid of the expensive and unrepresentative @entity84 tier – saving around £ 50m a year in not sending mps and peers to @entity87			0
’ @entity5 funding has fallen sharply since they went into government and the party has become increasingly reliant on big donations			1
earlier this month it emerged how the party ’s three biggest donors – who have provided two - fifths of all the party ’s donations – have been given peerages by deputy prime minister @entity35			1
the three @entity26 – @entity101 magnate @entity100 , @entity103 founder @entity102 and clothes tycoon @entity105 – donated around £ 600,000 between them			0
they are among 34 @entity5 who have been given life peerages by mr @entity35 since the 2010 election – compared with an average of only four a year between 1997 and 2009			0
this is despite his complaints that the @entity26 is undemocratic and should be fully elected to stop politicians stuffing it with cronies			0
earlier this month mr @entity35 denied that anything improper has taken place and insisted the claims are demeaning to wealthy donors			2
he said businessmen were ‘ perfectly ’ entitled to give the @entity5 huge sums and it is unfair to suggest they should not then be made peers			0
