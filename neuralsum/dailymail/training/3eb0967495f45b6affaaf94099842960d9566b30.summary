dr @entity1 , 54 , left a mixture of bacon , tuna and slug pellets on a roofing slate placed by a tree			1
but instead of ridding the garden of vermin , his concoction proved irresistible to @entity19 , a silver tabby , who was found foaming at the mouth with her back arched in agony			1
@entity25 claimed the inventor , who patented medical lighting equipment for hospitals , had once told them he did not like having wildlife in his garden			1
@entity19 ’s devastated owner @entity32 , 41 , hit out after the wealthy scientist was ordered to pay costs but escaped any other sentence			1

she was only 18 months old and what happened to her was terrible			0
she was a lovely cat with a lovely nature			2
‘ the chap would openly say to me he did n’t want any wildlife living in the area – but what i ca n’t understand was why he then bought a property with all that land			0

’ mr @entity32 , a dog breeder and kennel owner , said the baited roofing slate had been left propped against a tree on the boundary he shares with @entity1 in the village of @entity65 , @entity66			1
he added : ‘ he is quite in his rights to kill rats in a contained way but where he put the poison was near the public right of way			1
a child could have picked it up and plenty of families walk through there			0
it just seems a shabby , dirty and cruel trick – knowing we have all the animals			0
