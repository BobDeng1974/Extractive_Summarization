we all have a favourite ' photo face ' or pose , the expression / shape that we pull when someone whips out a camera in a bid to avoid unflattering social media snaps			2
sadly , we 're not always quick enough to get into position before a picture is taken that may haunt us in the online realm forever			0
and that 's because they have perfected a pose that makes them look their best from most angles , and they execute it every time a lens is trained upon them			2
@entity39 were keen to discover if we could master the a-listers ' perfect posture and test whether or it really does make you look good wearing anything			1
we called on a posing coach and posture expert to teach our writer @entity49 the tricks of the trade			1
@entity51 , a yoga and postural expert from @entity54 , whose clients include the @entity56 , @entity58 @entity57 and @entity59 , gave @entity39 an insight into each celebrity 's pose before assisting @entity49 in perfecting each one			1
one glance at a photograph of @entity18 , 40 , posing nonchalantly on the red carpet and it looks pretty simple , right ? wrong			1
look a little closer and you 'll notice the pose - the lean back , one leg out and a slight head tilt			2
and it 's not a one off			0
@entity18 has spent years mastering her signature pose - and you 'll notice it 's the same at every photo opportunity			1
she 's been at it for years ! obviously @entity18 feels the pose works for her , she 's been doing for five years			2
to achieve it , the slender designer pushes one hip - usually the right - out to the side to create an angular s - shaped curve with her body the pose - known to every catwalk model and celebrity in the business - is engineered to achieve the slimmest possible silhouette , while showing off clothes to their best advantage			1
and @entity18 has it nailed			0
' @entity18 has a lovely pose , ' says @entity51			1
' i ca n't see any postural difficulties with @entity18 , which means she 's been trained well			0
she has mastered the anterior tilt of the pelvis , where the lumber curve of lower back is reduced			0
' @entity51 explains that by posing in this way , the figure is accentuated , improving the lower back curve and enhancing the glutes			1
to achieve it , the slender designer pushes one hip - usually the right - out to the side to create an angular s - shaped curve with her body			2
her left foot is stepped slightly in front and crossed over the right , slimming her silhouette , enhancing the curve of her body and bringing her legs down to a neat point			2
her right shoulder is pushed down and back , accentuating the ' couture curve ' of her body , and her right arm is held behind her to narrow the profile further			2
her head is always held straight and high to elongate her neck , her chin tipped down to slim the face , or held up and back to create a firm , youthful jawline and lengthen the neck			0
before and after : @entity39 writer @entity49 is pictured , left , before attempting the @entity128 pose and , right , after			1
@entity51 taught her how to perfect the anterior tilt of the pelvis , where the lumber curve of lower back is reduced			1
@entity51 explains that by posing in this way , the figure is accentuated , improving the lower back curve and enhancing the glutes , right ( dress by www.wantherwardrobe.com ) @entity25 is another celebrity who always manages to look picture perfect thanks to her signature pose			1
the singer , 33 , has mastered the ' double grab ' , which @entity51 says exudes confidence and draws attention to her petite waist			2
placing her hands on her hips helps flatter her arms and the slight lift of her pubic bones steadies her centre , says @entity51			2
' her stance is so well centred that it highlights her hourglass figure perfectly and makes her look graceful and feminine , ' she added			0
hourglass : @entity25 , 33 , has mastered the ' double grab ' , which @entity51 says exudes confidence and draws attention to her petite waist making like @entity25 : @entity49 tested out @entity25 's pose and loved how it made her dress , arms and stomach , look far more shapely ( dress by @entity163 for @entity164 ) @entity24 has adopted a pose similar to @entity166 @entity25 's			1
the @entity168 judge does , however , place one hand higher on her hips on one side			0
this , says @entity51 , helps to add curves and definition to her petite frame			2
' as always , @entity24 looks lovely and effortless , but a fair amount of work goes into looking this good on the red carpet			1
' notice she knocks her right knee in , and weakens her outer thigh , adding shape to her physique and making her body " pop "			2
' hippy : @entity186 always puts on hand higher on one side of her hip , which @entity51 says makes her body ' pop ' - she also puts more weight on one leg , which flatters them adding shape : @entity49 tested out @entity24 's signature pose and , as you can see from the after snap , right , it gave her body more shape and flattered her legs ( dress by @entity201 for @entity202 ) as one of the world 's most photographed women , @entity26 has got her pose down			1
clearly designed to highlight her shapely derriere , the 33 - year - old reality tv star often poses by looking over her shoulder , with her back arched and hand on placed on her lower back , just above her iconic bottom , or coyly placed on her cheek			0
' @entity26 's pose is just fabulous , ' mused @entity51			1
' the key here is activating her thoracic ( mid back ) , by arching it slightly and making it look more curved			0
this also helps to extend the upper portion of her spine			0
' by glancing over her shoulder , she is clearly showing off what she sees as her best side			0
' @entity26 clearly knows how to work her best angles			0
she 's been showcasing the over-the - shoulder pose since her first appearance on the red carpet - and it 's still working a treat			1
keeping up with @entity26 : clearly designed to highlight her shapely derriere , @entity26 often poses by looking over her shoulder , with her back arched , showing off her shapely behind to perfection shaping up : while @entity49 is n't blessed with a bottom like @entity26 's , @entity51 taught her how to make the most of hers - although it took her a few attempts to pull off the over-the - shoulder stance with aplomb ( dress by www.wantherwardrobe.com ) giving @entity26 a run for her money is showbiz stalwart @entity243 , who has mastered her red carpet pose : the left lean			1
speaking about the 45 - year - old 's pose , @entity51 said : ' her standing leg is hyper - extended ( or locked at the knee ) , which strengthens the legs and makes them appear longer and more toned			1
' she also engages her core by leaning slightly to the left , lifting her pelvic floor and engaging her lower abdominal muscles			0
this pose takes some serious practice but it really pays off			0
' altogether , this stabilises her body and cultivates confidence			0
' left lean : @entity243 has perfected her pose , which sees her lean to the left , extend her leg out and exude some serious confidence like @entity263 : @entity49 , pictured before and after , loved pulling off @entity243 's pose and felt it highlighted her curves and made the dress look much better ( dress by @entity269 ) a celebrity who @entity51 feels does n't quite master the perfect pose is @entity272 , whose awkward pose matches her taste for avant garde fashion			1
@entity51 said : ' how very strange this pose is ! her shoulders are hunched up , she needs to roll the shoulders away from her ears and release the shoulders downwards , opening the chest			1
' she should rotate the upper arms externally , to avoid " penguin " arms , which closes the chest and makes her appear less confident			0
' as for her knees , they appear to be knocking together			0
she needs to place the feet hip width wide before bending the front leg knee , to keep her body grounded			0
' odd : @entity272 has an awkward pose that matches her taste for avant garde fashion			0
@entity51 said : ' how very strange this pose is ! her shoulders are hunched up , which makes her appear insecure ' unimpressed : @entity49 felt she looked better before attempting the @entity272 pose - and certainly wo n't be trying this one out at the next photo opportunity ( dress by www.wantherwardrobe.com ) find your feet : imagine you are standing on a trampoline			1
ground the four corners of your feet into the earth and unlock your knee joints , as if the earth feels springy beneath you			0
@entity308 : slightly bend your knees , which will activate the leg muscles and therefore give more shapely legs @entity312 pelvis : tilt the pelvis forward and back , like a belly dancer , and find the middle place between the two : this will stabilise the centre and begin to active the core @entity319 : this will loosen the lumbar ( lower back ) curve and give you a beautiful shape , which will enhance your glutes activate the @entity328 : draw the navel to the spine , gently draw your lower belly inwards , on exhalations , slightly lift the pelvic floor on exhalations @entity335 : lift the ribcage above the pelvis , elevate the heart and line up the pelvic floor with the crown of the head shift weight from foot to foot , @entity344 : this will realign the body and awaken energy , unlocking knees breathe ! ! ! ! ! ! especially exhalations out of the mouth to release stress roll shoulders back , @entity353 : open the chest and smile from armpit to armpit rotate the @entity356 , to open chest : present yourself to the world , avoid the ‘ penguin ’ effect @entity51 , yoga and posing coach hosts specialist retreats at @entity54 resorts in yoga that promise to improve your posture			1
