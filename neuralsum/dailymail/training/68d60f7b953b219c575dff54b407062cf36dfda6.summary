by @entity0 hotels in the notorious party resort of @entity3 are set to kick out a record number of yob @entity6 holidaymakers this year			1
nearly 100 troublemakers have been asked to leave already this season for smashing up rooms , fighting with guests or assaulting staff			1
and hotel bosses are promising to get even tougher with unruly tourists after the rowdy @entity15 resort made headlines around the world over a video of a @entity6 teenager performing a sex act on 24 men in a bar for free booze			1
troublemakers : almost 100 brits have been thrown out of hotels in @entity3 this year party capital : @entity3 has been caught in the spotlight since the video footage emerged ( file picture ) a local hotel association has revealed 92 of the 107 people members have kicked out so far this year have been @entity6			1
the other 15 were @entity34			0
the shocking figures put @entity3 on course to break its record of expulsions , 254 last year and up from 147 in 2012 and 166 in 2011			1
the vast majority of those asked to leave in previous years , like this year , were @entity6			2
and around 35 per cent of the area 's hotels do not belong to the association which released the figures today , meaning the real number is likely to be slightly higher			1
@entity45 , vice president of the @entity46 , which covers the two sister resorts , said : ‘ the vast majority of the expulsions are down to three reasons			0
support : emergency services workers attend to a tourist who has passed out on a bench on the @entity56 strip in @entity3 after a night out a major events firm has announced it is pulling out of scandal - hit resort @entity3			1
@entity59 said this will be its final summer of running open - air gigs at its eponymous hotel in the party destination			2
@entity66 , founder of the firm 's owner @entity69 , said : ‘ our strategic agenda has changed and the time is right for us to move on at the end of the summer season			2
‘ we are really proud of what we have brought to the @entity15 resort of @entity3 but we are pulling out of the resort in september			1
’ it is understood the decision to cease activity in @entity3 was taken before the furore broke out over footage of a 21 - year - old @entity34 girl performing a sex act on 24 men in a bar			1
but it is likely to compound fears voiced by nightlife workers of an exodus by big tour operators following the controversy			0
managers , djs , reps and bar staff , most of them @entity6 , claim that they have all been tarred with the same brush over the actions of one independent pub crawl organiser			0
and they complained that local authorities are targeting bars that bring money to @entity15 rather than tackling problems such as street prostitution and muggings			0
‘ the first is guests damaging hotel furniture , kicking doors down , smashing mirrors and even throwing tvs out of their rooms			1
‘ the others are fights with other guests and verbal and physical attacks on hotel staff			2
‘ the vast majority are always @entity6 men , aged between 18 and 25			0
‘ we want young people who come to enjoy themselves but within a context of respect towards other guests			0
‘ we wo n't tolerate people whose fun comes from antisocial behaviour which causes others to suffer			0
‘ it 's got to be fun within certain limits			2
‘ virtually all the problems we 're experiencing are connected to the misuse of drugs and alcohols and obviously we 'd urge these youngsters to take care			0
’ troublemakers are put on a temporary black list so hoteliers know not to accept them			2
mr @entity140 explained : ‘ the association sends round an email with the name of the person that 's been expelled so other members are pre-warned			2
‘ we cover 20,000 hotel beds in @entity3 and @entity148 so it is a very effective measure			1
‘ it 's only information that 's kept for a few days and not on a long - term basis			0
‘ most of the people that are expelled for bad behaviour promise they wo n't do it again but we usually find a lot of them have already caused trouble before			0
‘ where there 's been vandalism hoteliers try to get compensation from those who 've caused it but it 's very difficult in practice			0
drunken : a woman can be seen passed out on a kerb in @entity3 , which has been blighted by scandal collapsed : a man lies sprawled on the pavement next to a @entity3 bar as his friend tries to look after him ‘ usually we try to avoid getting the police involved unless it 's very serious			1
’ several hotels in the area have hired private security to address the problem			0
one hotel boss said : ‘ it 's not that the problem has necessarily got worse but more that hotels are taking a tougher approach			1
‘ in many cases hotels now employ external security staff rather than depending on a night - time caretaker and a sole security guard they mostly employed themselves			0

nearly 100 troublemakers have been *evicted* from @entity3 hotels this year
@entity194 is on course to break 2013 's 254 brits thrown out
