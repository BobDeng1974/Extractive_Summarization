by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 15:03 est , 8 may 2012 updated : 17:21 est , 8 may 2012 dangerous wood - eating termites that can destroy trees and damage homes are the latest infestation to turn up in @entity8			1
the @entity9 corniger termite are native to the @entity11 but have now joined the 20 or so other species of termites which live in the @entity14			1
the pesky insects are the latest unusual species found in southern @entity8 along with @entity18 rats , @entity20 pythons , and poisonous caterpillars			1
not welcome : the @entity9 corniger termite , which is native to the @entity11 , have been found in southern @entity8			1
they feast on hard wood and build tunnels up the outside of houses the arrival of the termite poses a particular problem because they feast on hardwood , foraging on trees , garden furniture and attack the outside wall of homes			1
the termites differ from @entity8 's other species because they are found above ground and can fly - making it easier for them to establish new nests			1
as well as milllions of termites , @entity8 boasts a menagerie of animals you 'd be best to avoid : the so - called sunshine state has four types of poisonous caterpillars whose sting can cause humans to pass out in pain			1
beware the saddleback caterpillar , the puss caterpillar , the io caterpillar and the hag caterpillar			2
southern @entity8 's crocodiles , which grow up to 14 feet , have multiplied 10-fold in the last 40 years			1
there are about 1,500 of the reptiles			2
a growing population of @entity20 pythons are threatening to wipe out large numbers of raccoons , opossums and other small mammals in the @entity67 area			2
huge @entity69 pouch rats , which grow up to nine pounds , have been found on @entity8 's @entity70 despite efforts to eradicate them			1
boa constrictors , @entity74 monitor lizards , and vervet monkeys have also wreaked havoc on local animal species			1
they build tunnels running up the outside of houses and trees where they create beach ball sized nests weighing up to 28 kilograms			2
and a single nest could hold more than a million termites , @entity85 , professor of entomology at the @entity87 , told the @entity90			2
' they love to eat hardwoods			2
they ate the handles off garden implements , rakes and hoes — turned them into shredded wheat			2
if this thing really keeps going , it 's going to be a problem for tropical @entity8 , from @entity102 to the @entity103 , ' warned @entity85			1
he worries that the new species could increase the amount of termites in the @entity108 region by as much as 30 per cent			1
but agricultural officials are determined to stamp out the plague of termites before they spread any further			2
currently the species have only been spotted in 42 properties in @entity108			1
however , this translates to an infestation of up to 120 colonies meaning there are already 100 million in the area			2
properties in @entity108 were treated today in a bid to banish the insects although efforts to eradicate them will be spread over four days			2
' they got into the tool shed and ate our stack of firewood , ' resident @entity123 told the @entity90			2
' we went to pick it up and there was no wood left			2
my trees look like they 're almost dead , ' she added			0
' out - of - control hysterical ' : the io caterpillar is one of four types of venomous caterpillars to release toxins with the slightest touch that can cause people to pass out from pain ' on fire ' : a saddleback caterpilalr ( pictured ) has been known to bring the worst pain of the four kinds of stinging caterpillars in @entity8 that is like having a ' bee sting times a hundred ' last month venomous caterpillars that use their spines to attack were the latest threat to the region			1
dr @entity156 , medical director of the @entity157 in @entity158 , told the @entity90 newspaper that although the center has not seen any deaths from caterpillar stings , they have gotten hundreds of calls for help with people ' out - of - control hysterical			2
' ' it 's a very painful sting , ' dr @entity156 told the newspaper			0
' we even see people pass out from the pain			0
' the four types of caterpillars with the awful venom include the saddleback caterpillar , the puss caterpillar , the io caterpillar and the hag caterpillar			0
when they attack humans , the venom can be unbearable , particularly if the saddleback releases its poison			0
@entity8 resident @entity183 told the @entity90 : it 's like somebody lit you on fire			1
' he went on to say : ' a bee sting times a hundred			0
' the species is most threatening around this time of year in @entity8 as the weather starts to get warmer			1
eggs begin to hatch and the caterpillars grow to become moths			0
some people , although rare , can have an allergic reaction to the toxins			0
and are encouraged to call 911 or go to hospital			0
they can experience vomiting , shortness of breath and other reactions			0
others with less severe attacks can be treated at home by calling @entity207			0
scotch tape can be placed over the wounded area and stripped off over and over again to remove the spines from within the skin			0
although their poison is painful , the caterpillars are not looking to harm anyone or anything			0
@entity216 , assistant professor of entomology at the @entity87 , told the @entity90 that they are merely trying to protect themselves			0
the venom is used as the caterpillars ' predators , like birds and lizards			0
mr @entity216 said : if you 're a caterpillar , you have a very challenging life because everything wants to eat you			0
' they 're not trying to hurt you			0
they 're doing it to avoid being eaten			0
' @entity8 has become a popular new home for interesting creatures , including crocodiles that can grow up to 14 feet long			1
protection : the hag caterpilalr is also poisonous as it tries to protect itself from birds , lizards and other attackers that can eat them and prevent them from becoming a moth coexist : officials urge people to leave the venomous species , like the puss caterpillar , alone as they are not trying to hurt people with their poison that could provoke an allergic reaction to humans the reptiles have multiplied 10-fold in the last 40 years in south @entity8 with about 1,500 crocodiles			1
but now they face a new challenge in the area because most of the places they used to call home are now inhabited by humans			0
humans in @entity8 also have to worry about huge pythons that are wiping out the state 's mammal populations			1
a burgeoning population of @entity20 pythons — many of them pets that were turned loose by their owners when they got too big — appears to be wiping out large numbers of raccoons , opossums , bobcats and other mammals in the @entity67 , according to a study from the proceeding of the @entity274			0
here to stay ? : once crocodiles decide on a place to live , it 's difficult to get them to move meaning people in @entity8 might have to get used to having the species listed as ' threatened ' by wildlife officials the study found that sightings of medium - size mammals are down dramatically — as much as 99 percent , in some cases — in areas where pythons and other large , non-native constrictor snakes are known to be lurking			1
scientists fear the pythons could disrupt the food chain and upset the @entity67 ' environmental balance in ways difficult to predict			0
another species that has threatened the state 's environment are giant @entity69 pouch rats that have been found on @entity8 's @entity70 despite concerted efforts by conservation officials to eradicate them			1
officials worry that the voracious rats , which grow to nine pounds , might wipe out some crops and upset the delicate ecological balance if they manage to reach the @entity8 mainland			1
another creature : crocodiles are n't the only ones taking over in @entity8 as burmese pythons invaded the area the @entity69 rat first appeared on @entity70 in 1999 after eight rats escaped from a local exotic pets breeder			1
' we thought we had them whipped as of 2009 , ' @entity313 , exotic - species coordinator for the @entity314 , told keysnet.com			1
' in the early part of 2011 , a resident e-mailed me and said he saw one of the rats			0
we were skeptical but went back and talked to people and [ saw ] there were rats that we missed , ' he added			0
animals love @entity8 : @entity18 rats the size of cats have also taken up the warm state as their new home concern : officials worry that the voracious rats , which grow to nine pounds , might wipe out some crops and upset the delicate ecological balance after four female rats were found in 2011 , officials unsuccessfully launched another effort to kill them in november and december , primarily through the use of poison - laced cantaloupe and peanut butter			1
and it might become difficult to control crocodiles ' interaction with humans if that population continues to grow			0
crocodiles tend to stick to an area they decided they will live in now matter how much they have moved			0
so even if they leave a particular spot they chose as their own for weeks and travel far away , they are likely to return			0
they will likely continue to be one of the many species like boa constrictors , @entity74 monitor lizards , vervet monkeys and more to join the state - and wreak havoc on local animal species .			1

a new species of wood - eating termite , native to the @entity11 , has arrived in @entity8
