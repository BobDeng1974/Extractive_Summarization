thirty nine of the 40 jockeys who rode in last month 's @entity2 at @entity3 are to face a charge over their conduct at the start			1
the riders , including 19 - time champion @entity8 plus senior colleagues @entity9 , @entity11 and @entity12 , are accused to attempting to line up before requested to do so by the official starter			1
the incident under scrutiny also saw starter ’s assistant @entity16 being knocked over			1
controversy : the field line up for the start of the @entity2 but 39 of the 40 jockeys have now been charged what a performance : @entity22 proved a winner for the bookies as he defied 25 - 1 odds big - race pilot : @entity28 punches the air after landing his biggest career win the start of the most watched race in the @entity34 calendar once again showed racing in a poor light with the runners having to be re-called after a false start , although this is not part of the enquiry			1
however , the @entity41 will not pursue any action against the jockeys for their subsequent ‘ mutiny ’ when , with many of the @entity47 riders needing to leave to reach connections home , they refused to co-operate with a reconvened enquiry			2
@entity50 , director of raceday operations and regulation for @entity41 , said : ‘ managing the start of the @entity2 and dealing with any incidents that occur during this process presents a unique challenge			1
' after reviewing all the available evidence we have taken the decision not to pursue any charges relating to the fact that we were unable to complete the @entity62 ’ enquiry on the day			0
‘ this is also a reflection of the scale of the challenge in conducting an enquiry in such circumstances			0
' instead , we would like to put in place a protocol , to be developed in conjunction with the jockeys , for managing such situations where a large numbers of riders are involved			2
going nowhere : race officials wave flags to signal a false start at @entity3 @entity78 , wet , wet : @entity79 ( centre ) ridden by @entity81 stumbles badly at the @entity82 ‘ having reviewed all of the available evidence and footage into the incident prior to the start of the @entity2 it is the view of @entity41 that 39 of the 40 riders in the race attempted to line up or take a position before being instructed to do so , which was before the off time of the race			1
‘ if the @entity103 finds that this is the case then this would constitute an offence under the @entity106			0
“ it is also @entity41 ’s view that the riders then moved forward towards the start and in the process knocked down the assistant starter , who was positioned in front of the field , advising the riders not to line up			1
this will also be considered by the @entity103			0
‘ this all occurred after riders in the @entity2 had been briefed in advance of the race about conduct at the start , which emphasised the obligation under the @entity106 for the riders to obey the @entity98 ’s instructions			1
‘ the @entity103 will now determine whether any of the riders in question are in breach of the @entity106			0
‘ we acknowledge the length of time taken to reach these conclusions			0
by working with the jockeys to develop a protocol for dealing with such cases we would expect to avoid a similar scenario in the future			2
’ ouch : @entity128 and @entity129 crash out but both horse and rider were unhurt on the run : the @entity2 field race past the packed grandstand in response , @entity135 , chief executive of the @entity136 , said his members would vigorously defend the charges			1
he added : ‘ we are disappointed that the @entity41 has decided to lay charges against the jockeys in specific relation to the start			2
the decision by the @entity41 not to progress with charges in relation to subsequent events is entirely unsurprising given the procedural failings that followed the running of the @entity2			2
‘ having reviewed the footage , read the transcript and listened to the audio recording of the inquiry and being aware of numerous other facts , we believe that the jockeys have strong grounds to contest the charges			0
‘ however , with so many jockeys charged we have been unable to take formal instruction at this stage and can not therefore confirm what their collective or individual positions will be in relation to the charges			1
in the clear : @entity22 was five lengths clear of his rivals as he crossed the line @entity171 : @entity22 leads the field up the run - in in front of the packed stands ‘ it was and remains our belief that the appropriate course of action would have been a forward - looking , collegiate approach to the wider and ongoing issue of big - field jump starts			0
we actively encouraged the @entity41 to embrace this approach and to grip this matter with more urgency than they have shown but to no avail			0
‘ we believe the decision to lay any charges is an opportunity lost by the @entity41			0
if the jockeys decide to contest the charges we trust that the @entity41 will allow it to be dealt with in a transparent manner and ensure the hearing is open to members of the media , even though this will inevitably lead to their officials and procedural failings being placed under the spotlight			0
” the only jockey who rode in the @entity2 not charged is @entity201 , who was on board @entity202			1
his antics in refusing to line up added to the confusion of the @entity205 found guilty the 39 are likely to face a one - day ban .			0
