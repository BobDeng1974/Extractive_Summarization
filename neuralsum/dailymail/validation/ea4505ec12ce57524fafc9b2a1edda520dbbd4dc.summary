what appeared to virtually everyone in boxing to be one of the most bitter feuds in the annals of the hard old game turned out to be a love in			2
or so @entity8 and @entity9 told us as they walked onto a famous stage here as collaborators in the big sell of the richest fight of all time			1
louder than the maestro of the ring who calls himself by that bizarre nickname			0
@entity8 speaks as @entity23 's promoter @entity9 looks on in @entity24 on wednesday @entity8 and @entity9 insist there is no lasting animosity after they went their separate ways in business @entity8 ( left ) and @entity23 meet in a long - awaited mega-fight on may 2 at the @entity31 in @entity32 more noisily than the promoter who has banged the drum for many of the biggest fights ever , from @entity37 1 all the way to @entity39 this may 2 in @entity32 ‘ animosity ? ’ said @entity9 of his relationship with @entity8 who , in his prime , walked out on him			1
’ ‘ never a problem between us , ’ said @entity8			1
but was n’t it @entity8 who always blamed @entity9 , subsequently @entity23 ’s promoter , whenever the moguls failed to make this match for which @entity51 has been clamouring for five years			1
‘ no , ’ said the no 1 pound - for - pound boxer in the world			1
‘ the only reason we broke up was because it was time for me to become my own promoter			1
‘ me and my father ( also his trainer ) and my uncles ( also his corner men when called upon ) to become the @entity64			2
‘ i needed to get that experience for when it came to giving back to the sport by helping the youngsters			2
’ @entity8 , here with @entity69 , said there was ' ‘ never a problem between us ' in relation to @entity9 ' animosity ? nah , ' said @entity9 of @entity8			1
he ( left ) is now the promoter for @entity23 ‘ blame me , ’ said @entity9			1
‘ it was a generational thing			2
@entity8 wanted me to reach out to the @entity78 - @entity77 audience			2
but that was a different cultural group from when we put on @entity37 and @entity81 and @entity82			0
‘ @entity8 saw the potential in the hip - hop community but i could not connect with them			1
so , yes , it was time for him to go off on his own			2
’ money - not the man but the $ 350 million to half a billion dollars this fight is expected to generate – is a powerful healing agent			1
these old rivals thanked each other – as well as everyone else they could think of – for bringing home this mother lode			2
the last vestiges of a dark age in which boxers were exploited and then left to rot with the after - effects of being battered about the head have been condemned to history by this deal			0
one which has coerced rival cable tv giants @entity104 and @entity106 into sharing their part of the spoils			0
one which is not so much a commercial world record breaker as out of this world			0
‘ all of boxing will be elevated by this fight , ’ says @entity9			1
@entity9 ( left ) said his split from @entity8 was a ' generational thing ' and that there 's no hard feelings remember @entity8 demanding @entity120 standard random drugs testing , a stipulation which cast aspersions as to how @entity23 had managed to keep rising through the weights to win world titles in an unprecedented – and probably unsurpassable – eight divisions ? and then @entity23 suggesting a $ 5 million penalty if either of them failed such a test ? that bet was turned down by @entity8 but @entity9 explains : ‘ it was n’t because @entity8 was any more scared about the result than @entity23			1
it was just that he and his team figured they would get a lot more if @entity23 did n’t pass the test			2
just as we knew we would get a damn sight more than $ 5million if @entity8 failed the test			2
’ they still differ on some of the fine points when it comes to claiming credit for making this mega-bucks spectacular finally happen			0
@entity8 says : ‘ the chance meeting between me and @entity23 at the basketball game and then our talk in his hotel room got all this together			1
‘ after that i rang @entity151 ( the new svengali for top boxers ) every week			0
the first time he said " not yet "			0
the second and third time , " not yet			0
" then he said " almost " and we got it done			0
’ @entity8 arrives in the arena ahead of the glitzy press conference in @entity24 on wednesday night @entity23 , a resounding underdog for the fight , gets his own rousing reception on entry for the appearance @entity9 talks of how his meeting with @entity166 television chief @entity165 broke the deadlock : ‘ he told me he could bring @entity8 to the table and i believed him			1
so when he asked if i would meet with @entity151 i said of course and we worked out the major issues in a couple of hours			0
‘ then we got together with @entity106 and @entity104 and it took only minutes for them to agree to share the broadcast			0
there will still some small details to be resolved but although they maybe took longer than they should have we got it done			0
’ the fans could n’t care less who got it done			0
the world waits with bated breath for the two best boxers on the planet to move on from this face - to - face in @entity24 to opposite corners of the ring in the @entity31			1
‘ the best against the best , ’ says @entity8			1
‘ that ’s what makes it so exciting			0
’ it has always been thus			0
only sometimes it takes money to make even the best see sense			0
like a minimum $ 180 million for @entity199 , $ 120 million for @entity23			1
a fortune so vast that it is more than @entity37 , @entity81 and @entity82 ever dreamed of .			0

@entity8 and @entity9 , now @entity23 's promoter , both said they have no problem with each other despite famously falling out
both said they split at the right time ahead of @entity8 - @entity23 fight
the mega-fight is *due* to rake in from $ 350 million to half a billion dollars
@entity9 said on wednesday : ‘ all of boxing will be elevated by this fight ’
both *dispute* who was most *influential* in bringing the fight to *fruition*
