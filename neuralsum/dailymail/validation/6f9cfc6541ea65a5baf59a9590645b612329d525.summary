as the clock ticked down on @entity4 ’s @entity3 win , goalkeeper @entity0 looked in a world of his own as he glanced around @entity7 , savouring every last moment			1
when the final whistle confirmed his first winners ’ medal since the @entity14 victory over @entity15 on penalties with @entity17 in 2006 , the goalkeeper immediately searched out the twin lights who had inspired his incredible comeback story			1
over the course of his two long years out injured , four year old daughter @entity21 and then the arrival of little @entity25 , now 22 - months old , provided both fortitude and hope in what was a seemingly endless dark tunnel for @entity0			1
@entity30 lifts the @entity31 alongside keeper @entity0 ( right ) on sunday once @entity34 ’s most expensive keeper , his girls now found their daddy a house - husband , unemployed after being released by @entity37 in the summer of 2012 due to knee tendon and anterior cruciate ligament injuries			1
neither daughter knew him as @entity0 , @entity41 hero and @entity14 - winning goalkeeper ; the man who had once been voted as having made the best save in the 20 - year history of the @entity46			1
and the longer his spell out of the game continued , the more the 32 - year - old ’s retirement looked a weary inevitability			1
keeper @entity0 gets the drinks flowing in the dressing room and sprays champagne as his team - mates on sunday , however , as @entity4 looked to the future with the first trophy of the @entity58 era , @entity0 celebrated with his family present at @entity7 , including wife @entity60			1
it was , he conceded , a day he feared may never happen			2
‘ i took a moment or two towards the end to think about things , ’ admitted @entity0 , his lips visibly quivering with emotion after the 2 - 0 win against @entity65			1
‘ when the game was already won , and @entity65 were n’t going to get back into it , it was nice to stand up the other end of the pitch and just have a look around at the fans celebrating and singing all the songs			1
@entity4 goalkeeper @entity0 poses with the @entity31 trophy in the winning changing room ‘ to win it feels brilliant , absolutely fantastic			1
it ’s the manager ’s first competition and he ’s won it — so it ’s great for him but it ’s also great for me personally			2
‘ i just wanted to take it all in , to realise that this was really happening for me			2
that i had won a cup again			2
it had been a long time coming since the last one at @entity17			2
it ’s a dream come true			0
‘ i took my two little girls , @entity21 and @entity25 , out on to the pitch with me afterwards			0
it was so nice to be able to do that for them			0
they have stood by me and they have supported me for the two whole years when i was n’t working , while i was concentrating fully on getting back into football			0
@entity4 goalkeeper @entity0 maintains his clean sheet during the @entity31 final ‘ it must have been a hard thing for them to have to deal with			1
they were so young that they never really knew what @entity107 did for a living			0
they were a big part of my inspiration to get back to top level football			0
i wanted to show them what their @entity107 used to do ! ‘ and i managed to do that			0
it means the world to me to share that moment with my girls out there on the pitch			0
and they absolutely loved it , dancing around and picking up all the confetti			0
it was such a special moment for me and for my family ; a moment i will never forget			0
” as he danced across the park with his girls and his jubilant team - mates , gone were memories of surgery and the seemingly interminable healing process			1
‘ to come from where i was , all the hard work makes it special , ’ he smiled			2
‘ at times it might have been easier to give up but the support i ’ve had to keep going , to carry on and to get to here is just brilliant			0
it feels like i am back now			0
@entity0 pumps his fists in celebration as @entity4 defeated @entity65 in the @entity31 final ‘ when i was injured , i just wanted to play a game of football again			1
but once i managed that i realised i was capable of getting back to a high level			0
and that ’ s when i started to think about what is possible			2
‘ but to do this in my first season back is just amazing			0
when i first signed for @entity4 last summer , @entity148 was still here as no 1 goalkeeper			1
‘ so to get in and have 40 games under my belt – plus a medal in the bank – is just so hard to contemplate			2
this is more than i could ever have hoped for when i was making the journey back from where i have been			0
‘ but i ca n’t afford to look too far back because we ’ve got a busy run - in to come this season			2
‘ we ’ve got a difficult game on wednesday night against @entity65 in the @entity14 quarter - final replay and this result today might give @entity65 an added incentive to come out and have an even bigger go at us			1
‘ i thought @entity65 played pretty well today even with 10 men			1
they stuck to their tasks and they are a tough team to break down			0
so if we are not at our best , 100 per cent ready , they will have every chance to do well against us			0

@entity4 beat @entity65 2 - 0 in the @entity31 final
keeper @entity0 got his first winners ’ medal since 2006
@entity0 has *recovered* from *numerous* injuries to succeed at @entity4
