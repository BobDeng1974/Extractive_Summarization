@entity1 , right , poses for photos with her son @entity23 at their home in @entity2 , @entity3 she will see her high risk insurance pool coverage dissolve by the year 's end ' i do n't know if my two cardiologists and my procedures are going to be covered under the plan			1
there just is n't enough information on that website			2

state officials throughout the nation have been scrambling to figure out how to help people like @entity1			1
last week , the board of the @entity45 — which covers about 11,000 people — ordered the state to create a contingency plan for its members because the state 's online exchange still has not enrolled a single person			1
for now , the only way to enroll for coverage in @entity55 is to fill out a 19 - page paper application			1
the state has so far received just 7,300 such applications from all @entity59 , not just those in the pool , but it has not yet processed any of them			0
@entity1 suffers from a serious heart condition and suffered a cardiac arrest in 2009 the process takes up to several weeks , so no one has completed it and successfully enrolled , @entity65 spokesman @entity64 said			2
@entity65 pool administrator @entity69 said he hopes to speed up enrollment for its members by mailing them a paper application and following up to make sure they filled it out			0
in @entity75 , the @entity74 extended the high - risk pool coverage until at least jan. 31 because of difficulties with the federal health insurance exchange			0
its pool covers about 6,800 people			0
the move was crucial , officials said , because people in the pool were not able to schedule treatments without proof of health coverage for the coming year			1
@entity75 will spend $ 6.3 million to extend the coverage			0
@entity1 and hundreds of thousands of other people with preexisting chronic conditions are covered through high risk insurance pools in @entity95 , the @entity93 that covers 24,500 people is rolling out an outreach effort to make sure their members are signed up by the deadline , chief executive @entity92 said			1
the state created a worksheet and directories of carriers to help people prepare for enrollment , has sent postcard reminders and is answering questions through its @entity109 page and weekly newsletters			0
many of those in high - risk pools across the nation will be shopping for insurance for the first time in years			0
' even if the technology was really perfect , it would still be hard to sign up because many people who are really sick do n't respond well to change , ' said @entity120 , executive director of @entity122 - based @entity121 , which connects uninsured people with care			2
' many of them are just trying to get through the day			0

hundreds of thousands of people will lose coverage by the year 's end
