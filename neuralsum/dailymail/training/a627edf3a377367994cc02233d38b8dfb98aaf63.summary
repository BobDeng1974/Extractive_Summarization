by @entity0 for @entity1 as dwelling values across the country continue to rise while rental rates struggle to keep up , @entity2 has revealed how the capital cities compare with their rental yields for both houses and units			1
the property analytics provider has predicted a continued compression in rental yields across the major cities , as the last 12 months have seen the average typical gross yield for houses fall from 4.1 per cent to 3.7 per cent			1
@entity2 reports that the only two cities where the rental yield has risen in the last year are @entity18 and @entity19 , with 5.2 per cent and 4.2 per cent recorded respectively			1
@entity27 came in third place with 4.5 per cent , while @entity29 and @entity30 had 4.1 per cent each			0
@entity31 and @entity32 , which are suffering from the greatest yield compression , recorded the lowest rental yields of 3.6 per cent and 3.2 per cent			1
' over the past year we have seen @entity31 's gross rental yields fall by 47 basis points from 4.1 per cent to 3.6 per cent , ' @entity2 research director @entity35 said			1
' in @entity32 , where rental yields are even lower , we have seen gross yields fall by 32 basis points over the year to reach 3.2 per cent gross			1
@entity18 had the second highest rental yield for houses at 5.2 per cent , and the third highest for units , also 5.2 per cent ' given the current rate of value growth and moderate rental growth , it wont be long before @entity31 yields have moved below @entity32			1
' with yields so low in the cities where values are seeing the largest capital gains , it is clear that investors remain very much focussed on value growth rather than yields			0
' @entity21 also recorded the highest rental yield for units at 5.8 per cent , followed closely by @entity27 with 5.4 per cent			1
@entity31 and @entity32 were again at the bottom of the list , recording 4.5 per cent and 4.2 per cent			2
this comes as the figures also showed house prices in @entity67 capital cities recorded their strongest gains in winter since 2007 , increasing by 4.2 percent in the three months to the end of august			2
the lift in capital gains was driven by @entity32 which recorded a 6.4 percent increase , beating @entity31 which recorded a 5 percent increase			2
@entity32 and @entity31 were the only capital cities to record double - digit dwelling value growth over the past year			0
@entity32 outperformed @entity31 over winter but @entity31 was the leader year - on - year , with house prices increasing 16.2 percent in @entity31 compared with 11.7 percent in @entity32			0

the best suburbs for capital growth in each capital city , the median house price , and average capital growth over the past 10 years @entity2 research director @entity35 said @entity31 and @entity32 housing markets were driving these two tier conditions			2
he added that he expected dwelling values to increase again this @entity88			0
' considering the ongoing high rate of auction clearance rates , a generally rapid rate of sale and the ongoing low interest rate environment , it 's likely that dwelling values rise even further over the next three months , ' mr @entity35 said			0
' consumer confidence is also moving in the right direction now after the post-budget slump which will add fuel to the exuberant buying and selling conditions we have seen during winter			0
