from blocked drains to burnt toast , there are some smells that most of us would love to block out			2
now scientists think there may be a way of stopping people smelling unpleasant aromas by creating a blend of chemical compounds that neuralise a specific pungent aroma			1
they have devised a mathematical model that predicts how humans perceive certain smells and think they could be blocked by creating what they describe as ' white noise for the nose '			1
scientists think there may be a way of stopping people smelling unpleasant aromas ( illustrated with a stock image ) by creating a blend of 38 aromas to create ' white smell ' while visual and audio signals are easily manipulated , because waves can be described mathematically , it is harder to use equations to describe the chemistry behind smells , @entity26 reported			1
but @entity33 of @entity35 ’s @entity34 in @entity36 and @entity37 of the @entity38 at @entity38 have managed to describe different smells using maths			1
the brothers have come up with a mathematical model that predicts how humans perceive the smells of certain substances based on their chemistry and physical properties			2
the duo did this by matching a database of chemical compounds to perceived smells , so that a compound could smell 5.8 chalky , on a scale of -5 to 10			1
two brothers have devised a mathematical model that predicts how humans perceive certain smells			2
their research could one day lead to the creation of a smell - cancelling device , which could be used to block out a range of nasty smells from burnt toast ( illustrated left ) to nasty bodily whiffs ( stock image right ) a @entity70 study recently uncovered the process behind how the brain makes smells stick to distant memories and ' inner maps '			1
researchers designed a maze for rats , where a rat would see a hole to poke its nose into			0
when poking into the hole , the rat was presented with one of two alternative smells			0
one smell told the rat that food is in the left food cup behind the rat			0
the other smell told it there was food in the right cup			0
after three weeks , the rats chose the hole with the food more than 85 per cent of the time			0
electrode pairs were inserted in the brains of the rats throughout			0
after the associations between smell and place were established , the researchers could see a pattern of brain wave activity in these areas			0
they say that a smell can be cancelled out by calculating which compounds create the opposite ratings , so that a perfectly neutral score of 0 is achieved			1
@entity114 , of the @entity115 in @entity116 , @entity113 came up with the idea of ‘ white smell ’ – a specific blend of 30 compounds that can be compared to white noise for the nose			1
now , the @entity37 brothers have shown that a blend of 38 compounds can cancel pungent smells such as onion and tuna			2
while a smell cancelling machine has not yet been created , the pair think that their mathematical model could make it possible			2
they came up with the idea having been inspired by @entity35 ’s experimental @entity136 computer , which is currently learning to cook by looking at which flavour compounds different foods have in common			0
dr @entity114 , who is working on his own smell - cancelling device , said that white smell itself is not very palatable			1
‘ it 's not very pleasant , but it 's not foul			0
it 's not very edible smelling , but it does n't smell poisonous , ’ he said .			0

brothers at @entity35 in @entity36 and the @entity38 at @entity38 have described different smells using mathematics
they matched chemical compounds to perceived smells and gave them a rating do that an opposite compound can be added to make a neutral smell
neutral smell is known as ' white smell ' - the aural equivalent of white noise
model could be used to build a smell - cancelling device to block *bad* odours
