ever since those two ' c 's first interlinked in the 1920s , @entity2 has been one of the most lusted - after brands on the planet			1
its iconic pieces - the little black dress , the tailored suit and the luxe quilted bag to name but a few - have been worn with pride by the fashion elite and copied by designers worldwide for the best part of a century			1
from the catwalk to market stalls , fashion is infused with @entity2 influence			0
who has n't been offered a plastic channel bag on a street corner or bought an ' lbd ' inspired by @entity2 's original ' ? but this season the uber brand flipped the @entity2 copycat trend on its head			2
their current jewellery collection includes a rather more expensive copy of another iconic design - the sweetie necklace			1
and despite the eye - watering price tag , the designer version is n't even edible - or at best is extremely hard and very bland			1
of course , as with any @entity2 design , the fashionable set have latched onto the trend and have been wearing this new souped - up version of the sweetie necklace with pride			1
@entity53 , back in town recently for @entity55 , looked her usual stylish - self sporting the candy chain with a pair of dress - down dungarees			1
and @entity2 are having no trouble shifting the pricey pastel goods from their stores , along with the matching £ 975 cuff			1
the designs have also been praised by fashion magazines and bloggers alike for their innovation			0
but perhaps there 's a touch of ' @entity69 ' about this latest trend			0
is n't a £ 754.80 mark up on a 20p item , well , to put it mildly , totally and utterly and absurdly bonkers ? left : fashionista @entity53 wears the @entity2 necklace ; right : the edible version is a favourite amongst the under - ten set the matching £ 975 cuff : the famous interlocked ' c 's are created out of plastic sweetie - like beads ' it seems bonkers but it ’s fitting with the general fashion movement , ' says @entity89 style editor @entity88			1
' @entity90 did the @entity92 fast food collection , and @entity93 did bags in the form of cereal and kitchen essentials ( the @entity99 and @entity100 clutch and @entity101 and @entity103 bags )			0
fashion seems to have embraced the kitsch idea of nostalgic food and items			0
' even though @entity2 is known for being a traditional brand they have been mixing it up with their urban rucksack and trainers on the catwalk , so it ’s not completely out of the blue			0
it ’s a tongue in cheek take on the traditional string of pearls ' this general trend has filtered onto the high street already with @entity119 creating a burger clutch bag and @entity123 selling a bagel phone case			0
so , perhaps you may see the 20p version popping up on fashion bloggers soon , ' suggests @entity88			2
six - year - old @entity128 , who recently bought the classic version of the candy necklace with her tooth fairy money , is also in favour of the upgraded designer version			2
when shown a picture of the @entity2 piece she was enamored by the subtle glitzy detail			0
the six - year - old , whose fashion favourites include @entity140 necklaces and diamond stick - on earrings , asked : ' can i have that one instead ? i like the sparkly bits			2
' but when asked if she would pay £ 755 pounds for the added sparkle , 3,775 times more than she shelled out on her own one at the sweet shop , she found herself in a financial dilemma			1
' i do n't have that many teeth and four of mine have already fallen out already so i do n't think i will have enough money , ' she said			0
' but maybe i can get one for my birthday ? ' she did have one important question , however : ' what do the sparkly bits taste like ? '			0

the necklace is 3,775 times more expensive than the original edible version
despite eye - watering price tag it 's already popular with fashion elite
@entity53 sported the design at @entity55
the necklace also comes with matching £ 975 cuff
