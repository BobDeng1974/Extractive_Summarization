former @entity1 captain @entity0 says he does not think @entity1 will win the @entity2 this year			1
@entity0 , who won 71 caps over a 10 - year career , believes @entity6 's team are ' not quite where they need to be ' to lift the @entity9 cup on october 31			2
the former @entity14 and @entity15 flanker , speaking at an awards ceremony for the @entity11 in @entity12 , told the @entity16 : ' i do n't think @entity1 are in the right place at the moment to win the @entity2			1
former @entity1 captain @entity0 does not think @entity1 are in a position to win the @entity2 @entity0 knows what it takes to win the tournament having lifted the @entity24 in 2003 ' if they can get through the pool stages they 'll have a great , fighting chance			1
being at home for every match makes a massive difference and if you get into a semi-final anything could happen - but i think at the minute they are probably not quite where they need to be to win the @entity2			2
' they can certainly be there to push the others , and if they get into the semi-final then there is every chance they could make the final			0
' @entity0 , who can not see beyond @entity44 as tournament winners , believes @entity46 may be hoping his squad will peak for 2019			1
he continued : ' he 's been building a team , there are a lot of young new changes coming , so i think he 'll be focusing on the next @entity2 , especially as he 's had that nice new contract extension			0
' however , he believes @entity1 can still win the @entity53			1
lancaster oversee training as his side prepare to face @entity56 in the @entity53 on saturday how @entity1 and @entity56 will line up for saturday 's @entity58 clash at @entity59 @entity0 said : ' it is disappointing that @entity1 have ended up in this position			1
they had a good chance to come away with a @entity64 but they have got to focus on @entity56 now			2
' it should be a reasonably comfortable result against @entity56 , and then go on and beat @entity67			1
they can still win it , but it will be a big ask now - we are reliant on other teams			2
' @entity0 added : ' i am a huge fan of @entity6			2
' i think he 's done terribly well and i think all that now @entity6 is lacking is that win , that result that really says , ' look , what i 've been doing over the last four years has been about this , achieving this ' , and if we can take something out of the @entity53 , which will be tough now , then he 'll have that			1
' one bonus is that the @entity53 may well have ironed out @entity1 's conundrum at fly - half and in the centres , @entity0 suggested , with @entity86 and @entity87 cementing their places			1
he said : ' for me it is quite simple			0
i think @entity90 has stepped up and done a fantastic job			0
i 'd keep him there , and he would be my man for the @entity2			0
it will be interesting to see where @entity96 ( @entity95 ) slots in when he comes back			0
@entity0 thinks @entity86 has stepped up as @entity1 centre and should keep his place for the @entity2 @entity90 offloads a pass during training as @entity1 prepare for saturday 's @entity53 match against @entity56 ' @entity87 has stepped in and filled a void i think we 've been nursing since @entity104 was playing , and that 's some time ago now			1
' and when @entity106 comes back i 'd like to see @entity87 and @entity106 playing in the centres together and how they can work that			0
i think ( @entity110 ) @entity109 has been all right but i think @entity87 and @entity106 are probably the future			0
' @entity0 was adamant @entity90 's rise had not consigned @entity95 's days as @entity1 's starting number 10 to history			1
' they are certainly not over , ' he said			0
' the fact @entity117 has come in and done so well , @entity86 has had a fantastic start to his international career			0
' @entity96 is a young man in his own right			0
those two vied for the under 20s spots , they were centre and fly - half together when they played @entity1 under 20s together , so they know each other well			2
' @entity96 is a great temperament and he 'll work hard to make sure he is pushing @entity117 all the way for that 10 shirt			0

the @entity131 starts in *september* and will be held in @entity1
@entity0 does not believe hosts are in a position to win tournament
former captain @entity0 does believe @entity1 can win the @entity53
@entity1 play @entity56 at @entity59 on saturday for the @entity58
@entity0 backs @entity1 to secure a comfortable *victory* against the @entity140
