a tiny @entity1 garage on a millionaire ’s row has gone on the market for a whopping £ 80,000			2
the lock - up in @entity6 on a road with an average house price of £ 900,000 has been described as a ‘ @entity1 detached ’ in an ‘ outstanding location just to the north of the river ’			1
the current owners are hoping the bubbling housing market and competition for property in the university city on @entity17 will bag them a generous £ 80,000			0
but changes to planning laws could mean permission may be granted by the council in the future			1
@entity39 , head of residential with @entity41 estate agents , said : ‘ the price reflects the fact that in @entity6 it very difficult to find off street parking in the more urban areas			1
‘ and if someone owns a house in a street where house prices are up to a million pounds then they will want off street parking to go with the property , because that ’s what buyers want			0
‘ it may not have planning permission to be a dwelling now but 10 years down the line it may and then £ 80,000 will look cheap			1
@entity6 is reflecting what is happening in @entity61 where garages are going for £ 300,000 to £ 400,000			1
’ the priciest recent sale on the road was £ 1,245,000 for a five - bedroom semi-detached house in august 2013			0
that is also the road 's most expensive home by current value , according to @entity70			0
from above : a planning application to turn the garage into a home was refused by the council in 2004 expensive : the average house price on @entity17 in the university city is £ 900,000 @entity6 house prices have soared by 20 per cent with property website @entity78 estimating the cost of an average home in the city as £ 419,000			1
it has also become the fastest selling city in @entity85			0
the @entity87 house price index , published in april , found average @entity6 prices are higher than those in @entity61 - £ 406,040 to £ 401,000			2
' if someone owns a house in a street where house prices are up to a million pounds then they will want off street parking to go with the property , because that ’s what buyers want ' @entity39 , @entity41 estate agents @entity100 , of estate agents @entity101 & @entity102 , which is representing the owner of the garage , said : ‘ it was refused planning permission 10 years ago to be a dwelling but it may be easier now			1
but it could be an office studio or a place to park some very nice cars			0
' i do n’t think this is really a reflection on house prices in @entity6 or parking			2
it is an unusual property			0
it also has an inspection pit so it may be for someone who likes to fix up cars or turn it into a business			0
’ a new record was set in april for the most expensive garage in @entity85 , after a 568ft former coach house in @entity126 , south @entity61 , was sold for £ 550,000 - triple the asking price .			2
