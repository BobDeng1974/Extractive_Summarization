as romantic comedy @entity2 celebrates its 25 - year anniversary this week , the film 's scriptwriter has revealed that the iconic fairy - tale ending could have been very different			1
the 1990 film , which is set in @entity6 , sees @entity7 as @entity8 , a down - on - her - luck prostitute who agrees to become a one - week escort for wealthy businessman , @entity11 , played by @entity12			1
the much - loved movie ends with the improbable pair going off in the sunset together - yet the original ending was more realistic and was intended to reflect his story 's ' dark and gritty ' tone			1
in the original script , @entity11 is seen to patrol around intentionally looking for a prostitute @entity30 screenwriter @entity29 , who penned the original script , which was called $ 3000 for the amount @entity11 agrees to pay @entity8 for a week of her company , revealed in an interview with @entity34 that : ' the tone and ending are completely different			1
' most notably , in @entity29 's original script @entity8 and @entity11 do not find true love together			1
indeed , @entity2 's @entity40 ending that sees @entity11 as a modern - day knight in shining armour , who ' rescues ' @entity8 from her apartment block would have been completely different			1
instead , @entity29 says : ' the film ends with @entity47 [ @entity8 's prostitute friend ] and @entity8 on a bus bound for @entity50 ... with kit anticipating a fun day financed by @entity8 's week with @entity11 , as @entity8 ' stares out emptily ahead			1
'' this dismal ending was just one of the many changes that happened			2
@entity29 's script also portrayed @entity8 as a drug addict and the six pages include focus on her locking down a deal to buy crack cocaine			2
the original script dictates that @entity2 ends with @entity61 on a bus bound for @entity50 as @entity8 ' stares out emptily ahead '			1
there is no ' knight in shining armour ' scene for @entity8 ( pictured ) in the original script , @entity8 is a helpless drug addict that must use prostitution to fund her crack addiction upon clocking the original script , even @entity7 described it as , ' a really dark and depressing , horrible , terrible story about two horrible people			1
she said : ' my character was this drug addict , a bad - tempered , foulmouthed , ill - humored , poorly educated hooker who had this weeklong experience with a foulmouthed , ill - tempered , bad - humored , very wealthy , handsome but horrible man and it was just a grisly , ugly story about these two people			2
' the lead characters ' adorable meeting on @entity25 is no romantic affair either			0
the film 's version portrays @entity11 comically and clumsily unable to drive his borrowed sports ' car and stopping to ask for directions from a chirpy @entity8 , who thinks he 's a potential customer			2
in the original script , @entity11 is very much looking for a prostitute when he stumbles upon @entity8 @entity2 stars reunited on @entity88 show this morning , left to right : @entity90 , @entity91 , director @entity89 , presenter @entity92 , @entity7 and @entity12 pretty woman ! the original scriptwriter has admitted that the ending could never have stayed the same ' dark and gritty ' way once the film was cast , as @entity12 and @entity7 ' just light up with each other ' the iconic shopping scene where @entity8 is given @entity11 's card and goes on a limitless shopping spree never happens in the original script in the film , @entity12 's character @entity11 is constantly looking out for @entity8 and even enlists the help of shop assistants to help her with her new wardrobe			1
in the original script he never tries to protect @entity7 's character @entity8			1
he instead cruelly offers her up to his friend as if she were just a possession and magical shopping scene , with the soundtrack of @entity113 's catchy pretty woman ? it never happens			2
the moment where @entity11 defends @entity8 's honour by hitting his sleazy friend @entity117 - who assaults her in @entity11 's hotel suite - is also a missing component in the original script			2
instead @entity11 demeans @entity8 and offers her up to his friend as if she were a possession : ' you want her ? i do n't mind			0
you want to try her ? ' while the last words that the couple ever say to each other in the first script are definitely more than a little depressing			0
rather than defend her from his sleazy friend , the script sees @entity11 offer @entity8 up like a piece of meat the movie version sees @entity8 having the confidence to gun for a relationship with the businessman before taking off to start a new life off the streets			2
inspired by her , he jumps into his white limo to declare his undying love , asking , ' so what happens after he climbs up and rescues her ? she replies : ' she rescues him right back			0
' they then kiss passionately on the fire escape as the credits roll			0
in the unrevised story , @entity11 is supposed to drag @entity8 from his car , callously throwing her on the ground , where he first picked her up on @entity25			0
he throws money at her and heartlessly gets back in the car , saying : ' you 'll regret it tomorrow if you do n't take it			0
you 'll regret it the minute i drive away			0
' @entity8 responds by screaming at him : ' go to hell ! i hate you ! i hate your money ! i hate it ! ' in the unrevised script , @entity12 never ' rescues ' @entity7 with roses up her apartment ladder , but instead throws her heartlessly from his car and chucks money at her the original script show the heated and horrid final exchange between the two characters , who clearly never end up together @entity29 's script became hot property after it was pitched to @entity172 's production company , @entity171			1
but after it was given a large budget and big name director @entity89 it was largely rewritten as a rom - com			2
@entity29 suspects this rewrite was partially down to the casting of the leads @entity7 and @entity12			1
' they had auditioned @entity181 , they had auditioned @entity183 , and it would definitely have been a different movie if had it been @entity181 and @entity183 , ' he said			0
@entity7 described her original character as ' this drug addict , a bad - tempered , foulmouthed , ill - humored , poorly educated hooker , ' rather than the lovable and talkative @entity8 in @entity2 the @entity2 cast reminisced about making the movie 25 years after it came out on @entity88 's @entity189 @entity7 and @entity12 have a laugh as they remember filming the 1992 blockbuster rom com ' it might have been closer to the original script and maybe not have had a happy ending			1
' but the chemistry between @entity7 and @entity12 , it is palpable on the screen , it was palpable in auditions			1
' you ca n't really see how it could end any other way , because they just light up with each other , ' the screenwriter admits			0
@entity89 agreed , and has also revealed that he had a set vision for what he wanted his fairytale rewrite to capture			0
@entity89 admitted : '' my vision was a combination of fairy tales			0
@entity7 [ @entity214 ] was @entity215 , @entity12 [ @entity12 ] was @entity216 and @entity90 [ @entity217 - who plays the kind hotel manager ] was the fairy godmother			1
' even before the rewrite , @entity89 described the film as a story about ' a girl who wanted to change her life , and did '			0
@entity226 : at the end of the film , instead of the elderly modern - day rose dropping the iconic ' @entity232 ' necklace into the sea without a word to anyone , she stands with the treasure hunter and launches into a cheesy speech about life being the only priceless thing			2
then she drops the necklace into the sea			0
@entity242 : instead of the film ending mid-air during @entity242 ' death dive off the cliff - which gives connotations of freedom and spirit - the car is seen violently tumbling down the mountain in a deathly fiery blaze			2
@entity253 : rather than the tame ending where the couple kiss and then celebrate with their friends , an alternate ending sees @entity259 carrying @entity261 's lifeless body into the party			1
he is about to announce her sudden death , when they both reveal it 's a tasteless joke ... only then do they live happily ever after			0
rocky balboa : in the film , @entity268 ( @entity269 ) is defeated in his comeback fight by his younger and fitter opponent ( a realistic offering )			0
whereas @entity268 is victorious in the alternate ending			0
dodgeball : a true underdog story : the @entity277 's team wins in the actual film , but an alternate ending sees them lose			1
this was changed after test audiences reacted badly to this first unhappy ending			0
at the end of the actual film , @entity283 references this by saying ' you happy now ? '			0
