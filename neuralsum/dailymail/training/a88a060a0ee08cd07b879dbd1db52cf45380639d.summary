by @entity1 reporter published : 20:47 est , 20 september 2013 updated : 09:39 est , 21 september 2013 when most people think of @entity4 , they think of a rough - riding , bear - wrestling frontiersman who tamed the @entity6 and who once was shot in the chest at point - blank range but could n't be bothered with going to the hospital			1
while many of the legends about the 26th president of the @entity15 are genuine , one of the more iconic pieces of @entity18 imagery , it turns out , is a fraud			0
one of the more - famous photos of the leader of the original @entity22 shows him riding a moose across a body of water			2
but , as a curator at a @entity29 has discovered , the image was the product of nothing more than a very basic form of @entity33			0
bull moose ? more like bull - crap ! iconic photo of @entity4 turns out to be fake safari : just because he did n't ride a moose does n't mean @entity4 was n't a skilled outdoorsman @entity40 : after leaving the presidency , @entity4 created the @entity40 and ran for president again as the @entity40 candidate @entity44 , curator of the university 's @entity4 book collection , has discovered that the photo was simply doctored to make @entity4 appear as though he was riding a bull moose as part of a newspaper 's coverage of the 1912 presidential election , in which @entity4 was running as a candidate from the newly formed @entity55 ' @entity54			1
the photo was created by the photography firm @entity57 and used in a collage titled @entity59 for the @entity60			0
' the collage was published in the @entity62 on september 8 , 1912			0
without the back - story of the whole collage , the photo of @entity4 has been repeatedly taken out of context when viewed by itself as a candid photo of president @entity4			1
but as part of the bigger picture of the collage as a whole , a photographer altering the image to include a moose makes much more sense			0
statesman : when he was n't riding horses , @entity4 was the first president to fly in a plane and drive a car the other two men in the original collage were president @entity83 riding an elephant and @entity85 saddled up on the back of a donkey			1
@entity83 was running as a @entity88 , while @entity85 was running as a @entity89			1
the symbolic animals for those parties are an elephant and a donkey , respectively			0
so , as the founding father of the @entity40 , it only made sense to put @entity4 on the back of a giant moose			1
over the years , as photos emerged of @entity4 wrangling horses and killing rhinoceroses , it did n't seem too far - fetched that he could woo a moose into giving him a lift across a river			0
rough rider : @entity4 made a name for himself leading the @entity22 in the @entity108 @entity109 theorizes that @entity110 used a photo of @entity4 riding a horse and then carefully taped it over a photo of the moose to make it appear as though he was riding it			2
also visible , as @entity109 points out , is the white line scratched or painted on the photo to approximate a ripple made by @entity4 's leg in the water .			2

the original photo was part of a collage during the 1912 presidential campaign
at the time , @entity4 was running as a candidate from the newly formed @entity40
his *opponents* - a @entity88 and a @entity89 - appeared in the same collage riding their respective party 's *mascot*
