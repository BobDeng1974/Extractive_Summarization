the launch of the @entity1 are just days away , and a lot of the talk about the new devices are their larger , ion - strengthened glass screens			1
now the @entity7 has created a video that explains why this type of screen is typically stronger than other displays - and it involves using a hot bath of potassium			1
the video also reveals many of the other elements found in smartphones , including gold , silver , tin , and even arsenic			1
the chemist has also revealed other elements found in phones such as silver , gold , tin , aluminium and silicon in the build up to @entity35 ’s @entity1 event , nearly every report claimed the devices would have a sapphire screen			1
instead , @entity35 unveiled 4.7 - inch and 5.5 - inch handsets that both feature ion - strengthened glass , during last week 's launch			1
to make ion - strengthened glass , glass is placed into a hot bath of potassium salt , typically potassium nitrate , at around 300 ° @entity47 )			1
this causes the sodium ions in the glass to migrate , which in turn causes sodium ions in the glass surface to be replaced by potassium ions from the bath solution			2
the larger potassium ions in the bath squeeze themselves into the holes created by the moving sodium			2
this compresses the glass , to accommodate the larger ions , which in turn makes it stronger			0
by comparison , sapphire screens are made from synthetic sapphire - a hard , transparent material made of crystallising aluminium oxide , produced at high temperatures			0
as the material is heated , it forms disks that can be sliced using diamond - coated saws			0
these round disks are ground into shape , and polished , to become glass			0
according to the @entity7 ’s video , created with help from experts at the @entity83 blog , ion - strengthened glass is created using a potassium bath			1
one method is to dip the glass into a hot bath of potassium salt , typically potassium nitrate , at around 300 ° @entity47 )			2
this causes the sodium ions in the glass to migrate , which in turn causes sodium ions in the glass surface to be replaced by potassium ions from the bath solution			2
the larger potassium ions in the bath squeeze themselves into the holes created by the moving sodium			0
this compresses the glass , to accommodate the larger ions , which in turn makes it stronger			0
when broken , chemically strengthened glass still shatters , similar to traditional glass , but it is said to be between six and eight times stronger			2
an alternative method for strengthening glass , is submerging the glass into a sodium nitrate bath first			0
this enriches the surface with more sodium ions , and when the ions in the glass are immersed in potassium nitrate , there are more sodium ions to be replaced , which increases the compression and strength			0
by comparison , sapphire screens are made from synthetic sapphire - a hard , transparent material made of crystallising aluminium oxide , produced at high temperatures			0
to make ion - strengthened glass , glass is placed into a hot bath of potassium salt , typically potassium nitrate , which is around @entity133 ( 572 ° f )			1
this heat causes the sodium ions in the glass to migrate , which in turn causes sodium ions in the glass surface to be replaced by potassium ions from the bath solution ( illustrated ) by comparison , the @entity143 ( pictured ) features a sapphire crystal screen as the material is heated , it forms disks that can be sliced using diamond - coated saws			1
these round disks are ground into shape , and polished , to become glass			0
the technology is traditionally used in watch displays because it is thin , super-strong and scratch resistant			0
@entity35 already uses sapphire crystal in the @entity158 fingerprint scanner on its latest @entity159 and to protects the phone 's camera			0
elsewhere , the screen on typical smartphones are also made up of extremely rare elements called praseodymium , gadolinium and terbium			1
and to achieve the charge needed to power the touchscreen , a compound of indium , tin and oxygen is used in a transparent film that conducts electricity			0
the video also explains that a typical smartphone contains about 300 milligrams of silver and 30 milligrams of gold , housed in an aluminium case			2
copper is used in the wiring and circuitry , and the silicon chips that power the devices also feature oxygen , antimony , phosphorous , gallium and arsenic			1
. ‘ so there you have it			0
those are the elements that make up the phone , you ca n’t put down , ' concluded the @entity7			2

the screen on the @entity222 contains ion - strengthened glass
this is created by placing glass into a hot potassium bath
experts from the @entity7 have also revealed other elements found in phones
a typical phone contains silver , gold , tin , aluminium and silicon
it also contains extremely rare elements such as gadolinium and terbium
the silicon chips even contains small traces of arsenic
