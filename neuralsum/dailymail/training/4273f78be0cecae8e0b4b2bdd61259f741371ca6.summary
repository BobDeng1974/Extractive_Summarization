one of the major arguments of those who deny climate change is that , over the last 15 years , global warming has been slowing down			0
@entity4 , now claims , has shown that this is consistent with models of climate change and can be explained by the weather phenomenons @entity7 and @entity8			1
by reviewing data from 1950 to 2013 scientists found models under and overestimated warming trends when @entity7 and @entity8 respectively were taken into account			1
a study claims temperature changes in the @entity16 can help explain over and underestimates in climate models			1
the study shows these trends are consistent with @entity7 and @entity8			1
shown is an anomaly image from 2007 , during @entity8 , where strong bands of blue ( cool ) water and red ( warm ) water are shown the study in @entity26 shows that @entity7 and @entity8 could explain discrepancies in climate models			1
@entity7 and @entity8 are opposite phases of what is known as the @entity7 / @entity7 ( @entity7 ) cycle , says the @entity32			2
the @entity7 cycle is a scientific term that describes the fluctuations in temperature between the ocean and atmosphere in the east - central @entity16 ( approximately between the @entity39 and 120 degrees @entity40 )			2
@entity8 is sometimes referred to as the cold phase of @entity7 and @entity7 as the warm phase			2
these deviations from normal surface temperatures can have large - scale impacts not only on ocean processes , but also on global weather and climate			0
@entity7 and @entity8 episodes typically last nine to 12 months , but some prolonged events may last for years			2
they often begin to form between june and august , reach peak strength between december and april , and then decay between may and july of the following year			0
while their periodicity can be quite irregular , @entity7 and @entity8 events occur about every three to five years			0
typically , @entity7 occurs more frequently than @entity8			0
the global warming slowdown over the last 15 years had raised questions about the accuracy and credibility of climate models			2
but now experts say that the models are accurate when natural weather systems are considered			0
the paper was led by climatologist dr @entity63 , based in @entity64			0
@entity65 and colleagues investigated the ability of present models to reproduce temperature observations for the past 15 - year period			0
over time weather patterns like @entity7 and @entity8 cancel each other out , but in the short term they can skew climate data and make models seem inaccurate			1
the findings of the research were that periods of global warming increasing or decreasing were consistent with temperature changes caused by @entity7 and @entity8			1
the authors studied a collection of 18 global climate models that are able to represent @entity7 / @entity7 ( @entity84 ) through sea surface temperatures			2
of these they identify a subset which accurately represent the current state of @entity7 / @entity7 through comparison with observations			0
by reviewing data from 1950 to 2013 scientists found models under and overestimated warming trends when @entity7 and @entity8 respectively were taken into account			1
shown is @entity95 in @entity96 , a dry lakebed flooded by @entity7 storms			0
the storms restarted the growth of polygonal salt formations over time weather patterns like @entity7 ( red ) and @entity8 ( blue ) cancel each other out , but in the short term they can skew climate data			1
the findings of the research were that periods of global warming increasing or decreasing were consistent with temperature changes caused by @entity7 and @entity8 the selected models are able to provide more accurate estimations of temperature trends over the past 15 years as well as the recent spatial trends in @entity114 surface temperature			1
‘ the question of how climate model projections have tracked the actual evolution of global mean surface air temperature is important in establishing the credibility of their projections , ’ the researchers write			0
‘ some studies and the @entity124 suggest that the recent 15 - year period ( 1998 – 2012 ) provides evidence that models are overestimating current temperature evolution			0
‘ such comparisons are not evidence against model trends because they represent only one realisation where the decadal natural variability component of the model climate is generally not in phase with observations			0
’ the scientists go on to say that climate models have actually been successful in estimating @entity16 trend patterns with regards to @entity7 and @entity8 with surprising accuracy , albeit by accident			1
the research shows how the climate in the short term can be affected by weather patterns like @entity7 and @entity8 , but it does not disprove man - made climate change is occurring			1
the predictions of weather patterns by climate models is n’t perfect , as on occasion it has been a few years out , but nonetheless the anomalies in the models seem not to have been explained .			2

study claims temp changes in the @entity16 can help explain climate models
experts were *confused* as to why warming was over or underestimated
but a new study shows these trends are consistent with @entity7 and @entity8
data from 1950 to 2013 showed *correlation* between models and weather
and the models could even be used to estimate the *occurrence* of @entity7
