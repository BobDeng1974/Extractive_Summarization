an adorable dog who was facing her tenth festive season in a dog shelter has finally found a home - just in time for @entity5			1
@entity6 , the corgi - collie cross , has been unable to find a home for almost a decade , but after her fate hit the headlines last week the shelter was overwhelmed with calls			1
and in her very own @entity5 miracle she is now settled with a new family with a cosy place in front of the fire			2
but when dog - lovers @entity34 and @entity36 saw her smiling face and read her heart - wrenching story they knew they had to meet her			1
@entity41 , 70 , said : ' we knew as soon as we saw her that we wanted to bring her home with us			0
' we 've had our little @entity45 for seven years , and my husband did say ' no more dogs '			2
but when we both saw her little face we said ' oh we will have her '			0
' the couple made the two hour journey from their home in @entity56 , @entity57 , on saturday to the kennels to see if @entity6 was the dog for them where they took her for a walk and got to know her			1
when they returned on sunday a senior dog handler assessed the couple and decided they were the perfect fit			0
@entity34 said : ' after we heard that she had been in the shelter for nine years i called them straight away to see if we could meet her			1
it just snowballed from there			0
staff at @entity74 , @entity30 , including @entity75 the kennel assistant pictured here , were overwhelmed with responses after they appealed for a new owner for @entity6 last week ' we went to the shelter in @entity30 on both days over the weekend to see if she liked us but we would have gone back again and again if that 's what it took			1
' we used to have a @entity86 , who was also called @entity6 , but she died about five months ago so i 'm glad that @entity45 has got a new friend			2
' my husband @entity89 , 65 , and i were both in the @entity91 for 22 years and it was n't fair to have a dog who would need to be quarantined every time we moved abroad so now it 's lovely to have a pet at home			1
new owner @entity34 , 70 , said : ' we knew as soon as we saw her that we wanted to bring her home with us			2
' ' @entity6 is quiet but a real charmer and her and @entity45 seem to be getting on well			1
' she has already find a little place she likes to sit under the stairs and is getting used to cosying up in front of the fire place			0
' we feel very lucky to have welcomed her into our family - she 's a little @entity5 miracle			2
' kennel supervisor @entity106 said : ' we were all sad to say goodbye to @entity6 after so many years - i was in tears - but it 's the best thing for her			1
' the morning she was in the paper the phone never stopped ringing - people were desperate to come and meet her			0
' but her new owners are a perfect fit and all being well , she 'll have a loving family for the rest of her life			0
' i ca n't believe she 's got a home in time for @entity5 - it 's the best present			2
' although @entity6 has gone to a good home , the team are still looking for homes for more than 70 dogs			1
and this comes as another dog charity appeals for owners , as their kennels are filled to capacity			2
the @entity129 is facing a ' bottleneck ' in its waiting list this festive period , with all of its kennels full to the brim			1
the unique charity is at capacity in terms of housing abandoned collies and has to operate a ' one out , one in ' system			0
the @entity129 is facing a ' bottleneck ' in its waiting list this festive period , with all of its kennels full to the brim @entity144 , a trustee of the @entity146 - based charity pictured here with eight - year - old @entity148 , said : ' it 's a bit like a conveyor belt - as one goes out there are five waiting to come in earlier this year a survey rating the attributes of each dog breed according to cost , intelligence , health , lifespan and ease of grooming placed the bordie collie in the number one spot			1
@entity144 , a trustee of the @entity146 - based charity , said : ' it 's a bit like a conveyor belt - as one goes out there are five waiting to come @entity167 have 35 dogs at the moment and we usually have a waiting list , but it is very difficult to judge an average waiting list time because the situation changes every day			1
earlier this year a survey rating the attributes of each dog breed according to cost , intelligence , health , lifespan and ease of grooming placed the bordie collie in the number one spot ' we take as much care of them as we can ' said @entity144 ' but such a loving and intelligent animal would be much better off in a home enviroment ' border collies were developed in the @entity191 border region for herding livestock and are known for their unlimited energy and stamina			0
the centre , founded in the @entity196 by @entity197 , has 11 staff who look after the dogs , taking them for walks and making sure they do n't become distressed being in kennels			0
@entity144 added : ' there are 47 kennels but we do n't like to have them all full because it would prevent us taking in emergency cases and it 's too much for the dogs to cope with			2
the problem is something we see all year round			0
the phrase ' a dog is for life not just for @entity5 ' is a very apt one and i think it 's maybe still true but in my 17 years ' experience of rescuing it happens all year round			1
the @entity129 , based in @entity219 in @entity146 , takes collies of all ages who 's owner circumstances mean they can no longer care for their pets , they also have puppies from farm litters where the farmer has no use for them ' people take on dogs and then decide , for whatever reason , they ca n't keep the dog			1
the difficulty at this time of year is historically rehoming goes quieter			0
people are thinking more about @entity5 than adopting a dog so we tend to get this bit of a bottleneck			1
' when people see these surveys saying they 're the most intelligent or the best breed they want them as a pet , but dogs are more than a pet , they are a companion and you ca n't just tell them to sit in the corner for eight hours because you 're busy			0
' but collies are a fantastic breed			0
we need to try to break that stigma about rescue dogs , they do n't all have problems			0
you just need to know what you 're taking on			0

@entity260 cross @entity6 had been at @entity261 in @entity30 since she was two - years - old
