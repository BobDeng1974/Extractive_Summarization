by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:11 est , 10 october 2012 updated : 10:37 est , 10 october 2012 @entity2 will address an audience of 2,200 at the party conference today , but he has spent the week building a much bigger crowd online			1
the prime minister ignored his own advice about the perils of @entity10 and signed up to the micro-blogging site on saturday night , promising more ' edgy ' political output			1
four days later @ @entity13 has attracted more than 100,000 followers , been bombarded with abuse and posted the obligatory photo of food			1
' thanks to my team for squeezing in a quick birthday celebration on this v hectic day			1
' the pm was presented with a caterpillar birthday cake by foreign secretary @entity23 ( centre ) and chief of staff @entity25 ( right ) today he tweeted before his keynote speech , telling his followers : ' i ’m levelling with the @entity29 people in my speech at 11.30			1
it 's sink or swim , do or decline			1
how we 'll ensure @entity29 wins the @entity35			2
' and as he left the conference venue in @entity38 he added : ' just leaving what has been a great # cpc12			2
a big thank you to all involved , we really showed that ' @entity29 can deliver			2
' in 2009 the @entity44 leader told @entity47 ’s @entity46 breakfast show : ‘ the trouble with @entity10 , the instantness of it – too many twits might make a t * * *			2
’ but with millions of people – and potential voters – on the site , the lure of @entity10 became too strong to resist			2
on saturday night mr @entity2 announced his arrival on the site with a reference to his 2009 warning : ‘ i 'm starting @entity60 with this new @entity10 feed about my role as @entity63			2
i promise there wo n't be " too many tweets ... ’ on monday mr @entity2 used the @ @entity67 account to reveal he had packed some boxes for the # supportoursoldiers campaign here is a selection of some of the comments which @ @entity13 is being bombarded with : ‏ @entity74 , what atrocities are you planning to inflict on the working classes today then ? # toriesruiningthenation @ @entity78 today you say that @entity29 has no future unless difficult decisions are taken			2
i do n't think you understand concept of time			2
‏ @ @entity84 : how are you getting away with killing off so many sick and disabled you turd ? when are you going to be up in court for it ? @ @entity87 , this is your daily reminder that thousands of @entity29 's most vulnerable people are suffering more thanks to you			0
@ thisisamy _ i am seriously angry by @ @entity13 's comments			0
stop lying & pretending you 're helping the poor & vulnerable			0
you do not care one bit			0
why are n't your sleeves rolled up , @entity87 ? ‏ @ hoolscon spare us the mush about your family @entity87 , your a rich boy who inherited his wealth so do n't try make out your one of us plebs ‏ @ bethemediauk i thought you said you would n't tweet much			0
before the account was set up aides promised it would be an ‘ edgy ’ and ‘ more political ’ outlet for the prime minister to target voters			1
the official @entity115 accounts is covered by @entity117 rules on impartiality and can not be used for party political purposes			1
to date it has been rather more sedate , consisting of posts praising speeches by colleagues , alerting people to imminent tv appearances and photos of charity work			1
the response has been rather more boisterous than the @entity112 ’s own tweets , with users posting a stream of abuse often aimed at mr @entity2 ’s wealth			1
mr @entity2 defended his decision to join the site this week			0
he told @entity136 : ' in this modern world you have got to use every means to try and communicate your message and explain to people why you are doing it			0
' you 've got to get with the programme , i suppose			0
' before the account was set up , sources close to the pm said they wanted to use it as political tool to reach voters directly			1
' he wants something that ’s able to be more political , ’ said a party source			1
‘ especially when it comes down to the local , @entity154 and general elections he needs something where he can connect more directly with the voters as leader of the @entity44			0
’ mr @entity2 was the 370th mp to start an account			0
so far mr @entity2 has not interacted with any voters , or even the 34 @entity44 mps and peers he is following			0
within 12 hours the account had 75,000 followers but bookmakers @entity166 were offering odds of 25/1 that he would reach 100,000 before the @entity44 conference in @entity169 closed today			0
on sunday @entity2 tweeted : ' about to appear on @ @entity170 : i 'll be explaining how we 're on the side of people who want to get on in life			1
' the first photo the @entity112 posted : ' today i met the nursing team at the @entity178 , and announced £ 140m to help their work across the country ' he passed that landmark early on tuesday , later posting : i 'm told some bookmakers are regretting laying odds against this account passing 100,000 followers during conference			1
’ ladbrokes are now offering odds of 1/2 that he will reach a million followers by the end of the @entity194 punters can get 20/1 that the account will be closed before 2013			0
with just a few hours to go until the close of the party conference , the bookies are offering odds of 4/1 that mr @entity2 will unfollow @entity201 's account before the party leaves @entity169			0
aides say the next target is to overtake @entity206 ’s account , which has 166,000 followers			1
but the @entity209 's use of the site has not been without controversy , famously paying tribute to blockbusters host @entity213 with the hashtag # @entity215			0
the prime minister 's first tweet made reference to his 2009 warning that ' too many tweets might make a t * * * '			0

aides had promised ' edgy ' output which could be more political than official @entity115 accounts
so far it has been a little on the dull side , *highlighting* tv appearances and charity work
the response from other users has been more boisterous , with a stream of foul - *mouthed* abuse aimed at the pm
