in years to come @entity0 will tell his grandchildren about the three minutes he played for @entity2 in the @entity4 final against @entity6 ’s @entity5 , not the 120 minutes he played for @entity7 in the @entity9 final against @entity11 ’s @entity10			1
and so it is time for @entity13 to seriously deliver at the @entity14			1
@entity15 – all of sudden he ’s gone from being the one who does n’t quite fit in at @entity18 to the man who will make @entity7 world beaters			0
it happened last summer , too			0
@entity26 went from being the lazy one at @entity31 to the ‘ new @entity32 ’ at @entity7			1
the @entity9 gave the fans a great day out , but seeing @entity7 players win the @entity4 is a reality check for @entity36 who are letting @entity13 get away with it			1
after waiting all this time they should demand more			0
and in fairness to @entity36 they do want more			0
in fact they are so desperate for more , they have hijacked @entity2 ’s @entity4 success as some sort of trophy for @entity7			1
@entity26 had a decent game in the final but in the words of @entity50 legend @entity49 was ‘ walking ’ through the @entity4 before that			2
@entity0 came on for the last few minutes of the final but @entity2 only started to look like serious contenders after he was dropped before the quarter final against @entity55			2
and @entity25 is @entity7 ’s version of @entity57			2
he put the kit on for the celebrations and would n’t let go of the @entity4			0
landing the big one : @entity26 celebrates with the @entity4 trophy @entity61 is not the colour : @entity63 celebrates with @entity64 - but no @entity66 fans are claiming credit for the win the reality is that a @entity66 player , @entity63 , was more influential for @entity2 than the three @entity36 combined			1
yet i do n’t hear @entity66 fans trying to claim they won the @entity4			2
probably because they are n’t so desperate to claim any kind of football success as @entity7 supporters are			2
so with @entity26 a year into his @entity7 career , @entity76 fully fit and firing , @entity15 having arrived , as well as @entity79			0
world class or misfit ? @entity7 signed former @entity18 forward @entity15 set to join : @entity82 could be on his way to @entity7 , as could @entity84 defender @entity79 and talk of @entity82 ( absolutely nothing stopping @entity13 signing the @entity31 man ) on his way , what should @entity7 be aiming for ? @entity13 has had 18 years at the club and his job is under no threat whatsoever			0
that kind of stability should give the @entity23 an advantage			0
he is now being allowed to spend serious money			0
so do @entity7 fans have the balls to set @entity13 a target and judge him by it ? would you be happy with the @entity9 and fourth place next year ? i hope not			1
time to do more : @entity7 must win more than the @entity9 to be considered a sucess @entity108 trophy not enough - @entity106 step up : @entity13 celebrates winning the @entity9 but he must target the @entity109 @entity7 are bigger than that , and they now have players who are too big for that			1
a real target , something to make the manager earn his money ( it seems all he has to do is sign a player and @entity7 fans forgive him the barren years these days ) , is to win either the @entity109 title , or the @entity121			1
gooners should settle for no less with the prices they pay , and the patience they ’ve shown			0
having @entity4 winners in the dressing room will lend true perspective on @entity13 ’s last 10 seasons without a title , and his whole career without any @entity132 success			1
with his years of experience , no pressure of the sack , and money to spend , now is the time for @entity13 to show us he has still got it .			0

@entity7 *wrong* to claim @entity4 *victory* as theirs just because @entity0 , @entity25 , and @entity26 were in @entity2 *squad*
@entity9 gave @entity7 fans a good day out at @entity144 - but they must aim *higher* this season
time for @entity13 to deliver @entity109 or @entity132 success
