by @entity0 last updated at 3:41 pm on 1st march 2012 a homeowner fed up with a spate of vandalism attacks on his street decided to take matters into his own to ensnare the hooligan responsible			2
so @entity7 set up a £ 300 cctv system in the hope of catching the yob in the act			1
but the mystery attacker keying cars and ripping off wing mirrors outside his home in @entity17 , north @entity12 was not some feral youth			0
the perpetrator caught on camera was a well - dressed man in suit trousers , an overcoat and carryning a rucksack			1
caught in the act : the mystery attacker boots the wing mirror of mr @entity7 's @entity27 in january the smartly - dressed mystery vandal then wanders away off camera from outside mr @entity7 's home in @entity17 , north @entity12 mr @entity7 spent £ 300 on the @entity32 system which caught the vandal , and has since handed the footage to the @entity35 the @entity32 captured the smartly - dressed man ripping off the wing mirror of mr @entity7 ' blue 4x4 @entity27 and kicking it across the street on january 14			1
