a top @entity0 has lost a costly legal battle over the sale of a £ 3.6million country manor after pulling out of the deal when he discovered the property was riddled with dry rot and rising damp			1
leading barrister @entity8 and his wife @entity9 thought they had found their dream home when they viewed @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 , in 2010			1
they exchanged contracts with owner @entity18 on @entity19 in 2011 but were hauled before the courts after refusing to pay for the property because they were concerned about rising damp , wet and dry rot and timber decay			1
they have now lost a lengthy legal battle in @entity28 's @entity27 and face a £ 385,000 bill after a judge ruled they had breached the contract by trying to rescind the agreement			1
@entity8 and his wife @entity9 ( together left ) have been successfully sued by @entity18 ( right ) after they pulled out of buying @entity13 in @entity15 for £ 3.6million after exchanging contracts mr and mrs @entity36 had originally agreed to buy @entity13 , in @entity15 ( pictured ) , for £ 3.6million , but later pulled out after receiving the results of a survey which said it was ' riddled with damp and dry rot ' the issue began when mr @entity41 , 66 , an ' eminent ' planning and property lawyer , and his wife exchanged contracts on the multi-million pound property with bricklaying tycoon mr @entity18 , 56 , before seeking any professional advice on the mansion 's condition			1
a survey later revealed evidence of penetrating and rising damp , as well as wet and dry rot and signs of timber decay , the @entity27 heard			0
in light of the survey , @entity18 and mrs @entity36 , who had wanted a home in ' pristine ' condition , refused to stump up the balance of a 10 per cent deposit			2
however , mr @entity18 and his wife , @entity60 , responded by tearing up the contract and refusing to refund the £ 150,000 deposit the @entity41 had already paid			1
the couples ended up in court where judge @entity65 today handed a resounding victory to @entity18 and mrs @entity67			1
the @entity41 not only forfeited their £ 150,000 deposit , but were ordered to pay @entity18 and mrs @entity67 £ 235,000 damages for breach of contract			1
the main reception room at @entity13 , which was built in the mid- 19th century by sir @entity73 mr and mrs @entity36 claimed that a survey revealed the 150 - year - old property was badly affected by damp in a final blow to the @entity0 , judge @entity76 found that mr @entity41 made a better advocate than a witness			1
having appeared on his feet in court countless times , the barrister ' found it difficult to simply answer the question put '			0
he ' could not resist arguing his case ' from the witness box , the judge said , before adding : ' i prefer the evidence of mr @entity18 to that of mr @entity41 '			2
mr @entity41 earlier told the court that he ' tended to leave these things to his wife '			0
however , he agreed that he was ' much keener ' on @entity13 than she was			2
the couple insisted in court that they had been the victims of ' reckless misrepresentation '			2
the master bedroom in the £ 3.6million country manor , in @entity15 , which has a total of 30 rooms the spacious kitchen of @entity13 ( left ) and the marbled floor as you enter the building ( right ) they claimed devout church - goer mr @entity18 and his 55 - year - old wife had gravely misled them about the mansion 's condition			1
they also complained that @entity18 and mrs @entity67 had made ' excessive and unreasonable demands '			2
the couple also said they had discovered to their ' horror ' that a small but ' extremely significant ' plot of land had been sold off from the grounds			0
however , judge @entity76 accepted mr @entity18 's ' careful ' evidence that he had never had the house surveyed and was unaware of any damp problem			1
exonerating the @entity126 , the judge said they had an ' unconditional right ' to cancel the contract when @entity18 and mrs @entity36 failed to pay the balance of the deposit or complete on time			2
the @entity126 were entitled to pocket the deposit , to re-sell the mansion to someone else and to sue the @entity41 for damages , she ruled			0
the house was on the market for £ 4.5million and @entity18 and mrs @entity36 had agreed to buy it for £ 3.6million the manor also boasts a helicopter pad ( pictured ) as well as gym , cinema , 12 acre garden and staff quarters a surveyor 's report indicated that there was ' extensive rising damp , dry rot and timber decay ' in the property @entity13 was originally built between 1760 and 1780 although it is unknown how much of the original building remains			1
it was bought by sir @entity73 , a lord mayor and @entity154 in the 1840s			0
he was a close friend of @entity156 and @entity157 and admired their summer residence of @entity160 , which also has a similar @entity162 style tower to @entity13			0
the @entity164 's family lived in the property for more than 70 years and it was sold in 1911 to a private buyer			0
in 1930 it was bought by the @entity168 , who used it as an office until the 1990s			0
it was then bought over and restored to its former glory by a private owner			0
@entity176 , for @entity18 and mrs @entity67 , earlier pointed out that the contract contained a ' common ' clause used in conveyancing , whereby the @entity0 and his wife agreed to accept and pay for the property based on its state of repair at the time of signing			1
they had viewed the property several times , once with an architect , but had signed the contract on april 1 , 2011 , the day after agreeing the £ 3.6million price			1
they had done so without first obtaining a survey report , which did not arrive until a month later , the court heard			0
mr @entity194 added : ' the vendor is a lay person in matters of law ... the purchaser is an eminent @entity0 with property expertise			0
' the property was accepted in the physical state it was in at the time of contract and you ca n't go back on that			0
' if it is damp , it is accepted with damp '			0
the 30 - room mansion is set in 12 acres of countryside and its architecture has been compared to that of @entity156 @entity156 's much - loved summer home , @entity160 on the @entity215			0
it was built by @entity156 @entity156 's friend , sir @entity73 , in the mid- 19th century			0
it is believed that @entity13 has since been sold to another purchaser for the same £ 3.6million price tag			1
mr @entity18 now lives in @entity14 with his wife , manages a church , and has business interests valued at £ 17m .			2

@entity8 and his wife exchanged contracts on @entity13
agreed to buy the property from brick tycoon @entity18 for £ 3.6million
couple did not see a surveyor 's report until after exchanging the contracts
then tried to rescind the agreement claiming ' reckless *misinterpretation* '
judge ruled today that they breached contract and they face £ 385,000 bill
