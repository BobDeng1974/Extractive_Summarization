by @entity0 published : 10:53 est , 11 october 2012 updated : 09:55 est , 12 october 2012 prepare for a new addition to the @entity3 language , with ' @entity4 ' on the rise			2
the hybrid child of @entity8 and @entity3 , the language is now becoming @entity10 's most important language - to the extent that @entity13 diplomats posted to the country have now been told they will need to learn the language			1
@entity4 is not so much its own language , but the free mixing of @entity8 and @entity3 words and sentence structures - even within a single sentence			1
while this mixing has occurred since colonial times , it is now maturing and spreading across the country - meaning a diplomat without some understanding of the @entity8 words can be left out of the loop in conversations or miss nuances which could affect relationships and business deals			1
@entity3 tourists teach young monks how to speak @entity36 : the use of @entity3 has given rise to ' @entity4 ' for 200 years , @entity3 has always been a ' language of choice ' for businesses , private schools and the upper classes meanwhile words have always moved freely between the two languages - words we used every day in @entity3 - speaking countries such as shampoo and pyjamas have their origins in @entity10			1
a @entity8 speaker writing in @entity3 on a black board ( stock image ) but with many @entity10 tv channels and movies now freely mixing the two languages , the impact is now spreading into other areas of life			2
it is also spreading across the country - with cheaper televisions and access to the internet spreading across rural areas spreading the influence further than the cities			0
@entity68 , which first reported the shift in diplomatic policy , reported how @entity72 films regularly use @entity3			0
meanwhile advertisements on television will mix the two languages , such as a recent shampoo advertisement which had the slogan : ' come on girls , waqt hai shine karne ka ! ' - or ' it 's time to shine '			0
whereas diplomats needed previously to be simply fluent in @entity3 , it is now not seen as sufficient - particularly for business matters			2
a @entity13 high commission spokesman told @entity68 : ' the @entity84 is placing increasing importance on the ability to transact business in foreign languages			0
' @entity3 news channels often have a portion where people choose to express themselves in @entity8 because it captures what they 're trying to say better than the @entity3 equivalent , so it 's increasingly important for @entity13 diplomats to be able to appreciate the nuances			0

diplomats told they must must learn @entity4 before starting their post
without understanding , diplomats may be left out of the look on business deals and relationships
we do it too - words like ' shampoo ' and ' pyjamas ' originally began as @entity10 words
