by @entity1 reporter when you go to an agricultural show it is highly likely that you will see some cattle			0
but the @entity6 possibly did not expect to find herself talking to one			0
especially one with a sign reading ‘ free hugs ’ taped to its belly			1
@entity11 , @entity6 , left , asked @entity12 , right , whether or not she was being fed while dressed in her cow costume at the @entity14 in @entity15 @entity11 ended up deep in conversation with the black - and - white cow – in reality , 19 - year - old @entity12 in a fluffy but less than convincing costume – as she visited the @entity14 in @entity20 , @entity15 , yesterday			1
@entity21 stroked the cow costume ears , asking the teenager ' how long do you have to stay in there ? ' and ' are they feeding you ? '			2
the encounter took place in the young farmers ' club tent and the @entity6 , who is president of the @entity14 and @entity33 , went on to tour the cattle and livestock rings , the @entity27 stands and the food halls			2
@entity21 also met farmers affected by the severe floods at the start of the year			0
unfortunately for the organisers of the @entity14 and @entity43 show in @entity15 , the weather was quite wintery as she walked around , @entity11 accepted the offer to try some ciders , and in the blind test picked one with a name close to home - @entity48 - as her favourite			1
for her efforts trying tipples from the @entity53 she was given a badge , which she proudly wore , that said " i am a cider judge "			0
prince @entity55 , meanwhile , was in @entity56 , where he toured a medieval church in @entity58			1
@entity55 is said to be descended from @entity59 , the bloodthirsty ruler who inspired @entity60 .			0
