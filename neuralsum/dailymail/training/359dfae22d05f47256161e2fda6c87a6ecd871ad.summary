it is the crime we have accused the @entity2 of for decades – hogging the sun loungers			1
but now , it seems , holidaying @entity6 might have to throw in the towel in the battle for the moral high ground by the swimming pool			2
for it is us , and not them , who are more likely to get up early , creep down from our hotel rooms and bag the coveted spots , at least according to an investigation by the mass - selling @entity2 newspaper @entity18			1
@entity18 apparently took two photos : the first at 7.36am showing all the sun loungers empty and towel free , the second at 9.21am showing most of the sun loungers bedecked with a towel – including one emblazoned with a @entity45 and one with a @entity46 – but still not a human on them			1
when the lounger baggers eventually turned up to claim their spots , the paper ’s reporter went to find out who they are – and it then printed the findings under the headline : ‘ photo evidence in the war of the towels			2
the @entity61 are the worst lounger squatters ! ’ the paper focuses on three families it identifies as @entity6 and says the hotel is filled with @entity61 holidaymakers			2
however , it does n’t detail the owners of the other pictured towels			2
potentially they could all belong to @entity6			0
one family was identified in @entity18 as @entity71 , 49 , @entity72 , 19 , and @entity73 , 12			0
they said they claimed their sun loungers earlier , including laying a towel decorated with images of @entity61 soccer stars on one , because a party of @entity82 vacationers ‘ stole ’ them all the day before			0
one - nil to @entity61 : @entity18 identified @entity73 and his mother @entity71 as among those who bagged their spots early ‘ not enough places ’ : @entity87 , 43 , from @entity88 , @entity89 , at the holiday resort with daughters @entity91 and @entity93 car mechanic @entity87 , 43 , from @entity88 , @entity89 , holidaying with daughters @entity91 , nine , and @entity93 , seven , and proud owner of a @entity45 towel , said : ‘ i was in a queue at 8.50am			1
without a reservation you do n’t stand a chance			1
there are simply not enough places for everyone			0
’ asked if @entity2 or @entity6 were the worst poolside hogs he said : ‘ i do n’t know			1
we often have exchange students staying from @entity2			0
i find them very polite and friendly			0
’ the third family identified , @entity108 , 52 , from @entity109 , @entity110 , and her husband @entity111 , said they bagged their places because ‘ everybody does it			0
’ another tourist , @entity115 , 55 , from @entity116 , put towels on seven loungers for her family			0
‘ if we all want to be together we have no other choice , ’ she told @entity18			0
it is the latest skirmish in the long - running battle of the sun loungers and follows another recent article in @entity18 which mocked @entity6 on foreign holidays for being drunken , stupid , overweight , lecherous , tattooed and sunburnt			1
‘ everyone does it ’ : @entity108 , 52 , husband @entity111 and son @entity130 , from @entity109 , @entity110 , said they are doing no different to anyone else it poked fun at @entity6 men abroad with ‘ red and white chests ’ and the women with ‘ underwear amnesia ’ – and suggested we have ‘ prince @entity139 ’ , which it described as a compulsive need to undress			0
it also referred to the condition ‘ balcony leg ’ which it blamed on @entity6 injuring themselves trying to jump into the hotel pool			2
a survey of @entity2 holidaymakers in june claimed @entity6 tourists are second only to @entity151 when it comes to nationalities they dislike most on holiday			1
the research by @entity2 travel operator @entity156 found @entity2 viewed @entity6 as both loud and all too often drunk .			1

@entity2 newspaper @entity18 carried out investigation into sun lounger hoggers
it monitored activity at hotel in @entity35 resort of @entity23 , @entity24
found @entity6 tourists ' reserved ' loungers with their towels early in *morning*
@entity87 , from @entity89 , said : ' without a reservation you do n’t stand a chance '
