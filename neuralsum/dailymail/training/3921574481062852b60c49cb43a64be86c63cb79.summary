a pet owner who bought a tortoise on @entity2 for £ 100 was stunned when it arrived duct - taped to the inside of a cereal box			1
the animal was reportedly left dazed and confused after a horror journey lasting around 18 hours from @entity8 to @entity9 , @entity10 - 500 miles away			1
the buyer said he was shocked at the ' inhumane ' treatment and had paid extra money for a polystyrene box with straw bedding			1
i would walk 500 miles : a tortoise was sent from @entity8 to @entity10 - duct - taped to a cereal box ( pictured ) instead , he received a purple @entity22 box with the pet stuffed inside			1
the man , who asked to remain anonymous , told @entity26 's @entity25 he already owned one tortoise and had bought a new one to keep his pet company			1
he also owns dogs and cats , and used to keep iguanas			0
he told the @entity25 : ' there was duct tape all over him and he could n't move			0
everyone knows tortoises are slow , but they need exercise when in transit			0
' he was very cold when he arrived , and , to be honest , i thought he was dead			1
' the man added the tortoise he received was not even the one in the photo			2
the man said of his new pet : ' he was very cold when he arrived , and , to be honest , i thought he was dead ' ' looking back , the seller should 've been able to answer more questions than he did , ' he admitted			1
government regulations say all animals must be transported ' in a way that does not or is not likely to cause injury or undue suffering to them			0
' the rules add : ' @entity54 , loading and unloading may be stressful to some animals as a result of unaccustomed and unfamiliar surroundings			0
' it is important , therefore , that everyone involved in these operations is aware of the correct action to take to minimise adverse effects in handling and transport and of the effects on the animals if these procedures are not followed properly			0
' the buyer has been urged to pass details of the incident to the @entity72			2
tortoise owners are advised to used a box slightly bigger than the animal , with enough space for it to stretch its legs but not to move freely around			1
the container should have air holes and not be transparent , because tortoises can get stressed if they see the world moving at high speed around them			0
there should be straw bedding into which the tortoise can burrow a little and hide in the dark			2
this will encourage the animal to sleep through the journey without noticing the time going by			2
it is also more comfortable and also helps absorb shocks or knocks			0
any box should be secured tightly in the boot of a car or if it is being posted , it must have live animal stickers by law and be sent with a specialist courier or delivery firm			1
tortoises can urinate into their bedding during the journey , so they should be bathed and brought into fresh surroundings as soon as possible afterwards			0
