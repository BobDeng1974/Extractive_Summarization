the power of word association is amazing			2
' let 's go away for the weekend to @entity4 , ' i say one morning to my seven - year - old son , @entity5			1
his little face lights up			2
' yes , dad ! ' he beams			2
' @entity4 ! ' ' no , not @entity8 , ' i reply			0
' suddenly , he 's not so enthusiastic			1
maybe the @entity11 capital is n't the most obvious destination for a long weekend with two young children			1
or is it ? a new travel company reckons so			1
@entity16 specialises in privately owned rental properties , most of them in urban settings			1
the unique selling point being that the properties are both child - friendly and stylish			1
taking flight : a carousel in @entity4 , which is full of parks and rides that will entertain children the company offers houses and apartments in @entity31 and across the world			1
typically , you 'll pay about £ 150 a night - so in most cases it 's cheaper than staying in a hotel			1
you have to make your own travel arrangements			1
we 've come to @entity4 by train , which could n't be easier or quicker , and are booked into the @entity41 residence in the 13th arrondissement			0
a former artist 's studio once owned by sculptor @entity45 - the man who designed the statuette ( it 's known as a @entity41 ) that 's awarded to film stars at the @entity11 equivalent of the @entity49 - it costs about £ 270 a night			1
we 're a family of four , but six people could sleep comfortably			1
@entity53 and high - ceilinged , with a galleried bedroom which opens onto the living room , there are framed portraits everywhere , and paint spatters on the tiny , twisty staircase			2
@entity61 enjoys an ice cream near the @entity63 the dining chairs are deliberately mismatched and a bit bashed			0
one is so orange and furry that i wonder if @entity68 has been killed and skinned in order to create it			0
what 's more , it 's a real family home			1
it 's only available to rent when the owners are out of town			2
there 's none of that antiseptic emptiness you sometimes find in holiday rental properties			1
instead , there 's all the family 's stuff to use : toys , @entity84 , a telescope pointed at the stars			1
we 're in a totally untouristy neighbourhood , down a private alleyway , about 20 minutes by @entity90 from the most famous bits of the city			0
a recipe for boredom ? as it turns out , not at all			0
yet , it all starts out badly			0
our children have never been to @entity4 before , so we make the short journey to the @entity63 , which we 've been talking about for weeks			0
but when we get there , the queue is 3½ hours long			0
frankly , my wife and i are not too bothered			0
the children moan , but not for long			0
the best view of the tower itself is from the bottom , i tell them			0
we grab some ice creams and crêpes , then go for a whirl on an imposing doubledecker carousel a few yards away , and spend an hour and a half on an open - top bus tour			2
from the top deck , our children ( not always the easiest to entertain ) , lap up their new surroundings - though the bus is shockingly expensive			2
they also lap up the playgrounds			0
@entity4 is awash with climbing frames , slides and swings			0
there 's a lovely local park - the @entity127 - right near our apartment , with an amazing setup of twisty castle , pirate ship , swings etc. but town planners have also plonked swings and roundabouts all over the centre of town			1
there 's some play equipment slap - bang next to the @entity139 , for example			1
so it 's very easy to do a bit of adult time , then a bit of child time			1
home from home : the @entity149 family stayed in a former artist 's studio once owned by sculptor @entity45 and that , i think , is the secret of the trip 's success			1
using neighbourhood parks - intended for local residents - is brilliant			2
as is the fact that our home comes with the family 's bikes , scooters and @entity11 lps			1
the next day , in order not to miss out on a rooftop view of the city , we head to @entity169			0
one of the highlights of the weekend , oddly , is a busker we encounter there , at the bottom of the funicular which goes up to the @entity175 at the top of the hill			0
he blows huge , colourful bubbles above the children 's heads			2
we eat well wherever we go : steak , duck , snails			0
our four - year - old , @entity61 , who wo n't let a tomato pass her lips at home , demands l'escargot at every restaurant			1
and when it 's all over , i feel we 've seen two sides of @entity4			2
the world - famous bit aimed at visitors — and a glimpse of residential @entity4			2
not many tourists can claim to have experienced that combination			0
the @entity203 in @entity204 , @entity4 , costs from £ 270 a night including all fees , and sleeps up to six			0
minimum stay is three nights ( 001 212 905 6065 , kidandcoe.com )			0
return fares from @entity210 to @entity4 with @entity211 ( 08432 186 186 , eurostar.com ) start at £ 69 .			0
