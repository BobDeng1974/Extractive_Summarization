by @entity0 you ’d be forgiven for thinking console gaming was thriving - following major launches of new consoles from @entity5 and @entity6 , plus a series of high - profile games			1
but some experts are taking a much more sober view			0
although video games spending is expected to grow by 10 per cent this year , only $ 4 ( £ 2 ) in every $ 10 ( £ 6 ) in the industry is set to come from disc - based games played on consoles and @entity15 the rising popularity of online games , and the increase in mobile gaming , has led to a drop in traditional games as we know them			1
experts predict only $ 4 ( £ 2 ) in every $ 10 ( £ 6 ) in 2014 will come from console games			1
disc - based games will account for just 41 % of all video games revenue , down from 68 % in 2009 , while online games will jump to 31 % and mobile will account for 28 % of games strategy analytics claim that over the next year , disc - based games will account for just 41 per cent of all video games revenue , down from 68 per cent five years ago			1
online games will make up 31 per cent of revenue - up from 21 per cent in 2009 - while mobile is expected to account for 28 per cent of games sales – two and a half times its 11 per cent share , five years ago			1
‘ disc - based games have suffered from the emergence of digital gaming and wo n’t ever recapture the peak years of the @entity42 and @entity43 generations , ’ said @entity37 , analyst at @entity38			1
senior analyst @entity44 from @entity45 told @entity46 : ‘ in addition , more consumers are downloading games , eschewing the physical copies			2
although video games spending is expected to grow by 10 per cent this year , only $ 4 ( £ 2 ) in every $ 10 ( £ 6 ) is set to come from disc - based games , played on consoles and @entity15 online games will account for 31 per cent of revenue - up from 21 per cent in 2009			1
while mobile is expected to account for 28 per cent of games sales - two and a half times its 11 per cent share , five years ago			1
around 28 million consoles were shipped globally in 2013 , half the volume shipped five years ago			0
however shipments are expected to jump 14 per cent in 2014 to 32 million units			2
this has been helped by the release of @entity5 's @entity64 and @entity6 's @entity65			0
experts predict spending on disc - based games to peak again 2016 , but further growth depends on more the launch of @entity72 micro-consoles such as @entity73 , @entity75 ’s @entity74 and @entity77 ’s @entity76			1
‘ @entity78 is popular because so many of us have these devices in our possession throughout most of the day , but it ’s important to see the delineation between mobile and what many call core gaming			0
’ and @entity87 , research director of consumer technology and markets at @entity90 added : ‘ console games today are still very expensive when you compare purchase price with mobile games , and gamers are starting to realise they can get value from less expensive content			1
’ mobile gaming is popular because the devices are portable and the games are cheap – usually selling for less than £ 3 ( $ 5 ) , or are free , but funded by in - app purchases			1
mobile gaming , stock image pictured , is popular because the devices are portable and the games are cheap , or even free			0
mobile games are still relatively small in size compared to console titles , and mobile processors are improving in order to match and rival those found on consoles while mobile games are still relatively small in download size , console titles can be quite large , too			1
due to the recent surge in mobile gaming , the industry is increasingly supporting mobile , and the processors are steadily becoming more powerful , in order to rival consoles			2
@entity87 told @entity46 : ‘ @entity78 is the fastest growing category in the video game market and because mobile game apps are always with you , there is also a large number of players and also a big engagement with those types of apps			2
around 28 million consoles were shipped globally in 2013			0
shipments are expected to jump 14 per cent in 2014 to 32 million units , helped by the release of @entity6 's @entity65 , pictured ‘ so as part of an overall game market , because of the rise of mobile , you can say that other parts of the market are shrinking			2
’ ‘ it ’s important to note that the console manufacturers also considered going ‘ disc-less ’ for this generation but determined the market was n’t ready yet - so the removal of the disc drive is not necessarily indicative of a decline in the console market but rather a likely inevitable transition down the road , ’ @entity144 continued			2
‘ when you factor in download speeds , data caps , and limited storage space , the timing was n’t right for disc-less gaming on a wholesale level			0
‘ it ’s also worth noting @entity6 and @entity5 are helping to explore the opportunities with cloud gaming			0
' @entity37 explained console obituaries are premature for three reasons : ‘ firstly , a large enough gaming enthusiast segment remain devoted to console gaming			1
' secondly , while smartphone and tablets have taken market share they have exposed more people to gaming than ever before - a small but significant proportion of ‘ mobile first ’ gamers graduate to dedicated handheld or home consoles , sustaining the market			2
‘ thirdly , the companies are deeply committed to investing in the perpetuation of the console model			0
aside from games , it ’s a key [ strategy ] into the connected living room for @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity188 and perhaps others in future such as @entity191 and @entity192			0
’ console sales to date have been strong for @entity6 and @entity5 , but weak for @entity188 , the @entity194 pictured , and this is contributing to overall lower numbers for the 8th generation of consoles around 28 million consoles were shipped globally in 2013 , half the volume shipped five years ago			2
however , shipments are expected to jump 14 per cent in 2014 to 32 million units			0
‘ it will take years before the consoles fully transition to digital downloads and that will remove some of the buying friction , ’ continued @entity87			0
‘ there is a very loyal console and pc user base , and those types of gamers drive a significant portion of the game market			0
’ console sales to date have been strong for @entity6 and @entity5 , but weak for @entity188 and this is contributing to overall lower numbers for the 8th generation of consoles			0
analyst @entity37 said : ' humans have always played games			0
given the breadth of innovation set to hit the market over the next few years - whether its the @entity225 , pictured , or the lively @entity72 - based micro-console scene - there has never been a better time to love playing video games ' @entity37 claimed there should be enough interest to sustain ‘ at least two high - end games consoles for another hardware generation after the current one			1
’ experts predict spending on disc - based games to peak in 2016 , but further growth depends on more value - oriented plays from @entity72 micro-consoles such as @entity73 , @entity75 ’s @entity74 and @entity77 ’s @entity76			1
‘ humans have always played games , it ’s up to the industry to provide the outlets which best match contemporary habits			0
‘ given the breadth of innovation set to hit the market over the next few years – whether its the @entity225 , @entity250 or the lively @entity72 - based micro-console scene - there has never been a better time to love playing video games			1

experts predict only $ 4 in every $ 10 in 2014 will come from console games
disc - based games will account for just 41 per cent of all video games revenue , down from 68 per cent in 2009
online games will jump to 31 % and mobile will account for 28 % of games
industry *insiders* say there has been a shift away from consoles to mobile
this is because mobile games are more *convenient* and cheaper
but console obituaries are ' premature ' as firms will adapt to suit demand
