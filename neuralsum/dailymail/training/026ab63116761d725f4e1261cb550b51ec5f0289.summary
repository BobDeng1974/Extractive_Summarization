more than two million @entity1 are trapped in ' modern - day slavery ' , condemned to a lifetime of hardship to pay back supposed debts , labour campaigners say			1
laws have been in place since the early 1990s to outlaw bonded labour , but still the cycle continues , with thousands of children sucked in every year to help pay back money their parents have often borrowed out of desperation			1
at an open - air factory on the edge of @entity19 , around 90 miles north of @entity16 , tall , tapering chimneys belch out noxious smoke			2
crouching children gather lumps of clay and pack them into rectangular moulds			1
on the ground , long rows of unbaked bricks wait to go into the kiln			1
these are the scenes that have been the backdrop to @entity48 's life since he was a child			1
for several decades he has worked in a brick kiln as a bonded labourer , tied to his employer by a debt his salary will never enable him to repay			1
the father - of - three said : ' i 've spent the last 40 - odd years in this grind , sometimes in one factory , sometimes in another			2
' @entity48 works seven days a week at the coal - fired kiln , where 1,000 bricks will earn him a little over £ 1 , every cent of which goes straight back to his employer			1
' i borrowed 40,000 - 50,000 rupees ( £ 413 - 516 ) to buy food for my children			1
i will never pay it back before i die - my debt will die with me			1
' a global survey of slavery published last month by the @entity32 campaign group the @entity31 said @entity1 had the third most ' slaves ' in the world , after @entity35 and @entity36			1
most work in brick making or agriculture			2
@entity31 says the government needs regulate brick kilns and enforce anti-slavery laws			1
@entity77 says little about why he took out the loan in the first place			2
from buying food to wedding dowries to hospital visits - there is no shortage of reasons why workers enter into lifelong deals with their employers			2
@entity89 , who set up a brickworkers ' union in @entity19 a few years ago , said : ' before the union , the workers here did n't even have names , just numbers			2
if someone came and asked them their name , they 'd say ' ask the boss , he 'll tell you			2
' from buying food to wedding dowries to hospital visits - there is no shortage of reasons why workers enter into lifelong employment deals and the debt often escalates , as accommodation and food costs are often added			0
some small trade unions are lobbying bosses to raise salaries to the equivalent of $ 3 a day and to not trap their workers in the debt cycle			0

' but despite their best efforts the unions are fighting a difficult battle			0
a few employers may have improved wages and conditions , but the unions have not persuaded any to free bonded labourers			1
but some workers , like @entity138 , have been able to escape			0
five years ago the owner of a rice and pepper farm where he had worked for years with his family demanded £ 2,877 , claiming their work had not covered the cost of feeding them			0
mr @entity138 's uncle went to the @entity147 , a campaign group , which took the matter to court			0
some small trade unions are lobbying bosses to raise salaries to the equivalent of $ 3 a day and to not trap their workers in the debt cycle workers debts often increase , rather than go down , as their employers add accommodation and food costs to the total they owe but things only got worse for the farmer and his family			1
mr @entity138 claims the owner and his men threw him and his extended family in vehicles and drove them into the desert ' chained like animals '			0
after days of being held captive , the 87 members of @entity138 's extended family , all from the @entity173 minority , were rescued by the police			0
mr @entity138 said : ' it was slavery , what else would you call it ? we were treated like animals , we worked day and night			0
' once freed , the family accusing the landowner of illegal detention , an audacious move in a country where the rich and powerful rule virtually unchallenged in rural areas			0
mr @entity138 and his family got more than £ 12,797 in an out - of - court settlement			0
he now lives in the village of @entity191 , near @entity19 , which is populated by former bonded labourers			1
@entity193 , the head of the @entity147 who set up @entity191 in 2006 , said they had managed to free 28,000 people , but around half of them have ended up back in bonded labour for want of any other work the family bought a minibus and mr @entity138 opened a grocery			1

for little @entity209 , her hands worn from work at just 12 years old , the future looks bleak			0
she has already spent years feeding animals , working in the fields , cleaning houses and pumping water for a landowner			0

we would say to them , ' why are you so cruel to us ? ' and they would reply ' pay me ! '			2
