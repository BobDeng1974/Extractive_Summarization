by @entity0 a man has been awarded £ 450,000 for being disabled at birth by blundering medics - after a psychic convinced the family to pursue their claim			1
@entity7 , 23 , of @entity8 , south @entity9 , has never been able to use his left arm after errors made during his birth			1
staff at the @entity15 in @entity16 , south @entity9 , used ' excessive force ' during his mother 's labour , and damaged nerves in her son 's neck , leaving his left arm and hand permanently paralysed , according to lawyers who won the payout			1
blunder : medics at the @entity15 ( pictured ) in south @entity9 applied ' excessive force ' when @entity7 was born , disabling him for life his mother , @entity31 , attempted to make a claim against the then @entity34 local health board when her son was four years old , but could n't find a firm which would take up her case			1
she thought her chances of a successful claim were small so gave up - but was persuaded years later to renew her efforts during a meeting with a psychic			1
she added : ' i visited a psychic in @entity9 who told me that my son would win a claim and she could see us very happy			2
i thought we had nothing to lose so @entity7 decided to give the claim another go			2
' claim : mr @entity7 's mother , @entity31 , was persuaded by a psychic to pursue the case ' @entity7 had a tough childhood growing up with no use in his arm			1
he was unable to play with other children , use his bicycle and the appearance of his arm also made him a target for bullying			0
i knew the way he was treated during the birth was n’t right and it was n’t any fault of his own			0
' spurred on by the spiritual advice , she approached @entity69 , who took up her claim and were able to secure the six - figure sum			2
the @entity73 local health board , the successor of the organisation responsible for mr @entity7 's treatment at birth , agreed to settle the matter out of court for £ 450,000			0
however , it did not admit full liability			0
acting solicitor in the case @entity82 said if the hospital had admitted the problem when it first occurred then the mr @entity7 ’ recovery would likely have been far better			0
she said : ' unfortunately , it took over 20 years for @entity7 and his mum to achieve justice for what happened			0
' the compensation secured for @entity7 takes into account the extent of the injuries he suffered and his future needs , and will allow him to enjoy an optimistic future with his wife and two children			0
