by @entity0 published : 20:00 est , 2 september 2012 updated : 04:34 est , 3 september 2012 love them or hate them , wood pigeons are starting to rule the roost in towns and cities across the @entity7			1
the bigger and hungrier cousin of the urban pigeon is being spotted in gardens in record numbers , with suburban lawns and bird tables particularly favoured			1
a survey of bird lovers by the @entity16 found wood pigeons , which are often accused of stealing food left out for smaller , more fragile birds , to have visited 87 per cent of gardens during a typical week this year			1
big eater : the wood pigeon is a big fan of suburban bird tables this makes them more frequently sighted than robins , great tits or house sparrows			2
in fact , the wood pigeon , which was once a strictly countryside bird , is developing such an affinity for city life that only blue tits and blackbirds were spotted more frequently			0
if the trend continues , the wood pigeon could soon rule the roost			2
changing agricultural practices - often blamed for the demise of other wildlife - are thought to be behind the population boom			0
in particular , increased planting of oil seed rape has provided the birds with large quantities of ' fresh greens ' to help seem them through the winter			0
@entity50 pigeons are more frequently spotted than robins and sparrows as their numbers have increased , they have ventured more into urban areas , where , safe from farmers who view them as vermin , they appear to have enjoyed the easy pickings on bird tables and in feeders			1
a spokesman for the @entity16 said : ' when it comes to gardens , wood pigeons prefer suburbia			2
keep out : use a cage to keep large wood pigeons off your bird table ' throughout the year , wood pigeons visit a greater proportion of suburban gardens than rural ones			1
' @entity50 pigeons are persecuted in rural areas as an agricultural pest , so individuals may be more likely to visit suburban gardens , where they feel less threatened			1
' alternatively , bird table fare , which is more widely available in suburban gardens , might be particularly attractive , drawing the birds into gardens			2
' however , not everyone is happy by the rise of the portly pigeons , which can be distinguished from those more traditionally seen in towns and cities by their bigger bodies and white collars			0
they have voracious appetites and often hog the bird table , swiftly eating the treats left for smaller birds			0
the @entity16 suggests buying seed mixes which are low on cereal , one the wood pigeon 's favoured foods			0
cages placed around bird tables and feeders will allow access for smaller bird while leaving wood pigeons to forage for themselves			0
dr @entity107 , of the @entity16 's @entity109 project , said : ' @entity50 pigeons cause ill - feeling amongst some garden bird enthusiasts - it is easy to see just a big stomach on legs			1
' but there are things that you can do that mean you can still enjoy them coming into your garden , bringing a sense of the countryside with them			0
