former @entity1 captain @entity0 has admitted he is still waiting for the ' penny to drop ' with under - pressure defensive trio @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5			1
@entity0 remains a passionate @entity1 fan despite his new career as @entity9 assistant manager and tv analyst for @entity11			1
the former @entity13 full back has claimed the current @entity1 defence lacks ' control ' but has attributed that to injury problems			1
@entity0 ( left , with @entity17 ) believes @entity1 defensive trio @entity5 , @entity4 and @entity3 still have work to do if they are to develop into reliable players at the highest level @entity0 still has great hopes the ' penny will drop ' and @entity5 will develop into a top - class player @entity4 in action during @entity1 's 2 - 0 win at @entity27 on saturday @entity3 has also struggled to find consistent form for @entity1 at times this season click here to read @entity32 editor @entity31 's interview with @entity0 meanwhile , he has revealed that @entity1 ’s three central defenders still have work to do if they are to develop in to proper players at the very highest level			1
@entity0 said : ' when you are with @entity9 and you work with the likes of @entity5 or @entity3 , you hope that a manager comes in and grabs them , plays them , trusts and puts belief in them			1
' so when @entity45 came in last season we thought that would be good news because @entity45 likes @entity50 players			2
' this season @entity52 has come in			1
a great coach and someone that worked all over @entity56			0
' he ’ll get them good on the ball , good defensively , in good positions to receive the ball , opening their body out and passing forward with composure			0
' for @entity64 it ’s perfect			2
the manager believes in attacking full backs and @entity64 is fantastic going forward			2
@entity64 is powerful , quick and hugely talented			2
then you want to get a grip on him and mould him into a world - class player			0
' then with the likes of @entity5 , @entity3 and @entity4 we still have great hopes for that penny to drop			1
@entity0 believes coach @entity52 is the perfect man to get the best out of his defensive players @entity64 could fit @entity78 's idea of an attacking full - back and could develop into a world class player @entity0 was a wonderful servant for @entity1 , playing in 602 matches over nearly two decades at @entity13 ' if you remember for many years we had players that potentially had it			1
@entity87 all of a sudden became the most important person in the team for a few seasons			0
it was like : ‘ wow , here we go , he ’s a player now ’			0
' @entity93 took two or three seasons and the penny dropped			0
people have got to remember the frustrating @entity93 to appreciate the great one			0
' @entity98 at @entity99 is another example			0
you lose a bit of patience at times but you know they have the talent inside them and you think they ’ve got the brain and willingness to do it			0
' they ’re still developing and picking up injuries but when they stop and the penny drops you think : " we ’ve lived with his faults , development and now we ’re getting the benefit of it			2
" ' there is no doubt that @entity3 , @entity5 and @entity64 have talent but they need experience , maturity and injuries to stay clear and they will fly			1
' @entity0 cites the example of midfielder @entity87 , who grew into one of @entity1 's indispensable players @entity0 also praised @entity99 midfielder @entity98 ( right ) as a player who has reached his potential @entity0 made his comments in a wide - ranging interview with the @entity32 fanzine and website			1
united fans will be interested to hear that he still has hopes for @entity4 , @entity3 and @entity5 , who have been criticised at times this season as part of @entity1 ’s much - discussed back three			1
@entity3 is only 22 but @entity5 is 25 and @entity4 27 which does make some people wonder how long @entity78 will have to wait for them to reach the potential @entity0 talks about			1
@entity0 added : ' when i look at the @entity1 defence what it lacks is control			1
' i see players that have talent but they ’re all individually working , not having controlled movements together or in - sync			0
that comes through understanding and from playing together			0
' no manager , whether it ’s sir @entity156 or someone else , over the past three years , would be able to put a consistent defence out there			0
' @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity3 , @entity5 and @entity4 all had injuries			1
now @entity163 , @entity164 get injured			0
i do n’t care which manager you are			0
@entity167 celebrates scoring @entity1 's opening goal at @entity27 with @entity169 young striker @entity170 sealed @entity1 's win at @entity172 with a goal in stoppage time @entity1 are currently fourth in the @entity176 table , 12 points behind the leaders @entity179 ' the reason that @entity179 have the best back four in the league is because they have good players , they play every week without many injuries			1
' @entity1 have been absolutely blitzed with injuries in those positions for the last three years			1
' at times they look all out at sea but you have to say in @entity52 ’s defence , he has had @entity87 in defence , @entity193 in defence with @entity169 and @entity195 as wing backs that have done well			1
' but if you said last season that @entity52 ’s going to come in and @entity195 is going to be a left back , you ’d start laughing			1
you ’d laugh your head off but he ’s been fantastic			0
' there has been so many changing formations , systems and personel that it ’s so difficult to get that sense of control in - between the units			2
that ’s all it lacks			0
' @entity169 evades a challenge from @entity27 's @entity210 during saturday 's match in @entity212 @entity195 has enjoyed a renaissance as an attacking full back under @entity78 this season asked elsewhere in the interview which are his three favourite @entity1 players , @entity0 mentions @entity217 and @entity218 but is unstinting in his praise of @entity193			1
he added : ' i love @entity193			2
i have respect for @entity193			2
' you never hear anyone that ’s played with @entity193 at @entity1 have a bad word to say about him			1
' ultimate professional , understanding and loves the club by the way			0
' do n’t get bought into this : ‘ @entity193 does n’t show passion ’ and all that crap			2
' you see him on a team night out when we won the league and he can be the loudest of the lot			0
' so , the idea that @entity193 just comes in as a bit of a mouse that does his job unnoticeably is rubbish			2
' if you look at @entity52 at the start of the season and we were struggling , ask yourself who was n’t playing ? @entity193 was n’t playing			1
@entity0 rates @entity193 as one of his favourite members of the @entity1 squad @entity193 fights for the ball with @entity253 of @entity27 during saturday 's match ' now he ’s playing and the club went on a great unbeaten run			1
i think he would be first or second on @entity52 ’s team - sheet because he brings control and authority			1
' @entity1 fans get it			2
i wanted @entity262 and someone to run through brick walls and coming out with bandages wrapped around his head			0
that ’s what @entity1 fans want			0
' but then when you play with @entity193 you think there is authority , control , peace			2
' when you are on a football pitch playing against @entity275 or @entity276 , you need peace around you as well			0
' you sometimes do n’t want people running around like blue - arse flies			0
' @entity280 and @entity193 together was peaceful			0
it was like going into a bar and hearing a piano playing			0
' listening to some good rock is good and you like that too but sometimes it ’s nice to listen to a piano			0
' @entity0 says @entity193 and @entity280 ( pictured ) together was like listening to a piano			1
