by @entity1 reporter last updated at 9:39 pm on 23rd september 2011 @entity3 president @entity2 says he has asked the @entity4 to admit the state of @entity6 as a full member			1
the move defies @entity10 - led international pressure on mr @entity2 to abandon such a bid			2
in response , @entity13 prime minister @entity12 said : ' i extend my hand to the @entity3 people , ' adding that he wanted a ' just and lasting peace ' with @entity6 however , mr @entity12 has opposed the bid for statehood at the @entity4 general assembly in @entity22			1
determined : @entity3 president @entity2 , left , and @entity13 's @entity12 both addressed the @entity23 in @entity22 today mr @entity2 is sidestepping nearly two decades of troubled negotiations in the hope this dramatic move on the world stage will re-energise @entity6 's quest for an independent homeland			1
he was greeted by sustained applause and appreciative whistles as he started to deliver a speech outlining his country 's aspiration of becoming a full member of the @entity4			2
however , some members of the @entity13 delegation , including foreign minister @entity38 , left the hall as @entity2 approached the podium			1
negotiations with @entity13 ' will be meaningless ' as long as it continues building on lands the @entity3 claim for their state , mr @entity2 declared , warning that his government could collapse if the construction persists			1
' this policy is responsible for the continued failure of the successive international attempts to salvage the peace process , ' said the president , who has refused to negotiate until the construction stops			2
' this settlement policy threatens to also undermine the structure of the @entity55 and even end its existence			0
' to another round of applause , he held up a copy of the formal membership application and said he had asked @entity4 chief @entity62 to speed up consideration of his request to have the @entity4 recognise a @entity3 state in the @entity66 , @entity67 and east @entity68			0
he concluded his speech by saying , ' we have one goal : to be			0
' president @entity72 and mr @entity2 are seen during a meeting in @entity22 on wednesday mr @entity2 ' jubilant mood was matched by the exuberant celebration of thousands of @entity3 who thronged around outdoor screens in town squares across the @entity66 on friday to see their president submit his historic request for recognition of a state of @entity6			1
' i am with the president , ' said @entity85 , a 36 - year - old physician , who brought his two children , ages 7 and 10 , to witness the moment			2
' after the failure of all other methods we reached a stage of desperation			0
' this is a good attempt to put the @entity3 cause and the @entity3 people on the map			0
everyone is here to stand behind the leadership			0
' @entity13 prime minister @entity12 , addressing the @entity23 shortly after @entity2 , said his country was ' willing to make painful compromises			1
' ' i extend my hand to the @entity3 people , with whom we seek a just and lasting peace , ' he said , to extended applause			0
palestinians , he added , ' should live in a free state of their own , but they should be ready for compromise ' and ' start taking @entity13 's security concerns seriously			1
' mr @entity12 offered to meet mr @entity2 in the @entity3 city of @entity114 , but added that he would be willing to meet for talks in @entity22 tonight			1
he said : ' who 's there to stop us ? what is there to stop us ? i 'll tell you my needs and concerns , you 'll tell me yours			2
and with @entity125 's help we 'll find the common ground of peace			2
' even if the @entity4 recognises @entity6 , there will be few immediate changes on the ground : @entity13 will continue to occupy the @entity66 and east @entity68 and to restrict access to @entity67 , ruled by @entity133 militants			1
@entity135 action on the membership request could take weeks or months			0
the strategy has put the @entity3 in direct confrontation with the @entity10 , which has threatened to veto their membership bid in the @entity135 , saying that statehood can only be achieved through direct negotiations between the parties to end the long and bloody conflict			1
' deeply confrontational ' : @entity145 has today cautioned against @entity3 statehood by seeking approval at a world forum overwhelmingly sympathetic to their quest , @entity3 hope to make it harder for @entity13 to resist global pressure to negotiate the borders of a future @entity6 based on lines @entity13 held before capturing the @entity66 , east @entity68 and @entity67 in 1967			1
the @entity10 and @entity13 have been pressuring council members to either vote against the plan or abstain when it comes up for a vote			2
the vote would require the support of nine of the @entity135 's 15 members to pass , but even if the @entity3 could secure that backing , the @entity10 says it will veto the move			0
the resumption of talks seems an elusive goal , with both sides digging in to positions that have tripped up negotiations for years			0
@entity13 has warned that the @entity3 appeal to the @entity4 will have a disastrous effect on negotiations			2
talks broke down nearly three years ago after @entity13 went to war in the @entity67			1
a last round was launched a year ago , but broke down just three weeks later			0
the @entity4 recognition bid has won mr @entity2 broad popular support at home , but it is opposed by his main political rival , the @entity182 militant @entity133 movement that wrested control of @entity67 in 2007			0
@entity67 's @entity133 prime minister , @entity184 , said : ' the @entity3 people do not beg the world for a state , and the state ca n't be created through decisions and initiatives			0
' @entity191 liberate their land first and then the political body can be established			0
' the plea came as former prime minister @entity145 warned that the move will be ' deeply confrontational ' without a return to peace talks with the @entity13			1
the former prime minister , now @entity199 representative for the international community , told @entity201 's @entity202 that @entity4 recognition would not change conditions on the ground in the @entity206			0
he stressed that he was not trying to block the application for @entity6 to be recognised as a state and said its leaders were ' entirely entitled to do so '			2
but he went on : ' you can pass whatever resolution you like at the @entity4 or the @entity135 , it does n't actually deliver you a state on the ground in the @entity66 and @entity67 , and if you do n't have a negotiation , whatever you do at the @entity4 is going to be deeply confrontational			1
' violence : a @entity3 holds a slingshot as others roll tires to burn during clashes with @entity13 soldiers , at the @entity224 checkpoint between the @entity66 city of @entity114 and @entity68 religious unrest : @entity3 demonstrators carry a slingshot and rocks past a burning rubbish bin during clashes with @entity13 soldiers today the issue has divided the international community , with @entity13 and the @entity10 strongly opposed and @entity234 trying to seek a compromise			2
deputy prime minister @entity236 has admitted to ' debates ' at the top of government about how @entity240 should respond			0
mr @entity145 , special envoy for the @entity10 , @entity4 , @entity241 and @entity242 , said he was working day and night to find a way of relaunching negotiations between @entity13 and the @entity3			1
he suggested mr @entity2 did not need the statehood recognition to hold talks with @entity13			1
' when you actually get down to the detail of territory , security , @entity68 , refugees , water , all the issues , to be absolutely frank about it , it does n't make a great deal of difference whether you are designating someone as a state or not a state , ' he said			0
' the @entity55 and president @entity2 are perfectly able to negotiate with the @entity13			1
' he added : ' with the changes going on in the region at the moment , there is a huge strategic interest on both sides to get a credible negotiation going again			0
' @entity10 president @entity72 has also pleaded with mr @entity2 to drop the application in case it causes further violence in the region .			0
