@entity0 went out that @entity2 's involvement in the regeneration of @entity4 would form the basis of her new tv series when @entity2 , self - styled queen of shops , announced that the rundown seaside town of @entity4 had been chosen to benefit from her retailing wisdom , many shopkeepers hoped the ailing resort ’s fortunes might be transformed			1
@entity0 went out that the tv presenter and retail guru also wanted to use her involvement as the basis for her new series			0
the intention was to show how @entity21 magic can turn an economically rundown town into a busy trading centre again			1
but as the initial sparkle of their involvement with a celebrity champion begins to fade , the good folk of @entity4 are increasingly worried that the initiative is more of a vehicle for @entity2 ’s ego — and for her bank balance — than for the rehabilitation of their once proud resort			1
it is a dispute that is threatening to split the @entity38 town			0
first , many accuse @entity21 of a sort of blackmail			2
for , in a provocative outburst , she seemed to suggest that unless they signed up to a long list of conditions ( such as making available their financial accounts and agreeing to themselves and their customers being filmed ) , the £ 100,000 worth of taxpayers ’ money that she was bringing via the project might be taken away			1
they also fear that like every other reality - style show , film footage might be used to ridicule them on national tv			1
indeed , some are asking whether @entity67 ’s ‘ @entity66 tsar ’ should really be allowed to promote her own tv career on the back of a government - funded scheme			1
@entity68 was chosen after @entity21 announced a nationwide competition in which 12 economically - disadvantaged towns would eventually each be awarded £ 100,000 of taxpayers ’ money to help breathe life into them			1
@entity68 was chosen after @entity21 announced a nationwide competition in which 12 economically disadvantaged towns would eventually each be awarded £ 100,000 of taxpayers ' money to help breathe life into them more than 300 towns signed up to be chosen as one of the dozen ‘ @entity2 ’			1
to understand how @entity68 is divided over the issue , it is necessary to explain how it has become two very different towns			0
on the @entity66 that rises up above the sandy beaches — once the choice holiday destination for millions of @entity86 — the traditional big - name chains have left			0
nearly 40 per cent of stores now lie empty as customers have been lured to the out - of - town @entity92 shopping mall and the nearby @entity94 ’s and @entity95 , all of which have free parking			0
meanwhile , the small , independents left on the @entity66 struggle to survive amid empty premises with boarded - up windows and to let signs			0
but while the @entity66 , with its charity shops and £ 1 bargain stores , epitomise recession - hit @entity107 , just down the @entity4 @entity108 is fashionable and chic , with boutique clothes shops , a thriving café culture , bistros and art galleries			0
on the @entity66 that rises up above the sandy beaches - once the choice holiday destination for millions of @entity86 - the traditional big - name chains have left nearly 40 per cent of stores now lie empty as customers have been lured to the out - of - town @entity92 shopping mall ( above ) and the nearby @entity94 's and @entity95 , all of which have free parking last year , @entity2 , 52 , having been asked by prime minister @entity67 to lead an independent review into the future of the @entity66 , reported that an average 20 high street shops a day were closing across the country			1
it was a stark assessment that illustrated how out - of - town shopping centres and online retailers were dramatically changing the face of @entity107 towns			2
excited by the prospect of winning £ 100,000 of government money to reinvigorate their town , the people of @entity4 drew up imaginative proposals			1
in may , after months of hard work , @entity68 was named as one of the 12 winning towns			0
@entity2 visited and joined a packed public meeting in the former @entity139 building			2
she told the audience that she would base her next @entity142 series , @entity2 : queen of the @entity66 , on their story			2
but though she added , ‘ this is not about me — this is about @entity68 ’ , the idea worried many locals			1
and their fears only increased when she said : ‘ the downside for some of you is that i ’ve got cameras doing this with me			2
they show warts and all			0
this ai n’t going to be smooth			0
’ the seafront at @entity4 , bustling with activity in 1954 then , in a phrase that many shop - keepers considered to be blackmail , @entity2 added : ‘ so we either let the cameras in with me , or i go back on the train and some other town gets it ( the money )			1
’ @entity2 later admitted her brusque manner was a mistake , and when she made the inflammatory comment it was ‘ heat of the moment stuff with a camera stuck in my face ’			1
in fact , the money was awarded by the government and was not conditional on any tv deal			2
however , worse was to come , and within days two producers from @entity179 — a tv production company — were trying to get townsfolk to sign contracts so they could appear in @entity21 ’s new tv series			1
they were told they had to declare any psychological or physical problems that could affect filming , that they must make available all their firm ’s financial records , and that they would be legally banned from discussing the programme publicly			0
shop staff and customers would also have to make themselves freely available to be filmed			0
there was also anger about how much @entity2 would make from the series , compared with the shopkeepers ’ derisory appearance fee of £ 1 each			1
@entity2 ( right ) with a @entity4 shopkeeper			2
she met with high street businesses , local shoppers and the council on her visit the @entity203 has a two - year £ 500,000 contract with @entity142 , and will be paid a fee of about £ 45,000 for the three @entity4 programmes			0
while some boutique stores in the @entity108 are displaying posters declaring their love for mrs @entity2 — though they wo n’t benefit from the £ 100,000 , they hope they might benefit from the publicity — a very different poster was displayed on the @entity66 , showing the grinning face of @entity21 with the words : ‘ thanks people of @entity4 , because i ’m earning £ 46,000			1
’ in the family - run @entity218 opposite , @entity216 , 70 , is as straight - talking as @entity2 : ‘ a media luvvie from the tv company came in with a contract			1
i thought it was outrageous and very intrusive			0
we refuse to appear because we would inevitably have ended up being ridiculed			0
not for us , thank you ! ’ @entity226 , 55 , of @entity227 , is still angry about @entity2 ’s ‘ insensitive ’ comments that she ’d leave @entity4 unless tv cameras were allowed			1
‘ that was terrible , ’ he says			2
he says it does n’t need a tv celebrity to divine @entity68 ’s problems : rising business rates , high street parking charges and the lure of shops such as @entity237 and @entity238 at the @entity92 mall			0
some are asking whether @entity67 's ' @entity66 tsar ' should really be allowed to promote her own tv career on the back of a government - funded scheme ‘ i ’ve been here 22 years and i ’m close to shutting up shop , ’ he says			1
‘ i do n’t see what £ 100,000 will do to help			1
also , i ’m worried that a reality tv show will simply ridicule us			2
’ another shopkeeper tore up his contract with the tv firm when he was told he had to provide detailed information about his private life			2
some shopkeepers have also expressed irritation that many new shops have signed up to the tv series even though they are not part of the £ 100,000 regeneration scheme			1
the spit - and - sawdust - style @entity262 pub in the @entity108 refuses to embrace the trendy ways characterising most of the neighbourhood			0
landlady @entity267 does n’t mince her words			0
‘ this whole thing is about helping @entity2 ’s tv career , ’ she says , pulling a pint for a man covered in tattoos			1
@entity274 has personal experience of the @entity21 treatment after she visited his successful outside @entity277			2
‘ she just walked in unannounced , ’ he says			2
‘ suddenly this red - haired woman arrived with her entourage of about 30 people and a tv crew			2
i did n’t know who she was			0
‘ i did n’t want so many people cramming into my gallery , so i said : “ excuse me , could you leave ? ” they said they only wanted to ask me some questions			0
i said : “ leave ! ” ’ @entity289 , 39 , who owns madam @entity291 clothing , has signed up to appear in the series but admits the producers warned her that mrs @entity2 can sometimes come across as a bit abrupt			1
‘ they said if she was too harsh with her constructive criticism of the shop , i should tell the production crew , ’ she says			0
‘ it will hurt , but it could be invaluable			0
’ a @entity142 spokesman said @entity179 had enjoyed ‘ positive feedback ’ from shopkeepers , adding that contracts are being amended after people raised concerns			0
‘ @entity68 decides that it wants to take part in the tv series wo n’t in any way affect the work @entity312 is doing with the government and 12 @entity315 towns , ’ it said			1
‘ @entity312 is passionate about her work to help reinvigorate the @entity66 , and the programme will be made in that spirit			0
’ back on @entity322 , @entity319 , 75 - year - old owner of @entity320 , an electrical and camera shop , says : ‘ it ’s very sad , the decline of the @entity66			1
it means the decline of a community			0
‘ @entity2 says she wants to introduce market stallholders — but how will that have any effect on things such as soaring rates or parking costs ? ‘ i may be cynical , but i fear this government initiative is all helping her tv show and her career			1
there ’s no proof to show that it will help towns such as @entity68			0

locals fear that if they do not sign up to long list of conditions , £ 100,000 worth of taxpayers ’ money she was bringing might be taken away
@entity21 : ‘ we either let the cameras in with me , or i go back on the train and some other town gets it ( the money ) ’
also concern film footage will be used to ridicule *residents* on national tv
