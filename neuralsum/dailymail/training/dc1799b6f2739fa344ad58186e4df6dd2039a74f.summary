today @entity0 is a cold and barren desert world , with no apparent sign of life			2
but four billion years ago , scientists believe the red planet was a very different place - one that the believe looked a lot like @entity8			0
a stunning video by @entity11 ’s @entity10 reveals what @entity0 may have looked like if its atmosphere allowed for water			2
‘ there are characteristic dendritic structured channels that , like on @entity8 , are consistent with surface erosion by water flows , ’ said dr @entity24 of the @entity25			0
the interiors of some impact craters , for instance , have patterns that suggest crater lakes , with many showing connecting channels consistent with water flows into the crater			0
‘ small impact craters have been removed with time and larger craters show signs of erosion by water before 3.7 billion years ago , ’ added dr @entity24			0
the crater formed long after the most recent proposed ice age on @entity0 , which ended some 400,000 years ago			2
this is an artist 's impression of what a lake on @entity0 may have looked like the video was created ahead of @entity11 's @entity52 ( @entity52 ) mission which will investigate dramatic climate change on @entity0			1
the @entity52 mission is due to launch on monday november 18 and will arrive at @entity0 in september 2014			1
it will take critical measurements of the @entity0 upper atmosphere to help scientists understand climate change over the red planet 's history			1
specifically , it will investigate how the loss of @entity0 ' atmosphere to space determined the history of water on the surface			0
‘ minerals are present on the surface that can only be produced in the presence of liquid water , for example , in hematite and clays			0
’ estimates of the amount of water needed to explain these features suggest as much as a planet - wide layer one - half a kilometre ( 1,640 feet ) deep of liquid			0
if liquid surface water existed in the past , then @entity0 ' atmosphere had to have a different climate that was warmer			2
in the video , rapidly moving clouds are used to suggest the passage of time , and the shift from a warm and wet to a cold and dry climate is shown as the video progresses			1
the lakes dry up and freeze over , while the atmosphere changes from @entity8 - like blue skies to the pink and tan colours seen on @entity0 today			1
it 's unknown if the habitable climate lasted long enough for life to emerge on @entity0			2
‘ the only direct evidence for life early in the history of a planet 's evolution is that on @entity8 , ’ said dr @entity24			0
@entity11 said the video is one of the most complex animations ever produced by its @entity10 , located at @entity111			0
liquid water can not exist pervasively on the @entity113 today due to the low atmospheric pressure and surface temperature in the video , rapidly moving clouds are used to suggest the passage of time , and the shift from a warm and wet to a cold and dry climate is shown as the video progresses ‘ we used a wide @entity124 aspect ratio to better showcase the landscape			1
all this stuff wreaks havoc on the computer system in terms of trying to figure out how to render it , ’ said @entity118 of @entity119 , lead animator on the project			0
the video ends with an illustration of the @entity52 mission in orbit around present - day @entity0			1
@entity52 , scheduled to launch on monday , will investigate how @entity0 lost its atmosphere and will arrive at @entity0 in september 2014			1

video shows shift from a warm and wet climate to one that is cold and dry
the lakes dry up and freeze over , while the *sky* changes from blue to pink
it was created ahead of @entity52 's investigation into climate change on @entity0
@entity52 will launch on monday and will arrive on @entity0 in september 2014
