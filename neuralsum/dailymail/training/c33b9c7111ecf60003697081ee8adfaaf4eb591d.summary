it is an internet forum where parents can share advice on subjects such as potty training and the spiralling cost of childcare			1
but @entity7 has also attracted thousands of posts on risqué topics , as women members clamour to share details of their explicit bedroom antics			1
the website – popular with middle - class mothers – risks undermining its wholesome image because many users seem preoccupied with @entity18 chatter			1
a team of moderators delete the most obscene messages , but unless users report a comment , it remains on the site			1
yesterday , new threads included ‘ ever s * * * * * * anyone famous ? ’ and ‘ i had a dream last night			1
i ’m blushing about it ’ , which involved a threesome with two men			2
the day before , users mused over questions such as ‘ what is the sexiest thing you have ever had whispered in your ear ? ’ the website features conversations among women about everything from fivesomes and sex toys to rape fantasies and a bikini wax that became too hands - on			2
the racy banter risks driving away mothers who visit the site to discuss topics such as health , politics and parenting			1
several have already expressed their boredom at the incessant chatter about people ’s sex lives			2
forum boards : ' do you dunk your penis ' got an array of responses and sparked a flurry of debate on @entity64 when one user , known as @entity74 ’s @entity73 , wrote of her husband ’s unorthodox suggestion to spice up their sex life , a wearied mother wrote : ‘ @entity80 , yawn			2
but cindy … there ’s one of these threads at least once a week … they are tres boring … and who really gives a * * * * about your sex life ? ’			2
members are also often scolded by fellow users for providing ‘ tmi ’ – too much information – in the discussions about sex			0
in one post , a woman revealed that her husband ‘ took @entity90 for the first time last night ’ , describing what happened next in such graphic detail that one user responded , ‘ eyes watering ’			0
a thread about ‘ weird sexual fantasies now you are pregnant ’ also prompted admissions of bondage and fantasies about boy band @entity103			0
on @entity7 : ' a box of tissues , a small bin , and a beaker of clean water for temporary cleaning / dunking ' [ image posed by model ] men have also turned to the site to seek advice on everything from a wife ’s porn addiction to her unwillingness to try new things in the bedroom			1
even discussions about education took a steamy turn , with one user suggesting she would have to seduce education secretary @entity123 wearing a mortar board and on a desk covered with copies of the national curriculum in order to secure his prompt resignation			0
she said she would then sell her story , and ‘ he resigns , job done ’			0
‘ i mean , i would be doing it for the kids , ’ she added			0
the website was set up in 2000 by friends @entity7 and @entity137 and now boasts 50million page views a month and an annual turnover of £ 4 million			1
mrs @entity137 , chief executive , said : ‘ happily , it seems some mothers do still have time and energy for their sex lives and we ’ve always been pleased to provide a go - to destination for straight answers			0
‘ people ’s sex lives come up occasionally but those threads are rarely reported			0
‘ it seems that mothers on the whole think that sex is a normal part of life			0
