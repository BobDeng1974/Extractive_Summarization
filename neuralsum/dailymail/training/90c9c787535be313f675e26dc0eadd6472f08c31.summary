during his investigation he found that there are two rounds of frying			1
he also discovered that dimethylpolysiloxane - a form of silicone found in @entity21 - is used in the making of @entity7 's fries along with a petrol - based chemical called tertiary butylhydroquinone ( @entity26 )			1
@entity37 , which @entity38 struggles to pronounce , is added for safety reasons to prevent cooking oil from foaming			0
while tertiary butylhydroquinone ( @entity26 ) is applied as a food preservative			1
@entity3 explains that there are numerous steps involved in the creation of @entity7 's fries			1

they 're then fired through a cutter at up to 70 miles an hour into thin sticks			0
after being chiseled into the perfect shape , the strips of potato are sauced with a blend of canola oil , soybean oil , hydrongenated soybean oil , natural beef flavor , hydrolyzed wheat , hydrolyzed milk , citric acid and dimethylpolysiloxane			1
raw product : first potatoes are harvested from fields before being peeled , cut and blanched multi-step process : here they are seen on a conveyor belt at the factory in @entity11 getting the right shape : the washed potatoes are then fired through a cutter at up to 70 miles an hour into thin sticks - here @entity38 holds up the fry slicer dextrose - a natural sugar - is sprayed on the batons to help them maintain a golden fried color			1
sodium acid pyrophosphate is also added to prevent the fries from going grey			1
last but not least , salt is sprinkled on for flavor			0
the fries are then flash frozen at the @entity86 factory and transported to @entity7 's outlets across the country			1
once they are at restaurants , the potato sticks are fried for a second time			1
the oil blend is similar to the factory mix , with the addition of tertiary butylhydroquinone and hydrogenated soybean oil - a manufactured form of trans fat			1
and voila ! @entity7 's @entity99 are served			1
finishing touches : after they are sliced the potato sticks are sauced in an oil blend , coated in dextrose to maintain their golden fried color and sprinkled with salt almost there : the fries are flash frozen before being shipped to restaurants where they are fried for a second time - they are not vegetarian or gluten free your meal is served : a large serving of the finished product contains 510 calories , 6gms of protein , 24gms of fat , 67gms of carbs and 290mgs of sodium a large serving of the finished product contains 510 calories , 6gms of protein , 24gms of fat , 67gms of carbs and 290mgms of sodium			1
