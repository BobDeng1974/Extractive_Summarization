by @entity0 published : 08:18 est , 2 october 2013 updated : 09:16 est , 2 october 2013 newly discovered fossils hint that flowers could have bloomed at a time when the first dinosaurs walked the @entity7 , @entity2 scientists have said			0
the discovery dates seed - producing and flowering plants - known as angiosperms - to around 100 million years earlier than palaeontologists previously thought			1
angiosperms became the dominant plants some 90 million years ago , when dinosaurs were still very much alive , but scientists were not sure exactly when the plants originated			1
scientists have unearthed 245 - million - year - old pollen grains ( examples shown here ) , with tiny features typically that are seen in flowering plants , from samples taken in @entity2 today 's flowering plants evolved from relative of seed - producing plants that did not flower , including conifers and cycads			1
@entity30 , a paleobotanist at the @entity32 's @entity31 , told @entity33 that flowering plants were the final group of plants to evolve in @entity7 's history			2
' they are an extremely successful group on which all terrestrial ecosystems today depend , including the existence of humanity , ' he said			0
scientists have discovered ancient pollen grains with features that are usually seen in flowering plants			1
the 245 - million - year - old fossils were found in two samples taken from northern @entity2 and are approximately the same age as the earliest known dinosaur in the middle triassic period			1
newly discovered fossils hint that flowers could have bloomed at a time when the first dinosaurs , such as @entity55 ( illustrated ) walked the @entity7 , @entity2 scientists said pollen grains are robust and plentiful , which makes then easier to spot in fossil records than fragile leaves and flowers			2
an unrelated fossil of buttercups ( left ) and early aquatic angiosperm ( right ) is pictured dr @entity30 said : ' our findings suggest that the origin of flowering plants is rooted much deeper than originally thought			1
' pollen grains are robust and plentiful , which makes then easier to spot in the fossil record than fragile leaves and flowers , he said			0
the researchers analysed the structure of these grains to publish their study in the journal frontiers in @entity75 and believe they were pollinated by beetles , as bees did not evolve until around 100 million years later			2
the fossils yielded six different kinds of pollen , hinting that ancient flowers were diverse , while scientists said they have seen similar grains in @entity2 and the @entity84 , located north of @entity86			2
in the @entity88 , both the regions were located in the subtropics but modern @entity2 was much drier than its more northern counterpart , suggesting the plants adapted to different environments			0
while the fossil record of angiosperms dates back 140 million years , even @entity93 was unsure when they first originated - calling it an ' abominable mystery '			1
now , the plot thickens as the fossils demonstrate that the flowering plants were in existence 100 million years sooner than imagined , although the longer period of time might explain how they came to diversity and spread in the age of the dinosaurs			1
however , the fossils do not shed any more light on the ancestors of angiosperms , which have baffled scientists who are unsure how they came to exist			0
dr @entity30 said no direct ancestors of angiosperms have been identified			0
' some groups of plants are suspected to be closely related			0
but the evidence is weak and most of these groups are thought to be too specialised to be at the base of the flowering plants , ' he said .			0

flowering plants became dominant 90 million years ago but until now scientists were unsure when plants , known as angiosperms , originated
@entity32 researchers found ancient pollen grains with features that are usually seen in flowering plants in 245 - million - year - old fossils
their findings suggest the origin of flowering plants is rooted much deeper than originally thought
