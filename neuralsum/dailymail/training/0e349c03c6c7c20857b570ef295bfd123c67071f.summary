by @entity1 reporter published : 07:31 est , 13 september 2013 updated : 08:06 est , 13 september 2013 a coastal village can now boast a new attraction - the country 's smallest parking space			2
the tiny gap in between two sets of double yellow lines measures in at just nine inches wide , just big enough to fit the wheels of a bicycle			1
residents of @entity13 , @entity11 have now gone to town with the gaffe - mocking officials who left the space by parking toy cars in the spot			1
tiny : locals in @entity13 , @entity20 have been left baffled by the tiny parking space , which measures in at just nine inches wide bus tour manager @entity23 , who first noticed the gap two weeks ago , said : ' i could nâ€™t believe my eyes when i spotted it			1
you could just about fit a bike in there sideways - or maybe a pogo stick			0
' the 72 - year - old added : ' but my favourite thing was to put a toy bus in there just to have a laugh at it			2
' however , @entity39 bosses have revealed there is a real reason why workmen did n't fill in the space			1
fun : residents in the village have mocked council bosses over the bureaucratic blunder by parking a toy truck in the miniscule gap one set of yellow lines are on a public road owned by the local authority , while the others are on a private road which leads to the local gp surgery			1
a spokesman explained : ' the section of double yellow lines leading to the surgery is on a private access road and the council would not have undertaken this work			0
' it is likely the surgery would have arranged for the yellow markings to restrict parking on the access road			0
' the break in the lines is required as this shows the termination of the traffic order on the public road			0
' @entity76 bosses have defended the move , insisting the yellow lines belong to both public and private roads but villager @entity80 , who cheekily parked the plastic truck in the spot , has branded the explanation ' nonsense '			2
he said : ' we all think it makes a lot more sense to have joined - up thinking - and joined up yellow lines			0
it really is bureaucratic nonsense			0
