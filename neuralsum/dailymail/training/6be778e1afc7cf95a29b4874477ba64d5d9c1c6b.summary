firms bidding for government contracts will have to offer higher wages to their lowest - paid staff under @entity5 plans			2
@entity6 is expected to announce at @entity5 ’s conference next week that firms seeking government work will have to pay the so - called ‘ living wage ’ , which is more than £ 1 an hour higher than the national minimum wage			1
the move is the centrepiece of a package which will also see significant increases in the minimum wage , and a new formula to prevent it falling behind inflation			1
@entity6 is expected to announce at @entity5 ’s conference next week that firms seeking government work will have to pay the ‘ living wage ’ shadow work and pensions secretary @entity21 last night said some employers were already paying the living wage			1
she said : ‘ i want to use those examples of best practice in the public and private sectors to determine how a future @entity27 would act , and that would mean over time having public sector procurement requiring paying a living wage			1
‘ that ’s something we ’re looking at for the manifesto			0
and it ’s something that @entity6 feels very strongly about			2
’ the national minimum wage stands at £ 6.50 an hour			1
the living wage is significantly higher at £ 7.65 an hour , up to £ 8.80 in @entity37			1
senior @entity5 figures have been trying to drum up business support for a big increase in the minimum wage ahead of next week ’s conference in @entity43			1
mr @entity6 ’s adviser on the issue , @entity44 , has launched a discreet bid to persuade business leaders to sign an open letter backing the idea			2
the letter says that ‘ as the economy recovers , we believe the minimum wage should rise faster than it has in the recent past			1
a stronger minimum wage will benefit businesses , improve public finances and help tackle low pay ’			2
it makes no mention of a specific figure , but @entity5 is thought to be considering boosting the minimum wage to £ 7 an hour			1
shadow work and pensions secretary @entity21 last night said some employers were already paying the living wage miss @entity21 told @entity63 : ‘ i do think there ’s scope for increasing the value of the national minimum wage			1
i think it ’s fallen in real terms by 5 per cent since the last general election			0
i would like to see at least that value restored			0
’ miss @entity21 also sought to toughen @entity5 ’s rhetoric on the issue of migrants claiming benefits , saying decisions on benefits should be set by @entity77 , not @entity78			2
she said : ‘ i do n’t think it ’s right that someone should be able to come to this country and be able to start claiming benefits on day one			0
or that they should be able to claim child benefit for children living overseas			0
’ ‘ all countries in the @entity87 have their own welfare states and welfare is supposed to be an issue of national sovereignty , so we should be able to make decisions about how our welfare state works			0
’ @entity95 mp @entity94 , a member of the commons business select committee , said politicians should be ‘ very wary ’ of imposing big wage increases on employers			0
mr @entity94 said : ‘ they need to be very careful about this , and think about the impact on jobs			0
most small business i know want to pay people the best wage they can because it is the best way to keep good people			0
but ultimately they can only pay what they can afford			0
‘ i would also be worried that a move of this kind could make it harder for small firms to win @entity27 contracts at a time when we want more of them involved			0

@entity6 is expected to announce the changes at conference next week
the living wage is £ 7.65 an hour and up to £ 8.80 an hour in @entity37
