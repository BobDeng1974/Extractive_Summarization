pronounced dom - in - eeka , and not to be confused with the @entity1 , @entity0 is promoted as the ' nature island '			1
its volcanic peaks reach above 4,700ft - and with its valleys and gorges , rainforest and the cloud forest above , the island is extraordinarily beautiful			1
its lushness is on account of it being the wettest island in the @entity15 , with more than 275 inches of rain falling a year in the interior — though this figure is far smaller on the coast			1
sailboats and serenity : scenes from the @entity24 movies have been filmed on @entity0 it has 365 rivers , one for every day of the year ; and even in the drier season its waterfalls are magnificent			1
we were entranced by this compact @entity29 , and found it hard to believe that so much of what you see today has grown up or been rebuilt since 1979 when @entity33 stripped the coastal hillsides , decapitated trees in the central highlands and devastated homes and businesses			0
we based ourselves first at @entity39 , a delightfully civilised and comfortable small hotel overlooking the rugged @entity41 coast			0
owner - manager , @entity42 , who grew up on a farm near @entity44 and later travelled widely , fell in love with @entity0 and opened for business more than ten years ago			1
delightfully deserted : the beaches in the north - east of the island , around @entity50 , are simply splendid he is now building a retirement home in an even more lovely location - now there 's an idea			1
@entity0 is one of the few islands that still has descendants of the indigenous @entity59 ( @entity59 ) people , and you can visit a modest re-creation of a @entity59 settlement			1
we followed that with an easy stroll along @entity66			0
no one should go to @entity0 without doing at least one hike that also involves swimming in a river or pool			1
the @entity71 stretches for 115 miles along its winding route from the top to the bottom of the island , passing through the @entity76 , a @entity77			0
there are helpful classifications of the various hikes in tourist literature and the indispensable @entity82 , which grades them by length , elevation , terrain and river crossings			0
signposted timings are sometimes given , though in our experience they proved optimistic			0
easy come , easy go : @entity93 , on the east coast of @entity0 , sums up the island 's quiet charm my wife and i , who are freedom - pass - age holiday hikers , found the well - trodden hike to the dramatic @entity100 enchanting and manageable			1
on another , more arduous , one to @entity103 from the east coast , there was the added entertainment of an encounter with a group of furtive @entity108 skipping through the forest with trays of marijuana plants to be replanted somewhere discreet			0
of the more challenging , longer hikes , the best known is the one across the hot streams and bubbling mud of the @entity115 to the steaming and simmering @entity117			0
it is clearly quite something to experience			0
the rainforest is always dripping and when it rains it is no less enjoyable - though cooler and slippier			1
sensible shoes that can wade through rivers are a must and , unless you are a confident hiker , take a guide			0
both the guides organised by our hotels were great fun , extremely knowledgeable and supportive when we were having a bit of difficulty ; one of them , the wonderfully deep - voiced @entity132 , had recently been guide to a @entity136 team exploring the highest parts of the @entity76			1
sunday best : the island gained its name because @entity140 ' discovered ' it on a sunday ( @entity141 ) for thrill - seekers , there is river tubing or more adventurous river canyoning or whale - watching ( 90 per cent chance of seeing a whale , according to @entity132 )			2
in the north - east , around @entity50 , are beaches to rival the most beautiful and unspoilt in the @entity15 , with added stardust - they were used for filming @entity24			1
on the calmer west coast , we greatly enjoyed our couple of hours in lively @entity153 , the capital , and in its small museum were intrigued to discover that in the 1890s limes replaced sugar as the main export crop , with much supplied to @entity160 for the production of @entity162			0
@entity0 care greatly about their natural heritage and their country 's politics			2
debate can become as hot as @entity117 , with issues ranging from the selling of citizenship and the influence of the @entity171 to the state of the roads			0
their independence of spirit is matched by the independent - minded travellers @entity0 attracts			1
stormy skies , bright horizons : a dark afternoon only amplifies the prettiness of the west - coast capital @entity153 most accommodation is modest , though ' resort ' hotels such as @entity184 and @entity185 offer more in the way of facilities , and for those with deep pockets , there is the exclusive @entity191			0
after @entity39 we stayed in one of the island 's longest - established hotels , the charming and simple @entity196			2
@entity197 is an @entity198 who came to @entity0 in the early 60s			2
she and @entity1 husband @entity200 have created an exotic garden which attracts visitors who come to see the nearby @entity203			2
@entity204 stayed here when he visited @entity0 a few years ago ( room 12 if you want to sleep in the same large and comfortable bed )			1
that not many people recognised him , nor paid him special attention when he was there , just goes to show what an unspoilt , unpretentious place @entity0 is			2
@entity214 ( 0207 6661234 , www.westernoriental.com ) has seven nights ' b&b at @entity218 hotel from £ 1,095pp , including return flights and private transfers			0
for more information on tourism in @entity0 , see www.dominica.dm .			2

little island @entity0 should not be confused with the @entity1
it is a slice of the @entity15 at its least developed , largely clad in rainforest
@entity204 recently chose the island for a get - away - from - it - all holiday
