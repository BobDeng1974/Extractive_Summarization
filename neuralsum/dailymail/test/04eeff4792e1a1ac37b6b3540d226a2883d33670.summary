new figures revealed at least 112,000 motorists were given fines or appeared in court for motorway offences last year – a quarter more than in the previous year			2
the increase has been put down to the introduction of ‘ smart motorways ’ which use the cameras , known as @entity18 , to police speed limits which are varied according to the driving conditions			1

’ nearly 113,000 drivers were handed speeding penalties last year according to @entity83 statistics provided by 24 out of 45 police forces compared to close to 89,000 in 2013 and almost 55,000 in 2010			0
