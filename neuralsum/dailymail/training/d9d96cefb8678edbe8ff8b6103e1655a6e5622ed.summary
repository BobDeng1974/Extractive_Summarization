by @entity0 a record number of starfish are dying as a result of a disease which wastes away their arms and turns them into ' goo '			1
the sea creatures are falling victim to the mystery condition which causes white lesions to grow along their limbs , before they disintegrate			1
it has wiped out 95 per cent of the animals in some tide pools along the @entity16 of @entity17 and scientists are struggling to find a way to stop the spike in deaths , because they do not know what is causing the deadly epidemic			1
he swam along the water bed , analysing the disintegrated sea stars , before filming their wasting bodies and posting the video on @entity39			2
dead starfish , with missing arms , have since turned up along the coast of the @entity17 from @entity43 down to @entity44 , and scientists believe sea creatures as far south as @entity47 could be at risk			1
@entity49 , chairman of the @entity50 at the @entity51 , told @entity52 : ' what 's happening ? we do n't know yet			2
we think it 's bacterial			0
' we also know that it can move between species			0
they get a wound and the bacteria will just kind of eat the species away			0
' in the past , researchers have linked sea star wasting disease outbreaks to rising ocean temperatures			1
decapitated : the condition causes the sea creatures to look as though their limbs have been chopped off the largest number of deaths occurred along the coast of @entity44 from 1983 - 1984 , during an @entity71 year , where the temperature of the @entity73 increases			1
' we 're not having an @entity71 year this year			0
that 's what 's really troublesome about this , ' @entity49 added			0
until researchers can properly map the outbreak , mr @entity49 added , it will be difficult to determine the cause , or an underlying link between the regional outbreaks			2
so far , the disease has killed 95 percent of certain species in some tide pools			2
the overall population numbers in the millions , but mr @entity89 said it was troubling to see such a large percentage die off in an individual tide pool			0
expansion : there has been an infestation of jellyfish in oceans around the world causing an increase in the number of people being stung on holiday as sea stars die out , many ecosystems of other animals will also be affected with the population of creatures like mussels expanding			1
now marine biologists are trying to find out the root causes of the mystery disease , so researchers can start to determine how to control the outbreak			1
while star fish are decreasing in numbers , scientists around the world are reporting a boom in the number of jellyfish , resulting in more tourists being stung while on holiday			2
in @entity125 there it has been reported that between 800 or 1,000 people have been stung in a day , while in @entity127 or @entity128 , up to half a million people have been affected during a spike in the population			0
the massive increase in numbers has reportedly caused the deaths of thousands of farmed salmon in @entity136 and caused a nuclear plant in @entity138 to temporarily shut down			0
dr. @entity139 , who has recently written a book on jellyfish blooms , told @entity142 the increasing activity was because of overfishing and changing water temperatures .			0

condition makes sea creatures look like their limbs have been chopped off
white lesions develop and spread over their arms before they disintegrate
has wiped out 95 per cent of the animals off parts of the @entity16
scientists and researchers are not sure what is causing the mystery
