it was fright night for @entity2 in @entity3 as minnows @entity4 stunned the @entity6 holders with a goal after six minutes and then made @entity9 ’s team toil for a hard - fought win			1
@entity11 missed one penalty and scored another , moving him to 69 @entity6 goals – just two short of @entity16 ’s record – but wednesday was not a night for @entity2 milestones , more of narrowly avoiding embarrassment			1
they started slowly , defended badly and former @entity21 striker @entity20 almost completed the horror show with an awful second - half miss with the score still at 1 - 1			0
he was replaced by @entity25 , who scored what was to be @entity2 ’s winner			2
@entity25 celebrates scoring the winner for @entity2 against @entity4 no more than 10 minutes after coming off the bench @entity25 's slick finish saved @entity2 from an embarrassing journey home from @entity32 @entity4 : @entity33 ; @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity35 , @entity38 , @entity39 ( @entity40 70 ) , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 subs not used : @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 goal : @entity39 7 booked : @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity41 , @entity42 @entity2 : @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 ( @entity25 67 ) , @entity11 subs not used : @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 goals : @entity11 24 ( pen ) , @entity25 77 booked : @entity55 it was the @entity3 team ’s first home game in the @entity6 , and they were n’t even ‘ properly ’ at home			1
with @entity76 regulations meaning the club could not use its tiny 6,100 - capacity @entity78 , they had had to make the 324km journey to @entity32 to play the game in @entity3 ’s national stadium			0
around 5,000 of their home town @entity84 ’s 33,000 population had made the five - hour road trip to watch their team and they were given a night they will never forget			0
@entity2 were behind inside just six minutes when they failed to defend a corner			2
@entity55 and @entity57 were beaten at the near post and @entity39 ghosted in at the back post ahead of a static @entity53 to head in the flick on			0
@entity2 had the chance to equalise almost immediately but @entity11 failed to convert a penalty			1
@entity20 went down in the box and the @entity99 superstar stepped up with a customary well - struck spot kick but keeper @entity33 guessed right and saved			0
@entity11 then had the ball in the net but was incorrectly flagged offside in what was turning into a nightmare first away game for the holders			0
on 24 minutes @entity2 's @entity107 won his second penalty of the night with an exaggerated tumble after contact from @entity36			1
he put the penalty the same side and this time , despite @entity33 going the right way again , the net bulged and @entity2 were level			2
three minutes before half time @entity20 had the chance to put the visitors ahead but dragged his shot wide from @entity60 ’s pass			0
the midfielder had been the away side ’s best player but there was little competition with @entity57 and @entity58 below par and @entity2 missing @entity64 , who had been left on the bench			2
@entity4 midfielder @entity39 celebrates scoring the opener as his side take the lead against @entity2 in their @entity130 match after a corner , @entity131 @entity39 got on the end of a flick - on at the near post to head home from close range @entity4 players chase @entity39 ( left ) as they celebrate taking the lead against the @entity141 giants at the @entity143 stadium in @entity32 the crowd in @entity3 's capital @entity32 goes wild as the home team takes a shock @entity6 lead @entity11 ( left ) has the ball on a string as he 's closed down by @entity4 midfielder @entity38 ( right ) @entity4 defender @entity37 fouls @entity20 in the penalty area to give away one of two penalties in the first half @entity57 improved at the start of the second half and could have put @entity2 ahead with a header from an @entity60 cross that @entity33 did well to save			1
@entity2 ’s next chance was not saved but missed , dreadfully , by @entity20			2
the former @entity21 striker only had to tap in @entity60 ’s centre after a classic @entity2 counter-attack involving a 30 - metre sprint from @entity57 and a pass from @entity11 , but somehow ‘ @entity20 ’ spooned his effort away from goal			1
ludogorets had chances to take the lead and only a fine save from @entity52 prevented @entity39 from scoring his and the @entity3 ’ second			1
@entity11 takes his first penalty attempt of the match as @entity4 goalkeeper @entity33 picks the right way @entity175 picks the direction @entity11 is going from the spot but this time it has too much power for the hosts to maintain their lead @entity11 ( left ) celebrates his successful second penalty attempt with @entity57 ( right ) just in case the world forgets for a moment , @entity11 reminds us of his famous number @entity11 points to the number on his back as he chalks up yet another @entity6 goal @entity9 finally made a change and predictably it was @entity20 who made way for @entity25			1
the @entity193 immediately set up @entity11 but his effort was cleared off the line by @entity37			0
@entity25 then saved @entity2 ’s blushes with the late winner from @entity56 ’s cross			2
the full back made an important clearance to maintain the visitors ' advantage moments later and @entity57 brought a fine save from @entity33 at the death			0
@entity2 were off the hook and go into their double - header with @entity207 on six points			0
but this was yet more evidence that the biggest of the big spenders have weaknesses that @entity215 ’ side will hope to expose			0
@entity2 get more of a battle than many will have expected as @entity4 ' @entity218 ( left ) and @entity56 ( right ) make unwieldy attempts for the ball @entity2 's @entity60 , probably their best player on the night , withstands a hefty challenge from @entity223 ( right ) @entity60 is forced to defend as @entity224 attempts to run through the @entity2 defence @entity2 's @entity193 forward @entity25 calmly volleys home to give the @entity6 holders the lead in @entity3			1

@entity3 's @entity4 took the lead through @entity131 @entity39 who headed in from a corner
@entity2 's @entity11 had a chance to equalise from the penalty spot but it was saved
the star striker took his second *invitation* to slot home from the spot though in the 25th minute
@entity25 gave @entity2 the lead when he calmly *slotted* a volley 10 minutes after coming off the bench
@entity11 's penalty takes him to 69 @entity6 goals , two short of @entity16 's competition record
