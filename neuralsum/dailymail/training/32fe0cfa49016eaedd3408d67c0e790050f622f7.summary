it was once the world 's fourth biggest sea , a vast lake in the middle of the @entity4			1
however , a massive water diversion project begun by the @entity6 in the 1960s has caused it to shrink dramatically - and this year , to dry up completely for the first time			1
this series of images from @entity13 ’s @entity12 satellite reveals the shocking change			1
in the 1960s , the @entity6 undertook a major water diversion project on the arid plains of @entity26 , @entity27 , and @entity28			2
the region ’s two major rivers , fed by snowmelt and precipitation in faraway mountains , were used to transform the desert into farms for cotton and other crops			2
before the project , the @entity16 and the @entity18 rivers flowed down from the mountains , cut northwest through the @entity4 , and finally pooled together in the lowest part of the basin			1

the lake they made , the @entity51 , was once the fourth largest in the world			1
although irrigation made the desert bloom , it devastated the @entity51			2
this series of images from the @entity60 ( @entity60 ) on @entity13 ’s @entity12 satellite documents the changes			1
at the start of the series in 2000 , the lake was already a fraction of its 1960 extent ( black line )			1
the @entity69 ( sometimes called the @entity70 ) had separated from the @entity71 ( large ) @entity51			0
the @entity72 had split into eastern and western lobes that remained tenuously connected at both ends			0
these images show the incredible changes in the region			1
taken on august 15th 2001 ( left ) and august 19th 2014 , they show the entire central area has dried up			1
by 2001 , the southern connection had been severed , and the shallower eastern part retreated rapidly over the next several years			0
especially large retreats in the eastern lobe of the @entity84 appear to have occurred between 2005 and 2009 , when drought limited and then cut off the flow of the @entity18			0
water levels then fluctuated annually between 2009 and 2014 in alternately dry and wet years			1
dry conditions in 2014 caused the @entity84 ’s eastern lobe to completely dry up for the first time in modern times			1
as the lake dried up , fisheries and the communities that depended on them collapsed			1
the increasingly salty water became polluted with fertilizer and pesticides			0
the blowing dust from the exposed lakebed , contaminated with agricultural chemicals , became a public health hazard			0
according to @entity13 , the loss of the water 's moderating influence has also led to more extreme temperatures in the region , making winters colder and summers hotter and drier			1
@entity109 's mayor @entity108 points at a fishing boat on dry dock 23 march 1999 near the city of @entity113 in the @entity51			1
the @entity51 is actually not a sea at all			1
it is an immense lake , a body of fresh water , although that particular description of its contents might now be more a figure of speech than practical fact			2
beginning in the 1960s , farmers and state offices in @entity27 , @entity26 , and @entity126 states opened significant diversions from the rivers that supply water to the lake , thus siphoning off millions of gallons to irrigate cotton fields and rice paddies			2
as recently as 1965 , the @entity51 received about 50 cubic kilometers of fresh water per year — a number that fell to zero by the early 1980s			0
consequently , concentrations of salts and minerals began to rise in the shrinking body of water			0
the @entity51 supported a thriving commercial fishing industry employing roughly 60,000 people in the early 1960s			0
by 1977 , the fish harvest was reduced by 75 percent , and by the early 1980s the commercial fishing industry had been eliminated			0
the shrinking @entity51 has also had a noticeable affect on the region 's climate			2
the growing season there is now shorter , causing many farmers to switch from cotton to rice , which demands even more diverted water			0
a secondary effect of the reduction in the @entity51 ’s overall size is the rapid exposure of the lake bed			2
strong winds that blow across this part of @entity160 routinely pick up and deposit tens of thousands of tons of now exposed soil every year			0
the salty dust blew off the lakebed and settled onto fields , degrading the soil			0
croplands had to be flushed with larger and larger volumes of river water			0
the loss of the moderating influence of such a large body of water made winters colder and summers hotter and drier			0
in a last - ditch effort to save some of the lake , @entity26 built a dam between the northern and southern parts of the @entity51			1
completed in 2005 , the dam was basically a death sentence for the southern @entity51 , which was judged to be beyond saving			0
all of the water flowing into the desert basin from the @entity16 now stays in the @entity183			0
between 2005 and 2006 , the water levels in that part of the lake rebounded significantly and very small increases are visible throughout the rest of the time period			1
the differences in water color are due to changes in sediment .			0
