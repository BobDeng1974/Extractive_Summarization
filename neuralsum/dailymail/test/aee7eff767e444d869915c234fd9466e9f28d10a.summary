@entity0 recalls the reaction of his friends on the day he set himself up as an independent boxing business and told them : ' the time will come when i make a hundred million dollars in one night			1
' he says : ' they told me i was crazy			0
' that was when he broke away from @entity10 , who is the promoter of the other combatant in the richest fight of all time			1
@entity14 will also earn more than $ 100million in @entity15 on may 2			1
but @entity16 takes special pride in being his own boss as they break the boxing bank			1
@entity16 hits the pads with his uncle @entity22 during a media workout at his @entity15 gym @entity16 is a little more than two weeks away from the richest - ever boxing fight against @entity14 @entity16 works to the body with co-trainer @entity27 in front of a huge crowd at his gym @entity31 and @entity16 's daughter @entity32 were also at the workout @entity16 boxing camp coordinator @entity34 helps his cousin do neck exercises as he works out as the master of his own destiny , the man who calls himself @entity40 dictated when this mega- mega-fight between the two best boxers on the planet would happen			1
' five years too late , ' cry the critics			1
' it 's all in the timing , ' smiles @entity0			1
five years ago they would have split $ 60m at most			1
five years ago only the boxing fraternity would have been paying attention			1
five years ago we would have pitched up at his gym when we liked			1
now @entity16 will bank upwards of $ 180m , @entity14 $ 120m			1
now the whole wide world is waiting their collision with bated breath			0
on this frantic tuesday , heavy security guarded the @entity59 for his media day			1
cameras from more than 30 television stations , scores of journalists and his usual crew of friends and admirers await and eventually witness a nominal workout in that overcrowded , overheated room			1
ironically , given that the human threat to his unbeaten record is from @entity74 , the location is in a mini-chinatown			0
does @entity0 eat @entity76 ? there are @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity81 cafes ... but no restaurants specialising in @entity76 food			0
@entity84 puts tape over the eyes and mouth of an image of @entity14 on the wall members of the media and @entity16 's team wait for the arrival of the main attraction at his gym @entity16 's hands are wrapped before he is put through his paces in front of the watching media @entity16 is flanked by his team as his hands are wrapped before the workout on tuesday @entity16 switches to the bag as he shows off the skills he believes will be enough to beat @entity14 @entity16 suspects @entity14 has a neurosis about being the smaller man , which leads him to wear lifts in the heel of his shoes when they stand face to face			1
asked if he thought @entity14 had been bothered by anything at their fight - launch stare - down , @entity16 said : ' he 's been surprised to see me so much bigger and taller			1
and i know he wears little lifts in his shoes			0
' the tale of the tape measures @entity16 standing 5ft 8in , @entity14 5ft 6½ in			1
@entity16 arrived , somewhat on the late side , in his new , state - of - the - art , very expensive @entity120			1
he was preceded into the parking lot by his latest girlfriend driving an even costlier white @entity125 coupe			0
the rest of the super-charged fleet stayed home in the mansion 's garage			1
@entity0 was followed to work by an @entity132 police car			0
only this time they were not chasing the man who has had his run - ins with the law			2
they were guarding one of the most important assets of the city of @entity15 , which stands to profit by billions in big fight week			2
' this thing just grows and grows , ' says @entity16			1
' we now have one of the biggest fights ever in boxing history			2
and its not only about the money			0
' one fight wo n't define my legacy			2
what about the 47 i 've already won ? ' it 's an important fight			1
it wraps everything together – the money and my boxing			2
' but if one fight defined everything this would be the only one i 'd have needed			2
' and after this , he says , there will be only one more			0
because it no longer amuses him like it did			2
' i 'm pretty much done with all this , ' he tells a few of us summoned into a pocket in the middle of a crowd of people and cameras huge enough to do justice to a royal wedding			0
' it 's not fun like it was back then , ' he explains			2
' it 's business now			2
i do n't really enjoy it any longer			2
' he promises to fulfil the sixth and last fight of his mega-millions @entity186 pay - per - view contract : ' final one at the @entity188 in september			1
' @entity189 adjusts @entity16 's gloves as he works out at his @entity15 gym @entity16 hits a speed bag as he works out in front of a poster of @entity14 with his eyes and mouth taped @entity16 works out with his trainers as the media swarm around the ring to get a glimpse of the superstar @entity16 took time to speak to the media at one of the few such events before fight week in @entity15 @entity16 speaks to the media with the giant figure of @entity14 looming in the background why always the @entity188 ? he grins , shakes a right wrist wrapped in a glittering diamond and gold bracelet			1
it reminds him of the first time tickets for a fight of his there sold out inside six minutes and he happened to mention he had noticed a bejewelled watch in a shop window at one of the @entity218 hotels			1
' they just went and got it as a gift for me , ' he says			0
' ran to about $ 400,000			2
' he 's come a long way from the drug - strewn , gangland streets of @entity227 , @entity228 where he grew up in poverty			1
but much as those baubles are stamped with the hallmarks of his journey to wealth and fame , @entity16 knows it was a human quality which made it possible			1
' loyalty , ' he says			0
' loyalty is the heartbeat of boxing			2
whenever i need something the @entity218 get it for me			0
when i fight one of the biggest fights of all time , i take it to the @entity188			2
' the clamour around him never stops but there have been heavily hyped events like this before which have turned into anti-climax for the public			2
will this one be worth the money , at $ 10,000 for a ringside seat rising to more than $ 200,000 on the black market , at virtually $ 100 per pay - per - view buy here in @entity261 ? it 's all in the timing : ' our names are way bigger than five years ago			1
you have the two best in the world fighting each other , at the pinnacle of their careers			0
and our styles should work			0
' @entity16 warms up by doing sit ups before he works out in front of the media having arrived late for his own workout , @entity16 worked up a sweat with his trainers @entity16 laughs with @entity279 , who was among the celebrities to attend the workout @entity261 rapper @entity282 also stopped by the gym to watch @entity16 perform his workout @entity285 and @entity279 arrive at the gym in @entity15 to see @entity16 put through his paces not that @entity16 is exactly jumping around in frenzied expectation : ' i 'm not excited			1
this is another fight for me			2
yeah it 's big but basically it 's no different from all the others			2
once we get in that ring it 's a level playing field			0
' at my age ( 38 ) i 'm over getting nervous about an opponent			0
i 'm past getting wound up			0
what i have to do is get in that ring and be myself			0
' that , he is sure , will be enough to win			0
but he carries a quiet air of confidence			0
there is much speculation about @entity14 storming his fabled defence but he says : ' we 'll see			1
i know i can make adjustments to any fighter			0
whatever he does , i can assess and make changes if i have to			0
' i 'm calm , smooth , calculated and thinking five steps ahead of any opponent			0
but can he adjust ? he 's a reckless fighter			0
we saw that when he got knocked out by ( @entity316			0
' all in the timing ? @entity16 is grateful that @entity14 has survived long enough to play his part in what is fast approaching a half - billion dollar extravaganza			1
' if i fought as reckless as @entity14 , ' he says			1
' i would n't be here today			0
i 'd be beaten up , worn out			0
i 've controlled my fights			0
' @entity16 works the heavy bag with just over two weeks to go before he steps into the ring with @entity14 @entity16 throws a right hook as he continues to show off his skills on the pads with his uncle @entity16 throws an uppercut as dozens of cameras are trained on the superstar from the ring apron @entity16 takes a break from his workout in the heat of his @entity15 gym @entity16 wipes away the sweat as he is put through his paces on a warm day in @entity340 @entity14 has also fought more often so by that assessment it is fortunate for him , @entity16 and their bankers that he is two years the younger			1
@entity16 pauses and adds : ' if i had n't made that decision to be my own boss i would n't be where i will be in the @entity188 on may 2			1
' wherever he goes in his adopted home town , be it a booming casino , a heaving night club or his favourite fast food joint @entity355 on the @entity356 , mr @entity357 brews up a storm			0
one created by the nature of the desert blows into the marquee in which we are talking			0
as most of the group run for cover @entity16 plays pretend scared , then strolls into his gym			1
it seems nothing frightens this man who arrived for work this day in a convoy of ludicrously expensive vehicles			0
not a @entity375 sand storm			0
not @entity376 blowing in from the @entity76 .			0

@entity16 held media workout at his gym - but turned up late
