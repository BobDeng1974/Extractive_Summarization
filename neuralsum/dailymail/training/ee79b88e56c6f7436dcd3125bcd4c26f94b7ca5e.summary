by @entity0 published : 11:07 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 12:26 est , 26 february 2013 it 's the product of 520 metres of tin foil , 580 plastic cups , 62 litres of water and a whole lot of time to kill that only students could enjoy			1
business undergraduate @entity8 returned to his room after a week away to find his housemates had covered everything , from his surfboard to his lacrosse sticks , in aluminium wrapping			1
for good measure , the pranksters had also placed hundreds of cups filled with water on the floor , making the room look more like a bizarre lunar module than a student 's sleeping quarters			2
' i was absolutely gobsmacked			2
i was in so much shock , ' the 19 - year - old @entity26 student told @entity28			2
it 's a wrap ! @entity26 student @entity8 came back to his digs after a week away to find his housemates had covered everything in his bedroom in tin foil as a practical joke prank patrol : six of @entity8 's housemates spent four days wrapping everything from his dvds to his fruit bowl and bed stead while he was away at home for the week tools of the trade : the students used 520 metres of tin foil and yards of @entity47 for the prank glaringly obvious : @entity8 's housemates have a history of practical jokes so he made sure to lock his door not knowing they had secretly propped his widnow open ' it had taken me more than four hours to drive back so i was pretty exhausted			1
' it took me hours to take it all the foil down and it was quite a job emptying all the cups			1
i still have n't got rid of them all			0
' the prank was conjured up by his seven housemates when @entity8 had gone home to @entity65 for a week earlier this month			1
as they have a history of playing practical jokes on each other , @entity8 made a point before leaving of gleefully telling them that he had locked his bedroom door			1
before and after : the pranksters also filled the room with 580 plastic cups filled with water for good measure work in progress : some of the housemates worked on covering the walls while the others wrapped individual items like his fruit and dvds gutted : @entity8 even sent his mates a text saying ' bad luck ! ' thinking they could n't get into his room @entity90 effort : among the items they wrapped were his computer monitor , keyboard , two surfboards and his lacrosse sticks 6 housemates ( one was away ) 4 days 520 metres tin foil ( 26 x 20m ) 580 plastic cups 62 litres of water he even sent them a text later saying : ' bad luck ! ' but little did he know that they had secretly left his window ajar so they could climb in once he was gone			1
fellow business undergraduate , @entity110 , 20 , said : ' it was great because we had access to his room all week			0
' we had a house meeting and decided that we wanted to wrap everything in the room with something			0
' we went for tin foil because it was easy to wrap and looks really impressive			0
game for a laugh : @entity8 took the joke in good humour			2
in fact , his housemates were miffed he was n't more annoyed best of friends : @entity8 ( far right ) with his fellow housemates ( l - r ) @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 ( green stripey shirt ) , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity110 ( black t - shirt ) and @entity137 ' some of us did the walls , while others did individual items like the fruit bowl			2
we even wrapped each of his dvds individually			0
it was a real team effort			0
' among the other items they wrapped were his computer monitor , keyboard , two surfboards and his lacrosse sticks			0
having finally completed it after four days , they hid to see @entity8 's reaction when he returned on sunday , february 16			1
@entity110 said : ' as soon as he opened the door , he saw the walls and said " oh my @entity158 ! " ' we were a bit annoyed he was n't more annoyed			0
he was actually very impressed			0

@entity8 ' gobsmacked ' when he returned to find room *transformed*
he locked door before leaving because they have history of playing jokes
but he was *unaware* mates had left his window ajar so they could get in
@entity8 : ' i was in so much shock . it took me hours to take it all the foil down '
