down on the farm : sir @entity1 with his first wife @entity2 on the estate in the early 1970s he was so happy there he wrote it a ‘ love letter ’ that became a massive chart hit			1
but @entity1 ’s estate in the @entity9 is now at the centre of an embarrassing row after he dismissed two members of staff			1
caretaker @entity14 has been given three months to leave his tied cottage , and estate manager @entity17 has been fired			1
it is understood the pair , with 55 years of service between them , are under strict contractual instructions not to reveal any details			2
but their friends and families said last night the sackings came out of the blue , and they believe sir @entity1 has fallen out of love with south - west @entity31			1
one neighbour said : ‘ i think he lost faith in @entity9 when @entity2 died [ in 1998 ]			1
he ’s hardly been here			2
’ the former @entity35 , who is 71 , bought the remote farm in 1966 and it became a refuge where his late wife @entity2 and he found solace , and where their children spent the summer holidays			1
he bought two neighbouring farms in later years and created a 600 - acre wildlife haven			0
‘ it seems like he ’s lost interest , ’ said the neighbour			0
‘ he came far more when wings were on the go			0
he was around more in his heyday , when he ’d come in his private plane			0
‘ and that ’s when he had the big gates and the guards			0
‘ i do n’t think he ’ll be planning to sell the land – he ’ll just be trying to make it more of a viable unit			0
but unfortunately these two chaps are going to lose their jobs			0
‘ somebody else said he ’s got a new factor , someone who looks after his estate , and they ’ve seen that it ’s been losing money			2
so we think that might be why			0
’ mr @entity14 , 50 , who lives at @entity70 with fiancée @entity71 , 51 , and their 17 dogs , takes care of day - to - day business			1
yesterday miss @entity71 ’s mother @entity76 said : ‘ i know @entity71 will be hurting badly , and @entity14 will be as well			1
i do n’t know where they ’ll go			0
' @entity71 had a house before she moved to the farm but she gave that up			2
the @entity35 , 71 , famously sang that he wanted to always live there			1
but since then he has fallen out of love with it ' it is a shocking thing to have happened , especially with @entity14 being there 20 years			1
' you ’d think they ’d be given more than three months			2
‘ i hope she is alright			0
the farm was her life			2
’ mr @entity17 , 52 , who lives in nearby @entity93 , was also staying tight - lipped			1
a friend of sir @entity1 said the decision had not been made lightly , and added : ‘ the land has been allowed to fall into a state of disrepair this last 15 years or so , hence making the change in management			0
‘ they want to bring the land back up to scratch and make it workable again			0
it ’s time for a change			0
the @entity106 spent their time in their ' little hideaway ' with children @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 ' @entity113 will be involved and @entity1 ’s people are taking advice on what to do			2
’ sir @entity1 once described the farm as a ‘ little hideaway ’ , adding : ‘ it is a lovely place			1
i love the people up there			2
‘ i am so relaxed up there , i can sort of breathe when i get up there , pure air			0
’ following @entity2 ’s death from breast cancer in 1998 , a statue of her cradling a lamb was set up in a memorial garden in @entity93			1
more recently , the sprawling farm was listed as a £ 1.5million asset during sir @entity1 and @entity133 ’s divorce battle			1
last night a spokesman for sir @entity1 declined to comment .			0

the £ 1.5m @entity31 estate was a ' little hideaway ' for the @entity138
@entity14 , caretaker , has been given three months to leave his connecting cottage and @entity17 , estate manager , has been fired
the sackings were completely *unexpected* , friends and families claim
@entity146 say the @entity35 , 71 , fell out of love with farm when @entity2 died
