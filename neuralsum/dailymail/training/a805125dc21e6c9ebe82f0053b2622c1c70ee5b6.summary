teenager @entity66 won back possession in the middle of the field before feeding @entity20 who spread play out wide to @entity19			0

the @entity107 international came close again in the first half when some neat interchanging passes on the edge of the area led to @entity19 playing a scooped pass over the top of the defence , which @entity21 met with a volley but skewed his effort wide			0
@entity19 's role as a creator reaped rewards again after the interval when , with @entity4 still dictating play , the fleet footed winger cut in from the left and squared for @entity24 who dinked the ball over @entity127 and stayed on his feet to double @entity4 's lead			2
@entity19 embraces @entity24 after providing an assist for the @entity131 to score @entity4 's second @entity20 completed his brace with the outside of his boot before being substituted to a standing ovation @entity20 's second goal was started by a lung - busting run from @entity25 - click here for more stats from our brilliant @entity44 @entity20 scored his first goal through power but relied on touch for his second @entity21 and @entity19 race to celebrate @entity20 's second goal at the @entity3 @entity20 netted his second only four minutes late following a rapid counter attack on the opposite flank where @entity25 found @entity66 and the 19 - year - old drilled in a low cross for the striker to finish exquisitely with the outside of his boot			1
