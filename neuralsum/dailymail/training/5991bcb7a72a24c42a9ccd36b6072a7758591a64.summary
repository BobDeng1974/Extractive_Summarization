by @entity0 the @entity1 has sent me over the edge this week			1
i 've spent hours fantasising about repeatedly clumping her over the head with one of my two - year - old ’s mangled barbies in an act of maternal revenge			0
@entity11 , who put us all on the naughty step because our toddlers could n't play the harp or speak five languages , has given interviews across the world claiming that her controversial parenting book , @entity1 was meant to be ironic , that her hardline guide to bringing up successful children was a bit of a laugh			1
she may not have actually used those words , but may as well have done			0
she now claims that the book , which caused a parental firestorm , was only ‘ a tenth ’ true , and that even though she told thousands of anxious parents that tv should be banned and encouraging free will is the path to @entity30 not a-grades - she did n't mean it			2
now she tells us : @entity11 caused controversy with her parenting book , right , but said recently it 's meant to be ironic sure she once called one daughter ' garbage ' for some minor misdemeanour and threw away the other 's @entity39 birthday card because it was n't artistic enough , but in reality she was n't anywhere near as rigorous in her boot - camp parenting as she had claimed			1
most irritating of all , she said that if she were to write the book again - or have another go at bringing up her two daughters , now aged 18 and 21 - she would be even more permissive than she secretly was			2
she would be more like us , the mothers she made feel like failures as we did n't demand more from our offspring			1
what a cruel trick to play			0
out of her international bestseller , a term - @entity1 - was born and debated endlessly			1
it is now part of the parenting conversation			0
the 2011 book also prompted a round of unhelpful questions over what exactly is the right regime to bring up ' better ' children			2
born to it @entity1 author @entity11 was born in 1962 , @entity64 year of the tiger even though i had no intention of taking any notice of what she recommended , i still felt the cold wind of disapproval at my own parenting style			1
should i be doing more , pushing them harder at school ? maybe they should be practising something worthy as opposed to repeatedly videoing themselves pretending to trip over the sleeping dog in order to make a fake you ’ve been framed film			0
perhaps i should n't have laughed so hard at the flyer for @entity85 maths and instead signed them up for saturday morning classes ? this is why i am so furious at @entity11 's revelation that she duped us into believing her extreme parenting methods were real			1
every day new clues on the best way to be a mum are flung at us because we ’re such a fragile , eager audience , desperate to devour any useful fact			0
after all , none of us has done this before , and it ’s terrifying			0
we pounce on knowledge like sugar addicts on a @entity102			0
will our way turn out to be the right way ? will the latest received wisdom help make sense of the mothering conundrums ? we do n't expect a @entity108 - like deception			0
it makes us feel bad , @entity11			1
i can cope with medics now blaming that glass of wine i had when i was nine months ' pregnant for my 10 - year - old 's inability to do vulgar fractions , but a whole furore created ( and then endlessly debated ) by a book that was n't even true is infuriating			2
it turns out that the @entity1 has no more insight than any of the other parenting tomes like @entity123 by @entity124 , which is at least funny , or @entity127 children do n't throw food by @entity129 , which is accidentally funny			1
@entity11 's new book , written with husband @entity132 , which prompted her to give these ' clear the air ' interviews , sounds dull : an academic foray into the common characteristics which make people from different cultures and religions successful			1
the triple package : what determines success is a complicated read that makes me want to retire to a dark room and watch @entity147 videos of kittens while i work out just why i ’m so unreasonably cross about @entity1 ’s reckless confession			2
i feel like writing my own fake @entity151 parenting book but other matters are more pressing - getting the theme tune to @entity154 , @entity155 , out of my mind , for one			2
actually , maybe that is the title of my new parenting bible			0
but would you believe anything in a book with that title ? @entity163 is editor - in - chief of @entity164 .			0

@entity11 wrote controversial book , @entity1
made *millions* of mothers feel *inadequate*
now she says it was ironic
