@entity1 ’s racing coverage have been dealt a blow with news that flagship presenter @entity4 is to cut back her appearances from 40 to only nine per year			1
in 2015 , @entity4 will only front the @entity1 ’s racing output from the @entity7 and @entity8			1
the station can take some comfort from the fact that @entity4 has signed a two - year deal and will also present their coverage of the @entity15 dog show and 2016 paralympics in @entity17			0
@entity4 will continue to work for @entity1 , but will be involved far less in 2015 the experienced broadcaster will miss the @entity19 and the @entity20 this year @entity4 will broadcast on just nine days for @entity1 in 2015 the fact that @entity4 , 43 , has cut back on her work in racing was expected			1
she is in an in - demand presenter whose profile has soared way beyond the narrow confines of the racing world			0
but not chosing to present coverage of the boat race over the @entity19 in april and also step down from the @entity20 at @entity31 in june is a bitter blow			0
@entity34 , who will now assume the position of lead presenter , is a hugely talented broadcaster , but , without @entity4 , there is no - one on the team who can claim national recognition with appeal to a broader constituency of viewers			0
@entity4 said : ‘ i have been lucky and honoured to work as a racing broadcaster for the past 20 years and will continue to promote the sport on and off screen			0
‘ i look forward to working with the enormously talented @entity47 team at @entity7 and @entity8 next year and , of course , to the @entity16 in @entity17 in 2016			1
@entity50 , @entity1 ’s @entity49 said : ‘ @entity4 is a broadcaster at the very top of her game and i ’m delighted that we will be continuing to work with her on our racing coverage and the @entity16 in 2016			2
’ on @entity4 ’s decision to choose the @entity57 over the @entity19 , a @entity47 spokeswoman said : ‘ she is very big supporter of female sport and wants to be involved with the first ever televised female @entity57 which will be an historical event			2

@entity4 will only host coverage of @entity7 and @entity8
