' i hope to build a life so huge outside the strip club that i wo n't need to dance anymore because i am too busy writing and teaching ; creating other moments of joy and human connection in the classroom and on the page ; to rise so far in that field that i wo n't need to land into laps again , but until that happens , i will strip			1
