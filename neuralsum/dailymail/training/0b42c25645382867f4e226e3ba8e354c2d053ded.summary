@entity0 delivered a scathing indictment of @entity2 on thursday night in @entity3 , teeing up a presidential run with a speech that took little notice of presumptive @entity8 favorite @entity7 and instead castigated the president as feckless , clueless and gutless			1
just 16 days removed from the 10,000 - square - foot @entity12 governor 's mansion , @entity0 is on the road and shaping the messages that will accompany a @entity16 campaign			1
he stopped in @entity17 deliver rhetorical red - meat to a friendly and very conservative audience			2
the early going has been kind to the @entity12 : while reporters ca n't let go of his calamitous ' oops ! ' moment in 2011 , he raised political eyebrows on thursday by unveiling a list of 80 financial power brokers who will shake the trees and make rain for him			1
one of those financiers , who requested anonymity , told @entity33 on thursday – in advance of the governor 's address to the conservative @entity37 – that @entity0 is confident he can win			1
' he and his wife believe they are touched by @entity41 , and that this is his time , ' the donor said			1
' it 's like – they ca n't lose – that 's the sense of it			0
' ' i do n't know if he 'll win the nomination , but i 'm absolutely sure he 'll be one of the last two republicans standing , ' he added during a phone interview			0
@entity0 got a warm reception in @entity3 on thursday with themes that hammered president @entity2 and pointed toward a second presidential run pressing the flesh : @entity0 mingled in a room full of hundreds of right - wingers at an event hosted by the @entity37 , which opposes abortion and gay marriage @entity0 shunned reporters on thursday night after his speech – @entity65 gov. @entity64 held a press conference after his lunchtime remarks – but his turn at the podium during the nighttime gala brimmed with that confidence – half campaign stemwinder , half inaugural address			1
he lifted a line from @entity76 's 1993 inauguration , where the 41st president said , ' there is nothing wrong with @entity80 that can not be cured with what is right with @entity80			1
' @entity0 's version took aim at @entity2			1
' there is nothing wrong in @entity80 today , ' he said , ' that ca n't be fixed with a change in leadership			1
' that change is sure to come in january 2017 , but it 's anyone 's guess who will move into @entity16			0
' our nation is on a slow glide - path to decline , ' @entity0 said thursday night			1
and @entity51 see eight more years of a @entity8 administration as a political doomsday			2
the @entity51 has a deep bench , with no fewer than 20 would - be nominees talking about running			1
they include governors , senators , former ceos and diplomats , and a pediatric surgeon			0
democrats , on the other hand , have @entity7 , the former first lady , @entity80 senator and secretary of state			2
and few others judged as powerful enough or daring enough to challenge her			0
knowing who will likely await them in @entity80 's political @entity111 has allowed @entity51 @entity16 hopefuls to keep their anti-hillary powder dry and hold their best attacks until 2016 when they will matter most			1
instead @entity0 and others are focusing their energy on @entity2			2
the governor 's speech on thursday could have been the one he delivered on the stump in 2012 if his first presidential bid had n't imploded when he could n't remember which three federal cabinet agencies he had said he would close if he won the presidency			0
he hit @entity2 on foreign policy , on energy , on the economy and jobs , and on that distinctly @entity12 concern : illegal immigration			0
and he slapped @entity51 , as @entity65 gov. @entity64 had earlier in the day during an @entity37 lunch , for risking the loss of their congressional majorities by straying too close to the political middle			1
three years and one ' @entity135 : @entity0 was all smiles in october 2011 when he filed the paperwork for his name to appear on the @entity140 primary ballot @entity141 : the @entity12 governor wound up his crowd with reliable conservative themes and spent most of his time at the podium railnig against the @entity2 administration @entity148 to run ? @entity0 is road - testing themes for future speeches when the political stakes will be as high as any in @entity80 history @entity80 , he said , rejected the @entity2 administration in november – citing ' the @entity154 allowing our heroes to die , the @entity157 targeting citizens , the administration trading five terrorists for a military deserter , the rise of @entity167 , the lies upon which @entity161 was passed , ( and ) the weakest economic recovery in history			1
' ' but let ’s be clear about something , ' he said in the @entity170 just a mile from the @entity80 @entity171 : ' the @entity80 voters ’ rejection of the @entity8 does not mean they embraced @entity51			1
' ' a congressional majority is a terrible thing to waste			1
' similarly , @entity64 had warned against the @entity51 slouching toward status as ' @entity178 - lite			1
' both men are rock - ribbed conservatives			0
along with @entity12 sen. @entity180 and @entity182 gov. @entity181 , they will inhabit the right flank of the @entity51 ' march through next year 's political playoffs			2
@entity0 spat out a litany of @entity188 sentiments that could have come out of a tea party convention platform			2
' six years of study on the @entity191 , and still nothing happens , ' he said			0
' when @entity194 was invading @entity195 , the president dithered when he could have sent a powerful message to the @entity198 president			0
' ' our broken , outdated tax code has become an incubator of corruption , favoritism and bureaucratic harassment			0
' ' we need to stop strangling small businesses with over-regulation			0
' @entity0 , seldom soft - spoken , took special umbrage at @entity2 's plan to mainstream more than 5 million illegal immigrants with residency cards and work permits while hundreds of thousands more pour across the @entity80 - @entity213 border with drugs and human chattel			1
' those who smuggle children , enslave women , destroy lives by peddling illegal drugs and weapons , they are the face of evil , ' @entity0 boomed			2
' @entity12 has done more to secure the border than any state in the nation , ' he exclaimed			0
' and the message is clear : as long as @entity3 will not secure the border , @entity12 will			2
' 2016 starts now : @entity65 gov. @entity64 spoke earlier in the day to the @entity37 , the same group @entity0 appeared with at night @entity0 was loose on thursday night , free - wheeling his words as he boasted about his state 's economic boom			1
. ' more people have moved to @entity12 than any other state , ' he said			0
' lem me give you a little news - flash here – it 's not because of our great weather in august			0
' at times he strayed near the eccentricities of an infamous october 2011 speech in @entity140 that was so disengaged and free - spirited that political observers suspected he was drunk			1
@entity0 spent a week denying it , and was rescued from the biggest headlines only by businessman @entity250 's sexual harassment scandal			2
the ' @entity252 ' collapse came less than two weeks later			0
on that occasion , he said later , he was on painkillers for a back ailment			0
but @entity0 has never styled himself as a practiced orator or a charm school graduate			2
' if you 're looking for a slick politician , or a guy with great teleprompter skills , we already have that , ' he said in one 2011 commercial			0
' and he 's destroying our economy			0
' ' i 'm a doer , not a talker			0

@entity0 appeared at the annual gala of the @entity80 *principles* project , an *anti-abortion* , anti-gay marriage group in @entity3
he unveiled a list of 80 high - powered *fundraisers* who will work for him as he *explores* the presidential *landscape*
one of them said ' he and his wife believe they are touched by @entity41 , and that this is his time '
@entity0 warned that ' our nation is on a slow glide - path to decline ' and *cautioned* other @entity51 that ' a congressional majority is a terrible thing to waste '
free - wheeling style was nearly as loose as october 2011 , when @entity0 was so off - the - cuff in @entity140 that *pundits* suspected he was drunk
