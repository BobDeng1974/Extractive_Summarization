@entity26 carried out the same survey in 2002 and 2005 in most of those countries , enabling researchers to look at trends over time			2
but the data also suggested that there is a limit to how much happiness money can buy			2
for example , 56 per cent of @entity61 rated their life a ' seven ' or higher on the ladder , significantly more than the 36 per cent in @entity109 , a poor country			0
yet the public in @entity31 , which has far higher gross domestic product per capita than @entity61 , expressed a life satisfaction level of 60 per cent , just four per cent more than @entity61			1
