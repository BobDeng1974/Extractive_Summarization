the short - term loan window that opens next tuesday for six weeks is vital for cash - strapped lower - league clubs to bring in players they ca n’t commit to signing and allows top - flight reserves to gain valuable game time			1

@entity46 is being accused of trying to derail the emergency loan system in the @entity51 but it was still rejected by the executive at their last meeting in @entity75 with @entity46 , who is perceived to have an anti-english stance , seen as the main opponent , supposedly on the grounds of competition integrity			2
