by @entity0 published : 15:11 est , 25 august 2012 updated : 06:47 est , 26 august 2012 over-joyed : colour sergeant @entity1 is preparing to return to @entity2 two years after his leg was shattered by a @entity5 bullet lying in agony in a hospital bed , his left knee shattered by a @entity5 bullet , colour sergeant @entity6 was confronted by medics with the grim news he had been dreading			1
his war injuries were so severe he would probably need his leg amputating			2
even if he kept the smashed limb , they continued , it was so badly damaged his days as a soldier were over			1
but after an incredible battle to recuperate , the inspirational 37 - year - old has defied the doctors			2
next month , he will complete his miraculous journey by returning to the @entity2 frontline with his comrades in the @entity26 ( 1 @entity27 ) – just two years after being shot			1
his determination to recover was spurred on by the desire to walk daughter @entity30 , 22 , down the aisle , unaided by crutches or a wheelchair			1
last october , she married @entity35 @entity34 – a fellow @entity36 who is also deploying to @entity38 – after entering the church on the arm of her father			2
yesterday , @entity43 , from @entity44 , @entity45 , told of his pride at being able to achieve his two ambitions since he was shot			2
he said : ‘ i have fulfilled the dreams that kept me focused while i was recovering : walking my daughter down the aisle to get married and deploying with the battalion again			1
’ the soldier , who has served with @entity53 - based 1 @entity27 for 16 years , described his remarkable story as he completed pre-deployment training on @entity56			1
his unit is part of @entity59 – nicknamed the @entity60 – which is going to @entity2 for a six - month tour of duty			1
@entity43 , a father of two , was shot during a massive push to seize the rebel - held town of @entity65 – a ‘ hornet ’s nest ’ in @entity67 , southern @entity38 , in february 2010			2
during a mission to flush out a @entity5 sniper , he confronted two insurgents laying an improvised explosive device ( @entity72 ) designed to murder and maim @entity74 troops			0
the enemy fighters were burying the homemade bomb just 150metres from a compound being used by his platoon			0
@entity43 said : ‘ it was a pretty busy day			2
i could not believe how close they were			0
it was cheeky to say the least			0
’ as he pointed the men ’s position out to his commander , ‘ all hell broke loose ’ with bullets spraying the @entity74 troops			0
before he had dashed the 10metres to the compound , an @entity89 round hit his lower left thigh			0
' horrendous pain ' : @entity94 being stretchered away after during a mission in @entity38			0
medics said he would probably lose his leg the bullet shattered the bone and split his kneecap in two			1
he said : ‘ some people who lose limbs in ied strike just sit there chilling out while first aid is carried out but i was crying like a baby			1
‘ it was one of the most horrendous pains i 've ever felt			0
but that only lasted about five minutes - the medics we had on hand were very , very good			0
‘ they administered morphine ... and calmed me down			0
’ he was evacuated from the battlefield by a @entity118 @entity117 and was on an operating table at @entity120 within 30 minutes			0
there he was told that he might lose his left leg			1
when he was flown back to @entity74 , medical staff at @entity124 in @entity125 told @entity94 they could save his leg , but he was given the devastating news that he would never ‘ soldier ’ again			1
he said : ‘ i was gutted			1
i thought about going onto civvy street with no qualifications and it was like having the carpet pulled from underneath me			1
’ incredible comeback : as this x-ray shows , the 37 - year - old had a metal plate fitted in his leg and five screws to hold his knee together after undergoing 13 operations but a visit from his daughter in hospital made him determined to recover			1
‘ she told me she was getting married			2
and that 's when i said to myself , i will walk her down the aisle			2
’ then while watching his colleagues from the @entity26 during their homecoming parade he asked himself : ‘ why not get back with the boys ? ’ the road to recovery continued at @entity153			0
he undertook a gruelling regime of physiotherapy and fitness work			0
‘ my main priority was walking @entity30 down the aisle without a walking stick			1
i achieved it – it was the proudest day of my life			0
’ he now jokingly describes the medical staff there as ‘ physio - terrorists ’ - taking no prisoners , but he is full of praise for their efforts to help him walk again			2
@entity43 had a metal plate fitted in his leg and five screws to hold his knee together			1
he has also had 13 operations			0
his left leg is 2cm shorter than his right , but he is close to regaining full mobility			0
he said : ‘ i can not fault the medical team			0
ten years ago i probably would have lost my leg but thanks to the @entity36 team medics on the ground and the doctors i am now able to deploy again			1
’ he will be stationed at @entity183 in the @entity184 , carrying out the vital task of co-ordinating supply helicopter flights for the troops there			0
@entity43 said he was ‘ slightly nervous ’ about returning to @entity2 in case he is shot again			1
‘ i could n’t cope with another two years being like a baby learning to walk , ’ he said			1
but his injuries have not deterred his 18 - year - old son @entity191 from joining the @entity192			0
he is following his father into the @entity26 and could be sent to the frontline early next year .			0
