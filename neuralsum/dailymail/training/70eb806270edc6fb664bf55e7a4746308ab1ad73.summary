in protest : @entity4 , outside her home in @entity3 , has stopped paying her council tax because of a six foot leylandii a grandmother who claims a towering hedge is breaching her ‘ right to light ’ is refusing to pay her council tax			1
pensioner @entity4 says her neighbours ’ six foot leylandii leaves her living room in constant gloom and has killed off part of her garden			1
the 83 - year - old first complained to the council about the trees in 2007 , but her claim was rejected			1
a subsequent appeal to the local government ombudsman also failed			0
lawyers for mrs @entity4 relied on laws dating back to the 19th century that state windows that have received natural light for at least 20 years are entitled to maintain this level of illumination			2
the laws can prevent a neighbour from going ahead with a home extension or have high trees if it blocks out sunshine			0
the grandmother - of - two claims the council have refused to have any further dealings with her regarding her complaint , saying it has been resolved			2
but in a bid to force a resolution she has stopped paying her council tax on her £ 200,000 semi-detached home in the hope she will get summonsed to court			1
mrs @entity4 , a retired sales assistant from @entity3 , @entity45 , said : ‘ i have a right of light and i should be able to use my land			1
‘ i have lived in this house for 50 years , and my enjoyment of my property is not the same because of this			0
my life is not the same			0
‘ i can not grow my plants where the hedge is now , it blocks out my light in my front room , and i have cracks in my paving			0
’ but neighbours @entity60 and @entity62 say old photographs show the hedge was higher still in the 1980s			2
mrs @entity62 said : ‘ we keep the hedge at two metres - we would n’t want it any taller because it would restrict the light			2
’ a @entity67 spokesman said : ‘ we investigated mrs @entity4 ’s complaint about her neighbour ’s front garden hedge in 2007			1
‘ at 2.1 metres in height , it was decided that it was not adversely affecting mrs @entity4 ’s enjoyment of her property , and this decision was upheld by the @entity77			0
‘ if mrs @entity4 wishes to pursue a right to light , she can do so as a civil matter ; the council has no legal powers to get involved			1
’ earlier this year , the @entity83 , a government advisory body , suggested the right to light was acting as a barrier to development and should be reined in			2
fight : miss @entity4 , 83 , has been complaining to the council for eight years over her neighbours ' six foot trees , pictured in background it said it had simply become a ‘ tool to extract money from a neighbour who proposes to develop his or her land ’			1
the @entity83 warns that such rights have a ‘ disproportionately negative impact upon the potential for the development of land ’			0
it wants to change the law so that new properties do not acquire a right to light after 20 years			0
the change would not affect existing rights .			0

@entity4 says neighbours ’ six foot leylandii leaves block her light
83 - year - old first complained to the council about the trees in 2007
no *longer* pays council tax on house in hope she will get court summons
