by @entity0 published : 12:10 est , 20 december 2012 updated : 13:20 est , 20 december 2012 @entity1 is set to show off a 5.5in flexible 720p display at next month 's @entity3 in @entity4 , according to reports			0
that @entity1 is choosing to present the hotly anticipated technology at the world 's premier electronics trade show strongly suggests it will be included on the company 's next generation of smartphones out next year			1
however the company will not just be presenting a tiny , phone - sized bendy screen at the event , but will also bring along a mammoth 55in version more suited for a television or monitor			1
they are a major advance on regular led displays , which are usually made on a glass surface and are thus prone to cracking and smashing			1
@entity34 reports that @entity1 will show attendees at the @entity36 a 5.5in flexible screen with a 1,280x720 hd resolution intended for smartphone use , as well as the bigger version			2
flexible displays are made by depositing organic light emitting diodes on a flexible plastic surface			2
regular led displays are usually made on a glass surface , but substituting that for a flexible plastic such as polyethylene terephthalate makes it possible to manufacture screens that are both flexible and lightweight			1
one possible mass - production method might use a technique similar to inkjet printing			2
officials from the @entity57 firm 's screen - making spin - off @entity58 told the website the new screens are able to curve without breaking , but they are n't yet ready to be rolled up or folded			1
the announcement comes after rumours began circulating earlier this month that @entity1 is secretly preparing a new version of its @entity66 handset that uses the radical , resilient new technology			1
codenamed ' @entity68 ' after mobile division chief @entity69 , development of the new @entity72 could be released as early as april , according to analysts and tech blogs			0
experts believe that as smartphones increasingly look alike , an unbreakable screen could be a big selling point for the @entity66 , which is battling @entity79 to lead the $ 200billion plus smartphone market			2
the @entity72 is also expected to have powerful quad - core processing power and a 13 - megapixel camera			2
' looking to the first half of 2013 , we see evidence of @entity1 likely accelerating the release of the @entity72 - compared with may ( this year ) for the @entity87 , ' said @entity89 analyst @entity88			1
' we believe preparations for volume manufacturing of unbreakable plastic substrate displays continue			0
' all in all , we could see a strong products push in the high - end in the first half , followed by other releases			0
' @entity19 : the breakthrough has been made by through the use of organic light emitting diodes ( @entity26 ) , which are thin and can be put on flexible material such as plastic or metal foil durable : although being bendy is their most exciting characteristic , simply using plastic to manufacture the screens rather than glass could help make phone screens less likely to crack @entity1 is a frontrunner in developing the unbreakable screens , as oled panels can replace glass substrate with plastic material			1
down the road , mobile gadgets could be flexible as well as unbreakable			0
' eventually , they 'll have unbreakable and flexible displays , ' said @entity118 , an analyst at @entity119 in @entity120 ' either the @entity72 or @entity121 will have unbreakable and even possibly flexible and foldable displays by 2014			0
' that 's going to be a game - changer			0
' both mr @entity118 and mr @entity88 are ranked as 5 - star analysts , the top ranking , by @entity128 @entity127 for their recommendations on @entity1			0
it would also be a game - changer for @entity1 , which has built its reputation as a ' fast follower ' of others ' technologies and designs			0
the @entity87 smartphone - the next version could have a radical news ' bendy ' screen , according to rumours the @entity57 consumer electronics giant is currently battling for a retrial after a @entity145 jury ruled it copied some of its smartphone rival @entity149 's patents and ordered it to pay $ 1billion in damages			1
@entity1 wants the verdict overturned , while @entity149 wants the damages to be increased and @entity1 phones banned in the @entity145 since that landmark verdict , however , @entity1 shares soared to record highs , while @entity149 shares - dented by a maps app fiasco , tight supply of its @entity161 and ever tougher competition in the mobile market - have slipped .			0

resilient , bendy displays are a major advance on previous led screens
firms officials admit they bend , but are not yet ready to roll up
follow - up to @entity87 handset could have radical new screen technology
