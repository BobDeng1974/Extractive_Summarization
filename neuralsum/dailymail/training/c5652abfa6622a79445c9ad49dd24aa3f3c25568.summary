@entity0 was given the worst beating of her @entity3 career in a sensational upset at the @entity5 today when she was beaten 6 - 2 , 6 - 2 by 20 year - old @entity6			1
the six - feet tall world no 35 , of @entity9 and @entity10 heritage , took advantage of windy and cold conditions to blow away the top seed in the second round and keep the shocks coming at @entity16			2
the women ’s draw has been blown wide open as , for the first time in the @entity5 era , the top two seeds are out before the third round following @entity24 ’s early demise			0
disaster : @entity0 suffered a huge upset as she was beaten by @entity6 in @entity27 thrashed : the no 1 seed and favourite was beaten 6 - 2 , 6 - 2 by her @entity9 opponent delighted : @entity6 celebrates her stunning victory on court @entity32 agony : @entity35 was knocked out of the @entity5 by a teenage @entity37 @entity36 realisation : @entity36 came from a set behind to knock out the @entity40 29 seeded @entity41 flying start : @entity35 seemed to be cruising towards victory when she took the first set with minimal fuss for the third time @entity0 and @entity35 have gone out on the same day at a major , with @entity35 falling earlier to @entity36 in a far less surprising result			1
@entity6 has long been identified within tennis as one of the sport ’s up and comers but this will give her a completely different profile			2
based in @entity56 , she is unlike many other @entity9 female players with her considerable height and rangey strokes , which continually had @entity0 rocking back on her heels			0
it means that there is already sure to be an unexpected champion this year , with @entity64 and the resurgent @entity65 both sure to fancy their chances .			0
