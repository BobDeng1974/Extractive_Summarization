a grandfather - of - five convicted of dangerous cycling has been left with a £ 3,000 legal bill for having his dog tethered to his bicycle			1
@entity5 , 54 , used an extended dog lead fitted on his bicycle to take his @entity8 shepherd @entity9 for a walk by the river			1
but he was stopped by police who claimed the dog caused a traffic tailback which could have had ' catastrophic consequences ' when it wandered into the @entity17 while trotting behind him			1
mr @entity5 was then detained and placed in the back of a police van when he initially refused to give his personal details			1
he relented when he was told @entity9 would be placed in kennels			1
he was found guilty at @entity22 magistrates ' court of dangerous cycling on a public road and failing to stop when directed by a police officer and failing to give his name and address			1

the maximum fine for dangerous cycling under the @entity52 is £ 2,500			1
today , mr @entity5 , a mechanic , said : ' the whole thing is outrageous - i 've been made to feel like a bank robber when as far as i 'm concerned , i 've done nothing wrong			1
i 'm not allowed to cycle on pavements so i had to go on the road and as far as i could see the traffic flowed fine			2
' i was n't going at any break neck speed , vehicles were going past and i was n't causing any obstruction			0
it 's ridiculous that i 'm now being branded a danger to the roads			0
' there are so many on the internet and when researching them they are the safest way of riding a bike with a dog			2
' everyone recommends them even the veterinary practices because it 's one of the best forms of exercise			0
this was ideal because it was quick release and it had an expanding lead			2
' i 'd used it 30 or 40 times myself and my wife mainly on country roads to get some exercise and him having a runabout			0
now i 'm warning other people not to use it after what 's happened			0
in my eyes i 've not broken the law			0
' mr @entity5 was spotted cycling on @entity97 in @entity24 with @entity9 behind him when he was pulled over the 54 - year - old said he did not believe he had committed a criminal offence when he cycled along the road the incident took place in june and mr @entity5 was detained and placed in the back of a police van when he initially refused to give his personal details - he is pictured here being brought home by police mr @entity5 shows the extended bike lead to a police officer after he was taken home following his detention the incident occurred in june in @entity24 , @entity25 when mr @entity5 had used the @entity26 set he bought on @entity27 to take five year old @entity9 to the river where he planned to take pictures of wildlife			1
he added : ' we set off back and i was n't holding anyone up on the road			2
there was nothing stuck behind me , it was 120 yards of straight road , there are no double white lines so anyone wishing to overtake me could have done			2
' traffic only stopped when the police officer pulled up in a van and told me to stop			1
he shouted stuck his head out of the window and said " that 's inappropriate			0
" ' i simply said i was on my way home			0
i dismounted but he came running down and grabbed me by the shirt and neck and pulled my bike and wanted my address			0
' i got my camcorder out because i 'd seen on @entity141 that under no account did people need to give their details to a police officer if they had n't committed an offence but he took me to the back of the van and threw the mountain bike into the hedge and was frisking me and patting me down			1
' i said " what do you think you are doing ? "			0
he said he was searching me to make sure there was nothing that can harm me or him			2
' pc @entity157 told the court he was driving along @entity97 ( pictured ) when he saw mr @entity5 cycling towards him mr @entity5 said : ' for anyone to accuse me of being a bad dog owner it really disgusts me			1
i would give my own life before seeing my dog come to any harm ' mr @entity5 said he was later kept in cells at @entity168 for three hours			1
he added : ' the prosecution kept saying if i pleaded to a lesser charge they would let the rest go and i 'd have a £ 40 fine but my wife and i did n't think that is @entity176 justice			2
' i kept saying i was was not guilty			0
i was literally being badgered into a situation where they wanted me to plead guilty to a lesser charge but that 's not me			0
i ca n't live my life on a lie			2
' my wife has told told me to sell the bike and everything with it because she is that disheartened			0
i 'm feeling like i 've been penalised for being a law abiding citizen and trying to be healthy and keeping my dog healthy			2
' for anyone to accuse me of being a bad dog owner it really disgusts me			2
i would give my own life before seeing my dog come to any harm			1
' i was very disappointed at the verdict			0
i thought we are meant to have the best justice system in the world			0
even my own barrister said he had never come across this			0
i 've driven motorbikes , wagons , motor homes and cars - why should i be victimised for something like this ? ' a court heard mr @entity5 was close to the kerb but his dog , @entity9 ( pictured here as a puppy ) , was near to the central white line and there were a queue of cars behind him in court pc @entity157 told the court he was driving along @entity97 when he saw mr @entity5 cycling towards him			1
mr @entity5 was close to the kerb but his dog , @entity9 , was near to the central white line and there were a queue of cars behind him			1
@entity221 said : ' i had never seen anything like it in 25 years of policing			1
i stopped and shouted out of my window for him to stop			0
' there is no way a dog should be running or walking down the centre of the road , let alone tied to a bicycle			1
if there had been a reaction to a cat or a person or anything like that the consequences could have been catastrophic			0
' @entity221 said he had to run after @entity5 and take hold of his bike to make him stop			1
he said : ' he pulled out a camcorder and started filming me			0
i did n't want to arrest him and would probably have dealt with the whole matter with a caution if he had co-operated			0
' after the case @entity244 , of @entity245 ( @entity246 ) , said : ' riding with your dog may act as a visual distraction and has the potential to affect your balance			0
