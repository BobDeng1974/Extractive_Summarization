by @entity0 armchair viewers are set for a tv bonanza next season after @entity5 ’ relegation added further spice to the @entity7			1
the @entity9 ’s humiliating defeat on penalties to @entity11 confirmed they will fight it out with @entity13 and @entity14 in the second tier for the one automatic promotion place on offer			1
and , in light of sunday ’s drama , @entity18 understands that several tv companies are now vying for the right to screen additional matches from what promises to be @entity26 ’s most competitive division			0
dejected : @entity5 were relegated after the club 's heartbreaking play - off defeat to @entity11 as things stand , @entity29 are in line to screen five @entity14 games next term with @entity34 contracted to show 10 matches featuring the @entity37 club			1
however , with the added interest from the two capital clubs now confirmed , it ’s believed @entity41 have already kicked off talks about the prospect of showing 16 further matches – not involving @entity14			2
if that deal is rubberstamped , @entity45 would utilise the friday night slot already dusted down by their satellite rivals as well as showing games on weekends both live and on delayed transmission			0
that proposed deal would restrict the broadcaster to just two games per ground			0
@entity58 to maximise revenue streams however , the @entity57 have left the door open for @entity29 and @entity34 to come in and possibly extend their coverage of the second tier			0
that could lead to a bun - fight between the three companies but , regardless of who wins the day , it seems certain that over 30 second tier matches will be beamed into living rooms in 2014 - 15			0
promoted : @entity14 ' midfielder @entity70 lifts the @entity72 trophy in april on monday night an @entity57 spokesman said : ' we have regular conversations with our broadcast partners which are commercially confidential – we expect to announce the broadcasting arrangements for season 2014/15 in conjunction with them in the coming weeks			2
' the lower league deals were first thrashed out when @entity14 were exiled in the bottom tier in 2012 – initially with @entity29 and @entity82 – but the fact three giant of the @entity86 game are now in the @entity7 is forcing a rethink			1
last season @entity45 showed three live games and a further 35 on delayed transmission .			2

@entity5 , @entity14 and @entity13 will all play in the @entity7 next season
@entity5 relegated following penalty shoot - out defeat to @entity11
