by @entity0 published : 01:14 est , 9 december 2013 updated : 03:23 est , 9 december 2013 @entity1 announced sunday that new measures are in place to prevent a repeat of last weekend ’s deadly train derailment that killed four people			2
the commuter train operator said sunday that automatic speed restrictions have been installed where @entity9 sped a train at @entity12 into a @entity14 restricted curve , causing it to jump the tracks			1
the @entity18 - owned rail is also implementing other changes meant to make rides safer for commuters			0
slowly returning to normal : a southbound train enters the station as train service has begun while track and other repairs continue along the north of the @entity30 - @entity29 stop ‘ @entity1 is taking important steps to improve safety for its customers and employees , and i expect the railroad will continue searching for ways to improve its operations and fully restore its commuters ' confidence ’ @entity18 chairman and ceo @entity42 said in a statement			2
the automated speed controls installed at the @entity47 - @entity46 curve will warn engineers of the impending curve and then automatically lower the train ’s speed if the engineer does not , the agency said			1
the protections will be on all trains as of monday morning ’s commute			0
automatic speed restrictions at other high - risk junctures will be in place in the coming months , said the agency			1
additionally , conductors will stand in the train cabs with engineers as they approach sharp curves and other areas with speed restrictions			1
hard at work : @entity69 workers consult circuit diagrams , make wiring changes and test the system at @entity47 - @entity46 horrifying : the high - speed train derailment that killed four people has led the @entity18 to adopt several new safety measures this measure is likely in response to mr @entity9 telling investigators he ‘ zoned out ’ right before the sharp turn - and to federal regulators insisting last week the train operator make significant safety improvements			1
the conductors will ‘ verbally confirm all speed limits are adhered to , ’ the @entity18 said			0
in situations where the train ’s layout does not permit the conductor to enter the cab - if the locomotive is in the back of the train , like it was during the derailment – speed reductions will be verified by radio			2
@entity1 was not available to comment on whether an interim back - up plan was in place in the event a radio confirmation could not be immediately made until the automatic speed restrictions are in place next year			1
speed limits in several areas have also been reduced to eliminate speed drops of more than @entity105			0
the appropriate signage will be in place within a week			0
the train operator will also conduct more thorough speed monitoring of its fleet through review of train data recorders , having supervisors ride random trains and even the use of radar guns .			0

the automatic *braking* system forces trains to slow to @entity14 as they approach the deadly @entity47 - @entity46 curve
automatic speed restrictions will also be installed at other various high - risk places
*numerous* other safety measures have also been implemented
