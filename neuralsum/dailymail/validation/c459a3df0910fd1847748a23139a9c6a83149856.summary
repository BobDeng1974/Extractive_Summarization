the @entity0 have conducted a study into chief officer misconduct police chiefs put gifts for their lovers on taxpayer - funded expenses and preyed on young female colleagues out of arrogance , a scathing report has found			1
they saw themselves as captains of industry rather than public servants , research into a string of misconduct scandals concluded			0
a culture of entitlement meant some in the highest ranks believed they had a right to perks and privileges including gym membership , school fees , overseas travel , hospitality and executive cars			0
the report added that too many forces tolerated bullying with a ‘ boys club ’ culture that allowed misconduct to thrive			1
it was compiled as part of a @entity0 drive to improve leadership and integrity within the 43 constabularies in @entity41 and @entity42			2
academics studied the cases of 33 police chiefs , all assistant chief constables or above , who were investigated for , or guilty of , offences including financial misconduct , dishonesty , bullying , racism and sexism since 2008			1
although not named in the report , one is understood to be @entity56 , the then chief constable of @entity57 who used his corporate credit card to pay for meals with his mistress and exchanged politically insensitive and sexually explicit emails with her via the force computer system			1
in 2008 , the @entity65 upheld the allegations it investigated			0
mr @entity56 did not face disciplinary action because he had already retired			0
in october 2012 @entity68 , of @entity69 , was the first chief constable to be sacked in 35 years for gross misconduct after he lied to the police watchdog and ordered a member of staff to do the same			2
experts commissioned by the @entity0 , a professional body for police in @entity41 and @entity42 , studied misconduct investigations triggered by complaints about professional conduct made by spouses or partners when the relationship collapsed			2
other cases studied included internal probes over expenses incurred while officers conducted affairs , and inappropriate and potentially predatory sexual conduct towards junior colleagues			2
the study carried out by the @entity0 was described as the first step towards understanding how police leaders can get drawn into misconduct police chiefs were also investigated for misconduct over pay , perks , hospitality , travel and expenses , racism , sexism , dishonesty and abuses of their force ’s recruitment and procurement processes			1
one senior officer was given an executive car fitted with blue lights and sirens , even though not trained to use it , because emergency vehicles received tax breaks			2
the report found : ‘ it was clear in a number of cases that there were factors specific to particular chief officers that appeared to be relevant to their behaviour			1
[ they had ] individual weaknesses that were regarded as risk factors			0
some [ interviewees ] suggested that arrogance is a corollary of decisiveness , which is considered a desirable and necessary attribute in chief officers			0
’ the academics , who interviewed nearly 40 senior police officers and investigators , found that despite cuts of millions of pounds from police budgets , senior officers retained a culture of entitlement towards taxpayer - funded perks			1
it said : ‘ some chief officers tended to see themselves as being more akin to “ @entity144 ” than public servants – with all the entitlements and privileges that came with the ceo role			0
‘ several interviewees described a ‘ ‘ culture of entitlement ” at chief officer level			1
a culture of entitlement among some leaders had become ingrained to an extent that rendered it impervious to the changing ethical landscape associated with austerity			0
’ @entity68 , former chief constable of @entity69 , left , and @entity161 , former chief constable of @entity163 , right , were at the centre of misconduct investigations the @entity0 has a number of offices including one in @entity169 , on the 11th floor of this building it found chief officers operated in a ‘ distinctive environment that presents considerable risks , pressures and temptations ’			1
they were powerful police officers , who were often isolated and unchallenged by less senior officers			1
part of the problem was that challenging a senior officer ’s judgement was ‘ widely considered to be career - limiting ’			0
but the report said there were encouraging signs police chiefs were shifting to more inclusive and open leadership styles , which was less likely to lead to corruption within forces .			0
