an @entity1 engineer today claimed how his country managed to ‘ trick ’ a @entity3			1
drone into landing in @entity1 by electronically hacking into its navigational weak spot and ' spoofing ' its gps system			2
it 's the latest development in this extraordinary tale of intrigue , with a @entity13 report citing a 2003 document suggesting the gps weakness was long known to the @entity3 military			1
the @entity17 has been seen on display by @entity1 's gloating military after it went missing along the @entity21 - @entity1 border earlier this month - but a former @entity23 official said it seems to be a fake			1
on display : the captured @entity17 reconnaissance drone which @entity1 claims it tricked into landing in the country however the engineer working on the @entity33 drone ’s system told the @entity13 that his country fooled the aircraft into touching down in @entity1 - instead of its programmed destination			1
the engineer claimed the electronic attack made it ' land on its own where we wanted it to , without having to crack the remote - control signals and communications ' from the @entity3 control centre			1
‘ the gps navigation is the weakest point , ’ he told the @entity13			0
‘ by putting noise ( jamming ) on the communications , you force the bird into autopilot			0
this is where the bird loses its brain			0
’ the @entity13 highlighted a report in 2003 - @entity54 - from @entity55 that appeared to warn of the type of attack claimed by the @entity1 engineer			2
' a more pernicious attack involves feeding the gps receiver fake signals so that it believes it is located somewhere in space and time that it is not , ' the report states			1
malfunction : @entity3 officials claim the drone broke down , but can not explain how it was still in relatively pristine condition when found by the @entity1 ' this “ spoofing ” attack is more elegant than jamming because it is surreptitious			1
' a research paper presented at a security conference last october expanded on @entity73 ' , describing the ' seamless takeover ' of drones and other airborne vehicles using hacking			0
' the gps navigation is the weakest point			0
by putting noise ( jamming ) on the communications , you force the bird into autopilot			0
this is where the bird loses its brain ' @entity1 engineer @entity3 officials have blamed the loss of the drone , which flies at up to 50,000ft , on a malfunction , but have yet to explain its apparently relatively pristine condition after being recovered by the @entity1			1
in the last three years , @entity1 has suffered a series of setbacks in a covert war led by the @entity3 and @entity98			2
these include the assassinations of its nuclear scientists , explosions at missile and industrial facilities and a computer virus that sabotaged uranium enrichment plants			0
but the ‘ engineer 's account of how @entity1 took over one of @entity3 's most sophisticated drones suggests @entity112 has found a way to hit back ’ , reported the @entity13			1
graphic : the @entity17 was reportedly used to watch former @entity116 leader @entity115 during the @entity118 mission that killed him but a former @entity23 official , who does not wish to be named , claimed the drone looks like a fake			1
it is the wrong colour and the welding along the wing joints does not appear to conform to the stealth design that helps it avoid radar detection , he said			0
' a more pernicious attack involves feeding the gps receiver fake signals so that it believes it is located somewhere in space and time that it is not			2
this “ spoofing ” attack is more elegant than jamming because it is surreptitious ' gps spoofing countermeasures he questioned why the landing gear was covered up when displayed by the @entity1 military			2
the drone was used for covert surveillance such as the operation to spy on the @entity141 compound of @entity115 before he was killed in a @entity3 raid in may			0
@entity1 officials have said the drone came down over eastern @entity1 , hundreds of miles from the cluster of nuclear sites in the central and north - west of the country			0
they believe they can ' mass produce ' the captured drone by ' reverse engineering ' the aircraft .			0

engineer claims @entity1 downed drone by using fake signals to confuse it
claimed gps signals are easy to hack without cracking @entity3 control codes
