the @entity13 rising star - who is touted as a potential presidential candidate - declined to say whether he had smoked the herb in a direct question at an education forum			1
' if i tell you that i have n't , you wo n't believe me , ' said mr @entity9			1
' and if i tell you that i did , then kids will look up to me and say , " well , i can smoke marijuana because look how he made it			0
" ' ' if i tell you that i have n't , you wo n't believe me ' : @entity25 senator @entity9 , a @entity13 who represents @entity3 , speaking at a press conference where he dodged the question of whether he 'd ever smoked marijuana the senator 's comments came as @entity3 's lawmakers introduced identical bills to legalise the use of marijuana for medical purposes			1
it is hoped that the proposals will be passed before @entity3 voters decide on a ballot initiative in november to amend the constitution to allow for the change in the law			1
@entity42 and @entity43 , both @entity44 in @entity3 's @entity45 , brought patients and their families to the unveiling of their bill , which would implement by statute the constitutional amendment on the november ballot			1
' this bill puts patients before politics , ' said @entity55 of @entity56 , president of the @entity57 , who has lived for 28 years with @entity59 , also known as @entity59			0
mrs @entity55 , whose speech is slurred by her illness , sat in her wheelchair next to her husband , @entity63 , who read her statement at a news conference in front of the @entity45 building			0
the amendment , and the newly introduced legislation , would specify tight state regulation for doctors to prescribe marijuana for treatment of conditions like cancer , @entity76 , als and other severe afflictions			1
green goddess : mr @entity9 's comments came as @entity3 lawmakers introduced bills to legalise marijuana for medical purposes ahead of a november vote to amend the constitutional to allow for the change in law identically worded bills were introduced in both houses of the state legislature yesterday , in an effort to ease their quick passage			1
the session starting march 4 will mark the fourth year such a bill has been introduced			2
prominent @entity3 republicans , along with governor @entity96 and attorney general @entity97 , vigorously oppose a change in the law			1
allowing the medical use of marijuana - a move already taken in 20 states and the @entity104 - has been seen as a first step to ending the ban on recreational use of marijuana			2
federal law currently classifies marijuana as a @entity110 , meaning that it regarded as having a high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use			2
nevertheless , @entity115 and @entity116 have both voted to legalise the drug for recreational use under state law			2
mr @entity9 , one of @entity3 's two representatives in the @entity45 , yesterday insisted that he opposed the legalisation of the recreational use of marijuana			1
he said like most teenagers he made dumb decisions when he was younger , and he said he did n't need the help of marijuana or alcohol to further that , the @entity122 reported			2
high times : @entity131 revellers smoke marijuana during a @entity133 - era themed party at a bar in @entity135 celebrating the start of retail pot sales in @entity115 after the state decided to legalise the drug the @entity3 @entity140 has already approved the ballot language on the amendment and it will become law if 60 per cent of the voters approve it in november			1
raiding the cupboards for food is a well - known effect of smoking cannabis			0
but for years , scientists have been unable to understand why cannabis ’ active ingredient , tetrahydrocannabinol ( @entity152 ) , causes such a powerful surge in appetite			0
now a @entity157 study has revealed that people get ‘ the munchies ’ after using marijuana because their sense of smell and taste is heightened			0
a group of neuroscientists , led by @entity166 of the @entity167 , found that in mice , @entity152 fits into receptors in the brain 's olfactory bulb			0
this dramatically increases the creature ’s ability to smell food and leading them to eat more of it , they said in a study published in @entity180			0
if the findings hold true for humans , it may help develop treatments for appetite disorders by changing the link between smell and appetite			0
polls show it has a strong chance of success			0
if the amendment passes , mr @entity43 said the 2015 @entity194 will have to pass implementing legislation specifying ' how will we grow it , how will people who need it get access to it and how will those who are seeking to abuse it receive consequences ? while @entity13 leaders oppose the medical marijuana amendment , a separate bill allowing use of a non-euphoric marijuana extract known as ' @entity207 ' is also making progress in the @entity209			1
the derivative is drawn from a portion of the marijuana plant that does not get users high , but has shown results in treating seizures			0
the amendment is seen as a key driver to encourage @entity219 voters to turn out at the polls in november			1
the petition campaign that put it on the ballot was bankrolled by @entity225 attorney @entity224 , a close ally of former governor @entity226 , who is seeking the @entity44 nomination for another term as governor			0
mr @entity226 supports the amendment and political observers expect the referendum will draw more young and minority voters , who tend to vote @entity44			2
