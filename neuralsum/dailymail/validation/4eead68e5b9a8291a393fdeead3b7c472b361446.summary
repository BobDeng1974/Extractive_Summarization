@entity1 member @entity0 attended the @entity3 @entity2 a £ 29,000 - a - year boarding school will scrap all its fees this september to become one of @entity8 's latest free schools			1
the @entity9 , whose former pupils include the @entity1 member @entity0 , will become a state school – with no fees to attend			1
the boarding school was one of 49 new free schools announced by the prime minister yesterday as part of a major expansion of the policy which allows schools to be set up by community groups including parents , charities or teachers			1
an extra 500 free schools will be opened by 2020 under a @entity28 government , mr @entity8 said			1
the @entity9 is the latest of several private schools to scrap fees and take state funding via the free schools programme			1
the most prestigious was @entity33 , while others included @entity35 in @entity36 , @entity37 in @entity38 , and @entity39 in @entity40 in @entity41			0
pupils at the school who do n’t board currently pay fees of £ 13,230 – but this will fall to nothing from september			0
families of children who board will see their fees drop to a boarding charge of between £ 10,000 and £ 14,000 a year			2
the school , in grounds of 25 acres , currently has 538 pupils , of whom 139 are boarders			0
as a state school it will expand to 1,200 children , with boarders dropping slightly to around 110			1
free schools were introduced in 2010 to allow parents and community groups to set up their own schools			1
they are independent from local authorities but must still undergo @entity68 inspections			0
supporters say they help to drive up standards by creating competition with existing schools , but @entity73 has opposed their creation in areas with a surplus of places where they are not needed			0
the new plan to open at least 500 of the schools by 2020 mean an extra 270,000 places			2
in a speech in @entity83 , mr @entity8 said : ' if you vote @entity28 , you will see the continuation of the free schools programme at the rate you 've seen in the last three years			1
' that means , over the next parliament , we hope to open at least 500 new free schools resulting in 270,000 new school places			1
' remember - we 're the only party that is committed to this			0
the only party that 's opening up the education system so we can get more good places for your children			0
the @entity9 was one of 49 new free schools announced by the prime minister yesterday ' and is n't that what every parent wants - a great education for their child ? you deserve the security of knowing your child is getting just that			1
and with the @entity113 you should expect nothing less			0
' he also backed the idea of existing grammar schools			0
taking questions from the audience , mr @entity8 was asked about comments he made in 2007 that a ' pledge to build more grammar schools would be an electoral albatross '			2
he insisted : ' i have never said that grammar schools are an albatross , grammar schools are good schools and i like good schools			0
i want there to be good schools for people to send their children to			0
' what i 've said about grammar schools is , like other schools that are good , if they want to expand they should be able to expand			0
i have been very consistent about that			0
' education secretary @entity139 said she would not allow free schools to make a profit , despite the move being supported by her predecessor @entity144			1
she said she wanted each school to ' make the right choice for them ' about whether to become a free school or academy			2
@entity8 talks with school children during a visit to @entity152 for girls in west @entity83 today asked if she could rule out a @entity155 government allowing free schools to make a profit , she told @entity158 's today programme : ' yes i can rule it out , i think having for profit education is something that would make me feel very uncomfortable and it is not something that is needed			1
' we have excellent sponsors like charities and others or parent groups wanting to run schools and they are doing an excellent job up and down the country			2
' mrs @entity172 's insistence that there would be no profit - making schools for the whole of the next parliament suggests a shift in policy from her predecessor			0
mr @entity144 , who lost his job as @entity139 in july , had advocated allowing profit - making to encourage companies to set up successful free schools			2
in may 2012 he said : ' it 's my belief that we could move to that situation but at the moment it 's important to recognise that the free schools movement is succeeding without that element and i think we should cross that bridge when we come to it			2
' @entity73 has criticised the free schools policy , claiming it can lead to money being channelled to areas where there is a surplus of school places instead of being targeted at areas where classes are overcrowded .			1
