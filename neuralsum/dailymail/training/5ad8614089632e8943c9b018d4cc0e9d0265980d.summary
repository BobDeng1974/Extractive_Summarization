betrayed : @entity0 found out her husband of 13 years was living a double life @entity0 used to be thankful for her chauffeur husband who worked all the hours he could to pay the mortgage on the house they shared in @entity7 , @entity8 , after she was made redundant			1
@entity0 , 58 , believed that husband , @entity9 , 55 , often had to stay away from home as he worked night shifts and was regularly hired to drive to @entity12			1
but she was shocked to discover her husband of 13 years was not the man she thought he was			0
in fact , many of the times he had stayed away ' working ' he was actually seeing another woman			2
and @entity0 was stunned to find out he was n't just having an affair - he had committed bigamy by marrying the other woman after forging divorce papers			1
recalling the events that led to her shocking discovery on today 's @entity24 , @entity0 said : ' one of the times he told me he was away in @entity28 i became worried because i could n't get hold of him for ten days			1
his mobile kept going straight to answerphone			0
' i had started working as a carer then and by coincidence , the son of one of the ladies i looked after worked at the same chauffeur company			2
i asked him to try and contact @entity9 and he did - on a different number to the one i had			1
' @entity9 was living a double life and had two mobile phones and he was n't in @entity28 , he was in @entity42			2
' @entity0 confronted her husband when he returned home but he denied everything			2
he said his work was ' top secret ' so he could n't tell her where he had been			2
' oh so you 're @entity49 working for @entity50 now ? ' she retorted at the time			0
suspicious of what he had been up to , @entity0 later checked her husband 's emails - which she had access to , as she did his invoicing for him			1
this was how she discovered he was married to a @entity42 nurse , @entity59 , who he had set up home with less than 20 miles away in @entity61 , @entity62			1
she told presenters @entity63 and @entity65 : ' i did n't know about his double life			0
i did n't have a clue as it was happening over a long period of time			0
she recalled : ' when i first met him , i danced with him and he asked for my number			0
we got on really well and had the same interests , we both enjoyed dancing and going out , we were hunky dory			0
' caught up in a whirlwind romance , @entity0 said yes when @entity9 proposed to her a year later			1
it was only after they tied the knot that it became apparent @entity9 was prone to withholding the truth			2
he 'd failed to tell @entity0 that he had been married before and was a father			1
she said : ' i did n't know until after i married him that he had been married before and had children			0
he said if i found out he had children it might put me off			0
' @entity0 said they were happily married for a time until she was made redundant and @entity9 volunteered to start doing extra shifts , which meant he would be away from home more			1
@entity99 pictured with april @entity100 who he tied the knot with while still married to @entity0 then in 2010 , he came home and told @entity0 about a money - making scheme he had heard about			1
' one time he came home and told me about a friend who had a @entity42 nurse for a girlfriend			0
she was struggling for a visa to stay in @entity110 and he could n't ­ marry her as his ­ divorce had n't come through , ' she explained in an earlier interview in @entity114			0
@entity115 said she 's now trying to move on with her life after her ex has been sentenced for his crimes ' @entity9 told me he was ­ looking for someone else to marry her for a fee – just to keep her here			1
' i thought it was really sad that someone was in that ­ position , but even sadder ­ anyone would be ­ desperate enough for cash to marry someone they did n't love			0
' i thought to myself : " we may be poor , but i love my husband , and that 's worth a lot " '			0
' but unbeknownst to @entity132 , @entity9 went on to marry @entity42 nurse april himself in a £ 10,000 visa scam - and then he fell in love with her			2
they tied the knot at a registry office in @entity140 , @entity62 , which @entity0 only discovered two years later when she checked his email following his mysterious trip to @entity42			2
april appeared to have no idea @entity9 was still married as he had forged divorce documents to make their union possible			1
@entity0 reported his bigamy to the police in fear that she may be accused of being involved in the visa scam			1
in december last year , @entity9 admitted perjury , bigamy and making forged statements and was sentenced to nine months , suspended for 18 months			1
on this morning , @entity0 said while @entity9 admitted his crimes in court ( while the ' @entity42 lady was in floods of tears ' ) , he has yet to confess his crimes to her			1
' still to this day he has n't admitted to me what he did and he showed no remorse in court , he did n't offer a word , ' she said			0
she added that she 's now trying to ' get on ' with her life			0
' i have to start again and keep myself busy and i have plenty of friends			0
i do n't know if i would marry again			0

@entity0 , 58 , from @entity8 , married @entity9 , 55 , in 1997
he seemed to work round the clock as a chauffeur , seven days a week
but he 'd married another woman and set up house 20 miles away
he was *convicted* for perjury , bigamy and making forged statements
