@entity0 ended @entity3 ' four - match unbeaten run as his goal handed @entity5 a 1 - 0 win at @entity7			1
referee @entity8 made himself unpopular with the @entity3 crowd by rejecting three penalty claims before midfielder @entity0 pounced beyond the far post , finishing off clever approach play down the right by substitute @entity14 and @entity15			1
@entity8 quickly imposed his authority on a keenly contested affair , showing @entity5 defender @entity18 a yellow card for impeding @entity20 , who was recalled to @entity3 ' attack after his late winner against @entity23 a week earlier			2
@entity0 of @entity5 celebrates scoring his side 's first goal against @entity3 @entity27 's 25 - yard free - kick was deflected over the bar and from @entity27 's in - swinging corner @entity29 and @entity31 narrowly failed to connect			1
@entity32 should have seized an 18th - minute lead for @entity5 but after giving @entity31 the slip and sprinting through the middle into the penalty box , the @entity35 ' leading scorer had his shot blocked by alert goalkeeper @entity40			2
@entity29 was then fortunate to escape with a yellow card for impeding @entity0 when clean through			0
@entity0 's free - kick caused @entity40 no anxiety , but the @entity3 keeper needed to be quick to close down @entity45 as the home defence was exposed once more			2
@entity48 of @entity3 and @entity49 of @entity5 clash at @entity7 keen to impress after knocking at the first team door , @entity50 fashioned an immaculate cross from the right , which caused @entity18 to slice just outside his own post , @entity3 ' first penalty appeal came after 42 minutes as midfielder @entity48 stumbled after a shove from @entity49			1
the official was loudly booed by angry @entity3 fans as he left the field at half - time and on his return for the second half but , when @entity48 again went down in the box under a 49th - minute challenge from @entity66 , he again refused to point to the spot			0
@entity49 closes down @entity3 ' @entity68 during the @entity70 game at @entity7 on saturday nor was he inclined to change his stance when @entity20 became the latest @entity3 player to make an unsuccessful penalty claim just before the hour mark			0
@entity0 's 64th - minute goal had @entity3 fans chanting " one , nil to the referee " and the @entity35 ' advantage almost doubled with 15 minutes left when @entity14 smacked a rasping shot against a post			1
@entity3 ' best chance of the second half fell to @entity20 who hooked his shot wide when @entity85 's cross was cleared to him			0
@entity87 striker @entity86 left the @entity3 bench for his debut four minutes from time and there were some anxious moments for the @entity35 in stoppage - time as their defence came under siege but they held on			0
