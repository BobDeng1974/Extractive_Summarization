by @entity0 yesterday i woke to an azure blue sky , the sun beaming down on my lovely @entity5 farmhouse			1
it should have been the perfect beach day			1
we do , after all , live just five minutes from one of the country ’s most impressive stretches of sand			1
alternatively , i could have relaxed in my garden enjoying the view of the estuary , boats bobbing , and happy holidaymakers out on the water			1
because , with yet another stream of people arriving to stay , what i actually did was this : strip five beds ; put three loads of laundry into the washing machine ; scrub toilets ; dry bedding on the line ; re-make said beds ( two of which are bunks , and absolutely back breaking to put fitted sheets on ) ; dash to the supermarket to restock on food and wine ; buy flowers for the spare bedroom ; pick up dog poo from the garden ; hoover and marinade meat for an evening barbecue			1
rural idyll : @entity0 at home in her rambling old farmhouse in @entity5 on a houseguest - free morning you might wonder if i am running some sort of guesthouse establishment or , indeed , a small boutique hotel			1
well , in many ways it feels as if i am			1
we are not in the @entity56 guide and have no rosettes on the wall outside			1
but it appears we do have vacancies the entire summer and , yes , breakfast is always included			1
i am , of course , talking about the dreaded holiday houseguest			2
they come in many guises but by far the worst , and most annoying , are the ' passers - by '			1
the phone call usually comes at some point in the morning			2
i had one just last week			2
it was a family from @entity71 whom i vaguely knew through my son @entity73 ’s old school			2
' hello ! remember us ? ' the mother trilled			2
well , only just , i thought			2
' you know , we met at that @entity79 last year			2
our son , @entity80 , was in the year below ? ' by now the penny is dropping			2
' well , the thing is , ' she says , ' we ’re just passing by on our way to @entity85 and thought we ’d drop in and see how you ’re coping with @entity5 life ! ' an hour later , a car laden with surfboards and bicycles pulls up and said family of four spills out onto our driveway			2
' gosh , ' the mother says , doing a quick assessment of how large our farmhouse is			2
' we did n’t realise the journey would be so tiring			2
' before i have time to think ' what ’s your name again ? ' they have hung up their @entity104 fleeces in the boot - room and are making noises about staying the night			1
they offer to pitch their tent in the garden and promise to be ' no trouble at all '			2
but two days later they are still lingering , it ’s pouring with rain outside and i can see that the thought of moving on from us to a campsite is looking less appealing by the minute			2
guests : for @entity0 , the joy has gone out of entertaining thanks to the stream of visitors since january stressful : juggling the needs of guests with work and family life has taken its toll on @entity127 i did , eventually , get rid of them			1
but only by claiming that my daughter , @entity129 , had diarrohea — nothing like the threat of a bug to evacuate the property			2
of course , i could have put my foot down earlier			0
or simply said ' no '			0
and , probably , we only have ourselves to blame			0
back in january when we decided to up sticks for a life by the coast , the 800 - year old , grade two listed farmhouse we are now in felt like the last place anyone would visit			1
yes , we could see the sea from its remote , rural position at the top of a hill , but all the trees in the garden were horizontal from the wind , it was blowing a howling gale and i had to pick my way through numerous cowpats to get to the front door			0
i remember turning to my husband , @entity155 , and saying : ' you do realise that if we move here nobody will want to come and see us			0
fast - forward six months , throw in a heatwave and it feels as if my entire address book has eaten me out of house and home			1
in the past three months alone we have had 17 sets of houseguests come to stay			0
for it ’s a very different picture in august			0
the ice - cream van on the seafront has opened , the seagulls are no longer being flung past our bedroom window by a sixty - mile - an - hour wind and there is a definite feel of summer holiday in the air			1
oh , to enjoy it			0
but this , it seems , is the preserve of the houseguest			0
my job , as hostess , is to run around in circles providing endless meals and being a one - woman tourist information centre on hand to help with everything from tide timetables to the best place for a spot of crabbing			1
the problem is that we not only live in a relatively sought after holiday destination ( @entity198 is ten minutes in one direction , @entity201 beach twenty minutes in the other ) but we are also just off the @entity202 which , as any of you who have ever driven to the @entity205 will know , is the @entity206 — rather aspirationally labelled the @entity202			0
it is this stretch of road that every family from the @entity211 will , at some point , barrel down in order to reach the more salubrious parts of @entity85 like @entity214 , @entity215 and the @entity216			0
of course , with prices that way being so eye - wateringly high , it makes absolute sense to tag on a little free holiday accommodation either side			1
has n’t @entity0 moved somewhere down there ? i do n’t want to sound grumpy and unwelcoming			1
on the contrary , i would like to think my door is always open to friends and family and that we are the kind of relaxed , laid - back household that can absorb last minute , spontaneous guests with aplomb			1
but the reality is i have four children at home on summer holiday and a job			1
chores : constant visitors has meant lots of extra cooking and cleaning for @entity127 - and she 's not happy hard work : barbecues have become a constant feature of life and are taking up a lot of @entity127 's time i am not , despite appearances , on annual leave			1
and no. arriving with one potted chrysanthemum picked up from the nearest garage forecourt is not a sufficient offering if you are going to hang around for four days			0
and it ’s really hard work having houseguests			1
just last week , @entity155 ’s father came to stay and complained ( in the nicest possible way ) that the mattress on the spare bed was a little lumpy			0
' i did n’t sleep too well last night , ' he mentioned at breakfast			0
' i might just chill out in the garden today			0
are you barbecuing for lunch ? ' perhaps it ’s my fault and i should be more blunt			0
but instead of pointing at the charcoal and saying , ' there you go — help yourself , ' i rushed out , bought a new double mattress and stopped at the butcher ’s on the way home			0
it does n’t surprise me in the least that a recent poll found we spend £ 5 billion a year putting up visitors			1
and one in five harassed hosts find their houseguests annoying as well as expensive			0
visitors who expect to be waited on and those who make too much noise were deemed the most irritating			1
this is n’t my biggest bugbear			0
it ’s the fact that when you live somewhere that everybody else goes on holiday to , they either expect you to be on holiday as well or to facilitate their relaxation			0
the fact that i have a deadline , a garden to mow and four pairs of school shoes to purchase for september falls on the seemingly deaf ears of my @entity299 - sipping houseguests			1
all they want are long lunches followed by a snooze on the beach			0
the temptation to join them would be overwhelming if only i did n’t have to dash to the supermarket to buy dinner for eleven before heading home to prepare it			0
the end is , thankfully , almost in sight			0
i just have to wave goodbye to my current visitors to do yet another exhausting one - day turnaround in time to welcome the next lot for the @entity315 weekend			1
i was going to say i will then close ( and bolt ) my front door with a huge sigh of relief			0
if only ! but a distant relative — third cousin , twice removed — called from @entity321 last night ' for a catch up , ' and happened to mention , just in passing , that she was planning a @entity324 trip in october			0
' i ’ve heard @entity5 is quite nice in the autumn , ' she hinted			0
' do you have a spare room ? '			0

@entity0 has spent the summer *battling* with endless chores
she has endured a steady stream of guests - and is fed up
having visitors is leaving her stressed and unable to finish work
