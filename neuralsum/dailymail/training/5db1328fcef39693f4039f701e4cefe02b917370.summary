by @entity0 @entity2 ’s @entity1 has found water in the first soil sample taken from the red planet 's surface			1
the first scoop of soil analysed by @entity1 revealed that fine materials on the surface of the planet contain two per cent water by weight			1
study lead author @entity14 , @entity16 's @entity15 , said : ‘ one of the most exciting results from this very first solid sample ingested by @entity1 is the high percentage of water in the soil			2
@entity2 's @entity1 has found water in the first soil sample taken from the red planet 's surface evidence of water on @entity27 dates back to the @entity29 mission , which arrived on @entity27 in 1971			1
@entity29 imaging revealed clues of water erosion in river beds and canyons as well as weather fronts and fogs			2
@entity38 orbiters that followed caused a revolution in our ideas about water on @entity27 by showing how floods of water broke through dams , carved deep valleys , eroded grooves into bedrock , and traveled thousands of kilometers			2
@entity27 is currently in the middle of an ice age , so liquid water can not exist on its surface at the present time			1
however , the planet seems to have been warmer and wetter in the past			0
in june this year , curiosity rover found @entity58 evidence that water good enough to drink once flowed on @entity27			1
‘ about two per cent of the soil on the surface of @entity27 is made up of water , which is a great resource , and interesting scientifically			1
’ the sample also released significant carbon dioxide , oxygen , and sulphur compounds when heated			1
@entity1 landed in @entity68 on the surface of @entity27 on august 6th last year , to try and find out if @entity27 could have once supported life			1
to do that , @entity1 is the first rover on @entity27 to carry equipment for gathering and processing samples of rock and soil			1
one of those instruments was employed in the current research : @entity80 at @entity27 ( @entity81 ) which includes a gas chromotograph , a mass spectrometer , and a tunable laser spectrometer			2
these instruments enable it to identify a wide range of chemical compounds and determine the ratios of different isotopes of key elements			0
@entity92 , principal investigator for @entity81 at @entity2 's @entity93 , said : ‘ this work not only demonstrates that @entity81 is working beautifully on @entity27 , but also shows how @entity81 fits into @entity1 's powerful and comprehensive suite of scientific instruments			0
@entity1 landed in @entity68 on the surface of @entity27 on august 6th last year , to try and find out if @entity27 could have once supported life ‘ by combining analyses of water and other volatiles from @entity81 with mineralogical , chemical , and geological data from @entity1 's other instruments , we have the most comprehensive information ever obtained on martian surface fines			1
‘ these data greatly advance our understanding of surface processes and the action of water on @entity27			2
' doctor @entity14 added : ‘ this is the first solid sample that we 've analysed with the instruments on @entity1			0
‘ it 's the very first scoop of stuff that 's been fed into the analytical suite			0
although this is only the beginning of the story , what we 've learned is substantial			0
’ in the study , published in the journal @entity123 , researchers used the rover 's scoop to collect dust , dirt , and finely grained soil from a sandy patch known as ‘ @entity131			0
’ they fed portions of the fifth scoop into @entity81			0
inside @entity81 , the ‘ fines ’ - as the dust , dirt , and fine soil is known - were heated to 835 degrees @entity134			0
' about two per cent of the soil on the surface of @entity27 is made up of water , which is a great resource , and interesting scientifically , ' according to lead researcher @entity14 baking the sample also revealed a compound containing chlorine and oxygen , likely chlorate or perchlorate , previously known only from high - latitude locations on @entity27			1
this finding at @entity1 's equatorial site suggests more global distribution			0
the analysis also suggests the presence of carbonate materials , which form in the presence of water			0
in addition to determining the amount of the major gases released , @entity81 also analysed ratios of isotopes of hydrogen and carbon in the released water and carbon dioxide			1
isotopes are variants of the same chemical element with different numbers of neutrons , and therefore different atomic weights			0
@entity81 found that the ratio of isotopes in the soil is similar to that found in the atmosphere analysed earlier by @entity1 , indicating that the surface soil has interacted heavily with the atmosphere			1
dr @entity14 said : ‘ the isotopic ratios , including hydrogen - to - deuterium ratios and carbon isotopes , tend to support the idea that as the dust is moving around the planet , it 's reacting with some of the gases from the atmosphere			0
’ she said the results shed light on the composition of the planet 's surface , while offering direction for future research			0
dr @entity14 added : ‘ we now know there should be abundant , easily accessible water on @entity27			2
‘ when we send people , they could scoop up the soil anywhere on the surface , heat it just a bit , and obtain water			2

@entity27 rover found that surface soil contains two per cent water by weight
sample also revealed carbon dioxide , oxygen , and sulphur compounds
future @entity27 *explorers* may find all the water they need *beneath* surface
