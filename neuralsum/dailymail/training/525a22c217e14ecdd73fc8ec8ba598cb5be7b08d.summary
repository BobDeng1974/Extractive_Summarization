by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:30 est , 13 june 2013 updated : 07:01 est , 13 june 2013 @entity2 has been accused of encouraging groaning of a @entity5 mp every time he is called to speak in the @entity6			1
@entity8 mp dr @entity7 claims the abuse he receives across the green benches amounts to workplace bullying which sets a ‘ very bad example ’ to the viewing public			1
but analysis of mr @entity2 ’s role in the abuse reveals his frequent mock surprise at heckling from the @entity19 side and repeatedly referring him to him as ‘ the good doctor ’			1
bullying : @entity5 dr @entity7 has complained about the abuse and groans which greet his every appearance in the @entity6 but speaker @entity2 is accused of not helping with his references to the ' good doctor ' dr @entity7 has gained a reputation in @entity29 for long - winded questions and interventions in debates			1
he riled long - serving mps when he arrived in the @entity6 in 2010 by suggesting they all needed to be sent on a crash course in basic scientific techniques			0
but his every appearance in the @entity6 is now greeted with a chorus of abuse even before he has spoken			2
mr @entity2 appears to join in with the teasing			2
while he calls most mps to ask a questions simply by shouting their name , this week he announced dr @entity7 with : ‘ time for a dose from the doctor			1
' one mp today claimed mr @entity2 ’s behaviour ‘ does n’t help ’ to curtail the abuse			1
@entity7 is one of the most frequent speakers in the @entity6 , but his interventions are often long and fail to hold the attention of other @entity40			2
here is an example of some of his contributions : ' i dare say that i have occasionally done things that are “ capable ” of annoying other people in this chamber ; i am sure we all have			0
' 10 june 2013 ' if the hon. @entity63 listened more and spoke less , she would hear what i am going to say			0
' to @entity19 's transport spokesman @entity65 16 may 2012 ' a number of people said that they had become interested in politics as a result of following @entity70 and receiving tweets from myself			0
' 13 october 2011 dr @entity7 would not be drawn specifically on the speaker ’s role in the bullying , but told @entity77 the joke had gone too far			1
he said : ‘ i think it 's an example of how badly behaved prime minister 's questions are			0
‘ there are people shouting and talking in a deeply discourteous way			0
" it is perfectly reasonable to respond to what people are saying but i think the atmosphere is far too often [ about ] trying to shout down people and that 's a very bad example for everybody			0
’ he tried to put a brave face on the attention he now receives			0
‘ you have to have a bit of a thick skin			0
in some ways it 's better to be noticed than ignored			0
’ at prime minister ’s questions yesterday dr @entity7 had only got 14 words into asking @entity100 about carers week before mr @entity2 was forced to intervene to silence the wall of jeers			1
@entity104 , the official record of @entity6 debates , often records groans of ‘ oh no ! ’ from mps when dr @entity7 is called			1
however , there are some who believe dr @entity7 ’s striking appearance – he has a ginger goatee beard – and manner may rile and amuse his opponents			1
last month his local paper questioned why his contributions to @entity117 were met with such mirth			2
@entity119 , his @entity19 opponent in the city , told the @entity121 : ‘ parliamentary behaviour is quite often pretty poor and i would n’t encourage that kind of behaviour			0
‘ but , having said that , @entity7 can sometimes be a touch annoying			2
’ @entity127 mp @entity126 said that that @entity40 ' behaviour amounted to ‘ collective bullying ’ and claimed that mr @entity2 ‘ does n't help ’			1
he said : ‘ for whatever reason , people are picking on him because he 's brighter than them or because he has red hair			0
‘ before the man has opened his mouth this nonsense has started			0
it 's very unedifying , ’ he told @entity77			0
@entity7 addresses the @entity6 regular observers of @entity117 know that commons speaker @entity2 enjoys having his say			1
all he has to do is call out an mp 's name , but he rarely misses the chance to comment on the groans which greet @entity7 - which only seems to encourage them : ' order			2
it is very discourteous of the @entity146 to issue a collective groan - notably on the @entity148			0
i have called the good doctor ; let us hear from the good doctor			2
' 13 february 2013 ' i have a choice on the @entity155 between two doctors			0
let us hear from the good dr @entity7			1
' 25 march 2013 ' members on both sides are very discourteous to the good doctor			2
i can not for the life of me fathom why there are groans whenever i call the good doctor , but it is very unsatisfactory			1
' 24 april 2013 ' i call dr @entity7			1
if he can speak more briefly — he does not have to — more members will get in			0
' 21 may 2013 ' i am looking for a sharp mind and pithy expression , and i need look no further than dr @entity7			1
' 3 june 2013 ' time for a dose from the doctor			0
' 10 june 2013 ' i have no idea what more there could be to ask , but i have a feeling that the hon. member for @entity8 ( dr @entity7 ) will have an idea			1

dr @entity7 speaks out about wall chorus of abuse in @entity117
@entity2 expresses mock surprise at groans for ' the good doctor '
@entity127 mp says the speaker ' does n't help ' to curb heckling of *backbencher*
