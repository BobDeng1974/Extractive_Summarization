by @entity0 published : 12:26 est , 29 january 2014 updated : 12:44 est , 29 january 2014 @entity2 has been hailed as one of the major successes of the recession , with affluent shoppers heading to the budget supermarket in a bid to save money in tough times			1
but after the @entity13 retailer announced plans to set up in a genteel seaside town , residents vowed to keep it out - saying they would prefer a branch of middle - class favourite @entity18			0
@entity20 appeared on a list of 50 towns where @entity2 wants to open a new store as it bids to win market share from @entity26 's big four supermarkets - @entity25 , @entity27 , @entity28 's and @entity29			1
high street : @entity20 in @entity31 is known for its large number of independent shops and lack of chains spot the difference : councillors say they would rather have a branch of @entity18 than @entity2 councillors in the @entity31 town - which previously fought against the opening of its first pub - have reacted unhappily to the news , and say they will try to keep the budget store out			1
' i will be surprised if they get a look - in , ' said mayor @entity49			0
' there was a lot of opposition here to @entity25 coming into @entity20 and i am sure @entity2 could see the same			1
' i am not sure where they would find an appropriate site			0
' another councillor , who did not want to be named , declared : ' we want something like a @entity18 here instead			0
' places like @entity2 and @entity61 are doing very well in some places because people are happy to pick up a bargain			2
but it is the lower end of the market			0
' fight : councillors in the @entity31 town previously fought against the opening of its first pub resort : holidaymakers on the beach at @entity20 , which is fighting to maintain its genteel reputation the reaction from @entity20 locals contrasts to nearby @entity77 , where shoppers queued for hours when a branch of @entity2 opened last october			1
@entity20 , which has a population of 5,500 , is known for its retirement homes and independent shops , and houses there regularly sell for more than £ 2million			0
the town has a long history of battling against change - in 2000 , hundreds of people fought a passionate but unsuccessful campaign against @entity20 's first ever pub , @entity91			1
those opposing the ale house had warned if it was to get the go - ahead , it would be ' the worst day in @entity20 since the @entity97 blew the town up in 1944 '			2
retirees : a retirement home in @entity20 , whose population is relatively elderly battle : locals previously campaigned to stop the opening of the town 's first pub , the @entity107 and in 2009 , there was outrage at proposals from @entity111 to remove the town 's iconic ' gates ' - the manned level crossing - and replace it with an automated crossing			1
the town 's deputy mayor at the time declared there could be fighting on the streets which would be ' reminiscent of the @entity122 '			2
