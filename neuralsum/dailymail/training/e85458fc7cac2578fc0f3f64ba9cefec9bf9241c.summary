@entity0 is now the leading @entity1 goalscorer in history after netting during @entity4 's humiliation of @entity5			1
but the 36 - year - old striker had better enjoy the feeling while it lasts , because he might not hold the title for too long			0
in fact , @entity0 might not even be the top - scoring @entity10 at @entity11 by the end of @entity13 2018			2
unless the @entity15 - born hotshot finds the net in sunday 's final , he is unlikely to add to his 16 strikes so far			0
but @entity19 already has that total in his sights			0
@entity4 coach @entity22 praised @entity0 after the match but immediately tipped @entity19 to set a new record			1
' it really means a lot to all of us , ' said low			0
' this is a record that could be beaten only by @entity19			2
and all signs seem to point towards @entity19 breaking his compatriot 's record in future			1
1 @entity0 ( @entity4 ) 16 goals in 23 games ( 0.70 per match ) @entity50 ( @entity5 ) 15 goals in 19 games ( 0.79 per match ) 3 @entity54 ( @entity4 ) 14 goals in 13 games ( 1.08 per match ) @entity58 ( @entity59 ) 13 goals in 6 matches ( 2.17 per match ) @entity63 ( @entity5 ) 12 goals in 14 games ( 0.86 per match ) 6 = @entity67 ( @entity68 ) 11 goals in 5 games ( 2.20 per match ) 6 = @entity72 ( @entity4 ) 11 goals in 17 games ( 0.65 per match ) 8 = @entity75 ( @entity4 ) 10 goals in 10 games ( 1.00 per match ) 8 = @entity79 ( @entity80 ) 10 goals in 12 games ( 0.83 per match ) 8 = @entity83 ( @entity84 ) 10 goals in 12 games ( 0.83 per match ) 8 = @entity19 ( @entity4 ) 10 goals in 12 games ( 0.83 per match ) 8 = @entity87 ( @entity88 ) 10 goals in 13 games ( 0.77 per match ) 8 = @entity91 ( @entity92 ) 10 goals in 20 games ( 0.50 per match ) the @entity95 forward is just 24 years old , so could conceivably have three more @entity11 left in him should he play on to @entity0 's age of 36			1
if he continues his impressive current scoring rate of five goals in every @entity1 , @entity19 could have 25 in finals by the time he hangs up his boots			1
@entity19 also reaps the easy rewards of playing in front of the most powerful midfield in world football			0
@entity107 appears the natural successor to @entity109 as the game 's most technically gifted playmaker and is the key to @entity4 's @entity114 tiki - taka , which is strangling the life out of all who dare stand in their path			0
combined with @entity119 's brains and brawn , plus gifted footballers in @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 among others , @entity4 look set to dominate international football for the forseeable future			0
as @entity0 has proved there really is no better gig in football than playing up front for @entity4 in major tournaments			0
there are five @entity10 in the top 10 goalscorers in @entity11			2
@entity0 set his goals record by overtaking @entity50 - the original one - who is among the most skilful and deadly strikers ever to have graced the game			1
yet @entity0 has still managed to surpass his tally thanks to @entity4 's stunning consistency in major tournaments and a lack of injury problems			2
despite their huge strength in other areas of the pitch , there are also few rivals for @entity19 's position in @entity4 's team			2
the talented but raw @entity151 has provided a sharper cutting edge than @entity19 when coming on from the bench and has three goals despite limited game time in @entity5			1
otherwise only @entity0 , who is enjoying a last hurrah in his career , and the limited @entity158 provide scant competition for the striker ’s spot			0
start of the rout : @entity19 took advantage of awful @entity5 defending to score @entity4 's opening goal the list of superior forwards from other countries who are being eclipsed by @entity0 and now @entity19 also makes for remarkable reading			1
to @entity50 add the two greatest players of all time , @entity63 and @entity171 , and the top two currently playing the game , @entity174 and @entity175			0
then add @entity79 , @entity176 , @entity83 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity67 , @entity182 , @entity183 ... the list goes on and on			0
yet @entity0 tops the lot , and @entity19 could one day usurp his fellow countryman as the @entity1 ’s goal king			1
oh to be a @entity10 striker ... legends : but @entity50 ( left ) and @entity174 are among the greats who ca n't compete with @entity0 's record record - breaking klose : all @entity194 goals in pictures debut : @entity0 celebrates his first @entity1 goal against @entity197 in 2002 powered home : and he scored his second in the same game hat trick goal : and he celebrates after netting his third of the day netted : @entity0 scores his fourth @entity1 goal against @entity204 in 2002 @entity205 : @entity0 peels away after scoring against @entity207 during the 2002 @entity1 hitting the back of the net : @entity0 celebrates scoring his sides second goal against @entity212 in 2006 reeling away : @entity0 celebrates scoring against @entity212 in their opening 2006 @entity1 game strike : @entity0 scoring his third goal of the 2006 @entity1 against @entity218 brace : @entity0 celebrates his second against @entity218 in their final group a game in 2006 @entity224 : the forward leaping to head the equaliser against @entity80 in the 2006 quarter - final third tourney : @entity0 celebrates his 11th @entity1 goal in their opening game against @entity231 in 2010 slipped in : @entity0 scoring the opener of a 4 - 1 victory against @entity84 in the last - 16 in 2010 scourge : klose nets his first of two in the 4 - 0 win over @entity80 in the 2010 quarter - final rout : and @entity0 scored again in the game to make it 4 - 0 finisher : the @entity10 forward scored his 15th goal in finals in the 2 - 2 draw with @entity247 historic : the strike that made hm the record holder			1

@entity0 beat @entity50 's @entity1 record with goal against @entity5 in *semi-final* in @entity255
@entity0 has now scored 16 goals in @entity1 finals
@entity19 now has 10 goals at @entity1 finals
@entity95 star is just 24 and could have three more @entity11 left to break @entity0 's record
