but rather than a lavish banquet laid on by mr @entity10 , this chap is happy with a more modest treat			0
the water vole chewed on a large piece of pond weed while surveying his surroundings , a freshwater pond in @entity17			1
time for lunch ! the hungry fellow nibbles on a piece of greenery while happily perching in his home tasty treat : the vole chomps down on his food while watching the world go by after lunch , the peckish animal spotted a small island only a little way away that was in reaching distance of his pudding - some delicious berries			1
it quickly swam over and stood on its back legs to reach the blackberries before munching on them in the water			2
the vole greedily pulled down two berries at a time , leaving one by its side as it gnawed on the other			2
quite a stretch : the vole reaches up to a collection of berries from a small island in the middle of the pond in @entity17 or maybe this one ! the greedy vole seems to be having trouble choosing from the collection after enjoying its second lunch , the water vole headed back home - perhaps for a well - deserved siesta			1
@entity61 , 44 , travelled just two miles from his home in @entity64 , @entity17 , to the ponds in @entity66 to capture the amazing moment			1
he said : ' i travelled to my local ponds to take photographs of the vole in the water			2
' i got there at 7am and was prepared to stay there all day until i captured the perfect moment			0
' i was very lucky that the branch of berries was hanging over the little island so the vole could get to the fruit			0
' voles love blackberries , it â€™s their caviar , but i had to be very quiet and not move otherwise it would have scurried away			0
yum ! looking straight into the camera , the animal looks content with his find down the hatch ! the vole grasps his last mouthful in his tiny claws ' i was keen to get a shot of the vole in the water pipe and get a picture of it living in its home , ' said mr @entity101			1
' i was looking at the pipe for four hours and finally it appeared			0
i spent 12 hours in the pond and eventually left at 7pm			0
' it takes a lot of patience , sometimes it can be boring , but when i saw the pictures at home , i was delighted and it makes it all worth it			0
