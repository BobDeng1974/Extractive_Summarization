to the thinly disguised chagrin of a pitiful coven of hacks who regard boxing as so barbaric that they campaign for its abolition , @entity0 is still alive to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the most famous fight in ring history			1
@entity12 launched a week of reminiscences about the @entity14 by tweeting a happy snapshot of himself and some of his family and announcing that he feels just fine			1
not for the first time , reports of his death have been exaggerated			0
@entity12 looks on after knocking down @entity20 in the 1974 @entity14 @entity12 recently posted a picture on @entity22 with the caption : ' do n't believe the hype			1
feeling great earlier today ' @entity12 's daughter @entity25 tweeted an earlier message saying rumours of her father 's health have been exaggerated not that this inconvenient truth has prevented some critics from using the occasion to dwell on how @entity33 has silenced the most voluble athlete of all time and diminished his physical powers			1
in the awkward realisation that they would be mocked for denigrating one of the most remarkable sporting achievements of all time , they pay grudging lip service to the scale of @entity12 ’s accomplishment in @entity44 on the sweltering night of october 30 , 1974			1
then they rain opprobrium on that parade , citing medical speculation as to how the many punches he took before his astonishing knock - out of @entity52 might have damaged his brain			0
such is the hypocrisy of those who rarely , if ever , deign to take a seat at ringside yet refuse to recognise the potential of boxing for strengthening the moral character of young men ( and women ) , or their right to choose that path out of poverty			0
@entity12 was brought to @entity44 for the fight after the infamous president of @entity44 @entity68 put up $ 10m @entity12 trains in front of a captive audience in @entity71 before a cut to @entity20 's eye delayed the fight @entity12 had the locals in @entity44 chanting ' @entity76 ' , which translated means ' @entity12 , kill him ! ' of course there can be harmful consequences of absorbing heavy blows to the head			1
but those who deem the risks not worth taking are not entitled to make currency of boxing ’s most captivating moments			0
they simply ca n’t have it both ways			0
if they insist that a bright boy from the mean streets of @entity95 should never have been permitted to lace up the gloves , they have no place riding the tail of the comet he blazed across our universe			0
boxing was the making of @entity12			1
it gave vivid expression to the most compelling voice of all our sporting generations and made his face the most recognisable on the planet			0
would it really have been preferable for him to be dragged down into the criminal depths of the ghetto than to accumulate fame and fortune while becoming the champion of world heavyweight prize - fighting and the civil rights movement ? the man himself does not think so			0
@entity103 took @entity12 from the streets to make him the most recognisable face on the planet @entity12 reacts after winning the heavyweight title for the first time by beating @entity127 in 1964 @entity12 poses with @entity128 after being crowned the heavyweight champion of the world 60,000 roaring fans packed @entity71 ’s outdoor @entity134 du @entity132 for the fight			1
32 - year - old @entity12 was seven years older than his opponent and a fading former champ not expected to last more than three rounds			2
it is said that in the dressing room , @entity20 and his ringside crew had knelt to pray that he did not kill @entity76			2
450 locations in the @entity143 and @entity144 — and in some cinemas in the @entity146 — screened the fight on closed - circuit television			0
100 countries were estimated to have taken the fight , which was scheduled to start at 4.0am in @entity44 to accommodate audiences in the @entity143			2
10 million dollars was split between the two — $ 5m each — paid for by president @entity68			1
45 @entity20 first quit in 1977 and returned in the early @entity153 — winning the world title again at 45 , becoming the oldest heavyweight champion in history			1
the last time he was able to whisper in my hearing he recalled with eye - twinkling relish the dramatic turbulence of his prime years			0
but he also attested to contentment with the tranquillity of his current condition and the time that now gives him for profound reflection on his life and times			0
the @entity14 is a pillar of his momentous life			2
as was his first winning of the world title			1
those twin slayings of giants perceived as monsters came 10 years apart			0
in 1964 , he ‘ shook up the world , ’ as he put it , by reducing a seemingly indestructible bear of a man called @entity127 to a demoralised wreck			2
in 1974 he returned to defy all predictions once more by making a @entity180 of the formidable , intimidating @entity20			2
if anything , the rumbling of @entity20 was more astonishing than the @entity183			2
as @entity12 , in his first incarnation , he was a phenomenal athlete as well as a luminous mind			2
as @entity12 , deep into his spiritual conversion , he was deemed a veteran pugilist surviving on those quick wits			2
another genius , of sorts , helped @entity12 nag at @entity20 ’s psyche			1
@entity12 took a lot of punishment by methodically drawing @entity20 in to waste the younger fighter 's energy @entity12 begins returning the reigning heavyweight champion of the world 's blows with interest the promotional poster for the @entity14 by persuading @entity44 ’s president @entity204 to bestow $ 10million of his ill - gotten gains on the protagonists - $ 5m each - flamboyant promoter @entity203 provided an unusual stage better suited to @entity12 ’s multi-faceted flair for the dramatic			1
the stadium would be a hot - house of more than 50,000 spectators , all entranced by the legend of @entity0			0
the capital city of what is now the @entity215 became a captivated theatre for @entity217			0
and his electrifying impact on the local population grew and intensified after @entity20 suffered an eye - cut in training and @entity203 insisted they all stay in @entity44 for the extra month needed for him to heal			1
while @entity20 growled and grumbled in his lair , @entity12 went out to engage with the people			1
the mood of apprehension for the former champ gradually shifted into an inkling that he just might shock the world again			0
when @entity12 came into that boiling arena he rekindled concern for his well - being by lolling on those ropes and allowing @entity20 to belabour him with blows of tree - felling power			1
occasionally @entity12 peppered @entity20 with counter-combinations			1
most demoralisingly of all , he kept asking his opponent : ‘ is that all you ’ve got , @entity20 ? ’ by the eighth round he had the answer he wanted			2
@entity20 had punched himself out , so @entity12 knocked him out with a right hook of devastating precision			1
after a split - second of stunned silence , the stadium and the wide world of closed circuit television went into raptures			0
@entity20 puts up his guard as @entity12 surges forward in what has been described as ' @entity251 ' referee @entity252 counts out @entity20 after @entity12 puts him on the canvass in the 8th round @entity12 was indeed @entity0			1
no matter what followed , be it epic victory over @entity258 ’ @entity259 in similarly exotic @entity261 or subsequent decline towards an inevitable and dreadful beating by @entity263			0
there can be no certainty about which punch or punches may have triggered the shaking hands or trembling vocal chords			0
what we can be sure of is that the man himself apportions no blame to the sport which made him a king of every jungle , be it concrete , political or simply dense with foliage			0
rather he would have us celebrate the anniversary of that rumble in @entity282			0
that , and the defiance of @entity285 ’s for more than 30 years after diagnosis which appends another famous victory to his record			0
@entity12 staged three fights with the legendary @entity259 , which left both men physically and mentally exhausted @entity12 was beaten by @entity263 in his last professional fight in @entity294 , 1980 @entity12 's brash style changed the way that sportsmen behaved , although few have ever emulated his genius at 72 , there is no knowing how long his final battle might last			1
no knowing what next week might bring			0
but for the moment , like all of us who love the hard old game and respect the valour of its participants , @entity20 is remembering @entity12			1

this week marks the 40th anniversary of the @entity14
@entity12 *reclaimed* his world title by knocking out @entity20
the match was staged in @entity44 after president @entity68 put up $ 10m
critics argue that the punishment @entity12 took led to his @entity33
