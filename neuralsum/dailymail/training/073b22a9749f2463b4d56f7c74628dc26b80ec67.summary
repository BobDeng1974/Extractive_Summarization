the @entity2 1 , the first ready - made pc to ever come on the market , was created by @entity3 and fellow founder @entity12 in 1976			1

how the @entity2 1 works the eye - catching price - tag of the original @entity2 caused wild speculation as to the reasons behind selling for $ 666 - the number of the @entity39			1
but the number was classic @entity2 ; it was design for the sake of it			0
beauty for no reason other than because it looked nice			0
@entity45 once revealed : ' i simply like triple digit numbers with all the things i 'm involved with			0
the cost of making the @entity2 1 was around $ 540 or there about and we agreed on the best markup , retail price above the cost of building it , which worked out to $ 666			1
' @entity3 then tacked on the 66 cents to make it an eye - catcher price for the ads with the sale and promotion publications of it to the public			2

they cost 666.66 @entity70 dollars although buyers would have been expected to cough up extra to add a monitor , keyboard and cassette player			0
the @entity2 1 came with a tiny @entity76 memory - around 600,000 times less than is standard with today 's @entity2 computers			1
it would not even have the capacity to store one song			0
this example comes with all the original gizmos needed to make it run and is one of only six of the 46 surviving @entity2 1s still working			0
it even carries @entity12 's signature on the motherboard , and also included in the auction is a company letter signed by @entity3			2

@entity111 , owner of a retail chain called @entity111 , placed an order for 50 of the machines and sold them for $ 666.66 retail - once @entity12 and @entity3 agreed to assemble the circuit boards rather than offer them as kits			1

the main board of the @entity2 machine , which is expected to sell for £ 250,000 the gadgets comes with all manuals & certificates , making it a unique purchase the heart of the machine : the 6502 microprocessor which powered the @entity2 1 , which was chosen because of its low cost ' as with all @entity2 products the @entity2 1 was n't around long before a better model was launched , but a legend had begun			2
' the rest is history			0
@entity2 is now the most valuable country in the world and interest in their early items only increased after @entity3 ' death			2
' you could n't actually do very much with the @entity2 1			2
you had to load your program each time on a cassette and it only had eight kilobytes of memory - enough for only the most basic of word processing			0
' from the 200 built only 46 remain but just six of them are working - and this is one of them			0
' that makes it even more rare than it would be already - plus this one is signed on its motherboard by @entity12			0
