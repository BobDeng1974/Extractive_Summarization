is @entity1 right to be angry over birthday snub ? @entity1 has backed his agent @entity4 's bizarre attack on @entity5 for forgetting the midfielder 's birthday and says he will clarify his future after the @entity9			1
@entity4 cast doubt on the @entity12 staying at the @entity13 by saying the influential star was unhappy with the club			2
and @entity1 tweeted : ' my agent was trying to make a point here on my behalf , joke @entity16 seems important for me to make a statement			1
. i am going to do so			0
' @entity24 said is true			0
i will give an interview after world cup to explain			0
the agent appeared on @entity43 on tuesday afternoon , saying : ' this happened on may 13			0
' until now nobody from staff called @entity1 and said sorry			2
it was really was not right			0
it is not a little bit correct			0
' if they do n't want @entity1 , no problem			1
we can leave any moment , without any problem			0
' @entity1 had attempted to diffuse the row as he tweeted : ' thanks for all the birthday messages today			1
card from @entity5 just arrived ... must have got lost in the post			1
please do not take words that do not come out of my mouth seriously			2
judge my commitment to @ @entity5 by my performances			2
' but his later support of @entity4 will have @entity5 fans concerned about their star man 's future			1
despite a video emerging showing the @entity5 players on a plane presenting a cake to @entity1 - whom the club regard as ' unsellable ' - and singing ' @entity75 ' , @entity4 told the @entity76 : ' none of them shook his hand on his birthday			1
it 's really sick , you know			0
' he got a cake but when it was @entity36 's birthday , the president of @entity39 gave him a @entity87			1
' i do n't expect @entity5 to present @entity1 with a @entity87 , we only asked that they shook his hand and said , " we congratulate you "			1
it is the minimum they must do when it is his birthday and the squad is all together			0
fast car : @entity4 noted that @entity36 was bought a @entity87 by @entity40 club @entity39 on his birthday nice wheels : @entity4 claims @entity36 was given the car for his birthday by @entity39 having their cake and eating it : @entity101 celebrates @entity5 's title win ' it is an important human relationship to shake hands and say , " @entity75 " but nobody did it to @entity1			1
it shows they do n't care about him			2
' i hear one newspaper has written that @entity5 congratulated him from @entity113 but this is a joke			1
it is better they do n't put anything on @entity113 if they are not saying anything to him			1
' the club 's owners ate a 100kg cake after winning the @entity123 this season but when they and the players were all together , none of them shook his hand on his birthday			1
' if they do n't respect him , then easy - @entity1 will leave			1
' video : city players and officials sing happy birthday to @entity1 on the plane to @entity135 happy birthday : a stewardess brings a cake with the @entity5 crest on it playing it cool : @entity141 points out that it is @entity1 's birthday celebration time : @entity141 and other members of the squad and staff sing happy birthday to @entity1 upset : @entity1 says that no one wished him happy returns at a title celebration party speaking in @entity153 , @entity4 said : ' there is a big possibility @entity1 will leave this summer			1
what happened at his birthday means the club do n't care about him			2
' they can say whatever they want , " oh we like him but we forgot "			0
forgot ? about @entity1 ? the player who helped you to be two - time @entity123 champions ? the guy who helped you win the @entity166 and @entity167 ? ' in a normal team , his team - mates and club would at least give him good wishes			2
but when you win the title and two days later you have a big party to celebrate the title and nobody comes to @entity1 to say happy birthday , what more do you want ? ' if a player like @entity1 went to @entity179 and they won the league for the first time in 24 years , @entity1 would be a god in @entity179			1
' but at @entity182 , @entity1 is no hero			0
that 's how the club make him feel			0
he 's very upset and he started thinking about leaving the club			0
and he will leave if things carry on like this			0
' we 're not doing this for more money			0
we probably can go for less money to another club			0
if they think they can buy everything , they are wrong			0
i think these people do n't care			0
only stupid people would want @entity1 to leave			2
' high earner : @entity1 is one year into a four - year deal worth £ 220,000 a week happy birthday to you ! @entity5 posted this on their @entity113 on may 13 how sweet : @entity205 sent @entity1 this happy birthday message on @entity113 sound investment : @entity5 signed @entity1 from @entity208 for £ 24m in 2010			1

@entity1 performs *u-turn* by tweeting ' everything my agent said is true '
agent claims @entity36 was given a @entity87 super car for his birthday while @entity1 was snubbed by @entity5
@entity1 earlier joked : ' card from @entity5 just arrived , must *'ve* got lost in the post '
also said ' do not take words that do n't come out of my mouth seriously '
@entity4 says @entity101 had a ' 100kg cake ' after winning title
he also claims @entity5 showed @entity1 a lack of respect
@entity4 says @entity5 congratulating midfielder on @entity113 was ' a joke '
@entity1 could leave @entity5 in the summer after being upset by the ' sick ' *incident* , according to @entity4
however , video shows @entity5 players singing @entity75 on plane
