@entity0 has warned @entity1 he is in a fight that he ca n't win and reiterated his boast that he will settle their fight in three rounds at @entity7 on saturday			1
the pair come face to face in an eagerly anticipated rematch after @entity1 was controversially adjudged to have beaten @entity0 last november			1
and @entity1 , in an open training session in his hometown of @entity15 on monday , claimed that he will knock @entity0 out			1
he told @entity33 : ' @entity1 is banking on the fact that he 's a 12 - round fighter and i 'm not but he 's in for a rude awakening because will be a breeze			2
' when i say three rounds i 'm not talking about a three round fight			2
i do n't need to come out and empty the tank in three rounds			2
i 'm going to go out and do what i do			0
i do n't think @entity1 would even last three rounds at that pace			1
' the fact of the matter is that if @entity1 is in better shape or he does manage to withstand the punishment past six rounds then it will only get worse			1
it will get worse for him round on round as i will get faster , fitter stronger as i get more and more settled into the bout			0
' what people have misunderstood before is that just because @entity1 a lot of the time does n't mean that he works for 12 rounds			1
it does n't mean that i ca n't go 12 rounds because i knock most of my opponents out before 12 rounds			1
' and at the end of the last fight i was in far better condition than @entity1 was so i am not worried at all about conditioning and i know i can go more than 12 rounds if need be , but the fact of the matter is i do n't think @entity1 is going to go past three			1
' rematch : @entity66 will fight @entity1 in front of a sell out crowd at @entity7 on saturday evening controversy : there has been bad blood between the pair since @entity1 was deemed to have beaten @entity0 in november slogan : @entity0 had ' everything for a reason ' and the date of the fight sewn into his boots anticipation : a big crowd turned out to watch @entity0 warm up for the showdown with @entity1 @entity1 had said that he refused to be wound up by @entity0 ' psychological warfare , or even listen to it			1
but @entity0 countered by insisting that there was no such tactics employed by him			2
he was simply a better fighter and felt ready to prove it in the ring on saturday			0
he said : ' i 'm not really fussed			0
i do n't use it as a motivational tool and i 'm certainly not dependent on it in a fight			2
technically , in a boxing sense , i beat @entity1 every day of the week			0
if he wants fall apart mentally so be it , if he needs to coach himself not to fall apart then i wish him the best of luck			0
' so far in the build - up i 'm sure he has felt good at times and i 'm sure he has felt vulnerable at times but everything for a reason			0
he should always look at himself in the mirror and ask " i feel good today			0
why do i feel good ? have i been allowed to feel good ? " because nothing is left to chance with me			0
' i told him that at the very first press conference everything for a reason and we 're in fight week now and he needs to understand that his destiny is dawning			0
' saturday night is fast approaching and he needs to get himself in check , he needs to get himself up for this fight and for that , again , i wish him luck because he is in a fight he ca n't win			1
and it is not because he is not good enough			0
i am sure he is good enough but i wo n't allow him to win			0
' confident : @entity1 held an open workout in @entity15 on monday and vowed to knock @entity0 out			1

@entity0 has been working on his conditioning in order to fight *longer*
but admits he plans to knock @entity1 out in first three rounds
@entity124 is in a fight he ca n't win and *shrugs* off psychological battle
