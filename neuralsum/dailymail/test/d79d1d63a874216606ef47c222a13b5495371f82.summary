@entity0 will become the most powerful man in @entity3 cricket if he is confirmed as @entity5 ’s successor at the helm of the national team			1
it emerged on thursday that the former @entity10 captain has already held talks with new @entity13 chief executive @entity12 and is in pole position to become the new director of cricket ahead of @entity17 and @entity18			1
yet @entity0 will demand almost unprecedented responsibility if he is to head up the revolution that @entity12 and chairman - elect @entity21 have begun with wednesday ’s sacking of @entity23 as managing director			1
clearly , if the @entity13 are going to land the man who appears to be their first choice then they will have to make him a supremo with powers not seen since @entity32 ’s controversial reign in the early 1990s			2
@entity0 has emerged as the favourite for the newly created role of director of @entity10 cricket @entity0 was understood to be talking to the @entity13 about the role on thursday after emerging as the @entity39 choice the exact terms of the new position were discussed at thursday ’s meeting of the @entity13 management board but if the director is to be @entity0 then he will command overall responsibility for coaching and selection			1
@entity0 is one of the busiest men in cricket , earning close to £ 1million a year through his various media roles with the @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and the @entity54 and his involvement with sponsors and the @entity58 management group			2
if he is to give up all of that — and it would be a clear conflict of interests if he continues his involvement in an agency that represents @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 — then he will want a massive salary and ultimate control of the team			0
on the day that both @entity17 and @entity18 threw their hats into the ring for the new job , one source told @entity75 that @entity0 ’s appointment was already a done deal and that he could even be unveiled before monday ’s first test in the @entity79			1
@entity18 , who is also in the frame , stands at the @entity81 ahead of a @entity83 team photo shoot on thursday @entity0 and @entity18 both work in the media as cricket analysts and commentators ultimately the decision will be taken by @entity12 and particularly @entity88 , who is close to @entity0 and is clearly keen to implement huge and rapid change in the national team as he did at @entity91			1
the implications of the return to the @entity10 set - up of the 2005 @entity96 - winning captain would be significant for the leading figures in the domestic game			2
if @entity0 becomes supremo then there may not even be the need for a head coach and , if the position does remain , it is impossible to envisage @entity105 surviving even if @entity10 win their test series against @entity79			1
@entity0 has been a constant critic of the coach in his second coming , saying he would be better off working with young players			2
there is no doubt that @entity21 — and @entity0 — would love @entity91 coach @entity112 to succeed @entity105 , but convincing the @entity113 to throw in his lot with @entity10 will be challenging			1
@entity112 is happy at @entity115 and with his @entity117 role with @entity118			0
@entity0 , who has been an outspoken pundit , would have to build some bridges were he to take the role			2
@entity121 has often been a target of @entity0 ’s sometimes inconsistent criticisms and would be on borrowed time as @entity10 captain under him unless he scores big runs and wins lots of @entity128 matches quickly			1
@entity0 was particularly critical of @entity129 for his departure from last year 's @entity96 tour of @entity132 also , @entity0 would have to provide an explanation to @entity129 for his strongly - worded column on his departure from the last @entity96 tour with what was eventually diagnosed as ‘ situational anxiety			2
’ @entity0 said he felt ‘ conned ’ by @entity129 , who he accused of ‘ doing a runner ’ from @entity132			2
one man who would greet @entity0 ’s succession more warmly than most would undoubtedly be @entity142 , who would be handed a clear route back into the @entity10 team by the appointment of the captain he got on best with			1
if @entity142 scores heavily for @entity83 and @entity0 is at the helm of the @entity10 team then a comeback that appeared impossible just a few months ago after the publication of his bitter autobiography really would be on			1
there is no doubt that if the job description had remained the same to that of @entity23 ’s then @entity17 , who said that he would be interested in the job , would be the outstanding candidate			0
@entity17 is another former @entity10 captain who is being considered for the role @entity5 lost his job as the @entity13 's managing director of cricket @entity17 is widely respected by the @entity10 team and management but would be far more comfortable in a suit with distance between him and the players rather than in a tracksuit at the heart of the dressing room			1
the apparent moving of the goalposts , with the business side of @entity5 ’s role now disappearing , would seem to favour @entity0 over @entity17			1
the third man on the shortlist , @entity18 , remains the outsider of the trio			0
these are clearly seismic times for @entity3 cricket with @entity21 and @entity12 apparently dismantling everything created by ex-chairman @entity180 , who was confirmed in a new role as @entity13 president			1
the bottom line is , with national selector @entity186 in danger of becoming the next to follow @entity5 out of the door , the whole senior structure of the @entity10 team could change before this year ’s ashes			1
if the dominoes keep crashing down , @entity0 could be at the helm of an @entity10 team this summer with @entity112 as his coach , @entity65 as captain and @entity142 back in the team			1
and that , following 15 months of turmoil since the @entity10 team unravelled so dramatically by losing the @entity96 5 - 0 , would be truly remarkable			0
@entity18 ( @entity197 52 ) current job : director of cricket at @entity83			1
@entity201 : played 133 tests , more than any @entity10 cricketer			0
players he likes : has established a rapport at @entity83 with the out - of - favour @entity142 — says @entity3 cricket needs to be bold			0
@entity209 : @entity18 has added his name to the ring of potential candidates , and knows the job of director of cricket inside out			2
reason it might not : he ’s only interested if there ’s a clear line of accountability			0
may demand a say in selection			0
@entity17 ( age 38 ) current job : @entity52 commentator			0
@entity201 : captained @entity10 to home - and - away @entity96 triumphs			0
players he likes : a big fan of his former opening partner @entity121 , who he insists will score plenty of @entity128 runs this summer			0
@entity209 : widely respected within @entity3 cricket for taking the team to the top of the test rankings			0
reason it might not : @entity17 is still in the early days of his career as a commentator – and is enjoying it			0
@entity0 ( age 40 ) current job : broadcaster and columnist			0
@entity201 : famously led @entity10 to the 2005 ashes — and 26 @entity128 wins overall , a national record			0
players he likes : @entity65 is a particular favourite — he is next in line to replace @entity121 as @entity128 captain			0
@entity209 : @entity0 is interested in the job in principle , and is close to incoming @entity13 chairman @entity21			2
reason it might not : he may decide he ’s enjoying his media career too much to risk entering firing line .			0
