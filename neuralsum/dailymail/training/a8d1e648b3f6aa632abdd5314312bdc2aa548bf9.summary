a happier hen makes really tasty eggs			1
at least that 's the reasoning behind this humorous video of of a behind - the - scenes look at the 2015 @entity7 calendar			2
the @entity8 took on board findings from research that showed the happier the hen is , the tastier the eggs will be , and rounded up some handsome cockerels trying their hand at eggs - treme sports			1
eventually this cockerel gets into the football boots for his special sporty shot it was a bit of a try , but this character settled down and got involved in a nice rugby picture the artistic sports scenes will then be made into a special calendar for the hens down at the @entity8 farm to provide them with some special enjoyment			1
first up is the star striker cockerel , who fits perfectly into a pair of football boots			0
then it 's the rugby - loving cockerel 's turn in the spotlight , who struts his stuff , flaps his wings , and is snapped perfectly for a shot kicking the egg - shaped ball through the posts			0
it is hoped the cockerel calendar will be enjoyed by the hens at the @entity8 there were a few tense moments on the pommel horse , but this cockerel soon faced the camera and got snapped it was game , set and match for this stud , as he settled up next to the tennis ball celebrity and sports photographer @entity56 , who was involved in the production of the calendar , said : ' i 've photographed many famous people and many famous athletes			2
' it was a good day , we got some great shots of some very athletic feathered sportsmen , that should keep the girls happy down at the farm			0
' also included for the calendar is a gymnastics scene , and a tennis shot			0
skateboarding was another sport to feature on the calendar of eggs - treme sports this cockerel fancied going surfing in one of the more unbelievable scenes			1

a happier hen makes tastier eggs , research has shown
so the @entity8 decided on a cockerel calendar for 2015
theme for the calendar is eggs - treme sports ; football and rugby feature
