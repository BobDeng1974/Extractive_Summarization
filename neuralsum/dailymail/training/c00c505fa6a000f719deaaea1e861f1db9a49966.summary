healthy pint : beer is rich in calcium so could benefit your bones , and full or minerals and vitamins amid warnings that we should avoid soft drinks and fruit juice due to their high sugar content , some experts have suggested we drink only milk or water			1
but another , rather unlikely low - sugar beverage is increasingly being hailed for its health benefits : beer			1
research suggests it can help protect against alzheimer ’s disease , aid weight loss and even balance hormones – and now it ’s attracting more and more health - conscious men and women			1
a raft of female celebrities are also embracing the brew			0
actress @entity28 says her favourite drink is @entity31 beer , while supermodel @entity32 revealed recently that she washes her hair with it			2
even saintly @entity36 star @entity35 has said she ‘ ca n’t get enough of @entity37 ’			0
so what are the benefits of beer , and can it really be good for you ? a vitamin - packed pint ‘ if you analysed beer you would be amazed at how many super-nutrients there are in it , ’ says dr @entity44 , medical director of @entity45 in @entity46			1
‘ beer contains all of the essential – and many of the non-essential – amino acids			2
’ as well as these protein - building blocks and minerals including phosphorus , iodine , magnesium and potassium , beer is rich in calcium so could benefit your bones			1
a study by @entity65 in the @entity66 in 2009 found that moderate beer consumption can protect bone mineral density			2
for years @entity37 was even prescribed to pregnant women due to its high @entity71 content			0
‘ it ’s now recommended that pregnant women avoid alcohol but other people could benefit , ’ says nutritionist @entity72			2
choose unpasteurised beer for the greatest health benefits			1
@entity78 , or heating to prolong its shelf - life , reduces some nutritional value as the ‘ living ’ content is removed , says @entity84 , head brewer at @entity85 ’s			1
and cloudy beer is best as filtering removes the yeast and therefore a lot of b vitamins			2
banish the belly while high in vitamins , beer is actually low in sugar , high levels of which have been linked to diabetes and obesity			1
while a can of @entity102 contains seven teaspoons and an orange juice six , half a pint of beer contains just over one			2
‘ compared with soft drinks , it will give less of a blood sugar spike , ’ says nutritionist dr @entity105 , who last year carried out a scientific review of beer			0
‘ beer is about 93 per cent water so it ’s quite hydrating			1
’ hop on : hops have ' aphrodisiac - like qualities ' and phytoestrogen found in the plant may help with low libido in fact , moderate beer consumption may even help prevent diabetes			1
a 2010 study of more than 38,000 men in the @entity66 found that when men who rarely drank beer increased their consumption to one or two glasses a day , after four years their risk of type 2 diabetes fell by 25 per cent			0
and despite the threat of a so - called ‘ beer belly ’ , a study of nearly 2,000 regular beer drinkers by the @entity134 concluded it ’s unlikely that moderate intake is associated with large weight gain			1
‘ drinking beer increases the production of bile , which helps us to digest fatty food , ’ says dr @entity44			1
beer is a rich source of fibre – two glasses provide between ten and 30 per cent of our recommended requirement			0
@entity150 is known to help keep us full and ward off hunger			0
@entity154 @entity153 although beer drinking is usually associated with brain fog , research suggests it might help prevent @entity158 ’s			1
the disease , which affects almost 500,000 people in the @entity161 , has been linked to high levels of aluminium , but the silicon in beer may offset the damage			2
a 2008 study published in the journal @entity167 found the silicon was able to reduce aluminium uptake in the digestive tract and slow the accumulation of the metal in the body and brain tissue			0
but beware of overdoing it : a @entity178 study warned that men drinking more than two pints a day could suffer memory loss			0
beer could also help heart health			2
a 2013 study at @entity185 in @entity186 found it boosted the flexibility of the arteries			0
scientists measured the cardiovascular health of non-smoking men under 35 two hours after drinking 400ml of beer and compared that with drinking vodka or alcohol - free beer			1
while all three drinks had some beneficial effect on the stiffness of arteries , beer had the greatest benefit			0
beer can raise good cholesterol too			0
‘ the main component that helps protect the heart is alcohol , which raises “ good ” hdl - cholesterol and has other benefits , ’ says dr @entity204 , professor of medicine and public health at the @entity207			1
however , that ’s not a licence to binge			0
‘ large amounts of alcohol may cause disease of the heart muscle , ’ warns dr @entity204			0
not so bad : @entity222 beer consumption may even help prevent diabetes and researchers have found that it is unlikely that moderate drinking is associated with large weight gain @entity229 - @entity228 while red wine is known for containing the anti-ageing plant compound resveratrol , beer drinkers also get skin - boosting benefits			1
made from barley , beer is rich in ferulic acid , a potent antioxidant shown to protect skin from sun damage			0
this is also found in tomatoes , sweetcorn and rice bran , but research from @entity245 in @entity246 in 2000 suggests beer contains a more absorbable form			1
men given low - alcohol beer absorbed all the ferulic acid present against just 25 per cent absorbed from tomatoes			2
studies indicate that darker beers pack a stronger antioxidant punch			0
though it ’s not just drinking beer that health fans love			1
@entity258 uses it as conditioner , saying : ‘ i smell like the bottom of a beer barrel for days afterwards but it ’s very good for the hair			2
’ ‘ the hops in beer contain silica which adds lustre , increases volume and fortifies the hair from within , ’ says @entity265 , author of @entity266 ... without ditching the @entity273			2
to condition the hair using beer , she recommends first boiling the liquid to remove alcohol , which can strip hair of natural oils , then mixing it with extra virgin coconut oil			0
@entity282 it may not be ‘ beer goggles ’ getting people in the mood – the hops in beer are said to have aphrodisiac - like qualities			1
‘ hops are a wonderful relaxant , ’ says dr @entity289 , an expert in hormonal imbalances			0
‘ and you do n’t need much to get the benefits , ’ she adds			0
research shows that the phytoestrogen from hops – oestrogen - like compounds found in plant foods – may help reduce hot flushes , low libido and other symptoms associated with menopause			1
beer may help balance hormones in cases of polycystic ovary syndrome , endometriosis and perimenopause , according to @entity72			1
‘ the phytoestrogens help to regulate either hormone deficiencies or excess oestrogen , ’ she says , advising that ‘ half a pint once or twice a week would be ample to have an effect ’			0
@entity72 emphasises it does not work for everyone , though			0
‘ it should be tried in moderation initially to see whether symptoms are relieved			0
