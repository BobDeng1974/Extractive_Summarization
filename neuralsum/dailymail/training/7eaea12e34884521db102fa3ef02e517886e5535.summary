by @entity1 reporter published : 02:43 est , 30 may 2012 updated : 10:52 est , 30 may 2012 world markets tumbled back into the red today as fears grew @entity5 will need an @entity7 bailout			1
the @entity8 was down more than 1 per cent on doubts the nation will be able to afford to recapitalise its fourth biggest lender @entity11			1
there are also increasing worries that other @entity5 banks will also need bailing out			2
banned : @entity5 's plan to recapitalise its troubled lender @entity11 through a ¿ 19billion ' backdoor bailout ' has been rejected as ' unacceptable ' by @entity19 banking officials worries : @entity5 foreign minister @entity21 ( left ) and prime minister @entity22 ( right ) the @entity23 was nearly 2 per cent or 96.8 points lower at 5295.3 as @entity5 saw the yield on its 10 - year bonds rise to a record euro - era high of 6.68 per cent at one stage			1
this is close to the 7 per cent level that pushed @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 into taking a bailout in a sign that investors had little faith in the country 's ability to deal with its debts			2
@entity41 , market analyst at @entity42 , said : ' investor confidence wanes by the day , and it could only be a matter of time before the @entity5 government is forced to ask for financial aid			2
' the ongoing eurozone crisis was also evident in @entity47 , which saw borrowing costs rise at a debt auction , affecting banking shares on @entity52 's leading shares index			1
markets in @entity19 were also sharply lower , with @entity55 's @entity54 and @entity57 's @entity56 off nearly 2 per cent			1
in @entity52 , the uncertainty in @entity5 hit banking stocks as @entity61 dropped 2 per cent or 0.6p to 25.4p , @entity58 fell 0.5p to 20.1p and @entity62 shed 1.3p to 179.7p			1
rejected : @entity63 said it wanted to inject the amount in sovereign bonds into the bank 's parent firm , and then swap it for cash at the @entity70 's three - month refinancing window however , there was good news for the government as its borrowing costs fell to an all - time low of 1.73 % as investors sought a safe - haven			1
the tumble came as @entity5 's plan to recapitalise its troubled lender @entity11 through a € 19billion ' backdoor bailout ' was rejected as ' unacceptable ' by @entity19 banking officials			1
@entity63 said it wanted to inject the amount in sovereign bonds into the bank 's parent firm , and then swap it for cash at the @entity70 's three - month refinancing window			1
this would , it said , avoid the need to raise the money on bond markets			0
@entity5 's woes , combined with growing uncertainty about whether @entity31 will remain in the eurozone , has reignited the 17 - nation currency bloc 's debt crisis on nervous financial markets , prompting calls for more radical @entity7 action			1
@entity98 president @entity97 called yesterday for @entity19 leaders to agree on a path to full economic union to reassure investors about the future of the euro area			2
he said : ' it is very important , even if you believe that it does n't come immediately , to define the trend , the objective			0
' it is very important also in terms of confidence for the investment in the euro area now			0
' we will support an ambitious and structural approach which should include a roadmap and a timetable for a full economic and monetary union in the euro area			0
' but , a major survey released yesterday showed support for @entity19 integration has fallen sharply across the 27 - nation @entity7 since the debt crisis began			1
it has raised doubts about the political will for closer economic union			0
but the @entity70 said a proper capital injection was needed for the country 's fourth largest banking institution , reports the @entity132			1
and it added that the plans could breach an @entity7 ban on ' monetary financing '			1
policymaker @entity136 added : ' it is up to national governments to help banks			0
' @entity141 , equity analyst at @entity142 , said : ' we have seen that the @entity144 and the @entity145 have made substantial moves in terms of recapitalising their banks			0
' the difficulty is , the longer you leave it , the more difficult fund raising becomes and that 's what @entity5 is finding now			2
' there have been some requests for the bailout fund to be used to help @entity5 banks to recapitalise , but the difficulty for the @entity70 ( @entity70 ) is to know where that stops			1
' there are a lot of people who would even question whether the bailout fund is big enough to rescue @entity5			0
' @entity5 will now issue new bonds to fund it ailing lenders and indebted regions			2
foreign minister @entity21 said it would nurse hundreds of billions of euros worth of toxic assets from a 2008 real estate bust without international help			0
but there are fears the move will dent the country 's strong liquidity position and further worsen public finances under scrutiny from investors and @entity19 officials			1
it could also weigh on the capacity of the state to finance itself			0
@entity5 has already completed more than 55 per cent of its debt issuance for the year and has at least € 20billion euros in its coffers			2
that is on top of more than € 4billion still available in the bank restructuring fund , making it possible to recapitalise the ailing lenders and repay debt			0
however , the central government and regions still have to refinance € 98billion out of € 117.5billion of debt maturing in 2012 and fund a deficit of € 52billion			0
the next three months , with € 38billion to refinance by august , and a second hump in october , when € 28billions is due , will be especially difficult			0
the funding situation is also growing tense in the autonomous regions , with € 12billion of debt maturing in the last quarter , more than half of it in the two most - indebted regions , @entity203 and @entity204			0
in the latest sign of tensions within @entity5 over the state of the economy and the banks , @entity206 governor @entity205 announced yesterday he would step down on june 10 , one month earlier than the end of his mandate			2
prime minister @entity22 has said repeatedly - most recently on monday - his government does not need outside financial help , but most economists disagree			0
' the point about @entity5 is it 's going to need some external support of some form , ' said @entity220 , chief @entity19 financial economist at @entity221			1
' whether that implies the @entity70 buys bonds ( in the secondary market ) or moves lock , stock and barrel to quantitative easing over the next three months , certainly the situation at the moment is not sustainable			2
' @entity5 has been on an austerity drive to improve its finances but this had deepened a recession and worsened unemployment now affecting a quarter of the workforce and led to protests			0
retail sales slumped by 9.8 per cent on the year in april , the biggest fall since the series began in 2003 .			0

@entity63 planned to inject cash in sovereign bonds into @entity11 's parent firm
