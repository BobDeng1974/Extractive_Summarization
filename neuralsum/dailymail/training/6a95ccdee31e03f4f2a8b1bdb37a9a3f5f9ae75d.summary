‘ it was a shame as we would have like to have tried him over a mile before the @entity77			0
after the @entity72 , we thought he was a mile and a half horse but he has got stronger and quicker as he has got older and they just have not been going quick enough in his races			0
‘ we hope dropping back to a mile will be the key to him			0
