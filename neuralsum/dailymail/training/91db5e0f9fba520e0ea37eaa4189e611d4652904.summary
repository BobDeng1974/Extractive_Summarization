by @entity0 @entity1 : 18:28 est , 31 december 2013 @entity2 : 18:30 est , 31 december 2013 lavish expenses : @entity4 was criticised during the expenses scandal for charging taxpayers for the cost of fixing the @entity8 at his constituency home a backlash over the new year honours list was growing last night after it emerged a knighthood has been given to a @entity16 mp who once claimed expenses for having his @entity8 cooker serviced			1
it comes after @entity19 was yesterday accused of ‘ cronyism ’ for handing gongs to conservative donors , friends – even the woman who runs his supper club			1
during the expenses scandal @entity4 , who received a knighthood for political and public service , was also criticised for switching the designation of his second home from @entity32 to @entity33 , which allowed him to claim £ 3,000 for redecorating his flat in the capital			2
he charged taxpayers £ 5,000 for decorating and repairs on his constituency home , including the £ 53.71 cost of having his @entity8 fixed			2
he also claimed nearly £ 1,000 for two china tea sets			2
he has always denied any wrongdoing over his expenses and ‘ flipping ’ the designation of his home			2
sir @entity4 said he will stand down at the next general election			2
last night mps and peers accused mr @entity19 of looking after a ‘ privileged few ’ , while failing to recognise the true spirit of the honours list			1
shadow minister @entity52 said : ‘ @entity19 stands up only for a privileged few			1
his mates and millionaire donors get honours and tax cuts while everyone else is left to pick up the tab			1
’ and @entity61 peer @entity59 said : ‘ @entity62 should be for the unsung heroes of our communities , not for outgoing mps who are power - laden with their index - linked pensions			1
’ yesterday mr @entity19 was heavily criticised for handing out honours to friends and associates , such as pr supremo @entity71 with whom he went on holiday in 2008			1
@entity74 ’s obe for services to business in the @entity77 raised eyebrows because he has given £ 31,000 to @entity80 ’s constituency party , and another £ 10,000 to the @entity81			2
and @entity82 , chairman of the @entity84 ’s supper club and former deputy chairman of the same association received an mbe for voluntary political service			0
other gongs causing controversy last night included a knighthood for services to politics and the public for @entity95 , a @entity97 mp and chairman of the @entity99			1
in 2012 , he was found to be claiming £ 1,500 in expenses to rent a family home belonging to shadow cabinet minister @entity102 , after selling his own flat for a £ 500,000 profit			0
mr @entity95 said at the time that although the rental agreement was within the rules , ‘ in retrospect it would have been better not to have rented off a colleague ’			0
meanwhile @entity16 mp @entity110 , who is also standing down in 2015 , received a knighthood for parliamentary and public service			1
however in november , it emerged that he was paying @entity115 £ 6,000 a year to use its office as his constituency headquarters – a controversial arrangement that some criticise as a means of gaining extra funds for party activities			0
their honours mean that the prime minister has now handed out knighthoods to 11 male @entity16 mps , but he has only made one female @entity16 mp a dame , @entity131			1
former cabinet ministers @entity132 and @entity134 were both overlooked			0

she said : ‘ there is a case for opening up the process a bit and explaining a bit more how the system works			0
’ it also emerged that a former conservative campaigns officer has also been put in charge of public appointments			0
but @entity156 ’s former role at @entity16 hq has alarmed @entity97 , who claim it could lead to @entity81 getting honours and jobs on powerful quangos			1
lobbying transparency campaigner @entity162 said : ‘ @entity156 ’s been a lobbyist			0
this job needs someone impartial			0
it does not bode well			0

he was embroiled in 2012 ’s rate - fixing libor scandal after he was forced to deny claims he had ‘ leaned on ’ @entity172 to lower its rate after pressure from @entity175 .			0

mps and peers accuse *pm* of looking after the ' privileged few ' with honours
