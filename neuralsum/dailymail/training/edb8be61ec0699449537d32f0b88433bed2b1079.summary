the patient claimed when he tried to finish the relationship @entity9 bombarded him with calls and texts until he destroyed his mobile phone to avoid contact from her			1
the panel heard @entity9 went on to take sick leave leading to her case load being re-allocated , which eventually resulted in claims of their relationship emerging			2

@entity9 was not present and not represented at the hearing in central @entity81 last week , but had denied the allegations			2

the panel accepted evidence given by @entity28 that @entity9 left voicemail messages on his phone saying words to the effect of : ' if you do not come and see me now then you will never see me again ' , and ' i will end the relationship and you will be alone because you will never see me again '			2

striking her off , it said her failings were ' significant departures ' from the standards expected			0
' by placing her own needs above the needs of @entity28 , ms @entity9 breached the fundamental tenets of the profession and the panel is of the view that to allow her to continue practising would fail to protect the public , and undermine public confidence in the profession and in the @entity42 as a regulatory body			0
