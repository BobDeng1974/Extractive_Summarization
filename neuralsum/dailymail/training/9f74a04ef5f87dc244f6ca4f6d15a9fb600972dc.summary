' the weather came from all four parts of the sky			2
i could see @entity39 from where we were , but i could not beat the weather			2
' @entity42 started coming into the boat and then a wave came and threw us out			1
i had a searchlight in the pants and it did n’t fall out so i grabbed and tried to look for @entity47 , because we got thrown in two different directions			2
' when i saw him , he was going under and so i swam to him , grabbed him and put him on top of the boat , ' he said			1
the pair spent the next eight days adrift , taking turns sleeping for a couple of minutes at a time , sucking on seaweed to survive and praying someone would see them			2
' we were having conversations with people that were not there , pretending to eat food , we knew we did n’t have , we were just losing it , ' @entity7 explained			1
' it got so bad that around day six @entity47 jumped in the water and said to me " i ’m holding you back , you can survive without me "			2

pray from your heart not from your belly , ' he said			0
