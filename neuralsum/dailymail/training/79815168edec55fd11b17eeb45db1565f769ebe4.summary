@entity1 is less able to keep track of its visitors than @entity4 , it was claimed last night , as a scathing report exposed the failings of official immigration statistics			1
crucial estimates of arrivals from overseas rely on random interviews carried out with just 12 people passing through ports and airports each day – and even they may be lying , mps said			1
ministers were warned they should not base their controversial immigration target – to limit population growth to the tens of thousands every year – on such shaky figures			1
failings : the risk of error in the random interviewing system is so great that annual migration could be 35,000 higher or lower than is estimated the @entity24 urged the @entity25 to combine its visa figures with forthcoming electronic data on visitors to build up a far more accurate picture of foreigner numbers			1
committee chairman @entity31 said : ‘ most people would be astonished to learn that there is no attempt to count people as they enter or leave the @entity1			1
‘ they are amazed when they are told that the government merely estimates that there are half - a - million immigrants coming into the @entity1 each year			1
’ @entity40 , leader of @entity41 , said : ‘ when i gave evidence to this committee i said @entity4 has better technology to keep track of its visitors than we do			1
i ’m pleased this report accepts the current system is a blunt instrument which is patently not up to the job			0
’ the @entity52 vowed to cut net migration – the number of new arrivals each year minus those who leave the country – from more than 150,000 a year to the ‘ tens of thousands ’ by granting fewer visas to foreign students and making it harder for families to settle here			1
unimpressed : councillor @entity40 said ' @entity4 has better technology ' but today ’s report reveals that the policy and the figures are not based on methodically counting everyone who arrives in the country or leaves it			1
instead , officials rely on a sample of just under 5,000 migrants interviewed each year as they travel through @entity1 air and sea ports , in what is known as the @entity75			1
the risk of error in this poll is so great that annual net migration could be 35,000 higher or lower than is estimated			0
some advisers believe that , as a result , the government should aim to reduce net migration to 50,000 rather than 100,000 in order to achieve its goal			1
but the committee warned : ‘ the government should not base its target level of net migration on such an uncertain statistic as doing so could lead to inappropriate immigration policy			1
’ the passenger survey also relies on immigrants telling the truth about where they have come from and where they plan to settle			0
a new system called @entity98 will record more detail on the identity of passengers travelling through @entity1 ports			1
but it will not be integrated into immigration statistics until 2018			0
the @entity25 counts the number of visas issued and asylum applications granted or received – but not people leaving unless they have broken the rules			0
the committee urged ministers to integrate visa figures with port data ‘ as rapidly as possible ’			1
last night a @entity25 spokesman said : ‘ we disagree with the report ’s conclusions			2
@entity87 reforms on immigration are working and the statistics show that migration is at its lowest level for a decade			0
’ oddly quiet : shadow home secretary @entity123 @entity123 has been criticised by @entity124 for refusing to condemn a controversial new poster campaign telling illegal immigrants to ‘ go home ’			2
ethnic minority mps in the party say ms @entity123 , the shadow home secretary , was asked to speak out but declined			0
they said it was ‘ embarrassing ’ that attacks on the campaign were then led by @entity135 ’s @entity134 , who described the posters as ‘ nasty and unpleasant ’			2
@entity124 also accused ms @entity123 , below , of making a ‘ misguided ’ attempt to ‘ pander to the @entity138 ’			2
the giant billboards , which are being driven around on the back of vans , say : ‘ in the @entity1 illegally ? go home or face arrest			1
’ illegal immigrants are offered a number to text for ‘ free advice and help with travel documents ’			1
reaction from the @entity149 , backbench @entity124 and @entity135 was swift and critical			0
but ms @entity123 remained quiet			0
one labour mp said last night : ‘ we hoped she would come out strongly against this nasty campaign , but she did n’t want to			2
‘ it is ridiculous if we are so worried about alienating right - wing voters that we end up being outflanked on the left by @entity134 , the most right - wing party leader , in a misguided attempt to pander to his supporters			2
’ @entity149 president @entity149 condemned the billboards as the ‘ politics of division ’			2
and mr @entity134 , who campaigns on an anti-immigration ticket , said : ‘ i think the tone of the billboards is nasty , unpleasant , @entity165			2
’ a @entity167 spokesman insisted that one of ms @entity123 ’s frontbench team had criticised the poster campaign			0
taxpayers are shelling out £ 21 million a year to fund interpreters for @entity174 hospital patients who can not speak @entity176 , @entity177 has discovered			0
the amount has shot up by 50 per cent – £ 7 million – in just five years , according to figures obtained under the @entity180			0
five years ago each hospital trust was on average spending £ 87,000 on interpreters , but by last year that had grown to £ 130,000			0
large - scale immigration from @entity186 countries , in particular @entity187 , appears to have driven the massive demand for interpreters			0
@entity189 , vice-chairman of pressure group @entity190 , said : ‘ i am a first - generation immigrant myself			0
those arriving here need to make much more of an effort to learn the language			0

councillor @entity40 from @entity41 told the government : ‘ @entity4 has better technology to keep track of its visitors '
