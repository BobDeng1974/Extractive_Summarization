film fans are being charged an extra £ 1 a ticket to see the latest blockbusters			1
the @entity4 cinema chain has imposed the surcharge on @entity7 movies including @entity8 and the third in the @entity10 series			1
it says the £ 1 extra is part of its ‘ dynamic pricing ’ policy			1
at the @entity4 in @entity35 upon @entity36 , @entity37 , the adult price to see @entity8 , starring @entity38 and @entity39 , is £ 11.50 , or £ 9.30 for a teen and £ 8.75 for a child			2
but they would all pay £ 1 less for popular @entity20 films such as @entity44 , starring @entity45 , or mr @entity46 , starring @entity47 , at the same cinema			1
similarly , the price for a family of four going to see @entity51 : @entity52 1 , starring @entity53 , would be £ 35 in @entity35 , £ 4 more than they would pay to see the @entity20 films			2
the @entity4 ’s policy appears to be driven by demand			0
like other cinemas , it already charges much more to watch a film in some parts of the country , particularly the @entity37 , than in others			1
like other cinemas , @entity4 already charges more to watch a film in some parts of the country for example , at the @entity4 in @entity69 a family of four would pay only £ 18 to see @entity8 and @entity51 – around half what they would have to pay in @entity35			1

' however this extra £ 1 will be dropped from the films after a few weeks of release			1
’ @entity102 , @entity20 boss of @entity103 – the studio behind the @entity10 franchise – said it was right to charge more to see @entity108 blockbusters – which cost hundreds of millions to make – than for cheaper @entity20 movies			0
