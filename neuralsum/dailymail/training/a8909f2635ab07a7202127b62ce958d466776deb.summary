a former lord chancellor has criticised police for ‘ inappropriately ’ misusing controversial anti-terror powers to spy on journalists			1
@entity4 lashed out at police chiefs who defended the dubious practice of using snooping legislation to identify reporters ’ sources			1
he clashed with @entity10 , ex-chief constable of @entity11 , who insisted there were ‘ higher concerns ’ than protecting whistleblowers who spoke to the media			0
former lord chancellor , @entity4 , pictured , criticised the police 's excessive use of ' snooping laws ' mr @entity10 , until recently the media lead at the @entity22 , said constabularies had used the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) ‘ entirely properly ’			1
the row deepened after it emerged two police forces used the powers to obtain phone records from the @entity29 and @entity31 journalists to work out who they were speaking to , in once case sidestepping a judge ’s agreement to protect a confidential source			1
home secretary @entity37 has ordered a review into how the powers are being used amid widespread concerns officers are bypassing legal protections			0
the surveillance watchdog , sir @entity43 , is also holding a ‘ full inquiry ’ into officers potentially misusing @entity24 by ordering telecommunications companies to hand over call logs belonging to newspapers			1
the powers require only that a request be approved by a police officer of superintendent rank or above – effectively giving forces the right to sign off their own warrants			0
it is claimed officers used @entity24 because other laws governing investigations require officers to go before a judge to make the case for seizing journalistic material			1
@entity4 , a member of the @entity63 which brought the powers , said the review by sir @entity43 , the interception of communications commissioner , should state that when identification of journalistic sources was an issue , police must seek the permission of the courts			1
it has emerged that the police secretly obtained phone records of a @entity31 reporter while they were preparing a prosecution against former @entity78 government minister @entity78 , pictured he told @entity89 ’s today programme : ‘ there are provisions in other legislation which say where there ’s an issue about identifying a journalistic source , the application for that material should go before a judge so the judge can balance the public interest in making sure there ’s a proper investigation against a need to protect journalistic sources			1
‘ going and using @entity24 involves no such balance - the police can authorise it themselves so nobody ever considers the balance of , for example , protecting sources			2
’ @entity4 said that neither case involved any ‘ degree of urgency ’ by the police and in one of the cases the judge had taken ‘ great steps ’ to ensure the identity of a source was concealed			1
he said : ‘ it does look this is not a proper use of the powers			0
’ he accepted proper safeguards should have been included to protect journalists and their sources when @entity24 was first introduced in 2000			2
but mr @entity10 said he believed police had been using the legislation ‘ entirely properly when you look at the seriousness of the cases they were dealing with			0
’ former @entity11 chief constable , @entity10 , pictured , defended the practice of the police secretly inspecting the phone records of journalists claiming justice needed all information to come out he said : ‘ it ’s about dealing with serious crime that the police forces were in this particular case using the legislation properly and making sure that all the evidence available comes out for victims and for the accused to make sure that nothing is secret , nothing is kept away from the judicial process			2
‘ whilst i totally respect the need for journalists to protect their sources and their informants but there are other higher needs for justice to make sure all information comes out , it should n’t be secret , it should n’t be hidden away			0
’ last month it emerged the @entity151 used @entity24 powers to obtain telephone records from @entity29 newspaper ’s newsdesk and those of its political editor , @entity157 as part of the @entity160 inquiry			2
the records were used to uncover who told the newspaper about claims @entity164 , the then chief whip , described officers as ‘ plebs ’ after they refused to allow him to cycle through the gates of @entity171			0
then , last week , it emerged police investigating the @entity78 speeding points scandal secretly obtained the phone records of journalist on the @entity31 – the @entity178 ’s sister paper – and one of his sources for the story , even though a judge had agreed that the source could remain confidential			0
@entity184 also used @entity24 to find out who spoke to @entity186 , the mail on sunday news editor working on the story , and his source , freelance journalist @entity190 , who was given the story by @entity193			0
police and the security sources obtained communications records under @entity24 more than 514,000 times last year , nearly 10,000 a week .			0

@entity4 claimed police were misusing stronger anti-terror laws
he said the legislation was not intended to allow ' spying ' on journalists
@entity4 expressed concern over the *growth* in surveillance powers
police prefer using @entity24 as they do not need a judge 's approval to spy
