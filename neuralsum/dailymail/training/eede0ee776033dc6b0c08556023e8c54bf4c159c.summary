' nearly a week later , i can still taste his blood in my mouth from when i and my comrades breathed into his lungs for 20 long minutes while we waited for a response from the authorities			2
' this soldier ’s name was sergeant first class @entity12 , and his sacrifice loaned me the rest of my life to tell this story			2

response : @entity15 , who was battling mental illness , shot dead three people and wounded 16 others with a recently purchased pistol before turning the gun on himself at @entity5 on wednesday however , @entity8 uses his letter not to simply praise his fallen comrade but to call for the repeal of regulations that disarm military personnel on military bases			1
' but i write to you today not to memorialize this brave soldier , nor to tell a war story about how we made the best of a losing situation , but to express the part of that story that some in high positions of power clearly do not want told : i knew this was going to happen , ' he wrote			2
' i had been saying for five years that @entity5 was a tinderbox of another massacre waiting to happen			0
' it had to happen , because our betters failed to learn the obvious lesson of five years ago			0
worse yet , i know it will happen again			0
' more will die , more will be wounded , more families will be torn apart , needlessly			0
it happened again , and will happen again , because @entity5 is a gun free zone			0

' ' as the shooter kicked at the door , i remember telling myself , ‘ oh well , this is it			0
’ it is beneath human dignity to experience the utter helplessness i felt that day			0
i can not abide the thought that anyone should ever feel that again , ' he said			0
@entity8 also said that another massacre will happen if things are not addressed and do not change			2
' it happened again , and will happen again , because @entity5 is a gun free zone , ' he said			0
' to those of you who hold elected office , if you hear nothing else i have told you , hear this : you have the power to stop the next massacre from happening			0
' you have an opportunity to restore the sacred @entity165 to bear arms , which has been either stripped entirely or unjustly relegated to the poor substitute of a probationary , government - issued privilege			0
for @entity20 ’s sake , do the right thing			0
