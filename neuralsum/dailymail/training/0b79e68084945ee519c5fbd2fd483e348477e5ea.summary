by @entity0 published : 05:21 est , 1 may 2012 updated : 05:25 est , 1 may 2012 to most people it was just a rusty old banger			0
but now the world ’s oldest original @entity3 , that was found in a duty barn covered i chicken feathers , has sold for more than £ 40,000			1
the ‘ classic ’ motor was the eighth to be made when it rolled off the production line in 1959			1
but it had fallen into a decrepit state after it being bought by its last owner in 1986 and is in need of major restoration			0
@entity17 : the grey paint work on the @entity3 is still visible in place , but the car is still far from roadworthy despite its condition , the @entity21 generated huge interest when it came up for auction last month			1
the car sold at an acution by @entity27 at the @entity28 in @entity29 yesterday for £ 40,250 - nearly three times its pre-sale estimate of between £ 12,000 and £ 15,000			1
the price is also an 8,000 per cent increase on the £ 497 the car cost new in 1959 , and more than double the cost of a new @entity3 today			1
it was bought by a @entity38 - based @entity3 enthusiast			2
@entity39 : the basic design is a far cry from modern luxuries such as air conditioning and electric windows @entity45 , from @entity27 , said : ' this is a wonderful opportunity to buy the car and restore it			2
it is the oldest unrestored @entity3			1
' collectors love the fact it has had very little done to it since it was built			0
it was the eight to be produced and is the fourth oldest that survives			1
' the @entity3 is one of the most important cars of the 20th century			2
they have always been collectable			0
' some collectors would want to return her to new , but others would just like to get her going again and keep her in the original condition			0
' the basic car has a 848cc engine that has done a grand total of 30,000 miles but now does n’t work			2
workings : the @entity3 was designed in the 1950s at a time of fuel shortages and its engine is just 848cc it has never been touched apart from a few running repairs during its life and is the oldest unrestored @entity3 in existance			1
through the rust it is possible to glimpse the original @entity77 grey paintwork , and it retains the original registration plate : @entity79 27			0
the interior is basic , but has all the original features including its only dashboard instrument - a speedometer			0
it was built in july 1959 at @entity85 , @entity86 , three months before the model went into full production			2
it was then sent to @entity90 in @entity91 , @entity92 , where it was first sold			0
the vehicle was bought by a @entity94 in 1986 from a @entity95 of @entity96 , @entity97 , in @entity98			0
mr @entity94 kept it in a garage in @entity101 , @entity98 , until last year			0
at the same sale a @entity104 convertible car owned by @entity106 @entity105 while the band were based in the south of @entity109 for tax reasons , sold for £ 37,950 pounds			2
glory : despite its run down condition the @entity3 retains many of the features that made it such an influential car it is thought that only three @entity3 earlier than this one exist today , but they have all been restored over the years			1
one is at the @entity117 in @entity86 , and the other two are in private collections in @entity120			0
in 1999 the @entity3 was voted the second most influential car of the 20th century , behind the @entity122 its design came about because the @entity124 meant that the country was short of petrol , and smaller cars were required .			1

the @entity3 first rolled off the production line in 1959
it was the eighth to be produced and is the fourth oldest that survives
the car cost just £ 497 when new but has *soared* in value by 8,000 per cent
