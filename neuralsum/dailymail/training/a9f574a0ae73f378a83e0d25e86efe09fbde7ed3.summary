by @entity1 reporter published : 05:48 est , 11 march 2014 updated : 11:47 est , 11 march 2014 @entity3 are to vote on whether to change their national flag , with many including the country 's prime minister wanting to see it replaced with the silver fern symbol used by the @entity11 rugby team			1
prime minister @entity12 today announced plans to hold a referendum within three years , receiving the backing of his political opponents who said they would follow through with plans even if they oust @entity12 in this year 's national elections			0
the current flag depicts the @entity21 star constellation and includes @entity23 's @entity22 in the top left corner			1
the current @entity3 flag , left , and the silver fern symbol of the @entity11 rugby team , right many complain it is too similar to @entity31 's flag and does n't reflect @entity3 's independence from former colonial ruler @entity23			1
but many who have served in the military oppose a change			0
and among those advocating a change , there 's plenty of debate about a replacement			0
@entity12 said he favours a silver fern set against a black background , an image that 's popular among sports teams			1
some say that would equate the country too much with its sporting heroes and would be too reminiscent of a pirate ensign			0
some argue the country 's indigenous @entity53 should be represented in any new flag			2
@entity3 prime minister @entity12 said he favours a switch to the silver fern in a speech on tuesday , @entity12 said the flag represents a past era			1
' the flag remains dominated by the @entity22 in a way that we ourselves are no longer dominated by the @entity23 , ' he said			2
he said @entity67 's 1965 decision to embrace a distinctive maple leaf design was a good example , and he could n't imagine @entity67 now wanting to go back to their old @entity22 flag			1
' we should be represented by a flag that is distinctly @entity3 's , ' said @entity12 , adding it would not signify an end to the @entity77 nation 's constitutional ties to the @entity23 monarchy or participation in the @entity81 group of countries			1
@entity83 , president of the @entity84 ( @entity84 ) , said he 's proud of a flag that represents more than 100 years of tradition			0
' the view of the @entity84 is there is no need to change the flag , ' he said			0
' thirty - two thousand @entity3 have given their lives under the flag and many more thousands have served under it in a combat environment			2
' the @entity96 of @entity3 , which advocates an end to recognizing the @entity23 monarch as @entity3 's head of state , remains indifferent			1
' we realize there is momentum to change the flag , and we are not against it , ' said the movement 's chairman , who goes by the single name @entity108			0
' but the substance is changing the head of state			0
it 's symbolic only to change the flag			0
' yet for many , a new flag would represent another small step by @entity3 toward disentangling itself from its @entity23 past			2
the silver fern is the proud symbol of the all conquering @entity11 rugby team in 2004 , for instance , the country established a @entity121 to replace @entity23 's @entity122 as the final court of appeal			1
recent opinion polls have yielded conflicting indications about whether a majority favor a change			0
@entity128 , the national sales manager at flag manufacturer @entity129 , said ' older people tend to want the status quo , ' while younger people feel differently			0
earlier this year mr @entity12 said he would personally like to see a new flag using a symbol drawn from @entity3 's native flora			1
he said : ' my own personal view is that the silver fern is the right way to go			2
in my view , the silver fern is something which is applied to our greatest sporting teams .			2

silver fern symbol is used by @entity3 's @entity11 rugby team
current flag includes @entity23 's @entity22 flag in the top left corner
many @entity3 see it as an *outdated* symbol of @entity23 colonial rule
others say changing it would be an insult to men who have died under it
