former president @entity1 was given a series of direct warnings throughout 2001 about the possibility of a terrorist attack by @entity6 - but failed to take them seriously , it was claimed today			1
on the eleventh anniversary of the atrocity , it has been reported that the @entity11 received multiple briefs between may and august that year about an attack with explosives and numerous casualties			1
but the president continually failed to take any significant action and questioned the thoroughness of the briefings - leading to huge frustrations within the @entity20			1
the retrospective report was lambasted as ' unfair ' and a ' disservice to history ' by @entity24 , the @entity25 state governor during 9/11 who praised @entity1 's leadership in the months after the attacks			1
people are pictured walking away from the @entity42 following the attacks but it shows the repeated warnings came before the famous top secret briefing - which has previously been reported - given to @entity1 on august 6 with the heading ' @entity47 to strike in the @entity32 '			1
just a few weeks later on september 11 , terrorists smashed planes into the @entity42 in @entity50 - killing nearly 3,000 people and horrifying the world			0
details of the other briefings given to mr @entity1 and his administration - which have never been made public - have now been revealed by @entity56			2
and they paint a startling picture of negligence at the heart of the @entity32 government before 9/11			1
the @entity11 was made aware of potential attacks in the spring and , by may 1 , was told by the @entity20 that ' a group presently in the @entity32 ' was planning a terrorist attack , the @entity56 reported			1
concerns : revelations about the briefings paint a worrying picture of negligence at the heart of the @entity32 government leading up to 9/11 which left almost 3,000 people dead horrific : this famous photo taken on september 11 , 2001 shows president @entity1 's chief of staff @entity72 whispering into his ear to tell him of a plane crashing into the @entity42 may 1 , 2001 @entity20 told @entity11 that ' a group presently in the @entity32 ' was planning a terrorist operation ' with explosives ' june 22 , 2001 @entity20 brief reported that @entity6 attacks could be ' imminent ' june 29 , 2001 warning that the government needed to take briefs seriously			1
added evidence included @entity47 aides warning of an attack and operatives claiming it would have ' dramatic consequences ' july 1 , 2001 @entity88 said the operation had been delayed but ' will occur soon ' july 9 , 2001 extremist in @entity91 linked to @entity6 told followers there would soon be big news - and within 48 hours the information was passed to the @entity11 july 24 , 2001 @entity1 told the attack was still under preparation but that it had been postponed august 6 , 2001 @entity1 received review of threats posed by @entity6 with headline : ' @entity47 to strike in @entity32 ' in another daily brief on june 22 , the administration was told that @entity6 strikes could be ' imminent '			1
however , the new neoconservative leaders at the @entity105 told the @entity11 that the @entity20 had been fooled			2
they believed that @entity47 was pretending to plan an attack to distract the @entity32 from @entity108 leader @entity107			1
following this , the @entity20 prepared another daily brief for june 29 in which they listed over a page the evidence which they had built up			0
this included an interview with a journalist from the @entity116 in which aides of @entity47 warned of an upcoming attack			1
the briefing also included : ' the @entity32 is not the target of a disinformation campaign by @entity123			0
' it also included details from people close to @entity47 which claimed the expected attacks would have dramatic consequences with many casualties			2
another warning on july 1 said despite the attack being delayed it would soon take place			0
but despite these warnings the @entity11 did not appear to take them as seriously as the @entity20 was demanding			2
the @entity56 reports that officials within the @entity20 's @entity137 became increasingly angry and in one meeting an official suggested the staff request a transfer so they could not be blamed when the attack occurred			2
the @entity11 was also told that the extremist @entity144 - known for his links to @entity6 - told his followers in @entity91 that there would ' be big news soon ' , the @entity56 reported			2
wrong : neoconservative leaders at the @entity105 told the @entity11 the @entity20 had been fooled			0
they believed @entity47 was pretending to plan an attack to distract the @entity32 from @entity108 leader @entity107 @entity1 was told on july 24 that the attack was still being prepared but added that it had been postponed by a few months			1
however , he did not think the briefings were adequate and requested a much more detailed analysis of @entity6			0
this was to be the famous briefing of august 6 which was eventually declassified by the @entity11 in april 2004 and made public			0
' the administration 's reaction to what mr. @entity1 was told in the weeks before that infamous briefing reflected significantly more negligence than has been disclosed , ' @entity157 wrote in the piece for the @entity56			0
' in other words , the aug. 6 document , for all of the controversy it provoked , is not nearly as shocking as the briefs that came before it			0
' following the devastating attacks on 9/11 , the @entity11 - which was receiving criticism it had ignored @entity20 warnings - said it had never been told when or where the attacks would take place			1
yet many have claimed that if the government had been on high security alert over that summer they may have found out about the planned attack - and saved the lives of thousands			0
never forget : the @entity180 is illuminated next to the @entity181 and @entity182 , left , during events marking the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on the @entity42 stunning : the tribute in @entity187 is an art installation near the site of the @entity42 in remembrance of the september 11 attacks yet @entity24 , @entity25 state governor on 9/11 , laid into @entity157 during a joint appearance on @entity193 for writing the @entity56 article about the briefings			1
' i just think this is incredibly unfortunate , to be perfectly honest			0
because first of all , having been there , on september 11th and for weeks , months thereafter president @entity1 provided inspired , effective leadership , ' @entity24 , a @entity198 , said			2
' on september 11th everything changed and to look 11 years later and say , " @entity208 , this was happening before september 11th in the summer " and go though and selectively say , " you should 've done that , you should 've done that " i think is incredibly unfair and a disservice to history			0
' and by the way if you look back there are those who could have said that president @entity214 was at fault for @entity216			0
but the government did n't look back and say , " let 's blame the president " ; we came together to fight an important war			0
