by @entity0 @entity1 turned in an inspirational display as @entity3 re-ignited their @entity5 play - off push with a comfortable 62 - 10 win over @entity7			1
full - back @entity8 , who returned to the @entity12 line - up after being dropped recently for disciplinary reasons , grabbed three tries , created another and proved a constant threat			0
the 11 - try win moves the @entity18 within a point of eighth - placed @entity20 , while @entity22 's winless streak reached 22 games			1
three and easy : @entity1 scored a hat - trick of tries as @entity3 swept aside @entity7 62 - 10 the hosts made two changes from last weekend 's defeat to @entity29 , with @entity30 returning from suspension and @entity32 from injury to replace @entity34 and @entity35			1
rovers made three changes of their own , with @entity8 , @entity38 and @entity39 coming in for former @entity22 star @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42			2
the visitors , with just two wins to their name on the road prior to the clash , really should have taken an early lead when @entity49 opened up the @entity22 defence , only for @entity51 to refuse what would have been a try - scoring pass to @entity54			0
but the @entity18 were on the board on nine minutes , @entity57 's clever offload allowing @entity58 to ease over at the posts			0
the @entity7 were mightily close to hauling themselves level with their first real assault three minutes later , only for skipper @entity62 to be held inches short			1
and that proved crucial when @entity12 moved two scores ahead on 18 minutes , @entity8 shrugging off a poor tackle from @entity65 to gallop over			0
@entity3 certainly had the edge in terms of skill and luck , grabbing a third try on 25 minutes when @entity72 's apparently aimless kick bounced away from the @entity22 defence and allowed @entity73 to touch down			1
by now the visitors were easing through the gears , @entity8 grabbing his second try eight minutes before the break when he showed a clean pair of heels to the @entity7 defence to race home from distance			1
there was still time in the half for one final @entity12 score , @entity49 booting a penalty to give the visitors a 26 - 0 interval advantage			0
it was more of the same after the break , @entity51 adding a fifth try moments after the restart when he raced the length of the field to score after intercepting a loose @entity22 pass			0
the @entity7 finally gave their long - suffering fans something to cheer on 47 minutes , @entity32 squeezing in at the corner after @entity98 looped a pass outside the @entity12 defence			1
that proved brief respite though , the @entity18 moving 36 - 4 ahead when @entity103 pounced to score after the @entity22 defence stood and watched @entity8 's grubber through			0
next to score was @entity38 , profiting with an easy finish after @entity107 had broken the @entity7 defensive line			1
an eighth try duly arrived on 63 minutes , @entity57 bursting home from close range			2
the men from the capital were able to conjure a second score , @entity32 again after good work from @entity116			0
but @entity12 were soon to pass the 50 - point barrier as firstly @entity103 added his second after a flat pass from @entity49 , with @entity51 adding a second of his own on 75 minutes after a @entity54 break			2
the final word fittingly went to @entity8 , completing his hat - trick of tries after strong play from @entity49 , who failed to add the extras but still scored 18 points with his boot .			2

@entity1 scored three tries in comfortable win for @entity3
rovers move to within a point of eighth place in @entity5
the @entity7 winless streak stretched to 22 *consecutive* games
