@entity0 has criticised coach @entity2 's tactics during @entity5 's @entity4 campaign , which ended with a 2 - 1 defeat by @entity7 in the last 16			1
@entity2 stunned the nation when he decided to leave the 32 - year - old @entity0 , @entity5 's record scorer , out of his 23 - man squad for the tournament			1
while @entity0 has been careful with his words in his television appearances during the tournament , the team 's exit prompted a pointed critique of the @entity19 coach 's approach			2
' i thought the guys did everything they could , they did everything that was asked of them , but i do n't think ( tactically ) we were set up to succeed ... and that was tough to watch			0
' @entity0 said @entity2 had turned away from the positive approach he had adopted since taking over the @entity37 team in 2011			2
agony : @entity5 's run at the @entity4 ended when they were beaten 2 - 1 by @entity7 in the last 16 ' they were set up in a way that was opposite from what they 've been the past couple of years , which is opening up , passing , attacking - trying to do that			1
and the team has been successful that way			0
' why they decided to switch that in the @entity4 , none of us will know			0
from a playing standpoint , i think the guys will probably be disappointed in the way things went , ' he said			0
after striker @entity57 was injured in their opening win against @entity60 , @entity2 opted to play @entity61 as a lone striker and @entity0 said that was a negative approach			2
backwards : @entity0 thinks it was negative to play @entity61 as a lone striker after @entity57 's injury up in the air : @entity0 is unsure whether he will return to the @entity5 national team ' my feeling as a player , if i 'm in that locker room before that game - before the @entity76 game , before the @entity7 game - and the coach walked in and said we 're playing a 4 - 5 - 1 and @entity61 is up top by himself , i would have been disappointed			1
because i would have said let 's go for it			0
i want a chance to go for it and try to win the game , ' he said			0
@entity85 forward @entity0 also criticised the decision to play @entity87 in a more advanced role in midfield			1
@entity0 evaded the question of whether he expected to return to the national team ahead of next year 's @entity92			1
that depends on a lot of conversations that would have to be held , ' he said			0
on wednesday , @entity2 said he intended to turn towards young players in the coming year as he seeks out new talent for the national team .			2

@entity0 says @entity5 were ' not set up to succeed '
