by @entity0 published : 15:16 est , 9 december 2012 updated : 18:55 est , 10 december 2012 @entity2 army officers were seen constructing the third line of the hastily erected barricades around the presidential palace of leader @entity6 today			1
the security measures followed threats of protests against president 's @entity6 's decision not to delay the referendum on his controversial draft constitution , set to be held next saturday			1
hundreds of @entity2 today marched on the presidential palace and the newly build barricades , despite @entity6 rescinded a decree that would stop the judiciary challenging his rule			1
@entity34 and secular opponents say the framework of the draft constitution is too deeply influenced by @entity6 ’s @entity38 party			1
the ratification of the constitution would seal the democratic transition that began when the country 's 2011 uprising saw dictator @entity44 ousted after three decades of one - man rule			0
@entity47 leader @entity46 called the race to a referendum an ‘ act of war ’			0
his movement called for a mass protest at the palace in @entity25			1
the building was stormed last week by activists angered by the power grab			0
protecting the palace : @entity2 president @entity6 ordered the barricades to be built after threats of further protests escalated earlier today taking it back : @entity2 president @entity6 , pictured yesterday , has announced that he will give up his ' @entity28 ' decree , which granted him near - absolute powers and immunity from courts the concrete wall is the third barrier built outside the presidential palace and as hundreds marched on the palace today @entity6 's worried proved not to be unfounded			1
however , @entity72 's choice to lift the decree last night could persuade many judges to drop their two - week strike to protest against it , which means they would oversee the referendum as is customary in @entity2			0
it was the decrees that initially sparked the wave of protests against @entity6 that has brought tens of thousands into the streets in past weeks			2
however , the rushed passage of the constitution further inflamed those who claim @entity6 and his @entity86 allies are monopolizing power in @entity2 and trying to force their agenda			1
the draft charter was adopted amid a boycott by liberal and @entity93 members of the @entity94 , meaning not all members voted			0
the document would open the door to @entity2 's most extensive implementation of @entity100 law or @entity101 , enshrining a say for @entity38 clerics in legislation , making civil rights subordinate to @entity101 and broadly allowing the state to protect ' ethics and morals '			0
it fails to outlaw gender discrimination and mainly refers to women in relation to home and family			0
protect and serve : @entity2 army engineers and soldiers work on the barricades outside the @entity2 presidential palace in his late night announcement on saturday , @entity6 replaced the scrapped decrees with a new one that does n't give him unrestricted powers , but allows him to give voters an option if they decide to vote " no " on the disputed draft charter			1
in the new decree , if the constitution is rejected , @entity6 would call for new elections to select 100 - member panel to write a new charter within three months			2
the new panel would then have up to six months to complete its task , and the president calls for a new referendum with a month			2
@entity137 , a writer and activist , called the partial concession a ' stunt ' that would embarrass the opposition by making it look like @entity6 was willing to compromise but not solve the problem			0
' in the end , @entity6 got everything he wanted , ' he said , pointing out the referendum would be held without the consensus @entity6 had promised to seek and without giving people sufficient time to study the document			2
yesterday @entity6 was warned by the powerful @entity2 army that ‘ anything other than dialogue will force us into a dark tunnel with disastrous consequences			0
’ the statement , broadcast on @entity2 state tv was attributed to an anonymous official who promised the military would not allow this to happen			0
planning president : behind the barricades , inside his palace , president @entity6 prepares his next move after @entity2 army leaders gave an ultimatum to him and the opposition to hold talks good idea : the building works may have been justified as it was reported that several hundreds of @entity2 marched on the palace to protest against the vote on the draft constitution next saturday			1

president build third concrete wall to protect the palace from protestors
hundreds marched on the palace in @entity25 today despite @entity6 rescinding his ' *pharaoh* ' power which made his decisions immune from courts
