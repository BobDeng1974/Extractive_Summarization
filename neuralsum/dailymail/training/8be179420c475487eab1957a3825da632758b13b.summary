this is the moment @entity1 lost a bit of its bite			0
a great white shark snapped off one of its fearsometeeth as it launched a surprise attack on a seal in the waters off @entity12			1
the moment was captured by photographer @entity14 , 41 , who noticed the gnasher flying through the air when he checked the images later			1
mr @entity14 had been sailing for weeks in search of the perfect wildlife shot			2
snap : the errant tooth ( circled ) can be seen flying out of the shark 's mouth as its clamps its jaws around the seal it was hunting in @entity27 he said : ' it all happened incredibly quickly , i did n’t know the shark had lost its tooth until i zoomed in on the image on the back of my camera to check if the photo was sharp and in focus			2
' i have never seen this happen or even seen a photo of this happening on a real seal hunt before , its definitely a unique shot			0
@entity44 : @entity14 , 41 , took the incredible picture off the coast of @entity12 , @entity27 ' it was a cloudy day which made it great hunting conditions for the shark , the cloud it makes it much more difficult for the seal to spot the shark and its grey back makes for perfect camouflage			1
' i do n’t think it can be too painful for the shark to lose one tooth as they can lose up to 50,000 in a lifetime , also their teeth are attached to skin rather than being embedded in their jaw			0
' the final pictures were definitely worth the wait and i would do it all again in a heartbeat			0

great white was pictured in the waters off of @entity12 , @entity27
photographer @entity14 , 41 , captured the moment
but he only noticed the flying tooth when he checked again later
