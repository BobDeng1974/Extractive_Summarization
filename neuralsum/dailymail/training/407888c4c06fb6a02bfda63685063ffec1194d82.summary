by @entity0 published : 13:38 est , 10 april 2013 updated : 17:09 est , 10 april 2013 a notorious @entity2 impostor has been found guilty of first - degree murder in the death of a man whose bones were found buried beneath a @entity8 home in 1985			1
@entity2 was tried 28 years after the disappearance of newlyweds @entity11 and @entity12 in a heavily circumstantial cold case			1
much of the prosecution ’s evidence focused on the strange behavior of the man who adopted many names including @entity2			1
he masqueraded as an heir to the fabled oil fortune for 20 years			2
the verdict was reached on wednesday after the jury deliberated about a day			1
he was known then as @entity37 and intimated he was of royal lineage			2
he joined the church , befriended residents and told some he was a film student			2
a friend said @entity12 once described the tenant in the cottage owned by @entity11 ’s mother as ' creepy ' and said she and her husband never spoke to him			0
the town folk did n’t connect him with the disappearance of the @entity48 couple in 1985 , but shortly after they vanished , so did he			0
no trace of @entity12 has been found but @entity11 ’s bones were unearthed during excavation of a swimming pool at the @entity36 property in 1994			2
with no clues , the mystery went cold again			0
@entity2 sits with one of his attorneys as a verdict was reached at the @entity60 in @entity29 today @entity2 , who went by the @entity61 , was found guilty of killing his landlord , @entity62 , in february 1985 the @entity25 native who consorted for years with @entity65 social elite by pretending to be a @entity2 was convicted wednesday in @entity29 of first - degree murder but across the country , a man variously known as @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity2 was inventing new lives for himself			1
this impostor wormed his way into high society and talked his way into important jobs			0
he married a wealthy woman and controlled her funds , but his identity unraveled when he kidnapped their daughter during a custody dispute			0
she testified that he became increasingly paranoid when police begin inquiring about him			0
when he was unmasked , he became the subject of magazine articles , true crime books and tv movies that sought to explore his bizarre story and get to the heart of the man behind the pseudonyms			0
the resulting publicity led @entity8 authorities to revisit the @entity95 disappearance			0
they realized the man in custody in @entity99 was not an heir to the @entity2 fortune but was the man who had lived in @entity36 decades ago			1
@entity2 , 52 , was accused of bludgeoning his landlady 's adult son with a blunt object and then digging a 3 - foot - deep grave in the backyard of the victimís home @entity109 , sister of @entity62 whose remains were unearthed in @entity36 , @entity8 in 1985 , speaks to the press after @entity2 of @entity25 was found guilty of first degree murder in @entity29 a photo of swimming pool area being unearthed 1994 and finding the remains of @entity62 in the backyard of a home on @entity118 in @entity36 , @entity8 already serving time for the kidnapping of his young daughter in a @entity99 custody dispute , @entity2 was close to the end of his sentence and headed for freedom when the murder charge changed that			1
after a quarter century , authorities believed they had linked him to the disappearance of his old neighbor , @entity12			0
defense attorneys suggested that @entity12 , not their client , killed her husband			0
but no motive was offered for her or @entity2 to have killed the young man			1
prosecutors filled in the blanks of the defendant ’s whereabouts during the decades of his disappearance			2
but some details were unlikely ever to be explained			0
he chose not to testify in his own defense and much of the trial testimony came from people now hobbled by age who knew him in @entity36 as @entity37 , a stranger with a murky past			0
yesterday , prosecutor @entity145 told the jury that @entity2 murdered @entity62 in @entity36 28 years ago and said that all the evidence they needed to convict him was there			1
' this is n't a movie , a book , a tv show , a docudrama , ' the deputy district attorney said in his closing argument , referring to the fact that the case has been turned into all of those things over the years			2
' this case is about two people who lived and died , ' @entity145 said			0
@entity2 is on trial in @entity8 , @entity162 for the 1985 murder of @entity62 , who disappeared from his home in @entity36 with his wife , @entity12 defendant @entity2 was charged only with the murder of mr @entity62 in suburban @entity36 , but the prosecutor was allowed to say he believes @entity2 also killed mr @entity62 ' wife , who remains missing after nearly three decades			1
' she 's dead ' , @entity145 said repeatedly as he described the disappearance of @entity12 and her husband , john - newlyweds he said had no reason to vanish			1
the bones of @entity62 were unearthed in the backyard of his mother 's former house in @entity36 a decade after he and his wife disappeared			1
he was found to have died from multiple fractures to the skull , probably caused by a blunt instrument such as a baseball bat			2
@entity2 lived as a tenant on the property in 1984 and 1985 , but called himself @entity37 then			1
he vanished around the same time the couple disappeared in 1985 , according to witnesses			0
as part of his closing argument , @entity145 used a powerpoint presentation that showed pieces of a jigsaw puzzle falling into place			0
@entity145 predicted that the defense would seek to paint @entity12 as the murderer of her husband			0
previously the trial heard from @entity2 's ex-wife @entity198 , right , to whom he lied about who he was ' they 're going to batter her over and over and say she was the mastermind , ' @entity145 said in his presentation			1
' but all the evidence in this case is going to point you to the fact that only one person was the mastermind			2
... he is charged with murder			0
' however , defense attorney @entity210 was less demeaning of @entity12 than he was of his own client			0
he said @entity2 , a @entity25 immigrant , was a white - collar criminal with a long list of offenses including identity theft and immigration fraud			1
' over a period of time in this country , he committed a lot of crimes with which he was never charged ' , @entity210 said			0
' it 's no wonder he would want to stay under the radar			2
' but the lawyer said his client had not been running from a murder investigation			0
the defendant , seen here with pen in his hand , took copious notes as the prosecutor summed up the case against him @entity210 noted that no trace evidence was scientifically connected to the defendant , and he suggested it was more likely that @entity12 had a ' dark side ' of her life that led her to kill her husband			1
but he offered no evidence to support that contention			2
' that 's the stuff that reasonable doubt is made of ' , he told jurors			2
' you do n't know what happened			0
if you do n't know what happened , you ca n't convict anybody			2
' @entity145 noted that monday was the 28th anniversary of the day @entity12 and @entity62 were reported missing			1
' what do we do with a case 28 years old ? ' he said , acknowledging there are no eye witnesses or physical evidence in the case			1
' circumstantial evidence is just as powerful ' , @entity145 said as he detailed the pieces of his puzzle			1
' not only does he flee , he changes his identity and discontinues contacts with friends			0
why ? because he 's a murderer ' , the prosecutor said			1
eventually , @entity2 turned up on the @entity264 using the name @entity2 and living well at the expense of his wealthy wife			1
@entity2 was previously prosecuted for kidnapping his own daughter and is serving a prison sentence for that crime			1
defense lawyers have suggested that he lived a life of pretense , making up wild stories about royal lineage , but they say he never killed anyone			0
' he lied at will and his life was based on that ' , @entity210 said			0
' he said he was a filmmaker and he could amend the script anytime he wanted			0
' @entity2 was previously accused of kidnapping his own daughter @entity279 , above , in 2009 @entity145 reminded jurors of testimony by former friends from @entity36			1
a woman remembered seeing dirt in his yard where a large hole had been dug			0
a forensic expert said traces of blood were found on the concrete floor beneath a rug in the guest cottage the defendant occupied , bt it was never clear if the blood was human or animal , and it was not linked to @entity2			1
the prosecutor also emphasized what was found in the backyard grave along with bones - plastic shopping bags from the @entity303 and @entity304 at @entity305 , two colleges the defendant attended			1
' the case is easy ' , said @entity145			0
' the evidence is right in front of your eyes			2
' the only thing missing , he acknowledged was a motive			0
why would the defendant kill @entity62 ? ' the prosecution need not prove why ' , he said			1
' it 's not part of our burden of proof			2
nor do we need to prove the type of weapon used or where he was killed			0
' superior court judge @entity327 instructed jurors that if they can not agree on the charge of first - degree murder , they have the option of considering second - degree murder , which does not require premeditation			1
he told jurors to return tuesday for @entity335 's rebuttal before the start of their deliberations			2
accused : @entity2 is accused of the 1985 murder of @entity62 man of mystery : @entity2 did not tell the women in his lift that he was actually a @entity25 immigrant connection : the bones believed to belong to mr @entity62 were found buried at a home @entity346 was living at while going by the name @entity347 violent death : the remains believed to be of @entity62 , seen with his then - wife @entity12 , who is also missing , were found to have died of multiple fractures of the skull inflicted by a blunt object , possibly a baseball bat			1
