his father , 49 , said : ' there 's always that danger when you have got somebody like @entity2 , who is known at the time , that their name could be forgotten by future generations			1
' it 's a strange thing to think about having a street named after our son			2
' it 's not for us to decide , it 's for the local council and local people , but we would be very proud to have a street named after @entity2			1
it would be the same for anybody in the same position			0
' @entity62 and @entity63 has already implemented the idea , creating @entity65 and @entity66 in tribute to soldiers who died in @entity3			1
precedent : @entity65 was 27 when he was killed in @entity70 in august 2007 and this street in @entity62 was named after him after a campaign by his mother @entity73 ( pictured with his former colleagues ) campaign : the case of private @entity65 ( left ) is an example of what @entity79 's @entity78 ( right ) would like to see happen to street names across the @entity11 @entity35 and @entity82 mp @entity82 said naming a street after @entity38 would be a fitting tribute			1
he said : ' most of us would rather live in a world where our service personnel were occupied in carrying out peace - time duties			0

' no one who recently attended the @entity35 funeral of @entity99 would have any doubts about the willingness of @entity102 to name a street after this brave soldier whose life , full of promise , was cut short by a bullet in @entity3			2
' shadow defence secretary @entity78 has called for councils to embrace naming streets after war heroes , saying they could provide a ' lasting personal memorial ' to those who give their lives for @entity11			2
