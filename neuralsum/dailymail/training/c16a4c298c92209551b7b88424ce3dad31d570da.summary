by @entity0 the former youth police and crime commissioner @entity1 has been interviewed under caution @entity1 , the foul - mouthed youth crime commissioner who was forced to quit after her string of offensive tweets , has been interviewed under caution about her comments			1
the 17 - year - old 's mobile phone was seized and she was questioned by officers from @entity13 police 's @entity11			2
her lawyers described @entity16 ’s response as ' wholly disproportionate ' and claimed it was ' inconceivable ' that her comments would be sufficient grounds for prosecution			1
@entity21 accused @entity16 overreacting and accused them of having no proper basis for interviewing the teenager under caution , or making her surrender her phone , the @entity20 reported			1
police started investigating 17 - year - old former youth police and crime commissioner @entity1 after discovering she used a racial slur in her @entity29 profile			1
miss @entity1 resigned after it was revealed that she used her personal @entity29 account to make a series of offensive , racist and homophobic posts			1
@entity16 are understood to be looking at tweets where miss @entity1 uses the word ' n * * * * * ' – an offensive term for black people – in alternative spellings			1
the force also confirmed it has received more than 50 complaints but is yet to decide whether miss @entity1 has committed any offence			1
miss @entity1 wrote the messages during the last six months before she was given the role of helping the force ' stay in touch with young people '			2
she called homosexuals ' fags ' , immigrants ' illegals ' and travellers ' pikeys ' , and said she had ' a thing for older men ' , an apparent reference to a teacher at her former school			0
in another tweet , seemingly referring to cannabis , she wrote : ' i really wan na make a batch of hash brownies			0
' and she attacked the men in the reality tv programme made in @entity77 , writing : ' everyone on made in @entity77 looks like a * * * * * * * fag			0
' @entity1 's lawyers have written to @entity13 police chief constable @entity81 about the scope and nature of the investigation today it emerged that @entity87 's lawyers , @entity88 , have written to @entity13 police chief constable @entity81 about the scope and nature of the investigation , including the decision to seize her phone and for @entity11 to quiz her			1
in the letter , her lawyers said : ' that appears to be wholly disproportionate and unjustified having regard to the @entity29 material itself and the broader circumstances of the case			1
' they said @entity87 , from @entity101 , @entity13 , was visited by a @entity11 officer at her home on april 11 , along with a second officer , and asked to surrender her mobile for examination			0
then she was requested to attend an interview under caution on april 14			0
she was quizzed for one hour and seven minutes about material posted on her @entity29 account which had already been published in the media			2
her phone was returned three days later			0
in their letter , her lawyers said : ' as we are sure that you will readily understand , being subject to a police investigation is highly distressing for any person , but especially so for a teenager , particularly one who has been recently subject to such adverse media coverage			0
' in such circumstances , we believe that the police must weigh carefully the extent to which an investigation relating solely to social media activity is merited			0
' @entity88 also referred to the interim guidelines from the @entity125 ( @entity126 ) , @entity127 , regarding prosecutions relating to social media			0
@entity87 's lawyers said it was ' immediately apparent ' from reviewing the @entity29 material that it would be ' inconceivable ' that they would form sufficient grounds for a prosecution			1
' there is nothing in the @entity29 material which could be deemed , even on its face , to be grossly offensive or otherwise unlawful , ' the letter added			1
' there was therefore no proper basis on which to require our 17 - year - old client to surrender her mobile telephone , to caution her or to subject her to a detailed police interview whilst under caution			0
' but @entity13 @entity16 have defended their actions , saying they are reacting to complaints from members of the public and are seeking to establish whether any offences have been committed			2
' @entity16 received more than 50 complaints from members of the public and are currently investigating to establish whether any criminal offences have been committed in relation to this incident			2
' @entity16 disagrees with the interpretation of the investigation given			2
' officers must first determine the extent of the misuse of social media so that the @entity164 can then , taking into account the @entity126 's interim guidance , determine whether or not any potential evidence meets the set criteria for a prosecution			0
' we will investigate all complaints thoroughly but can not comment further on the progress of a live investigation			0
