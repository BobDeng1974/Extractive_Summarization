@entity4 , 19 , from @entity5 , @entity6 , drew up the document of things he wishes to do before he dies after being diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer in 2009			1
it includes hunting a wild bear , getting a tattoo and watching a @entity22 fight			1
but the number one thing @entity24 wanted to do was visit topless bar , jiggles , in @entity27			2
and luckily for him , the club is one of the few in @entity31 that do not serve alcohol and therefore , allow under - 21s into the premises			1
now , the teenager has checked the wish off his list - as well as four other items , including taking a ride in a helicopter and shooting a pistol			2
after @entity24 's visit , @entity26 general manager , @entity43 , told the @entity45 : ' i am beyond flattered and i hope that he had an amazing time			2
' he added that he wished he had known about the teenager 's plans beforehand so he could have planned something special			2
' i would have definitely tried to make sure that his experience there for a bucket list was a step - up from a normal experience for a customer coming off the street			1
' @entity24 , who used to be a 140lb wrestler with ' six - pack abs ' , was diagnosed with medulloblastoma at the age of 14 after suffering from a number of agonising headaches			1
he underwent 12 - hour surgery on the tumour in his cerebullum - the brain centre for balance and coordination - followed by months of radiation and chemotherapy			2
' he had a tumour removed about the size of a golf ball , ' his father , @entity85 , told @entity89			0
' it pretty much took him down to nothing			0

it develops in the cerebellum - the part of the brain that controls muscle coordination and balance - but may spread to other parts of the brain			0
symptoms can include headaches , sickness , sight problems , slurred speech , neck stiffness and balance problems			0
the tumour is more common in boys than girls - and makes up about 20 per cent of all childhood brain tumours			0
source : @entity116 following months of gruelling treatment , @entity24 and his family were told his tumour had gone - only for it to return last month			1
this time , the teenager was told his cancer was terminal - and he may have only three months left to live			1
' we thought it was gone			0
they did scans every three months for a year to make sure it was gone , ' said mr @entity4			2
we found out in february it was back			0
' he added that his son 's tumour now stretches from his brain to the bottom of his spinal cord , where his nerves are ' matted ' with cancer			0
but despite his fate , @entity24 has taken his illness in his stride - and is quickly checking off items on his bucket list with the help of friends , family and kind - hearted strangers			1
the 17 - strong list includes laughing until he cries , getting ' @entity4 ' tattooed on his back and holding a fundraising event			1
' he put stuff on there that he knows can happen , ' said mr @entity4			2

but he 's doing pretty good and we can still do a lot of things			0
' he added : ' he is an awesome kid			0
and i 'm not just saying that because he 's mine - there is something about him , his infectious smile			0
