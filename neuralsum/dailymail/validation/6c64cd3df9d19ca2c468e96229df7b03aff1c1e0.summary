for what could be his last appearance at the @entity3 today as prime minister , @entity0 will have been coached for hours by his officials			1
but for his fateful ‘ at home ’ @entity10 interview , broadcast on monday , in which he dropped the bombshell that he did not intend to run for a third term as @entity4 , @entity0 does n’t seem to have bothered to do his homework properly at all			1
he had at least watched a recording , on the @entity15 , of @entity17 ’s own domestic disaster last week with @entity10 deputy political editor @entity18 , after which the @entity20 leader was mocked for having two kitchens			1
but @entity0 , a former political apparatchik - turned - @entity23 man , never bothered to rehearse questions that might come up			1
he may have assumed he would not walk into any bear traps – but he could not have been more wrong			0
the @entity40 prepared lunch while being interviewed the interview , when it was fixed months ago , was due to be conducted with the @entity10 ’s political editor @entity44			1
but @entity18 stepped in , as he did with @entity17 and @entity45 because @entity44 , 51 , is at home recovering from an operation to remove a tumour from his lung			2
it was clear on screen that @entity0 felt instinctively at ease with @entity53 , a fellow @entity54			1
they did n’t know each other at school as @entity0 was two years above @entity53			2
but they are both from wealthy families			0
@entity18 was brought up in rural @entity59 , while @entity0 had a similar upbringing in @entity61			2
and @entity18 went to university in @entity63 , the same city where @entity64 studied			0
the @entity10 programme , which was designed to show a softer , more homely side of @entity0 , had been going to plan , with footage of the @entity4 on the touchline at his son @entity69 ’s football match			1
then there was a trip to the butcher ’s in his @entity29 town , where he made a rather tortured joke about fellow @entity76 set member @entity77 also being a customer			2
and then he allowed the cameras into his constituency home			2
the @entity10 , who had already spent 30 minutes with @entity0 , were given an hour in the kitchen in @entity37 , where @entity0 visibly relaxed			1
perhaps if his spin machine had exerted ruthless control of events , as @entity84 once did for @entity85 , it could have been a different story			0
but so confident was @entity90 that the interview would go off without a hitch that @entity93 , the no 10 communications secretary – himself an @entity97 man – did n’t even bother to make the trip to @entity29			1
@entity0 was accompanied instead by @entity99 , the @entity90 broadcasting officer , who is a relatively junior adviser in his team			2
the agreement which was thrashed out with the @entity10 before the interview concentrated on dress code , of all things			1
both men were to be in casual weekend attire with no ties			0
there were to be limited clips of the prime minister ’s children , too , showing only the back of their heads			0
there was also an agreement to ensure there were no clips of the toys lying around the house			0
@entity34 was also , as agreed with the @entity10 , a frequent presence in the kitchen , looking suitably fragrant and glamorous			1
@entity123 , who has been with the @entity10 for 12 years after a decade at @entity125 , was not asked for a list of questions he might ask , or even subject areas in advance of the interview			1
@entity64 made a rare appearance on screen to endorse her husband as the ' right man ' for pm @entity0 has revealed he will stand down as prime minister before 2020 if he wins the next election @entity18 , whose gentle manner belies an acute political brain , knows that @entity0 has form for putting his foot it in when he ’s relaxed			2
remember his unguarded comments in @entity143 about the @entity144 ‘ purring ’ down the telephone to him over the nationalists failing to win the @entity148 referendum ? perhaps the @entity10 man sensed that the kitchen would be the most fertile place to ask tricky questions , while the pm was surrounded by his family			1
yet the question over whether @entity0 intended to serve a third term was hardly a bombshell : @entity0 could have easily dismissed it			1
the fact that he answered it calmly and directly triggered suspicion in some quarters that it was agreed in advance			0
but @entity18 says he was taken aback by the response , so much so that he hoped the surprise did n’t show on his face			0
the meltdown that followed in @entity90 as the gravity of the political story became evident supports @entity53 ’s version of events			0
in his @entity10 blog , @entity18 denies it was a set - up			2
‘ it was not something that a helpful @entity90 official had suggested i might ask – with a heavy hint i might get an interesting answer			2
it was just one of many speculative questions that political journalists like me ask in the hope that occasionally they might get an answer			0
and this time i did			0
earlier this week , @entity0 announced he would not bid for a third term if he is successful in may 's general election			1
he has since insisted he is taking ' nothing for granted ' and his focus is on beating ' @entity17 ' ‘ but by answering my question , he has potentially opened a @entity189			1
he has invited @entity190 and the country to contemplate a time when he is no longer prime minister , a dangerous gamble to make so close to an election			0
’ @entity0 ’s supporters know that for some time he has been trying to squash speculation that if the @entity197 win , he will stand down as @entity4 after the planned 2017 @entity199 referendum			1
now , his reply to @entity53 is naturally being portrayed by his political opponents as an arrogant assumption he will win the election			0
as the political fallout continues , @entity90 surely has only itself to blame			0
the film was completed at lunchtime on saturday , giving @entity90 48 hours to decide how to handle the story and try to control it to best advantage			0
officials could have leaked it in advance to try to ensure a positive spin on the revelation			0
or does the absence of any damage limitation strategy suggest that the @entity4 got out exactly the message he wanted – even if he had n’t worked out its explosive implications ?			0

@entity0 said earlier this week that he would not bid for a third term
it came during an interview for @entity10 in the kitchen of his @entity29 home
@entity0 said two terms were ' *wonderful* ' but three ' might just be too many '
named @entity229 , @entity230 and @entity231 as successors
has now insisted he was just giving ‘ straight answer to a straight question ’
