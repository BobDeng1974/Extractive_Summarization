he does n't believe there was any			0
' all i can say about that is there is conflict in that			0
' we do n't know how bright the indicators would have been at the time of the collision , if indeed there was indication from mr @entity79			2
' one thing that is clear is that this accident happened very suddenly and very quickly			0

' clearly speed was a significant factor			0
