by @entity0 published : 18:28 est , 14 january 2014 updated : 18:58 est , 14 january 2014 the mastermind of the september 11 terrorist attacks has penned a 36 - page manifesto in an effort to convert his lawyers and the judge in the ‘ kangaroo court ’ to @entity9			1
@entity10 uses quotes from former presidents @entity12 and @entity14 as argument points in his push against @entity17 , ‘ the so - called " @entity19 " ’ and @entity18			1
the manifesto , obtained by @entity21 , was the first of three planned parts that the @entity25 leader has written from inside the most secure portion of @entity27 where he and other high - value detainees are held			1
his new mission : @entity10 ( right ) wrote the first of a three - part manifesto wherein he describes his desire to convert all of the @entity34 in the trial process - including his lawyer and judge - to @entity9 @entity10 ’s statement marks a dramatic change from his earlier statements , as he previously defended the right to use violence in order to spread the word of @entity9			1
instead , the document attempts to make a more rationalized and philosophical argument			0
‘ it is my religious duty in dealing with any @entity34 such as the people in court ( the judge , the prosecution , attorneys , etc. ) to invite them to embrace @entity9 … it is my own belief that @entity56 will ask me on the @entity57 why i did not invite these people to @entity9 ? ’ he writes			2
‘ @entity17 crusader soldier men and women join the @entity17 army , wear the latest military gear , eat the best food in @entity64 and @entity65 , and play with their play stations ... but at the end , the @entity17 soldiers ’ - writes @entity10 ‘ do not believe those who claim that the @entity71 fight infidels to turn them to @entity9 or that we are fighting you because you practice democracy , freedom , or claim that you uphold human rights			1
@entity9 prohibits us to force our religion on any human being but encourages us to invite them with wisdom and fair preaching and to persuade them in the best way			2
’ the document is written in @entity84 as the terrorist attended college in @entity87 and has a strong understanding of the language			0
he regularly refers to the collective group of those fighting - many times violently - for @entity9 as the @entity92			2
‘ i wanted to write these papers in three parts			0
i had written most of the first part before they took away our laptops that contain the evidence , at the end of 2009			0
i will later work on to complete the remaining two parts after the government returns our computers soon , ’ he wrote			0
he teases that the two yet - unwritten chapters will include his justifications for the september 11th terrorist attacks , as well as his views on the ensuing war on terror			1
@entity110 : @entity10 was captured in 2003 and he has declared himself to be the mastermind behind the september 11 terrorist attacks that left nearly 3,000 dead - but now he has renounced violence as a means of conversion ‘ the second part deals with why the @entity71 carried out 9/11 and whether it was a terrorist operation or an act of self - defense sanctioned by every constitution and international laws as the right of everyone whose land is occupied and whose people are attacked , ’ he wrote			1
the third portion poses a number of questions about the wars that followed which will surely become fodder for conspiracy theorists , as he asks ‘ were they fought to defend freedom and human rights ? women 's rights ? or were they fought for the benefits and interests of individuals and corporations ? ’ while the first few pages focus largely on the sunny interpretation of himself as a messenger of @entity56 , the manifest spins into a diatribe against @entity149 social ills , slamming the @entity150 , same sex relationships , and greed			1
one of the most pointed critiques comes when he uses the high rate of suicide among returning @entity17 veterans as a mark against the wars in @entity64 and @entity65 as well as @entity17 might			0
‘ @entity17 crusader soldier men and women join the @entity17 army , wear the latest military gear , eat the best food in @entity64 and @entity65 , and play with their play stations while their enemies , the poor @entity167 ca n’t find their daily bread or jacket to protect themselves from the harsh snowstorms over @entity65 mountains , but at the end , the @entity17 soldiers go home and commit suicide but the poor man still with his dry bread and black tea lives with his poor wife in their humble muddy house but with happy hearts and souls , ’ he wrote			0
the legal fight against @entity10 , who is commonly referred to as @entity10 , formally began in february 2008 when he was charged with organizing the september 11 attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people			1
the trial has been plagued by controversies , starting with whether it would be held in a military or civilian court and more recently with the decision to allow @entity10 and his other defendants from wearing soldier ’s fatigues in the courtroom			2
on his current state of happiness : with my current condition , i live in solitary confinement , but i am very happy in my cell because my spirit is free even while my body is being held captive happiness is not found only in money , in hearing music , in dancing , or in living a so - called " free life			2
" eve if you were a rich man or woman , you would need to follow the real path of happiness as it has been established in the humans ' catalog and manual , " @entity216 "			0
on his call to convert non-muslims : it is my religious duty in dealing with any non-muslims such as the people in the court ( the judge , the prosecution , attorneys , etc. ) to invite them to embrace @entity9			1
i realize very well that you have heard about @entity9 and know much about it			2
but it is my own belief that @entity56 will ask me on the @entity57 why i did not invite these people to @entity9 ? on same sex relationships and sexual activities : if @entity234 said no adultery or no sexual contact without a marriage contract between man and woman , the @entity235 's @entity234 says men and women are free to do whatever they want to do			1
a mother can even lie with her son and they can issue a marriage certificate for them if the majority in @entity249 or @entity250 agrees to such a thing			0
or a man can marry a man or a woman can marry a woman , but by @entity234 's laws , these acts are considered social crimes and it will cause unhappiness in their life , it breaks their families and at the end it will break the whole society			0
on @entity149 moral bankruptcy : their communities have been destroyed by the high rates of divorce , rape , robbery , killing , suicide , @entity276 , and often depression , bankruptcies , abortion , drugs , homosexuals , homelessness , psychological disorders , mental illnesses and most of the @entity17 prisons are over capacity and crime is everywhere among all races and states ' on @entity17 military suicide rates : ( @entity293 ) undreds of @entity17 crusader soldier men and women join the @entity17 army , wear the latest military gear , eat the best food in @entity64 and @entity65 , and play with their play stations while their enemies , the poor @entity167 ca n’t find their daily bread or jacket to protect themselves from the harsh snowstorms over @entity65 mountains , but at the end , the @entity17 soldiers go home and commit suicide but the poor man still with his dry bread and black tea lives with his poor wife in their humble muddy house but with happy hearts and souls			1
on his process of writing the manifesto : i wanted to write these papers in three parts			0
i had written most of the first part before they took away our laptops that contain the evidence , at the end of 2009			0
i will later work on to complete the remaining to parts after the government returns our computers soon as it has promised : the first part is an invitation to happiness , to everyone the crusader government has provided to administer this kangaroo trial in @entity27 : the judge , the prosecution , the lawyers and anyone who works with those groups			2
the second part deals with why the @entity71 carried out 9/11 and whether it was a terrorist operation or an act of self - defense sanctioned by every constitution and international laws as the right of everyone whose land is occupied and whose people are attacked			0
the third part is the truth about the so - called " @entity19 "			1
for whose benefits or interests were these wars fought ? did these wars take place to defend the @entity17 people and their interests ? were they fought to defend freedom and human rights ? women 's rights ? or were they fought for the benefits and interests of individuals and corporations ? who are those individuals and corporations ? what are their interests and benefits ? is n't it true that they work for the weapons industry lobbies , security contractors or @entity378 sister companies etc. ?			0

@entity10 was the self - *proclaimed* mastermind who planned the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks

criticizes adultery , same sex relationships , depression , soldier suicides and @entity276 all as *examples* of *problems* with @entity149 morality
