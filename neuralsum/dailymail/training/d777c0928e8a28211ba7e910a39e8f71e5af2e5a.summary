' my first marriage - i got divorced in the 90s - i spent loads of time with my kids , the boys , as they were growing up			1
' i worked in the @entity58 so 5 , 6 o'clock on friday it was over , did n't start again until monday morning			0
' so i had time for the kids as they were growing up , the boys			0
and i guess my daughters have seen less of me than they probably should have done			0
' mr @entity0 , the @entity1 leader , also admitted that he would never be prime minister – and did not want to be either @entity0 insisted he had no regrets about going into politics - but claimed it had left him ' poor '			1
the @entity1 leader said he earned ' about half of what the local headmaster or gp earns '			1
but mr @entity0 and his wife @entity72 enjoy a lifestyle far beyond the reach of ordinary voters			2
the couple live in a home worth around £ 540,000 and have annual earnings of more than £ 100,000 , including : when asked if he would ever be prime minister , he told them : ' i doubt it '			2
the @entity11 pair pressed him if he wanted to be the pm			1
he replied : ' not really			0
there are two types of people in politics : those who want to be something and those who want to do something			0
i want to do something			0
changing things in the country and changing the debate really interests me			0
' the programme , @entity96 with @entity12 and @entity9 , is based in @entity0 and mrs @entity19 's bed and breakfast in @entity99			1
the posh @entity100 sits in the constituency of @entity102 where mr @entity0 will be standing in his bid to become an mp in the 2015 general election			1
over the course of the interview , mr @entity0 joins the couple in their local pub before ending up wearing his host 's trousers after spilling champagne down his after a ' rip roaring ' evening			1
on @entity114 mr @entity0 insisted that he did not collapse because of booze			1
he said : ' they wanted to get me to pose sitting on a concrete step with them having a glass of champagne which i did			0
' my body is n't particularly great at getting down and getting up again with all the back and neck problems i 've got			0
so i got up and missed the top step with my ... with a sort of toe			0
' and the glass of champagne came out of my hand			0
and my very light grey trousers were covered in champagne			0
' so you know i 've no doubt that one or two newspapers before this is broadcast next will say that i collapsed			0
but nothing could be further from the truth			0
' he added : ' we had a couple of pints and a few glasses of wine			2
it was n't even ... it was n't silly i promise you			0
' @entity9 and @entity146 @entity0 is on @entity15 , monday december 15 , at 10pm @entity0 's @entity148 - born wife @entity72 keeps a very low profile and is rarely seen in public in his early 20s @entity0 had the first of several brushes with death , when he was run over by a car in @entity155 , @entity99 , after a night in the pub. he sustained severe injuries and doctors feared he would lose a leg			1

after splitting with ms @entity161 he married @entity165 - born bond trader @entity164 in 1999			2
months after recovering from his road accident , mr @entity0 was diagnosed with testicular cancer			2
it is one of the great contradictions of the @entity1 leader that while he rails against @entity172 ‘ coming over here ’ and taking the jobs , homes and public services of @entity176 that he is married to a @entity165 who could move here under the rules which he wants to tear up			1
he jokes that being married to a foreigner is proof that he loves @entity172			0
@entity148 - born @entity72 keeps a very low profile and is rarely seen in public			2
at @entity1 conferences , she sits anonymously in the audience			2
she and mr @entity0 met in @entity185 in 1996 , while he was travelling on business - and still married to his first wife			1
of the moment he met @entity72 , he once said : ‘ she was a stunning government bond broker whose brisk efficiency at first sight belied her ethereal appearance			0
' she could have stepped into a @entity194 painting no questions asked			0
’ later , he explained in typically flamboyant style : ‘ my marriage , which had been on ice and torpid with its claws bound for so long we had both forgotten it was alive at all , finally expired			0
’ the couple divorced in 1997 and mr @entity0 married @entity72 in 1999			1
@entity72 , gave up her career in the @entity58 , where she worked as an interpreter for a @entity165 bank , to look after the children - she and mr @entity0 have two - and take her husband ’s correspondence			1
she writes all his emails because he dislikes using computers and is paid a salary by the @entity213 of more than £ 27,000 and has amassed more than £ 200,000 since she began working for him .			0
