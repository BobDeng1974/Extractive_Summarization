by @entity0 @entity1 is an obsessive			1
what he likes doing more than anything else is collecting things — things that you or i might not necessarily think are worth collecting			0
one of his most treasured collections consists of @entity11 merchandise			1
so impressed was the teenage @entity1 with @entity11 ’s spoon - bending prowess that he hunted down every product that @entity11 has ever endorsed — from a limited - edition range of porcelain plates , to a collection of psychically energised teddy bears			1
@entity18 : @entity1 made it his mission to find the boy in the book when he sees that 506 different @entity25 books are being auctioned on @entity26 , @entity23 does not hesitate			1
as far as he ’s concerned , @entity25 , a series of books produced in the @entity29 in which the reader has the power to determine the plot , are every bit as collectible as @entity11 teddies			1
he puts in what turns out to be a winning bid of £ 41.01 , and a few days later a large parcel arrives at his home			0
at this point something strange happens			0
inside one of the books , @entity41 finds several sheets of paper			0
they are a diary , or a section of diary , written 20 years earlier by the original owner , a 15 - year - old boy called @entity51			1
what strikes @entity23 most of all is how sad the entries are			0
the boy who had written them plainly had no friends and no self - confidence			1
bullied at school , he had sought refuge in the fantasy of becoming a hero			0
the most disturbing entry reads simply : ‘ left school with intention to kill myself			0
’ @entity1 becomes determined to track down @entity51 and find out what had happened to him			1
his girlfriend warns him that this is not necessarily a good idea — after all , @entity51 may no longer be alive — but he ’s having none of it			0
he has found a new obsession			2
mind - reading teddy ? one of @entity1 's obsessions was collecting @entity11 's psychically energised teddy bears ( stock photo ) his early efforts are not promising			1
although @entity1 finds plenty of @entity80 , none of them is the author of the diary — although one does turn out to be the archbishop of @entity85			1
but the more he digs , the more he comes to realise that he is also exploring his own past			0
he , too , was a lonely , self - conscious adolescent and his quest becomes in part a quest for the boy that he used to be			1
by dint of some dogged detective work , @entity41 finally runs @entity51 to ground , alive and well and living with his parents in a suburb of @entity96			0
‘ the door is pulled open by a boyish - looking man , wearing a tee - shirt and jeans			2
this is the boy in the book			1
’ while the two men chat away and end up forging a kind of friendship , @entity51 himself proves to be a bit of a letdown			2
far from being mired in gloom , he seems disappointingly well - adjusted			2
while he was clearly an unhappy adolescent , his suicidal urges were never that strong , he insists — although he did once put a loaded air pistol in his mouth and pull the trigger			0
‘ the pellet must have hit my tongue or something , because it bounced straight out and landed in the bath			0
’ and that , you might think , would be the end of it			2
after all , @entity41 has found @entity51 — where else is there for him to go ? quite a lot of places , it turns out			2
he goes to see an expert on diaries , a child psychologist and even a graphologist to get @entity51 ’s handwriting analysed			1
real - live theatre : @entity1 's experiences provide material for his comedy routines by now a little worm of suspicion had begun to flex itself in my mind — the suspicion that what was driving @entity41 was n’t just an obsession , but something else			1
he is , after all , a stand - up comic who has performed with @entity146 among others , and he clearly thinks there ’s some professional mileage to be got out of his quest			1
indeed , as he reveals at the end , he ’s turned the whole thing into a ‘ live , interactive , real - life theatre show called @entity154 ’			1
nothing wrong with that , of course , except it does make you feel that @entity41 might be a bit more hard - nosed , maybe even a bit more ruthless , than he likes to make out			2
you get a sense of this in the chapter where he goes back to his childhood home in @entity167 , @entity168 and looks up a girl called @entity170 who he had a crush on when he was a teenager			0
they go to a park where @entity41 has arranged for a guitarist friend of his to play @entity175			0
and then he shoots off back to his girlfriend in @entity177 , presumably leaving a shell - shocked @entity170 to resume her life as a lonely divorcee			2
one of the problems with being an obsessive collector is that you ca n’t stop accumulating stuff			0
it ’s the same with this book			0
somewhere in here is a fascinating and touching story , but it ’s been all but buried beneath a mountain of clutter .			0

@entity18 stand - up comic @entity1 's collections *include* @entity11 psychically energised teddy bears
when he found a book containing pages from a 15 - year - old boy 's diary , he did **n't** rest until he had tracked him down
his quest did **n't** end there - after meeting the diarist he spoke to child psychologists and had the handwriting analysed
