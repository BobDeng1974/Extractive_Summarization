@entity1 's famous curves may adorn glossy magazine covers today but that would not have always been the case			1
rewind 100 years and the perfect female figure was an altogether different story			0
inspired by @entity8 , @entity7 has taken a look back over the past few generations to examine exactly how the female ideals have changed			1
in 1910 , it was all about the @entity15 look : the pouty , curvy woman who personified beauty portrayed by the illustrations of @entity17			1
her physique was tall and slender but with a buxom bosom and large hips ; essentially an 's ' shaped body achieved by wearing a super-cinched corset			1
by 1920 , the flapper girl was well in fashion and a trim figure was all the rage the housewife did not need a personal trainer to keep the surplus pounds at bay			1
in a world before vacuum cleaners and washing machines , housework kept her - and her legs - trim for her short - hemmed dresses by 1920 , the flapper girl was well in fashion			1
times were hard for the @entity51 flapper girl			0
a quarter of a century before the creation of the egalitarian @entity54 , poverty meant many @entity57 adults and children never had enough to eat			0
the housewife did not need a personal trainer to keep the surplus pounds at bay			0
in a world before vacuum cleaners and washing machines , housework kept her trim			0
but while the majority of women had no problem keeping slim , it was the twenties which saw the invention of dieting			2
upper - class women who ate a richer diet and exercised less bought the new women 's magazines which featured weight - loss diets designed to give you that fashionable , streamlined figure that worked so well with the iconic flapper dress			1
hemlines fell in 1930 and curves seeped their way back into fashion with her curvier figure , @entity85 was the sex symbol of the 1930s hemlines fell in 1930 , when morale was low following the stock market crash			1
curves seeped their way back into fashion and women dared to bare their shoulders			1
this slightly more voluptuous look was embraced by the media , which lead nicely into the screen queen era of the 1940s			2
the @entity101 woman was one inch larger all round than the flapper simply because she was better nourished			0
the @entity101 laid the foundation for women becoming taller as the government decreed that every child was entitled to one - third of a pint of milk a day , so promoting the growth of strong bones			2
this continued in schools until @entity114 scrapped it in the 1970s			0
with their men off fighting , fashion changed in the @entity101 and the curvy feminine look to cheer returning heroes became the order of the day again , it was their highly energetic lifestyle that kept @entity101 women slim			1
there was no petrol for cars , and people cycled or walked for miles every day			0
girls thought little of walking ten miles home after a saturday night dance			0
with their men off fighting , fashion changed			2
the curvy feminine look to cheer returning heroes became the order of the day , with fitted suits and belted flowery dresses to show off the waist , and the @entity103 's flattening bodice giving way to the circle - stitched bra			2
those ideals heightened in the @entity143 , when weight gain tablets were promoted in magazines to help women fill out their curves			1
in the @entity143 , weight - gain tablets were promoted in magazines to help women fill out their curves this was a stark contrast to the 1960s , which ushered in a more much gaunt figure popularised by supermodels such as @entity155 and @entity156			1
dresses shrunk to suit the favoured petite frame and women craved smaller busts and tinier hips			2
many women embarked on diets to fulfill their goals and @entity165 was founded - and welcomed - in 1963			2
@entity166 came the curves in 1970 - the era of the long , lean dancing queen			2
@entity170 was the poster girl of this decade and waspish frames were on their way out			0
in the 1960s , dresses shrunk to suit the favoured petite frame as sported by @entity155 the 1960s ushered in a more gaunt figure popularised by supermodels @entity155 , left , and @entity156 @entity166 came the curves in 1970 - the era of the long , lean dancing queen the typical 70s look was embraced by ( @entity180 ) @entity181 , @entity170 and @entity182 by the time the @entity184 came along , the @entity57 woman was well on the way to an irretrievable pear - shape , with her hips measuring two inches more than her bust			0
women idolised the ' supermodels ' of the era - including leggy @entity192 , @entity193 , and @entity194			0
it was , of course , in the @entity184 that exercise classes became fashionable , with women looking to @entity199 in a bid to achieve lithe , muscular bodies			0
alas , despite huge numbers of videos sold and classes attended , the inches continued to increase			0
by the @entity184 , the @entity57 woman was on the way to a healthy figure with @entity192 being the ideal women idolised the ' supermodels ' of the era in the @entity212 - including leggy @entity192 , who became widely known as ' @entity213 ' then came the 1990s - and @entity19			1
the supermodel and pin - up of her time , became known as ' the waif ' and she and fellow catwalk queens such as @entity220 popularised the ' heroin chic ' look , which was gaunt with hollow eyes			0
the look , thankfully , came to an end thanks to @entity226 , who promoted a healthy lifestyle and washboard abs. @entity229 also jumped on the bandwagon and shocked the world when she revealed she completes 600 sit - ups a day to achieve her toned tummy			0
the @entity234 was the decade of ' the waif ' popularised the ' heroin chic ' look seen on @entity19 then came the 1990s - and @entity19 , left , and @entity220			1
the supermodels popularised the ' heroin chic ' look , which was gaunt with hollow eyes by the year 2000 , the pearshape became even more marked , with the average waistsize having ballooned four inches in 20 years			0
