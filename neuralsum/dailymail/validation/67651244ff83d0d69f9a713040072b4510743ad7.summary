@entity0 has insisted the vast majority of @entity2 youngsters will want to play in the @entity4 this summer – but that pressure from club managers can make it difficult			1
@entity0 says that his time with the @entity9 was a huge learning curve , even though when he played in @entity11 - 21 euro 2013 as captain , @entity2 lost all three games in a deeply disappointing tournament			2
@entity0 also played in the 2011 @entity16 under 21 championship , in which @entity2 also failed to win			2
@entity2 midfielder @entity0 played in @entity11 - 21 euro 2013 as captain but with a club versus country row already developing over the availability of @entity22 this summer , @entity0 has urged the current generation to take their chance to play if they can @entity0 said : ‘ i would tell any of those young lads to go out there and play in tournament football for their country at any level			1
‘ i thought i gained a lot of experience doing that			2
it was n’t all good as i had two under - 21 tournaments and we did n’t do that well in either			0
we could have done a lot better with the team we had – but i learnt a lot from playing in those games			0
club versus country row already developing over the availability of @entity22 ‘ there was never any doubt for me			1
all i wanted to do was go and play			0
obviously people get injuries , which you ca n't help , but if you 're fit , i wanted to go			0
you 've got to manage it with the club managers , who think about the best interest of the player			1
and you 've got to understand that			0
but for me personally i want to play every game for club and country and if i 'm fit i 'll want to play at a tournament whatever the level			1
@entity0 says that most of the players do want to play – but that pressure from clubs is the reason why sometimes are withdrawn from age - group squads			1
‘ i 'm not sure it 's players needing convincing , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ if you asked all the lads they 'd want to play			0
but managers of clubs have to manage the player the best they can and their best interest is the player			2
‘ if they feel the player is playing a lot of games and are afraid they 'll burn out , that 's an issue			0
but for me i just wanted to play as much football as i could , whenever for , and though the tournaments did n't turn out how we wanted , i gained a lot of experience			0

club managers could make it difficult for young players this summer
