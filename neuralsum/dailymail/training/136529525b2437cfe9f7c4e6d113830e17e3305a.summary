the @entity0 wrote to the @entity2 @entity1 last year demanding to know the names of all its financial donors and volunteers , as part of a 55 - question inquisition into its application for tax - exempt status , @entity7 has learned			1
the agency wanted to know ' the names of the donors , contributors , and grantors ' for every year ' from inception to the present			1
' it also demanded ' the amounts of each of the donations , contributions , and grants and the dates you received them			0
' ' how did you use these donations , contributions , and grants ? ' the @entity0 asked			2
' please identify your volunteers , ' the january 9 , 2012 letter from the @entity0 read			1
the agency also required the @entity55 conservative group to provide copies of sections of its website that only its members can access			0
the @entity0 came under fire on friday when its office of inspector general released a draft of an investigative timeline showing that the agency had played political favorites with nonprofit groups seeking tax - exempt status			1
in 2010 , according to that investigation , the @entity70 - based @entity0 office responsible for vetting tax - exempt applications began targeting groups with ' @entity1 or similar ' words in their names – including words like ' patriots ' and ' 9/12 ' – for tighter scrutiny			1
the @entity2 @entity1 received this demand along with dozens of others from the @entity0 , asking for a list of its donors and the amounts they had contributed			1
the group refused , citing their donors ' right to privacy the @entity0 ultimately identified approximately 300 such organizations , many of which were independently organized in 2009 and 2010 under the larger ' tea party ' banner			1
those groups had a decisive impact in the 2010 midterm congressional elections , and became a thorn in the side of the @entity99 party , costing it race after race , especially in the @entity101 , which shifted to @entity103 control			0
in the nearly three years since the @entity0 began looking more closely at conservative nonprofit groups than others , 125 of the 300 target organizations have been approved for tax - exempt status			1
another 25 withdrew their applications			0
the remainder are still waiting			0
the @entity112 's timeline shows that in @entity114 , senior officials with the @entity0 were made aware of the practice by at least august 4 , 2011			1
on that date , the chief counsel of the @entity0 met with the agency 's rulings and @entity120 ' so that everyone would have the latest information on the issue			2
' but during a press gaggle about @entity127 on monday , @entity125 press secretary @entity124 insisted the @entity125 was unaware of the investigation or its political implications until last month			1
@entity130 faced questions about the performance of his administration 's @entity0 on monday			2
the @entity125 has said it learned of the @entity0 @entity135 's report on friday , when a copy of an investigative timeline was leaked to reporters the @entity2 @entity1 has organized conservatives in @entity55 's capital region for more than three years , but refused to share its donor and volunteer lists with the @entity0 as a condition of winning tax - exempt status ' my understanding , ' @entity124 told reporters while en route to @entity149 for the president 's appearance at political fundraising events , ' is that the @entity153 was alerted in the week of april 22nd of this year , only about the fact that the @entity135 was finishing a review about matters involving the office in @entity70			1
but that ’s all they were informed as a normal sort of heads - up			0
' ' and we have never – we do n’t have access to , nor should we , the @entity135 ’s report or any draft versions of it			0
' asked whether heads would roll at the @entity0 if the @entity135 's report concludes that there was substantial wrongdoing , @entity124 was cautious			2
' i think you ’re getting ahead of it , ' he told a reporter , according to a transcript released by the @entity125			2
' i think you heard from the president on this today and how he feels about it			0
but the " if " is very important , so we ’re not going to start predicting outcomes if we do n’t know what the conclusions of the @entity135 report are			0
' the @entity181 reported on friday that the @entity0 has apologized for its practices , which sought to scrutinize conservative nonprofit groups ' that criticized the government and sought to educate @entity185 about the @entity185 @entity186			1
' in early 2012 a group of tea party organizations refused the @entity0 's requests for what they considered overreaching information about their operations , instead asking the @entity194 to investigate			1
that committee wrote in june 2012 to the @entity0 inspector general , asking for ' periodic updates ' on its investigation			1
sen. @entity199 demanded the firing of the acting @entity0 commissioner on monday in response to findings of the @entity0 's @entity112 @entity205 chairman rep. @entity204 has vowed that the @entity0 controversy wo n't go away without a complete investigation @entity209 @entity208 rep. @entity208 , who chairs the committee , has promised it will ' aggressively follow up ' on the @entity135 's findings			1
@entity101 majority leader @entity212 said in a statement friday that the @entity0 ' can not target or intimidate any individual or organization based on their political beliefs			2
' ' @entity101 will investigate this matter , ' @entity212 promised			0
add appearing on the @entity221 on sunday , @entity220 @entity219 rep. @entity219 said the @entity0 had ' agents who were engaged in intimidation of political groups			2
' ' i do n't care if you 're a conservative , a liberal , a @entity227 or a @entity103 , ' he said			0
' this should send a chill up your spine			0
it needs to have a full investigation			0
' president @entity130 echoed that sentiment during a press conference on monday , sayign any @entity0 personnel who played political favorites ' have to be held fully accountable			2
... and you should feel that way regardless of party			0
i do n't care whether you 're a @entity227 , independent or a @entity103			0
' ' at some point , there are going to be @entity103 administrations			0
at some point , there are going to be @entity99 ones			0
either way , ' the president said , ' you do n't want the @entity0 ever being perceived to be biased and anything less than neutral in terms of how they operate			2
' @entity1 favorite @entity253 wrote on @entity255 that the ' @entity0 revelation is another step in the unraveling of the @entity130 administration 's self - proclaimed ¿ hope and change			1
" ' @entity1 groups were instrumental in the tide - turning elections of 2010 , when their fervor swept new conservatives to governors ' mansions , statehouses and @entity269 @entity2 @entity1 executive director @entity270 did not immediately respond to a request for comment			1
but in 2012 his organization lashed out at the @entity0 for making ' unreasonable documentation requests			2
' ' this illustrates everything the @entity185 people find unacceptable from their government , ' the group said in a press release			0
' a simple request for tax - exempt status should not take years to complete , involve hundreds of pages of documentation , require hundreds of volunteer hours , and request private information we should never have to disclose			1
' ' this grants the @entity288 the dangerous power to selectively stymie those voices with which they disagree , bogging them down in endless paperwork and compliance costs so that they are unable to spend time serving the principles they founded their organization to advance			0
' the @entity55 organization said it applied for 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) tax - exempt status on december 28 , 2009 and waited nearly 10 months for a response , which consisted of 17 questions and a two - week deadline			1
that demand was made on the opening day of the @entity55 @entity305 , which the @entity2 @entity1 organized in large part			1
' we fully complied , ' the group wrote , ' providing over 500 pages of documentation			0
we received no response for over a year			0
eventually the @entity0 sent a letter dated january 9 , 2012 , thanking us for our " complete and thorough responses " from the first request , ' but then asking 55 more questions in 12 parts – ' including the totally inappropriate request for a full list of our donors and volunteers			1
we were given the same two - week timeframe for completion			0
' @entity0 official @entity323 ( @entity324 ) leads the team tasked with evaluating tax - exempt organizations			1
she has not responded to requests for comment			0
nonprofit attorney @entity329 ( r ) said his tea party clients are ' pissed off ' @entity331 , a nonprofit attorney with the @entity114 firm of @entity333 , told @entity7 that he represents six tea party groups that have been waiting for periods of up to 30 months for the @entity0 to issue rulings			1
' they 're very pissed off , ' he said , ' and they have every right to be pissed off			0
' he advises his clients to refuse to answer invasive questions about their donors and volunteers , he said , since information they provide would be made available to the public			2
' everything these groups tell the @entity0 is open to public inspection once their exempt status is granted , ' @entity329 explained			1
@entity351 sen. @entity199 demanded the ouster of acting @entity0 commissioner @entity353 on monday			2
president @entity130 called the @entity0 's alleged conduct ' outrageous , ' and said the bureaucrats responsible would be ' held accountable			0

lengthy *questionnaire* arrived more than two years after the @entity2 @entity1 applied for tax - exempt status
@entity0 demanded ' names of the donors , contributors , and grantors ' and insisted : ' please identify your volunteers '
tax *collectors* began in 2012 to scrutinize conservative nonprofits more closely than others
documents show senior @entity0 officials in @entity114 knew of the practice as early as august 2011 , but the @entity125 says it learned last month
