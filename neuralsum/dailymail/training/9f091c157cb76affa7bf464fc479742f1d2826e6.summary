by @entity0 festival fever is well and truly upon us , and although i missed out on @entity4 as i 'm filming in the @entity5 , i 'll definitely be digging out the @entity6 on my return as there are some awesome smaller @entity10 events coming up i simply ca n't miss. last year top celebrity makeup artist @entity11 created a gorgeous boho - style floral festival look for me , which you can check out here			1
this year i 've enlisted @entity11 's help once more , but this time we 've gone for something altogether different – a @entity17 party look that blends @entity19 grunge - glam and futuristic cool			1
here 's how we did it			0
@entity11 recommended the @entity34 – the coverage is enough to conceal any pesky blemishes while still allowing your skin to breathe			0
it 's easy to apply too – simply blend into the face with your fingertips , making sure to take the product down the neck to avoid tidemarks			0
@entity43 a black kohl pencil ( waterproof , of course ! ) is a foolproof festival essential – whatever the look you 're going for			1
so next , @entity11 lined my eyes generously with his @entity50 in @entity51			0
' festival make - up needs to have a little bit of edge , ' he explained , ' so to give the eyes a bit more attitude i smudged the liner out slightly with my @entity59 for a slept - in effect that screams rock'n'roll			2
' @entity0 enlisted the help of make - up artist , @entity11 for her bold and bright beauty look step 3 - @entity66 @entity11 then loaded some of the @entity68 in @entity69 onto a smudger brush and gently dabbed it over my eyelids			1
the contrast of the shimmering lilac hue and the black eyeliner provides the perfect blend of girly and edgy			2
he also applied some to the tops of my cheekbones for a super-cool holographic effect and across my lips to create the illusion of a fuller pout			0
the mantra ' less is more ' certainly does n't apply to festival make - up – so feel free to go as wild as you like			2
a little does go a long way with this pigment , though ! step 4 - @entity93 instead of using a boring black mascara , @entity11 decided to mix things up a bit and go for a vivid fuschia shade - in the form of @entity99 's @entity100 – to really make the lashes pop. @entity11 says that festival make - up has to have a bit more edge and attitude than a day - to - day look a statement look like this calls for suitably bold brows , so @entity11 defined and darkened mine using his @entity111 waterproof eye pencil , sweeping the colour through my brows with a small brush for added volume			1
step 5 - after glow to give my skin a rosy - radiant glow , @entity11 swept his @entity120 across the apples of my cheeks			0
this pretty palette offers the perfect blend of golden and peachy tones to instantly perk up even the most hungover of complexions - plus the dark shade doubles up as a great contour colour			2
finally , @entity11 painted my pout with @entity130 in @entity131 – a bold lilac shade providing a matte but moisturising wash of colour			0
@entity0 opted for a bright fuchsia shade of mascara to make her eyes really pop so there you have it ; a rave - ready festival look that will certainly make sure you stand out from the crowd - thanks @entity11 ! i also thought i 'd share with you my top five festival essentials in case any of you are off to a festival soon and are a bit stuck on what to pack in the beauty department			1
you can get everything i 've mentioned from @entity153			0
@entity0 gives you her top five festival beauty essentials @entity157 – the ultimate festival hair saviour @entity160 50 – sunburn at a festival is no fun ! @entity164 – conceals dark circles like a dream @entity167 – easy to apply for a healthy flush of colour @entity170 – a different ultra-pigmented lip shade for every night see you next week , @entity174 xxx			1
