there ’s nothing better than a succulent steak , sizzling from the hot plate , charred to perfection on the outside , bursting with juices within			1
people often get it wrong when cooking this cut of meat and end up with an overdone dish that ’s bone dry , grey - hued and distinctly unappetising			1
he told @entity35 : ‘ it ’s best to speak to your local butcher and pay a little bit extra and reap the rewards when eating it			2
’ and while we all stress about the cooking times for steak , he advises in checking the temperature of the meat before you start preparing your meal			1
' one of the most important steps in cooking the perfect steak that is often forgotten or never thought about , is to allow your meat to come to room temperature first			1
' this will shorten the cooking time and help to prevent grey rings from happening , ' mr @entity25 continued			1
your steak should have a fine texture , be well marbled ( veins of fat running through the meat ) and firm to the touch			1
the shape and thickness of the steak is also important ; the best steaks are one to 1.5 - inches thick as a thinner cut is likely to get dry quicker			1
‘ the texture will depend on the quality of the beef and the cut ; fillet has the best texture but the least flavour , whereas ribeye has more flavour and more fat , less texture but more flavour , ' the chef said			1
‘ when it comes to the shape of the steak , try and keep it flat and a decent thickness			1
‘ too thin a steak will be easy to overcook			1
also try to keep the shape the same throughout the whole steak as this will help to keep the cooking consistent			1
a rib - eye ( pictured ) has more fat and more flavour but less texture some people like theirs blue while others do n’t want to see any pink in their meat			1
but what are the perfect timings to cook steak the way you like it ? if you are unsure , it 's best to speak to your butcher as they will be able to give you the best advice based on the thickness and cut of meat			1
the cooking times below are for a 2cm thick sirloin steak blue : 1 minute each side			1
the steak should be just warm and fell spongy under your fingertips			1
meat should still be dark in colour rare : 1.5 minutes per side			2
dark red with some juice			2
there will be some resistance when you press the meat but it should still feel soft and bouncy medium rare : 2 minutes per side			2
@entity124 meat with pink juice			0
@entity127 , soft and spongy			0
medium : 2.5 mins per side			0
your meat will be mostly cooked with only pink in the middle			0
the steak will feel firm			1
well - done : 4 to 5 minutes			0
there will be hardly any pink and the meat should have a bouncy , firm feel			0
but which cuts are the best ? or do they all have their own strengths ? ' the cut depends on individual preference , ' he said			0
' the most important thing is to look out for marbling			0
marbling is a great way to tell the quality of the meat			0
the more marbling a piece of steak has means the more moist it will be			1
marbling means your steak is full of mono saturated fatty acid , proven to reduce cholesterol levels			1
it also has a low melting point , thus giving you the melt - in - the - mouth effect			0
when seasoning , mr @entity25 advises using coarse salt			1
‘ when seasoning the beef , i would place the beef on the grill and season the top with a coarse salt ; either rock salt or @entity171 is good			0
‘ the steak will absorb the salt and when you flip it the excess salt will fall off , which means you can season the other side			1
cook your steak on a grill and only flip it over once , he said			2
' for me the best way to cook a steak is straight on the grill			2
charcoal and wood will give you the most flavour and smokiness but if you have a gas bbq that will do as well			0
' ideally you should only flip your steak once , ' he continued			2
and while we ’ve all been told various cooking times for the perfect steak , mr @entity25 says there are too many variables to have anything set in stone			1
‘ cooking times will vary depending on the size of the steak , whether it is room temperature , how hot your grill is			1
' there are too many variables to give a specific cooking time , ’ he said			2

@entity25 head chef at @entity30 and @entity31 shares his *expertise*
the more fat your steak contains the more juicy it will be after cooking
look for thickness rather than *weight* when choosing which steak to buy
