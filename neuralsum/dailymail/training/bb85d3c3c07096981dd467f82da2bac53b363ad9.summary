during a thursday hearing , sen. @entity0 suggested that former @entity3 administrator @entity2 was following precedent by setting up an email alias to conduct official government business			1
but the researcher who uncovered @entity10 's ' @entity9 ' alias account last year said @entity10 's habit of hiding some of her official correspondence was both unprecedented and illegal			1
the @entity3 's inspector general is investigating whether @entity10 was attempting to shield her activities from @entity16 and from citizen requests under the @entity18			1
the question was raised during a hearing on the confirmation of @entity22 to serve as the agency 's next administrator former epa administrator @entity2 resigned in december , shortly before the agency started providing a @entity18 requester with copies of emails linked to a phony ' @entity9 ' account she used for some official business according to a memo the @entity3 sent to the @entity33 in 2008 , it was standard practice for top officials to have two email accounts , in part to help them distinguish between urgent communications and garden - variety emails that flooded their in - boxes every day			1
clinton administration @entity3 administrator @entity41 and her successors used secondary email addresses that were related to their official identities in the @entity3 's computer systems			1
but @entity49 ( @entity48 ) senior fellow @entity47 told @entity50 that @entity10 , who resigned in december , broke with tradition and created an entirely new identity so that she could conduct some correspondence in secret			2
' i found the memo and revealed it in my book , ' @entity47 said , ' and then @entity48 sued the @entity3 for the " @entity9 " emails			2
' ' @entity3 's final document production deadline in that lawsuit is april 15th , ' he explained , ' and then we 'll be before a judge to argue about thousands of pages that @entity3 is withholding			2
' ' they owed us 12,000 emails , and they provided 2,000 per month when they were required to give us 3,000			0
we do n't expect them to comply with the law any more than they have been already			0
' @entity71 sen. @entity0 suggested that @entity73 - era @entity3 leaders also used fake email accounts , including one with the @entity75			1
' @entity49 senior fellow @entity47 ( r ) uncovered @entity3 's history of providing its top officials with secondary email accounts			1
in a @entity83 hearing @entity81 @entity80 explained that @entity2 took that practice into uncharted territory in an attempt to diffuse what became a spirited debate with @entity89 @entity80 sen. @entity80 , @entity0 provided examples of @entity73 administration @entity3 officials who had their own secondary email addresses			1
@entity3 chief @entity93 , she said , used the alias ' @entity94			0
' administrator @entity96 used ' @entity97			0
' @entity98 , an acting administrator in 2003 , had an email alias called ' @entity100			0
' and bush - era acting administrator @entity101 used ' tofu			2
' ' all of them have used it , ' @entity0 said			0
' i do n't think it is anything nefarious			0
' @entity47 and sen. @entity80 both called the argument nonsense			0
@entity22 , an assistant administrator with the @entity3 , will take the agency 's top job if the @entity83 confirms her vegetarian emails ? @entity0 revealed that @entity101 ( @entity114 ) once an acting @entity3 administrator in the @entity73 administration , used a secondary address with the alias ' tofu ' ' the claim that " everybody does it " is utterly unfounded , ' @entity47 told @entity50 , ' and no one has provided any support for that claim			1
' ' @entity10 created a second identity for the purpose of conducting some official communications , and that 's both unprecedented and a violation of the @entity128			1
' the @entity3 has said it followed a policy requiring the disclosure that ' @entity9 ' was an alias for @entity2			1
@entity80 said in the hearing thursday that he had obtained copies of emails between ' @entity135 ' and @entity22 that provided no information about @entity135 's true identity			0
' the email alias " @entity9 " does not comply with the rules , ' @entity80 said during thursday 's hearing			2
' i wonder if anyone at the @entity3 objected , ' he asked @entity22 , ' or if you personally objected to epa administrator @entity2 using an alias that was absolutely against the policy of the @entity3 ? and your emails back to her go back to 2009			1
' ' i think it â€™s important for all of us to know if the @entity3 and this administration is going to be transparent , ' he continued , ' or is intentionally deciding to try to deceive the @entity153 people			0
' @entity3 administrator @entity93 ( @entity114 ) used the email alias was ' @entity155 ' and acting administrator @entity98 ( r ) used ' @entity100			2
' their accounts , unlike recently - resigned administrator @entity2 's , were linked to their actual identities @entity73 - era epa administrator @entity96 ( @entity114 ) used ' @entity97 ' as his secondary email name			1
@entity161 ( r ) was an assistant @entity3 administrator in the @entity163 administration , and is now acting administrator under @entity165			0
sen. @entity0 did not say what his alias was in the 1990s , or if he uses one now @entity170 @entity169 sen. @entity169 cracked a joke about ' @entity135 , ' calling it ' pretty monarchist			0
' ' now , a lot of folks would say that is appropriate for @entity3 , he quipped , ' but i personally vote for tofu			0
i think that is more on the mark ' for an agency known for embracing liberal politics			0
' i 'm a meat - eater myself , ' @entity22 replied , to chuckles from the gallery			0
@entity47 first exposed the practice of @entity3 leaders obscuring their official communication through fake email aliases , in his 2012 book @entity190			2
to date , no evidence has emerged that other federal agencies have similar policies			0
the @entity3 wrote in its 2008 memo to the @entity33 that the secondary email accounts up to that time were all intact or suffered ' minimal ' archiving losses			1
it 's unclear how much of @entity2 's ' @entity9 ' account has been deleted , since the agency has n't yet complied with @entity47 's @entity18 request in full			1
@entity3 also wrote that @entity41 , the first administrator given the option of a secondary email account , ' reportedly ' never made use of hers			1
@entity47 said he 's skeptical of that , calling it in a 2012 op - ed ' simply an assertion , one @entity3 elected not to check			2
' a spokesperson for sen. @entity0 referred an email from @entity50 to @entity214 committee staff , who declined to speak on the record for this story			0
in this 2008 letter to the @entity33 , the @entity3 acknowledged that it had been providing officials with extra email accounts , and that some of the emails in those accounts had been deleted			2

@entity226 @entity71 senator cited @entity73 - era @entity3 chiefs who had secondary email addresses
those *bureaucrats* followed an @entity3 policy that linked extra accounts to their official identities
@entity2 resigned from @entity3 's top post after her ' @entity9 ' alias was exposed
researcher who found the account says @entity10 created an entirely new @entity3 *employee* *profile* to shield her correspondence from the *public*
