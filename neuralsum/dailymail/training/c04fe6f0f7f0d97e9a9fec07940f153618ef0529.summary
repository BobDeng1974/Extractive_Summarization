it ’s the house where virtually nothing is in a straight line			2
but although it may look like something out of @entity4 , for the past 13 years it has been the perfect cosy sanctuary for millionaire @entity6			1
set against the slate - grey mountains of @entity9 in @entity10 , it ’s not surprising that so many people do a double - take when they first see the house near the village of @entity14			1
‘ they usually stand outside looking stunned , ’ admits @entity6 , 64 , who had the house built			1
‘ many assume it ’s some kind of strange ancient farmhouse , which is a simple mistake to make because it looks so comfortable in its surroundings			2
’ natural look : @entity23 , set against @entity9 , took three years to complete thanks to its complex design @entity6 went to enormous trouble to capture this natural look , interviewing six architects before finding the one who impressed him			1
that was @entity31 , a sculptor with a keen interest in ecology			2
‘ i loved his philosophy that a well - designed building should have a sense of soul , ’ explains @entity6			1
realising this vision , though , was no small task , with the property – called @entity41 – taking three years to create			2
whereas normal houses are variations on a box shape , this one is all bends and soft corners , with very few right angles			1
its geometry is very complex : walls melt into the ceilings , skirting boards are often curved , and the roof zigzags into peaks and slopes			1
determined : millionaire businessman @entity6 went to enormous trouble to capture the house 's natural look , interviewing six architects before finding the one who impressed him ‘ the interior owes everything to the carpenter , @entity63 , ’ says @entity6			1
‘ he enjoyed the work because it gave him the opportunity to think outside the box			0
i ’d say , “ what would you do if you really could ? ” and he ’d come up with answers			0
’ following a hunch and backing his instincts is typical of @entity6 , who in business terminology is a ‘ dragon ’ – someone who buys and improves firms before selling and moving on			1
@entity77 : £ 985,000 location : @entity14 , @entity79 bedrooms : five unique features : @entity83 ‘ wonky ’ design , @entity79 ash staircase , spectacular views of @entity9 he set up his first such venture , @entity88 , a company selling healthy snacks , in the 1970s			1
initially with a workforce of just five , he developed it over six years before selling it to @entity94			0
later , when @entity95 was threatened with closure , he bought it back , then sold out for a second time in 2004 , by which time he had 500 people on the payroll			0
he is reluctant to talk about his wealth but it is obviously considerable			0
a noted philanthropist , he has given more than £ 400,000 to local causes in the past ten years			0
everything about @entity23 ’s interior feels bespoke			2
open the front door and you find a rounded reception hall , with a superb @entity79 ash staircase leading up to a gallery			0
the ground floor is built into the natural terrain , so the living room area is on a split level , with @entity116 windows opening on to terraces from which there are gorgeous views			2
well rounded : the property has a stunning hall with a @entity79 ash staircase and offers spectacular views of @entity9 there are two bedrooms on the ground floor – one with steps leading to a mezzanine sleeping area above a study , the other more conventional in layout			1
there are three more bedrooms upstairs , all with their own individually designed bathrooms			0
however , it is @entity23 ’s location that is its main attraction			0
it nestles amid hillocks , with the mountains of southern @entity9 as a backdrop			1
the house has received many plaudits , notably from sir @entity144 , the former @entity145 chairman , who described it as ‘ an outstanding example of @entity149 craftsmanship in wood ’			2
@entity6 and his wife @entity151 , 64 , have enjoyed good times here			1
apart from family get - togethers with his three sons , it was while living here that he became involved in his most satisfying business venture to date			0
called @entity159 , it is a medical refrigeration company that helps keep vaccines in top condition , even in areas with erratic power supplies			0
it is a project that should save millions of lives in years to come – hence the involvement of @entity167 founder @entity166 , whose charitable foundation is heavily involved in healthcare overseas			0
‘ it has been a wonderful house – like living inside a sculpture , ’ says @entity6 , who is selling for £ 985,000			1
‘ but now i want to move to the @entity173 or @entity174 area where our sons , their wives and our grandchildren live			0
’ @entity179 , 01743 284200			0

@entity6 went to great *lengths* to have *extraordinary* house built
the property is set against the mountains of @entity9 in @entity10
the interior is mostly bends and soft corners with very few right angles
home 's walls melt into ceilings and roof zigzags into peaks and slopes
