@entity3 could soon be using rockets powered by poo , it has been claimed			0
researchers have been working with @entity3 to develop a system to repurpose human waste on a moonbase			1
they say the system would produce enough fuel for the return trip to @entity10			1
the @entity13 team created an anaerobic digester process , which kills pathogens from human waste , and produces biogas - a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide by breaking down organic matter in waste			1
they found the process could produce 290 liters of methane per crew per day			2
the digestion process also would produce about 200 gallons of non-potable water annually from all the waste			2
through electrolysis , the water can then be split into hydrogen and oxygen , and the astronauts can breathe the oxygen as a back - up system			0
currently human waste is stored and sent back to @entity10 on cargo vehicles than burn up in the atmosphere in 2006 , @entity3 began making plans to build an inhabited facility on the moon 's surface between 2019 and 2024			1
as part of @entity3 's moon - base goal , the agency wanted to reduce the weight of spacecraft leaving @entity10			2
historically , waste generated during spaceflight would not be used further			0
@entity3 stores it in containers until it 's loaded into space cargo vehicles that burn as they pass back through the @entity10 's atmosphere			2
for future long - term missions , though , it would be impractical to bring all the stored waste back to @entity10			1
dumping it on the moon 's surface is not an option , so the space agency entered into an agreement with @entity68 to develop test ideas			0
' we were trying to find out how much methane can be produced from uneaten food , food packaging and human waste , ' said @entity75 , a @entity68 associate professor of agricultural and biological engineering			1
' the idea was to see whether we could make enough fuel to launch rockets and not carry all the fuel and its weight from @entity10 for the return journey			1
' methane can be used to fuel the rockets			2
' enough methane can be produced to come back from the moon			0
' @entity3 started by supplying the @entity68 scientists with a packaged form of chemically produced human waste that also included simulated food waste , towels , wash cloths , clothing and packaging materials , @entity75 said			1
he and @entity97 , now a doctoral student at the @entity96 , ran laboratory tests to find out how much methane could be produced from the waste and how quickly			0
researchers say the system could create enough fuel to bring astronauts back from the moon they found the process could produce 290 liters of methane per crew per day , all produced in a week , @entity75 said			1
their results led to the creation of an anaerobic digester process , which kills pathogens from human waste , and produces biogas -- a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide by breaking down organic matter in waste			1
in earth - bound applications , that fuel could be used for heating , electricity generation or transportation			0
the digestion process also would produce about 200 gallons of non-potable water annually from all the waste			0
that is water held within the organic matter , which is released as organic matter decomposes			0
through electrolysis , the water can then be split into hydrogen and oxygen , and the astronauts can breathe oxygen as a back - up system			0
the exhaled carbon dioxide and hydrogen can be converted to methane and water in the process , he said			0
the process could also turn up on @entity10 , @entity142 could be used on campus or around town , or anywhere , to convert waste into fuel , ' @entity75 said			1
the study was published last month in the journal advances in @entity150 .			0

scheme *collects* methane from human waste and turns in into fuel
*microbes* digest the waste to create biogas which can power a rocket
system could also be developed on @entity10 to produce biogas
