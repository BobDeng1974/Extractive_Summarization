@entity6 , a steel engineer , said he spent most of his time on the cruise ' being ill and feeling weak ' in a statement , a spokesperson for @entity27 said : ' @entity75 is the most common cause of stomach bugs in @entity77 and @entity78 and according to @entity80 @entity77 outbreaks are common in semi-enclosed environments such as hospitals , nursing homes , schools , restaurants and hotels			1
