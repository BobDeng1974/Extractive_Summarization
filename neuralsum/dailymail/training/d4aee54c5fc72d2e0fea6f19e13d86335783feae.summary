published : 12:53 est , 3 august 2013 updated : 10:37 est , 5 august 2013 how about this for a tall tale ? this critically endangered baby giraffe was born at @entity3 yesterday to the delight of her keepers			1
the female nipper was born out in the reserve in less than two hours , with all of the herd taking a keen interest			1
they carefully surrounded the new infant , not only to welcome her in to the world , but to instinctively protect her with their formidable presence			1
the calf , which was born to mother @entity22 , has not yet been named			1
it was @entity22 's third calf , and she will spend the next 13 months weaning her			2
once she has found her feet , she will have the freedom to roam a seven - acre section of the park along with the rest of the herd , which they share with @entity45 and @entity46			2
she will spend the rest of the warm summer months sleeping outside , but will be spared @entity48 's bitter winter months when she and the rest of the herd are brought in at night			0
overseeing her young : fully grown giraffes have few predators in the wild , but calves can be hunted by big cats , such as lions and leopards , as well as packs of hyenas although the new giraffe is only a snip at the moment , when she is fully grown he will stand a proud 20ft tall ( 6m ) and will live to about 20 years old			1
@entity3 spokeswoman @entity64 said : ' she was born naturally yesterday at 2.40pm in the paddock			1
' she 's already 6ft tall			1
she was born to parents @entity68 and @entity22			2
endangered : the birth of the @entity72 is great news for the subspecies as there are just 600 left in the wild ' we wo n't give her a name until after about a week , but it will begin with an " n " - every year we name our new - born animals with a new letter and this year it 's " n "			1
' it 's the second birth we 've had this year and the herd is now up to 14 with the latest addition			0
' at the moment she 's just sheltering , nosing around in the grass and getting used to her new surroundings			0
she 's feeding on milk from her mother			0
' the birth is the latest success story the @entity95 wildlife park has enjoyed in breeding this endangered subspecies of @entity72 there are believed to be just 600 left in the wild and the park is playing a key role in safeguarding their future			1
the species used to be abundant in @entity104 , but their numbers have dwindled to just 13 herds across @entity107 and @entity108			2
they are now extinct in @entity110			0
a combination of habitat loss and poaching has led to their demise			0
now a protected species , they used to be hunted for their tails			2
they typically favour open grassland , scrub and woodlands			0
their long necks allow them to feed on leaves from taller trees such as acacia and wild apricots			0
they also eat shoots , fruit and other vegetation			0
according to website @entity136 , the subspecies was first named by lord @entity137 , a zoologist and member of the famous banking family following an expedition to @entity104 in the early 1900s			0
the @entity72 is sometimes also known as the @entity142 giraffe or the @entity107 giraffe and is easily distinguished from other giraffe subspecies by its unique appearance			1
they are lighter in colour , their patches are less jagged and they have no markings below the knees as if they are wearing cream socks , making them easy to recognise .			0

home - grown success in *battle* to protect an endangered species of giraffe
the @entity72 was born naturally in less than two hours
