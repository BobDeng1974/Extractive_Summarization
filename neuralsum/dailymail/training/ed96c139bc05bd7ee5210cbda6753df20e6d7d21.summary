@entity1 is set to suffer more severe droughts due to climate change and increased water use , scientists have warned			2
by the end of the century , southern @entity1 in particular will have 80 per cent more droughts than at present			1
new research by the @entity9 predicts that water shortages will be made worse by population growth and increased demand			1
new research by the @entity9 predicts that water shortages will be made worse by population growth and increased demand			1
it said that in the past 30 years , dry spells have cost @entity1 over @entity16 ( or £ 83billion ) the researchers predicted that southern @entity1 will probably be worst hit			2
@entity18 and river minimum flow levels could fall by as much as 40 per cent and periods of drought might increase up to 80 per cent in the @entity23 , the south of @entity24 , @entity25 and the @entity26			1
scientists have predicted that dry spells will be longer and more frequent and warned that the warming projected for @entity1 - particularly in its southern regions - is even stronger			2
over the @entity23 , the average temperature is predicted to increase by up to 5 ° c by the end of this century			0
drought can have a serious economic and social impact and is thought to have cost @entity1 over € 100billion ( or £ 83billion ) in the past three decades alone			0
researchers used computer models to predict which parts of @entity1 could be worst hit by increasing temperatures and intensive water consumption			0
@entity40 , a researcher in climate risk at the @entity9 's @entity42 said : ‘ our research shows that many river basins , especially in southern parts of @entity1 , are likely to become more prone to periods of reduced water supply due to climate change			1
‘ an increasing demand for water , following a growing population and intensive use of water for irrigation and industry , will result in even stronger reductions in river flow levels			1
’ they analysed climate and hydrological models of different scenarios stretching to the year 2100			0
@entity62 , a hydrologist at the @entity9 said : ‘ scenarios are narratives of possible evolutions - up to 2100 in this study - of our society that we use to quantify future greenhouse gas emissions and water consumption by different sectors			0
@entity18 and river minimum flow levels could fall by as much as 40 per cent and periods of drought might increase up to 80 per cent in the @entity23 ( @entity76 is pictured ) , south of @entity24 , @entity25 and the @entity26 ‘ climate and water - use models then translate the greenhouse gas concentrations and water requirement into future climate and water consumption projections			1
’ the scientists used these projected conditions to make a hydrological model of all river basins in @entity1 that mimics the distribution and flow of water			0
they found that parts of @entity1 will be the most affected			0
@entity18 and river minimum flow levels could fall by as much as 40 per cent and periods of drought might increase up to 80 per cent in the @entity23 , south of @entity24 , @entity25 and the @entity26			1
the research , published in the journal @entity96 and @entity97 also found that average global temperatures will increase by up to 3.4 ° c by 2100			0
scientists have predicted that dry spells will be longer and more frequent and warned that the warming projected for @entity1 - particularly in its southern regions - is even stronger			2
' over the @entity23 , for example , summer mean temperature is projected to increase by up to 5 ° c by the end of this century , ' dr @entity62 added .			0
