@entity1 's historic peace - deal with @entity2 after 50 years of cold war hostility was a breakthrough not to be sniffed at			1
but that did n't stop the @entity7 president having a try , when he got close and personal to a @entity2 on wednesday ... not a citizen , but a cigar			2
significantly , it was the first time in 52 years that a @entity7 president has officially savoured the @entity2 delicacy since @entity14 stockpiled a secret stash of his favourite havanas in the hours before he imposed a trade embargo on the communist state in 1962			1
this , of course , does n't include @entity22 's adventures with cigars and @entity24 in the @entity25			0
he took it in his hand and waved it in the air before running it under his nose for a whiff			0
the room fell near - silent as he paused to take in its aroma , before declaring it ' pretty good ' to everyone 's relief			2
' i had the unique distinction of gifting the @entity54 with one of @entity2 's finest cigars , a @entity57 at the @entity29 … after a ceremony in which a @entity59 was lit , ' @entity49 , who offered the cigar to the president on wednesday , told @entity60			1
he had packed just one cigar for the event , but felt compelled to present it to @entity1 in celebration of the deal to begin normalising relations between the @entity7 and @entity2 , after 18 months of secret talks over prisoner releases brought a sudden end to decades of tension			1
' pretty good ' : the room fell near - silent as he paused to take in its aroma , before declaring it ' pretty good ' to everyone 's relief when @entity49 handed the cigar to @entity1 , he said : ' mr. president , a @entity2 cigar for you ! ' ' oh , nice ! ' @entity1 replied as he lifted the cigar to his nose			1
' the finest , ' @entity49 replied			0
the president approved , telling @entity49 , ' pretty good ! ' @entity82 , who was also a guest at the event and shot the video , added , ' the president definitely looked like he appreciated a good @entity2 cigar			1
' it is unclear whether @entity1 kept the gift or handed it to the @entity89			2
legal again : president @entity1 lifted some of @entity7 's sanctions against @entity2 on wednesday , making it legal for @entity7 who travel there to bring back a limited supply of cigars the president 's smoking habits have long been in the news			1
@entity1 last year told a @entity101 official that he had n't smoked a cigarette in years — mostly because of first lady @entity104			1
' i have n't had a cigarette in probably six years , ' @entity1 was overhead telling @entity107 at the @entity108 in @entity109 back in september 2013			2
' that 's because i 'm scared of my wife			0
' in 2009 , the president said he was a ' former smoker ' but he would ' constantly struggle ' with kicking the habit			0
' have i fallen off the wagon sometimes ? yes , ' he confessed at a press conference in 2009			0
' am i a daily smoker , a constant smoker ? no. ' i do n't do it in front of my kids , i do n't do it in front of my family , ' he added			0
' and , you know , i would say that i am 95 percent cured			0
but there are times where ... there are times where i mess up			0
' @entity104 in february 2011 said her husband stopped smoking about a year earlier			2
president @entity14 was partial to a puff and even asked his press secretary to buy him 1,000 of his favorite @entity2 cigars in the hours before he imposed the @entity2 trade embargo @entity1 is not the first @entity7 president to enjoy a @entity2 cigar on occasion			1
it emerged this week that president @entity14 ordered his press secretary on february 2 , 1962 to buy him as many of his favorite @entity2 cigars as he could lay his hands on – and held off signing the @entity2 trade embargo until his precious stogies were safely inside the @entity29			1
@entity14 asked @entity145 to find at least 1,000 @entity147 petit coronas , and gave him just a half - day to accomplish the task before they would become contraband			0
the next morning , @entity145 recalled in rare video footage of his storytelling , he reported that he had bought up 1,200 of @entity2 's finest exports – a feat the president pronounced ' fantastic ! ' just before he signed a decree that banned all the communist country 's products from the @entity7 @entity159 already had some limited sanctions in place , but @entity14 's decision was the beginning of a comprehensive ban on @entity7 trade with the island that remained intact until wednesday			1
in 1996 the @entity168 law tightened the sanctions further			0
but president @entity1 made a shocking move on wednesday to reopen relations with @entity2 and establish an embassy there			2
that means @entity7 who travel to @entity174 – and there will be thousands – ' will be able to return to the @entity7 with some @entity2 products , including cohibas and other @entity2 cigars , ' according to @entity181 magazine .			0

@entity1 was attending the @entity183 on wednesday
hours after the historic peace deal with @entity2 , a guest handed him a cigar
he ran it under his nose before guests and declared it ' pretty good '
@entity14 ordered secretary to stockpile cigars before signing embargo in 1962
@entity1 has said he struggles with *tobacco* *addiction* and has sneaked the occasional cigarette despite quitting years ago
the president has said he stays away from smoking because he 's *terrified* of first lady @entity104
