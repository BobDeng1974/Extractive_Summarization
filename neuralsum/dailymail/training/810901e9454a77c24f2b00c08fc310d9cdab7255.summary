@entity0 is one of the best right - backs @entity2 manager @entity1 has ever coached			1
calls are growing for the highly - talented 23 - year - old to follow in the footsteps of @entity2 team - mates past and present by getting @entity9 recognition			1
@entity0 has improved markedly since arriving at @entity10 's in 2012 , and has been a key component in what has been the @entity14 's tightest defence this term			1
@entity0 scored a long - range effort for @entity2 against @entity17 in the @entity18 @entity0 ( centre ) celebrates with team - mates after his wonder strike for the @entity2 at the @entity22 @entity1 has praised full - back @entity0 @entity2 boss @entity1 knows a thing or two about defending himself and has seen few better than the former @entity25 full - back			1
' in my opinion , @entity0 is one of the best right full - backs that i 've had in my teams during the last 15 years , ' he said			1
' that means a lot because i like to play with offensive right and left full - backs and he has that qualities , he 's fast and gives good crosses			1
' i 'm happy but i 'm not in the position to tell the national coach of somebody else about him			2
' he shows his quality from the beginning of the season and if he continues like that he will get a call , for sure			2
' if he shows his qualities game by game , then i 'm sure he will get finally a call to be a national player			2
' @entity0 and his team - mates have conceded just three top - flight goals so far this term and head into this weekend 's clash with @entity55 second in the @entity14			1
@entity0 ( right ) battles with @entity57 during @entity2 's match against @entity17 only @entity59 are above @entity2 and , despite them having conceded seven goals , @entity1 pointed to @entity61 as the mentality to replicate			1
' to win points , to win games , it starts at the back , ' he said			2
' it starts in the defence			0
' that 's the reason that we bought @entity71 because he is a fantastic goalkeeper with a future in the club			0
' we have a strong defence			0
it 's all about organisation in the team and one time a week we do unit training			0
we make three groups and we have training for the defenders , for midfielders and for forwards			0
' that is an example of how we try to do work the whole week			0
building a house you do n't start at the top , you start at the bottom			0
@entity0 ( right ) first impressed while at @entity25 - pictured battling @entity93 's @entity92 he also played for @entity25 in the @entity18 against @entity94 ' @entity61 has shown that for a long time in the way he is doing that			1
' judging by that , @entity55 look to be in for a tough season given they have conceded 11 goals already , with eight of those coming in their two away games			2
saints will be looking for a similarly big win on saturday , with the pressure likely to come on the west @entity108 ' defence as the hosts go for a sixth successive win in all competitions			0
@entity112 is a key figure for @entity55 at the back and a player @entity1 rejected suggestions he had moved to bring in during the summer from @entity117			1
the @entity118 also denied having an interest in compatriot @entity120 , who he spent a brief spell coaching at @entity122 before the midfielder moved onto @entity124 , @entity125 and , now , the @entity55 ' we have enough midfield players , ' @entity1 said			1
' that 's not the position where we have to look for new players			0
' he 's a great player			0
i have him as the coach and i know his qualities			0
he 's still a young player , but with a lot of potential and that 's true			0
' @entity0 has taken his impressive performances in the @entity138 , to the @entity14			2
