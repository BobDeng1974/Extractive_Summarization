@entity0 would agree that he became something of a scapegoat at @entity3 last season			1
it was so tough , in fact , that he says he had to call on the support of his family to endure the considerable pressure			1
the one major signing @entity11 was able to make as @entity3 ’s new manager , @entity0 found himself under more scrutiny than he perhaps should have been when he was far from alone in performing below his usual high standards			1
@entity11 had sympathy for the midfielder he lured from @entity17 , saying as much in a column in the @entity19 earlier this month			1
asked if he did feel like a ‘ scapegoat ’ last season , ’ he replied : ‘ yes , a little bit			1
’ but sensitive to where a discussion of the issue might lead him , he then said : ‘ that is a difficult question			1
it is difficult to answer that			1
’ but it was a difficult time for him too			1
‘ i agree last season was tough , ’ he said			1
‘ there was a new manager and it was difficult for all the players			1
‘ my family helped me through it			1
but i did n’t lose faith in myself			1
in football you have to be strong in the head			2
the mentality is important and i do have this quality so i can keep going			2
’ @entity0 celebrates scoring @entity3 's first goal during a 2 - 2 draw against @entity56 in october the 26 - year - old impressed as @entity25 's side held @entity59 leaders @entity60 at @entity61 some strong displays for @entity63 in the @entity64 also helped to heal any mental scars			1
‘ i was also in the national team for @entity63 at the @entity64 and i played well and the team also played well , ’ he said			2
‘ for my confidence that was important			2
‘ i came back after the summer confident			2
the manager said to me i would have to fight if i wanted to play			2
i did fight and trained hard and that was it			2
when i got my chance i tried to show myself and tried to do my best			2
‘ last season was a difficult season for me			1
the @entity64 helped me a lot			0
the manager of the national team and the players helped me and it was a great experience for everybody			0
’ @entity0 would prefer to move on from a season that became more difficult when @entity11 was sacked only 10 months after signing him			1
‘ @entity11 knew my qualities , ’ he said			0
‘ that is why he bought me			0
he knew what i can do and that is why i am here			0
but i am happier now i am playing			0
when you are playing you are always happy			0
but i have worked hard and i will work hard to play every game			0
’ the big midfielder is yet to return to the form which made him such a key player for @entity17 @entity0 was seen as a scapegoat for @entity11 ' ( right ) poor spell as @entity3 manager the former @entity17 man spent the majority of last season on the @entity61 bench if there was speculation about his future during the summer , @entity0 said he had no doubts he would still be at @entity3 this season			1
‘ it was all speculation , ’ he said			0
‘ in football it is like this			0
but i signed for @entity3 for four years and the manager never said to me that i had to go , so i worked for my place and that was it			1
‘ i am fit now and that is why i am better			0
when i am super fit i will be better i am sure			0
i was injured earlier this season ( he had an ankle injury )			2
they said i had to have surgery but i did n’t			0
' it was a bad injury but now i am better and i can look forward			0
at the moment the manager is using me as a box - to - box player and i am trying to score a goal			2
’ the @entity124 midfielder seems to be flourishing under the guidance of @entity3 boss @entity126 @entity0 believes an impressive @entity64 campaign with @entity63 has put him in good shape for the season he might be operating as a box - to - box midfielder but even after @entity126 opted for his third formation in 12 matches , @entity0 had to perform two jobs against @entity27			1
firstly in a more offensive role alongside @entity135 and then in a more defensive one alongside @entity137			0
asked to explain what he thinks @entity126 is trying to achieve , @entity0 said : ‘ it is about organisation and keeping the ball better			1
you have to close down when you lose the ball			0
it is a new philosophy			0
‘ when you bring in a new manager you have to wait because it is not easy to bring in a new philosophy but we are working hard in training			0
the manager has a lot of meetings to help us improve so we will see what happens in time			0
i am more comfortable here now			0
i know the players and the people who work in the club and that is important			0
