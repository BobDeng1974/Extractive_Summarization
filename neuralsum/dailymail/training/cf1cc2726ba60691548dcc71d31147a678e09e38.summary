there are more sex offenders living under supervision in the community in @entity4 and @entity5 than ever before ( file image ) another reason for the growing number of sex offenders is thought to be more people being caught downloading porn			1
coming a week after it was revealed that sex offenders were being released without undergoing any treatment to address their behaviour because of a shortage of places , the latest report showed that over the past five years , almost 400 sex offenders were charged with further serious offences			1
and despite surveillance by public protection agencies , 7,294 offenders breached their licence			0

' these allow us to keep closer watch on offenders and make our communities safer			0
sex offenders will also be forced to take lie detector tests			0
' any supervised offenders who give cause for concern can be recalled to prison immediately			0
' last week concerns were raised about the number of sex offenders being released into the community without their behaviour having been addressed while they were in prison			2
prison reports showed that despite the number of convicted sex offenders rising , the number of offenders being treated for the causes of their crimes had fallen			2
and the justice secretary @entity63 put back the deadline for privatising the probation service after he was told there would be public safety issues if he went ahead			2
he delayed the privatisation of 70 per cent of the probation service by two months to give the new ' community rehabilitation companies ' time to test their working methods before going live .			0
