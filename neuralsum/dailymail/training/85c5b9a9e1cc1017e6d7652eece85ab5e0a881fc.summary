by @entity0 , @entity1 published : 07:11 est , 17 may 2012 updated : 11:32 est , 17 may 2012 long summer holidays are cancelled for thousands of @entity4 workers – but they ’re still celebrating a famous victory and massive boost to the @entity8 economy that has left @entity10 rivals reeling			1
scrapping the ‘ traditional ’ long car industry factory summer shutdowns is a central part of a ‘ ground - breaking ’ new round - the - clock flexibility deal which has secured its future , @entity4 ’s @entity17 plant has been handed £ 125million investment to build the new @entity20 model from 2015 , with the creation of 700 direct jobs on top of the 2,100 already secured			1
driving forward : @entity26 bosses at @entity4 's @entity26 parent company @entity24 judged that @entity8 workers are more flexible , competitive and efficient - and less militant - than their counterparts in @entity10 there will also be 3,000 more indirect jobs with suppliers thanks to £ 1billion of parts business generated by the deal			1
the deal led @entity4 ’s giant @entity26 parent company @entity24 to choose it to build the next generation @entity20 ahead of a rival @entity10 factory judged less efficient , competitive , hard - working or flexible – and in a country struggling with a deepening @entity40 crisis			1
prime minister @entity41 hailed it as ‘ excellent news ’ for the factory and for @entity8 manufacturing on the same day it was announced that export - driven @entity8 car production , soared by nearly 10 per cent in april			1
business secretary @entity48 said it was ‘ fantastic news ’ while @entity4 bosses called it ‘ a historic day			2
’ one insider said : ‘ the @entity10 trade unions will go bonkers			2
’ under the ‘ unprecedented ‘ flexibility deal on pay and conditions agreed with a 94 per cent majority by the workforce , the plant will work 51 weeks a year , increase the number of shifts from two to three per day , and have a long - term four year pay agreement to ensure stability			2
there is also the option for saturday working and a 40 hour week when demand requires			0
the traditional summer shutdown in july and august will be scrapped to allow production to run through			0
but there will be a short shut - down between @entity70 and @entity71 , said @entity4			1
the four year pay deal also comprises a two year pay freeze from 2013 followed by two years of real terms increases of @entity76 inflation plus 1 per cent			0
the new workforce agreement comes into force in 2013 and runs through the life of the next generation @entity20 , into the early 2020s			0
production will soar from 140,000 now to 160,000 and up to a capacity of 225,000			0
@entity4 chairman @entity83 , who first worked at the @entity17 factory 20 years ago as a graduate , said it was a ‘ historic day ’ for @entity4			1
busy : production at the @entity17 factory is to soar from the current 140,000 cars a year to 225,000 of the flexibility deal he said : ’ it will do away with the somewhat old fashioned factory shut - downs which have been in place in the @entity8 workplace for centuries			1
’ mr @entity83 said : ‘ it really does put @entity96 at the forefront of manufacturing , not only in this country but across @entity100			0
’ @entity4 will also raise the amount of ‘ @entity8 - sourced components in the @entity20 to at least 25 per cent which will create further employment locally and in the @entity8 overall and further increase the plant 's competitiveness			1
@entity17 will be the lead plant to build the next generation five - door @entity20 hatchback plus one other variant – either the @entity110 estate or the sporty @entity111			2
that is to be decided			0
but it means a @entity10 factory at @entity115 – which was also bidding to build the next generation @entity20 – now faces the axe with the loss of more than 3,000 jobs			1
currently @entity10 workers at @entity115 produce just 30 cars a hour over three shifts			1
by contrast , @entity17 workers produce 47 cars an hour on just two shifts – and will boost that even more when they move tho round the clock working of three shifts			0
the deal turns on its head the notion that @entity8 plants are first in line for closure because their ‘ flexibility ’ means they are easier and cheaper to shut than in @entity10 where the cost of lay of are significantly more expensive			1
instead , the flexible agreements have proved a magnet for foreign investment			0
prime minister @entity41 said : ‘ this is excellent news for @entity17 and for @entity8 manufacturing			2
‘ once again we have seen the success of the @entity8 automotive industry and the crucial role it plays in growing and rebalancing our economy			0
’ he added : ‘ this has been a real team effort with the government , the company , unions and workers all focused on keeping production in the @entity8			1
‘ and the workforce at @entity17 should take great pride in their skill , hard work and commitment which has proved vital to ensuring this great result today			0
’ business secretary @entity48 said he was ‘ proud ’ to be at the factory for the announcement , describing it as a ‘ very great day ’			0
‘ the fact that big @entity26 car companies are making big investments in @entity8 is a good signal			1
’ mr @entity48 stressed how productive the @entity17 factory is when he held talks in @entity170 with bosses from @entity4 's parent firm @entity24 mr @entity48 said there were no major taxpayer subsidies but that @entity4 was free to apply for regional grants for training : ’ we ’ve not been waving a cheque book			1
’ he said that while the fate of the @entity40 might have played a part in @entity24 ’s decision , he did not believe it was the deciding factor			0
leading motor industry expert professor @entity183 said he was sounded out by @entity24 ’ @entity26 bosses about the relative efficiency of the @entity8 and @entity10 factories adding : ‘ they have looked rationally and forensically at the data			1
@entity4 ’s @entity17 factory has the second lowest unit costs for production anywhere in @entity100			1
the @entity10 have had a shock			0
’ prof @entity183 , director of the @entity194 at @entity196 @entity8 car production could hit a record 2.4million by 2015 , beating the previous record of 1.92million set in 1972			0
the official projection for this year is 1.55million			0
‘ the @entity8 motor industry is on a roll , he added			0
' some 80 per cent of @entity8 - built cars are now exported - the highest in @entity100			1
we ’re faring far better than the @entity204 and the euro - zone which is struggling			0
’ latest motor industry figures showed a near 10 % rise in the number of cars built in @entity8 compared to a year ago - boosted by strong export demand , new figures showed			2
there were 94,352 cars produced in april , an increase of 9.3 % on the same month in 2011 , and up by 11.8 % for the first four months of the year			0
the @entity215 ( @entity215 ) said the figures showed that the @entity8 remained one of the most competitive countries for car firms			2
almost half a million cars were built in the @entity8 in the first four months of the year , with more than 400,000 for export			2
the number of engines built increased by 1.2 % last month to 192,408 , while commercial vehicle production rose by 3.2 % to almost 9,000 , although it was 9 % down in the year to date			0
@entity224 , @entity215 chief executive , said : ‘ it is great news that @entity4 will retain its @entity17 plant and another important vote of confidence for the @entity8 automotive industry , adding to the wave of recent investment decisions that have backed our facilities and workforce			1
“ manufacturing is now core to our country ’s economy and the partnership forged between companies , employees , trades unions and government in the @entity8 automotive industry demonstrates that the country is a globally competitive place to do business			2

announcement ends months of nail - *biting* over future of @entity254 plant
@entity4 's @entity26 owners are to close factory in @entity10 with loss of thousands of jobs after backing @entity8 site
@entity8 workers found to be more flexible , competitive and efficient than @entity10 counterparts
