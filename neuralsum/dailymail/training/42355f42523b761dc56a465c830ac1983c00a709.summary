by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor they might be future rivals for the @entity4 leadership , but today @entity5 and @entity6 were at pains to show they are great mates			1
hitting the campaign trail for the the @entity10 by - election , the prime minister laughed , joked and even bought a rocky road cake for the @entity15 mayor			1
unfortunately the unusual joint appearance outside @entity15 drew parallels with the bizarre @entity19 photo opportunity in 2005 , when @entity20 bought @entity21 an ice - cream months before being forced to say when he would hand over the keys to @entity24			1
as they traded jokes at a bakery stall , mr @entity5 bought the @entity15 mayor a slice of cake , telling him ' that 's a gift			1
@entity64 ... you know you want it '			0
the pair spent about 30 minutes chatting with the public in the sunshine , posing for selfies and , in the case of mr @entity6 , handing out leaflets			2
they were trying to drum up support for @entity4 candidate @entity75 in the by - election triggered by the resignation of disgraced mp @entity78			1
@entity80 leader @entity79 ruled out standing in the seat himself , but mep @entity82 was selected instead			0
mr @entity5 bought mr @entity6 a Â£ 1 piece of @entity64 from @entity85 's bakery stall , which the mayor munched on as he teased the prime minister about his cooking skills			1
' the prime minister bakes his own bread , ' mr @entity6 said			0
mr @entity5 insisted on buying the crunchy treat , saying : ' @entity6 , that 's a gift			1
you know you want it			0
' mr @entity6 said : ' why do n't you share some of your baking secrets			0
' apparently both men agreed the @entity64 was excellent			0
during the 2005 general election campaign , with tensions between mr @entity20 and mr @entity21 mounting , spin doctors contrived for them to go on a walkabout in @entity103 , @entity104 to prove that they were actually getting on famously			2
but days after securing @entity19 's historic third election victory , mr @entity20 faced calls to quit early into his third term and was forced from office in 2007			0
mr @entity5 indulged in the political tradition of posing with babies while on the campaign trail securing victory in @entity10 will be key to the @entity4 plan to prove it can see off the threat from @entity80 during a walkabout , mr @entity5 was confronted about government policy on the @entity119 , crime and schools mr @entity5 insisted that the government was putting more money into key public services but as mr @entity5 munched on his own piece of chocolate and marshmallow he was forced to defend the 20 per cent vat rate by a more serious - minded member of the public who pressed him on whether it would be scrapped if he won the @entity132			1
' i can not make that promise , ' the prime minister said			0
earlier the duo were confronted about the state of local @entity119 services when he campaigned with @entity15 mayor @entity6 in a market ahead of the @entity10 by - election			1
mr @entity5 and mr @entity6 mingled with shoppers and market traders in the centre of the @entity145 town where the by - election is due on june 5			1
mr @entity5 and mr @entity6 are expected to be seen together a lot more in the run - up to the 2015 general election the pm has described the @entity15 mayor as one of his ' star players ' who he wants to see on the national pitch local resident @entity153 asked the prime minister : ' what have you done towards helping the hospital and everything closing in @entity10 ? ' mr @entity5 said : ' what we 're doing is that we 're keeping the hospital in @entity10			1
there 's a lot more we can do , particularly with the ambulance service , because i know the ambulance service has n't been good enough in recent years			0
' but mr @entity153 said : ' you 're running the hospital down , you 're running the ambulance service down , we 've got a police station with no policemen - this is only time we 've seen any policemen , today			0
you 've done nothing for @entity10			2
' the prime minister said : ' we are making sure that the hospital continues in @entity10			2
we 're putting money into the health service			0
' we 've got more doctors and more nurses here in the @entity181 than when i became prime minister			0
' but i know we want to do more on the ambulance service particularly , and that 's one of the things @entity75 ( @entity188 , the @entity4 candidate ) and i have been talking about today			2
