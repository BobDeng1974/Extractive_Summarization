@entity10 , nicknamed @entity11 , was born by cesarean section on may 9 at @entity13 in @entity14 , weighing in at 14 pounds and measuring 22 inches long			1
he is believed to be the heaviest baby born in the @entity16 this year ; only @entity17 of @entity18 , who weighed 13 pound 12 ounce , comes close			1
his mother , @entity21 , said she was stunned by how big @entity11 was when she delivered him at 38 - and - a - half weeks , as a previous ultrasound predicted he was going to be 11 pounds			2
big bundle : @entity10 , or ' @entity11 ' , was born in may weighing 14lbs exactly , shocking his mother @entity25 ( pictured ) who thought he was only going to be around 11lbs			1
he could be the biggest in the @entity16 this year the family is now wondering if their bundle of joy is indeed this year 's biggest			1
' we 've kind of been watching and waiting to see if there is a baby who is bigger , because he might be the biggest of the year , ' @entity10 told @entity34			0
but because of his size , he needed two doctors to help with the birth , rather than one , and required special maneuvering as he was ' so big and crammed in there ' , she told the @entity42			2
after he was born , he suffered respiratory problems and needed to spend a week in the @entity44			0
but he has since returned home and is in good health , his mother said			0
big brother : he 's so large he wears the same size diapers as his identical twin sisters , who are two cute : @entity51 's is in the 150th percentile for height and weight for his age but will slim down as he gets older at his last check - up , @entity11 's doctor said he was in the 150th percentile for height and weight for his age group - and he 's so big that he is wearing the same sized diapers of his twin sisters , aged 2			2
@entity34 reported that his size could be because of his mother 's type 1 diabetes or simply because of her family 's history of big babies and her husband 's height			1
but doctors said that as @entity11 grows and becomes a toddler he 'll slim down closer to average size			0
' this big bubba melts my heart , ' @entity10 said			0
' i love him more than i ever imagined i could love a sweet baby boy			0
he is my squishy cuddle bug			0

she added that the girls love to play with him - although they ca n't hold him on their own			0
while @entity11 could be the largest born in the @entity16 this year , @entity34 noted that the biggest newborn in the world is likely @entity89 from @entity90 , who was born in february weighing 15 pounds 7 ounces .			1
