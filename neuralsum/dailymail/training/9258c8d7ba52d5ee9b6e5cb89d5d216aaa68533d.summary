‘ the success of this effort comes from empowering people to be the solution , instead of expecting the government to do it , ’ pastor @entity14 said			1

' we 're hoping this fosters an outbreak of generosity , that people creatively invest the money in good works to make themselves and their community better ' pastor @entity14 parishioners appeared to take the ‘ do good deeds ’ message to heart			1

collection : the church wanted the idea to teach churchgoers that faith in @entity3 - not government - is the only route out of the current financial crisis ‘ the national economy might be in the ditch , but at the end of the day , your personal economy is what matters , ’ pastor @entity129 said			1
' they took a strong step of faith which shows people that church is n't all about the money , it 's about touching hearts ' churchgoer @entity75 ‘ the @entity101 teaches simplicity and living within your means , and that @entity3 gives us resources and trusts us to use them			1
