by @entity0 published : 15:59 est , 3 may 2013 updated : 10:13 est , 4 may 2013 who 's laughing now ? @entity2 has become one of the best - paid comedians on the planet to her fans she is the archetypal working - class heroine			1
coal - miner father ? check			1
cramped terrace home in a down - at - heel but close - knit community ? once upon a time			1
times are changing for stand - up comedian @entity2 and as she wakes up this morning in her gated mansion in @entity16 ’s stockbroker belt , she will not be worrying about the mortgage repayments			1
with five bedrooms , a library , conservatory and enough garage space for four cars , there is no shortage of space either			2
especially considering her only housemates are @entity27 , her fellow comedian and partner of seven years , and a pair of cats ( the younger of whom is named @entity33 after the heroine of the @entity36 movies )			1
@entity2 may still have the common touch on stage , but accounts revealed this week that the company through which she runs her affairs had nearly £ 2.5million in the bank this time last year — £ 2million more than in 2011			2
her luxurious home , nestled in the leafy fringes of @entity46 in @entity16 , cost her £ 1.3million when she bought it in 2012			2
this is a woman who in five years has gone from a virtual unknown to one of the best - paid comedians on the planet			1
more to the point , she has done so by staying true to herself and her working - class roots			1
only a few months ago , she was living in the rented flat in the heart of @entity57 she had called home for six years			2
it was on one of the busiest roads and not far from some of the toughest estates			2
her boyfriend lived 80 miles away in @entity65 — an endless source of gags for her stage routine			2
but the time had come to start living according to her means			1
and as she does so , her former husband @entity71 — the man whose walk - out devastated and inspired her — will be looking on with envy			1
where precisely that will be , no one knows , for he has disappeared since his former wife hit the big time			2
while @entity2 , 37 , has spoken at length about her divorce — indeed , her first stand - up routine was based on it — until now very little has been known about the man who propelled her to success by tearing her life apart			1
in interviews and on stage she has refused to identify him , while going into forensic detail in her act about the day he calmly informed her he did n’t love her and was leaving			2
this week , however , i spoke to @entity71 ’s sister at her semi-detached home in @entity95 , @entity96			1
@entity97 , 38 , who was a full - time carer for her mother until she died earlier this year , told me : ‘ @entity71 broke @entity2 ’s heart , but that ’s what my brother is like			1
everyone knows he ’s a bit of an a * * * hole			2
@entity2 , 37 , has spoken at length about her divorce - but very little is known about the man who propelled her to success by tearing her life apart ‘ we lost our mother a few months ago and i could n’t even get hold of him to tell him			1
he would always do that — he goes off for a couple of years at a time and comes back as if nothing has happened			2
the last time i saw him was at our dad ’s funeral ten years ago			2
‘ none of his friends know where he is now , no one in the family			2
i spoke to @entity2 recently to see if she knows where he is and she does n’t have a clue			2
she does n’t want to know			2
she prefers to cut all ties and i do n’t blame her			0
for all we know he might have changed his name			0
’ @entity2 has made no secret of the fact her divorce , which came out of the blue ten years ago , prompted her to take the plunge as a stand - up comedian			1
she had met @entity71 at the age of 21 when they worked in a cinema on the outskirts of @entity138			1
within a year they had caught a flight to @entity141 to get married			0
they settled into a workaday life , with @entity2 taking a job as a civil servant , while home was a series of cramped maisonettes			0
it was a humdrum , but — to @entity2 ’s mind at least — happy existence			0
that illusion was shattered overnight when @entity71 dumped her			1
at 29 , stripped of all optimism and self - belief , she moved back in with her parents			1
by her own account , she would spend hours lying face down on her sister ’s bed , sobbing			1
but on other days she felt strangely energised and started attending evening classes to develop her stagecraft			0
within a year she was performing stand - up in comedy clubs and became runner - up in the @entity165			1
while still playing small venues , she took great encouragement from the crowd reactions and spent the next three years honing her craft until she was ready to make her @entity171 debut			1
the show , @entity2 ’s @entity172 ( based on her divorce ) , took the @entity174			0
she has not looked back			0
since then she has become a regular on panel shows , played sell - out tours across the country , had her own @entity179 show , released two smash - hit live dvds and last year was given her own series on @entity182 , the @entity183			1
one critic described her as ‘ the most rapidly evolved national treasure in @entity187 light entertainment , basking in ubiquity ’			0
@entity2 has become a regular on panel shows and last year was given her own series that was two years ago and she has not slowed down since then			0
‘ the person you see on stage is totally her , ’ says @entity97			1
‘ all the little stories she tells about her dad , they ’re all just real life			0
it reminds me of when we used to have a glass of wine together , sit and tell family stories			0
that ’s just the way she tells them on stage			0
‘ her dad ’s the same			0
they do n’t mean to be especially funny — that ’s the way they are			0
they ’re a family of comedians			0
‘ i ’m so pleased @entity2 is moving in with her new lad			0
‘ some people have been surprised by how well she ’s done , but i ’m not			0
most comedians do the circuit for years and years before they ’re even heard of , but she ’s so amazing she just pinged into it straight away			0
’ all this success has brought material rewards , though such is the nature of showbusiness that it is only in the past couple of years that @entity2 has been pulling in bigger pay cheques			1
accounts for her company , @entity229 , show that in 2011 she had an income of £ 590,000			0
last year the company ’s earnings leapt by £ 2 million and continue to grow			0
nevertheless , with another successful dvd released since then , a record - breaking tour called @entity235 under her belt and another 130 dates lined up over the next year , those earnings are only going to go up			1
accounts for @entity2 's company , @entity229 show an income of £ 2.5million in 2012 her website is full of merchandising offers , including signed dvds at £ 15 each ( which , given the dvd normally costs £ 6 , means that her signature is valued at £ 9 )			1
small wonder she has moved into more salubrious surroundings , with her new neighbours including the solicitor @entity250 and @entity252 legend @entity251 , who plays @entity253			0
the houses are hidden away behind high walls , hedges and electronic gates , and are just a short distance from the picturesque 1,000 - acre @entity259			1
the nearest town is @entity261 , where the car salesrooms are @entity264 and @entity265 ( one of only three garages in the country to sell the super- expensive sports cars )			0
she has come a long way from @entity271 , yet it is telling that through it all she has kept her former husband ’s name ( she was born @entity275 )			1
her normality ( she professes to prefer ‘ watching telly ’ to reading books ) masks an extraordinary dedication to the job			0
she does not drink and drives 50,000 miles a year to performances			0
one of the main reasons she chose her new mansion was its proximity to the @entity288			0
@entity289 has also bred a degree of suspicion and she can be extremely guarded in interviews			0
while her act consists of cheerfully spilling intimate tales ( such as the occasion when she lost control of her bladder in a car and blamed it on a friend ’s dog ) , off - stage she goes to great lengths to keep her private life private			1
this penchant for mystery may well be the last thing she has in common with her former husband			2
he marked his 40th birthday last month without making any attempt to contact family or friends from home			0
but his sister feels confident he would be ‘ torn apart ’ by his former wife ’s success			1
‘ one thing i can tell you for sure is that he ’ll be absolutely raging about @entity2 because he was very money - orientated , ’ says @entity97			1
‘ that used to be the only time @entity321 and @entity322 would see him : if he wanted cash			0
‘ so i think the green - eyed monster will be there , which , to be honest , i think is quite good because after what he did he deserves it			1
‘ @entity2 knows that as well			0
she was devastated by what he did to her			0
but she now knows she ’s definitely got the better of the deal			0

@entity340 inspired her to start honing her stand - up skills
