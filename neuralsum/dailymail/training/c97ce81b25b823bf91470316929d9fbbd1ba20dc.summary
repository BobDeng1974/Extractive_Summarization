mr @entity2 said : ‘ making marriage available to everyone goes beyond individual relationships , proposals and weddings – it says something deeper too about the sort of country we are			2
‘ this is a country with proud traditions of tolerance , respect and equal worth			2
with this reform we are being true to those values			0
