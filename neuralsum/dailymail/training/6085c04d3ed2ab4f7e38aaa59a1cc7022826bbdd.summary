a self proclaimed ' politically incorrect conservative culture warrior ' has sparked outrage after he claimed that @entity3 is revisiting its gun laws in light of a 17 hour siege in a @entity8 cafe			1
@entity9 , while speaking to @entity11 host @entity10 on tuesday morning @entity8 time , called for the weapons ban in @entity3 to be lifted and that citizens should have the right to be armed			1
@entity9 claimed @entity3 had realised the ' bad guys ' should n't be the only ones with guns following the hostage situation at the @entity19 in @entity20 which saw two innocent people killed			1
@entity9 made unfounded claims about @entity3 reassessing gun control following the siege in @entity8 ' i think for the first time in a long time @entity3 realised what it is for the bad guys to have guns , but the good people not to and there was a sense of despair , a sense of helplessness yesterday , ' @entity9 said in a live cross to the program			1
' and i know that there are a number of @entity3 this morning having woken up after a long , long , long night thinking to themselves what could have been if someone did have a gun on them to stop this terrible awful ordeal that people had to tragically endure , ' he claimed			2
when asked whether the events had sparked a debate about whether @entity3 should reevaluate it 's gun control restrictions - which were introduced after the @entity50 in 1996 where 36 people were slaughtered in one of the deadliest shootings committed by a single person worldwide - @entity9 claimed that people were already discussing it			1
while on @entity58 also said the topic would be ' back on the agenda ' ' i certainly think it will be back on the agenda , i think now @entity3 are beginning to realise what it means to not have a gun in a time when a bad person does			2
' they realise that really it 's enabling the bad people to be able to carry out their agenda a lot more easily , a lot more freely than they may otherwise have			0
' he concluded by saying he ' can certainly see a change in sentiment ' and ' i think there will be a reevaluation '			0
in an opinion piece published by the same network , the @entity8 - born man continued to make unfounded and ignorant claims about @entity3 attitudes towards @entity81 and gun control			1
in an opinion piece published by @entity11 the @entity8 - born man continued to make unfounded claims about @entity3 attitudes towards @entity81 and gun control ' monday ’s distressing events have renewed @entity3 ’ concerns about @entity87 objectives , and a growing @entity81 presence in the country , ' @entity9 wrote			1
' interestingly , monday ’s events have also prompted @entity3 to revisit their gun laws , ' he claimed , before adding : ' it is unsurprising that home - grown terrorism is most rampant in nations with strict gun control			1
it is a reality that @entity3 ’s powerful anti-gun lobby seems to wish to ignore			0
' in a final comment @entity9 wrote that @entity99 with their liberal gun control laws and second amendment are ' the envy of a growing number of @entity3 that wish they were armed			1
' @entity9 also made waves earlier this year during another appearance on @entity11 touting claims that men ' @entity108 ' were losing their masculinity due to feminism			2
in a final comment @entity9 wrote that @entity99 with their liberal gun control laws and second amendment are ' the envy of a growing number of @entity3 that wish they were armed ' basically what feminism has delivered is angry women and feminine men and it emerges from this mindset that unfortunately a lot of women have bought in to this destructive idea that men prevent them from being able to achieve their goals			1
' @entity9 then when on to describe the ' phenomenon ' as ' dangerous ' and claimed ' it 's a very hard time to be a man in today 's society			2
' @entity9 is originally from @entity8 but has a fierce passion for @entity99 culture and conservatism			2
his website states he is : ' an inspirational author , international keynote speaker , and media commentator , he is considered an authority on @entity99 culture and the @entity136 - speaking world			0
' while holding office in @entity138 in @entity8 's inner - west in 2005 as the youngest deputy mayor in @entity3 , @entity9 attempted to ban pigeons from his electorate			1
@entity9 is originally from @entity8 but has a fierce passion for @entity99 culture and conservatism it was during the time the threat of bird flu was spreading across the world and he told @entity148 at the time he wanted to eradicate the birds in case they were carrying the disease			2
' @entity138 should be inhospitable to pigeons			0
avian influenza does not respect borders , ' @entity9 said			0
when asked how exactly he would implement such an exclusion zone around his municipality , he did not have a very effective solution			0
' i 'm not an expert			0
i 'm not an accountant			0
i 'm certainly not a pest controller			0
do n't ask me about procedure			0
what i would like to see is no pigeons in our area , ' he responded .			0
