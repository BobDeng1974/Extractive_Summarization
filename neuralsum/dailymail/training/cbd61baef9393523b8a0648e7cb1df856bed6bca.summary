by @entity0 @entity1 : the 16 - year - old died after taking @entity3 a common acne pill taken by thousands of young @entity6 women is under investigation following safety concerns			1
after it was recently linked to four deaths , regulators in @entity10 are suspending sales of the hormone treatment @entity3 , which is also used as an oral contraceptive and is known to increase the risk of blood clots			1
in @entity18 , 11 deaths have been linked to the drug			0
the @entity20 , which regulates medicines across @entity22 , announced last week it will now carry out a review into its safety			1
in the @entity6 , concerns about the drug were raised following the recent deaths of several young women , among them @entity1 in 2011			1
the 16 - year - old from @entity30 , @entity31 , had been prescribed @entity3 by her gp for acne and had been taking it for around four weeks before she died from an undiagnosed deep vein thrombosis , when a blood clot from her leg travelled to her lungs			1
dianette — or @entity3 as it ’s known in @entity10 — is prescribed to more than 62,000 @entity6 women a year , usually for polycystic ovary syndrome ( @entity44 ) , a hormonal problem affecting young women which leads to multiple small ovarian cysts , irregular periods , acne and excess facial hair			1
the condition is caused by an imbalance of the male sex hormone testosterone , which women also produce ( it ’s thought to help muscle strength and contribute to sex drive )			2
some one in ten women are affected			0
typically , it starts after puberty and can last for years			0
‘ being overweight increases the chance of getting @entity44 , but many women who develop it are fit and well , ’ says dr @entity60 , a consultant endocrinologist at the @entity61 , @entity62			0
in @entity1 's case , a locum @entity32 put the swelling and redness in her left thigh and ' knife - like ' pains down to an infection ‘ i tend to see 17 and 18 - year - old girls who have had problems for a couple of years , although it can affect women until their 30s			1
‘ it can be very depressing for them			0
some girls have so much facial hair as a result of the condition that they have to shave			0
' initially , we suggest losing weight or cosmetic treatments , but if they do n’t work , then @entity3 is often prescribed			2
’ @entity3 is a combination of two drugs — cyproterone ( a form of the female hormone progesterone ) and ethinylestradiol ( an oestrogen ) , which effectively suppress the effect of testosterone			1
as progesterone prevents ovulation , @entity3 also works as an effective contraceptive			1
@entity99 @entity60 while other oral contraceptives carry a small increased risk of blood clots — which can be dangerous and potentially fatal if they travel to the lungs or brain — the type of progesterone in @entity3 means the drug has one of the highest risks of blood clots of all oral contraceptives			1
@entity112 is 65 per cent more likely to cause a blood clot than @entity114 ( a type of progesterone found in older oral contraceptive pills ) , according to a review of 25 studies published last year in the @entity119			1
dr @entity60 explains : ‘ when you prescribe @entity3 , you explain to patients there is an increased risk of blood clots , although the risk remains low			2
' if you just wanted an oral contraceptive pill , you would go for a different drug which is slightly safer			1
‘ however , for women with @entity44 , @entity3 can really help			2
’ made by the @entity130 pharmaceutical company @entity129 , @entity3 has been available in the @entity6 since 1987 , but is only licensed as a treatment for severe acne and excess facial hair			1
it ’s normally taken for three or four months until the skin clears			0
a spokeswoman for @entity129 says : ‘ although @entity3 also acts as an oral contraceptive , it should not be used solely for contraception , but reserved for those women requiring treatment for the androgen - dependent conditions			1
’ dianette - or @entity3 as it 's known in @entity10 - is prescribed to more than 62,000 @entity6 women a year , usually for polycystic ovary syndrome ( @entity44 ) the @entity10 medicines agency last month revealed @entity3 is widely used as a contraceptive in @entity10			1
it is not clear what the situation is in the @entity6			2
the risk of a blood clot while taking @entity3 is , however , small			2
around 40 of every 100,000 women on it develop a blood clot in one year , compared with between five and ten women in 100,000 who are not taking the drug , according to the @entity161 ( @entity162 )			2
low - dose combined contraceptive pills carry the lowest risk of blood clots — approximately half the risk of @entity3			1
but the @entity3 risk is still lower than the risk of a blood clot during pregnancy ( about 60 cases for every 100,000 pregnant women )			2
professor @entity173 , a consultant gynaecologist at the @entity174 in @entity175 , says : ‘ for those with acne and symptoms of @entity44 , @entity3 is a very good medication and i have been prescribing it for 20 years			0
' generally , it is a safe drug and the chance of developing a blood clot is very small			0
’ the warning signs of a blood clot include pain , swelling and tenderness in the leg , and warm and red skin — but many patients and doctors are still unaware of the symptoms , according to @entity192 , the thrombosis charity			0
in @entity1 ’s case , a locum @entity32 put the swelling and redness in her left thigh and ‘ knife - like ’ pains down to an infection			0
she was prescribed antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs , but died 12 hours later			0
an inquest heard the @entity32 should have examined her calves , where swelling is a tell - tale sign of a blood clot			0
however , as blood clots are ‘ extremely rare ’ at her age , there was no family history and she ’d only been on the pill for a brief period , the @entity32 ’s actions were deemed ‘ reasonable ’			0
the @entity162 maintains the drug is safe			0
‘ despite recent developments in @entity10 , we have no new concerns and there is no need for a woman who is feeling well to stop taking her medicine			0
‘ if women have any concerns about their treatment , they should contact their doctor			0

@entity10 regulators have suspended sales of oral contraceptive hormone treatment @entity3
given to 62,000 women in @entity6 ever year , usually to treat polycystic ovarian syndrome , a hormonal problem
@entity20 - which regulates medicines - will now conduct safety review
