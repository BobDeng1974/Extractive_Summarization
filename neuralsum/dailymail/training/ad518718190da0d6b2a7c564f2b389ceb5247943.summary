first ever : @entity0 saw 11.02 of his @entity1 , a type of online currency , taken by the federal government in the first ever seizure of its kind a @entity9 man received a dubious honor in april when his @entity1 became the first ever seized by the @entity12 government			1
the @entity13 seized the 31 - year - old @entity0 ’ @entity1 , which are a type of online currency			1
it ’s believed that the seizure may have been related to shady online drug clearinghouse @entity17 , a site that only accepts @entity1 as currency			1
according to @entity13 documentation , agents seized 11.02 @entity1 from @entity0 , worth $ 814			1
though the forfeiture notice makes no mention of the online illicit drug seller , the @entity22 reports that speculation regarding the involvement of @entity17 has quickly arisen simply because of the @entity29 seizure			2
when buzz began to spread of the seizure , users of the blog @entity29 ! were able to connect the @entity29 account number listed on the @entity13 document to a transaction made in april on @entity17 of exactly 11.02 @entity1			1
‘ this is the first time something like this has happened with @entity29 , ’ said @entity37 , editor of @entity29 ! , told the @entity22			0
‘ and the interesting subtext is : we do n't have any idea just how involved the @entity13 is with @entity1			2
’ consequently , neither do @entity17 users know how deeply the so - called ‘ @entity47 of drugs ’ has been breached , if indeed it has at all , by the federal government			1
@entity47 of drugs : evidence suggests that @entity0 ' @entity1 were seized in connection with shadowy internet drug bazaar @entity17 , which only accepts @entity1 chomping at the bitcoin : bitcoins are a virtual currency that are difficult to track and the fact some were seized by the government led many who follow the novel money to wonder how they did it federal authorities admit to seizing @entity0 ’ @entity1 , however it is unclear how they went about actually holding onto the largely anonymous currency units			1
the @entity22 reports that the feds have not , however , charged @entity0 as of yet			2
the local authorities are going after him			0
the @entity65 , @entity9 police raided @entity0 apartment in june and , according to police affidavits , found 10 bags of the narcotic @entity70 during the search			2
how 'd they do that ? the digital currency is stored virtually by sites like @entity76			0
the feds may have used @entity0 ' own computer to seize his 11.02 @entity1 or staged an online sting operation he is also accused of selling other prescription drugs as well as marijuana to police informants			1
so how did the @entity13 confiscate completely digital currency ? according to @entity37 , the police would have either had to use the same computer @entity0 used to make the transaction to take ownership of the currency or they undertook an online sting operation in order to confiscate the coins			2
unstable currently : those in the know when it comes to @entity1 seem at a loss as to how @entity0 ' virtually currency was seized and what it means for the illicit sale of drugs and other items on sites like @entity17 in the future either way , this remains one for the record books and likely has @entity17 drug buyers squirming as their so - called @entity108 — a difficult to access layer of the internet invisible to the typical user where @entity17 can be found — may have been penetrated by authorities			1
they are no doubt chomping at the bitcoin as they wait to find out			0
the ' @entity117 ' dubbed by some as the ' @entity47 of drugs , ' @entity17 is an online , peer - to - peer marketplace for every drug imaginable			1
instead of money , however , @entity17 buyers and sellers use the hard to track digital currency @entity1			1
unlike normal websites , @entity17 can not be reached via normal routes			0
a special browser called a tor browser must be used to access the illicit site			0
sites like @entity17 exist in a sort of hidden internet , just beneath the one most people know and enjoy			1
it is known as the @entity108			0
commerce within the shadowy bazaar is tough to track and authorities have been unable to shut it down			0
however , the seizure of @entity0 ' bitcoins has some wondering if federal agents are getting closer to successfully infiltrating the site after years of unsuccessful attempts to bring it down			1
money in a digital age bitcoins are a type of online currency that can be exchanged for dollars and vice versa			0
the main idea behind it is to facilitate cheap , anonymous transactions policed by its community of users			0
much like gold , there are a finite number of @entity1 - 21 million exist and are predicted to last until 2140			2
this number was designated by the inventor ( or inventors ) of the virtual coinage when it first came about in 2008			0
also like gold , @entity1 are mined			0
but instead of digging in the ground , @entity1 are extracted online via complex algorithms like virtual pickaxes			0
the value of @entity1 fluctuate like gold , too			0

known as the ' ebay of drugs , ' the site is part of the so - called @entity108 , which is invisible to the typical internet *surfer*
@entity17 only accepts @entity1
@entity0 may have had connections to the site
