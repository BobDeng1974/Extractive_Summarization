most fathers are opposed to shared parental leave with many worried about the impact on their careers , research shows			1
a law introduced yesterday allows men to share up to 50 weeks of parental leave with their partner if their child is born after march 31 next year			1
instead of taking just two weeks of statutory paternity leave , fathers can take almost a year off to care for the baby			1
but a study suggests many have no intention of taking up the offer			2
this falls to one in five for over- 45s but rises to one in three for men under 25 , showing a generational gap in attitudes			0
under the new rules women must take the first two weeks , but men can then take over for the remaining 50 weeks			2
they can also take the time off at the same time			0
yet @entity25 found just one in ten men wanted to take the maximum amount of leave allowed , while almost half said they would still take two weeks			1
a separate report by law firm @entity41 found almost two - thirds of men and women were concerned that taking shared leave could damage their career prospects			1
half of men said they would be deterred from taking shared parental leave if male colleagues did not take it			1
deputy prime minister @entity51 , pictured , announced plans for shared parental leave in january 2011 @entity55 , of think tank the @entity53 , claimed that men ’s reluctance to take parental leave was mostly financial and not because they did not want to care for their child			1
he said : ‘ pay is the main factor			0
we know that for men to take advantage of these sort of things they need to be able to afford to do so			0
‘ is status anxiety an issue ? yes			0
you ’ve got to feel confident that if you do this it ’s not going to mess your career up			0
’ couples who take shared parental leave could also be offered less favourable packages than women on maternity leave			2
the law says firms must pay 90 per cent of an employee ’s weekly earnings for the first six weeks then £ 138.18 or 90 per cent of salary , whichever is lower , for another 33 weeks			2
in reality , many offer more generous maternity pay on top of this so that staff are not financially penalised for caring for their child			0
there is no obligation for employers to extend this enhanced pay to those on shared parental leave			1
however , @entity92 , a partner at law firm @entity93 , warned that employers could be sued for discrimination if they failed to offer the same generous package to men			2
yesterday , a report by the @entity100 said many pregnant workers are victimised by bosses with ‘ sacking , bullying and side - lining ’ commonplace			0
in the last five years , 9,000 women have brought tribunal claims against their employer for unfair dismissal or suffering a detriment because of pregnancy .			0

one in four @entity19 men said parental leave should not be shared equally
fathers had *previously* been allowed a two - week period of paternity leave
from today , fathers could in theory take almost one year away from work
however , *12* per cent of men said they would take the maximum available
the new *scheme* could cost employers up to £ *17* *million* in the first year
almost half of men surveyed said they were happy taking just two weeks
