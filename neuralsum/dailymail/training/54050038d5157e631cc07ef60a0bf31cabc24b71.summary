a $ 600,000 steel sculpture has been dismantled after it burned a hole through a man 's jacket by reflecting rays of the sun. the 16 - foot artwork , made up of two silver hemispheres , was billed as an ' interactive ' structure that could turn text messages into a light and sound display if visitors used their phones inside it			1
but the interaction went a touch further than expected when a man heard a sizzling sound - and watched as a hole appeared on his chest			2
a bit too interactive : this $ 600,000 steel sculpture reflected a ray of light onto a man 's jacket , burning a hole according to the @entity26 , the man stood inside the sculpture , as directed , and tried to text through the metal in order to create a light effect			1
within seconds , a sun ray bounced off the interior and refracted into a narrow beam of light aimed directly at the man - and it was powerful enough to singe his jacket			1
the visitor was uninjured , but the incident prompted city officials to place a blue fence around the sculpture to keep people from venturing inside			1
blasting city leaders , the center 's president @entity44 - a physics graduate - raged that the issue could have been solved by a first year science student			1
' you put a spherical surface out there in the sun â€” what did you expect ? ' she told the @entity26			2
' and what really gets me is they said , ' we had no idea			0
they should have had an idea			0
i mean , an elementary physics student , year one , could figure that out , find the focal point of that mirror			0
' anger : city officials have now been forced to dismantle the piece outside the @entity68 in @entity69 officials at the @entity71 for the @entity72 in @entity69 , @entity73 , have now conceded that the structure - a gift from @entity76 , @entity77 , in fall 2012 - has to be taken down			1
' it 's a beautiful , shiny object			0
and that , i think is part of the problem , ' @entity79 , the city 's art and culture manager , told the @entity26			2
the burning incident , which took place last summer , was the latest in a number of controversies surrounding the bespoke artwork , including disputes over the cost , scale and location of the piece			0
the issues have been a cause of outrage in the city , with authorities complaining the public never had a chance to appreciate it before protective fencing was put up			2
' here you have what 's supposed to be this impressive piece of art and i think it was fairly impressive and then you 've got this ugly construction fence around it , and it 's at the main entrance , in a place of honour , ' @entity103 president @entity44 said			0
they altered the angle of the structure , dulled the interior , and attempted to smooth certain parts of it using a hammer			0
however , a year of attempts has failed to resolve the issues			0
it will now be put in storage while they attempt to come up with a more permanent solution .			1

$ 600,000 16ft steel sphere was given to @entity69 , @entity73 , from @entity77

man entered the sphere , ray of light hit interior and sizzled his *clothes*
city leaders forced to put it in storage while they think of solution
