by @entity0 published : 04:35 est , 5 october 2012 updated : 04:39 est , 5 october 2012 while @entity3 's curiosity rover has excelled at sending back pictures of rocks on the @entity7 surface , @entity1 has not been left behind - as these stunning images of the @entity7 landscape show			1
on 8 june , the high - resolution stereo camera on @entity11 captured a region within the 1800 km - wide and 5 km - deep @entity14 basin , which was created by a gigantic impact in the planet ’s early history			1
it reveals the astonishing beauty of the red planet , with mountains frosted in carbon dioxide , and vast craters in an area researchers have dubbed the ' island of silver ' due to the frost topped peaks			2
the @entity14 and @entity30 on mars , with a frosting of carbon dioxide clearly visible in the top right of the image , taken from the @entity11 spacecraft			1
the area covered by the new images after @entity40 , the @entity14 impact basin is the second largest on the @entity7			1
the name stems from the @entity43 word ‘ argyros ’ ( silver ) and @entity14 was an ‘ island of silver ’ in @entity43 and @entity47 mythology			2
@entity50 , the famed @entity51 astronomer , gave the name to this bright region on @entity7 in his detailed 1877 map			1
at the centre of the larger impact basin is a flat region known as @entity58			0
the @entity11 images in this release all show a portion of the northern part of this area , with a large portion of each image dominated by the western half of the 138 km - wide @entity67 , named after the @entity69 physicist and astronomer @entity70			1
most of @entity58 has been shaped by wind , glacial and lacustrine ( lake - based ) processes , creating the smoother appearance of the landscape surrounding @entity67			0
inside @entity79 itself , researchers say prevailing wind activity has formed dunes and helped to create linear erosion , clearly seen in the images			2
the most striking feature of this image release , shown clearly in the first image at the top of the page , is the icing sugar - like covering of the surface to the south ( left ) of the image			0
this is frost , but made of carbon dioxide , not water			0
carbon dioxide ice is commonly seen on the surface of @entity7 , and has long been thought to form only at ground level , freezing out of the atmosphere as frost , which is most likely the case here			1
the lowlands to the south of @entity106 and regions within the crater are covered by a thin ice layer , the images show			2
however , it is lacking on the inner north - facing crater wall			0
@entity113 scientists believe it was probably melted there by the @entity116 , as indicated by the timing of the image			1
taken at around 4:30 in the local afternoon and during the southern hemisphere ’s mid-winter , the @entity116 would have been just over 20 degrees above the horizon			0
it should then have been able to melt ice on the steeper north - facing slopes , but would probably not have had enough time to warm and melt any on low - lying horizontal surfaces			0

the western half of the 138 km - wide @entity67 , with wind formed dunes at its heart , while to the left of the crater , the ice - covered plains of @entity58 are coated with a thin dusting of frozen carbon dioxide			0

*incredible* images captured by the @entity113 @entity11 craft
reveal the *majesty* of the @entity7 area first named in 1877 by @entity51 astronomer @entity50
