first @entity0 became the subject of a petition calling for him to be deported from the @entity3 for upsetting the gun lobby there			1
now a counter-petition has been started , asking for @entity3 to keep him – not because he ’s popular there but ( allegedly ) because no one here wants him back			0
the broadcaster is at the centre of a row after criticising pro-gun campaigners on his nightly @entity3 chat show in the wake of the @entity15 , in which 20 children and six adults were shot dead			2
more than 72,000 @entity3 have so far signed a petition on the @entity20 website calling for him to be kicked out			2
response : the @entity20 defended the freedom of speech and the press on wednesday in a long - awaited response to an online petition to deport @entity27 host @entity0 over his views on gun control but a second petition on the same website now insists he must stay in the @entity3 , not only because he has a constitutional right to free speech but also – ‘ more important ’ – because ‘ no one in the @entity34 wants him back ’			1
so far , just over 400 people have signed the ‘ keep @entity0 in the @entity3 ’ petition so it has some way to go before it reaches the 25,000 signatures which guarantees a response from the @entity3 government			1
it was proposed by @entity43 , a @entity44 - based website designer			0
to add to the former newspaper editor ’s embarrassment , a third petition is calling on home secretary @entity48 to stop him from returning to @entity34			1
appearing on the @entity3 website change.org it has so far attracted more than 100 signatures and states : ‘ we got rid of him once and why should we have to suffer again			2
the @entity3 wanted him so they should put up with him			0
’ this petition was written by ‘ @entity56 ’ , alias delivery driver @entity57 , who gave evidence to the @entity60 about how he tried to raise the alarm in 1999 about how mobile phones could be easily hacked			2
last week @entity0 repeatedly attacked pro-gun guests on his @entity27 show			0
more than 71,000 @entity3 have already signed an initial petition calling for the @entity34 journalists deportation after he criticised pro-gun campaigners on his chat show now a second petition on the @entity20 website now insists he must stay in the @entity3 , not only because he has a constitutional right to free speech but also ' more important ' because ' no one in the @entity34 wants him back ' in a heated exchange with @entity74 , of @entity75 , @entity0 called him an ‘ idiot ’ , ‘ dangerous ’ and an ‘ unbelievably stupid man ’ after he argued that more guns would actually cut crime			1
in another debate on gun controls , @entity0 shouted down economist @entity82 , author of @entity83 and branded him a liar for claiming gun crime trends in countries such as @entity34 supported his thesis			1
with @entity27 reportedly about to overhaul its prime time line - up and possibly move @entity0 to a later slot , the combative presenter has not commented on the row since christmas day , when he tweeted : ‘ @entity92 ! even to those who want me deported			0
’ he has stood by what he said , insisting that banning assault weapons and high - capacity gun magazines is no attack on the @entity98 but simple common sense			0
go home : how the @entity101 reported the story yesterday			0

a petition to have the journalist deported after he criticised pro gun campaigners has attracted 71,000 signatures
now a second petition saying he must stay because the @entity34 do not want him also has around 1,100 *votes* of support
