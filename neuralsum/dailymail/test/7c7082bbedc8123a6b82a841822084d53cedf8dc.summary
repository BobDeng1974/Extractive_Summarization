the end - of - season awards will go to the best attacker but if there was a defender of the @entity5 , @entity2 would clean up			1
nobody else would get close			2
this has been his best season in a @entity10 shirt			1
two seasons ago @entity11 said he could n’t cope with two games a week			2
that will have frightened the life out of @entity2			1
so credit @entity16 for trusting him and building that defence around him			1
@entity2 has never had pace but that is not a problem as he reads the game so well			1
he did n’t break sweat against @entity24 and @entity10 were too streetwise for @entity26 ’s team			1
@entity2 celebrates after the @entity28 match between @entity24 and @entity10 at @entity29 @entity10 are undefeated against the top four this season where @entity24 have lost twice — that is the gap @entity26 ’s side need to bridge and @entity2 has been a huge part of that			1
i remember playing against him early in his career and after i tackled @entity38 , he clattered right into me — he was n’t going to let me put one on his team - mate			1
that ’s when i knew he could grow up to be a special player			2
@entity2 celebrates with his team - mates after the @entity28 draw against @entity24 in north @entity45 one @entity46 of a result beating @entity48 was a massive result for @entity50			1
their run - in is horrendous and had they lost at @entity54 , surely it was all over			1
it shows how football fortunes can change in an instant			2
@entity46 are not the best away from home but as the stats below show , they thoroughly deserved their win			2
@entity63 was the star and could have had a hatful but i love the way he took his second			2
that little delay of his foot was just enough to put the defender off balance and give him a sight of goal before firing it in			2
@entity50 had to move quickly to sign him on deadline day in february but @entity63 has done well since joining from @entity78			2
if he carries on like this and @entity46 stay up they might have to build a statue outside the ground ! @entity83 celebrates scoring the opening goal during the @entity28 win against @entity48 can @entity86 still be the man ? after recent results , people say @entity89 is a dead man walking			2
beating @entity91 was important but can he keep his job under so much pressure ? deciding @entity89 ’s fate will be one of the toughest choices @entity98 ’s owners have faced			1
i spoke to @entity100 and he says they are fantastic people — there is no desire to chop and change			2
they have world class training facilities , an expanding stadium and absolute fortunes to spend			2
but this season has been a blip			2
@entity89 looks on during the @entity28 match against @entity91 at @entity112 @entity89 won two trophies last year , so they could keep him and let him rebuild			1
recruitment has been poor and they need to get it right in the summer			0
but it ’s no good letting him buy players only to get a new man in next year			1
if he is sacked , who gets the job ? @entity122 is the dream but it would take a major fallout for him to leave @entity126			0
@entity127 has the tools but no experience , @entity130 would be appointed on past success and @entity132 is an underdog manager			0
there is no shame losing to @entity137 , it ’s the defeats to the likes of @entity140 and @entity141 that have hurt @entity89			1
@entity98 could still get rid of him , but i ’m sure it would be with a heavy heart			1
@entity98 are dreaming of @entity122 but it 's unlikely the @entity126 boss will make the move to @entity98 flying foxes talk about timing your run			1
@entity151 are in amazing form			0
four straight wins is good for any side , let alone one facing a relegation battle			0
it ’s been a tough season for @entity158 with all the drama of him being ‘ sacked ’ and reinstated , but he has got his team flying at exactly the right time			0
home disadvantage ? there were only two home wins this weekend with three away and five draws			0
at this stage in the season sometimes it ’s far easier to play with freedom on the road than under huge pressure at home			1
@entity173 's poor show the way @entity175 are going i would not be surprised if they do n’t get a single point between now and the end of the season			1
they have been an embarrassment			0
it ’s as if they are in the clubhouse with 35 points			0
they do n’t look like adding to that any time soon and anybody with @entity175 in their run - in has got a chance of a result			1
a deflated @entity193 and @entity194 trudge off the pitch following yet another @entity175 defeat the @entity175 players react as they suffer yet another defeat , this time to @entity28 rivals @entity199 chaos at @entity201 , but it works @entity201 striker @entity202 celebrates scoring for @entity201 against @entity203 at the @entity204 @entity201 have spent 20 days at the top of the @entity207 table			0
@entity208 , who are on the verge of promotion , have led for 111 days			0
congratulations to @entity201 after their promotion , but if ever you want an example of how not to run a club , they have been it this season ! with unpredictable owners , four different managers and a host of key players on loan , it has been chaos			0
they have been outsiders throughout but have come through when it counts			0
i ’ve loved watching @entity202 and @entity227 bang in the goals and you ca n’t argue with the results			0
it just shows you there ’s no right or wrong in football			0
the @entity201 players celebrate victory against @entity203 as they all but secure their promotion to the big time @entity238 slip up two weeks ago @entity238 had all the answers but two defeats later it ’s back to the drawing board			0
it ’s not that they have been found out , but maybe they are not as good as people thought			0
they were just in good form			0
they have had the luxury of playing with no @entity252 football this season so still have work to do in the summer			0
it ’s the same feeling with @entity255			0
they started the season dreadfully but have won five out of six			1
i ’m a @entity259 fan and they have good players so we should not be surprised that things have changed			0
@entity264 watches on as his @entity238 side are comprehensively beaten by @entity255 paying the penalty why oh why did @entity267 not take that penalty for @entity140 ? yes , he is out of form and without a goal since february but what better way to get back on the scoresheet ? he took one against @entity91 in november and scored and he and @entity140 needed that goal			1
then to make things worse @entity151 go up the other end and score 27 seconds later			0
@entity140 midfielder @entity276 holds his head after missing the chance to score from the spot it was a similar story at @entity281			1
@entity283 ’s goals have kept his side going this season but he has missed two big penalties now — against @entity46 and @entity287			0
when every goal is so vital you ca n’t afford to pass up these chances			0
@entity291 if @entity281 go down , @entity292 wo n’t be the only player with plenty of suitors			1
@entity296 has been scoring and setting up good goals in the run - in			1
he is a useful @entity28 player			0
@entity283 looks on angrily following his penalty miss against @entity287 at @entity300			2

@entity2 has yet again impressed in the heart of @entity10 's defence
@entity16 should be given credit for trusting the *34* - year - old
@entity98 won , but is boss @entity308 still under pressure ?
*struggling* @entity281 and @entity140 could be left to *rue* their huge penalty misses
@entity16 : hazard is worth *£* 100m for each leg plus @entity315
