when @entity1 last ventured north to play in @entity2 , a bizarre diamond rush was unfolding in the @entity3 ; one which appears to have since fizzled out and come to nothing			1
as they make the same journey , 15 years on , @entity6 is polishing his formation and exploring options while hoping the sparkle he discovered in @entity12 proves to be more than a flash in the pan			1
@entity1 ’s midfield diamond caught the @entity12 by surprise in september but has enjoyed limited success since and was abandoned by @entity6 at half - time during saturday ’s 3 - 1 win against @entity20 at @entity21			1
@entity1 boss @entity6 may decide that time is running out for his players to impress in new system @entity6 introduced the diamond system to his @entity1 players in order to get the best out of @entity29 @entity29 claimed an assist in the second half after being moved out to the right - hand side of @entity1 's attack click here to read @entity36 's match report from @entity21 has it served its purpose ? after all , it was designed to get @entity40 and @entity29 into the team without dropping @entity42			1
but @entity40 was injured in training before that game in @entity45 and @entity29 is not in the same irresistible form			1
@entity47 came at @entity21 on saturday when @entity6 changed to a 4 - 3 - 3 with @entity29 on the right and @entity49 wide on the left — where the @entity52 man performed with more energy and commitment than @entity6 might have expected from @entity40 in the same position , and scored twice			1
it has been an awful couple of months for @entity40 and yet @entity6 ’s switch to the diamond in @entity12 came with a feeling that this had been decreed as the best way to @entity61 and beyond			1
it was the way to cram @entity1 ’s best players on to the pitch , and into key areas , which logic dictates offers the best chance of success when stronger teams come into competitive range , at a tournament			2
without another sea - change , the next 18 months is about refinement : helping players understand the complexities of the system and how to react when it fails , as it did in the first half against @entity20			1
‘ we ’re moving in the right direction , ’ said @entity6			1
‘ i do think we can get a lot better , but we ca n’t do more at the moment than keep working at our game and trying to win the games in front of us			1
we wo n’t be patting ourselves too much on the back			2
we know there ’s a long way to go before @entity90 2016			2
@entity40 has missed @entity1 's last four games due to the injury he sustained in training @entity94 had been deployed as a defensive midfielder in @entity1 's midfield ‘ we know there are a lot of stern tests ahead of us and it starts in @entity100			2
i hope the players who get a chance to play will a ) be able to stand up to any pressures and the crowd pressure and b ) learn from it			2
any lessons we take will only be valuable in the future			2
’ @entity2 will test @entity1 ’s character while challenging their strategy			2
can they develop this system against a confident and in - form team amid the frenzy of @entity113 ? when sir @entity115 was greeted warmly by a @entity3 football writer at @entity117 before this fixture in 1968 , he is said to have replied : ‘ welcome to @entity100 ? you must be f * * * * * * joking ! ’ the job , these days , demands a little more diplomacy			1
‘ i will change the team in @entity100 , ’ said @entity6			1
‘ but we are not looking to play a totally different team because we know that is going to be a tough game			2
a game like this in @entity100 will probably tell me a little bit more about this team			0
‘ we know what we ’re in for and we know the way we play and we ’re up for it			0
i am going to need some experienced players on the field			0
i ca n’t just make wholesale changes because we want to go up there and give a performance			0
’ the @entity1 boss wants to look at particular players in specific roles , including @entity142 within the diamond			1
@entity142 was among the substitutes at @entity21 on saturday but never likely to come on because he was troubled during the warm - up by a slight knee injury picked up in training last week			1
@entity6 wants to give @entity142 ( right ) a run out against @entity100 at @entity113 on tuesday @entity149 ( left ) or @entity150 ( centre ) will come replace the rested @entity152 ( right ) against @entity100 @entity153 goalkeeper @entity150 will feel at home if he wins his third @entity1 cap when they face the @entity156 at @entity113			1
@entity157 - born @entity150 , who is 26 , lost just 17 of his 140 @entity159 matches for @entity160 after joining them from @entity162 in 2010 , initially on loan			1
since transferring to the @entity153 in august for £ 10million , he has conceded only five @entity165 goals , helping them become this season ’s surprise package			0
‘ i do believe he ’ll be available against @entity100 , ’ said @entity6			1
‘ that ’s good news because i ’d like to see him in an @entity1 shirt at some stage during the game			0
’ @entity175 had been earmarked for the game in @entity2 until he pulled out injured			0
@entity177 and @entity178 are others who might be tested again , and @entity180 is in contention for a first cap , possibly from the bench			0
having sent @entity152 home for a break , there will be a rare chance in goal for @entity149 or @entity150 , who will be returning to @entity113 for the first time since his £ 10million transfer to @entity153 in august			0
in four years as @entity160 keeper , @entity150 broke the club record for successive clean sheets and the @entity195 record for time without conceding a goal , and won three @entity199 titles and two @entity3 cups			0
‘ i will be forever grateful for what @entity160 did for me , ’ said @entity150			0
‘ they really believed in me			0
@entity203 , the goalkeeping coach , put in a lot of time and effort and really brought me on			0
‘ it will be good to go back			0
i know a few of the lads in their team			0
to play in a @entity100 - @entity1 game would be a dream come true			2
it ’s an unbelievable atmosphere			0
the @entity215 players said it was the best they ’d ever played in			0
that tells you how unique it is			0

@entity6 decided to change to a 4 - 3 - 3 formation during second half of 3 - 1 win against @entity20
diamond formation was supposed to get the best out of @entity29
however @entity29 impressed when he was moved out to right flank
