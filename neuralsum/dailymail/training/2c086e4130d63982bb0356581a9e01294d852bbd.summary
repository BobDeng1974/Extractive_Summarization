from water - fuelled cars to shape - shifting tricycles , finding ways to cut emissions has led to some bizarre vehicle designs over the years			0
now @entity5 has unveiled what it claims to be the ultimate in ‘ green driving ’ - a concept car that doubles up as a huge solar panel to generate energy			1
using something known as ‘ multi-voltaic ’ silver paint , the @entity14 manufacturer ’s @entity12 is designed to capture energy from solar rays to power a hybrid engine			1
the suv concept car - or @entity34 ( @entity35 ) as @entity5 calls it - was unveiled this week at the company ’s new research base in @entity38			1
as part of its set up , the back wheels are powered by an electric motor while the front wheels are driven by a hydrogen combustion engine			0
@entity5 envisages operating the motor and engine either individually or together , depending on road conditions			0
using something known as ‘ multi-voltaic ’ silver paint , the @entity14 manufacturer ’s @entity12 is designed to capture energy from solar rays to power a hybrid engine the four - door vehicle is roughly the same size as a @entity55 , at 13.5ft ( 4.1 metres ) long			1
@entity5 has yet to offer other specifics on speed and power			0
instead of b - pillars , the vehicle ’s doors are hinged front and back allowing easier access to the rear - seat			2
the car also features a light display at the front of the car - a reference to @entity71 ’s glowing warp drive			1
the light glows blue when the car is parked , purple during normal hybrid driving and red in sport mode			2
the car ( interior pictured ) can generate power using electrostatic charge from the bodywork slicing through wind , as well as kinetic energy from the suspension instead of b - pillars , the vehicle ’s doors are hinged front and back allowing easier access to the rear - seat the car also features a light display at the front of the car - a reference to @entity71 ’s glowing warp drive ( pictured ) in @entity96 just as striking is the continuous glass panel which stretches from the driver 's side window around the windshield to the passenger side			1
the interior also features anti-dirt fabrics and 3d body scanners that keep an eye on biometrics of each passenger , automatically switching on the massage - mode if the car decides passengers are getting tired			1
@entity112 has opened a research and development ( r&d ) centre in @entity38 tasked with further tuning its @entity5 brand to wealthy @entity118 tastes			2
the @entity14 car maker is expanding its @entity5 brand in @entity118 at a time when an investigation into anti-competitive practices in the auto industry is prompting car makers to lower prices			0
the company said it plans to raise the number of @entity5 engineers and other specialists in @entity38 to 500 by the end of next year from 350			2
its focus on @entity118 tastes should help @entity5 catch up in the local luxury car segment with @entity138 's @entity137 and @entity139 , he said			2
researcher @entity140 projects @entity5 to sell 291,000 vehicles in @entity118 this year , compared with 581,000 for luxury market - leader @entity137 and 448,000 for second - placed @entity139			0
meanwhile , oxygen produced by the hydrogen drivetrain is pumped into the cabin to improve air quality			0
it even features electric scooters hidden under the trunk floor to complete journeys without having to go on foot			0
while this is a concept car , the hope is that a number of the ideas featured in the design could someday make their way onto @entity5 ’ models in the future			0
