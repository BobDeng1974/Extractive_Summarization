@entity0 are in familiar territory facing an @entity3 replay against one of the country 's best , only this time it 's @entity6 and not @entity7			1
last season , the @entity9 side held eventual @entity11 champions @entity7 to a draw , but were then thrashed 5 - 0 in the return			2
none - the-less , midfielder @entity14 did n't come away from the game empty handed and grabbed @entity17 's shirt at the end , which takes pride of place framed in his living room			1
' i do n't know what he did with mine , i think he needed something to clean his car with ! ' @entity14 jokes , hoping that there will not be a repeat when they host @entity6 on wednesday in their @entity3 quarter - final replay			1
' when we went to @entity32 in the last match we were scared of failing and scared of getting hammered			1
that 's part of what makes you dig even deeper against those sides			0
' @entity41 's contract negotiations have dominated the headlines in the past fortnight @entity14 , who will face @entity41 on wednesday night , has sympathy for the young winger @entity0 manager @entity45 and his players are also hoping the @entity6 players ' studs will sink a little further into the @entity50 turf , currently in a sorry state , to help their cause			1
' @entity53 in our last game there you had to take three touches to control the ball , ' @entity14 explains			1
' personally , it 's not what i like , but if it takes @entity64 a few extra seconds to control the ball then i will be happy with that			0
' it does not suit @entity14 , 24 , who is a ball - playing central midfielder with a sweet left foot			1
but he is also not afraid to get stuck in , learned when he had a taste of the top flight as a teenager at @entity74 when @entity75 threw him in as the club were heading down			0
since then , after moving to @entity0 , on loan first and permanently last summer , he would kill for a chance to get back there			1
one might expect him , then , to be incredulous that @entity6 's @entity41 is turning down contracts worth £ 100,000 - per - week but @entity14 feels sympathy instead			1
' i know it sounds stupid more than one hundred grand a week but that 's the world we live in and that 's football , ' he says			2
' it 's up to him			0
if he stays at @entity6 he will be one of the top players for the next eight years			1
' he might be thinking the top dog at @entity6 is on a lot more and he feels he 's doing a job just as well			2
to turn down one hundred grand a week in our world is crazy but he 's in the top three 20 - year - olds in the world			2
' @entity41 shares a laugh in training ahead of @entity6 's @entity3 replay with @entity0 on wednesday @entity41 has been linked with a move to @entity100 , admitting he was ' flattered ' by their interest part of @entity41 's issue is that boss @entity105 sometimes plays him as a wing - back instead of up front , where the player prefers			1
' i was pleased when he played wing - back against us in the first match , ' @entity14 adds			1
' he was out of the way a little bit			0
' @entity14 has his own taste of superstardom , too , if only around @entity0 's @entity117 where he goes by the nickname of ' @entity119			1
' when he first joined the club , the other players dug up pictures that revealed his uncanny resemblance to the @entity125 pop star			0
' it was on my old @entity127			0
i had a basketball vest on and shades and a cap backwards , ' @entity14 says			2
' i did n't have any stubble because i ca n't grow it so they thought i looked a bit like @entity119			0
' he 's not bad with the ladies is he ? and i like a few of his songs so it could have been worse			0
' @entity14 and @entity41 — and @entity119 , come to that - — were not born the last time , before this season , @entity0 met @entity6 in an @entity3 quarter - final			1
that was in 1958 when @entity143 and @entity144 scored late on for @entity0 to overturn @entity146 's early @entity6 goal			1
yet @entity14 's upbringing was rich in the competition due to his father @entity149			2
' he used to go on about the @entity3 all the time when i was little , ' @entity14 says			1
@entity0 were hammered by @entity152 ( centre ) and @entity154 in a @entity3 replay last season ' some people do n't see it as big as they used to in the olden days			1
but the @entity3 is one of the most famous competitions in world football			2
to play in a semi-final at @entity162 would be a dream			0
' he 'd go on about @entity165 beating @entity166 2 - 1 in 1972 , those types of games			2
i 'd say right , dad , bore me later , but he is right			0
the underdog playing the favourites , anything can happen			0
we 've shown that this season			0
' he ca n't believe i 'm playing in an @entity3 quarter - final			1
he used to play four or five rounds before the @entity181 and think it was good			0
' if you spoke to him you 'd think he was @entity185			0
to be fair , he has a good touch			0
he played for non-league around @entity188			0
' he sometimes tells me things and i 'm like dad , shut up , you were playing against drunken keepers on sunday mornings			0
' a @entity162 day out against @entity194 welcomes the winner			0
if @entity198 make it , his father will have another @entity3 upset to go on about .			2

@entity0 face @entity6 in the @entity3 quarter - final replay on wednesday
@entity14 has sympathy for @entity41 over his contract
@entity41 *rejected* a £ 100,000 - a - week new deal at @entity32
