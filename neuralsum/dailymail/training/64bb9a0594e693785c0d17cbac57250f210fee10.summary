by @entity0 a 17 - year - old @entity2 photographer spends less time snapping selfies and more time taking breath - taking and often illegal views of @entity7			1
@entity8 , 17 , spoke with @entity9 about the growing popularity of urban exploration , the incriminating drive to take the perfect photograph of @entity7 , and about receiving death threats for speaking with the media			1
@entity8 and other @entity2 outlaws , namely one named @entity16 , compete against one another for followers and frighteningly gritty urban snapshots			1
@entity9 explains that both @entity37 and last suspect are part of a group of @entity2 users called a ' k ' or someone with over 10,000 followers so that the last letter of the number of followers is replaced with a @entity46 not only do they shoot alike , they dress alike and can be seen wearing photographer 's backpack 's and @entity50 shoes so that they can climb the tallest building or even scale the top of a bridge			1
two other well - known @entity2 outlaws go by the name of demidism and @entity58 and their work reflects the same adventurous qualities			1
@entity9 says urban exploration is no new trend			0
adventure seekers have long been trespassing onto @entity7 's most coveted landscapes			0
instead of merely observing the structures , however , modern urban exploration has taken the social media trend with it and is becoming more and more about taking the perfect photograph than secretly enjoying city views			0
@entity71 are more like graffiti artists than they are the urban explorers of a decade ago			0
instead of thriving on just an experience , they photograph the structures and leave their mark by posting a photo on @entity2 -- or leaving a little something to remember them by			1
@entity37 ' name blew up on july 22 after a mysterious someone changed @entity82 flags on the @entity83 to big white flags			0
@entity85 : urban explorers like @entity16 take to the streets to capture gritty shots every corner : @entity2 outlaws like @entity91 capture photos from every creeping corner top photographers : instagram outlaws have risen to skyscraper heights of social media fame make it shine like the top of the @entity99 ! : photographers like demisdism take beautiful and frightening images at the same time @entity37 , who is known for scaling bridges , did n't change the flags but woke up to thousands of messages from fans asking him if it was him			1
in reality two @entity110 artists @entity111 and @entity112 changed the flags and admitted it to the @entity115 this week			0
@entity8 publicly said that he did n’t change the flags but the stunt got @entity8 an interview nonetheless			2
@entity37 ' friend @entity118 cuts the hair of a @entity121 reporter who wanted to do an interview with an @entity2 bridge - climber			2
@entity8 told the reporter the best time to scale bridges is at night and he mentioned his @entity2 rival last suspect who he said jokingly took credit for the flag prank			1
he then shared a snap of @entity16 with the words ' you should n't take credit for someone else 's work			0
' last suspect asked his followers to later boycott deas and @entity8 received death threats			1
tunnel vision : @entity8 is focused on photographing @entity7 's most fascinating structures while flirting with danger camera flash : @entity8 snaps his camera and then he 's gone to explore some other urban terrain electrifying : @entity8 ' work shows the power and grit of @entity7 paired with uncontrollable nature city lights : not only is the bridge better to climb at night so as not to get caught , it 's also just plain beautiful people accused @entity8 of trying to sneak his way to the top of @entity2 fame by exposing coveted secrets			1
believe it or not , @entity8 did n't start scaling buildings until earlier this year after seeing a video of @entity161 daredevils climbing a 2,073 - foot @entity162			1
' i was like , damn , this is so dangerous , ' he said of seeing the video for the first time			0
@entity9 explains how it was so dangerous he wanted to try it out on his own			0
' i ’m thinking , hey , they ’re in @entity170 , they ’re not in @entity7 ... i can show @entity7 this kind of photography			0
' in april , @entity8 made the decision to climb the @entity83 side of the @entity176			2
it only took him 15 minutes			0
he went on to climb the @entity178 , @entity179 , and the @entity180 , and the @entity176 another six times			0
do n't fall ! : @entity8 risks his life almost every time he takes a photograph @entity184 : @entity8 has received death threats for speaking out about his work in the past and now he keeps a low profile bridge over troubled water : even though @entity8 has made some rivals while taking photographs he still manages to take spectacular shots he later advanced to climbing @entity7 's tallest skyscrapers			1
though @entity8 walks the narrow bridge between legal and illegal , he seldom gets caught and has a plan for when he does			2
@entity8 once got caught photographing a girl from the 53 - floor @entity198 on @entity199			2
when cops arrived , @entity8 told them he had a @entity202 exam the next day and so the police let him off with a warning			2
' i knew he would n't arrest me because i had a test in the morning , ' @entity8 quipped			1
' he 's a dad			0
' @entity9 reports that @entity8 has been trying tom keep a low profile following the white flag incident			2
as he and a reporter passed the @entity180 he said , ' if i really wanted to , i could do it , ' ' the @entity212 is not superhuman			0
' he suspects it 's time to take a photograph : last suspect shows off his chops by photographing this storm crossing the line : hen it comes to climbing bridges , no height is too tall for brave photographers like demisdism urban secrets : like the urban explorers of the past , @entity225 likes to discover the unknown his home : @entity8 grew up in @entity7 and his images are an homage to his city 's unique architecture			1
