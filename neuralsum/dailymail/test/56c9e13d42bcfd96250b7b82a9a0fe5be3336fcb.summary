speaking after the robbery attempt , the great - grandmothers said they refused to let the ' weasel ' bring them down			1
mrs @entity1 said she had seen the young man 's intention to take the contents of mrs @entity9 's basket , before turning on her in an attempt to steal a brand new pair of trousers from her bag			1
the sprightly 92 - year - old says the next few moments were ' a bit of a blur ' and that all she remembers is accelerating her scooter and knocking the man to the ground			1
mrs @entity1 , who has four children , ten grandchildren and 13 great - grandchildren , said : ' i saw him look into my basket and i said ; ' oh no you do n't ! ' , really loudly			1
' i put my scooter into accelerate and turned really fast			1
the next thing i know he was on the floor			2
i thought ' my gosh '			2
' i had slowed up because it looked like something was going to happen			2
he just looked evil , with dark , piercing eyes			2
' he came from over my shoulder , caught my arm and pulled me back			2
' when he came round the second time , i slammed down on the speed so the scooter went up on to the grass , and when the back end came round it knocked him down			1
' he lay there for a moment and then made a quick exit			2
i have never seen him round here before , and i felt a bit panicky because we did not like the look of him			0
heroic ladies : mrs @entity1 and her friend @entity9 , 75 , had been to a lunch club meeting in @entity11 , @entity12 , when an ' evil looking ' man tried to rob them of the contents of their mobility scooter baskets ' you just do n't think this would happen to you on your way home from lunch club			1
' we always go together , and it 's a good thing we did , otherwise it would have been much easier for him			0
' i might be old but i 'm still quick			0
i think the way i shouted probably frightened him			0

we were lucky , because he could have hit us - if he had been able to catch us			2
' mrs @entity9 , a mother - of - three , who has eight grandchildren and four great - grandchildren , added : ' we came around the corner and he was just stood there by the fence			1

' i heard @entity1 shout so i swung around and all i saw was him on the floor			1
i did n't see his face after that because he ran away so fast			0
' if he had got my bag he would have got everything , because all my bank cards were in my purse			0
we were both very shaken up by it , but we can laugh about it now			0
