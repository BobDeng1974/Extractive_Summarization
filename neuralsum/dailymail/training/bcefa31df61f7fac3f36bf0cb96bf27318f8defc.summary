by @entity0 published : 07:25 est , 22 november 2013 @entity2 : 07:59 est , 22 november 2013 a newly discovered dinosaur that lived 100 million years ago has been unearthed by palaeontologists			1
experts believe it is one of the largest species of meat - eating dinosaur that ever lived in @entity9 and was the top predator before the @entity11			1
the dinosaur , @entity13 , has been named after a cannibalistic monster of @entity16 legend , called @entity13 , which closely resembled a @entity11			1
@entity13 , has been named after a cannibalistic monster of @entity16 legend , called @entity13 , which was based on a @entity11 the ‘ man eating monster , ’ which is described in the latest issue of @entity21 , is thought to have measured up to 40 feet long and weighed around seven tonnes			1
palaeontologists think that it was only when @entity13 became extinct that @entity11 was able to become the apex predator			2
the fossilised remains of the newly discovered species were found near @entity27 in the @entity28			1
the dinosaur discovered was a juvenile when it died , but is thought to have measured 30 feet long and weighed 9,000 pounds			2
@entity32 dr @entity31 , of @entity33 , said : ‘ this dinosaur was a colossal predator second only to the great @entity11 and perhaps @entity36 in the @entity9 fossil record			0
‘ it has been 63 years since a predator of this size has been named from @entity9			0
you can not imagine how thrilled we were to see the bones of this behemoth poking out of the hillside			0
’ an illustration of a @entity13 within its ecosystem , eating an @entity48 and intimidating small - bodied tyrannosauroids			0
a new species of carnivorous dinosaur , which is one of the three largest ever discovered in @entity9 , lived alongside and competed with small - bodied tyrannosaurs 98 million years ago @entity13 is one of the three largest dinosaurs ever discovered in the @entity56 and a species of massive meat eaters called carcharodontosaurs which include the @entity60			1
the only other giant from @entity9 is @entity62 , which stalked the eastern side of the country more than 10 million years earlier			0
dr @entity31 discovered part of the skeleton of the new species with dr @entity69 of @entity71 's @entity70 during a 2008 expedition to an area known as @entity74 - a famous dinosaur graveyard			2
it is now clear @entity13 ' large size would have prevented smaller tyrannosaurs from taking their place at the top of the food chain			1
dr @entity69 said : ‘ the huge size difference certainly suggests tyrannosaurs were held in check by carcharodontosaurs and only evolved into enormous apex predators after the carcharodontosaurs			0
' dr @entity31 said : ‘ contemporary tyrannosaurs would have been no more than a nuisance to @entity13 , like jackals at a lion kill			2
it was not until carcharodontosaurs bowed out the stage could be set for the evolution of @entity11			0
’ @entity11 evolved 30 million years later and weighed around twice as much as @entity13 the newly discovered species would have terrorised what is now @entity99 during the period known geologically as the @entity101 between 100 million years and 66 million years ago and was previously unknown who the top meat eater was in @entity9 at the time			1
dr @entity31 said : ‘ @entity105 reigned for much longer in @entity9 than we expected			0
’ the newly discovered species fills a gap of more than 30 million years in the fossil record when the top predator role changed hands from carcharodontosaurs in the @entity112 to tyrannosaurs in the @entity114			1
the lack of fossils left palaeontologists unsure about when this change happened and if tyrannosaurs outcompeted carcharodontosaurs , or were simply able to assume apex predator roles following carcharodontosaur extinction			2
at the time , @entity13 dominated the landscape , which would have been populated by plant eating dinosaurs , turtles , crocodiles and giant lungfish and other predators such as early tyrannosaurs and several species of feathered dinosaurs that have yet to be described by the team			1
dr @entity69 said : ‘ we have made more exciting discoveries including two new species of dinosaur			0
there are a lot more cool critters where @entity13 came from			0

palaeontologists discovered the fossils near @entity27 in @entity99
the ' new ' species of dinosaur , @entity13 , has been named after a cannibalistic monster of @entity16 legend
experts believe @entity13 ' large size would have prevented smaller tyrannosaurs from taking their place at the top of the food chain
