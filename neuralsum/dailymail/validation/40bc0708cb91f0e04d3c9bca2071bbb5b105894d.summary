@entity0 had long since been knocked out of the @entity1 by the time the decision was taken to sack @entity3 in the spring of 2013			1
@entity5 football was not the @entity7 ’s speciality			0
however , as @entity12 looks for a result to save his team ’s season , other similarities between the reign of @entity0 ’s current coach and the final , faltering weeks of his predecessor ’s are strikingly relevant			1
certainly the two men are different			0
@entity12 is placid , @entity3 explosive			1
@entity12 is considered by some at @entity0 to be rather too nice while @entity3 made enemies at every level			1
but , although @entity12 may beg to differ , the warnings for the @entity21 are to be found using football ’s most fundamental barometer : results			1
@entity12 is fighting to save his @entity0 job and needs a good result in @entity27 @entity0 are looking to overturn a 2 - 1 first - leg deficit in the @entity29 @entity3 ’s final year at @entity0 saw a @entity31 title win , a summer of faltering efforts in the transfer market and a subsequent championship defence in which his team ’s levels dropped to the extent that they ended the 2012 - 13 season some way short of a rival — @entity41 — who did not have to be imperious to beat them into second			1
sound familiar ? two years on and again @entity0 have failed to build on success			2
they have bought modestly , played well only sporadically and look destined to trail another less - than - convincing rival — this time it ’s @entity48 — by some distance by the time they reach the finishing post			0
did @entity41 win the title two years ago or did @entity0 simply fail to defend it properly ? perhaps a bit of both			2
can we say the same again this time round ? almost certainly			0
talk to people at @entity0 and they will stress that @entity3 was not sacked because he failed to win a second league title			2
he was dismissed because @entity0 had failed to move forwards in @entity60 and because his style of management was , they feared , about to rip holes in the fabric of the club			2
nevertheless , the similarities between what should have been @entity3 ’s consolidation season and this one are clear and that is why @entity12 has every reason to feel anxious ahead of a mammoth task at the @entity29			1
on tuesday at @entity0 ’s hotel by the port , @entity12 was in denial mode once again			1
‘ i do n’t think my seat is in danger , ’ he said			0
@entity0 's @entity31 title challenge suffered a further blow with defeat at @entity80 @entity12 finds himself in a similar position to @entity3 before the @entity7 was sacked @entity3 left @entity0 after a failed @entity31 title defence and another dismal season in @entity60 nevertheless , in the first leg of this tie at the @entity87 three weeks ago we saw far too much of what is wrong with the modern @entity0 and not enough of what is right			1
haphazard at the back , weak in midfield and mentally suspect by their own admission , @entity12 ’s team were overrun for 45 minutes			1
only their own spirit , the excellence of @entity96 and a rare moment of fallibility from @entity99 at the death kept @entity0 in touch			2
as such , if they are to overcome a 2 - 1 deficit they simply must show us something we have not yet seen from them at this level , under either manager			1
those who point to wins at home against @entity110 and away at @entity111 as evidence that @entity0 are learning are clutching desperately at straws			2
@entity114 does n't fear for @entity0 job @entity116 and @entity12 speak from their hotel in @entity27 on the eve of the second leg @entity116 knows his team must improve if they are to stand any chance of progressing to the quarter - finals @entity125 's penalty save from @entity99 at the end of the first leg has given @entity0 a glimmer of hope @entity0 were on the ropes for much of both games			1
certainly they controlled neither and were aided by some good fortune			0
on wednesday it must be different , something the returning @entity116 seemed to agree with when he spoke on tuesday			2
‘ last year everybody said we were a top team in @entity60 , ’ said the @entity136			0
‘ now we have lost a couple of games and everybody says we are the worst			0
we can deal with that			0
the players know what they have to do			0
’ during their own media gathering earlier in the day , @entity27 coach @entity144 and midfielder @entity145 spoke diplomatically			2
city remain a feared opponent , was the message			0
the truth , however , is that @entity0 have not remotely troubled the @entity156 club in successive @entity1 meetings , and given that @entity27 have won 16 of their last 17 games and are yet to be shut out in @entity60 this season , the size of the @entity153 club ’s task is clear			1
@entity27 train at their @entity162 base on the eve of the second leg against @entity0 @entity165 scored both @entity27 goals in the first leg at the @entity87 there was one item of good news for @entity0 on tuesday when @entity144 confirmed that his central midfield totem , @entity172 , will not play			1
the great @entity173 is injured and that may offer the likes of @entity116 and @entity176 some hope as they look to attack @entity27 ’s back four			1
nevertheless , @entity12 must hope for a considerable improvement			2
@entity0 simply must find it from somewhere			0
there is absolutely no desire at @entity0 to sack @entity12			1
what would that say about the judgment of those who hired him ? like every manager , however , he will live or die by his results			0
currently his win ratio at @entity0 is 62 per cent			0
@entity3 ’s was 59 per cent			0
this is game number 99 of @entity12 ’s reign			0
by the time he reaches his century at home to @entity194 on saturday , he will hope to have something significant to reflect upon .			0
