a school has left parents furious after teachers took dozens of pupils on a forced shopping trip to a shoe store after they arrived for class wearing inappropriate footwear			1
parents were sent a bill for the ‘ approved shoes ’ despite never having asked the school to buy them			1
the school ’s bizarre approach at enforcing its strict uniform policy led to about 40 pupils being driven to the shop by teachers			1
but angry parents described the school ’s uniform policy as ‘ ridiculous ’			1
they claim teachers have been placing children in ‘ isolation ’ for uniform offences and have been lining up girls to inspect their skirts in a ‘ military manner ’			0
pupils were taken to a branch of @entity41 on separate occasions over two weeks after being deemed to be wearing inappropriate shoes			2
teachers paid £ 18 for each pair , which parents were then expected to pay at a later stage			1
one parent with two children at the school said she thought it was a joke at first			0
‘ i received a call saying they would take my son for some new shoes and i could pay later , ’ she said			2
pictured are examples of footwear approved by the school that were available for £ 18 a pair at @entity58 of shoes ‘ the lady i spoke to at the school seemed quite excited at the fact they were getting 10 per cent discount because they had bought so many pairs			1
’ on its website , @entity17 sets out its uniform which is says was developed with ' students , staff and governors '			1
the uniform was developed to be practical , fashionable and attractive and our students know that conflict over the uniform is inappropriate , ' the guidelines say , adding that students should adhere to uniform rules on the way to school , during the school day and on the way home			1
boys must wear a school blazer and tie with a white shirt and dark grey or charcoal trousers			0
it says boys should wear ' plain black shoes ' and that trainers , pumps and canvas shoes are not acceptable			0
girls must also wear a blazer and tie with the same shoe guidelines as boys except that they are allowed to wear low heel shoes or ankle boots with trousers			2
@entity102 , 33 , whose child is at the school , said that the new uniform policy was ‘ undermining parents ’			1
she said : ‘ i would be annoyed if one of my kids came back with some shoes and i did n’t know where they came from			0
’ mother @entity111 , 46 , said : ‘ this monday , they lined all the girls up in an almost military manner and inspected the length of their skirts			0
they are really clamping down on the poor kids			0
’ another parent said : ‘ if children do n’t have their top button done up , they get put in isolation			0
’ the school , which has more than 750 pupils , refused to say how many pairs of shoes it had bought but insisted it was providing ‘ support ’ so pupils could follow rules			1
@entity132 , 41 , the manager of the shoe store , estimated that 40 pupils had been taken to buy shoes by teachers in the past two weeks			1
‘ when they came in for the first time i recognised the teacher from @entity17 so i gave them a 10 per cent discount out of goodwill , ’ she said			2
‘ a lot of parents from the school have come in because they do n’t want their kids coming with their teachers in school time			2
’ she said the shop had sold 60 pairs of ‘ approved shoes ’ to pupils at the school in the past two weeks			1
@entity152 , pictured , supervisor of the @entity154 branch of @entity41 , said that the shop runs a scheme where they provide approved shoes for schools parents have hit out at the school 's actions after only learning of the shopping trip to @entity23 's @entity22 ( pictured ) when they were asked to pay the unexpected bill a supervisor at the store said a teacher had arrived with a group of three pupils on at least two occasions every day last week			1
school rules state that children must wear ‘ plain black shoes ’			2
the @entity17 was rated inadequate , the lowest possible grade , in its latest @entity175 inspection carried out in october this year			2
the inspection was the school ’s first since becoming an academy in 2012			0
when it was previously inspected as @entity181 it was deemed to be good overall			0
the move is believed to be part of the school ’s ‘ positive discipline ’ programme , introduced as a reaction to the @entity175 report			0
@entity189 said it was already having a significant effect on pupils ’ behaviour			0
school manager @entity194 said : ‘ we are supporting some pupils in ensuring they can follow the uniform policy			1
we wanted all the pupils to be in the correct uniform			0
‘ we informed parents before doing this and , on the whole , parents have been very supportive of the behavioural system			0
