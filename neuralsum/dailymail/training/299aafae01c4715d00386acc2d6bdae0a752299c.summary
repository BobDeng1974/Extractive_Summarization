by @entity0 published : 07:15 est , 27 august 2012 updated : 12:18 est , 27 august 2012 @entity2 interior minister @entity1 today ordered police to destroy a @entity5 camp in his political powerbase and to deport illegal immigrants living there			1
officers armed with truncheons and shields moved in to the settlement in the @entity14 suburb of @entity15 , where he was mayor for 11 years from 2001			1
by late morning more than 70 people including women and children had been evicted from caravans and makeshift huts , with most expected to be returned to @entity22			1
on the move : a man carried a foam mattress and other belongings after members of the @entity5 gang were ordered to move on today kicked out : women and children were also among the 70 people moved on from @entity15 this morning on guard : police stand in line in front of the city hall in @entity15 , @entity14 , after the @entity5 community were expelled time to go : a @entity5 couple prepare to gather their possessions together in @entity15 as their ramshackle camp was dismantled the raid is particularly significant because it shows the @entity44 firebrand is determined to ‘ clean up illegal immigrants in his own back yard ’ , said a party colleague			1
the source added : ‘ @entity1 particularly wants to end the @entity5 problem – by breaking up a camp in his constituency he is showing he means business			1
’ a deportation order for residents of the camp was signed by the local @entity44 mayor @entity57 who said : ‘ in addition to being unhealthy , the site is extremely dangerousness			1
’ the suburb of @entity14 from which the gang were ejected was the same area where @entity1 served as mayor for 11 years packing their bags : the ejection is particularly important as @entity1 had vowed to ' clean up illegal immigrants from his own back yard ' the @entity5 gang were forced to move on after @entity2 police arrived in the @entity14 suburb at 5am this morning hitting the road : minister @entity1 ordered the police to take action after declaring that @entity5 gipsy camps are a ' challenge ' to ' people living together ' temporary housing : many had expected @entity2 's new socialist government to have a relaxed approach to illegal immigrants , but @entity1 was quick to act against the @entity5 community who appeared in the @entity14 suburb where he used to be mayor the swift evacuation of the @entity5 gipsy camp in @entity15 , @entity14 , by @entity1 ( above ) today was the latest crackdown by the @entity2 government after similiar action in @entity88 and other @entity89 earlier this month			1
@entity2 's new socialist government appears to have ' declared war ' on illegal immigrants and followed through with action originally proposed by previous premier @entity93			0
many expected the more liberal socialists to show a more relaxed attitude toward immigrants , especially those from @entity100 member states			0
but mr @entity1 said the camps were a ‘ challenge ’ to ‘ people living together ’			1
he insisted the police would uphold all court orders aimed at dismantling them			2
mr @entity93 started a purge on @entity108 in the summer of 2010 , pointing to the fact that up to 15,000 were living in camps across @entity2			0
mr @entity93 even proposed that police travel to @entity22 to fight trafficking and other crimes committed there by @entity5			1
in turn , @entity5 groups accused mr @entity93 of ‘ ethnic cleansing ’ , pointing to the fact that gipsies had been targeted by the @entity120 during the @entity121			2
they said that the purge was all part of a generally racist strategy adopted by mr @entity93 against all foreign groups , including some six million muslims living in @entity2			0
mr @entity57 said the site overlapped a commuter train route into @entity14 , and was close to potentially fatal power lines			1
at 7am young children could be seen dragging suitcases and bags away from the site , along with bicyles			2
‘ the police arrived at 5am , ’ a 22 - year - old @entity22 called @entity136 told @entity2 radio			1
‘ i do not know where to go now - perhaps to a hotel , perhaps to a charity			0
’ hundreds of other @entity5 left a nearby wooded camp on @entity144 land after receiving an eviction order on sunday			2
mr @entity1 ordered the destruction of numerous @entity5 camps across @entity2 earlier this month , with sites broken up in @entity89 , @entity88 and @entity149 , as well as @entity14			1
the policy being pursued by @entity2 ’s socialist government was formulated by former conservative president @entity93 , who was frequently accused of pandering to the far right			0
his government linked @entity5 camps with crime , suggesting that many of the thieves and muggers operating in big cities were homeless @entity22			2
neighbours of the camps often complained about noise and anti-social behaviour , as well as serious crimes , said mr @entity1			2
humanitarian organisations have also linked the camps to ill health , including serious diseases such as tuberculosis			0
mr @entity93 started a purge on @entity108 in the summer of 2010 in @entity2 , where up to 15,000 live			0
in turn , @entity5 groups accused mr @entity93 of ‘ ethnic cleansing ’ , pointing to the fact that gipsies had been targeted by the @entity120 during the @entity121			2
they said that the purge was all part of a generally racist strategy adopted by mr @entity93 against all foreign groups , including some six million muslims living in @entity2			0
@entity22 has been a full member of the @entity100 since 2007 , and its citizens can enter @entity2 without a visa			0
but they must get residency permits if they want to settle long term and work			0
@entity184 , like @entity2 , has transitional controls on @entity22 seeking to settle in the @entity184			0
until next year only those @entity22 migrants who have a job or can support themselves are allowed to stay in @entity184			0
@entity2 prime minister @entity188 has called for a @entity190 meeting to make decisions “ at the @entity193 level ” on the @entity5 - many of whom also come from @entity195 @entity195			1
despite the evictions and deportations , mr @entity188 has pledged to make it easier for those @entity5 who are allowed to stay in @entity2 to get jobs			2
last thursday the @entity22 government issued a statement welcoming ‘ the @entity2 government ’s decision to ease the @entity22 and @entity195 citizens ’ access to the @entity2 labour market			0
’ @entity15 is a new town which was built in the 1960s to accommodate overspill from @entity14 ’s growing immigrant community			1
it now has one of the youngest populations in @entity2 – the average age is just 26 – with many residents coming from @entity219 and @entity218 backgrounds			0
despite the ethnic mix , and the fact that it is viewed as a ‘ socialist town ’ , locals in @entity15 frequently complain about non-regulated accommodation , which includes a large number of squats , as well as the kind of @entity5 camp which was shut down			1
@entity1 – who is nicknamed ‘ the @entity229 ’ – was returned as mayor of @entity15 during 2008 elections with 70 per cent of the vote			1
this was further evidence of @entity15 being the safest @entity44 constituency in @entity2			2
the legal method by which the @entity2 authorities are able to clear the camps is by claiming they are a hazard to the local community			0
in the @entity15 case , the local mayor acted on local concerns by arguing that the settlement created public health problems , and was also dangerously close to a commuter railways line			1
made to move : two guards stand in the foreground as a @entity5 man lugs his possessions away from their temporary home in @entity15 , @entity14 a young girl stands next to a pushchair laden with belongings , after her family were expelled from their camp this morning officially he then ‘ applied ’ to a local judge who – on @entity144 advice – agreed that the camp should be ‘ evacuated ’			1
in reality , the interior minister would have the ultimate say on whether camps should or should not be shut down			0
of the @entity5 kicked off sites in cities like @entity88 and @entity89 earlier this month , some 90 per cent have since been deported by plane			2
adults returning to @entity271 receive 300 euros , while children receive 150 euros			0
this means that a small , impoverished family can easily ‘ earn ’ more than 1000 euros from a single deportation			0
accordingly , many families are more than happy to be deported for a few weeks , before returning to @entity2 at a later date			0
new life : @entity5 gipsies dismantle a fridge and other domestic goods after being given the order by police in the early hours police action : gipsy women and children appeared to be in fairly good spirits even after being made to pack up their temporary hut homes and find space elsewhere in @entity14 new start : a @entity5 gipsy woman stands over some cooking equipment as her family contemplate being moved on from their temporary home in @entity15 , @entity14			1

@entity1 orders police to remove @entity5 community from @entity15 , @entity14
*hardline* minister had served in @entity15 as mayor for 11 years
