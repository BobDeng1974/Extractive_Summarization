fish soup with tofu and rice , stir - fried pork with vegetables and baked chicken with stuffed grape leaves ... these are just some of the exotic lunches school children from around the world tuck into			1
the widely different meals from @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 are all fresh and wholesome , with fish , steak and vegetables featuring prominently			1
but in stark contrast , the @entity22 and @entity24 lunch trays feature processed foods such as popcorn chicken , frankfurters , cookies , and beans from a tin			1
the 12 - year - old launched the blog in 2012 as a school writing project with assistance from her father , @entity85 , written under the pseudonym ' veg ' ( @entity87 – truth from tasting ) , with the subtitle ' one primary school pupil 's daily dose of school dinners ' , the blog features daily entries on the £ 2 school meal that @entity73 / ' veg ' has chosen that day , her thoughts on the food and its quality , a count of the number of hairs , a health rating , a picture , and marks out of 10 based on a ' food - o - meter '			0
@entity73 , who has been invited to talk in international conferences is currently raising money for @entity75 charity @entity108 , through her @entity110 page			0
@entity108 - which began in 2002 as a one - off school feeding programme - currently provides daily life changing meals to over 989,000 hungry children in @entity115 , @entity116 , the @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119			0
the surprising pictures show just how the @entity22 and @entity24 measures up to the rest of the world when it comes to feeding schoolchildren			2
while the majority of lunches feature fresh foods , @entity24 tray is packed with processed items			1
similarly the typical @entity22 school lunch is sadly lacking in fresh vegetables , featuring a baked potato , sausage and beans from a tin , and a half corn on the cob with a melon slice to follow			1
lunch in an @entity141 school is rice with a piece of meat and purple cabbage			1
they also have bread and a get a cup of chocolate drink @entity22 school dinner of frankfurters and beans , a baked potato , corn on the cob , slice of melon and a box drink @entity159 , a nutritional therapist at @entity160 said to @entity161 : ' looking at the lunches from across the world , it seems mixed in terms of how balanced the diets are			2
looks can be deceiving , since while the @entity17 lunch looks very healthy - the focus is on starchy carbohydrates , starchy vegetables and fruit			0
so for me it 's lacking in adequate protein or green leafy vegetables			0
ms @entity177 thinks the schoolchildren in @entity16 , @entity14 and @entity15 have the best lunches			1
' my favourite is the @entity14 meal since fermented foods are great for gut health and the children are given a starchy carbohydrate such as rice , but also green and colourful vegetables and fish – boosting protein levels , ' she said			1
' the @entity193 meal was also very good since they are leaning towards giving vegetables and meat rather than too much bread or pasta and the @entity193 cheese will give some protein , fat soluble nutrients and calcium			2
' the @entity15 meal was as good as the @entity14 , since there is an emphasis on meat and plant proteins and vegetables			1
we still focus on starchy carbohydrates to fill us up but children can not have a nutritionally balanced diet without adequate good fats , proteins and a wide and large variety of vegetables			0
' the @entity218 food looked a little devoid of vegetables			0
@entity13 and @entity11 also looked good - although @entity11 could have had more vegetables			1
' balanced diet : @entity18 children get pasta , fish , two kinds of salad , rocket and caprese , a bread roll and grapes in @entity17 lunch is mainly a vegetarian affair of pea soup , carrots , beetroot salad , crusty roll and sweet pancake with berries to finish school lunch in @entity241 , @entity11 ( left ) : white flesh peaches , strawberries and yogurt melts , cous - cous , broccoli , cucumbers and roasted salmon ; ( right ) : poached apple pears , strawberries and blue berries , boiled swede and fresh garden peas but she was n't impressed with the @entity22 or @entity24 school dinners			1
' the healthier @entity22 meal trumped the other @entity22 meal comparison			0
the less healthy option gave the children very cheap looking sausages , a potato , watermelon and a corn on the cob			0
so quite low in good quality protein and almost non-existent vegetables			0
the @entity24 meal was very carbohydrate dense , ' she continued			2
in @entity16 , children start their meal with a generous slab of @entity272			2
this is followed by a hearty portion of rare steak , served with two types of vegetables - carrots and green beans			2
and you wo n't find sweets on this lunch tray			0
the healthy theme continues into dessert , with the young ones tucking into kiwi fruit and apples			0
@entity14 children tuck into broccoli and peppers , fried rice with tofu , fermented cabbage and fish soup @entity272 , green beans , carrot , rare steak and pudding of kiwi fruit and apples is served in @entity193 schools a meal of traditional flavours : @entity15 's rice and black beans , baked plantain , pork with peppers and coriander , green salad and a seeded roll the @entity14 lunch is equally as impressive			1

on the side is kimchi , the traditional @entity14 condiment of fermented cabbage			1

this is accompanied by a small portion of pasta , a simple caprese salad of tomatoes , mozzarella and basil , a crusy roll and a bunch of grapes			0
most of the schools have kept to traditional foods for the school lunch			2

this is served with a seeded roll , peppers with red cabbage and half an orange for dessert			0

wholesome : seeded roll , shrimp with brown rice , gazpacho and tri-colour peppers			0
