the two men most @entity2 fans wished were still working together at the club were spotted as sir @entity4 enjoyed a leisurely stroll with @entity6			1
the pair appeared to be in good spirits as they walked through @entity10 on wednesday afternoon and were perhaps talking about the imminent arrival of @entity12 to @entity13			2
@entity4 and @entity17 left @entity2 after the @entity29 won their 20th @entity31 crown at a counter at the end of the 2012/13 season			1
however , following the duo 's @entity13 's departures the club 's fortunes quickly soon changed			0
@entity4 and @entity17 's replacements , @entity40 and @entity41 , endured a nightmare debut season in their new roles as the red half of @entity46 finished seventh in the league and without @entity50 football next season			0
@entity40 ' failure as boss led to his sacking in april with @entity12 set to take charge once @entity22 's @entity21 is over			0
poor : @entity40 was sacked as @entity2 boss in april after a nightmare season for the club imminent arrival : @entity12 ( right ) will take charge of @entity2 after @entity22 's @entity21 is over			2

sir @entity4 and @entity6 were spotted in @entity10
the pair enjoyed a trophy - laden spell together at @entity2
the duo both left the club at the end of the 2012/13 season
