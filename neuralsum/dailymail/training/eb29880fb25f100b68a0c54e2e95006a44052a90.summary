at least 400 @entity2 @entity1 have joined the jihadist fanatics bringing terror to @entity5 and @entity6 , @entity0 warned last night			1
in his first statement to mps since the crisis in @entity5 erupted more than a week ago , the foreign secretary said security chiefs were becoming increasingly alarmed at the prospect that @entity2 extremists waging jihad in the region could bring their murderous philosophy and methods to the streets of the @entity2			1
he said some were ' inevitably fighting with @entity19 ' - the extremist group whose barbaric tactics and seizure of a huge swathes of @entity5 have provoked international outrage			2
mr @entity0 also revealed @entity2 was on the brink of an astonishing diplomatic u-turn over @entity27 , in the hope that @entity29 may be able to help prevent the total collapse of its neighbour			1
@entity5 has been plunged into its bloodiest crisis since the withdrawal of @entity39 troops in 2011			1
@entity19 rebels , led by @entity48 , are said to have murdered 1,700 soldiers last week			0
@entity27 's president @entity50 has said he is was willing to take part in talks with other countries and has claimed to have had written correspondence with @entity39 president @entity55			1
mr @entity0 revealed he had also spoken to @entity27 foreign minister @entity35			1
the foreign secretary told the @entity57 : ' we do have , over many decades including now , important common interests with @entity27			2
that includes stability in @entity5 and in @entity62			2
' there are many other issues - dealing with the narcotics trade and so on - on which @entity27 and the @entity2 have common interests			1
@entity2 will ' inevitably ' be fighting alongside the extremist group which has overrun large parts of @entity5 , foreign secretary @entity0 told @entity9			1
mr @entity0 said it was possible that @entity2 who had travelled to @entity6 to fight in the country 's bloody civil war could be among militants in the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) , which the foreign secretary called the ' most violent and brutal militant group in the @entity77 '			1
in a @entity57 statement updating mps on the crisis , mr @entity0 repeated his position that there was no prospect of a @entity2 military intervention to tackle @entity19 in @entity5			1
but he said counter-terrorism support could be offered to the government in @entity87 and a @entity88 ( @entity88 ) team had been sent to the country to assist embassy staff in contingency planning			0
he said the majority of @entity19 ' members were @entity5 or @entity95 but ' it also includes a significant number of foreign fighters among its ranks '			2
mr @entity0 said : ' as i have previously told this @entity102 , we estimate the number of @entity2 - linked individuals fighting in @entity6 to include approximately 400 @entity2 nationals and other @entity2 - linked individuals who could present a particular risk should they return to the @entity2			1
' he said ' some of these , inevitably ' are ' fighting with ' @entity19			0
the foreign secretary said : ' we are taking action in three areas : promoting political unity among those who support a democratic @entity5 state and stability in the region ; offering assistance where appropriate and possible and alleviating humanitarian suffering			1
' we have made it clear this does not involve planning a military intervention by the @entity2			1
' ' that is a very good argument for trying to advance our bilateral relations			0
of course , we do also have to deal with the issue of @entity27 's nuclear programme			2
' we do need @entity27 to make its contribution to stability in the region by seizing support for sectarian groups in other parts of the region			2
' it came amid reports that @entity29 is considering military support to the @entity135 - led administration in @entity5			2
representatives of @entity27 and the @entity138 powers met in @entity139 to discuss international concerns about @entity29 ’s nuclear ambitions			2
the @entity142 declined to discuss the content of mr @entity0 ’s call			0
the foreign secretary will brief mps on the latest situation in an oral statement to the @entity102 this afternoon			0
prime minister @entity150 ’s official spokesman indicated that the @entity2 saw a role for regional powers such as @entity27 in supporting the @entity87 government , telling reporters at a @entity156 media briefing : ' in terms of the decisions around the immediate security response in @entity5 , those are for the @entity5 authorities to take			1
' is there a wider regional issue here and is there a role in the region supporting the @entity5 government in trying as much as possible to take a broad - based and inclusive approach going forward and avoiding some of the risks of a sectarian approach , as the foreign secretary was talking about ? yes			1
' is there a role for the region and the international community as a whole to support this approach of unity and co-operation - as the foreign secretary described it this morning ? yes , i think there is a regional angle to it			0
' former foreign secretary @entity186 welcomed the government 's move to open talks with the @entity27 - but called on mr @entity0 to be ' more positive ' about @entity2 's relations with the @entity77 power			1
he told the @entity193 's world at one radio programme : ' there is a strategic necessity and opportunity to engage more with @entity27			0
' a map of northern @entity5 shows the towns and cities taken over by @entity202 insurgents and @entity204 @entity203 @entity2 will not block well - judged , targeted action by the @entity39 against @entity5 , @entity37 said			1
the deputy prime minister suggested the @entity2 could allow its bases to be used to launch attacks on @entity19 forces			2
speaking at a press confernece in @entity211 , mr @entity37 said : ' we will not be providing active frontline military resources to the action taken			2
' but we are certainly not going to stand in the way of action that is well - judged and well - targeted			0
i am not suggesting we will rule out passive assistance even if we are not going to embark on our own active role			2
' we are not going to start deploying @entity2 military forces in @entity5			1
we will equally not stand in the way of @entity39 , in particular , seeking to take well - judged , targeted action			1
' that is why it is sensible of president @entity55 to take his time to assess options			0
obviously we will be comparing notes			0
' but conservative @entity229 , chairman of the @entity230 , warned against fuelling the unrest by involving @entity29 because it is seen by @entity202 ' as part of the problem '			0
he told the programme : ' involving them will strengthen @entity239 's hand , it will provide resources to @entity87 but it is not going to solve the fundamental problem , which is regaining the trust of the @entity202 population			0
' they are going to be alienated by a stronger @entity27 hand in @entity5 politics			2
' he added : ' it 's a horrendous situation			0
nobody should doubt that this is almost the worst nightmare that the @entity251 imagined in @entity5			0
' at the weekend @entity27 's president @entity50 refused to rule out working with @entity2 and the @entity39 to defeat the @entity5 insurgents			1
he said : ' when the @entity39 takes action , then one can think about cooperation			2
until today , no specific request for help has been demanded			0
but we are ready to help within international law			0
' it is not clear how talks with @entity27 , which refers to the @entity39 as the ' @entity262 ' , would take place , and other countries have expressed concern that any deal could damage negotiations on @entity29 's nuclear program			1
amid international outrage at the atrocity , president @entity55 is weighing up what help to give @entity87 to counter the land - grab by the @entity274 - inspired @entity19			0
the @entity2 government has ruled out any new military intervention , in part because the @entity57 last year voted against action in @entity6			1
mr @entity0 told @entity279 ’s today programme : ‘ so many situations can arise in the world that we can not predict that to absolutely rule all things out in all circumstances tends to be a mistake			0
‘ but in this situation today , in @entity5 , with what we ’ve seen in recent days , are we looking at a @entity2 military intervention ? no , we ’re not			1
i ca n’t be clearer than that			0
’ @entity2 has already offered humanitarian assistance for the @entity5 people displaced in the north , and mr @entity0 hinted that @entity2 special forces could be offered			1
' i ’ve said that we might be able to help with counter-terrorism expertise			0
we are looking at that now , ' he said			0
however , mr @entity0 , who also voted for the 2003 war , denied that the invasion had itself been a mistake			0
' no , i do n’t think the invasion itself was a mistake			0
i have always thought that many mistakes occurred in the aftermath of the invasion			0
‘ it ’s entirely possible to say that it was the right thing to remove @entity309 , but that mistakes were made in the aftermath of that			0
’ deputy prime minister @entity37 said @entity2 would not attempt to ' stand in the way ' of a well - judged @entity39 initiative to restore order in @entity5			1
mr @entity37 told a @entity317 press conference : ' we are not providing active , frontline resources to any action that is taken but of course we will want to talk to the @entity39 and other allies about what can be done			1
' we are certainly not going to stand in the way of action that is well - judged and well - targeted in order to try to re-assert some semblance of order in @entity5			2
i think only the @entity39 can deploy the kind of resources that may make a difference			0
