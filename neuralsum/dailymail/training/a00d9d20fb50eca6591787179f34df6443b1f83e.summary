by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity3 scientists claim to have spotted the ‘ jaws and skeleton ’ of a mystery creature which could be ' the @entity8 @entity7 ’			1
divers braved temperatures of minus @entity11 to investigate long - held beliefs that a monster lives at the bottom of the remote @entity15 4,500 miles east of @entity16 in the @entity8 wilderness			1
and the geologists told local media their underwater scanner found the remains of a jaws and skeleton which could be the rumoured beast nicknamed ' the @entity25 '			1
could this be @entity26 ? this picture is said to show the mystery beast of the lake popping its head above water ' there have been all sort of hypothesises about what kind of creature it could be : a giant pike , a relic reptile or an amphibia			1
we did n't manage to prove or to disprove these versions ...			0
. we managed to find remains of jaws and skeleton of some animal , ' @entity42 told the @entity47			1
tales of a monster measuring up to 33 feet in length predate the accounts of @entity7 in @entity52 , say @entity3 academics			1
last year a picture emerged which appeared to show ' @entity26 ' poking her head out of the water			0
top diver @entity57 led a @entity59 mission to one of the world ’s most mysterious lakes which is an average 170ft in depth but has an underwater crevice reaching down to 262ft			2
mystery : @entity15 in the @entity8 wilderness has baffled scientists for years as it does not freeze over in the winter @entity8 the lake puzzles scientists because unlike millions of others in @entity8 it does not freeze solid in winter but maintains a temperature of at least plus @entity73 on the surface			2
more than 3,000 ft above sea level , it is in the same district as @entity78 , the coldest inhabited village on earth			0
native @entity81 and yakut people have long claimed a ‘ @entity26 ’ lurks in its depths			0
known as ‘ the @entity25 ’ , testimony dating back to the 19th century says the monster has enormous jaws			1
images have also recently emerged from a 2006 scientific trip to the lake when strange objects - one of 21ft 4in ( 6.5 metres ) in length - were recorded on a @entity94 215 portable fish - finder at a depth of 138 to 197 feet			2
evidence : scientists found a strange large object using their echo device in 2006 , left , and made an artist 's impression , right , of how they believe the creature might look ' it was our fourth or fifth day at the lake when our echo sounding device registered a huge object in the water under our boat , ' said associate professor @entity110 , of @entity111 , of her own close encounter a decade ago			2
it was clearly alive and too large to be one of the dozen or so known fish species in the lake			0
' the object was very dense , of homogeneous structure , surely not a fish nor a shoal of fish , and it was above the bottom , ' she said			0
' i was very surprised but not scared nor shocked , after all we did not see this animal , we only registered a strange object in the water			0
but i can clearly say - at the moment , as a scientist , i can not offer you any explanation of what this object might be			0

divers say underwater scanner picked up jaws and skeleton of beast
