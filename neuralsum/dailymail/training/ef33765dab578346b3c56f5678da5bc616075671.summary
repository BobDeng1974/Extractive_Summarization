by @entity0 last updated at 11:47 pm on 15th november 2011 there 's a commonly - held belief that old and new money do n’t mix. so when property developer @entity4 built a £ 2.5million mock - @entity6 mansion next to aristocrat @entity9 ’s @entity8 pile , the risk of things going awry were always high			1
the pair clashed almost instantly over boundaries and then over a tree			0
but things reached a head when lawyer mr @entity9 , the descendant of a 16th century @entity18 count , was caught on cctv smashing his neighbour ’s ornamental lights			1
high - flier ... and not bad climber : @entity9 , left , clambered over his neighbour @entity4 's garden wall and smashed five @entity6 lamps with a scaffolding pole mr @entity4 , 37 , said he was stunned when he spotted five lamps , costing £ 2,000 each , had been vandalised			1
as his house is covered by @entity19 cameras he reviewed the film and was shocked to discover footage of mr @entity9 peering over the wall ‘ like a meerkat ’			2
@entity35 showed mr @entity9 , dressed in a pinstripe suit , clambering over the adjoining wall clutching a long scaffolding pole			2
the senior law partner , who was awarded an @entity18 knighthood and has a family seat in @entity42 , then smashed the five @entity6 lamps adorning mr @entity4 ’s courtyard and driveway			1
a furious mr @entity4 called police and mr @entity47 , 56 , a father - of - three , was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage			1
after being questioned he admitted the offence , expressed regret , and was issued with a caution			0
the incident was the culmination of a two - year feud between the pair who live in a leafy millionaire ’s row in @entity59 , @entity60			0
boundary dispute : this image of mr @entity9 's house was taken from mr @entity4 's house mr @entity4 's home , where some of the damaged @entity6 lamps are visible on the walls of the house two of the damaged lamps on mr @entity4 's property , which he says cost up to £ 2,000 each they had earlier become locked in a bitter boundary dispute which escalated after mr @entity4 chopped back the branches of a sycamore which he said were overhanging his new property			1
mr @entity4 , the managing director of @entity78 , said he was worried branches could snap during the winter and damage his roof and also feared that falling leaves could block his drains			2
but mr @entity9 , a senior partner at @entity85 solicitors in @entity86 , complained the tree surgeon had trespassed on to his property to chop back some branches			1
police were called in over the lights row last month			0
in a statement mr @entity4 said : ‘ i checked the @entity19 and could not believe it			0
mr @entity9 popped up like a meerkat peering over the wall			0
then fully - suited he dropped into my courtyard and started smashing up the lights			0
' my first instinct was to go round and confront him , but i thought the best thing to do was call the police			0

the lawyer , whose mother was @entity18 , is a descendant of an @entity18 count , ennobled for heroics on the battlefield during the 16th century			0
