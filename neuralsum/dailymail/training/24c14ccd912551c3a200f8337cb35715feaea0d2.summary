by @entity1 reporter published : 18:14 est , 17 november 2013 updated : 21:52 est , 17 november 2013 a player for the @entity3 walked away from a play sunday afternoon with more than a successful tackle when he managed to get a fistful of his opponent 's hair			2
during the @entity3 home game against @entity11 , a @entity8 running back was slammed after a short run by defensive end @entity13			1
and when @entity13 emerged from the pile , he held a fat fistful of @entity18 's dreadlocks			1
hair raising ! @entity3 defender @entity13 came out of a pileup in a sunday game against the @entity8 with a fistful of hair @entity13 , 33 , held the hair aloft for a moment like a trophy			1
then , perhaps realizing that hair does n't bronze well , defiantly chucked it all to the ground			0
the hair - raising tackle has occurred in the past -- to such tress - sporting players as @entity32 -- but not in recent memory has the player lost the hair			0
ouch : @entity18 , a @entity8 running back ( pictured here during his years at @entity38 ) is now short several dreadlocks write caption here @entity42 victory : after the pride subsided , or perhaps after he realized hair does n't make a great trophy , @entity13 tossed the locks to the ground now 24 - year - old @entity18 has little to be do short of waiting for it to grow back			1
he wore his hair outside his helmet at his own peril			0
according to @entity54 rules , yanking exposed hair is fair play			0
the rule , implemented in 2003 , says that it is legal to grab a player 's hair because it 's deemed part of the uniform			2
@entity62 may have gotten the last laugh , though			0
his @entity8 trounced @entity13 's @entity3 27 - 14			1
cold comfort : @entity18 can do little but lick his wounds and wait for his hair to grow back			1
since 2003 , hair has been deemed ' part of the uniform ' and legal to pull in a tackle			0
his @entity8 beat @entity13 's @entity3 , however , 24 to 14			2

@entity74 @entity73 defender @entity13 yanked out the locks of @entity8 running back @entity18
while tackling a player by his hair is legal and does *occasionally* happen , it is n't often ripped completely out
