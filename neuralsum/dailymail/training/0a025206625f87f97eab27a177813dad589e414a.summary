by @entity0 published : 08:04 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 12:56 est , 12 march 2014 the @entity2 has been warned that it faces ' a global storm of protest ' after it unveiled plans to build homes for soldiers near @entity8			1
outraged experts claim that the houses would block the world - famous solstice sunrise at the @entity14 monument			1
@entity16 bosses want to build 4,000 homes for soldiers and their families returning from @entity20 on an old airfield overlooking the monument , but experts said the buildings would occupy the exact spot that the sun peeks over the horizon on the longest day of the year			1
popular : the solstice is watched by thousands of people every year , with the sun peeking through the @entity8 stones plans : the proposed sites for the @entity2 housing near @entity8 , just to the north - east of the site lighting the way : this map shows the direction of the sunlight at @entity8 during the summer solstice , and how it intersects the @entity2 's proposed housing site it ’s an event that ’s watched by some 20,000 people and leading archaeo - astronomer @entity44 predicted there would be uproar if the plan goes ahead			1
the @entity8 guide said when the airfield , at @entity51 , was built in 1910 , military chiefs left a gap for the sunrise and bosses should similarly respect the ancient monument			1
he said : ‘ @entity8 is the focus of a @entity58 of enormous cultural importance			1
controversy : the @entity2 wants to build houses on a site that experts say is directly in line with the summer solstice sunrise @entity8 was built and rebuilt over 600 years in three main phases			1
the first - begun in @entity67 - saw the creation of a ditch and bank which later enclosed a circle of 56 holes for posts or stones			0
around @entity76 the site was transformed into two circles of 82 blue stones brought from the @entity80 mountains			0
then , 150 years later , the ancient @entity81 set up 50 - ton sarsen stones quarried at @entity83 , 25 miles away			0
there are dozens of theories about @entity8 's purpose			1
at least 52 bodies were cremated and buried at @entity8 , leading some experts to conclude the site was used for elaborate funerals			1
some believe the monument was a centre of medicine with the circle 's creators believing the @entity80 blue stones had magical powers			0
the human remains on the site belong to sick people who came to be cured			2
others think it is a calendar and observatory as the stones are aligned with the summer and winter solstices - the longest and shortest days of the year			2
the site , they say , would be used to predict eclipses and to mark lunar cycles			0
meanwhile , believers in @entity113 superstitions claim @entity8 is a centre of mystical lines of energy that cross @entity81			1
believers in alien life say @entity8 was a landing site for flying saucers			1
‘ it is internationally famous , instantly recognisable and the solstitial alignment of the monument is intrinsic to its original purpose			2
‘ to propose building across this alignment invites a global storm of protest from groups as diverse as heritage bodies , astronomers , prehistorians , @entity133 , religious orders and the wider public			0
‘ the @entity2 needs to demonstrate that it is fully sensitive to the @entity58 in order to avoid the potential outrage and reputational damage , not only to itself but also to @entity81 in the eyes of the world			2
‘ when @entity51 was first established in the early @entity144 , a series of aeroplane sheds was built along the east side of @entity146			0
‘ these early military and civilian aviators were keenly aware of their responsibility and so a wide space was deliberately left between the aeroplane sheds at the north end and those further south in order to allow the @entity156 sunrise to continue to shine unobstructed down to @entity8			1
’ he said the gap is already partially obstructed by a copse of tall trees which the @entity16 should also remove to completely restore the sightline from @entity8 to the horizon			2
he added : ‘ this possibility will be entirely removed if the sites are built upon			0
’ @entity165 and @entity133 is understood to be considering mr @entity44 's report before commenting , but @entity168 bosses agreed with the expert			2
curator @entity170 said : ‘ today , if you look towards the horizon there are some trees but even in 1910 when there were some air hangars built they left a gap between them so that you could still see the sunrise			0
’ pagan leader @entity181 , 59 , vowed to fight any development that would threaten @entity8			2
' i oppose completely , ' he said			0
' i will be the first person blocking it if they decide to go ahead with the plans			0
' obviously i understand there is a need to build these houses but there is no need to build them in the way of the light			0
' what you 've got to remember is that around 30,000 people descend here every summer for the solstice			1
' all they need to do is alter the plans just ever so slightly			0
the sunrise has been observed for thousands of years - everyone appreciates that and therefore they have n't threatened that			0
' for the sake of building a few miles away it would be tragic to destroy something so important to so many people			0
' i will oppose anything that threatens @entity8			2
' the @entity2 is currently holding a consultation on the massive expansion of the army bases to the north and east of @entity8			1
it disputes that the project will affect the site			0
an @entity2 spokesperson said : ‘ the @entity2 is not considering any development that will affect @entity8			1
' we are aware of concerns about the proposed development in the @entity51 area and will be meeting with all interested parties to address these issues			0
' theories : some people think that @entity8 was built to heal people - others that it 's a landing zone for alien spacecraft			1
