' whooping cough ( also known as ‘ pertussis ’ ) is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the lungs and airways			2
the government health website says the disease is ' highly infectious and most serious in babies under the age of 12 months '			1
babies are at greatest risk of infection until they can have at least two doses of the vaccine ( minimum 4 months old ) as the mother ’s antibodies do not provide reliable protection			2
it ’s very rare for children who have been immunised against whooping cough to get the disease – and if they do , it ’s usually not as serious			2
symptoms the condition usually begins with a persistent dry and irritating cough that progresses to intense bouts of coughing			0
these are followed by a distinctive ‘ whooping ’ noise , which is how the condition gets its name			0
the early symptoms of whooping cough are often similar to those of a common cold and may include : these early symptoms of whooping cough can last for one to two weeks , before becoming more severe			2
the second stage of whooping cough is often called the paroxysmal stage and is characterised by intense bouts of coughing			2
each bout of coughing usually lasts between one and two minutes			0
infants younger than six months may not make the ‘ whoop ’ sound after coughing , but they may start gagging or gasping , and may temporarily stop breathing			0

' it 's important to listen to the experts , ' mr @entity231 said			0
' whooping cough is lethal in babies and in adults people can be absent from work for the persistent cough , it 's a nasty infection			1
' according to the department 's notifiable disease report , there have been 244 cases of whooping cough in @entity114 in the year to date , compared to 292 cases for the corresponding period last year and 232 cases in the first 10 weeks of 2013			2

in 2013 , the @entity219 report said that despite a long - standing immunisation program , ' pertussis remains highly prevalent in @entity111 and the least well controlled of all vaccine - preventable diseases '			1
' epidemics occur every 3 to 4 years			0
in unvaccinated populations , these outbreaks can be very large			0
in vaccinated populations , outbreaks are smaller , with greatly reduced mortality and morbidity , and may continue to occur every 3 to 4 years or be more widely spaced , ' the report said .			0
