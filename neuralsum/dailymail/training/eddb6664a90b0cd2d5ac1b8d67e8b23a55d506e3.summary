by @entity0 published : 11:21 est , 25 november 2013 updated : 11:42 est , 26 november 2013 how do shops trick us into spending more money ? soft , lulling music to make us feel relaxed ; changing rooms tucked away at the back of the shop so we can only reach them by walking past all the other sections ; skinny mirrors to buoy our confidence ; pleasant smells , and cheap bags of sweets by the tills that will catch us out as impulse buys : there are some cheeky high street sales tricks of which we 're all aware			1
but what about the small floor tiles , the complex escalator arrangements , the messy sales rails and the enormous supermarket trollies ? how do these sneaky in - store features encourage us , subconsciously , to spend , spend , spend ever more , more , more ? @entity25 , retail strategist at advertising agency @entity26 , has shared some of the industry 's most hush - hush secrets with @entity30			1
keep them in mind and maybe this @entity33 you 'll exit the shopping centre with only the things you really need ...			1
orientation shops , especially the larger department stores and supermarkets , are cleverly laid out to encourage you explore new areas of the floor and encounter new products you would have otherwise overlooked			1
to encourage you into the building escalators are placed at the front of the shop , but you may find that the only route down is via stairs at the back of the store 1			1
have you noticed that changing rooms are positioned right at the back of the shop ? in the same thinking , store layout is periodically altered to ensure we do n't march straight to what we need but instead have to encounter new temptations			2
when traveling up or down escalators you 'll find you have to walk all the way around the stairwell to find the connecting escalator			2

@entity66 - bumps to slow us down and linger for longer amongst the products on offer we are presented with a series of disruptions			2
' power displays ' get in the way of a straight path , distracting our line of sight and altering our speed			2
mirrors bring out the vanity in us as it ’s proven we often will pause for a second to check our reflections			1
mirrors bring out the vanity in us as it 's proven we often will pause for a second to check our reflections sense of perspective @entity83 subliminal tricks come into play here			1
the soundtrack to our shopping experience is often soft - tempo relaxing music , to lull us into a relaxed , even hypnotic state ; often there will be no vocals to avoid distraction			1
floor tiles may be smaller to make us feel we are walking too fast and so we slow down and admire the goods on offer accordingly			2
changing room mirrors might be distorted to make us look longer and leaner , sadly making us think the clothes we are trying on are more flattering than they are			1
supermarket trolleys tend to be much bigger than they really need to be , so they fill up slowly leave us with plenty of room to keep adding more items			2
floor tiles may be smaller to make us feel we are walking too fast and so we slow down and admire the goods on offer accordingly @entity106 unlike the buy - one - get - one - free offers on full price ( or inflated priced items as we are hearing about ) retailers are less eager for shoppers to use up their shopping budgets on the sales items where their margins are smaller			0
clearance items are usually tucked away at the back of the shop , so we are enticed by the more expensive goods on our way to the bargains			0
sales goods are often poorly organised , with unclear pricing , sizes and layout , frustrating us and tempting us back to the beautifully presented full price products			0

they will constantly try to ‘ up - sell ’			0
when shown the matching gloves , earrings or socks for under your new boots we find that even if we do n’t need it , we will want it			0
you also see this on line , where items are suggested based on your purchase or viewing history			0
when handed baskets upon entering we are made to feel obligated to fill them with more than one item before we get to the tills			0
then of course we ’ve all noticed the array of low - cost goods positioned by tills to encourage impulse purchases			1
an array of low - cost goods is positioned by tills to encourage impulse purchases tricks on the eye such a simple but effective trick is to catch our eyes			1
when hurried we will often grab the first thing we see , or quickly glance and believe the value promotions without considering the maths			0
in supermarkets you will always find the premium , branded items , at eye level			0
promotions , like the controversial bulk deals we are hearing about at the moment are also made clearly visible , at eye line height , or near changing rooms , escalators and tills			0
prices are labelled so that at a glance we think the deal is better than it is			0
horizontal numbers are placed further apart so that the price deal seems greater , or sale prices are displayed in a much bigger font to emphasise the difference			0
we are also made accustomed to labelling colours and with an instinct of trust we follow the cue to purchased , not realising that more sneaky tactics are at play , as we have learned in the news this week			0
