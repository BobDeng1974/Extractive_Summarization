health secretary @entity0 has asked @entity1 to work with cancer charities in the hope that more life - extending drugs will be approved for use @entity0 will today order a review of the system for approving cancer drugs amid criticism that thousands of @entity12 patients are denied life - extending treatment			1
the health secretary will tell the @entity1 to work with cancer charities and researchers			1
he will also announce a 40 per cent rise in resources to pay for vital treatments blocked by @entity1			2
he is to increase the @entity20 from £ 200million to £ 280million for the next two years to improve access to drugs currently deemed too expensive			1
@entity1 has been ordered to review its system for approving drugs following complaints that it bases its trials solely on patients with no other underlying health conditions			1
it is being asked to include evidence from patients with other conditions , a move that could see more drugs being approved			1
health chiefs have been told to renegotiate with the drugs industry to drive down the price of cancer treatments			0
‘ it ’s vitally important that as many people as possible have access to these pioneering , life - enhancing drugs , ’ said mr @entity0 , adding that the fund ‘ has an essential role in helping us realise our ambition to be the best place in @entity43 to survive cancer ’			1
two more drugs have been approved for immediate inclusion on the @entity20 list as a result of today ’s decision			1
the first is @entity54 , a drug for treating advanced prostate cancer			0
the second is @entity58 , which will become available for patients with the rare blood condition myelodysplastic syndrome for the first time			0
officials will also now review the list of drugs approved by the fund ‘ to ensure patients are offered the most effective drugs for their condition and [ so that ] new drugs can be added to the list ’			2
the @entity20 was established in april 2011 following a public outcry at decisions by @entity1 to block certain treatments on cost grounds			1
it is credited with helping more than 55,000 cancer patients by paying for costly drugs that would not otherwise have been provided on the @entity12			2
but critics complain it is little more than a sticking plaster and are pressing for fundamental reform of @entity1			2
the organisation , which is responsible for deciding which drugs are made available on the @entity12 , is blamed by some for unfairly blocking drugs it deems to be poor value for money			0
@entity54 , a drug designed to fight prostate cancer ( pictured ) , has already been approved under the new rules			0
mr @entity0 will also increase the @entity20 from £ 200million to £ 280million for the next two years @entity1 says it makes no sense to fund drugs that can extend life for a few weeks or months but cost tens of thousands of pounds per patient , when the money could be better spent on other treatments			1
but critics point out that it rejects almost two - thirds of the cancer treatments it assesses – meaning that patients in @entity101 are denied drugs that are available in other parts of the world			0
@entity1 came under fire earlier this month when it rejected the drug @entity107 , which can extend life for women with an aggressive form of breast cancer for six months , but which costs £ 90,000 per patient			1
the @entity112 last night said the drug was available via the @entity20 , and that funding for the scheme has been guaranteed until at least 2016			0
cancer charities welcomed the increased funding and said a thorough review was vital			0
@entity119 , chief executive of @entity120 , said : ‘ the current system of pricing and approving drugs is broken and is letting down cancer patients			0
‘ @entity1 and the pharmaceutical industry must show greater flexibility and a genuine willingness to work together in the interests of all cancer patients			2
’ @entity129 , chief executive of the @entity130 , described the funding increase and review as ‘ an important start ’ in ensuring the @entity20 is sustainable in the long - term			0
@entity135 , chief executive of @entity136 , also welcomed the news , but warned that several ‘ innovative , effective drugs ’ are still ‘ sitting on the shelf of no use to anybody ’ .			0
