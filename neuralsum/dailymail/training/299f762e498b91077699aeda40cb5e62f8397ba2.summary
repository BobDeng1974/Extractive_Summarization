@entity0 , a sought - after wood - carving artist , said he spent 10 hours every day since the government shutdown began , cleaning up the @entity3 -- until the @entity4 made him stop a kind - hearted @entity6 volunteer who has mowed lawns , cleared a fallen tree and emptied ' hundreds of trash cans ' up and down the @entity3 since the federal government partially shut down told @entity11 that an aggressive , ' bully ' of a @entity14 park police officer who ' looked like @entity15 ' today ordered him to leave the @entity16			1
@entity0 , the one - man landscaping crew , calls himself the @entity17			1
he said he has been on a mission to spruce up the lawns , trees and trash bins near @entity14 's grandest memorials before the weekend , because a ' million vet march ' event is expected to bring scores of retired servicemen and women to the nation 's capital			1
@entity14 @entity30 employees have been furloughed by the thousands since oct. 1 , when a budget battle between the @entity32 and congressional @entity33 forced a partial shutdown of federal agencies			1
even though the feds told him he 's not welcome , @entity0 says his message has n't changed			1
' i 'm calling on @entity14 , ' the 45 - year - old told @entity11 : ' find a memorial			1
instead of bringing a picnic basket , show up with a lawn mower and a rake			2
' @entity0 said he 's not a veteran himself , but his grandfather served in the @entity49 , his roommate was awarded multiple purple heart citations , and his stepfather is a 1959 @entity52 graduate			1
' and his brother 's name is listed on the @entity55 , ' @entity0 said			1
' in my mind , that entitled me to pick up as much trash as i wanted to			2
but when he tried to mow a lawn , the @entity70 threw him out @entity0 said a single park police officer overruled his kinder , gentler comrades on wednesday , and told him to ' get your stuff and get out of here			1
' ' i had a great experience there for the most part , ' he recalled , saying the police ' knew who i was by the second day – they had my social security number somehow ! and they all welcomed me			2
nobody said anything to me for the next 6 or 7 days			0
i thought they were on my side because they saw what i did for them			0
' ' then this one cop , a big ... guy , he had me scared , and i 'm six - foot - two and 225 pounds			0
i do n't get intimidated easily			2
i mean , i had a chainsaw			0
but he was being a bully			2
' he said he told the officer that it broke his heart to see newspaper photos showing the @entity3 in disrepair after the shutdown began			1
' i 'm not here trying to make headlines , ' he recalled saying			0
' i 'm here trying to prevent headlines			0
' ' he says to me , " well , maybe there should be a picture of the trash cans overflowing in the newspaper			2
maybe that would help us			0
" ' ' i disagree , ' @entity0 told @entity11			1
' do you want all the veterans coming here and tripping over banana peels , and dirty diapers , and everything ? ' ' these are our memorials , ' @entity0 told @entity123 in @entity124 earlier in the day			1
' do they think that we ’re just going to let them go to hell ? ' ' no , if they shut down our memorials , we 're still going to take the trash out , we 're going to clean the windows , we 're going to cut the grass , we 're going to pull the weeds , we 're going to do the tree work			1
' @entity0 ( @entity134 ) is known for his wood carvings , which he sells out of a roadside garden center in suburban @entity137 @entity0 , 45 , said while most of the @entity4 officers he has encountered in the last week appreciated his efforts , one told him wednesday that he had no right to empty trash cans near the @entity55 , @entity16 and @entity144 memorials ' the day of the shutdown – i 'm watching the news a week ago , and they 're talking about how vulnerable the memorials are , ' he told @entity11			1
' so right after the news i threw my bicycle into my truck and i patrolled the memorials all night long			2
anyone could just come up there and spray paint or whatever			0
' ' i realized that i could serve my country better as a custodian , ' he concluded			0
@entity0 also brought a giant @entity6 flag , which he carried over his shoulder while he worked			2
' the trash cans were overflowing			2
i emptied hundreds of trash cans on the @entity3			1
i grabbed a leaf blower and blew the leaves off the lawn near the memorials			2
today i showed up and a giant tree had fallen over			0
i took my chainsaw and cut it up and hauled it away			0
' later , he said , ' they let me mow the lawn for an hour or so			0
' and then the police showed up			0
two officers , @entity0 said , ' were high - fiving me			2
they knew i had spent 10 hours a day out there emptying trash , and i think they admired that			0
; but the third , he recalled , rebuffed his handshake , saying ' i do n't shake hands			0
... you need to get that lawnmower out of here			0
' that officer later told him that he was ' not allowed to pick up trash			1
that 's not your job , ' said @entity0			1
@entity0 said his tree surgery and lawn mowing was just the icing on the cake : he 's been emptying ' hundreds of trash cans ' all week and beautifying the @entity3 for an upcoming veterans ' march ' find a memorial , ' @entity0 advises @entity14 disillusioned by the government shutdown			1
instead of bringing a picnic basket , show up with a lawn mower and a rake			0
' park police public information officer sergeant @entity206 said @entity0 was n't arrested			1
' he was asked to leave , and he complied , ' @entity206 said			0
but ' i could n't believe it was happening , ' @entity0 told @entity11			1
' they changed the reason later , saying it was because i had a gas can and the other guy lit himself on fire			0
' last week a man saluted the @entity14 @entity215 before sitting down on the @entity3 , pouring gasoline over his own head and killing himself with a lighter			1
' and i was like , " do you think i 'm going to mow the lawn first , and then kill myself ? " ' give him a medal , ' quipped one reader on @entity223 , after the story first broke on @entity225 and @entity226			0
' the medal - givers are all on furlough , ' replied a second			0
' i 'm surprised he was n't taken down by a seal team , ' another chimed in			0
the government 's partial shutdown has put hundreds of thousands of federal employees on unpaid vacations , including tens of thousands attached to the @entity236 , which runs the @entity3 memorials on the @entity3 have officially been closed for eight days , along with all 401 @entity238 and countless other public sites .			1
