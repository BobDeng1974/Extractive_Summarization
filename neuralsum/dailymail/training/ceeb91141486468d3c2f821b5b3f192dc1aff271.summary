a small remote town where @entity1 is banned has become an unlikely haven for people claiming modern technology has been making them ill. the so - called ' @entity1 refugees ' are flocking to the tiny settlement to escape painful symptoms including burning skin , chest pains and acute headaches			1
the sufferers argue the affliction - a condition known as @entity14 - has been eased by the move and report feeling much better			2
behind the times : dozens of @entity18 have relocated to the small town of @entity20 , @entity21 in hopes of escaping electromagnetic signals @entity20 is in the middle of the @entity25 which was established to provide optimum conditions for telescopes refugee : @entity29 moved to @entity20 from @entity30 when she started noticing pain whenever she was near a cell phone or device with @entity1 many have relocated to @entity20 , @entity21 , from across @entity18 to avoid mobile phones , @entity1 hotspots , tv and radio transmissions			1

here , mobile phones , radio and tv transmitters and @entity1 are forbidden to prevent interference with one of the world 's largest radio telescopes			1
the @entity70 telescope is the world 's largest fully steerable radio telescope			1
nearly 4 per cent of the @entity74 and @entity18 population could be affected by @entity14 , estimates reveal			1
but despite nearly 30 studies being carried out into the phenomena , @entity57 is currently the only country to recognise it as a medical condition			1

@entity20 , @entity21 is situated in the middle of the @entity25
all electromagnetic signals are banned within the zone including wifi and cellphones
the zone was set up to *protect* the world 's largest radio telescopes from electronic interference
@entity18 from across the country have resettled in @entity20 to get away from the signals , which they find *physically* *damaging*
more than 30 people have relocated to @entity20 as of 2013
