scandal : @entity1 discovered his father was actually his uncle , the archbishop of one of @entity5 's biggest ' mega-churches ' , when he was 34 a mega-church pastor who discovered at the age of 34 that his @entity8 uncle was actually his father has revealed how he found peace : by founding a ' radically inclusive ' church that recognises @entity11 as well as @entity12			1
@entity1 , 42 , was brought up in the @entity13 at @entity14			1
once the fourth biggest ' mega-church ' in the @entity5 , it occupied a purpose - built , $ 12million building with 7,000 seats , and boasted 12,000 members at its peak in the early nineties			1
but a series of sex scandals and financial difficulties brought the church established by @entity1 's parents and uncle to its knees			1
speaking to @entity30 , @entity1 has revealed how it was the family 's ultimate scandal - the fact his @entity8 uncle was his biological father - which finally gave him the strength to create a church based around his own beliefs			1
the @entity37 , which @entity38 founded in 2012 , welcomes everyone from @entity40 to atheists , @entity42 to @entity43 , recognising all gods and prophets , including @entity11			0
' [ @entity0 ] has a way of wiping out the things that keep you from being authentic , ' he said			0
' all you have left is who you are			0
the games are gone ... if there was anything i wanted to say i thought would be unacceptable to the church , now is the time to say it			0
' after much soul searching , @entity1 established his church based around one principle : ' @entity12 can not be , and will not be , restricted to @entity60 '			2
he preaches a message of inclusion , and tells his congregation ' the truth ' is not limited to the @entity65 , but can be found in all creation - even other religions			2
this message has been controversial , however , and many of his former followers have abandoned him			0
the two brothers set up the @entity13 at @entity14 with @entity74 's wife @entity77 in 1960 , creating one of the first churches to welcome people of all colours heir : @entity38 , the family 's only son , pictured leading a service , was always intended to take over the church , but became disillusioned with the institution when he discovered the truth about his parentage it is likely this particular philosophy would have horrified his uncle , a tyrannical figure who led the @entity13 from its inception in 1960			1
set up with his brother @entity74 and his wife @entity77 , @entity96 was one of the first churches to accept both @entity101 and whites worshipping together , and at one point was attracting 100 new members a week			0
it would grow to be the fourth largest church in @entity5 , recognised by then - president @entity107 for its volunteering work in 1982			2
by 1991 , the church had 12,000 members , and a cathedral with a 245 - foot steeple			1
its pastors had acted like minor celebrities , travelling by private jet , charging as much as $ 7,500 per appearance and collecting their own ' groupies ' , who would reportedly get them dressed and even wipe the sweat from their faces			0
and @entity1 , as the only boy born to either of the brothers , was set to inherit it all - a fact which had been impressed on him from the age of nine			2
fall from grace : the church , which grew to 12,000 members , was rocked by a series of sex scandals in the early nineties , causing many of its members to lose their faith secrets : @entity73 would also turn out to be @entity1 's father - a fact the tyranical pastor would continue to deny but the church began to implode : @entity73 - now ' archbishop @entity73 ' - was implicated in a series of sex scandals , some of which were settled out of court			1
the archbishop was also accused of slurring a congregant as a lesbian , threatening another with a .38 gun , and pretending never to watch television while hiding one in his cupboard			0
he could be so ruthless that his secretary , @entity153 , @entity1 's sister , would often leave his office crying			0
then , in 2007 , it was revealed @entity1 's father was not @entity74 , 76 , but @entity73			2
@entity77 , who had tried to hide her secret for more than three decades , claimed that ' it was no more than insemination '			0
nonetheless , this would mark a turning point for @entity38 pain : after @entity73 's death in 2009 , @entity165 through a great deal of soul - searching and decided to open his own church that recognised all faiths @entity73 died in 2009 aged 81 , and @entity1 sold the cathedral for $ 17.5million shortly afterwards			1
three years later , @entity1 opened a new , ' radically inclusive ' church , which bills itself as ' the trendiest , friendliest , most radically inclusive worshipping experience in @entity173 '			1
but it horrified many of @entity1 's conservative @entity60 followers			0
@entity1 told @entity30 : ' they can tolerate all the sexual scandals and the lawsuits , but when you invite a @entity43 or a gay person to church , that 's the scandal you leave for ? ' the church , which has 700 members , is going from strength to strength .			2

@entity1 , 42 , runs a controversial church where all religions are equal
this is his way of dealing with the pain of learning at the age of 34 that his charismatic , @entity8 uncle was really his biological father
he grew up in the notorious @entity13 at @entity14 in @entity173 , which was famous for its riches and sex scandals
the 7,000 - seat church had 12,000 members in the early nineties , but a series of abuse *allegations* caused it to fall from grace
