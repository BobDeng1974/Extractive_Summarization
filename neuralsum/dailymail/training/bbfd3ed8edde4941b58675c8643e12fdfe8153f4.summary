@entity0 has an estimated 15.4 billion barrels of crude oil beneath its fertile farmland - and now companies are scrambling to get their hands on it , putting the lush landscape in danger			1
while the ' @entity9 ' has long been believed to be under 1,750 square miles of central and southern @entity0 , technology is finally able to extract it , potentially sparking a huge oil boom			1
but the oil could also prove a massive area of conflict between the oil companies and the state 's powerful environmental interests , as campaigners protest against the use of fracking to extract it			1
there are also fears that the fertile landscape will be taken over by looming drills and oil sites , pushing out vineyards , endangering rare species and flattening the rolling hills			2
reserve : the @entity9 is believed to be under 1,750 sq miles of central and southern @entity0 but amid the concerns , companies are staking their claim on the shale , quietly buying up mineral rights and carrying out tests across the state - all behind a veil of secrecy			1
if companies can extract it , it will turn the state from the third biggest producer of oil to the first - as the @entity9 has four times as much oil as @entity45 , currently the biggest producer			1
companies have be unable to reach the oil before now because tectonic activity folded the rock and pushed oil into layered pockets that are expensive to reach			1
the oil is also 6,000 to 15,000 feet beneath the surface , while in other areas , like @entity53 in @entity0 , companies need only drill up to 2,000 feet			1
fertile : the vineyards of @entity56 near @entity57 , where a battle for mineral rights is underway			1
the area is home to several endangered species - but also one of the largest deposits of shale oil in the country bleak future : companies are buying up mineral rights to public land and carrying out test drills in december , @entity73 predicted that the @entity74 will become an oil exporter by 2025 , due to an increase in production and energy efficiencies			1
@entity45 is the top producer of crude oil and its on the increase ; in september , the state 's crude - oil production reached two million barrels per day , while production in 2011 was 1.5 million barrels per day			2
@entity86 produced 728,000 barrels of oil a day in september , according to the @entity88			2
@entity0 takes the third place for production , with 524,000 barrels of oil a day in september			1
despite this central role in oil production , it has some of the highest gas prices in the nation			2
@entity95 is the fourth largest producer , with 502,000 barrels a day in september , and @entity97 produced 250,000 barrels , putting it in fifth place , according to the @entity88			0
source : @entity101 but technological advances have now made extracting the @entity9 more likely , the @entity103 reported , and old and new companies are swooping in to stake a claim			2
mineral rights to public lands are being sold by the @entity108 and plots have soared from $ 2 an acre to more than a thousand dollars each			1
the successful bidders have 10 years to develop a working oil well on the land or the lease expires , @entity111 explained			2
the government receives 12.5 per cent of revenues from the oil			2
' it 's good for us , ' @entity119 , an assistant field officer for the @entity108 , told @entity111			0
' last year we brought in $ 190 million			0
' companies have begun drilling holes northwest of @entity124 to see if they hit the jackpot , keeping quiet about what , when and how they 're exploring - as well as what they find			0
' our companies are not forthcoming on their business plans , ' said @entity132 from the @entity133 , which represents companies including @entity135 and @entity136			0
' these are pretty smart people , they 're pretty good at what they do			0
they 're pretty competitive out there			0
' and while little has been revealed about the success of the searches , still they continue			0
destruction : a gas flare burns at a fracking site in rural @entity147 , @entity148 ' there are billions of barrels of oil buried in the @entity9 , and as far as i know , nobody 's been able to find it yet , ' @entity149 , the president of @entity150 , told the @entity103			2
' but i think there 's going to be more people looking for it			0
you ca n't let a few dry holes discourage the whole thing , because if you find oil , you make money			0
' but as well as exciting oilmen , the @entity9 has also sprung environmentalists into action			0
to extract the oil , companies would use hydraulic fracturing , or fracking , which is the drilling technique used in booms elsewhere - but campaigners deem unsafe for the environment			1
the geological formation means the fracking will also have to be more intensive in the area , which is dangerous because of the various tectonic plates beneath @entity0 , environmentalists say			1
anger : protestors hold signs against fracking - the method by which the oil is extracted - during a demo outside of the @entity186 in @entity187 last year while there is currently no legislation against fracking in @entity0 , the @entity188 released a draft of fracking rules , starting the process to set regulations			1
but not every large company is getting involved with the process ; @entity198 has drilled into the area but has ' not been encouraged by the results ' , it told @entity111 in a statement			0
others are n't giving up just yet			0
' i do n't really know what the break point is for the companies , ' @entity204 , from the petroleum association , added			0
' that 's what our members are trying to figure out right now			0

oil is under 1,750 square miles of central and southern @entity0
the oil , which is deeper beneath the surface than other reserves and hidden in pockets , can finally be reached thanks to developed technology
companies are quietly buying up mineral rights to the public land
but it is also *galvanising* environmentalists who are fighting against the use of ' fracking ' to extract the oil and fear damage to the fertile land
