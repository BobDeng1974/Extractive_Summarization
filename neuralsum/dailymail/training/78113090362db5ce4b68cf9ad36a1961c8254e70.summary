the @entity1 ’s new car tax regime descended into chaos on its first day as both its website and telephone line crashed			1
paper tax discs were scrapped after 93 years yesterday in favour of an online system , causing the payment website to buckle under the weight of inquiries			1
it is thought that tens of thousands of people mistakenly believed they could no longer pay the tax at their local post office and tried to use the @entity1 ’s website instead , leading to a surge in users			2
both were also out of service for 12 hours from tuesday evening into wednesday morning for maintenance , which added to the problems			0
some 3.8million vehicles were due to have their tax renewed at the beginning of october			2
a @entity1 source confirmed that its system was overwhelmed , adding : ‘ we have seen the highest single day online volumes as more people continue to move to our online service and away from the post office			1
’ the organisation issued a string of apologies on its official @entity23 feed , posting on tuesday evening : ‘ if you are using our online car tax service tonight please keep trying			2
unprecedented demand is causing slow responses – sorry about that			1
’ but many angry drivers also took to social media to vent their frustration			0
some complained that it took up to four hours to complete a process that should take a matter of minutes , while others said they simply could not pay their tax at all and were worried about being fined			0
another @entity1 tweet advised drivers to ring its customer service line , which costs up to 40p a minute from a mobile phone			1
but on calling , many people were simply faced with a recorded message telling them to ring back later due to the high volume of inquiries			0
in a report to the commons transport select committee earlier this year , the @entity69 warned that the @entity1 ’s computer systems may not be capable of handling the new regime			2
yesterday @entity69 president @entity74 said : ‘ it ’s a bit ironic in this digital age that the site goes down on the first day of the electronic system coming into being			2
‘ i think that not only a lot of people have tried to get on to the site to renew their car tax , but also a number have tried to access the site to find out how the changes to the car tax system affect them			0
’ now paper discs have been scrapped , police and traffic wardens will use cameras or handheld computers linked to the @entity1 ’s database , and be automatically alerted if an untaxed car is on the road			1
the government claims the new system will be more efficient and cheaper to run			0
however , critics have suggested that without the need to display a disc , the number of motorists failing to pay their car tax could soar as high as the number who drive without insurance			0
the payment website and phone line were up and running again by 5pm yesterday			0
last night , the @entity1 apologised for the problems and suggested its telecoms provider , @entity110 , may have been responsible			2
a @entity1 spokesman said : ‘ @entity110 ’s engineers worked hard with us to resolve the issue as quickly as possible			0
‘ @entity110 will continue to monitor the service closely and will be carrying out a full investigation			0
’ the screen that several motorists have faced when trying to apply for new road tax since @entity1 system failed vehicle tax was introduced in the 1888 budget			1
the @entity123 required councils to ' register all new vehicles and to allocate a separate number to each vehicle ' and ' make provision for the collection and application of the excise duties on mechanically propelled vehicles and on carriages '			0
and so the requirement to display a tax disc was introduced in 1921			0
more than 1.7billion tax discs have been issued since then and if they were put in a line , they would go around the world three times			1
last year , the @entity1 issued 42.2million tax discs weighing more than 72 tonnes			1
from october 1 , 2014 motorists were no longer required to display the paper disc in the windows and a new digital system relying on road traffic cameras was introduced			1
motorists will still have to pay tax on their vehicles , but will no longer have to display a disc in their windscreen the paper discs were in use for 93 years but have been scrapped in a scheme set to save £ 20million a year			1

drivers told to scrap paper tax discs , which have been in use for *century*
but *replacement* digital system crashed after ' unprecedented demand '
@entity1 received *250,000* applications online last night and phone lines closed
motorists also warned *faulty* cameras could see drivers **wrongly** fined
figures show up to *1.2million* vehicles are **wrongly** *identified* every day
