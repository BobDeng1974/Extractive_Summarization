mother of ex-navy seal says @entity3 presidential nominee @entity2 is exploiting her son 's death on the campaign trail by @entity7 published : 14:16 est , 10 october 2012 updated : 20:34 est , 10 october 2012 @entity2 ’s campaign has said he will stop talking about his meeting with a former @entity10 killed in last month ’s terror attack on the @entity13 consulate in @entity14 after the victim ’s mother protested his use of her son ’s death			1
@entity20 , the mother of 42 - year - old @entity21 , who was killed alongside the @entity13 ambassador @entity22 and three others last month , said : ' i do n’t trust @entity2			1
he should n’t make my son ’s death part of his political agenda			1
’ ‘ it ’s wrong to use these brave young men , who wanted freedom for all , to degrade @entity32 , ' she added			2
‘ gov. @entity2 was inspired by the memory of meeting @entity21 and shared his story and that memory , but we respect the wishes of mrs @entity20 , ’ said @entity2 campaign spokeswoman @entity46			1
until this week , @entity2 had n't mentioned @entity20 's name on the campaign trail			1
but in recent days , @entity2 revealed on several occasions while campaigning that he had met @entity20 several years ago near his home in @entity56 , @entity57			1
reflection : @entity2 remembers meeting @entity21 at a holiday party near his home in @entity56 , @entity57 killed : @entity20 was one of four @entity13 killed in last month 's attacks against the @entity13 consulate in @entity62 ' he came from @entity63 , where i ’d been governor , had family there , ' @entity2 told factory workers in @entity67 , @entity68			1
' he also had skied in some of the places that i had found during the @entity71 in @entity72			2
and we had a nice chat together			0
' he told the crowd that @entity20 was working in @entity62 as a private security contractor when he was killed			2
' and you can imagine how shocked i was to learn that he was one of the two @entity10 — former @entity80 killed in @entity62 , just a couple of weeks ago , ' @entity2 said			1
' and i read on @entity82 that when the report came that our consulate had been attacked , that he and the other seal that was killed with him , that they were in a different place , they were about a mile away , an annex somewhere else in the city			1
' and when they heard that the consulate was under attack , they went to the attack			0
they did n’t hunker down and hide themselves			0
no , they went there			0
that ’s what @entity13 do			0
when there ’s a challenge , when there ’s a threat , we go there			0
when things are tough , we do n’t give up , we keep fighting			0
there ’s a saying that i ’ve found pretty compelling			0
@entity115 eyes , full heart , ca n’t lose			0
' wreckage : @entity20 exemplified the unwavering courage of @entity13 troops when he rushed to the site of the attack in @entity62 , @entity2 says one of @entity21 's best friends says the former @entity10 remembered his meeting with @entity2 much differently than the way @entity2 described			1
@entity124 , who said he has been friends with @entity20 for more than two decades , told @entity126 that @entity2 unknowingly reintroduced himself to his friend several times throughout the evening			1
' he said it was very comical , ' @entity124 said			0
' @entity2 approached him ultimately four times , using this private gathering as a political venture to further his image			2
he kept introducing himself as @entity2 , a political figure			2
the same introduction , the same opening line			0
@entity137 believed it to be very insincere and stale			0
