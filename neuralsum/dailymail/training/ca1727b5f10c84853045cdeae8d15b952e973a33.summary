@entity0 has removed headless exhibits like this one from this year 's @entity3 line - up theme parks @entity0 had to remove headless props from their @entity3 attractions after complaints that the decapitated heads on display reminded them of the beheadings by terrorist group @entity10			1
the change came in the wake of the beheadings of @entity16 journalists @entity14 and @entity17 , and @entity19 aid worker @entity18			1
islamic state militants recently released three videos showing each of the brutal acts			2
spokesmen for @entity0 in @entity24 and @entity25 said that in light of the events , some props may have had the unintended consequence of appearing insensitive and wo n't be part of this year 's @entity32 attraction			1
' many of the scenes depicted at @entity0 ' @entity32 are graphic in nature , but they are fictional and are not intended to provide commentary on current world events , ' spokesman @entity33 wrote			1
' the props in this year 's event were designed and purchased several months ago			1
' complaints cropped up recently in @entity42 when the @entity44 newspaper ran a photo of five severed head props that were part of the attraction			2
the props were part of the @entity50 attraction , which showed a pirate - themed haunted house with body parts and heads			2
' within this macabre market , the pirates have been slaughtered and mutiny is afoot , ' the description on the website reads			2
' the way out lies with the buried treasure and the blood - curdling screams you hear just might be your own			2
' decorations like this one at @entity0 has drawn criticism from some parkgoers who say it 's too gruesome in light of the latest @entity10 beheadings the removed props were a part of the park 's yearly @entity32 attraction the attraction rubbed some parkgoers the wrong way			1
' that ’s not … consistent with the @entity3 spirit at all , ' parkgoe @entity76 told @entity79			1
' i think it was good that they pulled it			0
it was out of order and insensitive to public sentiment			0
so , i ’m glad they responded			0
' some , like patron @entity88 , disagreed			0
i would not associate one with the other , you know ? ' he told @entity79			0
' that ’s how i feel about it			0
people go there for the scariness , and what ’s happening in the @entity99 is entirely different			0
' the @entity44 reported that it ran a front page photo of the severed head props saturday , three hours after media outlets began reporting that the terrorist group @entity104 had posted a new video claiming to have beheaded @entity18 , a @entity19 aid worker			1
gazette editor @entity106 defended running the photos , according to a story on the paper 's website			0
' the photo was taken last week as part of an assignment to preview a current exhibit , ' he said			0
' the figures are cartoonish in design , and do not look realistic			0
it is the job of our reporters and photographers to report and photograph the news , not censor it			0
' @entity42 's @entity3 - themed attraction opened in mid-september			1
the @entity25 park 's attraction opens sept. 26 .			1

@entity0 in @entity24 and @entity25 will no *longer* show headless props this @entity3
some parkgoers were *miffed* at the displays because they reminded them of the recent beheadings by the @entity104 terrorist group
