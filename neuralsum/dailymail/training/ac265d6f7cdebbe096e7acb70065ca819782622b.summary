by @entity0 a pharmaceutical company has announced that they will cease production of a prescription cough syrup due to its association with drug sizzurp			1
@entity6 , also known as ‘ purple drank ’ , is made from prescription cough syrup , hard candy and sugary soft drinks , and is popular among rap stars and pop prince - turned - wannabe gangster @entity13			1
@entity15 say that it is the celebrity glorification of using their ‘ @entity21 with @entity24 cough syrup ’ to make sizzurp that has led to the company stopping all production and sales			1
these include rapper @entity37 , who frequently posts images of @entity15 ’ bottles on his @entity36 , and according to sources , also teen idol @entity13			1
‘ given [ recent media attention ] , @entity15 has made the bold and unprecedented decision to cease all production and sales of its @entity54 product , ’ a representative told @entity48			1
‘ this attention has glamorized the unlawful and dangerous use of the product , which is contrary to its approved indication			0
’ @entity6 originated in @entity59 in the 1960s and has since spread via urban music communities in the southern states to mainstream teenagers via modern glorification of the drug on social media and in lyrics and music videos			0
mysterious cup : @entity13 was seen drinking out of a type of @entity71 associated with making sizzurp during his birthday celebrations in march @entity74 drank : pop star - cum - career car wreck @entity13 and rapper @entity76 , who suffered seizures last year after a codeine overdose , are both said to be big fans of sizzurp clever boy : @entity37 often posts photos on @entity36 which includes a bottle of the @entity15 prescription cough syrup it is made by mixing codeine cough syrup , its colour gives the right hue to the drink , and soda , most often sprite or @entity90 , and @entity92 candy for extra sweetness			1
the drinker experiences an immediate , euphoric high as well as drowsiness and lethargy , and sometimes also hallucinations			0
the amount of cough syrup in each serving of sizzurp can see a drinker consume 25 times the recommended dose of codeine and promethazine			1
in 2013 , rapper @entity76 , a known sizzurp fan who even wrote song me and my drank about the drug , collapsed and suffered multiple seizures			0
the four - time @entity112 - winning rapper was rushed to @entity114 ’s @entity113 where doctors allegedly found high amounts of codeine in his system			0

danger : prescription cough syrup from @entity15 , now discontinued although it is prominent in rap culture in particular , sizzurp has long been popular among teenagers of all backgrounds as a cheap way to get high			1
according to the @entity160 , one in ten @entity159 teenagers use cough syrup or cold medicine as a recreational drug			2
the high - sugar content and mouthfeel of the syrup , as well as the codeine , makes it a very addictive substance			2
the sweet taste also means that many do not realise the danger of sizzurp , nor how much they have had			0
just one serving can contain 25 times the recommended daily dose of cough syrup			2
' this is a very dangerous drug , it can lead to seizures and essentially lead you to stop breathing , ’ dr. @entity177 of @entity178 in @entity179 told @entity184			0
