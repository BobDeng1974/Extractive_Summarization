@entity0 will watch on anxiously this week as @entity2 ’s stars enter an eight - week passage of the season which players ’ union chiefs argue will be more physically and emotionally demanding than the @entity7 itself			1
@entity10 ’s latest bout of knee surgery is the more recent blow and , with the @entity13 ( @entity14 ) kicking off on friday , when @entity15 face @entity16 , and with @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 all in action on back - to - back weekends ahead of a four - test international series against the @entity24 and co , @entity0 faces an anxious fortnight			1
@entity20 and @entity2 flanker @entity10 , 28 , had surgery on thursday to remove a screw in his knee and is the ninth potential member of @entity32 ’s @entity31 for the @entity34 internationals to be ruled out through injury			1
@entity10 has had surgery on his knee and could be the ninth player to be sidelined from @entity2 's squad @entity2 head coach @entity0 will be watching nervously as stars enter an intense eight - week period with a further two @entity14 matches following clashes with @entity24 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 , there is growing concern demands on members of @entity2 ’s @entity31 — to be announced on october 22 — are too great			1
‘ the way the game is evolving , it is only getting more physical and more intense , more competitive , more running , more everything , ’ said @entity2 and @entity19 prop @entity49 , before he suffered a shoulder injury that meant another lengthy spell on the sidelines			1
‘ the number of games we play is definitely something that could be looked at , especially those guys who you want to go and play however many internationals a year			0
‘ you have to be careful what you say as well as a player			0
you sign the deals in the @entity67 to play the amount of games you play			0
but going forward , bigger picture , long term , there is definitely room to at least look at that topic			0
’ @entity49 ( r ) has suffered a shoulder injury after complaining the game is getting too physical @entity77 chief executive @entity76 speaks with @entity0 at @entity78 in 2012 @entity79 ( neck ) @entity81 ( neck ) @entity49 ( shoulder ) @entity84 ( shoulder ) @entity86 ( quad ) @entity88 ( concussion ) @entity10 ( knee ) @entity91 ( groin ) @entity77 chief executive @entity76 is expected to meet with his premier @entity95 counterpart , @entity94 , in the coming days to start negotiations over the next heads - of - agreement between clubs and country , with the current deal concluding in 2016			1
the @entity102 , the body charged with representing the player ’s interests , will not play a direct part but chief executive @entity107 has been given assurances that player ’s concerns will be heeded			1
‘ it ’s a treadmill that we put players on , especially at the top end , ’ said @entity107			1
‘ the players who are the best in their field at club and international level are expected to deliver week in , week out			1
having said that , the support these players get now has never been better and clubs would be mad to burn out key people			2
do i think there is a crisis ? no. overall we are in a healthy place as a sport			0
but as a union we believe four weeks should be a minimum rest period for all players between seasons			2
former @entity2 internationals @entity132 and @entity134 ( r ) have been forced to retire ‘ we ’re all excited about the new @entity136 fixtures and what they will deliver			2
but you need to look at having two @entity136 games followed by four autumn internationals — three against the best teams in the world — then two at the other end of it			0
it ’s probably more demanding than a @entity7 in terms of pressure put on players			1
’ with multi-million tv revenues central to the sport ’s survival , it is almost impossible to see a future where less rugby is played			0
but there are clearly consequences as a result of the ‘ bigger , stronger , faster ’ culture			0
an investigation by @entity163 last season , in conjunction with the @entity102 , found that 28 professional players retired through injury during the season ; an increase of almost 80 per cent over five years			0
it is unclear if that figure will be reduced this year but early signs are not promising			0
former @entity2 internationals @entity132 ( ankle ) and @entity134 ( shoulder ) have been forced to retire prematurely this season through injury			2
@entity177 international @entity176 has said that he expects to suffer from arthritis by the time he reaches 40 last week , @entity177 international @entity176 admitted he is ‘ ready for arthritis when i ’m 40 ’ as a result of the collisions he has experienced playing rugby			2
the @entity184 recently signed a deal with the @entity187 regions which will see dual - contracted players limited to only 16 non-international matches a season			2
many believe a similar deal should be struck in @entity2			2
‘ we simply have no idea what sort of physical condition these players are going to be in in 10 , 15 , 20 years ’ time , ’ said dr @entity193 , who retired from the @entity195 ’s medical advisory panel in 2011 in protest at the way rugby treated concussion			0
‘ we are seeing significant health issues with my generation [ from the @entity207 ] of players which are clearly linked to playing rugby but we were not playing the same game the boys are playing today			0
you simply can not compare the ferocious level of physicality we see week - in - week - out in the professional game			1
’ @entity15 boss @entity216 , who received heavy criticism last season for giving his @entity2 players one week off following the @entity220 , but its widely viewed as one of the most progressive directors of rugby , said : ‘ the game is more physical than i can ever remember			1
the issue of rest periods needs to be addressed			0
