impressive : the stone art work - which is decorated on both sides and has been described as one of the ' finest ever ' to be found in @entity7 - was uncovered last night on the @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 ancient : the other side of the stone , whch was found at the base of the south - west internal corner of the @entity3 ' cathedral ' at the site , which covers 2.5 hectares and is believed to have been occupied from @entity26 @entity3 man built a vast temple complex at the @entity8 , with some parts constructed more than 5,000 years ago , even before the @entity30 had started building the pyramids			1
excavations began in 2003 at the site , which has provided evidence of housing , decorated stone slabs , a massive stone wall with foundations , and a large building described as a @entity3 cathedral			2
once protected by two giant walls , each more than 330ft long and 13ft high , the complex at the @entity8 contained more than a dozen large temples , with one measuring almost 270 sq ft. they were linked to outhouses and kitchens by carefully constructed stone pavements			1
the bones of sacrificed cattle , elegantly made pottery and pieces of painted ceramics lie scattered there			2
excavation : @entity3 man built a vast temple complex at the @entity8 , with some parts constructed more than 5,000 years ago , even before the @entity30 had started building the pyramids digging : excavations began in 2003 at the site , which has provided evidence of housing , decorated stone slabs , a massive stone wall with foundations , and a large building described as a @entity3 cathedral but the exact purpose of the complex is a mystery			1
the stone has been described as better than previous examples of @entity3 artwork found at @entity73 and @entity74 in the 1970s and 1980s			0
the people of the @entity3 , the new @entity76 , were the first farmers in @entity7 , and they arrived on @entity9 about 6,000 years ago			1
they cultivated the land , built farmsteads and rapidly established a vibrant culture , erecting giant stone circles , chambered communal tombs , and a giant complex of buildings			0

in gatherings equivalent to the @entity90 , the men of the age would spend several days eating , drinking and dancing			0
herds of cattle were slaughtered to provide food and dancing would continue late into the night during the summer months			1
an online diary kept by archeologists at the site said today : ‘ [ this is ] perhaps the finest piece of art we have recovered from the site , and one of the finest from the @entity7 ever , amazing and awe inspiring			0
‘ as we slowed to draw breath at the beauty of the revealed panel , a cry went up that an equally impressive design was apparent on one of the other sides of this large triangular block of stone			0
‘ although the basis of the designs of interconnecting triangles can be loosely paralleled on a slab discovered at @entity73 in the 1970s , a lightly inscribed stone in @entity74 discovered by @entity119 in the 1980s and some @entity121 art. ' this is a much finer and more complex piece of art. ‘ many of the triangles are filled with cross-hatching and other designs			0
an initial wash has also revealed a finely incised chevron design and small cup marks			0
