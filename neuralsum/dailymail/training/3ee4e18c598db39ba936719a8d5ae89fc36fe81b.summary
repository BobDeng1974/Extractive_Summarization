report today criticised @entity1 health chiefs by @entity3 published : 13:30 est , 28 may 2013 updated : 14:51 est , 28 may 2013 killed : mental health worker @entity4 , 22 , was savagely stabbed to death by paranoid schizophrenic @entity6			1
a report today said she should not have visited him alone a mental health worker killed after being savagely stabbed 39 times by a paranoid schizophrenic in his own home should not have visited him alone , a damning report has concluded			1
@entity6 broke three knives during the frenzied attack on 22 - year - old graduate @entity4 after she had gone to his home in @entity18 to deliver a letter telling him he was in debt			1
an investigation into the circumstances surrounding her death has today heavily criticised health chiefs from @entity25 and said that @entity6 should not have been managed in the community			1
@entity6 , described in the report as a loner , had a history of mental illness and had previously attacked his parents with a hammer while they were in bed			1
the report , commissioned by the @entity35 , outlined how by 2006 when the stabbing took place , he was in relapse and had disengaged from services			0
but in spite of this , on may 19 , 2006 , psychology graduate ms @entity4 , who worked for housing support charity @entity42 , was sent by herself to his home with a letter telling him he was in debt			1
within 15 minutes of her walking through the door a neighbour heard screams and shouts of ' get off ’ and ' stop it '			1
a minute - long ' hysterical screech ' was then heard , before @entity6 changed his bloodied clothes , showered and with his dogs walked to a police station and said he had murdered someone			1
the report said : ' it is the view of the panel that if a robust risk assessment had been completed including a consideration of the lone working policy with @entity64 [ @entity6 ] , such lone working would have been abandoned and joint visits implemented			2
' thus , it must follow , that @entity67 [ @entity68 ] would not have been attending @entity64 ’s [ @entity6 ’s ] house on her own on 19 may 2006			2
' brutal : @entity6 , left , stabbed @entity4 , right , 39 times and broke three knives during the attack after she had gone to his home to deliver a letter from her employers it describes the letter she had with her as ' provocative ' and said that it was ' entirely inappropriate ' for her to have delivered it to him			1
it also says there was ' a misplaced but substantial over reliance upon @entity42 ’ staff ' by clinicians from the @entity87			0
it says : ' the reliance on @entity42 staff to report on p [ @entity6 ] led to a situation where @entity64 ’s mental state was never properly established or assessed on a regular basis			2
' it was , in our view , wholly inappropriate to rely upon @entity42 as the conduit for reporting on @entity64 ’s [ @entity6 ’s ] mental state and clinical signs			2
' while the panel found that ' it is impossible to conclude with absolute certainty that the vicious attack could have been predicted or avoided ' , they do say he should have previously been detained under the @entity106			0
horrific : @entity6 killed the 22 - year - old in may 2006 when she attended his home in @entity109 , @entity18 , pictured , for a support visit , as part of her work for the charity @entity42 they also conclude that throughout the period in question a ' light approach ' had been taken towards @entity6 ’s care , but his condition ' demanded a more robust intervention '			1
in october 2007 @entity6 pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and was ordered to be detained indefinitely in a secure psychiatric unit			0
@entity42 have also previously admitted health and safety breaches and been fined £ 30,000			0
a statement by the @entity87 said : ' we welcome the publication of this report , we accept its findings and we apologise for the shortcomings identified in it			0
' we particularly extend our condolences to the family and friends of @entity4			0
this was a shocking and tragic incident which provides lessons for all the agencies involved and for the wider health and social care systems			0
' it is important to remember that this tragic death occurred over seven years ago and much has changed since then			0
' we would also like to reassure @entity4 ’s family and the public that since these tragic events , the trust has rigorously and continually improved the areas of care that have been found by this report to fall short of good practice			2
' a statement from @entity42 said they acknowledged there had been failings in its procedures regarding risk assessment and have conducted a thorough review of their procedures .			0
