property guru @entity0 has called for the government to give tax breaks to three - generation families living under one roof			1
the television presenter said ‘ multi-generation living ’ would help to avert a social care ‘ disaster ’ because family members could more easily care for elderly relatives at home			1
it would also ease @entity14 ’s housing shortage by freeing up more homes – pushing down prices and bursting the property ‘ bubble ’			1
it would also reduce our reliance on childcare and after - school clubs because grandparents could care for their grandchildren while their children went out to work			1
the married mother - of - four relies on a nanny to help with childcare and admitted she would ‘ love it ’ if her own father or parents ’ - in - law moved in with her			1
as the owner of @entity44 – a 28 - bedroom mansion in @entity45 – and a @entity47 cottage in @entity48 , south @entity49 , she would not be a typical example for multi-generational living			1
but yesterday , she called for @entity14 to learn from @entity53 countries , where three generations more commonly lived together			1
the presenter of shows such as @entity57 and how to sell your @entity58 criticised planning restrictions which bowed too much to nimbys ( not in my back yard ) and prevented people from turning their homes into ones big enough for several generations			1
miss @entity0 says the plans would also ease @entity14 ’s housing shortage by freeing up more homes – pushing down prices and bursting the property bubble she said : ‘ i would really like to see encouragement of three - generational living			1
‘ it should be incentivised in terms of tax and in terms of planning			2
‘ instead of saying , ‘ we have got a housing problem but we wo n’t let anyone extend their home by three inches ’ , why do n’t we just let the person do their loft conversion			1
‘ i think nimbyism is still a problem , massively			2
i mean , we are nimbys in this country are n’t we ? ’			2
‘ i would have tax incentives , as well , for three generations living together , maybe council tax breaks			1
’ she said that , ‘ at the moment we have got a disaster waiting to happen with the cost of looking after older people ’ , but there is little planning to deal with this ‘ cost around the corner ’			1
she added : ‘ meanwhile we are encouraging parents to go to work but then you give it all back in tax and pay a load more for childcare			1
you are busting a gut the kids do n’t see you			2
‘ we have got parents who are too busy to help their children with their homework so we are paying for extra homework clubs			1
‘ the burden on the taxpayer of trying to pay for all these services is huge			0
it is much more efficient to take out the layers of bureaucracy			0
’ she added that it would ‘ loosen up housing problems in this country because there would be a lot more properties available ’			1
‘ it also encourages generations to look out for each other			0
it should be our mantra going forwards – let ’s try to fix the whole concept of family responsibility ’ , she said			0
but even with two large homes , she admits she has not yet managed to convince her own family to live with her			0
miss @entity0 and her artist husband @entity139 bought @entity140 listed 97 - room @entity44 in 2001 for £ 435,000 when it was in complete disrepair and made a programme , @entity144 ’s @entity143 , about the long , painful renovation to its former glory			1
but her father @entity147 , a retired architect , is reluctant to move in with his daughter and son - in - law and their four energetic young sons @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155			1
she said : ‘ i would love it but the funny thing is that my dad is n’t that keen			0
he just went " are you mad ? "			0
‘ @entity44 is full of weddings and @entity49 he would n’t want to live in because it ’s busy and it ’s manic and everyone ignores each other			0
‘ and we have a million children			0
i think they are lovely , but they are four boys			0
it ’s like having a litter of kittens around or puppies			0
‘ it is something i would really love to do – and with my mother - in - law and father - in - law too			2
‘ @entity139 and i talk endlessly about if we should leave @entity49 because i can see how it would work if we had a house and a separate annex , so they could have their own kitchen and their own bit of garden that they could go in and have a cup of tea without the kids going in			2
‘ my theory is that we would get somewhere with an annex and make it so nice and invite them to stay			0
eventually , they will say " i might as well stay " and i will say " well , why not hey			0
" ' miss @entity0 , who runs an online estate agents called @entity193 , called for urgent reform of the stamp duty land tax system , which she said was ‘ blocking the market ’ , claiming that the incremental system was ‘ madness ’			0
she argued the scheme would also reduce our reliance on childcare and after - school clubs because grandparents could care for their grandchildren while their children went out to work stamp duty jumps up rather than rising gradually and costs buyers at least £ 7,000 for a home over £ 250,000 and £ 20,000 for a house above £ 500,000			1
she said : ‘ there is no possible logic behind it			0
it is ridiculous , we have to get rid of the incremental system ’			0
stamp duty thresholds have also failed to rise with house prices , meaning more middle - class families are now caught by the tax once intended for the wealthy			1
miss @entity0 , 42 , said : ‘ in @entity49 , people with half a million pound properties are not wandering around with houses in the @entity223 and gold @entity224			0
‘ they are people who work their butts off , both of them working full - time busting a gut , both working 15 - hours a day so these are not loaded people with million pound bonuses			2
’ miss @entity0 also criticised @entity233 ’s plans for a mansion tax on all homes over £ 2 million			0
@entity236 has pledged to introduce the additional tax if they win the general election			0
she added : ‘ i think it ’s too low in my opinion , it sounds awful to say £ 2 million is n’t that much , but it sort of is n’t in some areas			2
‘ a long time ago , if you had a £ 2 million house , you would have staff and several cars			2
‘ but these are normal people who do their own washing and i slightly think it seems as if the threshold is slightly low			0
