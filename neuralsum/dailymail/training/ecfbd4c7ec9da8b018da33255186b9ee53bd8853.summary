@entity0 last night launched an investigation into claims that @entity4 students sang a ‘ despicable ’ song celebrating @entity7 massacres during meetings			1
members of the university ’s @entity10 were alleged to have given renditions of the song that revels in the killing of @entity14 during ‘ port and policy ’ nights			1
one video , filmed in the common room at @entity21 college , is said to show a student drunkenly chanting : ‘ @entity24 ’ , before being silenced by another member			1
@entity26 president @entity25 with a friend			1
they were not involved in the alleged racist singing the song ’s full version , to the tune of @entity33 , continues : ‘ dashing through the @entity34 / in a black @entity35 / killing lots of kike / ra ta ta ta ta			1
’ the word ‘ kike ’ is a derogatory term for @entity14 people			1
one member of the @entity10 , who declined to be named , told the @entity46 newspaper : ‘ lots of people were singing it that night , and indeed on many other nights , and the general attitude is that that was ok			1
‘ the thing is , lots of members do find that song , and songs like that one , absolutely despicable , though little is done to stop it			1
i am very worried with the direction the society is going in at present			2
’ pictures taken from ‘ port and policy ’ nights during the past year also showed members of the society rolling around drunk on the floor			2
one was photographed pouring port into a friend ’s mouth through a pith helmet			2
excess : a member drinks port poured through a pith helmet			2
neither was involved in the @entity7 singing another photo shows two members dressed as @entity76 next to a coal miner outfit bearing an offensive placard which reads : ‘ i love shafting			1
’ last night , @entity80 , a former president of the @entity26 , told the @entity81 he was resigning from it in protest about the ‘ debauched ’ behaviour of many of his fellow members			2
the third year @entity88 student said : ‘ it is disgusting and goes against everything the @entity4 stands for			1
' i came from a single - parent family and went to a state school and had to work for everything i have achieved			2
‘ but unfortunately the majority of members are rich former public schoolboys with a great sense of entitlement who are far more interested in drinking port than discussing policy			2
’ a former treasurer of the association recently wrote to members to complain about the ‘ excessive and crass ’ singing at meetings			1
he wrote : ‘ the dissonance is enough to inflict pain as short , spotty , still - pubescent boys struggle to fix their unsteady voices on any pitch at all			0
‘ this unbridled clamour is disturbing finalists who live near the @entity117 , many of whom are sounder conservatives than most , but who do n’t feel the need to dress up in ridiculous clothes or pretend that we still have an empire			0
’ @entity124 and former @entity4 leaders @entity126 and @entity127 have all given talks to the association in recent years			0
its former presidents include @entity134 members @entity132 and @entity135			0
the @entity26 is affiliated with @entity136 , the party ’s youth wing , and regularly supports candidates in local elections			0
during last year ’s general election , five former presidents stood for parliamentary seats			0
the @entity7 song allegation is just the latest controversy to hit the association in recent years			0
two years ago it was temporarily banned from using @entity0 in its title after members were urged to compete to see who could tell the most offensive racist joke			0
yesterday an @entity0 spokesman said : ‘ the university proctors , who are responsible for discipline , have been made aware of the [ @entity46 ] article and will be considering whether there are grounds for further investigation			0
‘ the university strongly condemns any form of racism or discrimination			0
’ @entity25 , the current president of the @entity10 who took over after the alleged racist singing took place , said he had started an investigation into the allegations			1
he said : ‘ if it turns out this person is a member we will take immediate action to expel them from the association			0
racism has no place in the association or our society			0
