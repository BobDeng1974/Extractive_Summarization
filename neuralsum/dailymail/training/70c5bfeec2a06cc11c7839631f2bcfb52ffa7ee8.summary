by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 08:49 est , 15 november 2013 updated : 10:00 est , 15 november 2013 @entity2 said it would be harder now for a comprehensive pupil to become foreign secretary now it is harder today for a state - educated teenager to reach the top than a generation ago , @entity2 has admitted			1
the foreign secretary , who attended a @entity11 comprehensive , warned there has been a ‘ disturbing ’ decline in social mobility over the past three decades			1
but as the row over the @entity16 being dominated by a privately - educated elite rumbles on , mr @entity2 insisted he had ‘ never felt socially inferior to anybody ’			1
mr @entity2 spoke out after former prime minister sir @entity19 condemned the ‘ shocking ’ way the upper echelons of society were filled by the privately - educated and affluent individuals in powerful positions			1
prime minister @entity25 also suggested yesterday that social mobility is being held back because people from outside the white middle - class can lack the ‘ aspiration ’ to make it into top jobs			2
mr @entity2 , who attended the state wath - upon - @entity33 , put the blame on shortcomings in the education system , which he said were being tackled by education secretary @entity37			2
mr @entity2 told @entity38 's today programme : ‘ i did go to a comprehensive school and i 've become the foreign secretary so not everything goes to privately - educated people			1
‘ the disturbing thing , i would say , is that in the 30 - odd years since i was at a comprehensive school , it probably in those intervening decades will have become a bit harder for somebody from a comprehensive school to become the foreign secretary , or whatever position they aspire to			0
‘ that reflects on a long period of this country falling too far behind in the world in state education , and thankfully we now have the best @entity37 in living memory - or longer - who is trying to put that right			0
’ mr @entity2 insisted he had never felt ' socially inferior ' to @entity62 - educated prime minister @entity25 mr @entity2 played down the suggestion that his state - school background left him feeling ‘ socially inferior ’ to @entity62 - educated mr @entity25			1
‘ i can tell you , having grown up in @entity11 , in @entity66 , and been to a comprehensive school , i 've never felt socially inferior to anybody			2
and i have met most of the kings , presidents , queens and princes of the world , ’ he said			0
sir @entity19 said the dominance of the well - heeled was ' shocking ' ministers have been at pains to stress the work being done in education and welfare to raise achievements and aspirations of children from poorer backgrounds			2
it follows sir @entity19 ’s repeated interventions in which he has spoken out about the dangers of out - of - touch well - heeled politicians indifferent to the needs of the poor			0
his latest remarks were seen as a thinly - veiled reference to the wealthy backgrounds of mr @entity25 's government , in contrast to sir @entity19 's own upbringing in a rented flat in @entity98 , @entity99			1
during a speech to the @entity101 on friday evening , sir @entity19 said : ‘ in every single sphere of @entity106 influence , the upper echelons of power in 2013 are held overwhelmingly by the privately educated or the affluent middle class			0
‘ to me , from my background , i find that truly shocking			0
’ @entity110 rejected the criticism , insisting policies to help people get on were more important than the background of politicians			0
but education secretary mr @entity37 , who was adopted at just four months , insisted sir @entity19 was ' right '			1
he told @entity38 : ' it ’s an inescapable fact			0
and that ’s one of the reasons why both i was speaking today about social work and the vital need to make sure that vulnerable children do n’t suffer from neglect and do n’t have their futures blighted			0
