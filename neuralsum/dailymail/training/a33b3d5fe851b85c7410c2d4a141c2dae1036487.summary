by @entity0 last updated at 11:23 pm on 6th february 2012 @entity2 bosses were yesterday shamed into giving up bonus payments worth up to £ 1.4million			1
the decision follows a ferocious public backlash against plans which could have seen the taxpayer - funded firm ’s six executive directors share a total of £ 20million by 2015			1
last week @entity2 was forced to apologise after it admitted health and safety breaches over the deaths of two teenage girls at a level crossing in 2005			0
unprecedented step : transport secretary @entity16 had planned to attend the @entity2 members ' meeting on friday to shame executives , such as chief sir @entity20 , into giving up their bonuses it said yesterday that its executive directors would hand any bonuses they received this year – which are expected to total up to £ 1.4million – to a ‘ safety fund ’ to improve level crossings			1
the firm – which receives £ 4billion a year from the public purse to run the rail network – also said it would rethink plans for a long - term bonus scheme that could hand the directors up to £ 15.6million over the next three years			1
taken with their annual bonus payments over that time , the bonuses could have totalled £ 20million by 2015			1
the climbdown came after transport secretary @entity16 threatened to gatecrash a meeting on friday that had been set to rubber - stamp the bonus package			1
yesterday the firm said the meeting had been shelved while it ‘ reflected ’ on the level of bonuses it should offer			2
the directors on the @entity2 board were each entitled to bonus payments of up to 60 per cent of their salary this year - which could have been worth £ 1,392,000			1
the discretionary payouts are dependent on performance targets being hit - but chief - executive sir @entity20 could have pocketed £ 336,000 - on top of his £ 560,000 basic salary			1
in total , the generous bonus package could have been worth £ 20million to the board between now and 2015			1
under complicated arrangements , the directors receive both ' short - term ' annual bonuses and ' long - term ' bonuses			1
a spokesman for @entity2 said a new incentives package for subsequent years will now have to be agreed			0
given the pressure being exerted by the government to cut executive pay , in future bonuses are unlikely to be anything like as extravagant			2
below are the salaries each of the @entity66 receives and in brackets the bonus they could have received this year			2
sir @entity69 £ 560,000 , ( £ 336,000 ) @entity70 finance director £ 350,000 , ( £ 210,000 ) @entity72 £ 330,000 , ( £ 198,000 ) @entity73 , @entity74 £ 440,000 , ( £ 264,000 ) @entity75 , investment projects £ 330,000 , ( £ 198,000 ) @entity77 £ 310,000 , ( £ 186,0 miss @entity16 , who described the bonus proposals as ‘ unacceptable ’ , last night welcomed the ‘ sensible ’ u-turn			1
she said : ‘ i have made it clear to @entity2 at every stage that this proposed package did not go far enough in reflecting the need for restraint			0
‘ the fact that its executive directors have also chosen to forfeit their annual bonuses to improve level crossings is a sign that they have recognised the strength of public opinion			2
’ @entity92 last night urged other organisations to ‘ reflect ’ on the move			0
the prime minister ’s spokesman said : ‘ all parts of the public sector should be reflecting on the financial environment and taking responsible decisions			0
’ however , @entity2 last night confirmed that it would be bringing forward new proposals for executive bonuses in the coming weeks			0
it issued a statement saying it would ‘ take the opportunity to reflect further on how to incentivise performance in the company against the backdrop of the current context ’			0
a spokesman said the firm had a legal duty to offer bonuses to its staff			0
one of the firm ’s 78 - strong members ’ board told the @entity117 that bonuses were being used as a substitute for pay rises			0
he said three directors had threatened to quit unless they received the cash			2
chief executive sir @entity20 , who is paid a basic salary of £ 560,000 , was in line for a £ 336,000 annual bonus and a £ 1.8million long - term bonus			1
last week he apologised on behalf of @entity2 after it admitted health and safety breaches over the deaths of @entity131 , 14 , and @entity132 , 13 , who were hit by a train in 2005 at @entity134 in @entity135			0
the directors ’ decision to donate their bonuses to a safety fund was welcomed by @entity140 , leader of the @entity142 rail union , who said : ‘ this decision is sadly too little , too late for the parents of the girls who tragically died			0
‘ but we welcome it as the first step in the direction of the directors starting to put safety and the passengers ahead of their own handsome rewards			0
’ payout : the directors at @entity2 - who run the tracks - had been in line for payouts worth £ 20million @entity2 last week admitted health and safety breaches over the deaths of @entity131 , 14 , and @entity132 , 13 , pictured , shortly before the huge bonus for sir @entity20 was announced @entity161 mp @entity160 , who led a @entity163 debate on the issue last week , urged ministers to ensure that the firm was not able to slip through proposals for big bonuses when public controversy about the issue dies down			1
she said : ‘ the original proposals were a disgrace			0
‘ they should be ashamed that they were even considering these massive bonuses at a time when performance is getting worse			0
‘ it is welcome that they are going to waive their bonuses this year , but this must not become a one - off gesture			2

transport secretary @entity16 threatened to attend meeting to shame staff into *abandoning* bonuses
new directors bonus scheme will now be worked out - and it is likely to be much less generous
chief - executive sir @entity20 could have received £ 336,000 this year - on top of £ 560,000 salary
