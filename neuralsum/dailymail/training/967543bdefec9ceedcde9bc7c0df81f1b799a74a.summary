by @entity0 published : 06:12 est , 15 may 2012 updated : 06:29 est , 15 may 2012 for years she warned of the devastation @entity4 infection could wreak if it took hold in an alpaca herd			1
but now campaigner and alpaca keeper @entity8 has been struck down by a severe case of the disease – caught from her own pets			1
ms @entity12 - who has called for more stringent compulsory tests of the animals amid fears @entity4 might tear through the @entity17 ’s alpaca population - was struck down in february with what appeared to be flu			1
struck down : award - winning alpaca farmer @entity20 was diagnosed with the life - threatening disease four years after it appeared in her herd but within eight days her condition had deteriorated into a life - threatening emergency			1
initial tests diagnosed a severe chest infection or pneumonia and doctors prescribed antibiotics			1
but after symptoms got worse concerned medics ordered a chest x-ray which confirmed pulmonary bovine tb			2
it is thought she may have been carrying the disease – while can have a lengthy incubation period - for years after eight of the animals put down in 2009 when they tested positive for bovine @entity4			1
she said : ‘ in 2009 i took all the necessary precautions to protect myself and yet it has happened to me			0
’ the 51 - year - old , from @entity44 , @entity45 , is now on the road to recovery – despite being hit by serious side - effects from the powerful course of medicine needed to fight the infection			1
she said : ‘ i started a nine month regime of a cocktail of drugs and was advised the side effects can be very unpleasant but at least i can be cured			0
‘ i was also told i would start to feel better in two to three weeks time			0
‘ unfortunately , eight days into the course i had severe side effects to the drugs which included severe all over body rash – blurred vision – faintness – severe headache and aching joints and had to seek emergency care			2
recovery : ms @entity8 , who is undergoing a nine - month course of antibiotics , believes she caught the disease from her animals and is warning about the dangers of not monitoring the spread of @entity4 tightly enough ‘ the drugs were stopped immediately and once again i had to go to hospital			1
i am now on drugs to sort out the side effects and once they have cleared then the @entity4 drugs can be reintroduced one at a time until we discover which drug caused the problem			1
' tb in humans is n’t a quick fix – and it certainly is n’t a case of two weeks of standard antibiotics and you will be right as rain			0
ms @entity8 had received an award from the @entity89 ( @entity89 ) , which promotes the welfare of alpacas and llamas for the campaign			1
she has urged government bodies to close a bovine tb testing loophole which means llamas , alpacas and other camelids do not need to be tested			2
according to the @entity100 the risk of humans contracting bovine @entity4 is low			1
but 500 had to be killed after an outbreak in a farm in @entity103 , @entity104 , last month			2
@entity105 can pose an extra risk to humans because , unlike cattle , they spit a mixture of saliva and gastric fluid			0
there are currently 1,500 alpaca owners of an estimated 35,000 animals registered with the @entity89			2
as of april 2012 the number of alpaca and llama herds that have been affected by culture confirmed incidents of bovine tb in @entity121 and @entity122 was 58 , according to @entity123			1
the animals , which originally come from the high plains of @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 in @entity129 , are normally bred for their wool			0
living in close proximity to animals can bring with it the danger of contract diseases common in the animal world			0
there have been numerous cases in @entity17 where owners have suffered severe and even fatal conditions caught from their pets			0
a conservationist from @entity143 , @entity144 , died after contracting @entity17 's first case of rabies for 100 years - from a bat bite			2
@entity148 , 56 , right , failed to recover from @entity149 ( @entity149 ) , a type of rabies , for which there is no cure , found in several northern @entity155 countries			0
mr @entity148 , who was licensed to handle bats , was bitten by one of a species known as @entity159 on at least one occasion			0
@entity161 , 18 , from @entity162 , @entity163 , suffered a mysterious lung disease for five which has left her on oxygen 24 hours a day - until tests showed the symptoms were caused by her pet cockatiel			0
doctors had struggled to find the route of her crippling condition , diagnosing childhood asthma and pulmonary fibrosis			0
but specialists at a @entity177 hospital discovered she had hypersensitivity pneumonitis caused by protein dust from @entity181 the cockatiel 's droppings			0
also known as ' bird fancier 's lung ' , it is harmless to most people but can trigger breathing difficulties in a minority of people			0
doctors say ms @entity161 's lungs would take two years to properly clear .			1

doctors at first thought @entity8 , 51 , had developed the flu
within days of feeling ill she was *rushed* to hospital with life - threatening illness
ms @entity8 may have been carrying infection for years after her alpaca herd was hit by an outbreak
she faces nine - months of *treatment* to recover from bovine @entity4 infection ' caught from her herd '
