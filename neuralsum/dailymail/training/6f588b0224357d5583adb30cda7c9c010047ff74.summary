but the 82 - year - old has been told by medical staff that mrs @entity7 - who can no longer sit up on her own and has to be fed through a tube - needs 24 - hour care by qualified staff at a care home			1
now mr @entity18 says he plans to fight the case ' tooth and nail ' so he can care for his wife - even if it ends up at the highest @entity38 court			1

mr @entity18 said : ' she has not moved out of that ward since she went in there			2
if anything , she is deteriorating			0

i do n’t believe them			0

we are two complete opposites , and that ’s a good thing			0
