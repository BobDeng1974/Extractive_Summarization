a giant mystery sea creature is thought to have been spotted in the turquoise waters of one of @entity4 ’s most idyllic bays			2
a huge unexplained wake can be seen in a @entity7 image of @entity8 , in the @entity9 , an area on the east coast of the @entity11 of the country 's @entity12 , captured by satellite at about 11.30am on january 30			1

a long swirled wake was spotted on @entity7 in @entity8 , part of the @entity9 in @entity4 @entity15 said the wake could have been left by a creature around 12 metres in size mr @entity15 , from @entity27 , @entity4 , said : ‘ the native @entity30 would call this a " @entity33 " ( ' @entity34 ' ) as it appears not to be a whale and it is far too big to be a shark			1
it is moving too fast and turning too sharply to be a whale			0
’ mr @entity15 also ruled out that a boat was the cause of the wake because there is no white froth like normal wakes created by motors			1
‘ i spotted it about a week ago			2
we have some property near @entity8 and i ’m about to build a beach chalet up there , i zoomed down and found that , ’ he said			2
‘ it ’s way too wide for a shark and way too long … it ’s got to have a lot of weight under the water to create that kind of drag			0
’ engineer @entity15 spotted the wake while on @entity7 about a week ago when compared to the white wake that a motoriesd boat in the area makes it is clear to see they are very different @entity8 has a quite white sand beach and the water stays shallow for around 40 metres ‘ with a sudden deep drop into the bay ’			1
‘ there is a lot of undergrowth in the deeper parts of the @entity8 , ’ mr @entity15 explained			1
the unusual sighting comes after an aerial photograph appeared to show a giant crab that was at least 50ft - wide lurking in shallow water in @entity75			0
the incredible image , shared online in october , could soon have visitors flocking to the seaside town of @entity79 , in @entity80 , in the hope of catching @entity83 's biggest crab			0
while some insist it is proof of ' @entity87 ' , others argue that the shadowy figure is nothing more than an unusually - shaped sandbank - or is simply a playful hoax			0

engineer @entity15 spotted a large unexplained wake about a week ago
he was looking at @entity8 , in the @entity9 , an area on the east coast of the @entity11 of @entity4 's @entity12
it was **n't** caused by a boat because there is no white foam from a motor
mr @entity15 also does **n't** think a shark or whale could have caused it
