by @entity1 reporter published : 18:04 est , 21 february 2013 updated : 18:04 est , 21 february 2013 desperate childless women who smuggle babies into the country ought to receive some sympathy , a top judge has ruled			1
according to @entity11 , women who break the law to bring a child home should be shown mercy , not treated as ‘ people traffickers ’			2
the comments came as he presided over the case of @entity17 , who was so desperate to become a mother that she pretended a girl born in the @entity20 to a couple ‘ who could not afford to keep her ’ was her own			2
lord @entity11 said childless mothers like @entity17 , pictured with husband @entity25 , should not be treated as ' human traffickers '			1
mrs @entity17 was jailed after trying to smuggle a baby into the @entity28 mrs @entity17 was jailed after giving the baby her surname , signing her birth certificate and seeking a resettlement visa for her			1
but she will be freed next month after judges in @entity34 ’s @entity33 understood her overwhelming desire for a child and said she ought not to be treated as a ‘ people trafficker ’			0
mrs @entity17 , 50 , from @entity38 , attempted to circumvent the @entity28 ’s complex adoption laws by making plans to smuggle the baby illegally into the country			1
after visiting the islands with husband @entity25 , a security guard , she tried to bring the baby back with her by pretending she had given birth to her there			0
but discrepancies on mrs @entity17 ’s passport when she applied to embassy officials for a visa for the baby ‘ gave the lie ’ to her claim of motherhood and revealed that she had not been in the @entity20 at the time she reported she had given birth			1
the application for a settlement visa was ‘ unsurprisingly rejected ’ and she was arrested on her return to the @entity28			0
the judge said that although a crime , she was motivated by ' her and her husband 's desire to adopt a child ' she was jailed for six months at @entity62 on january 22 , having pleaded guilty to trying to facilitate a breach of immigration laws			0
however , @entity65 , sitting with mr justice @entity66 and @entity66 justice @entity67 , cut her sentence by a third , meaning she will be freed next month			2
mrs @entity17 travelled to the islands in may 2011 , and , in june of that year , approached immigration officials at the @entity71 in @entity72 for a @entity28 settlement visa for the child			1
despite her failed attempt to bring the baby back to the @entity28 , mrs @entity17 had bonded so much with her during their few weeks together that she is continuing to provide financial support for her , the court heard			1
lord @entity11 said : ‘ she and her husband had wanted to adopt a child , and she had believed she had adopted the baby			2
she will be freed next month after the hearing at the @entity33 , at the @entity83 ‘ she had posed as the birth mother because she knew it would have taken a long time to complete the adoption process in the @entity20 and the @entity28			1
this was an attempt – not a sophisticated one , but it was persisted in – to circumvent legal adoption proceedings			0
the offence was completely out of character			0
‘ she attempted to facilitate the entry into the @entity28 , knowing that her actions constituted a breach of immigration law			0
this was a deliberate attempt to circumvent the immigration laws , which required much foresight and planning			0
‘ offending like this calls for general deterrence , but it is important to note that what was motivating mrs @entity17 was her and her husband ’s desire to adopt a child , and this was not a case of trafficking			2
‘ while an immediate custodial sentence was inevitable , and that sentence must reflect the need for deterrence , we are satisfied that a sentence of four months imprisonment was sufficient in these circumstances			0

lord @entity11 said childless women should be shown some sympathy
was *speaking* at appeal hearing of @entity17 , 50 , from @entity38
mrs @entity17 was jailed after trying to smuggle a @entity20 baby into the @entity28
