these infographics are a handy reminder of what not to do when on holiday , and will help travellers not to upset the locals			0
flowers , chocolates or other such subtle gifts are accepted			0
but no marigolds in @entity15 - they are associated with death and witchcraft			2
you have to be careful with your gift of flowers in @entity30 too - steer clear of carnations as they are associated with funerals			1
it 's always best in this situation to ask the host what their favourite flowers are in advance			0

if you **'re** going to make an effort , it 's *worth* doing your research
