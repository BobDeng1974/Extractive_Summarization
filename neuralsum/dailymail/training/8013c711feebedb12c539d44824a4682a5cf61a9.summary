by @entity1 reporter published : 17:26 est , 29 april 2013 updated : 05:30 est , 1 may 2013 a woman who bought a can of green beans on sale for 69 cents got way more than she paid for when she opened it to find a whole toad			1
but if you ask her , she ’ll specify that it was missing its leg ( they were mixed in with the beans )			1
@entity14 of @entity15 , @entity13 did n’t notice the critter as she opened the can of @entity19 beans and microwaved them for her family ’s dinner of meatloaf , mashed potatoes , and gravy			2
but when her son scooped some onto his plate , he noticed it had something extra			2
disgusting : @entity13 woman @entity14 opened a can of green beens and found a toad ‘ i thought maybe it was a piece of moldy bacon or something , ’ @entity36 told @entity37			1
‘ because they have bacon in them sometimes			2
‘ and i took it out of there and it was n't moldy bacon			1
it was a toad with parts of his little legs all in the green beans , other than that he was fully intact			2
’ @entity14 could n’t believe her eyes			2
‘ i was sick , nauseated for two days , ’ said @entity36			1
@entity14 took her purchase back to the store where she ’d purchased them , @entity19			0
they gave her a full refund for the can with the toad and all the other cans she ’d purchased along with it			0
she also took the can in question , and its slimy contents , to the @entity66			0
there , food service director @entity67 sent her to the @entity70 @entity69			0
appalled : ' nauseated for two days , ' is how @entity14 , right , described her reaction to a toad , left , she found in a 69 cent can of green beans their conclusion ? the toad was , indeed , packed in the can along with the beans			1
canned food processing , @entity14 learned , is so fast paced the toad was likely totally overlooked			0
‘ when the green beans were picked from the field , it was also placed on a conveyor line and just was accidentally put into the can of green beans during process , ’ said @entity67			0
that did n’t sit well with @entity14			0
‘ i think they should come up with a better way of inspecting and canning vegetables			1
i mean anything can happen you know but a whole frog ? ’ she said			0
last week , the company that processed the can sent @entity14 an apology and $ 50			1
@entity19 grcers sent @entity37 a statement saying , ‘ we sincerely regret this customer 's experience , and we are in the process of investigating the incident			0
’ according to the @entity13 @entity69 , rodents and insects are also commonly found in canned food , as well as in frozen products			0
steal : the @entity19 brand beans got @entity14 and apology and fifty bucks , but she did n't think it was worth it common : local health department official @entity67 explained that the toad was likely scooped up during harvesting and overlooked			1

@entity36 got the can one sale for 69 cents , but it was n't the steal she expected
along with an apology , the canning company gifted her with $ 50
