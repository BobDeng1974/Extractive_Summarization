in the second promise , to ' pray for them ' , he explains : ' i wo n't pray that @entity32 will heal or change or fix them			1

' ' above all , ' he adds , ' i 'll pray to @entity32 that my children wo n't allow the @entity45 treatment they might receive from some of his misguided children , to keep them from pursuing him			1
' thirdly , he will love them - clarifying that he will not love them despite their sexuality or because of it			2

' they are today , simply a younger version of who they will be -- and today they 're pretty darn great			0
