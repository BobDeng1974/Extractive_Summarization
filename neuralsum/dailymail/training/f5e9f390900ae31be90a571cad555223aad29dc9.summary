by @entity0 a couple have been left heartbroken after a leading ivf clinic destroyed their frozen embryos by mistake – and with it their hopes of giving their son a brother or sister			1
@entity10 and @entity11 had planned to have the embryos implanted to expand their family and give their five - year - old son a sibling			1
but in a terrible administrative blunder , the embryos were removed from the deep - freeze at @entity20 in @entity21			1
a couple have been left heartbroken after a leading @entity2 clinic destroyed their frozen embryos by mistake - and with it their hopes of giving their son a brother or sister ( file photo ) staff at the @entity31 clinic , which is part of the @entity33 , took them out because they had not received a consent form from the couple which they needed by law to keep the embryos in storage			1
originally they told the @entity43 the form had not arrived at the hospital , but it has now emerged that the document , which the couple sent recorded delivery , did arrive – but may have been sent to the wrong department			2
last night the @entity50 admitted there had been a mistake and offered its ‘ heartfelt apologies ’ to the couple			2
but mr @entity55 , 39 , a property landlord , said : ‘ this should not have happened			2
we have been punished because of someone ’s negligence			2
our world has been turned upside down			0
they have taken away our dreams			0
‘ our son is an adorable boy and i feel that we owe him a sibling , but now we can not give him that			1
’ the couple , from @entity67 , said they had decided to bring the matter to the public ’s attention to make sure that it ‘ never happens again ’			0
staff at the @entity31 clinic , which is part of the @entity33 , took them out because they had not received a consent form from the couple which they needed by law to keep the embryos in storage ( file photo ) mrs @entity11 , 35 , originally underwent @entity2 with donor eggs to conceive their son , who is now almost six			1
she had the treatment after being told her chances of conceiving naturally were virtually zero			0
the @entity2 cycle , which used mr @entity55 ’s sperm and the same donor ’s eggs , resulted in two spare viable embryos that were subsequently put in storage			1
but last week they discovered that both the embryos had been destroyed			1
@entity92 , head of midwifery at the @entity50 , said the consent form may have been signed for in a different hospital department – meaning staff at the @entity50 never got it			0
she added : ‘ we are carrying out a full review into what has happened and i would like to offer our heartfelt apologies to the couple concerned			0
we can only imagine how distressed they must be			0
’ she insisted that the unit had stored embryos for ‘ hundreds of couples over the past 13 years and this has never happened before ’			1
and she explained that it was routine practice to send out consent forms when the initial five - year storage period was up , adding : ‘ regrettably the @entity112 did not receive the recorded delivery letter which was sent back by the couple stating that they wanted to extend the storage period			1
as a consequence of this the embryos were then thawed			2
‘ we have contacted the couple to apologise formally and we will be providing them with a full response in writing once the review is complete to explain fully what happened			0
‘ we will also be looking at any additional changes that need to be put in place to limit the chances of this happening again			0
we are so very sorry this has happened			0
