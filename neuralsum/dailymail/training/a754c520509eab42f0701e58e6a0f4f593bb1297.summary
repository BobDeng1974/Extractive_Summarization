@entity1 @entity0 of @entity2 : dna tests show prince @entity4 is of @entity1 descent dna testing has revealed that prince @entity4 will become the first @entity8 monarch of @entity1 ancestry			1
a clear genetic line has been drawn between the @entity11 and a half - @entity1 woman , potentially marking him as the first @entity0 whose bloodline is descended from the country			1
analysis of saliva samples on relatives of prince @entity4 revealed the link between the second in line to the throne and a distant relative from his mother ’s family			1
the revelation will prompt calls for the 30 - year - old prince to make his maiden visit to @entity1 , following in the footsteps of his parents who travelled there in 1992			1
the genetic link with @entity1 is believed to originate from @entity36 ’s great - great - great - great - great grandmother @entity35			1
although often described as @entity37 , dna analysis has revealed that she was at least half - @entity1 and is known to have lived in the country ’s western region			1
@entity43 scientists established the link after discovering that @entity35 ’s descendants carried a rare strand of @entity38 - known as mitochondrial dna - which can only be passed on by a mother			1
only people from the @entity1 subcontinent have been found to carry the particular strand of @entity38			1
it has been recorded in 14 other people - all @entity1 , apart from one @entity55 native			1
the dna is thought to have been passed down to prince @entity4 and his brother @entity56 , as the scientist behind the research described the genetic link as ‘ unassailable ’			1
the tests were carried out by genetics expert @entity61 , from the @entity62 and a group called @entity64 , who said that the princes would be unable to pass the dna to their children			0
a clear genetic line has been drawn between the @entity11 and @entity35 , who was at least half - @entity1 and is known to have lived in the country 's western region from mother to son : the dna has been passed down from @entity75 's side of the family from prince @entity4 's great - great - great - great - great grandmother @entity35 who was half - @entity1 it has not been revealed which relations of @entity4 supplied the saliva samples to allow the dna to be tested			1
princess @entity75 ’s maternal aunt @entity80 told @entity81 : ‘ i always assumed that i was part - @entity37 so i am delighted that i also have an @entity1 background			1
’ @entity35 was married to @entity83 , who left his wife and sent their daughter , @entity85 , to live in @entity8 aged six			0
letters sent from @entity88 to her estranged husband were discovered by researchers in which she begged to be able to see her children again			0
princess @entity75 pictured at the @entity94 ( left ) and wearing a garland ( right ) during her visit to @entity1 , in 1992 first and last : the dna will not be passed on to the @entity11 and @entity97 of @entity11 's child as the mitochondrial dna is linked to the mother 's side the communication suggests that @entity103 turned his back on his wife , potentially due to her race , referring to her as his ‘ housekeeper ’ in his will after he died returning to @entity8 on a ship in 1820			1
he also described her as the ‘ purported mother ’ of @entity85			0
@entity38 , also known as the @entity112 , is inherited solely from the mother in most species , including humans			1
tracing the gene has become an important tool in anthropology and field biology as it allows scientists to study links between populations			0
it is believed to have evolved separately from nuclear dna , deriving from the circular genomes of bacteria engulfed by the early ancestors of the modern - day eukaryotic cells			2
according to the @entity130 , it is believed by some molecular biologists that at one stage the mitochondrion was a free - living organism with its own dna			2
they say it also held the key for generating lots of energy			0
it then invaded single - celled nucleated organisms and has remained ever since			0
while males can not pass the dna on to their children , they do receive and use their mother 's mitochondrial dna			1
if the @entity11 and @entity97 do decide to make a state visit to the country after the expected birth of the couple ’s baby in july , the second in line to the throne will hope that their experience is more harmonious than his parents			1
princess @entity75 was famously pictured sitting alone outside the @entity94 , an @entity1 landmark regarded as symbol of love , without her husband in sight			2
his direct genetic lineage could be seized upon by @entity164 as a way of boosting the @entity8 monarchy ’s popularity in the country			2
@entity169 , the founder of @entity64 , said : ‘ knowing something about your dna and its origins in prehistory definitely changes your sense of yourself , and one way that it does that is to make you feel part of a world community			2
’ historian @entity169 told @entity182 how before @entity1 became a part of the @entity184 in the mid- 19th century , it was governed by the @entity185 , who employed armies and generals and even fought wars , including @entity191 's famous campaign against the @entity192 which culminated in the victory at @entity194			2
mr @entity169 said : ' when @entity195 became governor general of the @entity185 , he began to appoint more and more @entity43 to important positions			0
' when @entity83 came to @entity198 to work , he probably came into contact with the tea merchants who brought tea to @entity8 in the tea clippers , the wonderful sailing ships			0
perhaps the @entity206 is the best known			0
princess @entity75 was famously pictured sitting alone outside the @entity94 , an @entity1 landmark regarded as symbol of love , during the visit to the country the @entity212 receives the traditional southern @entity1 greeting of a @entity214 on the forehead from @entity216 , mother of the governor of @entity219 , as they visit him at the start of the last full day of his and @entity75 's visit to the country ' @entity43 entrepreneurs had invested so heavily in the @entity1 tea industry that it outstripped production in @entity228			1
' as the third son of a @entity43 landowner , @entity103 needed to make his fortune elsewhere and like many ambitious young men , he went to @entity1 to do just that			2
' when @entity83 arrived in the @entity234 he employed a housekeeper , @entity35			0
they had three children , one of whom , @entity236 or @entity237 , was the ancestress of princess @entity75			0
' the wedding of @entity243 and @entity244 , 4th @entity245 , at @entity247 's @entity246 , @entity248 , @entity43 prince @entity4 's @entity1 ancestry can be traced back through his family tree which reveals his genetic link with @entity35			1
@entity35 had three children with @entity83 after he arrived in @entity1 , working for the @entity185			2
one of their children , @entity85 , became a well - respected member of society in @entity43 and married @entity257 , a member of the family that manufactured the coats of the same name , in @entity262 , in march 1837			0

dna testing proves that the @entity11 is of @entity1 ancestry
he will become first king of @entity2 with genetic link to @entity1
prince @entity4 's great - great - great - great - great grandmother was half - @entity1
@entity4 will be first and last monarch with the @entity38 link as it can only be passed on by a mother
@entity314 will prompt calls for prince to make maiden visit to the country
