by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent published : 18:28 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 18:29 est , 12 june 2013 a senior @entity3 cleric was dubbed ‘ divisive , unfair and wrong ’ yesterday after suggesting older people should get less help from the state			2
@entity8 @entity7 condemned the way today ’s ‘ fortunate generation ’ of retirees are soaking up tax - payers ’ money			1
he used a speech to say @entity16 spending on so - called baby boomers – those born in the 20 years after the @entity19 – ‘ raises questions of intergenerational equity ’			1
' divisive ' : @entity22 has drawn criticism for a speech in which he suggested older people should get less help from the state but the @entity8 , who at 65 is himself a member of the group he criticises , has drawn rapid criticism from pension experts and pressure groups			1
retirement fund specialist and author dr @entity30 said : ‘ what is forgotten is that this generation is n’t lucky			1
they built up the economy			2
in reality the government has taken advantage of them			2
‘ they come to the later stages of their lives after working and saving all their lives			0
‘ younger people look on in envy at wealthy older people , and they think they are representative of an entire generation			1
but most people in their 60s and 70s are on or below average income			0
’ she added : ‘ the idea of an intergenerational war is very dangerous to our social fabric			1
what young people should be doing is aspiring to be like their elders			0
’ @entity22 , who is third in the hierarchy of the @entity3 and who led the service for @entity68 ’s funeral in april , said baby boomers were lucky to have seen huge improvements in their standard of living during their lives			1
' fortunate ' : the third in the hierarchy of the @entity3 condemned the way retirees are soaking up taxpayers ' money however , state spending had more than doubled in 15 years and ‘ much is absorbed by the fortunate generation to which i belong ’ he added			1
his speech appeared to agree with some politicians and think tanks that spending on the elderly is unfair on the young and that older people could be taxed out of larger homes			0
however , @entity91 of the @entity92 ’ @entity90 said : ‘ this is all a bit more complicated than the baby boomer bishop would like us to believe			1
‘ we should not be trying to divide one generation from another			1
‘ @entity98 thinks older people are a burden on the state			0
but they are the people who paid for the pensions of the generation before them , and now the working generation is paying their pensions			2
that is the way it has worked since 1948			0
