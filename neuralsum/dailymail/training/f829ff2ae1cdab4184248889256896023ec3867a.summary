@entity0 , 59 , said the £ 306,000 she put into the @entity4 bank was the proceeds of sale of a @entity16 house that her @entity18 ex-partner dr @entity17 had paid for			1
although the account was in her name she regarded the money as ' in trust ' for dr @entity17 and their children @entity24 and @entity27 and not hers to use , she told @entity28			1
the prosecution has alleged that she was a ' greedy and dishonest ' woman who milked the state just for ' pocket money ' to top up a luxury lifestyle which included putting her children through fee - paying schools including @entity34			1
prosecutor @entity35 claimed at the start of the trial that ms @entity0 made a ' calm , calculated and rational ' decision to abuse the benefits system			1

but ms @entity0 said she did not use the money except for paying the children 's school fees or any other expense on their behalf which dr @entity17 authorised			1
she herself was without a home after the house sale and was heavily in debt , ultimately being declared bankrupt in 2012 , she told the jury			1
giving evidence on the second day of her trial she said she always considered the @entity62 's account to be dr @entity17 's because the money resulted from the sale of the house he had bought			1
he had been an @entity68 based businessman who was often away from home but she regarded him as the ' love of my life , ' even after their relationship ended , she said			0
she told the jury he died in may last year from bowel and colon cancer but she still regarded the @entity4 bank money as for the benefit of her children - 24 year old freddie , who now lives in @entity83 , and @entity27 , now a geography student at @entity85			1
when she first applied for benefits in 2006 - 2007 it was because dr @entity17 had stopped financially supporting her and the children , she said			2
he later became embroiled in a court case in @entity90 where he was accused of fraud , she added			0
at that time , because she was worried they might lose the house , she went to @entity90 and got dr @entity17 to agree to transfer the house into her name			0
but she insisted that after the sale of the property she had always received authorisation to pay money out of the account			2
defence lawyer @entity102 asked why if she was in such difficult financial circumstances she did not pull the children out of private education to save money			2
but she said she wanted them to continue with their education uninterrupted			0
she told how after the relationship with dr @entity17 ended she began a relationship with a @entity112 spybase worker , @entity111 , who moved into the house with her			0
they took out a joint mortgage on the property to pay for repairs and an extension but when dr @entity17 found out about mr @entity111 he was ' beside himself with anger , ' she said			0
' he called me a whore and sentiments along those lines , ' she said			0
' he said the house was for the children , how could i have done such a thing , how could i have another relationship			2
he had every right to be angry and i was devastated			0
' her relationship with mr @entity111 ended a few weeks later and the house was sold and the £ 200,000 mortgage paid off - leaving her with the £ 306,000 equity , she said			1
she paid the money into an @entity139 bank and then started using the money which included paying fees to @entity34 ( pictured ) , the court heard the cheque for that was given to her in 2007 and she put it into the @entity145 , later transferring 200,000 euros to the @entity147 branch			2
' whose money was that ? ' asked mr @entity102			0
' @entity17 's , it was not mine , ' she replied			0
she said that dr @entity17 later came back into her life and he ran up debts of £ 140,000 on her @entity157 bank account after she made him a joint signatory to it			1
that was one of the debts she was left with when he died , she said			0
she told the jury that she also had a £ 60,000 school fees debt , she owed a friend £ 30,000 , another friend £ 10,000 and had rent arrears of £ 9,000			0
she was registered bankrupt in 2012			0
mr @entity102 asked why she had not solved all the financial problems by using the @entity4 account money			1
she said : ' because it was never my money			0
' however , the prosecution say that as the money was in her name it disqualified her from receiving benefits because no - one with assets of more than £ 16,000 is entitled to claim			2
ms @entity0 , formerly of @entity177 , @entity47 , but now living in @entity178 , @entity179 , denies four charges of dishonestly failing to report a change in her circumstances affecting her entitlement to benefits and dishonestly making false representations to obtain benefits between march 2007 and march 2009			2
