by @entity0 published : 05:49 est , 18 october 2012 updated : 07:02 est , 18 october 2012 the leader of an @entity3 group has been named as a commander in last month 's attack on the @entity7 consulate in @entity8 that killed three @entity7 including ambassador @entity9			1
@entity10 , who heads the @entity8 - based @entity12 group , was closely involved in the september 11 assault , according to @entity15 authorities			1
witnesses said they saw @entity10 lead the fatal assault , although his exact role has not been made clear			2
suspect : @entity10 , who heads the @entity12 group , was closely involved in the september 11 assault on the @entity7 embassy in @entity8 , according to @entity15 authorities ablaze : the fighters who attacked the @entity7 consulate came armed with machine guns , rocket - propelled grenades and mortars rage : a protester hols his rifle during the assault on the @entity8 consulate the claims further link @entity12 to the attack , the aftermath of which has triggered a diplomatic war of words between @entity37 and @entity38 in the final run - up to next month 's presidential election			1
@entity10 remains at large and has yet to be questioned in relation to the consulate blaze			2
a @entity7 official last week said the @entity37 administration is tracking @entity10 , but added that the assault was likely to have been an organised group effort and not the brainchild of one man			1
the official told the @entity49 : ' @entity12 is not only a shadowy group , it ’s also quite factionalised			2
there is n’t necessarily one overall military commander of the group			0
' @entity10 was a member of the @entity3 opposition when @entity54 was alive and was imprisoned in the notorious @entity56 jail			0
he was released last year and helped the rebels topple @entity58 from power			0
he then formed @entity12 - which means ' supporters of islamic law ' - with other like - minded former political prisoners			2
the group now numbers between 100 and 200 fighters			0
killed : ambassador @entity9 ( left ) died following smoke inhalation , while agent @entity67 ( right ) died in a desperate battle to save hi , heroic : former @entity70 ( left ) and @entity71 ( right ) were killed in a mortar attack family : mr @entity9 ' brother @entity74 , and sisters @entity76 and @entity77 , speak at his memorial service in @entity79 yesterday at loggerheads : the @entity37 administration 's handling of the aftermath of the @entity8 attack came to the fore during tuesday 's second presidential campaign debate the @entity88 ’s decision to hire @entity89 to guard the diplomatic mission in @entity8 entrusted security tasks to a little - known @entity93 company instead of the large firms it usually uses in overseas danger zones			1
the contract was largely based on expediency , @entity7 officials said , since no one knew how long the temporary mission would remain in the @entity15 city			1
the cradle of last year ’s uprising that ended @entity58 ’s 42 - year rule , @entity8 has been plagued by rising violence in recent months			2
security practices at the diplomatic compound , where @entity89 guards patrolled with flashlights and batons instead of guns , have come under @entity7 government scrutiny in the wake of the september 11 attack that killed @entity7 ambassador @entity9 and three other @entity7			1
federal contract data shows that the @entity8 security contract , worth up to $ 783,284 , was listed as a ' miscellaneous ' award , not as part of the large master @entity88 contract that covers protection for overseas embassies			2
' @entity89 was virtually unknown to the circles that studied private security contractors working for the @entity7 , before the events in @entity8 , ' said @entity126 , a commissioner at the @entity127 , which studied @entity7 contracting in the @entity130 and @entity131 wars			1
several @entity93 government sources said that they were unfamiliar with @entity89 , which is based in @entity133			2
they said @entity93 authorities used a different contractor for security protection in @entity15			1
@entity137 , vice president of intelligence at the @entity140 consulting firm and a former @entity7 diplomatic security agent , said he did not know @entity89 , but it likely got @entity88 work because it was already working in @entity15			1
@entity89 was able to work in @entity15 because it forged a business alliance with a local security firm , as required by @entity15 regulations			0
the firm hired about 20 @entity15 men - including some who say they had minimal training - to screen visitors and help patrol the mission at @entity8 , according to @entity153 interviews			1
some of the guards , who said they had been hired by @entity89 after a casual recruiting and screening process , sustained injuries and said they were ill - prepared to protect themselves or others when heavily armed militants last month stormed the rented villa that was serving as the mission			0
last week , the @entity88 said that it never believed the september 11 attack on the @entity7 consulate was the result of a protest over an anti-islam movie , contradicting previous statements			1
a dramatic new account revealed that mr @entity9 was locked inside a ' safe room ' and choked to death from diesel - heavy smoke as the building around him burned to the ground			0
alongside him was a security guard , tasked with the impossible choice between staying in the deadly room , or facing the rocket - propelled grenades and machine - guns outside			0
eventually the guard slipped through the window - and was cut down by the grenades			0
no - one saw the ambassador alive again - another agent tried desperately to enter the safe - room , but could not find him anywhere			0
the @entity88 's insistence that it never bought the story - as initially told by the @entity188 and @entity189 , @entity7 ambassador to the @entity190 - that a crude anti-islam film made in @entity192 triggered the attack gave ammunition against @entity37 to the @entity38 campaign			1
that came to the fore during tuesday 's second presidential campaign debate in @entity199 , @entity200			0
mr @entity37 said he accepted responsibility for the consulate attack but angrily denied there had been any sort of cover - up over the tragedy			1
he said : ' the suggestion that anyone on my team would play politics when we lost four of our own is offensive			0
' but mr @entity38 was dumfounded when mr @entity37 said that the day after the attack he had described it as an ' act of terror '			1
the transcript , however , made it unclear whether the president was speaking generally or more specifically about @entity8			0
during his @entity221 address on september 12 , the day following the attack in @entity8 , mr @entity37 said : ' no acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation , alter that character or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for			1
' while he did therefore establish a link between the raid and ' terror ' as a whole , he did not explicitly say that he believed it to have been conducted by terrorists			0
and over the next few days , the president repeatedly linked the attack to protests against a @entity7 - made @entity241 video mocking the @entity242 which were sweeping the @entity244 world at the time			2
the surviving members of the compound have described the overnight attack , which saw agents trapped in the burning compound before finally speeding away			0
as they drove through the crowd , attackers threw grenades and sprayed their armoured vehicle with gunfire from @entity257 assault rifles from a distance of two feet			0
meanwhile , the ambassador was locked in a safe - room as the compound filled with flames			0
when the decision was made to escape the diesel - heavy smoke , it was too late , and @entity9 never made it out			0
inferno : armed attackers dumped cans of diesel fuel and set ablaze the consulate 's exterior siege : the compound came under heavy mortar and gunfire during the attack , which lasted several hours haven : ambassador @entity9 and @entity67 were hiding in a safe room which later filled with diesel smoke flames , grenades and gunfire : a burnt - out car in front of the @entity7 consulate			1

@entity10 heads the @entity8 - based @entity12 group
@entity15 officials say he was closely involved in the september 11 assault that killed four @entity7 including ambassador @entity9
consulate security entrusted to little - own @entity93 company
how @entity37 handled aftermath of attack triggered war of words between the president and @entity38 in this week 's second presidential debate
