a member of the public reported it to the @entity14 as a porpoise , but experts confirmed it as a rare @entity7 ’s beaked whale			1
however , experts believe @entity7 's will start stranding more frequently in @entity5 as water temperatures increase due to climate change			1

' this carcass was in a poor condition with advanced decomposition , so we would suggest that the public do not touch any dead marine animals they find , as they can carry diseases that humans can catch			0
' it was a sad end for this amazing whale			0
however by examining these strandings it at least gives us a chance to investigate these animals properly and learn more about them			0
and the more we know , the better we 're able to fight for their protection			0
' examinations found the whale was a sub-adult or maturing male @entity7 's beaked whale			1
@entity7 's , like most beaked whales , are mostly found off - shore in waters 200m ( 656ft ) to 1,000m ( 3,280ft ) along continental shelves			1
