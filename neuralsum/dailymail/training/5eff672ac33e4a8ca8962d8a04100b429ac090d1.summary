welcome to the @entity2 , where those with something on their chest can go to lighten their load			0
developed by two @entity10 teenagers , customers are handed a baseball and hardhat , before unleashing on lamps , beds , tables and any other unfortunate piece of furniture			1
the teenage proprietors were inspired by a similar ' @entity38 ' in @entity39 , @entity40 , who thought a @entity10 version would be a surefire way to make money			1
the @entity39 version costs up to $ 75 per session and has an array of objects to destroy , including computers and office furniture			1
but the @entity10 alternative , housed in a refurbished garage , is much more basic			1
for $ 6 customers , who are required to wear protective gloves , glasses and a helmet , can smash a coat - rack , chair , bookshelf , and other items such as framed photographs , empty cans and plastic containers			1
after the destruction , they get to unwind with relaxing music , leaving the clean - up to staff			1
turned to rubble : the @entity2 's proprietors were inspired by a similar venture in @entity39 , @entity40 mess : the @entity2 , is housed in a former garage , and customer usually spend five minutes completing their destruction ' on average , we have one person a day , enough to keep us going , ' says @entity77 , an 18 - year - old who runs the room with a friend			1
' dozens have come so far , people of all ages			0
' he said that visitors , who have included a number of women , usually need about five minutes to destroy everything inside			1
while it may be an easy way to let off steam , experts warn that projects like this are no replacement for anger management therapy			0
@entity96 , a psychologist from @entity97 , said that modern science looks for ways to control frustrations before they explode into full - blown rage			0
she explained that ' venting anger does give you an immediate sense of relief but in the long run , one becomes accustomed to feeling angry '			0
preparation : @entity77 , who runs the company with a friend , arranges furniture and other household items before a demolishing session begins medically untested : a sign advertising the @entity2			2
after the session customers are given a cd that includes information about professional therapists and how to contact them ' in a stressful situation , one can count to ten , or take calm , deep breaths			1
it 's much more useful to practice yoga			0
' @entity77 said each visitor must sign a document that includes a clause saying the @entity2 does not aspire to offer medical assistance			0
after the session is over , customers are given a cd that includes information about professional therapists and how to contact them			2
after his session , panting customer @entity130 , 18 , says : ' this feels so good ! ' he adds : ' i feel i let go of all my negative energy			2
this last year was a tough one and i wanted to end it with a bang			0
' he said the session helped to take off some of the pressure that had built up in his studies - adding that many of his friends felt the same way			0
' this is better than getting into a fight , ' he concluded .			0
