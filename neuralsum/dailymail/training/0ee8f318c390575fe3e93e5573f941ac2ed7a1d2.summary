by @entity0 when my mobile rang at around 1am on a sunday , i knew instinctively that something was wrong			0
it was my sister , @entity6 , and the anguish in her voice confirmed my fears			1
her husband , @entity10 , had been rushed into hospital after developing severe chest pains			1
the outlook was not good and , unable to contact either of her daughters , @entity16 and @entity17 , who lived nearby with their partners , she pleaded with me to get hold of them			0
in the hours that followed , @entity17 made it to @entity23 to be with her father			2
then the decision was made to transfer @entity10 to the specialist vascular unit at the @entity27 in @entity28			1
@entity10 's sister @entity6 's husband , @entity10 , 57 , died following an abdominal aortic aneurysm during the 30 - mile journey his condition deteriorated further and paramedics battled to keep him alive			1
@entity10 's eldest daughter @entity16 managed to see him before he was rushed into theatre			1
we waited in the family room clinging to the hope that he would pull through , but it was not to be			0
i will never forget the outpouring of grief as the surgeon returned to tell us that @entity10 had died , just over five hours after first being admitted to hospital			1
he was 57 and the cause of death was a rupture of the aorta - the large artery that passes from the heart to the abdomen			1
it had burst because of an abdominal aortic aneurysm ( @entity56 ) - where a weak part of the artery starts to swell , causing it to bulge outwards like a balloon			1
eventually , the wall bursts open causing massive internal bleeding which can not be stemmed without immediate surgery			0
this can lead to the heart being starved of oxygen , which can be fatal			2
since his death on november 12 , 2006 , my family has struggled to come to terms with why @entity10 died so suddenly			1
he enjoyed good health and there were no signs that his life might end so abruptly			0
for my sister and her daughters , the loss of a wonderful husband and father has been devastating			1
he did at least live to see the arrival of his first grandchild - and he would have been overjoyed to see the arrival of four more			2
' it is said that of patients with a ruptured aaa , half will die before they reach hospital ' on birthdays , anniversaries and at @entity88 there is still a feeling that someone is missing			2
there is also the inevitable question as to whether or not he might still have been here if his condition had been diagnosed sooner			0
an abdominal aortic aneurysm can grow slowly over years			1
the aorta of a healthy person is as wide and as tough as a garden hose , so someone can live with a small aneurysm for years if it does not grow much			1
and as dr @entity102 , the @entity103 's associate medical director , explains : ' it usually causes no symptoms until it ruptures , which is a medical emergency , and often proves fatal			2
' aaas are responsible for nearly 6,000 deaths in @entity109 and @entity110 every year - with men over 65 being more at risk than women			1
the exact reason for this is not clear , but genetic factors are important and female hormones are thought to offer protection			1
because of hereditary influences anyone whose brother , sister or parent has had the condition could also be at risk			1
aneurysms may be exacerbated by the hardening of the arteries , due to things such as smoking , an unhealthy diet , and high blood pressure			2
@entity56 has an extremely high mortality rate , says dr @entity135 , a clinical lecturer in vascular surgery from the @entity137 at the @entity138			0
' it is said that of patients with a ruptured aaa , half will die before they reach hospital			2
and half of those who do reach hospital will die before they reach the operating theatre and then half of those who have an operation to repair the tear in the artery will not survive			1
' in march 2009 , @entity152 set up the @entity153 for all men reaching 65 , with identical programmes rolled out in stages across the rest of @entity158 from 2012			1
men over 65 , who have not previously been screened , can put themselves forward for the programme , too			1
uptake for the screening has been good - 76 per cent of the 226,901 men aged 65 invited for screening attended their appointments			1
a further 13,164 men above 65 referred themselves for screening			2
but with more than 2,627,000 men aged 65 to 74 in the @entity158 , according to the latest census , clearly more lives could be saved if those who do not qualify for screening self - referred			1
the screening test consists of a ten - minute ultrasound scan			0
at less than 3cm there is no concern , but an aneurysm measuring 3 to 4.4cm needs annual surveillance			0
this increases to three - monthly surveillance for measurements of 4.5 to 5.5cm			0
anyone with an aneurysm larger than 5.5cm is referred to the consultant vascular surgeon			0
anyone found to be at risk , that is with an aneurysm greater than 5.5cm in diameter , can then elect for surgical intervention			2
this involves replacing the affected part of aorta with a piece of synthetic tubing known as a graft - either via open surgery on the abdomen or fed up from the groin			1
as dr @entity102 says : ' it is better to manage things in a proactive way than to wait for a crisis			0
assuming a patient survives the ruptured aorta , you then have the awful pressure it puts on services in terms of the emergency trip to @entity212 before going into the ' resus ' room to try to repair the thing , all of which is extremely traumatic for patients , relatives and staff			0
' one man who ca n't speak highly enough of the process is @entity220 , from @entity221 , who had the ultrasound scan			0
' the machine beeped and as the measurements were taken the nurse 's expression changed			0
she said : “ i 'm afraid you have an aneurysm and it 's quite big - around 4.9cm			1
” within days i had an appointment with a consultant vascular surgeon at the @entity234			0
' aneurysms may be exacerbated by the hardening of the arteries , due to things such as smoking or bad diet told later that the aneurysm was 5.9cm and not 4.9cm he was given a choice of treatment - endovascular aneurysm repair ( @entity245 ) , which involves a synthetic graft being fed up through the arteries in the legs to repair the aorta or open surgery , which , unlike @entity245 , is a one - off procedure without further checks			1
he opted for the latter , despite a slightly higher mortality risk of 1 to 5 per cent			0
before his surgery , @entity220 agreed to take part in a trial of another , possibly more accurate screening method for @entity56			0
a magnetic resonance imaging ( @entity262 ) scanner , funded by the @entity103 and the @entity263 , is being put to use in a study of 350 patients at @entity234			0
this provides instant , real - time moving images of the inside of the body			0
it is being explored as a way to predict the risk of rupture and help surgeons decide which patients would benefit from preventative surgery , and possibly lead to even earlier intervention			2
the proportion of men screened who will be found to have an aneurysm @entity220 had the @entity262 before his initial assessment day and another on the day of assessment			2
he will have a follow up in two years to check for any changes			0
' @entity262 scanning is potentially more accurate but more difficult to do because it is an expensive piece of kit , ' says dr @entity102			0
' currently @entity56 screening can be done in any surgery setting without specialist equipment , so the challenge for the @entity152 would be a trade - off between something that is quick , easy and cheap and something that 's less accessible			2
' six days after his operation , @entity220 was allowed home			0
' for the first couple of weeks i spent a lot of time in bed feeling exhausted but i gradually got back to fitness through walking - starting slowly and increasing the distance each day			0
it has now been four months and i have started to play golf again and feel fine			0
' it is too late for @entity10 - and at 57 he was too young to have been offered screening - but if advances in screening techniques can lead to more outcomes such as @entity220 's , costs will , hopefully , become a secondary consideration			1

@entity10 : ' my sister @entity6 's husband , @entity316 , 57 , died after five hours in hospital '
he died due to rupture of the aorta - artery passing from heart to abdomen
it burst due to abdominal aortic aneurysm - swelling weak part of artery
aaas are responsible for nearly 6,000 deaths in @entity109 and @entity110 annually
men over 65 are more at risk ; female hormones thought to offer protection
