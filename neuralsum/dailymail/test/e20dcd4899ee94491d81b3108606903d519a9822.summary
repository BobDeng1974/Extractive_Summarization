@entity1 presidential candidate @entity0 has made a formal rotation of the @entity3 between the continents one of the key elements of his manifesto and says he can see a tournament being jointly hosted by several different nations			1
prince @entity9 , a current @entity1 vice-president from @entity10 , said he could envisage a @entity3 being played in different countries - or even in different confederations - in a similar way to @entity14 which is being played in 13 nations			1
in his manifesto , which he launched on monday , prince @entity9 has also warned against any decision on expanding the @entity3 from its current 32 countries , or a re-allocation of places , being taken for purely political reasons to try to drum up votes for the @entity1 presidency			1
prince @entity0 , a @entity1 presidential candidate , wants to see the @entity3 rotated between nations prince @entity9 , who aims to replace @entity24 ( right ) , warned against expanding the @entity3 from 32 teams prince @entity9 is standing for @entity1 president alongside former @entity28 and @entity29 player @entity27 he is standing against current president @entity24 , @entity30 from @entity31 and former @entity28 international @entity27			1
in terms of @entity3 rotation , prince @entity9 said the confederations should take turns hosting the tournament			1
' the principle is that it should be rotated among the confederations but it still has to be based on the best bids , ' he said			2
' but we have to be open - minded			0
i think it is also possible that two countries from different confederations could co-host the @entity3			1
look at @entity44 in 2020 - a number of different regions or countries could host the @entity3 - it 's in the past now but potentially the @entity48 could have had a @entity3 due to its close proximity			1
' @entity1 has announced it will make a decision on the allocation of @entity3 places at an executive committee meeting the day after the presidential election on may 29			1
prince @entity9 said much more consultation was needed before any decision should be made			2
he added : ' i am very hesitant about people playing politics with the most important flagship event of @entity1 and possibly of sport in the world			0
' we need to speak to all the stakeholders , including the sponsors			0
people are making promises to enlarge the @entity3 but in 2022 they are making the @entity3 shorter in terms of time frame			1
we can not end up with a situation where mistakes are made again			0
' prince @entity9 has also promised greater transparency , including making public the salary of the @entity1 president and executive committee members			2
he also believes that the minutes of @entity1 executive committee meetings should be made public			0
he also wants an investigation into how the @entity79 television rights for the @entity80 were awarded to @entity81 without a tender process or any discussion with the @entity1 executive committee			2
@entity1 secretary general @entity85 has said @entity1 ' did what it had to do ' to prevent any possible legal action from the broadcaster in relation to the 2022 rights after the @entity91 was moved to the winter			2
prince @entity9 , who insists there is a real appetite for change among @entity1 associations , said large sums of money for football had potentially been lost			0
' unfortunately i was not made aware of it and i have been trying to find out what is going on , ' he said			0
@entity30 ( right ) , from @entity31 , is the remaining presidential candidate ' something went wrong and we need to get to the bottom of it			0
' it needs to have a proper tendering process which is good practice in any organisation in the world			0
' we are talking about a large sum of money that future generations will potentially have lost because of decisions or misadministration taking place at the moment by people who will probably not be around at that time			0

prince @entity0 launched his election manifesto on monday
