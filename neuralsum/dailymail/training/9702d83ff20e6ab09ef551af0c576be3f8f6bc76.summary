by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity3 pitcher @entity2 was ejected for using pine tar less than two weeks after appearing to get away with using a foreign substance in another game against @entity7 , and the @entity7 beat @entity8 5 - 1 on wednesday night			1
pine tar is a sticky substance that baseball players will often put on the handles of their bats to improve grip			1
pitchers will use it for the same reason , particularly in cold weather			0
however , @entity20 rules say that a pitcher ca n't put any foreign substance on the ball because it can potentially make the ball move more when a pitcher throws a curve ball			1
so pitchers will often try and hide it			0
if they get caught , they are typically thrown out of the game - and that 's exactly what happened to @entity2			1
the right - hander was thrown out in the second inning when plate umpire @entity33 found the substance on the right side of @entity2 's neck after @entity7 manager @entity38 asked him to check			1
@entity2 walked from the mound without protest			2
busted : umpires caught @entity3 pitcher @entity2 ( left ) with pine tar on his neck both @entity2 and @entity33 said it was pine tar			1
' when it 's that obvious , something has got to be said , ' @entity38 explained after the game			2
' our awareness was heightened , given what we had seen in the past			0
' @entity3 general manager @entity54 said @entity2 and the organization were ' embarrassed			2
' @entity2 ( 2 - 2 ) had nothing on the right side of his neck in a photo of him on the mound in his tough first inning , when four of the first six batters reached on hits			2
he said he put it on to get a better grip on the ball			2
another photo taken in the second showed a shiny horizontal substance on his upper neck below his right ear			2
after @entity2 struck out the first two batters and had a 1 - 2 count on @entity74 , @entity38 talked to @entity33			2
the umpire went to the mound , looked at the ball then touched the substance on @entity2 's neck with his right index finger			1
then he gestured with that same finger , indicating @entity2 's ejection			1
got ya : umpire @entity33 determined that the substance on @entity2 's neck was pine tar , which is against the rules for pitchers @entity3 manager @entity88 called it ' an error in judgment ' and a ' little bump ' and ' poor judgment			1
' ' he had a hard time gripping the baseball			0
unknown to us , he put it on and went out there , ' @entity88 said			0
' it 's a young kid			0
i do n't think he 's trying to do anything , cheat			0
i think he 's just trying to go out there and compete			0
' the incident comes just two weeks after a ' suspicious substance ' was seen on @entity2 's right arm during another game against the @entity7			1
though it was never investigated by umpires , baseball analysts believe it was also pine tar			1
rule 8.02 ( b ) says a pitcher shall not ' have on his person , or in his possession , any foreign substance			1
for such infraction of this section the penalty shall be immediate ejection from the game			0
in addition , the pitcher shall be suspended automatically			0
' ' we will talk to the umpires tomorrow and review their report before taking any action , ' @entity20 spokesman @entity127 said			2
in recent suspensions of pitchers for pine tar , @entity137 's @entity136 was penalized eight games in 2012 , the @entity133 ' @entity132 10 days in 2005 and @entity135 ' @entity134 10 days in 2004			1
the suspensions of @entity132 and @entity134 were cut to eight days after they asked the players ' association to appeal , and @entity136 dropped his challenge with no reduction			0
obvious : @entity7 manager @entity38 said that when it 's as obvious as it was on @entity2 , he has to alert the umpires in @entity2 's previous start against the @entity7 , a 4 - 1 @entity3 win in @entity8 on april 10 , television cameras caught @entity2 with what appeared to be sticky pine tar on his hand on a cool night			1
@entity38 did n't see a photograph of @entity2 's hand until the fourth inning ; when @entity2 came out to warm up for the fifth , his hand was clean			1
@entity2 said the dark substance was dirt but it sparked debate about pitchers ' use of sticky substances to get a better grip on cool nights			1
on wednesday , with the game time temperature at 50 degrees , @entity74 started the first with a triple and scored on @entity172 's single			2
with one out , @entity173 singled @entity172 to third			0
after @entity176 flied to left , @entity175 singled up the middle , scoring @entity172			0
