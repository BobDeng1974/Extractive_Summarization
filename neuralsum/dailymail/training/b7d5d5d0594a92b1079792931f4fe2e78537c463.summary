a dozen cabinet ministers have been caught out ignoring @entity2 's ban on taking mobile phones into meetings			1
blackberries , iphones and other handsets were banned from @entity9 meetings in 2010 over fears they could be hijacked by foreign spies to listen in on top level discussions			1
but when security chiefs went to brief ministers on efforts to tackle cyber-terrorism , the prime minister was alarmed to find at least 12 had broken the rules			1
mobile phones are banned from meetings in the @entity9 room in @entity22 , but senior ministers were caught breaking the rules @entity2 ordered a phone ' amnesty ' for ministers to come clean about their secret phones before the @entity30 briefing could begin on tuesday , the head of the government 's eavesdropping agency @entity30 attended @entity9 at 10 @entity34 to brief ministers on cyber-security			1
director @entity37 was due to update senior ministers on progress in implementing the government 's @entity40			0
but when ministers were reminded that they should not have their phones in the room , many were forced to admit they were secretly trying to break the rules			2
@entity30 director @entity37 was due to update senior ministers on progress in implementing the government 's @entity40 mr @entity2 announced a ' phone amnesty ' , according to the @entity51			1
' he told the @entity52 and others present , that everyone had one minute to leave the room and dispense of any phones they had brought in			0
almost instantly , a dozen ministers guiltily rose to their feet , ' the newspaper added			1
@entity61 , who last month disrupted a @entity9 meeting when his email and text enabled - watch started playing a @entity66 song , also had to remove the gadget			0
some ministers had to hand in more than on phone , and only once the mobiles had been removed from the room could the briefing begin			1
the £ 860 million five - year @entity40 - which was published in 2011 - sets out measures to safeguard @entity75 's economic prosperity , national security and way of life by building a ' more trusted and resilient digital environment '			0
it aims to make the @entity75 one of the most secure places in the world to do business online , by tackling cyber crime , promoting resilience to cyber-attack and helping to shape an ' open , vibrant and stable ' cyberspace			0
@entity34 refused to discuss the content of mr @entity37 's briefing			0
but a spokesman did reveal that there was no discussion in @entity9 of the recent incident in which a hoax caller managed to speak to mr @entity2			2
@entity34 and the security services launched a major review of procedures following the breach , although mr @entity2 has said nobody would be sacked and no crime was committed			2
@entity61 , who last month disrupted a @entity9 meeting when his email and text enabled - watch started playing a @entity66 song , also had to remove the gadget before the meeting could start the @entity9 meeting as attended by health secretary @entity107 ( left ) and home secretary @entity108 , but it is unclear who had their mobile phones with them the prime minister revealed the call came after he returned from @entity115 to pay his respects after the death of @entity118 and he was enjoying a ' very nice walk ' with his family when his mobile rang			1
he said : ' i had @entity123 on my back to add to the exercise regime that i 'm undertaking			0
my @entity126 went in my pocket , i answered it and it claimed to be a conference call established – which i do obviously very frequently – between the head of @entity30 and some of the staff in my office			2
' a voice came through , a voice i did n't recognise			0
the voice said he said he was sorry to wake me up , which i thought was strange as it was eleven o'clock in the morning , and so i quite rapidly asked ' who is this ? ' , to which the answer came ' it is a hoax call ' , and so i pushed the red button on the @entity126 which ended the call			0
' that is what happened so no harm was done , no national security was breached , but it is important when these things happen to make sure we do everything we can to put in place systems to we weed out hoax calls , but every now and again , i suspect these things will happen '			0
the call followed a separate astonishing security lapse earlier in the day when a caller , believed to be the same man , was given a mobile number for @entity30 director mr @entity37 after he rang the organisation .			1
