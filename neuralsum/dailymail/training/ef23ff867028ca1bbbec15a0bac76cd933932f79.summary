@entity0 has admitted that @entity2 ’s inability to win matches they dominate could cost them dear by the end of the season			1
spurs ’ mental fragility as well as defensive lapses were all too evident at the @entity9 — even though they played some delightful football			2
the lead provided by @entity14 ’s second - minute goal lasted 74 seconds before @entity15 was allowed through to level			2
@entity17 restored the advantage only for team - mate @entity19 to lose concentration as the ball bounced off him for an own - goal equaliser			0
@entity19 looks on in despair as the ball ricochets off him for the own goal that denied @entity2 three points @entity17 celebrates putting @entity2 back in the lead early in the second half @entity0 is concerned that @entity2 can not see out games			1
he said : ‘ if it happens a lot then yes , it is worrying			0
the most frustrating thing is that we were n’t rewarded for our performance			0
if you play badly and draw then it is quite good , as i am sure the @entity38 players will tell you			1
their manager wo n’t be able to believe they came away with a point			1
’ of @entity2 ’s 15 shots , six were blocked , four saved , three were off target ( two hitting the woodwork ) , and two went in			1
@entity2 boss @entity46 said he needed to analyse what happened before commenting in detail on what went wrong			2
a lack of clinical finishing , some frantic @entity38 defending , a good display from host keeper @entity53 and some sloppy defending is what he ’ll find			2
‘ ( a draw ) is difficult to take after dominating the game , ’ @entity0 added			1
‘ but we will watch it again and see where we went wrong because when you have so much of a game and do n’t win , it means something has gone wrong			2
’ @entity46 ( left ) said he would look at a tape of the game before discussing where it went wrong @entity0 was annoyed at his side 's inability to finish off the game in which they dominated @entity15 conceded @entity2 were the better team			1
‘ they were very good for sustained periods , and we had to battle out there , ’ said the midfielder			0
‘ they did n’t cut us open all the time but had periods of possession in front of our box			0
we defended quite well , considering the pressure they put us under			0
we showed character to stay in the game and get a point			2
’ @entity15 ’s manager , @entity87 , who played 98 times for @entity2 between 2001 and 2004 , was delighted with a point — and rightly so			1
he said it had been a ‘ tough , tough day ’			0
@entity15 scored an excellent goal admitted that his side had been second best on the balance of play ‘ i think they ’ve got everything , ’ he said of @entity2			1
‘ on another day , they could have scored a couple of goals in a row and the game could have been over with 20 minutes left			0
but that ’s the difference between winning and not getting three points			0
‘ it comes down to little things , like in the last minute @entity17 not being on the pitch to take a free kick			0
' in the end , @entity107 ( @entity108 ) could have scored and imagine if we had taken all three points — spurs would have been devastated , but that ’s football			0
’ @entity38 manager @entity87 said if his team had stolen a winner @entity2 would have been devastated			1

@entity2 dominated the game but could *n't* secure three points
@entity2 twice took the lead but @entity38 *responded* to earn 2 - 2 draw
