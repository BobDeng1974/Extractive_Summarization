by @entity0 the last time i squeezed myself into a cut - out swimming costume was in 1970			1
i was 16 , at a beach party in @entity5			1
of course , back then i had an athletic , streamlined body — far superior to what you see today			2
the swimsuit was black , shiny , with gold hoops that barely held it together at the sides			2
there was also a slash sliced out of the front , exposing most of my youthful decolletage			2
i looked as slick as an otter but barely dared to move in case of a wardrobe malfunction			2
after a day of holding my breath , i resolved to stick to my usual bikinis			2
far easier and less nerve - racking			1
this summer , though , cut - out costumes are back with a vengeance in almost every @entity26 shop , including traditionally more staid stores such as @entity28 and @entity29			1
and unlike the precarious costumes of my youth , many claim to be secure as well as sexy , designed to bridge the gap between a bikini and a swimsuit			1
so could this new breed of cut - out cossies really be the solution for those 60 - somethings , like me , whose bikini days are behind them but who still want to look good on the beach ? @entity42 at @entity28 , £ 31.60 , debenhams.co.uk my , this looked terrifying — but once it was on , i loved it			1
the low neckline was rescued by a clever clasp , which held me all in but still looked marvellously racy			2
the cups also have removable padding — great if , like me , you have a generous bust			2
the cut - outs on the side are perfectly placed			1
the print offers a visually slimming effect from the front , and the bright green border around the chest adds shape and definition			2
wear - ability : 4/5 black bandage style , £ 30 , riverisland.com you need to be a contortionist to get into this			1
it looks like an outfit from @entity66 and got caught on my head , arms , legs and everything in between			2
the fabric was itchy , the material thick and unyielding and it provided no support — plus the tan lines would be unbearable			0
wear - ability : 0/5 red frilled , £ 32 , @entity77 oh dear			1
it ’s a lovely colour			0
this is for adolescents only : all frills and bows , and about as subtle as a sledgehammer			0
i look like a @entity89 wannabe			0
it ’s terribly unsupportive and i can only imagine that i would come spilling out of it badly while swimming			0
the body is far too long and it bags in places			0
it ’s shiny and cheap - looking , too			1
in short , i ’d take a wetsuit over this			0
wear - ability : 1/5 @entity99 and sheer , £ 185 , babajaancollection.com i feel surprisingly fabulous in this			1
it is n’t as revealing as i ’d feared because the mesh panelling covers the cut - out sections , but i still look sexy			1
the asymmetric top is flattering , yet glamorous			0
i feel like a @entity107 girl — i modelled for the opening credits of @entity109 in 1985 , so it takes me back			0
it also feels super-secure , though it might be marginally kinder in a darker shade			0
but what a shame it ’s so expensive			0
wear - ability : 5/5 black halterneck , £ 25 , next.co.uk i generally avoid black costumes , as the colour can wash out a mature woman ’s skin			1
@entity120 is much more flattering			0
but this is surprisingly elegant			0
i feel i should be sailing along the @entity122			0
the cut - outs are n’t so large that i feel overexposed , nor so tight that they dig in and cause nasty bulges			1
there ’s enough support for you to pull down the top straps and spare you some tan lines without revealing anything — and the leg cut is safe for us glamorous grannies			1
you ’d never know this was next and not a designer			0
wear - ability : 4/5 @entity137 print , £ 89 , johnlewis.co.uk the geometric print is wonderfully funky but the high leg is a bit unnerving			1
thankfully , there is ample coverage up top without exposing my cleavage , and inbuilt hidden cups support my substantial bust			0
the straps are adjustable and prettily tasselled at the back			0
it feels snug and secure but the side cut - outs were at a bad height for my muffin top , drawing attention to my bad bits			1
the edges dug in and pressed uncomfortably — and the tan marks from this would be horrific			0
wear - ability : 3/5			1

this summer cut - out costumes are in almost every @entity26 shop
the new breed of cossies claim to be secure as well as sexy
are cut - outs the solution for those whose bikini days are behind them ?
