@entity0 gave his humiliated @entity2 stars the silent treatment following their shock @entity5 loss to @entity7			1
the @entity8 were left shell - shocked after relinquishing a 2 - 0 lead to concede four against the @entity11 side			1
@entity0 headed into the @entity7 dressing room to congratulate @entity14 's side following their historic victory			1
@entity0 did not say a word to his @entity2 players after their @entity5 defeat by @entity7 @entity7 's players celebrate after dumping @entity2 out of the @entity5 at the fourth round stage 4 - @entity7 became the fourth opponents to score four goals against a team coached by @entity0 after @entity24 ( 2010 , 0 - 5 ) , @entity25 ( 2013 , 1 - 4 ) and @entity26 ( 2015 , 3 - 5 )			1
the @entity27 are the first team ever to do it away from home			2
2008 - the last time @entity2 lost to a lower league team in the @entity5 was against @entity30 in 2008			1
@entity31 has scored four goals and assisted four in his last five @entity5 games			2
1 - this is the first time @entity2 have conceded more than two goals at home this season in all competitions			1
£ 7,500 - striker @entity39 is the only @entity7 player to command a fee , £ 7,500			1
in contrast , @entity2 ’s starting line - up cost a whopping £ 101million			1
10 - @entity0 ’s side have conceded 10 goals in 2015 — only four teams in the @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity11 and @entity48 have let in more in the same period			1
former @entity2 winger @entity49 has scored three goals and provided two assists in his last five @entity5 games for @entity7			1
1958 - @entity2 conceded four goals to a third - tier team for the first time since 1958 , when they lost 4 - 1 to @entity56 — the goals coming from @entity58 ( two ) , @entity59 and @entity60			1
but his mood towards his own players was far less complimentary			2
' what did i say to the players ? nothing			2
not a word , ' said @entity0			1
' it was n't a moment to speak to them			0
' instead , @entity0 used sunday 's scheduled warm down training session at the club 's @entity72 to begin the inquest into the defeat			1
the @entity2 manager was at his desk by 8am on sunday ahead of his players ' arrival			1
his first priority was to ensure there is not a lingering hangover following saturday 's embarrassing loss with tomorrow 's @entity84 semi-final second leg clash against @entity86 looming			1
' i do n't think they played poorly — the way they arrived to 2 - 0 looked quite comfortable			2
the goal they scored after forty something minutes got them into the game and after that there are things difficult to explain			2
' goals we missed , goals we concede			0
do i blame myself for this ? ( i blame myself ) the same as the players			2
i think we should share between us			0
but if i am the boss , the boss has more responsibilities			0
' maybe the players switched off after going 2 - 0 up			1
but at half - time it was 2 - 1 and then we spoke about the danger of the situation			2
we spoke about how they play , we repeated at half - time what we spoke in the preparation of the match			0
' maybe you do n't believe but we prepared in the same way we prepare for a @entity46 match , the same power point presentation , same analysis , the same information , we prepare exactly the same way			0
' we respect them — at least i respect them — in the way we prepared for the game but at half - time the players thought ' we are going to score , not them ' and when they scored for 2 - 2 , after that the game became crazy			1
' @entity2 captain @entity131 was left on the bench but @entity0 's insists his side did n't miss his leadership @entity0 is now preparing to face @entity86 after drawing 1 - 1 in the first leg of the @entity84 semi-final without key - defensive trio @entity131 , @entity137 and @entity138 , who were all rested , the @entity8 struggled to stem the flow of @entity7 's second - half momentum			1
but @entity0 insists he still has faith in his squad despite losing			2
' did we miss @entity131 's leadership ? no , ' said the @entity145			0
' we played lots of games without @entity131			0
we played almost every @entity5 game without @entity131			1
we played @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 without @entity131 and the team coped well with the situation			0
' i trust my squad			0
it is not because of this disappointment and this bad performance that i am going to change			0
@entity2 's players are left dejected after @entity7 staged a stunning comeback to progress in the @entity5 @entity162 ( right ) celebrates making it 2 - 2 as @entity164 and @entity165 look on helplessly ' it is easy for you to understand now why i play almost every game with the same players			1
i do n't make many changes			0
' i try to keep stability in the team			0
maybe now you can understand a bit better why			0
i do n't want to speak too much about it			0
this is my squad — let 's move on			0
' this result does n't alter may plans in the transfer market			0
i 'm happy to go with the squad i have			0
this is @entity2 always thinking and being proud of thinking of numbers and @entity184 and so on			2
' we can not now go to the market and spend money			0
i am completely with the club			0
i do n't think we are going to the market , unless someone makes a market with us			0
