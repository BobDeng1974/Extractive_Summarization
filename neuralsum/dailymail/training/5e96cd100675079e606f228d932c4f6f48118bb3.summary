a woman who tried to rescue the life of a dying dog has lashed out at the animal 's owner			1
@entity5 , of @entity6 , @entity7 , was driving her car a little after 10pm on february 13 when she narrowly missed hitting a dog as he ran across the darkened , and busy , road			1
seconds later , a car behind her did hit the dog , and that is when @entity5 stopped what she was doing and leaped into action			1
' @entity31 we have to do something , pick it up get it help			0
' that is when she and a friend loaded the animal into her truck and took it to the vet where , after a four hour operation and $ 800 bill that @entity5 paid out of her own pocket , the dog ultimately had to be put down			1
making matters worse was the fact that the dog had neither a collar , tags or a microchip to help in locating the owner			1
' he was suffering , he was in a lot of pain			0
it was a very tough decision			0
we all cried , my friend cried , her daughter sobbed			0
i petted him and held his head while they did it			0
i made sure i was there so he was n't alone , ' said @entity5			1
when she got home however , she got on @entity68 and turned that sadness into rage at the ' irresponsible @entity71 ' that in her opinion was to blame for this tragedy			0
' through your irresponsibility i had to become responsible for your dogs health and future			0
i did n't ask for that responsibility nor did i want it , but you failed your dog , ' she wrote			1
' i cried over your dog for an hour while i struggled to make a decision based on what was best for a dog i 'd only just met when i was scraping him off the asphalt a few hours earlier			1
' ' you did n't deserve him			1
you may have had him first , but he was my dog when his heart stopped beating , ' said @entity5 she ended by saying ; ' i 'll never even know his name , but i loved him because you failed him			1
he should have been growing up safe , healthy , and warm at home , not scared and running through busy roads at night			2
he did n't deserve that , none of them do			1
and you did n't deserve him			1
you may have had him first , but he was my dog when his heart stopped beating			1
' it is still not known who owned the dog			2
dear @entity103 , is this your dog ? some kids told me he lived on @entity107 , tomball , off @entity108			0
i know it 's hard to tell what he looks like through the blood on his face and since he 's all wrapped up and strapped down			0
in case you are wondering where he went , he died in my arms on @entity119 at 1:16 am			0
in case you care , which i doubt , he was running across @entity108 ( the busiest road in tomball with a 55mph speed limit ) at 10pm friday the 13th			1
i barely missed hitting him with my truck , but turned around to make sure he got help to safety			1
in those 30 seconds it took me to turn my truck around , someone hit him			0
i thought he was dead in the @entity132 until he lifted his head			0
no one stopped but me			0
the same kids that told me he lived on @entity107 , kids that were too young to be out past dark wandering the streets , had scared him back into the road and watched him get hit			1
they obviously knew the dog , and it seemed intentional if you ask me			0
i pulled into the @entity132 and my friend and i wrapped him in my jacket and put him with her in the backseat where she comforted him all the way to the @entity152 while he bled all over my $ 70,000 truck			1
but your dog was more important to me than my interior			0
in case you care , your dog was a complete sweetheart even though he was in enormous pain due to your negligence			0
i then spent the next 4 hours in the @entity152 with your dog			2
he had a severely broken leg and bruised , swollen , fluid filled lungs , in case you were wondering			0
again , just in case you were wondering , i know about the leg that was broken through the growth plate and about the lung damage ( oh yeah , ca n't forget the head trauma also ) because of the 400ish dollars i spent on radiographs for your dog			2
and of course he had no tags or identification of any kind so i became responsible for your dogs life and the $ 780 final vet bill for him			1
the vet also informed me he was only about 8 months old , by the way			0
through your irresponsibility i had to become responsible for your dogs health and future			0
i did n't ask for that responsibility nor did i want it , but you failed your dog			2
i sat with your dog for hours going through diagnostics trying to determine if he could recover			2
i petted your dog and comforted him so he did n't feel abandoned			2
i cried over your dog for an hour while i struggledto make a decision based on what was best for a dog i 'd only just met when i was scraping him off the asphalt a few hours earlier			2
i had to be strong enough to say the words and tell the vet to euthanize your dog and end his suffering			2
i sobbed while i tried to let him know that i loved him and i was there for him when you were n't , and i held his head until he took his last breath			0
i 'll never even know his name , but i loved him because you failed him			0
he should have been growing up safe , healthy , and warm at home , not scared and running through busy roads at night			0
he did n't deserve that , none of them do			1
and you did n't deserve him			1
you may have had him first , but he was my dog when his heart stopped beating			1
sincerely , a responsible dog owner			2

@entity5 of @entity6 , @entity7 was driving on february 13 when she narrowly missed hitting a dog on a busy road after 10pm
the car behind her did hit the dog , so she immediately got out , loaded the dog into her car and took it to the vet
after four hours and an $ 800 bill she paid , the dog , who had no tags , collar or microchip , had to be put down
@entity5 then wrote a *scathing* letter to the unknown owner about how they did not deserve the dog
' you did n't deserve him . you may have had him first , but he was my dog when his heart stopped beating , ' said @entity5
