these are the extraordinary century - old panoramic pictures taken by @entity2 cameramen who risked their lives to gather intelligence during the @entity5			1
the surveillance images , hailed as some of the most important photographs of the conflict , show never - before - seen views of @entity12 and important battle sites taken from the trenches of the @entity14			1
they were taken at huge risk by fearless cameramen - who would lean out of the trenches with crude glass plate equipment to take the images			1
a collection of panoramic images taken by brave @entity2 gathering intelligence during the @entity5 has been revealed			1
these two images show the same view of @entity26 at the @entity27 99 years apart			2
the location was one of the bloodiest of the entire conflict - and on 1 july 1915 , thousands of @entity31 were cut down at the spot			2
today the landscape shows nothing of the horrors it once witnessed the images were taken by @entity2 cameramen - who risked their lives to take the pictures			1
this image shows @entity42 troops moving through the ruins of the - once beautiful city of @entity45			2
by the time this photograph was taken in april 1918 , the war was nearing its end - evident by the devastation that is depicted in this behind - the - scenes image , lieutenant @entity49 and his assistant prepare to take a picture from a front line trench in the @entity54 sector in @entity55 - a hugely difficult task that would have seen them go over the top of the trench			2
he used a tripod - mounted 5 x 4 inch @entity61 camera fitted with a telephoto lens to take the shots at the time , the panoramas were highly classified because of the information they would have given the enemy			1
each was printed with the following warning : ' this panorama is to be kept with as much security as is compatible with full advantage of it being taken by our own troops			0
' some of the photographs show the tranquil countryside in the early days of the war , apparently unspoilt but with the enemy positions carefully marked			1
others graphically portray the obliteration to the landscape and towns after years of bloody attrition			0
the images are printed in a new book called @entity87 by @entity88			1
these panoramas show the development of defensive positions at the somme			0
the first was taken in may 1915 and shows a simple fortification known as a breastwork - which were usually built on the surface and made from sandbags and wood			0
the second shows the same scene 18 months later in november 1916 and the dramatic increase in fortifications this image shows the @entity104 sector , one of the most blood - drenched corners of the entire @entity14			1
the image was taken from the heart of the once sylvan and tranquil @entity109 estate in @entity110 this image shows the aftermath of conflict at @entity113 , @entity114			0
a long line of soldiers carry duckboards towards new positions and use them to cross the mud and flooded shell craters on the tortured ground in his foreword , tv historian @entity121 says : ' it is wonderful to see these panoramas , unexploited for so long , in print			0
' they provide a strong fulcrum for our understanding of the war , for they enable us to link personal accounts and official records to the all - important ground on which battles were fought			0
' and , at a human level , they put us eye - deep in hell , looking out across a landscape so familiar to that generation whose endurance and achievement lift my spirits and break my heart			0
' this dramatic image shows behind the battle lines during the @entity113 in 1917			0
by this point , the war was about to enter its fourth year and the landscapes were devastated almost beyond recognition an image dated april 1915 shows hill 60 - an important landmark near @entity45			0
the photograph shows how close enemy lines were - with the @entity157 holding the vital upper ground on @entity159			2
it also shows some of the black humour that existed - with one part of the @entity2 trenches ironically nicknamed @entity164 this view is the @entity167 front in july 1915 , a year before the hell of what became the worst battle in @entity2 military history			1
it shows pastures virtually unmarked by shelling , with leafy and shady woods and copses and buildings of all kinds still standing			0
