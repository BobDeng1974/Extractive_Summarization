sergeant @entity0 was only 26 when he died at @entity1 in 1917 with the @entity1 raging around him , sergeant @entity0 - dying from a fatal wound - clutched a picture of his family			1
on the back , he had written his dying wish , that someone would return it to his wife			1
he would have hoped one of his comrades would fulfil the request , it ca n't have crossed his mind that it would be honoured by an enemy - let alone the one who had killed him			2
however , this is the incredible story that has come to light now the soldier 's grandaughter has unearthed the photograph among her father 's belongings			1
@entity23 , 58 , has uncovered the black and white photo almost 100 years after it was taken			1
it pictures the soldier with his wife , @entity27 , and son - mrs @entity23 's father - @entity28			1
along with the photograph , mrs @entity23 found the devastating telegram that informed her grandmother of her husband 's death and a letter from the @entity38 soldier , explaining the picture 's incredible journey from the @entity41 back to mrs @entity23 in @entity43 , @entity44			1
mrs @entity23 , whose late father was only three when his @entity46 died , said : ' my father barely knew his father but he had these items in a box			2
' the box has been passed down to me and in it were these letters by the @entity38 soldier and the @entity56 explaining the return of the photo to my grandmother in 1917			1
photograph taken on the same occasion as the one returned by the @entity38 soldier			1
( @entity63 row , left to right ) unknown , @entity0 , brother @entity65 ( front row ) @entity27 with son @entity28 and @entity27 's mother mrs @entity66 a translation of the letter sent by @entity69 to the @entity56 the letter sent by the @entity56 to @entity71 along with her husband 's photograph ' it was this @entity38 soldier who probably killed my grandfather in an act of war			1
' he did n’t have to take the time out and maybe risk punishment to fulfil my grandfather ’s wishes			2
he could have left it there			2
' the two men did n’t know each other but it was very kind of him to do what he did for a fellow soldier			1
' the @entity38 who recovered the poignant image from @entity46 's body was @entity92 is an army rank for enlisted soldiers equivalent to a private			1
in a remarkable act of humanity , @entity96 sent the photo to the @entity56 in @entity100 along with a forwarding note			1
he wrote : ' he was holding the card in his hand and the finder was asked to forward it to his wife			2
@entity109 , wishing to fulfil the last will of the dead comrade , send it to you			0
' may he rest in peace			0
' @entity0 , far right , pictured with his fellow soldiers in the @entity114 a recent photograph of the area where @entity46 received his fatal wound however , in a sad twist , by carrying out the stranger ’s final wish , @entity96 may have deprived @entity46 of a war grave for his family to visit			1
the photo would have been a key item that would have helped identify his body			1
it is thought @entity46 was instead buried in an unmarked grave in @entity128			0
@entity46 served in the @entity114 and trained troops in rifle practice before being sent to the @entity41 in december 1916			0
in july 1917 , the men took part in a major dawn offensive in the @entity1 , known as @entity1			0

the letter that officially informed @entity71 of her husband 's death			1
his body has never been found the next morning his battalion were at @entity143 at @entity128 and came under heavy machine gun fire which caused them to conduct a fighting withdrawal			2
@entity46 was shot in the side and fell into the shell hole			0
until now , @entity46 's family have not known the details of his death but , with the help of the @entity155 project , set up to mark the centenary of the @entity157 , mrs @entity23 has been able to fill in the blanks			1
as a result of her coming forward with the documents , researchers for the @entity161 team have uncovered an eye - witness account of @entity46 's death			1
in 1918 , a private @entity166 told the @entity167 : ' we went over the top together at @entity143 front			0
' i did not see him ( @entity0 ) hit but several other fellows did			0
he was hit in the side and fell into a shell hole			0
he was too severely wounded to move			0
' he showed me a photo of his wife and child the night before			0
on the back of it he had written his wife ’s address and the words ‘ whoever finds this please forward ’ , or words like that			0
' we never saw him again and his body was never found			2
' mrs @entity23 said : ' all the family knew was that my grandfather was missing in action and then confirmed as killed in action			2
' his body has never been found and we have never really known what happened to him until now			2
' we still do n’t know where he is , only that he is buried out there somewhere			0
' i just wish my father was still alive today because he would have wanted to know			0
' @entity200 , of the @entity202 project , said : “ we are covering 20,000 different stories and this one stood out because it was an incredible moment of humanity in the carnage of war			0
“ it was right in the thick of the action and this one @entity38 soldier took it upon himself to do a dying comrade this remarkable favour			1
” @entity46 was aged 26 when he was killed			0
