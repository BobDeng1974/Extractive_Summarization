by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:43 est , 7 november 2012 updated : 17:48 est , 7 november 2012 @entity2 arrives at the @entity3 in @entity4 yesterday the head of the original inquiry into sexual abuse of boys at children ’s homes in @entity11 says he does not recall any of them claiming politicians had preyed on them			1
@entity15 said yesterday he had no memory of ex-resident @entity2 making the claim , first aired on @entity18 , of being raped by a senior @entity20 - era @entity19 when he spoke to him in the mid- 1990s			1
his resulting report uncovered widespread sex abuse by staff at several homes but was controversially pulped amid allegations of a cover - up			2
in 2000 , a government - commissioned public inquiry confirmed that hundreds of young boys had been systematically abused , centred on the now - notorious @entity2 home			2
but mr @entity33 ’s claims this week prompted @entity34 to order new inquiries into whether links to a wider paedophile ring potentially involving politicians were suppressed			1
as mr @entity15 cast doubt on mr @entity33 ’s account , two brothers who were at @entity2 at the same time as him told the @entity42 that claims of boys being taken away to be abused by outsiders were untrue			1
mr @entity15 , now 78 and long - retired as director of social services in @entity48 , was commissioned by @entity50 council in 1994 to examine claims of abuse at 40 homes across @entity11			1
he told @entity54 ’s @entity55 at one programme he did not recall mr @entity33 or other ex-residents claiming politicians had taken them to a hotel in nearby @entity60 and abused them			1
‘ my memory may be fading but i do n’t remember that was one of the issues he raised with us , ’ he said			0
asked whether he had heard claims by victims of abuse by a leading @entity70 politician who is still alive , mr @entity15 replied : ‘ not to the best of my knowledge			2
‘ i ’m sure that would have lodged in my mind and we would have wanted to investigate it had we known about it			0
’ alleged abusers named to him ‘ did n’t include well - known people in public life ’ , he added			0
the former @entity2 boys home , @entity60 , which closed down following claims of child abuse on tuesday an unnamed former resident of @entity2 said he saw the late sir @entity86 – a former close aide to @entity20 who died in 1995 – visit the home several times in the 1980s and take boys away in his car			1
but brothers @entity91 and @entity93 , who were at @entity2 at the same time as mr @entity33 and now live in @entity94 , rejected the claims			1
@entity93 , 45 , said : ‘ we were abused on a regular basis by staff , from beatings to molestation , and it was happening to many of the boys			0
‘ but the idea of smartly - dressed guys turning up in flash cars and picking us up is just a figment of someone ’s imagination			2
’ @entity91 , 44 , added : ‘ the notion that some shadowy figures would turn up at the gates in sports cars and take boys to be raped is just farcical			0
this simply did not happen			0
’ mr @entity33 – who plans to make a formal complaint against the former @entity19 grandee to the new @entity120 investigation – arrived at @entity2 in 1977 and is understood to have been there for three years			1
last night he refused to confirm the date he left but claimed not to have been there at the same time as the @entity93 brothers			0
‘ i do n’t care what they saw , ’ he told the @entity42			0
‘ i was n’t there then			0
’ he said critics were trying to discredit him .			0

@entity15 said he had no memory of ex-resident @entity2 making the claim of being raped by a senior @entity20 - era @entity19
but mr @entity33 ’s claims this week prompted @entity34 to order new inquiries into @entity11 abuse
