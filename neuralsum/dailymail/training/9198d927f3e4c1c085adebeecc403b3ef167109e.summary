being told i could never see my toddler grandson again , would make me feel as though my heart had been plucked out of my chest			2
yet i have received more than 250 letters from grandparents who are suffering that agony now			1
they tell me it ’s like a living bereavement and they think about their grandchildren every day			1
the greatest agony they feel is the worry that those children may not know how deeply they are loved and missed			1
these desperate letters were written to me after i made a film for @entity19 ’s @entity18 exposing the misery of grandparents denied access to their grandchildren			1
tonight i will be revisiting the subject , for the same programme			1
many grandparents suffer the agony of not seeing their grandchildren ( picture posed by models ) i first met @entity30 in january , when i visited the @entity31 ’ @entity32 she has set up to help others in this predicament			1
she has not seen her own granddaughter for seven years			1
in her home i met a group of dignified older men and women , all of them suffering , many of them in tears , as they talked about their loss			1
@entity30 remembers with frightening clarity the seven - year - old grandchild she adores running down the path away from her after a visit , blue eyes shining , ‘ a smile as broad as the @entity50 as she waved goodbye ’			1
that was the last @entity30 saw of her			1
her son had been though a difficult divorce and the girl ’s mother wanted to distance herself from her husband ’s family			1
her decision left @entity30 and her husband @entity60 brokenhearted			1
why do these rifts happen ? often , as in @entity30 ’s case , it ’s the result of a divorce or a family feud			1
sometimes it ’s simply an incautious word , a tactless remark that leads to a row			2
often grandparents tell me they simply have no idea why they have been cut off			1
@entity73 , 65 , with wife @entity30 61 , at home in @entity75			1
they have set up a group for grandparents who are denied access to their grandchildren the most tragic cases occur when one parent dies , and the surviving parent stops contact			1
@entity85 , a grandmother who lives in @entity86 , wrote to me : ‘ last year my daughter died of breast cancer aged 40			0
i had a loving relationship with my grandchildren			1
my daughter ’s wishes were for me and my husband to love and watch out for her children after she died			0
‘ she feared her husband would stop contact			0
unfortunately , she was right			0
as soon as she died , her husband pushed us out of the children ’s lives			0
’ it is not uncommon for a surviving partner to be so grief - stricken they can not bear anything that reminds them of their loss — and that may include any contact with the surviving family			1
‘ my granddaughter , who ’s four , is mystified where her mummy and grandparents have gone , ’ says @entity85			1
‘ when my daughter died it was a double loss — you have the loss of your daughter to deal with , and the loss of contact with your grandchildren			1
’ i remember my beloved 7 - year - old grandchild running down my path , waving goodbye			1
that 's the last time i saw her @entity30 another grandmother who wrote to me , @entity126 , has not seen her granddaughter for three years after a family upset that she did not want to repeat in detail			1
even her letters and presents to her granddaughter were returned			1
‘ it hurts so much when i have to ask someone to try to search for a photo on @entity135 , which i cling on to as i have nothing else , ’ she says			0
‘ my grandchild will be nine this october and probably does n’t even remember me			0
she might well think i am dead			0
i just want a hug , a cuddle			0
and the ability to share some family history and stories that would be so lovely to pass on to the next generation			1
’ she wrote of feeling ashamed that she could not keep her family together and of being desperate for even the tiniest scrap of @entity147 grandparents who wrote to me have even attempted suicide			1
@entity150 , who lives in @entity151 , told me her relationship with her son had been strained while he was growing up and when he married he cut off all contact with her			0
when she heard from friends that he had a baby son , she was desperate to meet her only grandchild			0
after she sent a note to her son , asking if they could be reconciled , she was visited by the police warning her away from her son and his new family which left her sobbing			1
she was so distraught that she attempted to take her own life			0
thankfully , she survived and now helps and encourages other grandparents who are also suffering			1
@entity150 keeps a memory box into which she puts little presents to celebrate milestones in her grandson ’s life : brightly - wrapped birthday presents , @entity174 cards			1
‘ last year he was three and so we bought him a @entity182 card with a number “ 3 ” on it and a @entity182 t - shirt , they are all wrapped up in his special box			1
three years of love inside the box			1
’ it can happen to anyone			0
the wife of one distinguished professor of psychology wrote to me : ‘ a lot of the time , the grandparents have no idea what the problem is			1
it feels like we are just something to be thrown away and forgotten			0
we are not even important enough to talk to , let alone have a relationship with			0
‘ it ’s really hard when others show us pictures of their grandchildren			1
that just stirs it all up			0
i wish there were some way to get across to the parents not only the pain they are causing the grandparents but what they are doing to their kids			1
’ there are 14 million grandparents in @entity214 , according to the @entity214 @entity215 the impact on the grandchildren , innocent pawns in an adult war , leaves scars			1
many of the letters i receive are from adults who were caught up in this as children			2
@entity226 , 27 , told me he is only just getting to know his grandmother , and still does n’t understand why conflict has shattered his family			2
‘ something happened when i was younger that stopped me from seeing them , ’ he said			0
‘ neither i , nor my grandparents know what happened			2
i met my fiancée three years ago and she has allowed me to gain enough confidence to meet them , much to my mother ’s displeasure			2
‘ my grandad was severely ill with cancer and sadly passed away in january			0
now i ’m living with deep regret that i never really got to know him			0
the few times i met him were amazing			0
i am still going to visit my @entity243 and am so happy that i am finding about my family , i just wish i had done it sooner			2
’ @entity246 , 29 , was stopped from seeing his grandparents when he was a child			2
he was never able to discover from his parents what caused the rift			0
‘ my grandmother died when i was 12			0
we were not allowed to go to her funeral , ’ he says			0
‘ i remember my grandfather tried the legal route and found he had no rights whatsoever			0
‘ he died when i was 16 and again we were not allowed to attend the funeral			0
i remember asking my mum if i could see him before he died			0
as a child you are powerless to insist that you see your grandparents			2
’ sadly many grandparents do not get to have joyful memories of spending time with their grandchildren ( pictures posed by models ) what can be done to heal this pain ? the law seems inadequate to protect the innocent , be they grandparents or grandchildren			1
@entity275 , from @entity276 , says : ‘ i ’m sad to admit it was my own daughter who , months after a new man entered her life , suddenly cut contact , not only with me but also with her brother			0
i not only lost a daughter but our granddaughter as well			2
‘ she refused to partake in professional mediation			0
@entity288 passed , as grandparents time is not on our side [ my husband is in remission from cancer ]			2
our final attempts were met by our daughter making a claim of harassment against us , this meant we could not phone , email or try to stay in touch			0
panic set in ! what if they moved ? would our granddaughter forget us ? ‘ fearful at never seeing our granddaughter again we decided , without legal representation , to apply to the courts for a contact order			2
this involved a nine - month ordeal of three court hearings , where we were made to feel we were on trial			2
‘ we had to prove we had played a large part in our granddaughter ’s life			2
thankfully , our granddaughter was interviewed and wrote a letter to the judge saying she very much wanted to see us and stay with us again			2
eventually , in october 2013 we were granted an order of contact , we were relieved and excited			0
‘ alas , we still have n’t seen or spoken with our granddaughter as our daughter is ignoring the order			2
’ @entity320 explores the issue on @entity18 so even the child ’s heartfelt wishes were ignored			1
there have been discussions about strengthening the law			0
in @entity329 , for instance , the law is clear that every child has the legal right to access to their grandparents			2
in this country it is a gruelling process and enormously costly , anything from £ 5,000 to £ 50,000			0
but it can achieve miracles			0
@entity337 , 55 , from @entity338 , decided to seek legal help after her daughter stopped her seeing her seven - year - old grandson			2
it worked and as a result she now sees him for seven hours every fortnight			0
‘ i look forward to those saturdays , like a kid looking forward to getting sweeties , ’ she says			0
‘ the moment i first saw him again , after 18 months , and he ran into my arms shouting “ @entity243 ! ” it was so nice just to cuddle him and be with him			0
’ no all grandparents are perfect , of course , but for most their happiness is in the hands of the parents			2
forget the feuding adults , the most important casualties in these wars are always the children .			0
