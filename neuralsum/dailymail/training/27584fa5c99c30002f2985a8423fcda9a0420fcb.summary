@entity1 defender @entity0 has been hit with a three match ban and £ 50,000 fine for backing @entity5 's controversial ' quenelle ' celebration last season			1
with the gesture known to have anti-semitic connotations , the punishment is particularly embarrassing for the @entity11 star given @entity1 ' strong @entity13 heritage			2
@entity5 , playing for @entity14 at the time , made the gesture having scored against @entity17 on december 28 - with the @entity14 sacking the striker following their own internal investigation			1
videos scroll down to watch ... @entity0 has been hit with three - game ban by the @entity22 and fined £ 50,000 @entity5 was hit with an £ 80,000 fine and banned for five matches following his ' quenelle ' gesture @entity0 was charged by the @entity22 after sending a tweet to @entity5 congratulating him on the gesture and , despite the 30 - year - old 's denial of wrongdoing , has been punished			1
the left - back insisted he was congratulating @entity5 from an anti-establishment viewpoint			1
and mr @entity34 , the chairman of the @entity35 that heard @entity0 's concurred , saying : ' even though we have found that there was an aggravated breach of @entity39 we are satisfied that when the @entity42 sent the tweet on the 28th december 2013 congratulating @entity5 , in his mind he believed he was congratulating @entity5 on what he perceived to be an anti-establishment gesture as opposed to one associated with anti-semitism			1
' in a statement from @entity0 , he added : ' i am obviously very pleased that the @entity22 has accepted i am not an anti-semite			1
i have always said that when i tweeted @entity5 i was congratulating him on an anti-establishment gesture and not on an anti-semitic gesture			1
' the finding against me was that i breached the @entity22 's rules but that my breach was unintentional			2
i have always loved the fans of @entity1 and i want to assure them that i would never knowingly behave in a racist or anti-semitic manner			2
' meanwhile , @entity58 have launched a formal investigation into the anti-semitic banner that overshadowed @entity1 's 0 - 0 draw against @entity62 on thursday night			1
@entity65 's @entity64 , playing against @entity63 , escaped with a warnings for a similar incident a banner that read : ' only jews and @entity71 ' - a play on comedy show @entity68 - was on display amongst @entity62 fans			1
the banner was included in @entity79 referee @entity77 's and the @entity58 match delegate 's reports on friday morning			2
@entity82 understands @entity62 officials were made aware of the banner by @entity58 officials during the game , but the @entity89 club 's failure to act is believed to have angered @entity92 football 's governing body			0
@entity58 are also concerned at how the large banner was allowed to be taken into the stadium by home supporters			0
it now looks highly likely @entity62 will face punishment from @entity58 , with a partial ground closure for their next @entity99 home clash and fine a possible sanction			0
the matter will be decided by @entity58 's disciplinary committee during their next meeting on october 16			0
@entity105 's @entity104 served a two - game ban and was fined £ 15,000 having also given his support to @entity5 @entity62 moved quickly to apologise for the offensive banner with a statement , that read : ' the football match between @entity62 and @entity1 was eagerly awaited in our city and we watched fine performances from both teams in a fair - play sporting atmosphere			1
' but this game was marred by malicious act of certain individuals who made all the efforts from our players and our club to prove we deserve our spot in football @entity92 worthless			0
' @entity62 resolutely disavows with anti-semitic banner displayed yesterday			0
the message displayed on that banner is completely opposite to preferences and opinions of almost all citizens of @entity89 and @entity62 fans			2
' it is absolutely absurd to link a club that was founded after the @entity134 on anti-fascist principles and after the battle of people of @entity92 with anti-semitism and similar dark and anti-civilisation impulses			0
' we fully condemn perpetrators of this mindless act , not only of anti-semitic nature , but one that represents hatred of @entity62 and @entity89 as well			0
" we believe this vicious action will not spoil our sporting friendship with @entity1 and football aficionados in @entity149			0
in cooperation with competent authorities , @entity150 will do everything to locate , trial and ban those perpetrators from sporting fields			0
' we apologise to everyone who found themselves insulted and upset by this banner			0
once again , we point out that such banner message is completely opposite to history and tradition of our club , and our fans ' aspirations			2

@entity0 sent the message to @entity5 on december *29* following his celebration after scoring against @entity17
@entity5 , playing for @entity14 at the time , was sacked following an internal investigation - he was also banned for five games and fined £ 80,000
@entity0 deleted the tweet which was *written* in @entity175 slang
in @entity178 it translated to : ' i congratulate you on the *beautiful* quenelle '
