by @entity0 villagers were plagued by rats after they broke free from an overcrowded cage to escape horrific neglect by their owner - who was reportedly breeding them as snake food			2
@entity8 , 24 , of of @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , kept almost 200 rodents in the cruelly cramped conditions of a wooden rabbit hutch that only had enough space for 32 of the creatures			1
most of the animals were pregnant females			0
the @entity19 was called in when residents of the village of @entity22 reported rats swarming around their back doors in october			1
sickening : the rats were forced to endure horrendous conditions by owner @entity8			1
when they escaped they swarmed through the village of standburn in @entity11 they were then able to trace the source of the animals			1
it is believed the rats had chewed through the cage and made their escape			2
@entity8 pleaded guilty to being responsible for 220 domestic rats and failing to provide them with a suitable environment and accommodation , keeping them in a wooden shed which had little light or ventilation			1
the cage , which was not rat proof to prevent them from escaping , was contaminated by faeces and the rats were forced to swarm all over each other , leading to disease			1
@entity8 used 16 small boxes to keep 50 female rats and their young in overcrowded conditions			1
he failed to separate the pregnant and weaning female rats from other rats prior to giving birth , so some of the young were consumed by other rats and their mothers			2
he also failed to prevent uncontrolled breeding and inbreeding			0
animal welfare officials today slammed a court for not banning @entity8 from keeping animals of any kind for life			1
a @entity19 officer said : ' this was a horrific case of animal neglect			0
the hutch was swarming with rats and they were piled up on top of each other due to lack of space			0
' it was clear the conditions were woefully inadequate and completely inhumane			0
' the rats were left to inbreed and newly - born rats were often consumed shortly after birth because females were not separated @entity19 inspector @entity81 said : ' @entity8 was keeping 170 rats in a two storey rabbit hutch which was approximately two foot by four foot in size			1
' of the 170 rats , 140 were females and many of them were pregnant			0
a further 50 mothers and their young were also found in smaller boxes , bringing the total number to 220			0
' in times of stress mother rats will harm or destroy their babies and we could see young being eaten by their mothers and other rats			0
' it is believed that the rats may have been bred for sale to owners of snakes			0
the court was told @entity8 had ' no interest in animals '			2
sheriff @entity105 replied : ' that much is evident			0
