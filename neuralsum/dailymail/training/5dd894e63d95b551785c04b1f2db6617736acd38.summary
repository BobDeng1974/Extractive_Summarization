in ten years we might look back at how we used to have to wait for films to download , or web pages to load , and wonder how we ever coped			2
a team of researchers has developed a @entity6 data connection that is 65,000 times faster than current 4g technology			1
the astonishing speed reached one terabit ( 125 gigabytes ) per second - the equivalent of downloading about 30 movies in a single second			1
scientists at the @entity14 showcased their new 5g technology			1
they say it is capable of reaching speeds of one terabit per second			1
that is 65,000 times faster than current 4g technology			1
it means you could download 100 movies ( stock image shown ) in just three seconds the technology was developed by scientists from the @entity14 's @entity25 ( @entity26 )			1
while comparable speeds have been seen in fibre optic cables before , this was the first test ever to achieve such a capacity wirelessly			0
the team built their own transmitters and receivers , and then performed tests over a distance of 330 feet ( 100 metres )			0
an army of airborne drones could soon be used to bring mobile phone signal and wireless internet access to the most remote parts of the @entity41			2
@entity41 ’s biggest mobile phone group @entity42 has begun working on the technology , which it hopes to deploy by the end of the decade			2
using unmanned drones to broadcast phone signal to rural communities is cheaper than erecting traditional masts , it said			0
the devices , called @entity53 , are still at an early stage of development			0
but early plans indicate they will be able to fly 0.6 miles ( 1km ) into the air in order to pick up signal from masts up to 12 miles ( 20km ) away			0
they will then beam this signal into the area below it , allowing villages below to make mobile phone calls and access the internet			0
this avoids the need to expensive cables in the ground and base stations			0
the speeds far exceed anything achieved before for @entity6 , eclipsing the 7.5 gigabits ( 940 megabytes ) per second speed achieved by @entity76 in october 2014			1
the team wants to begin testing their technology in public spaces by 2018 , while a @entity41 release of @entity6 has been hinted at in 2020 by @entity81			1
‘ we want to be the first in the world to show such high speeds , ’ professor @entity82 , director of the @entity26 , ’ told @entity83			0
he added : ‘ we have developed 10 more breakthrough technologies and one of them means we can exceed @entity91 wirelessly			0
‘ this is the same capacity as fibre optics but we are doing it wirelessly			0
’ some of the benefits of @entity6 include the possibility of playing holographic games in real - time with other smartphone users , or significantly improving time delays in financial trading			2
@entity81 has said previously that it expects @entity6 to be capable of delivering 10 to 50 gigabits per second - but this later development would blow that estimate out of the water			1
the speeds far exceed anything achieved before for @entity6 , eclipsing the 7.5 gigabits ( 940 megabytes ) per second speed achieved by @entity76 in october 2014			1

scientists at the @entity14 showcased their new @entity6 technology
they say it is capable of reaching speeds of one terabit per second
that is 65,000 times faster than current @entity125 technology
it means you could download 100 movies in just three seconds
the speed is the fastest ever achieved for a wireless data connection
@entity81 is hoping to roll - out @entity6 in @entity41 by 2020
