there are buses and then there is the @entity3 which debuted in @entity4 this week as the longest of its breed in the world			1
developed by the boffins of the @entity9 , the bus is nearly 101 feet long , has four steering axles and can carry 256 passengers			2
the big bendy bus premiered in the eastern city of @entity14 this week where it will soon roll into service with the local transportation authority on trial runs as @entity18 and @entity19 placed their orders for the vehicle which costs $ 1.25 million ( almost Â£ 778,000 ) per bus			1
@entity25 's longest bus : debuted in @entity4 , the @entity26 is nearly 101ft long and can carry 256 passengers unsafe and unreliable : bendy buses on several routes in @entity29 were banned in 2009 amid claims they were unsafe , unreliable and encourage fare - dodgers the total development is costing $ 10 million and the good news for environmentalists is that it can run for long stretches on electric power			1
@entity37 , the institute 's director said : ' there is a lot of know - how invested in it			0
it 's computer is highly efficient			0
' the innovation of the @entity3 lies not only in its length , but most of all in its ability to be manoeuvred like a conventional 12 metre ( 39ft ) city bus			1
' there 's no problem with the manoeuvrability and stability , but we have to see how such a long bus affects normal city traffic			2
' already orders : made in @entity4 , the new bendy bus has already been ordered by @entity57 cities @entity19 and @entity18 @entity4 trial : this week the vehicle debuted in @entity14 and will be part of the local transport on a trial basis it combines the passenger capacity of a small train with the manouverability of a bus and runs on a hybrid engine that kicks in when the electric batteries run down , charging them as it propels the vehicle			1
bus drivers will not require a special licence to drive the long , bendy bus thanks to a unique computer steering system which keeps the length of the bus precisely in line with the front carriage			2
the system is less expensive to run and cheaper to put into operation than a rail commuter system , prompting other cities to inquire about the super-sized buses			0
dr @entity85 said : ' the @entity3 has a considerable advantage compared to light rail systems			2
' while it is the longest bus in the world , the bus with the largest capacity is @entity57 's @entity91 which has 300 seats on a 82ft bus			1
combines transport : the bus combines the passenger capacity of a small train and the maneouverability of a bus @entity101 buses in @entity29 were banned on several routes in 2009 after they were found to be responsible for many accidents			1
@entity29 's mayor @entity104 struggled to sell the 31 vehicles amid claims they were unsafe , unreliable and encourage fare - dodgers			0
they were taken out of service temporarily in 2005 after three caught on fire			0
many were eventually sold to @entity112 in 2011			0
according to @entity113 mr @entity104 said at the time : ' these bulky and ungainly monstrosities were always more suitable for the wide open vistas of a @entity118 airport than for @entity29			0
' i am glad to see the back of them			0
