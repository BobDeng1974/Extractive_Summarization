@entity0 enters the @entity1 on tuesday			2
a @entity3 winner with @entity4 , he will line up alongside the extravagant @entity5 at the heart of @entity8 ’s back line			1
@entity5 has had an excellent tournament and has displayed leadership qualities , scoring two goals and performing alongside the captain , @entity12			1
with @entity12 banned from the semi-final against @entity14 , @entity5 will take the armband and will have to assume control of the back line			1
it ’s a big night for the new @entity20 signing from @entity21			0
now 30 and with a history of playing in @entity38 — in @entity39 , @entity40 and now in the @entity41 — the 6ft 2in centre half comes up against many of his club team - mates			0
he will know what @entity44 can do — now can he stop him ? ironically , if there was one game you might want him in for , it is this one			0
losing @entity49 is a greater problem , because he ’s the only one who scares the opposition defenders with goals and dribbles			0
i expect @entity55 to have his favoured role , with @entity22 to come in to the side , but there will be pressure on the back four			0
passion : @entity5 celebrates his free - kick against @entity62 which helped @entity8 to the last four sidelined : this yellow card for @entity12 against @entity62 ruled him out of the semi-final youngster : @entity0 in @entity3 action for @entity67 against @entity68 in 2008 like many @entity69 , @entity0 can be blase with the ball at his feet and is sometimes too casual — he can give a forward a chance — but he ’s no average understudy			1
he was part of a @entity4 defence that conceded only 23 goals in 34 league games last season and finished with a goal difference of +71 , winning the title in march			2
i played against him in 2008 when @entity68 defeated @entity67 1 - 0 to qualify for the @entity3 and he looked the part			1
against @entity14 , we will discover how he has improved			0
@entity8 have got this far because of the goals from their central defenders			0
@entity0 and @entity5 will need to be outstanding on tuesday to keep up their progress			2
experienced : @entity0 has been part of @entity4 's dominant side in @entity14 inside out : @entity0 will be aware of the threat from his @entity4 team - mate @entity44 @entity92 will raise their game - @entity94			1

@entity0 will start alongside @entity5 with @entity12 suspended
@entity4 defender will have to play a star role if @entity8 are to reach the final
@entity0 is experienced and will know the threat @entity44 brings
