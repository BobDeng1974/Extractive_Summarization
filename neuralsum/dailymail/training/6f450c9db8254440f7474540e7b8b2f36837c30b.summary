by @entity0 published : 17:48 est , 16 september 2013 updated : 17:51 est , 16 september 2013 a 23 - year - old man with @entity2 in mixed martial arts training for years is now fighting to get into the ring			2
@entity7 , of @entity8 , has been denied permission to fight against @entity10 , another disabled fighter			1
the two men were presented with a cease - and - desist order aug 2 by the @entity13 just before they were scheduled to step into the ring , according to reports			1
the fight was organized against mr @entity10 because , having cerebral palsy , he was seen as a fair opponent			1
let him fight : @entity7 ( pictured ) has amputee fighter @entity18 in his corner though state boxing commissions do not typically regulate amateur @entity5 fights , they stepped in to stop the fight between the two disabled men on grounds it was unsanctioned , according to @entity27			1
despite training non-stop for two months and having the backing of promoters , @entity28 , @entity7 ’s father , fears the fight might never happen			2
‘ it 's our belief , based on conversation with people within the @entity5 community , that getting it done in any state is n't going to be easy , ’ the father told @entity27			2
@entity28 further explained that he feels his son not being allowed into the ring is a public relations move by the sport			0
‘ there is a core group of people involved in @entity5 that are trying to protect the sport from bad @entity50 , ’ @entity28 told the network			2
" they feel having disabled people compete would give the sport a ' black eye			0
' they are also afraid of the ' sideshow ' effect			0
’ a conspiracy : @entity28 , the 23 - year - old aspiring fighter 's father , feels his son is n't being allowed into the ring because insiders want to protect the sport 's image - a sentiment with which a promoter who spoke to @entity67 agreed a prominent @entity70 - based promoter echoed @entity28 's concerns in comments to @entity67			0
‘ this is all image , if somebody gets hurt on your show … i do n’t see the upside to doing that , ’ a @entity70 - based fight promoter said			0
‘ if somebody gets hurt , then you ’re the guy who put [ a disabled person ] in the ring , ’ the promoter added			0
there is a wide gulf between the people in favour of @entity89 – as @entity7 is known in the ring – fighting , and those against it			0
‘ one respected athletic inspector said that allowing @entity7 to fight in an @entity5 bout was exploitative , no matter if the audience cheered and gave holeve a standing ovation after the fight , ’ @entity94 , editor of @entity5 website @entity96 told @entity27			1
‘ the concept of allowing someone with … limited cognitive ability and brain issues to take punches and get slammed drew a swiftly negative reaction amongst the people i interviewed , ’ @entity94 added			0
it 's his dream : all mr @entity7 wants to do is get in the ring , in a fair fight - he 's not gunning for the @entity113 @entity18 , famous for going undefeated in his first 10 professional @entity5 fights as an amputee , has trained with @entity7 – and feels he ’s getting a raw deal			1
‘ i think we should give him a chance , ’ mr @entity18 told @entity67			1
‘ everyone deserves an equal chance			0
’ explaining that he ’s also trained with mr @entity10 , mr @entity18 – who goes by ‘ @entity122 ’ in the ring , said that both men are equal competitors			1
‘ i think that ’s a good fair fight , the kid ’s not asking to fight in the @entity113 , ’ said mr @entity18 , adding that ‘ he just wants a small - time , amateur fight			1
’ explaining that ‘ it ’s not a street fight , ’ and that there are referees and medics , mr @entity18 said ‘ it ’s safety first ... it 's not like he 's even going to be on tv			2
' notorious : mr @entity18 has won his first 10 pro fights and is a champion , he does n't feel it 's fair to keep mr @entity7 out of the ring mr @entity18 said that he noticed no physical limitations with @entity7 when he trained and that it will not matter if he wins or loses , he just wants to get into the ring			1
' people said the same things about me … and look at me , i ’m 10 - 0 and a world champion , ' the undefeated fighter said			0
for now , according to @entity27 , the two fighters are looking to fight in @entity150 – and mr @entity18 is all for it			2
‘ if the kid ’s training hard and chasing his dream , who ’s anyone to say he ca n’t … it ’s not fair			0

@entity7 , 23 , was set to fight @entity10 , an opponent with cerebral palsy
the state of @entity8 instead issued a cease - and - desist order just before the fight took place
@entity18 , an amputee @entity5 champion , has trained with mr @entity7 and thinks he should be given a chance
