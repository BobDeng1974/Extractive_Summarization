by @entity0 @entity2 , soya and tofu - it seems they have all had their day as protein - rich meat substitutes			1
now , one @entity8 woman claims that the new super food set to take over our kitchen counters is maggots			2
and she has developed a new machine to make cooking up dishes much easier			2
the woman behind the @entity23 device , @entity24 , said the machine is designed to be the perfect environment for flies and their larvae allowing in enough light and space for them to grow the woman behind the @entity33 device is @entity24 , an industrial design graduate of @entity35 in @entity36 , who wants to tackle the factory farmed meat industry by growing protein at home			1
@entity17 432 device can harvest half a kilogram of larvae every week , which is enough for two meals			1
she describes the cooked larvae as smelling like starchy potatoes with a nutty and meaty taste			1
the machine is designed to be the perfect environment for flies and their larvae allowing in enough light and space for them to grow			2
@entity24 recommends eating the larvae with tomato risotto			1
' i like to mix parboiled rice with wild rice together with the larvae , put a lot of tomato sauce in it and a bit of parmesan cheese , ' she said by 2050 meat production will need to increase by 50 per cent to meet population increase			1
@entity24 predicts that because we already use one third of croplands for the production of animal feed , it will be necessary to develop alternative food sources and production methods			1
the @entity72 is in agreement			0
in a recent report , it suggests that insects are a viable source of protein for humans , animals and pets			2
the report highlighted grasshoppers , ants and other bugs as protein - packed substitutes that are less harmful to the environment than traditional meat			1
while the current design is for home use , the system can be scaled up for professional kitchens			0
it is also easy enough for anyone to use , she says			0
to begin with , you simply drop some black soldier fly larvae into an appliance chamber			0
here they grow and then move to a larger chamber , mate and produce larva			0
this falls down into a separate area , where it matures , moves on up a tube , and falls into a cup			0
some larvae are dropped back into the machine to restart the process , while the rest are ready to eat			0
black soldier flies were chosen as they are easy to breed and contain up to 42 per cent protein - double the amount in the average chicken breast - and a high level of calcium and amino acids			1
a gram of black soldier fly eggs can become 2.4 kilograms of edible protein after 432 hours in the @entity123			0
but if black soldier flies are n’t to your taste then other larvae may be used in the same way			1
the cooked larvae are said to smell like starchy potatoes and have a nutty and meaty taste while the current design is for home use , the system can be scaled up for professional kitchens by 2050 meat production is predicted to increase by 50 per cent to meet population increase			1

speaking with @entity161 , ms @entity24 recommends eating the larvae with tomato risotto			1
‘ i like to mix parboiled rice with wild rice together with the larvae , put a lot of tomato sauce in it and a bit of parmesan cheese , ’ she said			0
‘ a bit of parsley or basil on top and you have a perfect meal			0
’ a machine that breeds maggots for your dinner table could soon be found on a kitchen counter near you			0

@entity24 has developed a maggot - breeding device for the kitchen
it produces @entity190 larvae which contain up to 42 per cent protein
the cooked larvae ' smell like starchy potatoes and have a nutty taste '
