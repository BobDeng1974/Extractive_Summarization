by @entity0 letters penned by notorious serial killer @entity2 have been bought by a private collector for £ 4,000 eight personal letters written by a notorious @entity6 serial killer have been bought by a private collector despite an appeal to have them preserved for the nation			1
@entity2 - dubbed the @entity11 - was hanged in @entity12 in 1873 after being found guilty of poisoning her stepson with arsenic			1
@entity15 , from @entity16 , @entity17 , is also widely believed to be responsible for the deaths of up to 20 , including her husbands and children			1
her letters , written from prison and addressed to a man who had lodged at @entity15 's home , make reference to solicitors and financial problems and were put up for sale on @entity31			1
an online campaign was launched to raise the £ 4,000 sought for them			2
but the money was not raised in time and the letters were bought by a private collector , who wishes to remain anonymous			1
however , copies of the letters have since been donated to the @entity40 and @entity41 in @entity42 , @entity17			1
the buyer said : ' unfortunately the campaign 's fundraising was very slow , and the seller was keen to sell them sooner rather than later			0
' i am a private collector of @entity6 crime memoribilia and purchased the letters			2
' i have since made high resolution copies which have been sent to @entity40 and @entity41 , and have also posted scans on the campaign @entity55 page			1
' ms @entity2 wrote the letters to her lodger , @entity58 , weeks before she was executed			1
@entity59 , who was part of the online campaign to buy the letters , said : ' i think the sale of the letters to the collector has turned out well , even though it was n't the campaign group who were able to secure them			2
' he appears to empathise with the desires of the team and has kindly offered to provide good copies of the letters for this group			2
' it 's not the resolution everyone wanted , but it is the next best thing			0
' @entity15 was suspected of poisoning 21 people in total , including her own children , husband , lovers and mother despite protesting her innocence , ms @entity2 was hanged in march 1873 ms @entity2 wrote the letters to her lodger , @entity58 , weeks before she was executed @entity2 , who always professed her innocence , is believed to have killed three husbands , a lover , a friend , her mother and 12 children , using arsenic			1
they all died suffering from stomach complaints and she was found guilty of murder in march 1873			0
she was hanged at @entity97 on march 24 that year			0
the buyer has donated copies of the letters to the @entity40 and @entity41 @entity101 , @entity102 , the home of murderer @entity104 and where she was living when she was arrested in 1873 a view inside @entity102 maximum security prison , where the @entity107 were held and serial murderer @entity2 was hung here while @entity2 's letters that have sold on @entity31 might give an insight into the mind of a killer , some now believe that she might not have been guilty in the first place			1
she was convicted of only one murder , that of her stepson , after suspicions were aroused when he died shortly after she failed to get him admitted to a workhouse			0
he suffered gastro intestinal problems , as had many other people the dressmaker and nurse had dealings with over a 20 year period , including three of her husbands and a number of her children and stepchildren			1
even though in all cases she claimed an insurance pay out , none of these deaths were deemed suspicious , until her stepson died			0
an inquest revealed the presence of arsenic , and subsequent exhumations also found the same poison in some of the bodies			0
despite protesting her innocence , she was hanged in march 1873 , the execution being delayed until after the birth of her 11th child			2
however , some believe the deaths could equally have been due to poverty and poor medical facilities , and she was merely a victim of the times			0
local author , @entity147 , studied the court transcripts , information from the @entity150 and newspapers and found a list of errors in evidence and legal process at her trial			0
' the available evidence was lacking to say the least , ' he said			0
' she had no forensic expert to rebuke the prosecutions comments , witness statements in her defence were lodged , but were not acceptable			0
' in the accordance with law it would in my opinion be questionable as to her guilty verdict			0

the eight letters were written by ' @entity11 ' @entity2
she was *accused* of poisoning 21 people , including her children
campaigners tried to raise enough cash to buy them for a *museum*
but the money was not raised in time , and they were bought privately
however , copies have been donated to the @entity41 , @entity17
@entity15 always professed her innocence before she was hanged in 1873
