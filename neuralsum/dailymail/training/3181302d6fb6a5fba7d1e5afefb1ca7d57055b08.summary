by @entity0 a student has been fined for driving a car without any doors , lights or bonnet - and using his arms to indicate when turning			1
@entity7 mistakenly believed the @entity8 was still legal to drive , despite the missing doors , headlights , indicators , bonnet and brake lights , because it had a valid @entity15 certificate			1
the 25 - year - old drove the car , described by police as a ' skeleton of a vehicle ' , for almost three miles before he was pulled over			1
@entity7 , who studies electrical engineering at college and works part - time as a pizza delivery man , was attempting to take it to a recycling centre five miles from his home in @entity28 , @entity29 , to sell for scrap			1
he had already removed a selection of parts to sell online			0
' skeleton of a car ' : @entity7 , 25 , was pulled over by police while driving this @entity8 which had no doors , headlights , indicator , bonnet or brake lights mistaken : the father - of - two , who removed the car parts so he could sell them individually for more money , claimed he thought he could still legally drive the car on public roads as it had a valid @entity15 the father - of - two was found guilty of using a vehicle when its use involved a danger of injury to any person and was fined £ 110 at @entity52			1
he was also ordered to pay £ 120 costs and given three penalty points on his licence			0
after the hearing , @entity7 said : ' the car did n't have any lights on it , but my argument was that it was daylight			1
it did n't have any signals either , but i used arm signals to indicate			0
' @entity7 added he thought the car was safe to drive because it still had an @entity15 certificate - and said he had n't removed any of what he thought were key working parts			1
he said there were kit cars on the road that also lacked features such as doors and lights			2
@entity7 , who studies electrical engineering at college , said : ' i only did it so i could get more money back for the car			2
in court : @entity7 , from @entity28 , @entity29 , was fined £ 110 after he was found guilty of using a vehicle when its use involved a danger of injury to a person ' i would n't have driven it if i did n't think it was safe for the road			1
' i was starting college and i was only going to get £ 150 at the scrapyard , so i thought if i took the doors off and a few other parts i could get more money back			1
' he added he had ' learned his lesson ' and ' would n't make the same mistake again '			0
a spokesman for @entity98 said : ' there are strict rules governing the safety of vehicles in this country			0
' it would n't have taken much to realise that the skeleton of a vehicle @entity7 was trying to drive on the carriageway was not roadworthy			1
' it beggars belief that he thought he could drive it without anyone having concerns			2
' in doing so he put the safety of himself and others at risk			0
we had to take action			0
' the car was eventually collected for scrap and @entity7 was paid £ 70			1
he has since bought a new @entity8			2
a spokesman for the @entity121 said : ' it 's plan daft to strip everything off a car and then drive it on a public road			2
' the main point here is that cars are designed to minimise crashes and injuries			0
' if a car that has been stripped of its body work then hits a pedestrian , there 's a risk sharp edges that would have been covered up could cause much worse injuries to the person involved			0
' also , new cars have day time headlights that warn pedestrians a car is heading their way			2
if these are removed , then the pedestrian wo n't have that extra time to see the car coming towards them			0
' if this person had hit someone , and his alterations to the car made the difference as to whether the pedestrian survived or not , he could have been in a lot more trouble than he is now			0
' he has got off lightly			0
' how it used to look : @entity7 decided to remove all the parts from the car after being told he would only get £ 150 for the entire vehicle at a scrapyard it is illegal to drive a vehicle on public roads in the @entity164 without a valid @entity15 test - except to and from the garage where a pre-booked test or remedial work is being carried out			1
an @entity15 checks a vehicle 's lights , indicators , tyres , brakes and bodywork			1
it is illegal to drive a car that has failed to pass the test on any of these			0
an @entity15 certificate proves a car is road worthy on the day it is tested			2
but while an @entity15 test would still be valid after major damage is caused to a vehicle , it would still be illegal to drive it if it were no longer road worthy			1
individuals are responsible for making sure their vehicles remain in a road worthy condition			0
so a vehicle is n't road worthy if the headlights do n't work , it has faulty brakes , worn out tyres or seatbelts that do n't work , even if the @entity15 is still within date			2
a driver can be stopped by police and prosecuted for driving a vehicle not in a road worthy condition .			0
