by @entity0 published : 04:35 est , 29 march 2012 updated : 06:16 est , 29 march 2012 the extent of the influence the @entity3 has over government legislation has been laid bare in letters between ministers and @entity7			1
they reveal how permission has been sought from prince @entity10 before passing laws in at least a dozen separate areas during the past five years , from road safety and energy reforms to gambling and planning			0
the papers shed light for the first time on how the @entity20 has been consulted on @entity21 that may affect his estate before they are debated in @entity24			0
influence : documents revealed the @entity3 indicated he was ' content ' with the @entity21 in november 2008 @entity29 , then a @entity28 minister , wrote to the @entity3 ’s private secretary sir @entity30 to consult him on the @entity31 and @entity32 , according to the @entity33			1
the letters include two copies of the @entity21 in its draft form and a detailed summary of how it could affect the @entity39 , the @entity3 ’s private estate			1
the private secretary responded two months later , thanking mr @entity29 and replying : ‘ i can confirm that the @entity3 is content with the @entity21 ’			1
the response reveals the level of influence the @entity3 appears to wield in matters of legislation and appears to suggest he sees his role as going further than that envisaged by ministers			2
the requirement for ministers have been forced to seek permission stems from a little - known constitutional right for the prince to effectively veto legislation in areas which might affect his private interests			1
although it is known the @entity3 's permission has been sought in the past , the newly released correspondence is the first time light has been shed on the process , as @entity61 and @entity7 have refused to comment			2
correspondence : the letters between sir @entity30 ( left ) and @entity29 ( right ) reveal how the @entity3 is able to veto legislation the documents were released by the information commissioner , after an initial application by @entity68 , a public notary and graduate law student at @entity69 , was turned down by the @entity70 ( @entity70 )			1
the commissioner ruled that part of the correspondence could be released as it concerned the @entity3 ’s role as landowner rather than heir to the throne			1
other documents still remain secret			0
mr @entity68 said it was clear there would be other unpublished cases where the @entity3 may have raised objections			0
‘ the real issue is about those acts where there are changes made to the @entity88 as a result of representations made by the @entity3 , ’ he told the paper			0
a spokesman for the @entity70 commented that the @entity3 ’s consent relates only to the aspects concerning the @entity39 , although it was ‘ expressed to be to the @entity21 itself ’			0
but the revelation about the @entity3 's power of consent could add to concerns the heir to the throne may be overstepping his constitutional role			1
the @entity3 's role in government matters has been criticised in the past , with him facing accusations of unconstitutional ‘ meddling ’ in politics			2
documents released under a @entity107 last year revealed @entity10 held at least nine private meetings with ministers during a ten - month period from may 2010			2
they show he appeared to focus on ministers responsible for his ‘ hobby horse ’ issues , such as global warming , conservation , architecture and agriculture			0
the published diaries of @entity119 also claimed @entity120 became so exasperated by the prince ’s high - profile interventions while he was prime minister that he complained to the @entity123 .			0

correspondence shows the @entity3 was consulted on the @entity31 and @entity32
little - known constitutional right effectively gives the @entity3 power of veto over legislation that affects his private interests
