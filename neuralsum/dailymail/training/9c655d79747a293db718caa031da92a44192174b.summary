by @entity0 published : 06:05 est , 6 june 2012 updated : 07:28 est , 6 june 2012 plans : @entity2 is believed to be setting up a growth bond scheme to use @entity5 's savers to pay for @entity7 projects hard - pressed @entity5 may be asked to bail out the @entity7 and help finance a spending spree to pull the @entity5 out of the economic doldrums , it was claimed today			1
@entity5 's ' cash rich ' savers could soon be encouraged by the chancellor to transfer billions of their own money into the @entity15 's coffers to help force the @entity5 out of recession			2
using a ploy used during the @entity18 , @entity2 wants the @entity19 to offer new ' growth bonds ' that will persuade people to move savings out of their bank and building society accounts			1
the billions this would raise would be spent on new toll roads , green energy schemes and building new houses , sources say , and help boost @entity5 's faltering economy			1
in return savers would get attractive interest rates and potentially tax - free profits			1
in 1940 , as @entity5 struggled to cope with the crippling cost of fighting @entity40 , savings certificates as they were known , paid for @entity35 , tanks and warships , as well as keeping the country running			0
now it appears that the government wants to use the nation 's savers in the same way , building new tube lines , toll roads along @entity5 's busiest routes and new housing with their money			2
' while a lot of families are struggling and have no disposable income , there are others who are quite cash rich but have nowhere secure to put their money with a decent return , ' a senior government source told @entity59			0
cash rich : the @entity19 believes that although there are many hard - up families many others have savings they are desperate to invest into a scheme like this one , it was claimed ' because interest rates are as low as they are , there is the potential to tap into this money and get it invested in infrastructure , which will have a dramatic effect on @entity5 's long - term growth			1
' not only will it provide a welcome kick - start to the economy at a time when it is sluggish , but infrastructure improvement will will also help @entity5 's long - term competitiveness and encourage investment from overseas			1
it is a win - win			0
' mr @entity2 's key bargaining chip is believed to be offering savers more of the tax - free returns given to those who have @entity86			2
and having their money in the @entity19 would give savers added security as they would not lose their money			0
old idea : in @entity18 a similar scheme was used to raise money to pay for @entity5 's @entity35 and @entity95 as the economy struggled with the cost of war isas alone hold more than £ 385 billion worth of cash and a lack of other decent investment opportunities may open the door for these growth bonds			1
since taking power the @entity15 has promised to spend big on infrastructure improvements like a new @entity108 or @entity109 tube extension in @entity110 , as well as £ 20 billion from its balances to support small business borrowing			0
@entity113 and @entity114 have sought investment from all over the world , including from @entity118 pension funds and @entity120 countries like @entity121 , who have enormous sovereign wealth funds			0
but a move to get @entity5 pension funds to bankroll some of the proposed improvements have so far not come to fruition , prompting the growth bond plan that could be up and running by the autumn			0
a @entity19 source told the @entity130 said today the claims were ' speculative ' , with an official spokesman adding : ' as the prime minister said last month , the government is looking at ways to use the @entity5 ’s credibility , through the use of its wider balance sheet , to support growth in the economy			2
further details on this will be brought forward in due course			0

the chancellor is said to be planning @entity7 ' growth bonds ' that offer savers attractive interest rates
this cash would be used to build *bridges* , toll roads and houses
*experts* believe this type of spending would help kick - start the failing economy
