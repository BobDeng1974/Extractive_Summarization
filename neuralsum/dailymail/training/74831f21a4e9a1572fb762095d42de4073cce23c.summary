a 466 mile - long chasm on the same scale as parts of the @entity3 has been discovered beneath the @entity5 ice sheet			1
the canyon , which is as deep as 800 metres in places , is thought to predate the ice sheet , which has itself been around for millions of years			1
it has the characteristics of a meandering river channel , although it dwarfs the @entity13 ’s largest river , the @entity14 , which is less than half the length and far more shallow			2
it can be seen in the centre of this 3d visualisation of the @entity5 bedrock for the northern half of the island the canyon was found after scientists analysed radar signals collected by @entity29 and researchers from the @entity13 and @entity31 over several decades			1
at certain frequencies , ice is transparent to radio waves which can bounce off the bedrock underneath , according to a group of international researchers who published their findings in the journal @entity40			2
by analysing all the radar data the team discovered a continuous bedrock canyon that extends from the centre of the island and ends at its northern extremity in a deep fjord connecting to the @entity48			0
professor @entity49 , of @entity51 ’s @entity50 , said : ' with @entity52 available for many cities around the world and digital maps for everything from population density to happiness one might assume that the landscape of the @entity60 has been fully explored and mapped			0
' our research shows there ’s still a lot left to discover			0
' the researchers believe the canyon plays an important role in transporting sub-glacial meltwater produced at the bed from the interior to the edge of the ice sheet and ultimately into the ocean			1
in august , a 466 mile - long ( 750 km ) chasm on the same scale as parts of the @entity3 was discovered beneath the @entity5 ice sheet			1
the canyon , which is as deep as 2,620ft ( 800m ) in places , is thought to predate the ice sheet , which has itself been around for millions of years even before the presence of the ice sheet , going back at least four million years , the evidence suggests the canyon provided a pathway for water from the interior to the coast			1
professor @entity89 , ice2sea co-ordinator based at the @entity90 in @entity91 said : ' a discovery of this nature shows that the @entity60 has not yet given up all its secrets			1
' a 750km canyon preserved under the ice for millions of years is a breathtaking find in itself , but this research is also important in furthering our understanding of @entity5 ’s past			2
the researchers believe the canyon plays an important role in transporting sub-glacial meltwater produced at the bed from the interior to the edge of the ice sheet and ultimately into the ocean ' this area ’s ice sheet contributes to sea level rise and this work can help us put current changes in context			1
' some of the data used in the study came from @entity29 ’s @entity120 , which is a six - year mission and the largest airborne survey of @entity60 ’s polar ice ever flown			2
@entity124 , a scientist working on the project based at @entity126 said : ' two things helped lead to this discovery			0
scientist @entity124 said : ' it is quite remarkable that a 750km - long channel the size of parts of the @entity3 is discovered in the 21st century below the @entity133 ( pictured )			0
it shows how little we still know about the bedrock below large continental ice sheets ' ' it was the enormous amount of data collected by @entity120 and the work of combining it with other datasets into a @entity5 - wide compilation of all existing data that makes this feature appear in front of our eyes			0
