@entity1 goalkeeper @entity0 denied @entity3 victory with a performance that has n't been seen by the host nation since @entity6 ' famous save against @entity7			1
@entity0 pulled off a succession of physics - defying stops as @entity1 held out for a 0 - 0 draw against the tournament favourites in @entity12 , leaving both teams level on four points in @entity15 the @entity1 no 1 's most memorable stop resembled @entity17 ' save during the group stages of the 1970 @entity19 ... and came against the heir to @entity7 's throne , @entity22			1
@entity0 followed that with a close range block against @entity44 midfielder @entity43 before denying @entity22 for a second time after getting down to a low drilled effort at his near post			0
point blank : the @entity48 saves from @entity49 in the closing minutes to keep an all - important clean sheet man hug : @entity53 ( c ) congratulates @entity0 for yet another save during the @entity15 match one man wall : @entity0 puts his body between @entity43 and the goal for another superb save on course : @entity1 's 0 - 0 draw with favourites @entity3 leaves them level at the top of @entity15 the wall : @entity0 denied @entity22 for a second time with a block from a drilled shot to his near post contrasting fortunes : @entity22 is left dejected while @entity0 is congratulated by teammates the 28 - year - old maintained his concentration to keep out @entity49 's header in the dying minutes to keep @entity1 on course to qualify for the knockout stages			2
