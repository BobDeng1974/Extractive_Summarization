mechanic mr @entity5 was called in to assess the vehicle by auctioneers rendells after the death of the car ’s owner			1
he said : ' i had no idea what the car was and absolutely shocked to hear they can go for so much money			2
i was thinking perhaps it was a few hundred pounds ’ worth			2
it took a while to find out what it was because they are so rare			2
' eventually it became clear it was this long lost make of car			0
it ’s not in bad condition - it has an aluminium body so that ’s not corroded			0
' i was quite impressed with the chassis			0
i did n’t think there ’d be much left of it to be honest but actually it ’s pretty solid			1

it has already attracted massive worldwide interest which is growing ' it will be a great project for somebody			0
it will be fascinating to see how it turns out if it does get restored			0
' production of the @entity4 ran from 1954 - 55 with the car based on the @entity79			1
it was targeted at the @entity82 market the name a marketing ploy to appeal to the @entity85 ’ love of all things ltalian			0
the 1991cc engine was a straight four fed by twin sus and the four - speed gearbox could be had with an optional overdrive			0
@entity92 of @entity93 said there had already been interest from @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity85 and the @entity1			0
' it took us several days to identify it because parts that look like an @entity102 and others like a @entity79 , ” he said			0
' we finally found the paperwork , however , and there ’s a lot of interesting ephemera that comes with the car			1
auction : @entity110 said there had already been interest from @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity85 and the @entity1 rare : the car is right - hand drive which is rare and the car was re-registered in 1965 hence its c - plate it ’s right hand drive too which is rare			0
sadly i do n’t have the original log book and for some reason it was re-registered in 1965 , hence the c plate			2
' this is going to be a very interesting project for someone			0

' i ’ve only ever had four in my 30 - year career			0
once i discovered a @entity132 that had been bricked up during the war			0
' we could n’t work out why the garage interior was too short but then we went through the wall and discovered the car which had been put there at a time when everything had to be submitted as scrap metal for the war effort			2
project : auctioneers hope the car will be an interesting project for someone to work on restoration : if the car was spruced up it could be worth at least £ 50,000 to £ 60,000 ' it ’s always good fun and the best thing when you find something as rare as the @entity4 is that there will be international interest			1
' i ’ve recently seen a badly restored example on offer with a guide price of £ 11000 to £ 12000			2
a @entity4 in the @entity163 fetched the equivalent of £ 120,000			1
' it ’s hard to say what it will fetch but if someone was to spend £ 20,000 restoring it they would have a car worth at least £ 50,000 to £ 60,000 - maybe double that			1
' also unearthed at the @entity6 property which had lain untouched for years were two rotting @entity174 , a @entity175 , a restorable @entity176 and two @entity177			1
a @entity178 is still there but the building it ’s in has collapsed making retrieval a health and safety nightmare			0
elsewhere in the extensive grounds are the remains of several other cars too , now nothing more than scrap .			0
