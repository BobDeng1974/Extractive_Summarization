a video showing @entity2 ' sister @entity1 attacking @entity3 took the internet by storm on monday			2
but the couple surprisingly were not keeping a low profile after news of the fight , which took place last week , broke			0
instead , the singer and rapper went to watch the @entity13 play @entity14 at the @entity15 in @entity16 on monday evening			2
instead , the pair were laughing and looking carefree as they sat courtside during the basketball game			0
@entity2 , 32 , looked glamorous in a denim jumpsuit and black sandals with intricately designed gold heels			0
keeping composed : the singer was seen looking at the cameras while sitting courtside at the basketball game glamorous : the 32 - year - old looked great in a denim jumpsuit and heels alongside her casually clad husband affectionate moment : as they shared a joke about something , the rapper was seen placing a hand on his wife 's ankle new club : @entity3 - pictured with @entity2 - is opening a new branch of his sports bar at @entity55 airport meanwhile @entity3 , real name @entity3 , was casually clad in a white t - shirt and trainers , along with black trousers and a gold chain around his neck			0
@entity2 was seen leaving the party with @entity1 after the fight , while @entity3 headed home alone in a separate car			2
a few days later , the sisters apparently made a getaway to @entity68 , where they apparently joined @entity69 for her secret wedding			1
on their feet : the excited pair jumped up to clap at one point , even though the @entity13 lost to the @entity14 cool customer : much like during the elevator fight , @entity2 was calm and collected during the evening deep in thought : at one point the couple looked to be having a serious conversation , perhaps about the fight eyes on the prize : with even more attention on them than usual , @entity2 and @entity3 tried to focus on the game according to @entity86 , @entity69 's wedding took place on friday and was a ' quick , simple ceremony - only around 30 people			1
' on thursday , three days after the attack in an elevator at @entity27 in @entity16 , @entity2 and @entity1 arrived in @entity68 onboard a private plane around 7:56pm , according to @entity93			1
it comes after it was reported in local paper @entity95 that their mother @entity97 , @entity100 member @entity99 and @entity69 's fiance @entity101 were also in @entity68 , suggesting it was for @entity69 and @entity101 's nuptials , which has now been confirmed by @entity104			1
under control : @entity2 is said to have flown with @entity1 to @entity68 for @entity69 's wedding days after the attack damage control : @entity2 also left the @entity28 after party with @entity1 , who apparently had a row with @entity112 that same night nothing to see here : the power couple did n't seem to have a care in the world on the same day the video was released lean on me : @entity2 , who has two - year - old daughter @entity120 with @entity3 , looked like she was about to rest her head on his shoulder @entity2 did little to quash the rumours as she posted a picture on her @entity126 , looking as though she was dressed in a bridesmaid outfit			1
in the shocking video , @entity1 was lashing out wildly at her brother - in - law , 44 , with both her arms and her legs , while her sister stood beside them looking curiously impassive			2
the seemingly unprovoked attack plays out in footage obtained by @entity136			0
best seats in the house : only the best will do for the basketball fans , who also attended a game on saturday all forgiven ? : @entity3 was seen cuddling @entity1 's son at the basketball a few days following the incident shocking : the footage , caught on surveillance camera after the @entity28 on may 5 , shows @entity1 lashing out wildly unprovoked ? : it is not known what caused the fight			1
in the video , @entity3 did not retaliate while @entity2 stood there impassively @entity1 can be clearly be seen kicking and swinging violently at @entity3 , the father of her two - year - old niece , @entity120 , after the trio step into the elevator			2
the clip shows a man who appears to be a bodyguard holding her back , but the 27 - year - old still manages to rain blows on @entity3 several times			0
the bodyguard can also be seen pushing the emergency stop button in the elevator at the 12th floor , no doubt stop the fight spilling out in front of photographers			0
during the frenzied altercation , @entity3 grabs @entity1 's stiletto clad foot to block a kick but never attempts to retaliate			2
while there still has been no word from either @entity2 or @entity3 's representatives , a spokesperson from @entity27 in @entity16 has made a statement			1
following calls regarding the leaked @entity179 footage , reps for @entity27 told @entity180 , they were ' shocked and disappointed ' in what had been a ' clear breach of our security system '			0
they said in a statement : ' we are investigating with the utmost urgency the circumstances surrounding the situation and , as is our customary practice , will discipline and prosecute the individuals involved to our fullest capacity			0
' the aftermath : the trio are seen leaving the elevator immediately after the attack wedding belle : it is thought that @entity2 posted this photo from @entity68 while sporting a bridesmaid outfit it 's not yet known what provoked the fight , however , the famous couple looked as happy as ever as they attended another @entity13 game on saturday while @entity1 played a gig in @entity16			1
rather tellingly , @entity3 had his arms affectionately around @entity1 's son who is known as @entity211 , now nine , as the family sat courtside			0
@entity2 and @entity3 have remained silent on @entity213 following the incident , but @entity1 rather oddly tweeted on sunday : ' this might have been top 10 days ever in life			0
' it has also been claimed that @entity1 yelled at @entity112 earlier at the after party , held at the @entity27 's @entity219 , with @entity86 's source adding that @entity2 ' got in the middle of it '			1
there may be trouble ahead : @entity2 and @entity1 are pictured shortly before the fight occurred the calm before the storm : @entity2 was also photographed with @entity3 at the party , held at the @entity27 's @entity229			1

@entity231 apparently took her sister to @entity68 for @entity69 's wedding days after the fight
