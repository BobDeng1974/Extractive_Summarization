by @entity0 a new federal investigation has revealed that two planes nearly crashed into each other as one was landing and another was taking off at @entity4 last month			1
the @entity6 report classified the april 24 incident between a @entity9 flight coming from @entity10 and an @entity12 flight bound for @entity13 as a near midair collision			0
according to the report , the planes came within approximately 200 feet laterally and were separated by about 400 feet vertically			1
little room to spare : the planes were 400 feet away from each other vertically but only 200 feet laterally , and the outbound pilot is heard telling air traffic control that he was ' real close ' to the other plane near miss : as the planes continued on their routes , they came closer and closer to hitting the @entity9 flight was carrying 155 passengers and six crew members			1
the @entity12 flight was carrying 47 passengers and three crew members			0
according to the @entity6 report , an air traffic controller waited for another plane to land on the east - west runway , then cleared the @entity12 to take off heading north			1
at that point , the @entity9 flight was about three miles away			0
by the time the @entity12 flight started its takeoff roll , the @entity9 flight was about one mile away			0
as the two planes approached each other , the @entity9 flight was ordered by the tower to abort its landing and go back up			2
the @entity12 pilot can be heard on radio telling air traffic controllers he was keeping the plane 's nose down as he climbed			2
hub : @entity9 directs many of their flights through @entity4 close call : a @entity9 737 jet landing at @entity4 nearly collided into a smaller plane that was taking off in april ( not pictured ) at one point he tells the tower the @entity9 flight came ' real close ' to him			1
the incident occurred at the northeast corner of the airport , where two north - south runways intersect with runway 29 , an east - west runway			2
runway 29 , shorter by about one - third than the two north - south runways , normally is used to provide additional capacity or offer an alternative if high winds make the other two more treacherous			0
it has been used more frequently since the @entity65 and @entity66 - which operates the airport - began a 60 - day rehabilitation of one of the two north - south runways at the beginning of april			0
an official with the air traffic controllers ' union at @entity4 did n't immediately respond to a message seeking comment monday			1

an outbound *commuter* plane came within 400 feet of a landing 737
the landing plane was told to abort and go back up in the air when the control tower realized how close it was to an *accident*
*problem* was caused by one plane taking off from a *rarely* - used runway that intersects with a *busier* , *longer* runway
@entity4 controllers are looking for different ways to manage the plane traffic because of *construction* on one of the main runways
