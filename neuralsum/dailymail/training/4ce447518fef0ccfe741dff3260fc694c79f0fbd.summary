@entity0 taped up his mouth and would n't speak to the press ahead of his fight with @entity11 the boxer let his uncle and trainer @entity23 talk on his behalf during the press conference @entity23 , his uncle and trainer , did have something to say : ' the @entity16 wanted us to tone it down a bit so here 's @entity0 ... the @entity16 dummy			1

i hold my hands up			0
i share some of the blame for what went on			0
fortunately there was nothing physical			0
' @entity23 and @entity79 revealed that they were upset at being excluded from the @entity16 hearing			0
promoter @entity69 apologised for the issues at their previous meeting saying he could have controlled it @entity0 was fined £ 15,000 for his four - letter outburst when the pair last came face to face this year @entity79 said : ' we need characters in boxing			1
sometimes @entity0 is the gentleman but on other occasions he gets rubbed up the wrong way and he should be allowed to express himself			2
' the irony , of course , is that this impersonation of @entity95 will generate as much publicity as his wild misconduct has done hitherto			0
@entity11 was in a mellow mood but when it was drawn to his attention that @entity0 was indicating with his fingers a first or second round stoppage , he said simply : ' i will knock him out			1
' @entity104 now holds its breath , waiting to see if @entity0 will be able to hold his peace until the end of november			2
