it ’s had a profound effect on my life , ' mr @entity13 told the newspaper			1
' i ’m not angry with the man that attacked me			2
he was a sick man			0
what i do hold a grudge about , because people should be accountable , are the contractors who had been working in the subway and let him pick up these hacksaws they left unattended			2
' on the night of the attack , mr @entity14 calmly walked towards the 4 - foot - 11 mr @entity13 with the two chainsaws and began cutting into his chest			1
the elderly @entity6 native begged his attacker to stop carving , offering him cash and credit cards , but he ignored the pleas			2
finally he stopped , said ' now i will take your credit cards and your money ' and walked calmly out of the station			0
at the time , mr @entity13 told the media how construction workers had ignored his cries for help			1
subway : the postal worker was in the 110th and @entity17 station on his way to work when he was attacked with two chainsaws ' i screamed for help			2
' please help ! please help me ! ' the ... people ( construction workers ) heard me			2
they never stopped to help me , and that disturbed me more than anything else			0
i begged for somebody to call an ambulance and to get this guy off me , ' he explained			0
' ... i was bleeding everyplace			0
no transit employee ever came over to me to see how i was doing			0
they just kept doing their job			0
that 's what upsets me more than anything else			0
there were at least six of them there , and they could have gotten him off me			0
it 's a sad commentary on how people just do n't give a damn			0
' doctors said if the saws had cut just a millimetre deeper , the postal worker would have been dead			0

mr @entity13 sued both for unspecified damages for his physical and emotional injuries but the @entity32 was let off due to governmental immunity			1
