incredibly , after @entity6 ’ left arm was ‘ temporarily ’ amputated it was driven three miles to another hospital where specialists treated the golf ball - sized tumour with high - doses of radiation			1
a team of 10 medics then sewed her arm - which had been cut off at the shoulder - back on again at the @entity18 in @entity19			1

her mother , @entity20 , 37 , a teacher , said : ‘ she had a virus before @entity40 , she never was a poorly child before cancer			2
‘ she came out in a rash and i could n’t control her temperature so i took her to the doctors who told me it was a virus , which in his defence it was			0
‘ she could n’t shake it and had about six weeks off poorly and stayed on the sofa			0
‘ then a lump appeared in the middle of her left arm and i knew it was n’t a break or anything like that because she had n’t been doing anything			0
@entity6 's left arm was temporarily amputated and driven three miles to another hospital where specialists treated the golf ball - sized tumour with high - doses of radiation @entity6 was diagnosed with @entity22 's sarcoma on january 30 , 2012			1
she underwent eight weeks of chemotherapy and radiotherapy to shrink the tumour in her arm			1
six months later , she was admitted to the @entity18 in @entity19			1

‘ i said to my husband it was cancer and he said i was talking nonsense			0
‘ when we were told it was cancer we held it together until we got to the car and i just wanted to go home , i was distraught			0
‘ when the doctors told us the surgeons would remove her arm we were shocked , we could n’t believe it			2
‘ as a parent you want to protect your children but we were being told the only way to remove the cancer was to amputate her arm , have it driven across a city to another hospital before being driven back and sewn back on			1
‘ we did n’t want to scare @entity6 so we told her that she was having a sleep , which she got used to , and we told her when she woke up her lump , we did n’t say cancer , would have gone			2
’ she added : ‘ we were terrified enough and that is all we told her , after the operation and when she recovered we told her and she said it was great , she said it was cool			0
‘ she is n’t bothered about showing her scar now , but protects it and does n’t let people hold her arm , just me or her dad			0
‘ she wants to be a nurse now when she is older and i hope she can do that			0
’ @entity6 , who was only told about the details of her operation afterwards , said : ‘ when mum and dad said the doctors cut my arm off i just thought “ that ’s cool ”			2

i ’m really looking forward to skipping with my friends again when i get back to school			0
‘ i really want to be a nurse when i grow up			0
it ’s cool what they do			0

the arm was then packed in ice before being rushed by ambulance to the @entity72 in @entity19 which specialises in radiation therapy			1
a team of doctors put the arm through intense radiation to kill any existing cancer cells before removing the tumour			2

she has gone through so much for such a little girl but she has never stopped smiling			0
’ @entity6 has weekly physiotherapy sessions and could have a platinum bone inserted into her upper arm when she turns nine if she struggles to move it			1
mrs @entity6 added : ‘ she has no feeling in the top of her arm , her bones are dead , but the lower arm is fine , you would n’t know anything is different , she ’s lost about 30 per cent mobility but she can have 85 per cent mobility if she has an operation when she is nine			2
@entity6 ( pictured with her mother , @entity20 ) has now been declared cancer - free but she will have to have regular follow up scans until she is 18 @entity6 is hoping to return to school full - time in september			1
