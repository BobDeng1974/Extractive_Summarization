a top justice judge has said that @entity2 women should have the choice to be paid to be a surrogate mother			1
speaking at the @entity6 in @entity7 on friday night , justice @entity5 told a room full of journalists that surrogacy laws currently in place need a major overhaul to prevent cases of abandonment			1
she said she believes that because commercial surrogacy is banned in @entity2 , hopeful parents are forced to enter into unlawful arrangements overseas			1
' if we allow it in @entity2 , we then can regulate it and ensure that it 's done on ethical terms			1
' her statement is backed up by a recent bout of child abandonment cases , where parents have refused to carry through with overseas surrogacy deals			1
this week an @entity2 couple were slammed after they left a baby boy born to their @entity42 surrogate with his mother after she unexpectedly gave birth to twins			0
documents revealed the shocking details of the case that saw a couple return to @entity2 with a baby girl while leaving her twin brother behind			0
justice @entity5 ( pictured ) has spoken out about @entity2 's surrogacy laws the couple reportedly told staff they wanted a baby girl to ' complete their family '			1
they was told the boy would be left stateless if they followed through on plans to abandon him , because @entity42 does not recognise surrogate children as citizens			0
the @entity42 case is similar to the controversial baby @entity22 scenario			1
@entity22 was born in @entity67 to a surrogate mother , however after reportedly learning that he had a disability , his @entity2 parents , @entity2 couple @entity71 and @entity72 , only brought his twin sister home with them			2
the @entity76 returned to @entity2 with @entity22 's twin sister @entity77 , while ms @entity78 remained with @entity22 in @entity67 's @entity80 province			2
mr @entity72 , a convicted child sex offender , retained custody of @entity82 late last year after an investigation by the @entity84			0
@entity86 pictures with his @entity67 surrogate mother @entity78 during a trip to the beach in november , @entity2 child protection minister @entity90 said there would be ' continual and rigorous testing ' of a safety plan that had been developed for @entity82			0
following these cases the @entity67 government passed a law criminalising surrogacy and prohibiting foreigners from seeking surrogacy services			0
the law , which prohibits the act of hiring women commercially to carry foetuses to term , aims to stop @entity67 from being a surrogacy hub for foreign couples			0
currently in @entity2 , it is illegal for women to act as surrogates , except in the @entity109 where there are no laws in place to stop the act			2
in @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 , arranging a contracted surrogacy overseas is also considered a criminal offence			0
child protection officials in @entity2 are still conducting an ' extensive and rigorous ' assessment into the welfare of @entity22 's twin sister @entity77 , pictured with @entity72 and @entity122 ' i think the government could eliminate some of the worst aspects of international surrogacy by devising some ethical requirements that need to be met before intending parents are permitted to bring a child back into @entity2 , ' justice @entity123 said			1
justice @entity123 also said @entity2 surrogacy should be legalised as many of the children who are currently born to surrogates overseas will never get the chance to meet their biological mothers			2
' that child is never going to know their biological mother , and in those cases , there is absolutely no opportunity for them ever to find out , ' she said			0
' the knowing the biological parentage for me would be one of the first steps and i think we have a responsibility as a country to make sure the worse aspects of commercial surrogacy are overcome			2

top judge said @entity2 commercial surrogacy needs to be legalised
justice @entity5 said current surrogacy laws need to be *scrutinised*
she believes it will stop abandonment cases like that of baby @entity22
it means it can be done on ethical terms and avoid legal *complications*
