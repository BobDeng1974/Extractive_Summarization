teenager @entity0 scored on his home debut as @entity2 moved to within two points of @entity5 leaders @entity6 with a hard - fought 26 - 14 win over @entity8 in front of a bumper 18,350 crowd at @entity11			1
@entity0 , drafted in for only his second senior appearance as a replacement for shoulder injury victim @entity14 , was among five different try scorers as the @entity2 overcame the absence of skipper @entity18 to condemn @entity8 to a third defeat in six matches			1
@entity21 proved an able deputy for the injured @entity18 , scoring a try and kicking three goals , but @entity2 ' hero was @entity27 prop @entity26 , who also scored a try and proved a real handful for the visitors with his powerful running and skilful ball handling			1
teenager @entity0 scored the second try for @entity2 on friday night @entity2 , who handed a recall to full - back @entity36 pending the outcome of a disciplinary investigation , were good value for their fifth win of the campaign but could never relax against their injury - hit opponents			1
the home side made the brighter start without finding the finishing touches and @entity8 , captained by @entity2 - born hooker @entity49 , opened the scoring from their first real attack , with centre @entity52 breaking clear to get the supporting @entity54 over after 10 minutes			2
@entity54 kicked the conversion and added a penalty six minutes later after @entity26 was pulled up for a high tackle on @entity57 to make it 8 - 0			0
however , the @entity59 made a hash of the restart and never touched the ball for the next eight minutes as @entity2 struck a purple patch with three tries			2
substitute @entity65 went over for the third try for @entity2 @entity26 , who qualifies for @entity67 , got the first , following up a grubber kick on the last tackle by hooker @entity70 and was also involved in a sweeping move that was finished at the corner by @entity0			1
the former @entity74 forward then produced a superb short pass to get substitute @entity65 over and @entity21 kicked his second goal to make it 18 - 6			0
@entity8 finally managed to stem the tide and struck back four minutes before the break when left winger @entity79 caught @entity57 ' kick on the full to dive over for a spectacular try , which was goaled by @entity54 to cut the gap to just two points			0
defences got on top in the second half , with @entity8 having to do most of the work as the @entity2 gained the momentum			2
referee @entity89 gave the visitors a team warning after they conceded a string of penalties and the pressure told on the hour when @entity21 stretched out of a two - man tackle to score his side 's third try			0
@entity21 was off target with the conversion attempt but succeeded with a penalty five minutes later after he was tackled by @entity8 's @entity101 from an offside position			0
@entity101 was sin - binned for the offence and the @entity2 made the most of their man advantage when substitute @entity107 forced his way over from dummy half with 11 minutes to go .			0
