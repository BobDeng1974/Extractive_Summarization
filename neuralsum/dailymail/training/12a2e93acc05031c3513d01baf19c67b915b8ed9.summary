by @entity0 published : 11:33 est , 27 december 2012 updated : 11:34 est , 27 december 2012 a mother has defied odds of more than 130,000 - to - one to give birth to her second @entity5 baby			1
@entity6 , 24 , welcomed her eldest daughter @entity7 into the world on december 25 , 2009 , but was stunned when her little sister arrived exactly three years later			2
against the odds : @entity6 with her daughters , who were born on @entity5 exactly three year apart the perfectly timed @entity5 presents both came later than expected for @entity6 and her husband @entity13 - having originally shared the same due date of december 19			2
@entity7 , was born at 9.05am and weighed 5lbs 12oz , while the couple 's latest arrival , who they have not yet named , weighed 5lbs 11oz and was born at 10.30pm			1
the proud mother , who gave birth to both girls at @entity23 's @entity22 , said yesterday : ' i used to joke with my friends that this baby would come early on christmas day again			1
' but that was only supposed to be a joke			0
it shows that nobody knows what is going to happen			0
' once i went into labour my husband was willing the birth to be before 12 o'clock			0
' @entity7 is quite excited - she ca n't wait to see her			0
i 'm not sure what the chances are but it 's quite a remarkable coincidence			0
' proud parents : @entity13 and @entity6 with daughter @entity7 , three , and their as yet unnamed baby girl @entity6 and @entity13 , 33 , were in the middle of celebrating @entity7 's third birthday at the family 's home in @entity23 when the contractions began			1
@entity13 , a chef , added : ' we had my sister who is a student midwife on stand - by because we knew what happened a couple of @entity50 before			0
' so when she went into labour we were in safe hands to start with and we got @entity6 straight to the hospital			0
' i was praying for another @entity5 baby - it 's brilliant			2
next year will be mad now , we 'll have two birthday parties and a @entity5 party to organise			0
' phenomenal ' : mrs @entity6 defied odds of more than 130,000 - to - one to have second baby on @entity5 ' but we would n't want it any other way - we 've had a couple of @entity5 miracles there and we feel truly blessed			1
' @entity65 said the odds of the two births both coming on @entity5 were ' phenomenal '			1
he said : ' it is a long shot to have a baby on christmas day , a one in 365 chance , but to have two born on christmas day years apart puts the odds up to a phenomenal level			1
' we would give you 133,225 - 1 chance of this happening if you came to put a bet on with us			2

5lbs 11oz baby girl arrives exactly three years after her *older* sister
both babies were born at @entity23 's @entity22 six days late
@entity65 said odds of ' phenomenal ' occurrence are 133,225 - to - one
