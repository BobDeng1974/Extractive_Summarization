the prime minister made a direct assault on the @entity9 ’s background , calling it the ‘ same old condescending , bossy , interfering , we - know - best attitude of the @entity14 socialist down the ages ’			0
mr @entity0 ’s withering reference to the @entity18 borough associated with ‘ champagne socialists ’ comes after mr @entity4 was ridiculed last year for claiming in his party conference speech to have met ordinary voters on @entity22 , a short walk from his £ 2.6million home			1
he told supporters at his party ’s spring forum in @entity44 that the @entity2 were ‘ the real party of aspiration , of working people – the party that is with you , not against you is not that bunch of hypocritical , holier - than - thou , hopeless , sneering socialists ’			1
he defended his approach , declaring : ‘ some might say , “ do n’t make this personal , ” but when it comes to who ’s prime minister , the personal is national			0
’ withering : prime minister claimed ' i know what this role needs – and i do n’t think @entity4 has it ' he added : ‘ i know what this role needs – and frankly , i do n’t think @entity4 has it ’ , warning voters mr @entity58 would ‘ be the one taking the make - or - break calls in the middle of the night ’			2
speaking at the @entity66 studios where @entity67 was filmed , mr @entity0 also compared mr @entity4 unfavourably to his predecessors , saying @entity69 was ‘ not the party of @entity70 , who built the @entity72 ... not the party of @entity74 and his ‘ white heat of technology ’ ... not even the party of @entity78 , who believed so passionately in the dignity of work			1
’ instead , he said , they ‘ were the party whose new @entity82 is a load of dead - end lives and poverty handed down through the generations ’			0
chancellor @entity89 also mocked mr @entity4 , who , when asked last week by @entity90 whether he was tough enough to be pm , replied , ‘ @entity92 , yes			2
’ @entity89 painted a picture of life under a @entity95 , describing it as : ‘ hell – yes , indeed			0
