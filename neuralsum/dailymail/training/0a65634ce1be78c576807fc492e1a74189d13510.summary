had @entity1 been manager of any other major club in @entity3 , there is every chance he would be out of his job now			1
the powerhouses , from @entity7 to @entity8 to @entity9 , do not suffer the kind of season @entity11 have endured without taking ruthless action , and defeat like the one against @entity13 would have been the end for @entity1 anywhere else			1
@entity7 , remember , sacked @entity16 after a dreadful 3 - 1 defeat against @entity18 at the same stage of the @entity20 two years ago			1
like @entity32 and @entity33 , they do things in what i believe to be the right way			1
history shows they do not panic or make kneejerk reactions : even @entity41 was not sacked when @entity11 were relegated to the old second division in 1974			1
but just because @entity11 have not panicked does n’t mean they wo n’t be anxious and nobody knows what the @entity45 family are thinking			1
@entity1 deserves until @entity47 to show he can be a success but , as a wise football man , he will be aware losing makes positions become untenable			1
watching @entity11 labour against @entity13 brought back memories of the situation @entity55 experienced in his brief stay at @entity32 in 2010 ; the shock home defeats , the unexpected cup exits and certain players letting the manager down badly			1
the way @entity63 , for instance , is playing reminds me of the way @entity66 was with @entity55			1
his goal record might be good , as was @entity66 ’ for @entity55 , but the quotes that he has made and the stories surrounding him make it feel like @entity71 is n’t behind @entity1			1
he did n’t miss a game last season in the @entity74 but this year he has been in and out – is he thinking about the @entity75 ? – while his demeanour has served only to increase the perception there are problems			0
@entity66 did exactly the same			0
if a manager loses his players , there is often no way back and an issue @entity1 has to contend with at the moment is the fact he is the focus of the criticism ; @entity11 ’s players will know this and can hide behind that , rather than looking at their own shortcomings			1
again , that happened with @entity55			1
to see @entity1 now , he looks shell - shocked			1
the @entity94 i knew at @entity96 would never have been so amenable in television interviews after seeing his side perform as badly as @entity11 did in @entity99			1
when he was at @entity96 , you would see the anger in his face and his answers would be short			0
you knew he felt let down by his team but , equally , you knew he would drag a response out of his team			0
setback : @entity96 were comprehensively beaten by @entity108 in the @entity109 last year under @entity94 response : but @entity96 stunned @entity111 just seven days later in the @entity74 last season , after losing to @entity108 in the @entity109 , @entity96 beat @entity111 2 - 0 seven days later			2
that ability to galvanise was one of @entity1 ’ great strengths			2
a year earlier , after @entity32 had beaten them in the @entity109 semi-final , @entity96 responded the following week with a 4 - 4 draw at @entity118 , having looked dead and buried			2
he would n’t accept his team just falling away			0
before the game in @entity99 he spoke about @entity11 being compact but the team he picked had two wingers and two strikers – if a manager plays that system and gets a result , he is regarded as brave			2
if it backfires , he is naive			0
it is almost as if he ’s caught between the @entity11 way and his own mentality			2
he is not a front - foot manager – that is not a criticism , as neither is @entity136 – but there does n’t look to be any fizz or fight about @entity11			2
they do n’t look to be one thing or the other			0
i ’d go as far as to say this is the slowest @entity11 side i have seen and in @entity144 they looked like a team of old men coming to the end			1
facing @entity11 used to be unnerving , as you never knew how they would play			2
look familiar ? @entity11 's performance in @entity3 in midweek was like watching @entity32 under @entity55 beaten again : @entity11 face a fight to stay in the @entity20 after losing 2 - 0 to @entity13 last week blow : @entity152 peels away to celebrate after scoring @entity13 ' second goal against @entity11 if they wanted to pass you to sleep , they would do it without a problem			1
but if they wanted to pick you off on the break , they had the speed and cutting edge to shred you to pieces			0
the two signings of @entity167 and @entity168 wo n’t change that , as they do n’t have pace			0
@entity1 , it must be said , is also having no luck – the deliberate deflection that aided @entity13 's first goal epitomised how things are going – and he has said that often in press conferences - but is he just genuinely unlucky or is he a manager who comes up short ? he did a magnificent job at @entity179 and took them to the brink of the @entity74 before losing the play - off final against @entity183 in 2001 ; the work he did in reviving @entity96 was beyond question but in those legacy - defining games – @entity187 ( 2005 ) , @entity7 ( 2009 ) , @entity32 ( 2012 ) – it was just one hurdle too many			1
it is not unusual , of course , for managers to have poor first seasons at big clubs before turning things round			0
@entity194 , @entity195 ( @entity196 apart ! ) and @entity197 all found life difficult at @entity199 but there was no sense they were ever in trouble			0
they were given the confidence and belief to build their projects and that is what @entity11 are doing with @entity1			1
deep down , though , he and his board will know they ca n’t keep on losing			0
he needs an attention - grabbing victory , the kind @entity11 used to achieve regularly , to settle the nerves			2
on the same page ? @entity63 criticised his team - mates after their defeat in @entity99 nothing beats winning a cup final during @entity220 ’s game with @entity221 last sunday , an award was made on the pitch to @entity223			2
as he ’d just celebrated his 80th birthday , he ’d been invited back for the day and was given a thunderous ovation			0
@entity223 is held in great affection at @entity228 because he was the manager who led @entity220 to victory in the @entity23 in 1985			2
@entity220 were also relegated that season but that did not change @entity223 ’s place in the affections of their supporters			0
stuff dreams are made of : @entity220 's @entity236 and manager @entity223 celebrate at @entity237 in 1985 would @entity223 have been invited back had @entity220 ’s campaign in 1984 - 85 simply ended with them staying up and not winning a trophy ? football is all about the moments @entity220 experienced 29 years ago and tomorrow @entity243 has a chance to achieve something similar with @entity246 , the club who were on the receiving end of @entity223 ’s greatest day			1
they go into the @entity23 final in the bottom three but @entity243 ’s squad can put themselves alongside @entity252 and @entity253 , the heroes of the 1973 @entity109 - winning team , if they pull off the shock of the season and beat @entity111			1
i understand that huge financial rewards nowadays have changed how the game is perceived but the glorious moments , like @entity223 ’s boys of 1985 and @entity263 and @entity108 last may in the @entity109 , must continue to be what we love about football			0
the game is about winning things ; that ’s what you dream of when you are a kid , of running around @entity237 with a cup			1
i played in the @entity74 and in @entity3 all my career but nothing can beat the feeling of parading a trophy with your supporters at the end of a final			1
if @entity246 are relegated in may but beat @entity111 on sunday , i know which memory will last longer 30 years from now			1
time to shine : @entity246 reached the @entity23 final by beating @entity11 on penalties my top five ... things to keep me busy i thought when i stopped playing that i would have more time on my hands but , if anything , i ’ve been even busier than before			1
1 going to @entity286 – i ’ve taken an interest in rugby union since i was bowled over by the intensity of the @entity291 tour last summer and last week i got to sample my first live game			0
it was a great experience seeing @entity294 beat @entity295 13 - 10 at @entity286 and the atmosphere was fantastic			0
i will certainly be going back in the future			0
big win : @entity294 celebrate after seeing off @entity295 at @entity286 in the @entity299 2 pulling on my boots ... again – i thought my appearance in @entity303 ’s testimonial last august would be my final game but i ’m appearing in the ‘ @entity305 ’ in @entity306 this wednesday			0
@entity307 , @entity308 , @entity309 and @entity310 head an all - star cast and i ’m looking forward to the game			0
3 @entity313 about @entity314 – @entity314 is one of the most fascinating sportsmen of the modern generation and , as was the case when he was in the ring , there are no punches pulled in his autobiography @entity321			0
i like reading sports books and this is one of the best i ’ve read in a while			0
pulling no punches : @entity314 was the youngest ever heavyweight champion of the world read all about it : @entity314 has written an explosive autobiography about his life in and outside of the ring 4 reminiscing in @entity331 – i made a flying visit to @entity333 with @entity334 on thursday for a night in the @entity335 , talking about our careers at @entity32 and , of course , that night in @entity196			2
as you would expect , there was a lively crowd and a good night was had by all			0
5 keeping an eye on @entity294 – international friendlies might not be to everyone ’s interest but i will be watching the game against @entity348 closely when i get home next week from @entity306			0
@entity55 will experiment but he will also want to get a clear picture of who will start in @entity352 against @entity353 when the @entity75 campaign begins .			2

at @entity7 or @entity8 , @entity1 would have been fired by now
watching @entity11 in @entity3 was like watching @entity32 under @entity55
this is the slowest @entity11 side i *'ve* ever seen
as @entity246 prepare to face @entity111 at @entity237 , nothing beats the feeling of winning a @entity23
