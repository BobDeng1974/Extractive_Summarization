a woman who regrets an affair with a married man has put a basque he bought her up for auction - and told the full story of its sordid history in the process			1
@entity9 , 40 , from @entity10 , who is happily married to the father of her three children , put the worn lingerie on @entity14 in a bid to put her past behind her and move on			1
now a mother , @entity9 says she wants to rid herself of the gifts the 40 - year - old gave her when they had an illicit relationship 15 years ago			1
@entity9 , 40 , is selling a basque on @entity14 that was given to her by a married man she once had an affair with she also slams the £ 400 basque up for sale , calling it a ' piece of tat '			1
it was sold for £ 17 last week her tongue - in - cheek posting for the £ 400 @entity31 corset provides a lengthy 500 - word description of the product and pokes fun at the man who bought it for her			1
she writes : ' it was sold for £ 400 to 40 - year - old man 15 years ago who clearly suffered from an expensive mid-life crisis			1
' now older and wiser , @entity9 admits she regrets accepting the gifts and ' betraying his wife '			1
she writes : ' i have shoved this and several other items as listed above in the attic hoping the guilty memories would fade			0
i feel rotten for betraying his wife and accepting these gifts , even if she was as rancid as he claimed			2
' fast forward 15 years … i 'm 40 now and i have three kids			1
she was probably doing her best			0
what 40 - year - old woman is still a wildly fun ride with her husband after multiple children ? ' the events photographer reveals the last time she wore the basque was in 2007 - before her ' udders tumbled towards my lower ribs and before the abs were nicely coated in cellulite and sagging skin '			1
the advert on @entity14 in which @entity9 reveals was bought for her while she had an affair with a married man the wording on @entity9 's @entity14 advert for the used underwear - which finally sold online for £ 17 not going for a hard sell , she describes the basque up for sale as a ' piece of tat ' that ' makes lovely fleshing breasts appear purple '			1
remarkably , it sold for £ 17 last week			2
in a interview with @entity81 , @entity9 revealed how she accepted the gift as naive young woman and thought the man was just looking for someone to talk to as he was unhappily married			1
' it was about a year of me counselling him over frothy alcoholic cocktails at the @entity90 in @entity91 , ' she said			2
' i was broke so very glad to play the counsellor in exchange for a chair at @entity10 's elite hotel bars in exchange for a good meal and a drink that would have cost a week 's wages			1
' as well as raking her on expensive dinner dates , he also showered her with gifts including a laptop , several @entity106 scarves , a @entity108 coat , a @entity110 ring and a @entity112 dress			2
when he bought the purple basque , @entity9 realised he wanted more than just to talk			1
' i like to think that my companionship was really enough for him , but once the underwear started to roll in it was clear that he wanted to work with other body parts too , ' she revealed			0
@entity9 is selling the underwear on @entity14 - as well as other items she received from the married man ' i once let him put his tongue in my mouth which was a revolting experience and managed to use my wits to prevent him from ever doing that again			1
' their dates were brought to an abrupt end when his wife discovered they had been meeting			0
' his wife found receipts @entity137 day and revealed to the entire turkey feasting table what she had discovered , ' @entity9 said			1
' his phone was confiscated and i was contacted			0
' @entity9 was left with a wardrobe full of designer gifts and a guilty conscience			1
so now she 's decided to make something positive out of the situation by selling the items he bought he to fund a new business venture			2
' i 'm ebaying it all to fund my start - up ourfri.com			1
it 's an app that among other things will help you get good recommendations on where to buy good underwear - for , say , @entity159 's , ' she explained			2
@entity9 has promised to upload more of the gifts onto the online auction site in the near future including a @entity163 she describes as ' incredibly out of fashion ' and a @entity108 boucle jacket ' which belongs on some middle aged lunching @entity167 victim '			1
her @entity106 scarf is currently on sale - with all proceeds going to charity			2
' thank you for looking at this piece of smutty lingerie			2
' i have worn it only while drunk			0
try standing with it on , flat foot in broad day - light			2
' it has been used in bed , only man on woman			2
if you are bi-curious or strictly lesbian , i 'm quite sure she might find this frock as stupidly excessive as i did			0
in fact it 's a completely pointless item			0
this ad poked fun at the garment , rather than made it sound sexy ' chances are that you 'll only wear this drunk as well and if you are chances are he / she are in the same boat and will barely notice you have it on			0
if they do notice , beware , they may want to take a shot of you with their phone and we all understand the dangers of that			0
' this piece of wasted time really only pleases the designer who made it			0
' it was sold for £ 400 to 40 - year - old man 15 years ago who clearly suffered from an expensive mid-life crisis			1
' he bought it for the 25 - year - old shop girl on @entity219 he was trying coax to the @entity221 with multiple extravagant gifts			1
' by the way , i may also @entity14 a laptop , several @entity106 scarves , black knee high boots , a @entity108 coat , a @entity110 ring & a @entity230 for @entity112 dress from the same benefactor			1
' i have shoved this and several other items as listed above in the attic hoping the guilty memories would fade			0
' i feel rotten for betraying his wife and accepting these gifts , even if she was as rancid as he claimed			0
fast forward 15 years … i 'm 40 now and i have 3 kids			1
she was probably doing her best			0
what 40 - year - old woman is still a wildly fun ride with her husband after multiple children ? ' i have n't worn this thing since 2007 , before i had the children , before my udders tumbled towards my lower ribs and before the abs were nicely coated in cellulite and sagging skin			1
i tried @entity256 at £ 50 a session with a bully instructor			0
i 've tried the roll on ' instant results ' stomach spreads you have to import from @entity263			0
jogging gives you ' jogger 's face ' , that sunken hollow look that may mean you 've got a fit body , but hell your face looks like the thing @entity271 groped in room 237			0
' this lacy @entity274 piece of tat is a reminder that 118lbs will possibly be mine once more just before the mortician decides what shade of beige cake to coat my face in for the ' last view '			2
' to quote @entity285 , ' every dog has its day ' , mine has past			0
' perhaps you 've still got a few days left			0
i suggest heels here , dim lights and a bottle of bourbon			0
i 'm not too bothered about what this thing sells for , but if it does fetch anything at all i will use it towards buying a swim costume that cleverly hides the python wrapped around my waist			0
' i 'm simply relishing the idea of shoving this purple mistake in an envelope and hoping that with it , i can forget how hot i was once and just be happy that i 'm still too young for @entity303 pants			0
' bidding starts at 99p			0
i will offer free shipping to anyone buying it from at least 10,000 miles away			0
