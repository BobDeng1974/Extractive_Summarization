by @entity0 last updated at 5:24 pm on 26th january 2012 tragic : @entity1 , @entity1 , was killed in a car crash in @entity3 in 1997 a former @entity5 chief has given evidence at a @entity8 inquiry into the death of princess @entity1 to answer allegations that he suppressed evidence in the investigation into the crash that killed her			1
lord @entity15 , the @entity5 's commissioner between 1993 and 2000 , said he - along with former assistant commissioner sir @entity16 - voluntarily offered to provide witness evidence to the @entity8 @entity18			1
the pair have long faced accusations from former @entity22 boss @entity21 , whose son @entity23 also died in the august 1997 @entity3 crash , that they deliberately withheld evidence from the @entity8 investigation into their deaths			1
both men went to the inquiry to explain why they failed to disclose the existence of a note in which @entity1 predicted her own death			0
@entity15 said : ' sir @entity16 and i volunteered to go to @entity3 as witnesses to help the @entity8 authorities explore and then bring to a conclusion these repeated complaints made by mr @entity21			1
' we trust that our evidence was helpful , and we both sincerely hope that for all concerned , including mr @entity21 , some closure can be finally brought to this tragic case			2
' in 2009 a @entity8 inquiry into the investigation into @entity1 ’s death heavily criticised the @entity8 authorities and the @entity8 state was ordered to pay almost £ 5,000 in compensation to mr @entity21			1
judges found there were problems in establishing that @entity53 , the couple ’s chauffeur who also died , was drunk at the time of the accident and a mix - up with his post-mortem examination and blood tests created unnecessary delays			0
the new @entity8 inquiry is being led by judge @entity62 , mr @entity21 said			2
mr @entity21 ’s claims that evidence was withheld centre around a letter - dubbed the @entity67 note - which was written by @entity1 ’s divorce lawyer @entity67 after an october 1995 meeting outlining her fears that there was a plot to kill her in a car crash			2
witnesses : both @entity15 ( left ) and sir @entity16 ( right ) said they hoped their evidence would help bring about some closure of the case crash scene : the underpass in @entity3 where @entity1 , @entity23 and their chauffeur @entity53 were killed in the 1997 accident grief : former @entity22 boss @entity21 ( left ) has always said he believed there had been cover - up surrounding the death of @entity1 and his son @entity23 ( right ) in his statement issued yesterday mr @entity21 said : ' his ( judge @entity89 ’s ) interviews of @entity15 and mr @entity16 are the beginning of a thorough investigation by the @entity8 authorities into why @entity67 ’s letter was not provided to the initial @entity8 inquiry			1
' as the father of @entity23 and a good friend of the princess , i trust that the outcome of these @entity8 investigations will be that those who are guilty will be properly punished			0
' lord @entity67 passed on the letter to police in confidence following a meeting with @entity15 after the @entity1 ’s death			0
@entity1 's former butler , @entity108 , produced a note from the princess making very similar allegations it was only when @entity1 ’s former butler , @entity108 , produced a note from the princess making very similar allegations in the @entity115 in october 2003 that the police agreed to hand the letter over and that december it was sent to the coroner investigating the princess ’s death			0
' removing or concealing evidence ' which could ' facilitate the discovery of a crime ' is punishable by up to five years in @entity8			2
mr @entity21 has always said he believed there had been a cover up			0
a source close to the @entity8 inquiry told @entity127 : ' mr @entity21 has always maintained that the evidence of @entity67 has been concealed from the @entity130 coroner and the @entity8 authorities			1
' it is his belief that the police officers sat on it for six years until they were forced to disclose it following the revelations of @entity1 's butler @entity108			0
' ever since the evidence of the note was revealed by mr @entity21 has pressed the @entity8 authorities to investigate those responsible for its suppression			1
' at the @entity130 inquest into the deaths , mr @entity21 implicated many establishment figures in the plot to kill or cover up the murder of the couple .			0
