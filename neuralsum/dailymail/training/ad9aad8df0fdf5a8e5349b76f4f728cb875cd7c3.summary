drivers at drunken - driving checkpoints do n't have to speak to police or even roll down their windows			1
they just have to place their license and registration on the glass , along with a note saying they have no comment , wo n't permit a search and want a lawyer			1
at least , that 's the controversial view of a @entity14 attorney			2
@entity15 contends the commonly - used checkpoints violate drivers ' constitutional rights			1
he and an associate have created a website detailing their tactics			2
doubts over the legality — and wisdom — of the tactics have been expressed by legal experts and local authorities			1
@entity15 , of @entity42 , said his goal is not to protect drunken drivers , but to protect the innocent			1
he says some of his clients who passed breath - alcohol tests still faced @entity24 charges because the officer said he detected an odor of alcohol or the person had slurred speech			1
' the point of the card is , you are affirmatively asserting your rights without having to speak to the police and without opening your window , ' he said			1
not surprisingly , this does not sit well with law enforcement officials who insist drivers must speak in order to make the checkpoints work			1
and , they point out the @entity66 @entity65 in 1990 upheld the use of random @entity24 checkpoints , concluding they do n't violate constitutional protections against unreasonable search and seizure			1
' they would n't be allowed out of that checkpoint until they talk to us			2
we have a legitimate right to do it , ' said sheriff @entity76 of @entity77 , president of the @entity79			0
' if i was out there , i would n't wave them through			0
i want to talk to that person more now			0
' license and registration : police officer @entity86 looks at a driver 's license he requested during a drunk - driving checkpoint in @entity89 in @entity90			1
a @entity14 dui attorney contends the commonly - used checkpoints violate driver 's constitutional rights the widely viewed video was shot december 31 at a checkpoint in @entity97 , @entity14 , by @entity15 's associate @entity98			1
in it , @entity98 approaches the officers with the flyer , his license , registration and insurance card in a plastic bag dangling outside the slightly open car window			1
the officers briefly examine it with a flashlight and then allow him to continue			0
in bold type , the flyer states : ' i remain silent			2
' police across @entity14 have seen the video			2
a spokeswoman for a large metro police agency says @entity98 's experience at the checkpoint does n't mean the no - talk tactic is legitimate			2
' he was allowed to proceed because he clearly was not driving while intoxicated , ' said @entity122 , spokeswoman for the @entity123			0
' if those officers had reasonable suspicion to believe that the driver was impaired , they would have investigated further			0
' there have been other incidents of motorists refusing to speak at @entity24 checkpoints around the country			1
right to remain silent : @entity15 holds up a flyer he designed during an interview in @entity134 , @entity14 , in january			1
the attorney contends drivers do not need to speak with police at @entity24 checkpoints fair dui : attorney @entity15 holds a book he wrote during an interview in @entity134 , @entity14 in the @entity144 , some drivers resist cooperating at @entity146 checkpoints miles from the @entity148 border that are aimed at finding immigrants in the country illegally			1
based on differences in @entity24 laws , @entity15 has created versions of his flyer for 10 states with more on the way			1
there are no comprehensive statistics on how many drunken drivers get caught at checkpoints , which are usually announced publicly in advance and must adhere to a strict set of court - approved rules			0
for example , the @entity165 uses a ' neutral ' method of selecting which drivers get stopped , such as every single vehicle or maybe every third vehicle			0
the @entity171 uses the ' chute ' method in which 10 cars are randomly diverted from a busy thoroughfare to a side road and checked simultaneously by officers , followed by 10 more			0
at a recent checkpoint , @entity171 sgt. @entity178 said it 's as much about deterrence and visibility as making @entity24 arrests			1
@entity178 has frequently brought bad news to a family when someone is killed or seriously injured by a drunken driver			0
stop : a @entity89 police officer guides vehicles through a drunk - driving checkpoint in @entity89 ' i 'm the one that has to knock on somebody 's door and see the pain that person has to go through , ' he said			2
legal experts said it 's unclear whether @entity15 's tactics will hold up in court			1
@entity201 , a former @entity89 state and federal prosecutor now in private practice , said most states consider driving a privilege and drivers give up some rights			2
' you may have to roll your window down and interact with officers , ' @entity201 said			0
' these guys are all pushing the envelope			0
' @entity15 , however , said to his knowledge his flyers have been successful every time they have been used			2
his goal is not to challenge or confront police , he said			0
' i 'm not anti-cop			0
i 'm anti-bad government and anti-bad cop			0
i support good cops , ' he said			0
' i would like if police did n't waste their time with something like checkpoints and would focus their attention on violent crime			0
' follow @entity228 on @entity229 : @entity230			0

attorney @entity15 , of @entity42 , says drivers can assert their rights without having to speak to police at a @entity24 checkpoint
he *suggests* putting a card outside the window when pulled over
@entity241 is his license , registration and insurance and his right to stay silent
@entity247 *claims* saying just one word to police could get you in trouble
legal experts question his tactics
