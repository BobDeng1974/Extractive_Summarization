@entity0 would like to point out that @entity1 , the heir apparent to his own @entity3 legend , would be only too happy to accommodate @entity4 , who has just defended the ‘ regular ’ @entity6 world super-bantamweight title with a quick - fire ko			1
however , @entity0 makes it clear that there would be more chance of that @entity11 happening if @entity4 ’s promoter @entity15 would ‘ stop posturing on the internet and engage in proper discussion			1
’ @entity15 expressed being ‘ keen to make @entity22 ’ in his most recent @entity17 column but @entity0 says : ‘ @entity15 has not responded to our invitation to take part in meaningful talks			0
‘ he keeps twittering that he wants this fight for @entity4 but the social media is no way to conduct serious negotiations			2
on top : @entity4 successfully defended his @entity6 super bantamweight title in @entity30 ‘ @entity15 did make one early offer to us but it was derisory			1
i invited him to meet with us immediately for sensible talks but he said he had to go abroad for another fight			0
so i suggested an appointment the following week ... but he never came back to us			0
‘ since then he ’s kept saying in public how eager he is to do this fight but we ’ve still heard nothing from him			2
we would be delighted to get it on but do they really , really want it ? i doubt it			0
‘ @entity4 ’s a good fighter but @entity1 is special and i believe he would knock him out			1
i suspect @entity15 thinks so , too			0
’ both boxers impressed in their most recent fights , each with second round @entity46 , in a rocking @entity47 , @entity1 took out @entity49 ’s former two - time world champion @entity48 in a final eliminator for the @entity52 world title			1
pummel : @entity4 was too good @entity53 at the @entity54 @entity11 ? @entity4 could fight @entity1 ( right ) in a huge world title showdown then , on saturday in @entity30 , @entity4 made his statement by halting @entity58 challenger @entity57			1
unless they can be brought into the same ring , each will move on to alternative championship fights			0
@entity0 is in talks with @entity52 belt - holder @entity63 , who has declared himself willing to come to @entity47 for a big - money stadium defence against @entity1 later this summer			1
@entity15 is eyeing a unification fight for @entity4 with @entity67 , who has been soundly beaten by @entity1 but has come back to lift the @entity69 title			1
@entity15 hints , also , that he is holding his own talks with @entity71			0
the @entity73 public are already hungry for @entity74 but it would appear that boxing politics are again at work here			1
there is no mention of @entity4 making the logicial step up to meet full @entity6 champion @entity81 , nor of @entity1 taking that route			1
in all honesty that is probably a wise precaution on the part of both @entity85			0
@entity87 ’s former two - time olympic gold medallist was one of the greatest amateurs of all time is now in a brilliant class of his own in the professional super-bantam division			0
he , too , has offered to make the trip to @entity47 but it would be foolish for either @entity1 or @entity4 to take on @entity81 at this stage of their development			1
and while @entity99 is potentially a big - money match at the moment , it will be even hotter box office if the meeting waits until they both hold world titles			1
not that the great @entity0 ever ducked or delayed fighting anyone on his way to the pinnacle			0
and he says : ‘ i never want to be drawn into the politics or arguments like these			0
but in this case i find myself having to make the case for @entity1			2
‘ we are caught up in the cross-fire of rivalry between two television networks , @entity115 where @entity1 is appearing , and @entity116 , with whom @entity15 has an exclusive deal and who do n’t want @entity4 to fight on another channel			1
‘ but i have to make it known that @entity1 will gladly fight @entity4 if they are willing to do it			1
’ boxing politics : a number of obstacles need to be overcome if @entity4 is to fight @entity1 , like tv channels it also has to be said that while both are exciting prospects , the quality of their latest victims left something to be desired			1
@entity48 baled out after his first taste of @entity1 ’s power , staying down on one knee and then claiming he had misunderstood the ten count			2
@entity53 was a very late replacement against @entity4 , struggled as a consequence to make the weight and appeared drained and weak as soon he took a heavy shot			2
of the two of them @entity1 , who has yet to win an alpha - belt , looks more mature than @entity4 at this point in their careers			1
@entity149 continues to defy all - comers , @entity148 included			2
already , at 49 , the oldest boxer to win a recognised world championship , he has now became the longest in the tooth to unify two titles			1
he did so on saturday by not only outclassing @entity156 ’s @entity155 in @entity157 but decking , in the process , a challenger 19 years his junior			0
thus he added the @entity6 light - heavyweight title to his @entity69 belt			2
breathtaking : @entity149 beat @entity155 to unify the world light - heavyweight titles unloading : @entity149 battered @entity155 in their @entity6 & @entity167 light heavyweight title fight in @entity157 so on to 50			1
his birthday is in january , when he will become eligible for senior citizen benefits in @entity171			0
expect him to fill in the gap by fighting , and probably defeating , @entity174 in @entity175			0
even if he does not make it to his half century still wearing the belts , his place in the pantheon as the ring ’s oldest champion will surely never be challenged			2
@entity182 won the world heavyweight championship by knocking out @entity184 at 45 but relinquished the title a year later			2
and while @entity182 looked as if he was scoffing several times a day from one of his famous barbecues , @entity149 diets and trains to stay at or near his fighting weight at all times			0
way back when : @entity149 hits @entity192 at @entity193 in 2001 dust off : the @entity149 beat @entity194 at the @entity195 in @entity196 in 2004 dust off : @entity198 @entity197 out pointed @entity149 in 2008 to remain unbeaten he still looks every inch – in his case a young man ’s 31in around the waits - the modern professional boxer			1
this man , who enters the ring wearing the mask of an alien , really is a freak of nature			0
but he protects his human health by the clever way he fights , saying : ‘ boxing is a science			0
if you do n’t have to get hit , do n’t			0
you do n’t want to end up having to get someone else to count your money			0
’ it is 26 years since @entity149 lost his first professional bout and 20 years since he won his first world title , the @entity69 middleweight crown , by defeating @entity221 at extreme and for him unfamiliar altitude in the @entity224 capital of @entity225			1
he is the champion of bus - pass holders the world over and he adds : ‘ i ’m making history every day			0
’ long may he continue to do so			0
@entity230 ’s long - awaited world title shot appears to be nearing but @entity231 ’s finest could be forgiven for wishing that the fight between two @entity171 which has led to that opportunity had ended in a different result			1
brutal : @entity235 ( left ) put @entity236 in hospital after a devastating four rounds next in line : @entity230 is awaiting a world title shot @entity236 – a loser previously to @entity242 and @entity243 – might well have been a manageable opponent for @entity230 but he was blown away in four brutal rounds by @entity69 welterweight champion @entity235 and ended saturday night in a @entity245			1
@entity245 favourite @entity236 , 34 , recovered to say : ‘ if this is it for me i want it to be known that i went out to a great champion			0
’ @entity230 is now @entity235 ’s mandatory challenger and the fight is supposed to take place in july			1
if , as expected , the champion is granted a recovery - time extension of an extra twp or three months brook should not be too concerned			0
he will need to be at his absolute best against @entity235 , who packs middleweight punching power , and every minute of preparation time will be precious			0
@entity242 ’s hot prospect @entity258 continues his unusual route to the top in the @entity263 ’s show in @entity231 on saturday night			1
@entity258 fights for his third world youth title against @entity49 @entity265 at the @entity266 the holder of two @entity69 championships at this level , he goes now for the @entity271 middleweight crown			2
for the moment , the traditional progress to a @entity73 title is on hold			2
@entity258 says : ‘ a lot of people are asking me when i ’ll be fighting for a @entity277 but these fights are getting me up the ratings with the world bodies			2
’ @entity281 : @entity258 ( left ) has been taken under @entity242 's wing however , he is expected to meet @entity283 or @entity284 later this year			2
@entity286 ‘ @entity287 ’ @entity285 tops saturday ’s bill in his clash with @entity175 ’s @entity290 for the vacant @entity292 heavyweight title			0
* @entity293 and @entity294 are live saturday night on @entity115			0
it is the end of the road for boxing bin - man @entity297 following the loss of his commonwealth featherweight title to young @entity300			1
@entity301 , 34 in june , was in tears as he retired on his stool at the end of the sixth round in @entity30 on saturday night			0
once the emotions are back under control he can reflect on his admirable contribution to this hard old game , climaxed in 2010 by taking @entity312 ’s brilliant @entity311 the distance in @entity314 in his one world featherweight title shot			2
end of the road : @entity297 ( right ) was in tears after retiring during a commonwealth title fight @entity301 is one of the best - loved of @entity73 champions and it was fun for me to join him and his work - mates on an early - morning rubbish collection round in @entity325 shortly before he flew to @entity326 for the memories .			1

@entity4 should face @entity1 in a super-bantamweight title fight
@entity4 is the @entity6 champion , but @entity1 could choose @entity52 route
boxing politics could prevent @entity73 showdown from happening
@entity149 ( 49 ) became the oldest man to unify world titles
@entity230 could face dangerous @entity235
@entity242 ’s prospect @entity258 continues his route to the top
end of the road for ' boxing binman ' @entity297
