very few of us have lives interesting enough to warrant streaming them live on @entity3 , but a new app gives us the option - just in case			1
meerkat effectively turns your phone into a portable webcam and lets you broadcast live footage of whatever you point your handset 's camera towards			1
and because it connects with @entity3 , users already have a dedicated audience			1

it has a simple premise : press the @entity24 button , point the phone 's camera at a scene and a link to stream is automatically tweeted from a connected account the app was built by architecture student @entity31 and was on display at this week 's @entity33 in @entity34			1

there is also a @entity43 button to start recording at a later time			0
this tweet is posted with a [ live now ] message			0
an optional # meerkat tag is added to the end of the tweet to make it easy to find			0
that user 's followers can reply and retweet the link , to get more people involved , and watch it through the app or on a desktop browser			1
so far , streams have included @entity59 chat show host @entity57 rehearsing a monologue for @entity62 and live streams of sports			2
other more mundane , and in some cases disgusting , streams have included people riding on a bus or even picking their nose notably , some of these sports streams have been live from the event while others have simply been a live stream of the sport on the user 's tv			1
this means that people who ca n't afford a cable tv subscription could watch a game online			0
the top searches on @entity3 include # meerkat and # meerkat live sports ( shown ) so far , streams have included @entity59 chat show host @entity57 rehearsing a monologue for @entity62 , @entity89 streaming a live spin class with @entity91 and live streams of sports			1
when @entity7 first launched last month it imported a user 's @entity3 followers as well as showed who they were following			1
however , this was said to have annoyed @entity3 and the social network cut off @entity7 's access to this service			2
@entity3 recently bought a live - streaming service called @entity103 which is a direct rival to @entity7			1
meerkat has found a way around this though by adding a search feature that lets users find their favourite @entity3 users			2
notably , some of these sports streams have been live from the event while others have simply been a live stream of the sport on the user 's tv			1
this means that people who ca n't afford a cable tv subscription , for instance , could watch a game through someone 's @entity3 feed			1
the top searches on @entity3 include and # meerkat , # meerkat live sports			2
it is unclear how this would affect licensing and broadcasting laws and @entity131 has asked a lawyer and broadcasters for comment			0
@entity135 told @entity131 that it : ' focuses on preserving the value of its investment in sports broadcasting rights and , as part of this , will monitor new technologies and digital distribution methods that become available			0
' we work closely with our rights holder partners to , where appropriate , address unauthorised use			0
' other more mundane , and in some cases disgusting , streams have included people riding on a bus or even picking their nose			2
the app promotes itself as a tool for citizen journalists to broadcast live footage of news events , for example			1
this cuts out the need to film a video and upload it to @entity162 , for example			0
mr @entity31 told @entity164 his favourite use of the app was live @entity167 reporting from protests in @entity169			2
there is no limit on the length of stream but once the stream has ended it is automatically removed from @entity7 's servers - similar to jhow snapchat works			2
this means the stream is saved on the user 's phone but ca n't be accessed on the cloud via the link			1

at the moment the free app is only available on @entity194 ( pictured ) but mr @entity31 has said the team is working on developing an @entity197 version as of the 15 march , more than 91,000 so - called @entity7 - or live streams - have been tweeted , generating more than 293,800 views and 102,600 retweets according to statistics from simply measured everything that happens on meerkat happens on @entity3			1
streams will be pushed to followers in real time via push notifications			0
people can only watch it live			0
watchers can restream any stream to their followers in real time			0
scheduled streams will be distributed in the community by their subscribers			0
your own streams can be kept locally on your phone , but never on the cloud			0
everyone can watch on web			0
but people could use screen capturing software during the stream if they wanted to record and keep it			2
and , in theory , the app raises privacy concerns especially if live footage features people being filmed either surreptitiously or by accident without permission			1
there is also the wider issue of hacking			0
if a hacker was able to take control of a user 's phone and camera they could use the service to live stream any footage they wanted			1
of course , this is an issue that affects a wide range of apps , and not just meerkat , but its immediacy and live nature highlights the problem more than on other services			2
there is also potential for pornographic footage to be streamed			0
@entity7 's terms of service does n't address this directly but explained : ' you are responsible for your use of the @entity262 , for any content you post to the @entity262 , and for any consequences thereof			0
' the content you submit , post , or display will be able to be viewed by other users of the @entity262 and through third party services and websites			0
' you should only provide content that you are comfortable sharing with others under these terms			0
' in its rules it also says simply : ' be kind			0

meerkat is a free @entity194 app developed by student @entity31
it connects to a user 's @entity3 account and uses a phone camera to record
once a user presses @entity24 , a link to the live footage is tweeted
followers can then tune into the stream on the app or on a web browser
they can *additionally* reply or retweet streams to get more people involved
streams range from behind - the - scenes footage of *celebrities* to people watching *football* matches and even users picking their nose
