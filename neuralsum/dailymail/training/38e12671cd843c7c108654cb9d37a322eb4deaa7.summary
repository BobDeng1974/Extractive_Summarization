by @entity0 published : 08:22 est , 10 october 2012 updated : 09:50 est , 10 october 2012 young people who received sexual advice from @entity3 were more likely to use condoms if you worry about spending hours on @entity3 , then relax - it could be good for your health			1
the social networking site may help prevent the spread of sexually - transmitted diseases , a new study suggests			2
researchers from the @entity12 found that sexual health advice on the site encouraged condom use among teenagers , decreasing the chance of them spreading stds			1
they recruited 1,578 young adults between 18 and 24 for the study			2
some were asked to ‘ like ’ and receive news from a sexual - health facebook page called just / @entity23 , which shared articles about condom use and sexually transmitted infection testing			1
another group signed up to a facebook page called 18 - 24 news , which provided general news items targeted to the age group			0
the idea was to see whether receiving updates from a sexual health - based page - rather than a general news page - made the young adults more likely to wear condoms			1
when the researchers conducted a survey two months later , they found 68 per cent of people signed up to the sexual advice site had used condoms during their last sexual encounter , compared to just 56 per cent in the news group			1
furthermore , the proportion of sexual acts where a condom had been used was 63 per cent in the first group , but only 57 per cent in the news group			0
the study is published in the november issue of the @entity53			0
unfortunately , the effects of the sexual health information appeared to wane over time			2
after six months there was no difference in condom use between the two groups			0

‘ it is a first step in considering how to reach the overwhelming numbers of youth online , and how to maximise approaches to technology - based interventions , ’ said professor bull , of the @entity69			0
she added that many young people do n’t always have access to regular health care , yet 73 per cent use social media			1
' therefore it may provide a viable alternative to promote safe sex , ’ she said			0
young people under 25 experience the highest rates of stds in the @entity85 , according to figures from the @entity87			2
the peak age for an infection in women is between 19 and 20 years , and in men between 20 and 23 years			0
of all 16 - 19 year olds diagnosed with an @entity93 , at least 11 per cent of women and 12 per cent of men will become re-infected within a year .			0

young people who ' liked ' a sexual health advice site were more likely to use condoms than those who did *n't*
