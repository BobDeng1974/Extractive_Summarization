but does the sea hold the secret to truly great vintages ? to find out a trio of @entity12 wine lovers - a vineyard manager , a barrel maker and an oyster farmer - teamed up to test the myth , above and below water			1
barrels of a 2009 @entity19 wine were stored in two locations - one was to be kept in chateau cellars , the other sunk among the prized oyster beds of the @entity23 , on the @entity25 coast			1
the sea is the key : oyster farmer @entity28 ( left ) and winemaker @entity29 recover a wine barrel buried on the shore of the @entity12 @entity25 for six months they were tested after six months and the one stored below the sea was indeed found to be the best tasting			1
lab analysis also showed extraordinary results – showing the special combination of being submerged had changed the water - bound one by osmosis			1
‘ i had heard a bunch of stories about wines ageing at sea , ’ said @entity29 , who runs the cellars of @entity43 in the southwest @entity19 region			0
finished product : the ' @entity51 ' branded wine from @entity52 which was aged under the sea ‘ i found the whole idea amusing and intriguing			2
so when in 2009 we found ourselves with an exceptional vintage , full of rich tannins , i decided to put it to good use			0
‘ it started out as a lark among friends			0
one of us came up with the idea and the others ran with it			0
’ @entity66 , who unveiled their findings this week in @entity69 , asked his barrel - maker friend @entity70 to build him two small 56 - litre wooden barrels in which to age his red wine by an extra six months			1
@entity70 set his three top craftsmen to work on the barrels , assembling them simultaneously by hand to ensure they were strictly identical for the purpose of the experiment			2
when done - inspired by the challenge - they cycled 93 miles to @entity29 's vineyard in june 2011 with the barrels in tow to see them poured full of the 2009 vintage , already aged nearly two years by this point			2
' it was much better than it should have been ' the barrel kept at the chateau was dubbed ‘ @entity92 ’ after the @entity90 goddess of the land , and the other ‘ @entity51 ’ after the sea god			2
@entity51 was picked up by @entity29 's oyster farmer friend @entity28 and rowed out to the low tide mark , where it was chained inside a concrete chamber that kept it protected while letting the water flow in and out			0
‘ the barrel could roll around a little , ’ as it would if it were lying on the sea bed , @entity28 told the wine lovers and journalists gathered in @entity69			2
‘ it was very exposed to the wind and the weather , and it was just opposite the window of my house , so i could keep an eye on it ! ’ traditional storage : the other barrel of the same batch of wine was aged for six months in a chateau cellar during the very lowest tides it was briefly exposed to the air , around 25 or 30 times over a six - month period			1
both barrels were retrieved in january for the wine to be bottled , tasted and analysed in a laboratory			0
@entity92 turned out to be rather disappointing			0
but @entity51 was a good surprise all round			0
‘ when we tasted it , it was much better than it should have been , ’ the expert taster @entity125 told the @entity69 gathering			0
lab tests helped shed some light on the process : despite the barrel 's watertight stainless steel plug , they confirmed that the wine was subtly changed by its ocean environment through a process of osmosis			1
on the one hand the wine lost some of its alcohol content , while on the other it saw its sodium concentration rise , adding a subtly salty note that brings out the best of the tannins , @entity125 said			0
‘ in ancient times the @entity90 used to add a little salt water to their wine , ’ he pointed out			0
for @entity149 , @entity51 has yet to tell its full story			0
fine find : eleven bottles of champagne found in a shipwreck in the @entity155 in 2010 sold for £ 90,000 last week a lot of bottle : diving instructor @entity158 holds one of the 200 - year - old bottles he found ‘ we 've tasted it at a particular point in time , ’ he said			1
" but you need to see how the wine evolves over a longer period			0
’ he intends to keep checking the vintage over the coming decade - and already plans new experiments , with different wine - making processes and barrel sizes , to tease out more wine - making secrets from the sea			1
one of the earliest known sea vintages dates from the 18th century , when the @entity19 baron @entity175 sent a shipment of wine to @entity178 , whose unsold bottles returned to @entity12 mysteriously improved by the hull journey			1
the most recent - and extreme - case dates from friday , when 11 bottles of the world 's oldest champagne , salvaged in 2010 from a @entity155 shipwreck , were auctioned off in @entity186 for £ 90,000 ( $ 136,000 )			1
the six bottles of @entity189 , four of @entity190 and one of @entity192 , were preserved or even improved in the 200 years since the wreck , experts believe , thanks to the ideal conditions found on the chilled , lightless bed of the @entity155 .			2

@entity12 trio aged two barrels of identical wine for six months - one under sea and the other in chateau cellar
lab tests revealed sea wine had *undergone* different process of osmosis , giving it a *mellower* taste than traditionally aged barrel
comes after 11 bottles of champagne from 2010 @entity155 shipwreck sold for £ 90,000 at auction
