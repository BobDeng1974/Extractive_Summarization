the @entity0 wanted five americans released in exchange for five @entity4 terrorists – not just the single @entity6 infantryman now accused of desertion – according to a senior congressional aide			1
and with the @entity11 hostage swap now nearly a week old , the @entity9 is still insisting that it does n't offer ' concessions ' to ' terrorists ' or other ' hostage - takers ' @entity15 , chief of staff to @entity17 member @entity16 , a @entity19 @entity18 , said late thursday that the @entity0 aimed to free @entity20 of @entity21 , @entity22 and her baby who was born in captivity , along with her @entity26 husband @entity25 , as part of a ' broader goal			1
' also on @entity6 's wish list was @entity30 , a @entity31 man who was abducted in 2011 in @entity32			2
a @entity4 - aligned sect of @entity34 is still holding him captive			2
the @entity0 ' was looking at this in the whole scope of things , to deal with these people as well , ' @entity15 told @entity39			2
@entity47 's father received them in july and september captive : pregnant @entity20 and @entity25 are believed to have been taken by the @entity4 while traveling in mountains near @entity51 @entity52 : @entity9 deputy spokeswoman @entity53 said wednesday that ' our policy is not to make concessions to terrorists ' -- just days after the @entity59 administration traded hostages with the @entity4 but the @entity61 nixed the military 's hoped - for deal , @entity15 told @entity39 , choosing instead to trade five @entity4 for @entity11 alone			1
the @entity9 is drawing a firm distinction between negotiating for the release of @entity11 , a @entity67 infantryman , and the @entity16 family , who were not in uniform			1
@entity11 's status ' as a missing or captured soldier , ' @entity9 deputy spokesperson @entity53 said , ' is distinct from someone who , for example , may be a civilian hostage			1
' but in a blanket statement to reporters on wednesday , she said that ' we do n’t make concessions to terrorists			1
' ' so not making concessions does not preclude negotiating , ' a reporter shot back			0
' is that what you ’re saying ? ' ' this was an exchange of prisoners in war , ' @entity53 replied			0
another reporter in the room reminded her that ' every administration ' since the @entity93 opened , have parsed it out ad nauseum that these are not prisoners , these are detainees			2
' ' right , ' @entity53 replied			0
' you ’ve changed your language today and called them prisoners in war , ' the astonished reporter said			0
journalists challenged @entity53 , saying the 5 - forf - 1 @entity4 trade ' legitimizes the @entity4 to take prisoners of war ' -- and accused her of suddenly changign her language to call @entity93 detainees ' prisoners in war ' @entity110 chair sen. @entity109 believes that if the @entity61 had followed federal law and given @entity112 30 days to consider a @entity93 detainee release , more @entity6 might have been rescied @entity53 argued a hypothetical situation : ' let 's say it was important for us to get sgt. @entity11 home , ' she said			1
' let 's say these guys may have eventually been transferred somewhere anyways			0
i think many of us would make the argument – i would make it – that we should get something for them			0
' she doubled down a day later , cryptically telling @entity39 on thursday that @entity6 has a ' longstanding @entity6 policy not to make concessions to hostage - takers			1
' @entity131 wrote to president @entity59 on monday , saying that the @entity0 's broader plan for a wider hostage release never had time to mature while the @entity9 's negotiations rushed ahead			1
@entity16 , a @entity135 reservist who himself served in @entity136 and @entity137 , also suggested that the @entity0 might have won @entity11 's release without releasing terrorists at all			1
he complained to @entity59 about ' the sudden urgency behind the prisoner swap given other lines of effort offered the same opportunity for success			2
' ' these efforts should have been fully exhausted before any commitment to exchange prisoners was made , ' @entity16 wrote			0
' now a situation has been created whereby prisoner exchanges — specifically disproportionate exchanges — are viewed by the @entity4 and other aligned forces as achievable			0
' also needs rescue : sgt. @entity154 , a decorated @entity135 , has been held in a @entity156 prison for two months for taking a wrong turn and entering the country with registered weapons sen. @entity109 , a @entity19 @entity160 who chairs the @entity110 , told @entity161 on friday that if @entity112 had 30 days ' notice on @entity93 detainee releases – as federal law requires – members could have argued for the release of more @entity6			1
' there are two others in @entity137 , ' @entity109 said , according to an advance transcript obtained by @entity170			0
' one is a young couple with a baby			0
... i think they certainly ought to be part of any swap			0
' ' if there were some consultation , that could have been suggested , to get two @entity6 out ... but there was no opportunity to do so , ' @entity109 added			2
' and that ’s the 30 days , that you have an opportunity , if there are issues you want to raise or thoughts that might be helpful , actual , to the administration			1
' her interview will air friday night .			0

the @entity59 administration nixed a @entity0 request to get five @entity6 hostages – not just sgt. @entity11 – in exchange for five @entity4 prisoners
a senior staffer to a @entity18 congressman said a ' five for five ' deal was the @entity0 's goal , *including* civilian hostages as well
but the @entity9 insists the ' prisoner of war ' exchange for @entity11 is completely different from negotiating for *non-military* captives
' we do n’t make concessions to terrorists . ' a spokeswoman at @entity9 said wednesday , doubling down a day later and *citing* ' longstanding @entity6 policy not to make concessions to hostage - takers '
sen. @entity109 complained that if @entity112 had 30 days ' notice on @entity93 prisoner transfers – as federal law requires – it could have argued for the release of more americans
