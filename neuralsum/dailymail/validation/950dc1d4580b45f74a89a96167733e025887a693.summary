@entity0 was given a clean bill of health on thursday after revealing his shocking mid-game collapse was caused by the stress of his father ’s ill health			1
the @entity8 was discharged from hospital in @entity10 in the morning having fainted eight minutes into @entity12 ’s 3 - 2 defeat against @entity13 at @entity14			1
there were distressing echoes of @entity18 ’s collapse at the same ground three years ago , with @entity13 ’ substitute goalkeeper @entity20 admitting he ‘ feared the worst ’ as he watched the striker slump to the ground			1
@entity0 lies face down on the pitch after collapsing during @entity12 's game with @entity13 medical staff attended to the @entity8 international for four minutes before he regained consciousness concerned @entity13 players look on as the @entity12 forward is attended to my medical staff but hospital tests through the night have found no deeper cause for concern beyond the 29 - year - old ’s vasovagal condition , which the @entity39 club insist they have been aware of since before they signed the player from @entity41 last summer			1
a senior club source told @entity43 that knowledge of at least three previous episodes involving @entity0 in @entity8 meant they were ‘ extra rigorous ’ in testing him during his medical and cardiology exams			1
a source close to the player confirmed those tests took place in a specialist facility in @entity53 ahead of @entity0 ’s @entity55 move to south @entity39			2
the @entity8 tweeted to insist he was feeling better , claiming he fainted because of the anxiety caused by his father ’s illness			1
he said : ‘ i wanted to reassure you concerning my health			2
it actually looks much scarier than it is physically dangerous , and i am feeling well now			0
@entity0 , who has a history of blacking out , is taken off the field on a stretcher at @entity14 @entity13 midfielder @entity66 ( right ) holds his head in his hands as @entity0 is taken off on a stretcher players from both sides appear shocked as referee @entity72 prepares to restart the game ‘ i have been under a great deal of stress and fatigue due to my father ’s health , which requires me to go back and forth from @entity8			1
‘ i was disappointed that i could n’t help my team tonight ( wednesday ) , but now everything is back in order			2
i also want to thank everyone for their support and get well messages			0
’ the striker will not return to training until tuesday , though the time off was agreed for the whole squad ahead of wednesday ’s incident , with @entity12 not playing again until monday week ’s clash against @entity91			1
he is expected to return to @entity8 imminently			2
club officials were adamant on wednesday night that @entity0 has suffered no previous issues with fainting since his arrival at the @entity96 , though the dressing room had been made aware of a condition that is understood to have first affected the striker when he was 14			1
a vasovagal syncope , which is what @entity0 suffered on wednesday night , is caused by a sudden decrease in blood pressure or heart - rate , triggered by emotional or physical factors			1
reduced blood flow to the brain makes a person faint			0
it can be prompted by extreme exertion or anxiety			0
on the physical side , there are numerous tests that can be done when a player has a medical and it appears @entity12 knew all about @entity0 ’s history			1
they will have checked the flow through his blood vessels under exercise stress , though emotional triggers are harder to quantify			0
it is a rare condition for a professional sportsman and is more common in older people			0
it is not something i have encountered in any other footballer			0
thankfully , it is not an especially dangerous condition in isolation			0
the risks are low beyond what happens when you fall			0
you could hit your head or suffer trauma damage to another part of the body on landing			0
often there is a stimulus that the person will recognise and they can act , by sitting down			0
most sufferers feel fine in a matter of moments			0

@entity0 is believed to have collapsed a third time in a @entity171 match for @entity41 against @entity172 in august 2010			1
such episodes are caused by low blood pressure to the brain , usually brought on by emotional or physical distress			0
medical experts told @entity43 that the main risks associated with the condition would come from falling , though @entity12 claim @entity0 is able to detect when a problem occurring and acts accordingly			1

' it 's not normal for someone to be standing there and collapse and you know it 's going to be something serious			2
' but after a minute or so the word got back , so that 's why you did n't see the panic on the players ' faces because everyone knew he was all right			2
