it is a record shadow the lurcher could do without			0
after more than 260 days , he is the longest - staying resident at @entity3			1
the sweet and loving four - year - old lurcher is a firm favourite with staff at the charity			1
but while they are glad of his company , they are at a loss to explain why he has not yet found a home			0
plea : after 260 days at @entity16 , @entity15 was desperate to find a new home innocent : what you will be getting should you decide to take in shadow the average dog stays for 35 days – @entity15 has been there more than seven times longer			1
like 46 per cent of @entity16 dogs , @entity25 was brought in by his owners last july as they could no longer care for him			1
@entity28 , head of rehoming , said : ‘ @entity30 must feel really unloved as he ’s been here for so long and is desperate for a family to call his own			0
he ’s such a gorgeous boy and will make a fantastic companion – we just ca n’t understand why he ’s been with us for this length of time			0
‘ @entity25 ’s luck will change soon and someone will fall for his charm			0
’ friendly dog : staff at the charity can not understand why it took so long for the loving lurcher to find a home record stay : @entity25 spent seven times longer at the @entity16 kennels than the average dog to break up his time in kennels , @entity15 was placed in a foster home for two months			1
mr @entity28 added : ‘ @entity15 did fantastically well in his foster home – he ’s housetrained , travels well in the car , is very obedient and above all gave his foster parents lots of love and laughter			2
’ director of communications at the home @entity59 added : ' @entity16 puts no time limit on rehoming a dog or cat and we ’ll care for them for as long as it takes to find them what they long for the most – a loving new home			2
' sadly , if some dogs spend too long in kennels , they could start to show signs of severe stress and do downhill rapidly			0
but we will only put a dog to sleep if it has extreme behavioural problems and it is clear it is too dangerous to rehome into a family environment			1
' fortunately @entity25 is not in that situation at all and simply longs for a second chance in life			0
' so it seems while @entity15 may get to continue his life for now , it is hoped that can be in a loving family rather than the home sooner rather than later			2
new family : although staff , like welfare assistant @entity91 ( pictured ) loved @entity25 , they are thrilled he has found a home			2

the lurcher has been at the home for 260 days - seven times longer than the average stay
@entity15 is house - trained and is loved by all the staff
was put into the home after previous owners felt they could no longer care for him
only dogs with *medical* problems or severe behavioural *difficulties* will be put to sleep
