a flop sportscar has started a new life as a super pick - up truck that can go from nought to 60 in five seconds			1
two motor enthusiasts bought a 1989 @entity4 412 , usually regarded as one of the @entity8 car maker ’s least desirable models , for £ 5,000 and then spent the next six weeks creating the first @entity4 pick - up truck			1
@entity11 boss @entity10 and his mechanic friend @entity12 removed a foot ( 30cm ) of the roof and shifted everything forward to create a four - and - a - half feet load bed at the back			1
copying yachts , the back of the pick - up truck uses teak wood to panel the rear bed @entity10 and his mechanic friend @entity12 removed a foot ( 30cm ) of the roof and shifted everything forward to create a four - and - a - half feet load bed at the back they jacked up the rear suspension for extra load - carrying capability and taking inspiration from luxury yachts , they decided to use teak wood to panel the rear bed			1
@entity10 has several dozen cars in his museum built the @entity4 for his @entity40 tv series , @entity41			2
as well as the flat bed and suspension the two car fanatics swapped the @entity4 ’s 4.9 - litre v12 engine for a 5.7 - litre @entity46 from a @entity47 to give it more oomph			1
‘ the 412 is the most unloved @entity4 because it is when they tried to enter the saloon car market , ’ revealed @entity10			2
‘ they tried to make a car which was stylish and had an executive feel and it did n’t end up working out			0
a painter and decorator 's dream : the @entity4 may have been unloved as a sports car but it is ideal for a tradesman who can store his paint and ladders and make a quick getaway at 4pm - or even earlier the two car fans swapped the @entity66 s 4.9 - litre v12 engine for a 5.7 - litre @entity46 from a @entity47 to give it more oomph the bespoke sound system is another touch that makes the @entity4 pickup truck stand out from the crowd manufactured 1985 - 1989 the car got its name because 412 is the cubic capacity of each cylinder			1

‘ we are really pleased with the results , it has turned out better than i thought and it is only at the second glance that you see it is a pick - up truck			0
‘ people are loving it , we ’re getting so much interest in it and it is going to take pride of place in the @entity11			0
' the @entity4 also has a shotgun scoop bonnet and bespoke exhaust system resulting in a dual - personality of high performance hot - rod and practical workhorse			1
this feature moves up and down and the unique exhaust has a valve system whereby the driver can decide at the flick of a switch whether to have the exhaust growl fiercely or produce a more refined sound for @entity11 ’s leafier avenues			0
the souped - up @entity4 pickup truck does not look out of place in even the most salubrious of areas a builder who needs to get somewhere in a hurry ? the @entity4 pickup truck could be just what is needed the unloved @entity4 412 : at least one has been given a second lease of life as a pickup truck			2
