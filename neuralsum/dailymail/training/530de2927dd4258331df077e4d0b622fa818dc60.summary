by @entity0 a family was left distraught after their five - month - old @entity2 ate their £ 400 holiday money the day before they set off			1
@entity6 has a habit of eating everything he can find from socks to skirting boards			2
so when mother - of - two @entity12 left cash for a four - day holiday to @entity15 on the kitchen counter , he could n't resist			1
shock : @entity12 , 37 , and her sons @entity19 , three , and @entity20 , six , with @entity6 who ate £ 400 of their cash it was n't until she and partner @entity23 , 36 , came home to pack that they discovered what had happened			1
ms @entity12 , 37 , said : ' it just disappeared			1
there was n't a trace of it , not a corner of a note or anything			0
' we spent ages looking before we realised @entity6 must have eaten it			2
' determined to go on the holiday with their sons @entity20 , six , and @entity19 , three , they left the puppy at home in @entity43 , @entity44 , with mr @entity23 's mother @entity45			1
incredibly , by the time they returned £ 375 of the cash had emerged intact - and @entity49 agreed to put the chewed - up cash back in their account			0
despite emergency surgery since , to recover an eaten sock , the remaining £ 25 has not been found			2
the family had been planning to spend the money they saved during a four - day trip to @entity15 ms @entity12 added : ' we thought ' oh no we are going on holiday with no money , that 's really bad ' - but it was okay , it did n't ruin our trip			1
' we managed to get enough money together so it was alright			0
' as we queued to get on the plane we heard that @entity67 had got about £ 300 back , by the time we returned it was £ 375			0
' the last £ 25 has disappeared			0
' we took the money to @entity49 and although the notes had been chewed up and stuck back together they put the money in our account , which was really good of them			0
' despite recovering the money , ms dear , who runs an estate agents with mr @entity23 , said : ' @entity6 will be our first and last dog			2
' he honestly eats everything and we are n't actually sure what to do about it			0

@entity12 , @entity23 and two sons were going to @entity15
ms @entity12 , 37 , took out £ 400 to *change* into euros at the *airport*
left on kitchen top , came home to find @entity6 had eaten it all
