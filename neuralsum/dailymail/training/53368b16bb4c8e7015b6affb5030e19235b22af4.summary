by @entity0 an @entity2 artist has exposed her most private moments in a series of self - portraits that portray her eating behind closed doors			1
the thought - provoking images , painted with almost photographic realism , depict the artist in different secret bingeing scenarios			2
in one she 's surrounded by cupcakes on the sofa , another shows her lying on a bed covered in fast food wrappers and in others she 's eating in the bath and even in the loo			1
self portrait : this painting shows artist , @entity23 , bingeing on jam doughnuts @entity23 from @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity2 , who painted these compelling pieces ' grappled with eating disorders ' growing up and wanted to explore the complex relationship some women have with food through her art. ' when i ’m having difficulties in my life food is still how i deal with things , ' admits the artist , now 47			1
' it 's not the severity that it was , but i might grab a pint of @entity42 without thinking			2
' ' the paintings are very personal , ' @entity23 tells @entity44			1
' they explore compulsive behavior			2
i use food as the focus , but any number of other things could stand in for food			0
' the art of bingeing : the images are all set in private places - including the toilet - as in the image above ' they 're about the multifarious ways we check out			0
we use food to seek solace , but then our search for comfort turns into a way of not being present in the moment , ' she explains			0
the artist believes that women 's relationship with food is central to the relationship we have to the world			1
' by portraying women involved in as intimate an act as eating , i am exploring a broader context of women ’s situation , ' she explains			1
the lifelike paintings are a narrative on women 's relationship with food ' my paintings , i hope , point the viewer toward asking what we are truly hungry for , and what might be a healthier way of expressing that hunger , and seeking out its satiation , ' she says			1
although the images are about secrecy and compulsion , the artist does n't associate her paintings with shame			1
' in fact , there ’s a kind of defiance in the gaze in many of the paintings , ' she says			0
' i get various interpretations , ' says the artist			0
' many people miss the connection to emotional eating my paintings represent			1
' then i get tonnes of emails from people – men and women both – who respond on a very personal level to the content of my work			0
both responses resonate for me			0
' the artist depicts herself enthusiastically snacking on her bed in her pyjamas ' what ’s important to me is not so much how people take them in , but simply that they take them in , each in their own way , ' she says			0
what also stands out in the images are the unusual settings -- the bathroom , toilet and bedroom are n't your typical eating spots			0
' i wanted to use a private place , a peaceful place of solitude , and set against it this frenetic activity of compulsive behavior in which the subjects are engaged , ' explains @entity23			2
@entity145 take - away in the bath			0
what 's not to love ? ' the irony then becomes that in the midst of the chaos of their behavior there is peace			0
the women just ca n’t see that , ' adds the artist			2
the mesmerising images are currently being exhibited at @entity159 in @entity25 , @entity26			2
