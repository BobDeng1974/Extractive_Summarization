by @entity0 published : 16:31 est , 5 october 2013 updated : 16:31 est , 5 october 2013 trapped in their overturned tank , just metres from the @entity4 trenches , captain @entity1 and his crew already faced an impossible situation			1
but , after three days of attack from their enemies , the brave men in charge of the @entity11 tank were plunged into even greater danger when their @entity16 allies started bombarding them as well , to destroy the tank before the @entity4 could get it			1
astonishingly , though , all but one of the soldiers survived the impossible odds , armed with just pistols and a single rifle , managing to escape the death trap to become the @entity25 's most decorated tank crew			2
war machine : the crew was stuck inside the early tanks , which helped turn the tide of the @entity25 by smashing through enemy fortifications ( file photo ) impression : this sketch illustrates the overwhelming odds faced by the @entity37 crew the heroes aboard the tank nicknamed @entity40 made scattered headlines months after the struggle in july 1917 , but their story then languished untold for decades			1
but it has now been revealed by family historians at findmypast.co.uk , who dredged up records of the heroic struggle			0
they were able to uncover captain @entity1 , second lieutenant @entity50 and the rest of their crew had rushed towards the enemy lines when their tank got stuck in a bomb crater and fell on its side			1
the fall rendered the tank 's on - board guns useless , and the injured men were trapped inside while the tank 's metal armour endured constant assault from machine guns , sniper rifles , grenades , heavy artillery and even dynamite			1
high technology : the early tanks , seen here advancing , were powerful but unreliable in one particularly deadly moment , a @entity4 soldier managed to climb on the overturned tank and drop a grenade inside , but a crew member managed to hurl it back out before it exploded			1
the men survived by sharing their meagre rations and drinking water from the tank 's radiator			2
they were also faced with extremes of temperature ranging from 30 degrees @entity86 in the day to below freezing point at night			0
decorated : the battle was described in the @entity89 in 1918 after their first night under fire , a flare sent up by @entity16 forces showed the men that they were surrounded by @entity4 soldiers , eager to take over the stranded tank			1
realising they had little chance of survival if they stayed inside , the men managed to make their escape by crawling through the mud one - by - one to make it back to their own lines			0
a report on the battle from the @entity107 in january 1918 said : ' for three days and nights , captain @entity1 along with another officer and the crew , continued to hold the enemy at bay			2
' they were heavily sniped , and the @entity4 actually got on top of the tank , but could not get inside , nor did the bringing up of a machine gun subdue the defenders , one of whom was killed and all the rest wounded			1
' @entity121 , a family historian from findmypast.co.uk said : “ at this point in the @entity25 , tank technology and warfare was incredibly new			0
' captain @entity1 and second lieutenant @entity50 led a charge of eight tanks and theirs was the only one that survived attack by @entity4 artillery			0
' it is astonishing that they managed to survive the initial attack , let alone 72 hours of attacks from @entity4 troops , especially when you consider that they only had basic weapons to defend themselves			0
' the tank crew became the most decorated of the whole @entity25 , and it would seem , rightly so			0
crippled : the @entity40 had been turned on its side , so could not use the tank 's on - board weaponry ( file photo ) victory : tanks took pride of place in parades to celebrate the end of the war , including this 1919 procession down @entity155 ' there ’s a story waiting to be told in every family , and old newspapers are a great way of unearthing them			0
' the @entity37 crew was awarded two military crosses , two @entity164 , and four @entity165 – the most awarded to one tank crew during any action of the war			2
captain @entity1 and second lieutenant @entity50 were both awarded the @entity170 for their role in leading the defence of the tank and for bringing most of their crew back safely .			0

the crew of the @entity37 were trapped after their tank fell on its side
they were attacked constantly by @entity4 machine guns and *explosives*
even @entity16 guns tried to destroy the tank to keep it from enemy hands
but all but one of the men *miraculously* escaped the deadly situation
