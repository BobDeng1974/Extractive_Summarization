the £ 200million - a - year @entity15 , which pays for drugs refused by an @entity18 spending watchdog , will now continue until 2016			1
it meant that wealthy people with cancer were able to receive the drugs by laying for it themselves but less well - off patients were barred			1
mr @entity0 said the fund , which has already been used by 35,000 patients , was saving lives			1
speaking after meeting cancer patients young and old at the @entity25 , in @entity14 , the @entity0 said : ’ people have lived longer and in some cases it has saved people 's lives			1
’ i just met one man from @entity54 who would n't be here were it not for the @entity57 and the treatments that he got			0
he is now cancer free			0
’ the scheme was set to run until 2014 and campaigners raised concerns about where patients will turn to when the funding ceased			2

’ it has also addressed some of the historic inequities that have existed for people with rarer cancers , ensuring that access to treatment is not denied simply because you are unlucky enough to have a rare form of cancer			2
’ not everyone is pleased with the fund and with one journal calling it ' the product of political opportunism and intellectual incoherence ' so far about 35,000 patients have benefited from the fund and the charity estimates that 16,500 extra patients will benefit each year as a result of the extension of the funding programme			2
