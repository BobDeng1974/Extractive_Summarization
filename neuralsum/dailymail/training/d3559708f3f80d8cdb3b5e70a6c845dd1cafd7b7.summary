three - parent babies risk the future of the human race and put @entity5 at odds with @entity8 law , politicians from across @entity1 have warned			1
mps from @entity10 claim the ' human species as a whole ' will be affected by the controversial technique , while meps in @entity15 warn it violates ' human dignity and integrity of the person '			1
but ahead of a vote on the law in the @entity22 , former archbishop of canterbury @entity23 dismissed the ' unfathomable ' opposition and vowed to defy the @entity27 's line to back the idea			1
graphic shows how the three - parent baby process works			2
however critics argue there is a small risk of diseased mitochondria could be carried over too ( point 4 ) mps last month voted in favour of @entity5 becoming the first country in the world to permit the creation of @entity41 babies with genetic material from three different people , despite warnings from some experts warn it would be an ' historic mistake '			1
scientists at @entity48 have developed a way of swapping the mother - to - be 's diseased mitochondria – the ' batteries ' that give cells energy – with healthy ones from another woman 's egg			0
supporters stress that mitochondrial dna is 0.054 per cent of a person 's overall dna and none of the nuclear dna which determines personal characteristics and traits			1
@entity64 backed the law change , insisting it was not ' playing @entity67 ' but the chance to hep parents have a ' healthy and happy baby '			2
but some 50 @entity14 have written to the prime minister calling for him to withdraw the legislation , which is due to be debated in the @entity22			1
@entity23 , the former archbishop of @entity73 , is firmly in favour of three - parent babies @entity77 mep @entity76 has called on the @entity78 to ' take steps ' over @entity5 's ' lack of compliance ' with @entity8 law			1
in the letter he and 49 other meps said : ' we are writing to you to express our profound concern at the intention of the @entity5 to permit the modification of the human genome			1
' your proposals violate the fundamental standards of human dignity and integrity of the person			1
' meanwhile a group of @entity10 mps have also called on the @entity22 to vote against the plans			1
in a letter to @entity101 , they warned the technique ' could have uncontrollable and unforeseeable consequences , affecting future generations and modifying genetic heritage in an irreversible way , inevitably affecting the human species as a whole '			1
the letter added : ' the greater part of the scientific community maintain that the scientific data currently available is insufficient to even consider intervention on human subjects , and there can not therefore be any guarantee for the safety of any eventual off - spring '			2
however , supporters of the technique have rejected the idea that the global scientific community is opposed to mitochondrial donation			0
@entity23 said he was surprised that @entity27 in the @entity22 were preparing to support a delaying motion from the @entity123 peer @entity122			1
in an article in the @entity125 , he said : ' it would be received by families as a cruel and unnecessary delay after seven years of investigation , consultation , parliamentary discussion and scrutiny			0
' he added : ' much opposition is coming from well - organised campaigns from @entity123 from @entity135 and @entity1			0
but if we can not make any alteration , then we will deny ourselves the possibility of ever improving life for those who suffer from these intractable conditions			0
' turning our backs on these advances is uncaring and unloving			0
we live in an exciting time for medical research and we must support caring scientists and doctors with the resources and proper regulations to do their work			0
' mitochondrial donation would allow @entity41 babies to be born with dna from three different people should be made legal			1
the technique involves replacing dna in an egg in order to prevent devastating inherited mitochondrial diseases			1
what are @entity160 ? mitochondria are tiny rod - like structures in cells which act as power houses , generating the energy that allows our bodies to function			0
unusually , they have their own dna , distinct from the genetic material within the cell nucleus			2
@entity172 ( @entity172 ) makes up about 0.1 % of a cell 's total dna and does not affect individual characteristics such as appearance and personality			2
what causes @entity179 ? harmful mutations in mitochondrial dna can prevent the mitochondria working properly , resulting in a number of diseases some of which can be serious and life threatening			1
they may affect major organs and cause conditions ranging from poor vision to diabetes and muscle wasting			0
how are @entity179 diseases passed on ? children may inherit mitochondrial dna defects from their mothers , but not their fathers			1
people with faulty @entity172 can develop symptoms or be carriers of the condition without experiencing ill - effects themselves			2
what is @entity204 ? defective @entity172 from a mother 's egg can be replaced with healthy @entity172 from a donor			0
this will then prevent the harmful mutations being inherited and passed onto future generations			1
what are the techniques involved ? there are two different procedures , one carried out before fertilisation and the other after			0
@entity217 ( mst ) involves first removing the nuclear dna from a donor egg whose mitochondria are healthy			2
the ' spindle ' of chromosomes containing the mother 's nuclear dna is then taken from her egg and inserted into the donor egg			2
as a result , the donor egg is left with nuclear dna from the mother and @entity172 from the donor			2
this healthy egg is then fertilised and implanted into the mother 's womb			0
@entity234 ( @entity234 ) is similar but in this case the mother 's egg is fertilised first			0
its nuclear dna is then transferred to a fertilised donor egg , containing healthy mitochondria , whose own nuclear dna has been removed			0
this healthy fertilised egg is then implanted			0
@entity244 is @entity204 ? animal and laboratory experiments suggest that the procedures are safe , but no - one can say that the risk is zero			0
three separate reviews by an expert panel convened by the @entity251 and @entity252 have found no evidence that the techniques are unsafe for clinical use			0
critics argue that problems might only arise once the procedure is used to create human babies			1
for instance , replacing @entity172 might have more of an impact on personal traits than had been envisaged			0
unknown epigenetic effects , environmental influences that alter the way genes work , may also have serious consequences for the health of babies , it is claimed .			0

@entity22 to vote on babies being born using dna from three people
it can prevent serious diseases from being passed down to children
if legalised , @entity5 will become first country to *approve* new process
@entity10 mps claim the ' human species as a whole ' will be affected
@entity14 in @entity15 say it violates ' human dignity and integrity of the person '
but @entity291 of @entity73 to defy @entity27 line to back the new law
