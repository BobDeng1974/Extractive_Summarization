by @entity1 reporter last updated at 1:20 pm on 29th december 2011 the @entity2 has insisted that it will not allow @entity3 to choke off one of the world 's busiest shipping routes in revenge for sanctions imposed on the country over its secretive nuclear programme			1
last night an @entity2 military official said that ' any disruption will not be tolerated ' in the @entity13 , which is used by 40 per cent of the world 's oil tankers , and where @entity3 is currently holding a 10 - day war games training exercise			1
and a @entity18 spokesman warned that @entity3 would destroy its own ' economic lifeline ' if it disrupted the international oil trade			1
tensions rose after @entity3 ’s top naval commander bragged that shutting down the @entity23 to oil tankers would be ‘ easier than drinking a glass of water			1
’ and they have continued to escalate today , with @entity3 revealing one of its surveillance planes has recorded video and photographed a @entity2 aircraft carrier near the area it is carrying out the drill			0
warning : tensions are rising as @entity3 said it recorded video surveillance of a @entity2 aircraft carrier near the area it is carrying out the drill drill : @entity3 is holding a 10 - day military exercise in international waters beyond the @entity13 - the passageway for one - sixth of the world 's oil supply training : the military drill has sparked a row between @entity3 and the @entity2 gestures : @entity3 's army navy commander @entity48 spoke to reporters during the @entity51 war game on the @entity52 near the @entity13 the report did not provide details and it was unclear what information the @entity3 military could gleam from such footage			1
but the announcement was seen as an indication @entity3 is seeking to cast its navy as having a powerful role in the region 's waters			2
the threats have triggered an angry response from the @entity67 , based in @entity68			0
‘ anyone who threatens to disrupt freedom of navigation in an international strait is clearly outside the community of nations ; any disruption will not be tolerated , ’ said a spokesman for the @entity68 - based fleet			0
‘ the free flow of goods and services through the @entity13 is vital to regional and global prosperity , ’ he added			0
@entity82 dismissed the @entity3 boasts as an attempt to draw attention from its nuclear ambitions			0
tensions : a military helicopter flies over a submarine during the @entity51 war games by the @entity3 navy in the @entity13 today military personnel place an @entity3 flag on a submarine in the @entity94 , as tensions escalate over the country 's apparent design of nuclear weapons lookout : a submarine performs naval maneuvers on the @entity52 during naval exercises in international waters if @entity3 were successfully to block access to the @entity13 , the price of crude oil would almost certainly rise dramatically			1
around a third of all oil shipped in tankers passes through the strait , and if this supply were disrupted it would out immense pressure on the rest of the world 's supplies			1
following a mistaken report that the strait had already been closed , the oil price jumped by $ 2 , to over $ 100 a barrel			2
although it then fell back , the price is set to rise even if the @entity13 remains open , as sanctions on @entity3 and @entity121 restrict the global supply			1
a senior @entity124 official has insisted that @entity23 nations will be able to make up for any shortfall caused by the sanctions , but this would be of little use if @entity3 succeeded in cutting off the strait			2
the ongoing uncertainty is set to make 2012 another volatile year for the oil markets , following the disruption to supplies caused by the @entity134 throughout 2011			0
playing down the threat , a @entity136 spokesman said : ‘ @entity3 politicians regularly use this type of rhetoric to distract attention from the real issue , which is the nature of their nuclear programme			2
’ @entity144 warned a week ago it would shut down the strategically vital shipping lane if the @entity146 took tougher action against @entity3			1
vice president @entity148 said @entity3 would n’t allow ‘ a drop of oil ’ to pass through the strait if sanctions were widened			2
the row ratcheted up another notch after admiral @entity48 , head of the @entity3 navy , declared that ‘ closing the @entity13 for @entity3 ’ s armed forces is really easy – or as @entity3 say it will be easier than drinking a glass of water			1
’ the comments drew a quick response from the @entity2 , with @entity18 press secretary @entity161 saying : ' this is not just an important issue for security and stability in the region , but is an economic lifeline for countries in the @entity23 , to include @entity3			2
' @entity3 media have described how @entity3 could move to close the strait , saying the country would use a combination of warships , submarines , speed boats , anti-ship cruise missiles , torpedoes , surface - to - sea missiles and drones to stop ships from sailing through the narrow waterway			2
@entity3 's navy claims it has sonar - evading submarines designed for shallow waters of the @entity23 , enabling it to hit passing enemy vessels			1
a closure of the strait could temporarily cut off some oil supplies and force shippers to take longer , more expensive routes that would drive oil prices higher			0
it also potentially opens the door for a military confrontation that would further rattle global oil markets			0
but @entity194 , spokesperson for the @entity195 , responded : ' it 's another attempt to distract attention away from the real issue , which is their continued non-compliance with their international nuclear obligations			0
' @entity203 tensions with @entity3 have increased since a @entity205 report claimed last month that @entity144 appears to have worked on designing an atomic bomb			1
@entity3 strongly denies this and insists it is developing nuclear energy for peaceful purposes			0
practice : @entity3 military personnel pictured during training exercises threat : an @entity3 politician claims the country 's military is preparing to close off the @entity13 the possibility of imposing sanctions on @entity3 has divided @entity205 members			1
@entity3 has defiantly expanded nuclear activity despite four rounds of @entity205 sanctions meted out since 2006 over its refusal to suspend sensitive uranium enrichment			1
many diplomats believe only sanctions targeting @entity3 's lifeblood oil sector might be painful enough to make it change course , but @entity230 and @entity229 - big trade partners of @entity144 - have blocked such a move at the @entity205			1
the @entity232 has passed a bill banning dealings with the @entity235 , and president @entity236 has said he will sign it despite his misgivings			0
critics warn it could impose hardships on @entity2 allies and drive up oil prices			0
the bill could impose penalties on foreign firms that do business with @entity3 's central bank			2
@entity248 and @entity249 nations import @entity3 oil and use its central bank for the transactions			2
the threats to close the @entity13 coincided with a 10 - day @entity3 naval exercise in the @entity13 and nearby waters , a show of military force that began on saturday			1
' our enemies will give up on their plots against @entity3 only if we give them a firm and strong lesson , ' mr @entity148 said			0
important : around a third of the world 's shipped oil passes through the @entity13 around a third of all shipped oil passes through the four mile - wide @entity13 between @entity267 and @entity3 and @entity2 warships patrol the area to ensure safe passage			1
former @entity2 vice-president @entity271 said president @entity236 should have ordered an airstrike over @entity3 after their refusal to hand back the unmanned spy plane that crashed last month most of the crude exported from @entity124 , @entity3 , the @entity279 , @entity280 and @entity281 - together with nearly all the liquefied natural gas from lead exporter @entity283 is transported through the channel			2
after a news agency mistakenly reported the strait had already been closed , crude oil prices leapt by almost $ 2 to $ 100.45/per barrel , but they later stabilised			0
last month , @entity3 's energy minister told @entity291 that @entity144 could use oil as a political tool in the event of any future conflict over its nuclear program			1
tensions over the program have increased since the @entity299 ( @entity299 ) reported on november 8 that @entity144 appears to have worked on designing a nuclear bomb and may still be pursuing research to that end			0
@entity3 has warned it will respond to any attack by hitting @entity304 and @entity2 interests in the @entity23 and analysts say one way to retaliate would be to close the @entity13			1
last month former @entity2 vice-president @entity271 said president @entity236 should have ordered an airstrike over @entity3 after their refusal to hand back the unmanned spyplane that crashed in november			0
during a @entity312 news conference with @entity281 prime minister @entity313 , mr @entity236 said : ' we have asked for it back			0
we 'll see how the @entity3 respond			0
' but mr @entity271 told @entity315 : ' the right response would have been to go in immediately after it had gone down and destroy it			0
' @entity318 : officials in @entity3 claim they can ' mass produce ' the captured @entity322 drone and build a ' superior ' version following its crash on december 4			0
