a prehistoric sea creature that swam the oceans almost 250 million years ago has been dug up near @entity2 in @entity3			1
it 's believed to be the first amphibious ichthyosaur - reptiles that could live both in and out of the water - filling an important gap in evolution			1
the predators roamed @entity10 at the time of the dinosaurs and moved to the water after starting out as land creatures			1
a prehistoric fossil has been found at the @entity16 near @entity2			1
an expert says it could be the first amphibious ichthyosaur ( illustrated )			1
these were reptiles that could live both in and out of the water			2
if confirmed it would fill an important gap in evolution			1
the predators roamed @entity10 at the time of the dinosaurs however , there were no fossils marking this transition until the new species was unearthed			1
the ancient marine reptile , with seal - like flippers , may have been adapted to life on the land as well as in the sea , scientists believe			2
its relatives were dolphin - like creatures that swam in the oceans at the time of the dinosaurs			2
they are thought to have had terrestrial ancestors , but previously no fossils had come to light marking the transition of ichthyosaurs from land to sea			2
the @entity51 - @entity50 extinction , which occurred around 250 million years ago , was one of the biggest catastrophes that caused a majority of the land and aquatic species to become extinct and is more commonly known as the ' @entity57 '			1
the causes that triggered the event have remained a mystery			0
some scientists have suggested the mass extinction was caused by an asteroid strike or a volcanic eruption in the area now known as @entity66			2
they claim this led to a significant rise in greenhouse gas emissions and caused the mass extinction of @entity10 â€™s species			1
research from earlier this year , however , suggested that microbes began belching out the greenhouse gas methane - which is about 20 per cent more potent than carbon dioxide			0
these fumes could have suddenly spurted from the oceans and wiped out the huge number of animals			0
whatever the cause , the event is known to have wiped out 96 per cent of species on @entity10			1
today , all life is descended from the 4 per cent of species that survived			0
' now we have this fossil showing the transition , ' said lead scientist professor @entity88 , from the @entity89			2
at 1.5ft ( 0.46 metres ) long , @entity91 lenticarpus was also the smallest known ichthyosaur			2
@entity94 - meaning fish - lizards - ranged greatly in size and could grow up to 30ft ( nine metres ) long			0
superficially they resembled today 's dolphins and whales			0
they were very different to @entity91 with sharp teeth in long jaws and big eyes			0
they had four crescent - shaped fins , a stabilising dorsal fin and a fish - like tail with two lobes			0
its fossil remains were dated from the start of the @entity113 period about 248 million years ago and were found in @entity114 near the @entity16 about 150 miles ( 240km ) from @entity2 in @entity3			1
as well as big flippers , @entity91 had flexible wrists which would have been essential for movement on the ground			0
while most ichthyosaurs have long beak - like snouts , the new specimen possessed a short nose that may have been adapted to suction feeding			0
its body also contained thicker bones than other ichthyosaurs			0
this supports the theory that most marine reptiles that left the land first grew heavier to help them swim through rough coastal waves			2
the fossil remains were dated from the start of the @entity113 period about 248 million years ago and were found in @entity114 near the @entity16 about 150 miles ( 240km ) from @entity2 in @entity3 ( shown ) called @entity91 lenticarpus it is the smallest known ichthyosaur			1
the fossil ( shown ) dates back 248 million years , four million years after the ' @entity57 ' mass extinction event that wiped out 96 % of species			1
these animals moved to the water after being land creatures but until now no fossil marked this transition the animal lived about four million years after the worst mass extinction in history , shedding light on how life on @entity10 survived			1
the @entity51 - @entity50 extinction , known as the ' @entity57 ' , wiped out 96 per cent of all species and may have been linked to global warming			1
scientists have wondered how long it took for animals and plants to recover after such destruction - particularly since the extinction was associated with global warming and ocean acidification			0
understanding how reptiles such as this survived could be important for our own future , according to professor @entity88			0
' this was analogous to what might happen if the world gets warmer and warmer , ' he said			0
' how long did it take before the globe was good enough for predators like this to reappear ? ' in that world , many things became extinct , but it started something new			0
these reptiles came out during this recovery			0

a prehistoric fossil has been found at the @entity16 near @entity2
an expert says it could be the first amphibious ichthyosaur

the predators roamed @entity10 at the time of the dinosaurs and moved to the water after starting out as land creatures
there were no fossils marking this transition until this species was found
called @entity205 , it is the smallest known ichthyosaur
the fossil dates back 248 million years - four million years after a mass extinction event called the ' @entity57 ' that wiped out 96 % of species
