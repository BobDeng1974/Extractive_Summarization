the partner of @entity2 star @entity1 today won her @entity4 battle with her ex-husband over the alleged cut price sale of their luxury @entity8 home to the footballer			1
property tycoon @entity12 claimed the £ 5.5million sale of the family home in central @entity8 to a company owned by @entity1 was at least £ 2million under value and sued his ex-wife @entity17 for compensation			1
but deputy judge @entity19 said such a claim ' has no real prospect of success ' and dismissed it			0
he said the claim ' is yet another court battle between mr @entity12 and ms @entity17 arising out of the breakdown of their marriage in 2011 which led to their acrimonious divorce in 2013			1
' @entity1 's girlfriend , @entity17 ( left with @entity2 player ) , has won a @entity4 battle with her ex-husband , @entity12 ( right ) after she sold her former marital home to the footballer the judge said mr @entity38 still owed ms @entity17 nearly £ 1million of a lump sum in a divorce order and legal costs of more than £ 500,000			1
ms @entity17 , 39 , is currently pregnant with @entity1 's second daughter			1

in january last year , @entity4 judge mr @entity45 gave the go - ahead for the sale of the former family home in @entity49 to a @entity51 firm @entity50 owned by mr @entity1			1
in a preceding hearing , mr @entity12 had claimed the property was being sold at ' significant undervalue ' , claiming it was worth up to £ 10million and at least £ 7million			2
but in allowing the sale , the judge said mr @entity12 ' has a history of lacking credibility '			2
deputy judge @entity58 said he had failed in a bid to appeal a previous ruling and had now launched these new proceedings			0
but he still owed his @entity67 born ex-wife almost £ 1million ordered to be paid as part of a £ 1.4million lump sum in divorce proceedings , the court heard			1
ms @entity17 originally hooked up with @entity1 in @entity68 when he played with @entity69 and she took her two children , aged 14 and 10 , by mr @entity12 with her			1
a row centred on a property in this @entity8 street , where ms @entity17 and mr @entity38 used to live ms @entity17 flew to @entity68 to be with @entity1 when he played for @entity69			1
they have since had a daughter they returned to @entity8 last summer after the player 's £ 27million move to @entity2			0
in a previous case , mr @entity45 ordered the sale of the @entity81 listed flat in april 2013 when mr @entity12 was ordered to pay his ex wife £ 1.4million to buy a new home			2

he also claimed a higher price was achievable			0
also in april 2013 , mr @entity12 lost his bid to appeal against the financial settlement when he claimed that @entity1 would be keeping her in the future			2
