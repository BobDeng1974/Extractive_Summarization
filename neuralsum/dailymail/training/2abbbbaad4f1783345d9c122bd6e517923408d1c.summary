the time is 8.30am and i 'm crouching under the hand - dryers in the ladies ' loo at @entity5 frantically trying to dry my hair			2
i 've got a meeting in 15 minutes and for the third time this week i 've left the house with my hair soaking wet , plastered to my face and dripping down my neck			2
in my quest for long hair , there is no indignity i will not endure			1
the manufacturers of a new shampoo and conditioner , fortified @entity19 ( @entity20 ) , make the quite extraordinary claim that if you use it every single day , it can boost the rate of hair growth by up to 99 per cent in a month			1
my short hair makes me feel dowdy and middle - aged			2
i yearn for swathes of long , glossy , glamorous hair			1
the really awful thing is that i had gorgeous long hair until i lopped it off last april — a mistake i 've regretted ever since			1
i ended up looking like a giant earbud			0
i 'd worn my hair long for almost 20 years and when i hit 45 , i decided it was time for a radical change : either get a toyboy or cut my hair short			1
sadly , the hair went — in a misguided belief that eight inches off my locks would cut ten years off my face			1
the world 's most desirable women all have luscious locks , like @entity62 's for a while , i tried to convince myself i liked it			2
my female friends thought i looked sassy with short hair			2
one pal , @entity69 , did n't mince his words			0
' it 's the sort of cut a middle - aged woman gets when she ca n't be bothered any more , ' he said			2
brutal , but it summed up what most chaps thought			0
' men like long hair because they think it 's feminine , ' says @entity81 , an internationally renowned trichologist with clinics in @entity83 and @entity84			1
you only have to look at the women the world 's most eligible bachelors choose to marry to see that he has a point			2
@entity91 , @entity62 and @entity92 all have beautiful , long thick hair			1
so , @entity20 shampoo and conditioner and its promise of turbo - charged hair growth seemed the answer to my dreams			1
most people 's hair , grows an average of 1 cm to 1.3 cm per month , says @entity81			1
@entity103 , the @entity104 company that makes @entity20 , claims it can accelerate growth by using a blend of amino acids — the building blocks of proteins — and essential vitamins			1
this super-nourishing concoction works by feeding hair at its root and stimulating the scalp — a body - building blast of nutrients for hair			1
in clinical trials of ( an admittedly paltry ) 20 volunteers , the average rate of hair growth was 30 per cent faster than normal — though some saw growth 99 per cent faster than usual			1
@entity123 , founder of @entity103 , points out that the shampoo wo n't create new hair growth , just encourage existing hair to grow faster			1
but those in the business are sceptical			0
my hairdresser @entity129 guffawed when i told her about @entity20 promising to double the rate of my hair growth in a month			1
' does it lift your face at the same time ? ' she chortled			0
while agreeing that particular proteins and minerals in diet play an important role in healthy hair , he thinks it 's highly unlikely that a topically applied shampoo will make hair grow faster			1
you only have to look at the women the world 's most eligible bachelors choose to marry to see that he has a point			2
@entity91 , left and @entity92 , right , have beautiful , long thick hair so i decided to put fast shampoo and conditioner to the test			1
first , i measured my hair			2
taking measurements from five different places : front , back , left and right sides , and crown			0
i then averaged out the result			0
at the start of august , i had a starting length of 23.5cm			0
i also measured the rate of growth following my usual twice - weekly washing regime with my normal shampoo and conditioner			1
at the start of september my hair measured 24.4cm : a monthly growth of 9mm , slightly slower than average			1
could fast do better ? week one expert @entity170 says ' men like long hair because they think it 's feminine ' at £ 30 for a pack with 300ml of shampoo and 300ml of conditioner , @entity20 is more than double what i normally spend on my @entity181 shampoo and conditioner — £ 6 each for 250ml			1
the shampoo is a thicker texture and harder to lather			2
as per the instructions , i apply it twice , each time massaging it into my scalp			0
after rinsing , my hair feels brittle and sticky but the conditioner certainly helps soften it			1
altogether , the new routine takes an extra ten minutes each day			0
i 'm worried that washing my hair every day will dry it out , or worse , make it fall out			2
but dr @entity194 , a @entity195 trichologist , tells me not only is it ok to wash my hair every day , it 's what i should be doing			1
' do you wash your face twice a week ? ' he asks			0
after a few days , i realise why i do n't wash my hair every day			2
unlike my hair , my face does n't rearrange itself into frizzy spikes post wash — and shampooing in the mornings is a logistical nightmare			1
i end up drying my hair in public toilets and giving my eight - year - old daughter a dairy milk bar for breakfast two days in a row because of the extra time i take every morning			0
but , by day six , i think i can see some growth			0
' do you think my hair looks longer ? ' i ask @entity69			0
' no , ' he says bluntly			0
@entity212 realising i just do n't have enough time to wash my hair each morning , i start doing it in the evenings instead			0
but at the end of the day all i want to do is slump in front of my @entity219 box set with a glass or two of wine			0
instead , i find myself hogging the bathroom			0
on the plus side , my wine consumption is down , and running straighteners through my hair , i 'm convinced more ends flick up — surely a sign it 's growing ? and washing it every day has made it beautifully soft			1
it 's in better condition than it has been for years			0
week three getting my roots done , @entity129 tries to persuade me to have a couple of centimetres snipped off			0
' you need a trim			0
it 's getting quite long , ' she says			1
fast , claims it can accelerate growth by using a blend of amino acids — the building blocks of proteins — and essential vitamins i feel like kissing her			1
there 's no doubt — my hair is no longer short			1
it is n't long either			0
but it 's getting there			0
i swear i 'll never hack my hair off again			0
i know how @entity251 felt			0
it 's probably worse for me than it was for him : he just lost his strength , i lost my femininity			0
@entity258 when i measure my hair in the same places i 'm delighted to find my locks now average out at 25.6 cm , an increase of 1.2 cm. that 's 3 mm ( or 33 per cent ) more than it grew last month			1
it looks like using @entity20 has made it grow faster			2
but is it really possible that the ingredients in the shampoo encouraged my hair to grow ? trichologists are unconvinced			2
@entity81 speculates that rather than the specific ingredients it 's the massaging 14 times a week that made the slight difference , as it would have increased blood flow to the hair follicles			2
@entity274 , a @entity83 - based trichologist , says it 's more likely that conditioning my hair every day for a month is responsible for the growth			1
' there are highly protective substances in conditioners that cling to your hair and prevent ends from splitting off , making it seem as though your hair has grown faster , ' he explains			0
most good conditioners contain protective ingredients and it is n't necessary to use a super-expensive brand for stronger , longer hair , he says			0
whatever the reason , i 'm delighted			0
shampooing every day is laborious , but the joy of running a comb through hair that ends below my neck is immense			0
i 'll carry on using @entity20 ( the pack lasted just over a month ) because it seems to work			1
a bad hair day is wretched - a bad hair year does n't bear thinking about .			0
