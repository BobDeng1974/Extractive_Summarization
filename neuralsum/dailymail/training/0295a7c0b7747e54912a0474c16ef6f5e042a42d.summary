by @entity0 published : 12:02 est , 19 september 2013 updated : 12:02 est , 19 september 2013 ' robbed from her mother ' : @entity3 died from a serious infection on christmas day 2012 a mother told an inquest today she was robbed of her 22 - month - old daughter because hospital staff had not done enough to treat the transplant patient before she died of an infection			1
@entity11 and her husband @entity12 heavily criticised staff at @entity15 ’s @entity14 for the care of @entity3 , who was admitted just before @entity18 last year			1
@entity3 , from @entity15 , had been diagnosed with the rare genetic condition @entity20 , but was progressing well under the care of @entity22 in @entity23			1
she had a bone marrow transplant at @entity22 to cure the condition , which showed signs of success			1
before @entity18 however she was lethargic and was taken to @entity14 by her parents			1
but her condition worsened and when she had a seizure she was moved to intensive care at @entity32 , where she died from a serious infection on christmas day , despite attempts to stabilise her condition			1
managers at the @entity14 have changed their protocols of dealing with immuno - suppressed children in the light of @entity3 ’s death and the hospital has apologised for some of the care the toddler received , the hearing was told			2
mr and mrs @entity3 had been looking after @entity3 at home for months and were concerned about infection because she was taking drugs to suppress her immune system after the transplant in august last year			2
when she became ill , mrs @entity3 was told by @entity22 to take her to @entity14			1
@entity12 and @entity11 heavily criticised staff at @entity54 s @entity14 ( pictured ) for the care of 22 - month - old @entity3 , who was admitted just before @entity18 last year she accused the hospital of a ‘ lack of care and action ’ and she and her husband @entity12 were concerned about a lack of medical intervention and assessment as their daughter ’s condition worsened over december 23 and 24			1
she explained she had disagreed with the diagnosis of gastroenteritis and asked medical staff to note it			2
mr @entity72 said that the decision to give @entity3 oral antibiotics , which she threw up , when an intravenous dose would have been better could not be discussed because the doctor had to rush off for an emergency			1
it was not until later when @entity3 had become very ill that iv antibiotics were administered and blood tests and cultures taken			0
awful time : @entity11 , 38 , and @entity72 , 43 , are pictured outside the inquest in @entity32 today there were also hours of delays between blood tests coming back and visits from doctors , the inquest heard			1
‘ i felt i had to prompt the nursing staff to do what i considered to be basic care for an immuno - suppressed child , ’ mr @entity72 ’s statement said			1
‘ i feel completely let down by @entity14 and that no - one took what we said seriously			0
’ mrs @entity3 said she had been in complete shock and was sick when her daughter ’s condition started to deteriorate and medical staff and machines went into the room			1
‘ i feel let down , frustrated and angry at the treatment we received at @entity14			0
the level of care , particularly on december 24 , was below standard			0
‘ it seems to be that everything was done reactively and i believe this potentially resulted in her death			0
‘ i feel that @entity3 was badly let down by her home town and we were robbed of our daughter			0
’ she said the family had been ‘ completely crushed ’ by the death			0
‘ our lives and hearts have a hole that will never be filled , ’ she added			0
mr @entity72 said that doctors at @entity32 had been frustrated at the care @entity3 received at @entity15 and he said that one medic had called it a ‘ calamity ’			1
‘ we are absolutely heartbroken and distraught by @entity3 ’s death , and not a moment goes by without the thought of seeing her little face again , ’ he said			0
a post-mortem examination could not identify what was the infection that caused @entity3 ’s death and whether it was viral or bacterial , the inquest heard			0
consultant paediatrician @entity135 , who looked after @entity3 for some of her time at @entity14 , said that in retrospect there had been a lack of communication with the parents when she was admitted but he said a lot was done to treat her even though she could have been seen more regularly			0
' i feel that @entity3 was badly let down by her home town and we were robbed of our daughter ' @entity11 ‘ although we are still not certain it would have altered the outcome , we fully acknowledge it would have given more clarity to @entity3 ’s care , ’ he said			2
he said staff had recognised she was immuno - suppressed otherwise he may not have seen her and she might well have been discharged as would have happened with a healthy child			2
he said there had been a lack of communication in part because it was unusual for @entity3 not to be known to the hospital			2
staff at @entity14 did consult with @entity22 when @entity3 was admitted , the hearing was told			1
he said that there were no protocols to deal with a child like @entity3 and her condition at the time and he admitted there was a gap in the process that had now been filled			2
he said it would have been better with a immuno - suppressed child like @entity3 for medics to have made the presumption of infection and prescribed a wide - ranging iv antibiotic			0
' we are absolutely heartbroken and distraught by @entity3 ’s death , and not a moment goes by without the thought of seeing her little face again ' @entity72 ‘ the lesson we learn is that presumption should not be based on a ready to take action at the first sign of deterioration , it should be automatic and follow a certain procedure and reduce down from that , ’ he told the hearing			2
he explained that now blood and cultures were taken and iv antibiotics administered on children in similar positions to @entity3 within one hour of admission with more frequent observations			0
hurler ’s syndrome affects one in 117,000 children			0
sufferers are missing an enzyme and without treatment it means that complex sugars accumulate within the body ’s tissues , causing damage to them			0
an effective treatment is now available which involves a bone marrow transplant so that the new marrow can make the missing enzyme otherwise the condition is fatal by the time a child is 15			1
@entity32 coroner @entity214 will give a narrative verdict at a later date .			0
