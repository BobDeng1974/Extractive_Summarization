by @entity0 published : 00:09 est , 28 june 2012 updated : 06:32 est , 28 june 2012 @entity1 has finally taken the shades off and unveiled their ' goggles ' project			1
the search giant is selling early models of its @entity8 augmented reality glasses this week for $ 1,500 to a select group of developers			1
the glasses are designed to let users capture video with a built - in camera as well as use apps , the internet , and social networking sites on the move			1
a small projector displays an image in front of the wearer 's eyes while letting them stay aware on the outside world			1
the idea is to bypass computers , tablets and smartphones entirely and keep the user connected in a ( fairly ) discreet way			0
photos and video can be programmed to be taken at automatic intervals during any activity			2
@entity37 said he became excited about the project when he tossed his son in the air and a picture taken by the glasses captured the joyful moment , just the way he saw it			0
' that was amazing , ' @entity37 said			0
' there was no way i could have that memory without this device			2
' @entity1 points out that this is experimental technology , and a first generation device			1
but for those who want the cutting - edge , and are willing to try something new , the glasses offer a potentially revolutionary way of communicating			0
with the glasses , directions to your destination or a text message from a friend can appear literally before your eyes			2
you can converse with friends in a video chat , take a photo or even buy a few things online as you walk around			2
in development for more than two years , the project is the brainchild of @entity89 , the online search leader 's secret facility that spawned the self - driving car and could one day let people ride elevators into space			0
@entity96 , an engineer on the @entity8 project , said the company created the glasses for people to interact with the virtual world without distracting them from the physical world			0
it is designed to interact closely with your senses , without blocking them			0
she said @entity1 had two broad goals in mind : communications through images and quick access to information			1
the device has a camera to capture fleeting moments and allow others to see the world through your eyes			1
extreme : the @entity8 demonstration was meant to prove that the device is ready for users to begin testing it and pushing its limits going down : a team rappelled down the side of the conference center and filmed the stunt using their @entity8 eyepieces the @entity8 was n't @entity1 's only big product announcement at its 2010 @entity39 conference			1
the search giant signalled it was likely to begin competing directly with @entity133 and @entity134 with the launch of several new devices and features			2
nexus 7 this is @entity1 's entry into the tablet market			1
for $ 200 , the system runs the company 's @entity143 operating system			0
it is built to give consumers an alternative to the @entity148			2
@entity149 this black sphere plugs into the tv and allows users to stream videos from the @entity155 store and @entity156			1
at $ 300 , it costs three times what @entity158 does , although @entity149 is made in @entity161			0
android 4.1 - ' @entity162 ' a new version of its smart phone operating system is meant to look and feel more ' streamlined			0
' it also offers a version of @entity133 's ' @entity168 ' along with voice control			0
@entity37 told reporters that @entity1 intends to sell the glasses for significantly less once the product is released to the mass market			1
he said @entity1 hopes to start selling the device to consumers in early 2014			1
' i think we are definitely pushing the limits , ' @entity37 said during a question - and - answer session with reporters			0
' that is our job : to push edges of technology into the future			0
' the company showed that users are ready to start testing the limits of its new product with a dramatic demonstration			2
daredevils skydived from a blimp above the annual @entity39 conference onto the roof , then abseiled down the side of the building - all broadcast live to the conference from souped - up versions of the @entity8			1
@entity1 is offering the first shot at the the device , known as @entity8 , to people attending the @entity203 gathering for computer programmers			1
it will ship early next year and wo n't be available for sale outside the three - day conference , which started wednesday			2
' this is new technology and we really want you to shape it , ' @entity1 co-founder @entity37 told about 6,000 attendees			2
' we want to get it out into the hands of passionate people as soon as possible			0
' experience : @entity1 has already released a sneak - peak at the user - interface for the @entity8 , which broadcasts data directly in front of the eye , bypassing cell phones the demonstration shows off a weather forecast layered over a view of the world the demonstration shows off navigation information similar to what @entity1 currently offers via its @entity232 service then , another team took over and rode @entity235 stunt bikes over a ramp , which led to a team rappelling down the side of the building			1
finally , another stunt cyclist delivered one of the devices into the conference auditorium and into @entity37 's hands			0
but for all the dramatic stunts , the demonstration showed only that @entity8 is durable and capable of streaming video			0
it offered no glimpse of the device 's functionality or user interface			0
@entity1 had given a glimpse of the technology in a video posted earlier this year .			1

glass is only available to software developers who order it at the @entity39 conference this week
@entity1 hopes to start selling it to consumers in early 2014
the device broadcasts images directly in front of a users ' eyes , allowing them to stream video and social media *applications*
