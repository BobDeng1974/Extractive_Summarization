by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 06:30 est , 19 april 2013 updated : 18:23 est , 19 april 2013 the era of @entity3 as a property - owning democracy is over , according to new figures which reveal record numbers of people now forced to rent			0
levels of home ownership have slumped to just 64 per cent , its lowest levels since the mid- 1980s when @entity12 declared her ambition to see more people able to buy a house			1
the last decade has instead seen the first rise in the percentage of households renting since 1918 , the @entity16 said			1
experts put it down to first - time buyers struggling to get on the ladder as soaring prices have far outpaced incomes			1
generation rent : the @entity16 revealed how the proportion of home owners has fallen in the last decade for the first time in a century a new study into the way @entity3 lives reveals the impact of rising house prices and the limited availability of mortgages on those struggling to get on the property ladder			1
in 2011 , just 64 per cent of the 23.4million households owned their home while the remaining 36 per cent were rented			2
it is in stark contrast to the 69 per cent who were owner occupiers in 2001			0
in @entity44 , 50 per cent of households are renters , the highest in the country according to the @entity16 data			1
it marks a reversal in the way @entity3 live			0
in 1918 more than three - quarters of households – 77 per cent – rented			0
the sharp rise in ownership accelerated from 1953 onwards , with the majority lived in properties they had bought by the early 19710s			2
the number of households rose from 2001 to 2011 , with the increase entirely driven by people renting their homes between 2001 and 2011 , the number of households buying their homes through a mortgage fell by 749,000			0
the @entity16 said high house prices , low wage growth and tighter rules imposed by lenders were to blame			1
among the 8.3 million renters in 2011 , those renting from private landlords or letting agents were up 1.7 million to 3.6 million compared to 2001 , while those socially renting decreased by about 100 , 000 to 4.1 million			0
all regions in @entity75 and @entity76 had increases in private renters , of which 343,000 were in @entity44 , 233,000 in the @entity79 and 209,000 in the @entity80			0
@entity76 and the @entity81 had the lowest increase with about 75,000 and 73,000 households respectively			0
rising house prices , lower wage growth and tighter lending rules have made it harder to get on the property ladder the @entity16 said : ‘ the rapid increase in the number of households privately renting could be linked to the decline in the number of households getting on the housing ladder , usually through a mortgage			1
‘ this is mainly because of the increasing difficulty for first time buyers to raise deposits for a mortgage			2
’ between 2001 and 2011 the average house price for first time buyers soared by an eye - watering 96 per cent , putting the dream of home ownership out of reach for millions			1
the problem was compounded by mortgage firms tightening rules on who they would lend to in the wake of the 2007 financial crash , as the era of near 100 per cent mortgages became a thing of the past			2
in 2001 the average house was six times average wages but a decade later it was nine times larger , forcing people to wait longer to save bigger deposits			0
@entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 had the highest level proportion of homes bought with a mortgage , while in @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 almost half of properties are owned outright			0
almost half of homes in @entity127 are owned outright without a mortgage , a breakdown by the @entity16 revealed			1

high house prices , low wage growth and a lack of mortgages blamed
