a 15 - year - old prisoner accused of having fought for @entity1 has described how the terrorists murder women who show their skin and drug young men to convince them to carry out suicide attacks			1
a group of accused men are being held in northern @entity10 after being captured earlier this year by @entity12 troops battling to force the jihadists out of the area			1
while many of the prisoners deny being involved , teenager @entity15 readily admits his links to @entity1 - claiming he had been threatened with beheading if they did not join the terror group			1
@entity15 was eventually captured by @entity12 fighters in june , during a firefight in which he was shot three times in the stomach , leaving massive scars			1
among those interviewed was 15 - year - old @entity15 , who openly tells of having fought for @entity1 - something none of the other men in the jail admit to			1
his face was covered throughout the interview , presumably so @entity1 fighters would n't recognise him			2
but rather than joining the group voluntarily , @entity15 says the militants entered his village and gave all the men there the option of joining their campaign of terror or face being beheaded			2
in order to ensure their largely reluctant recruits give their all in battle , @entity1 makes them take the anti-anxiety drug @entity33 to make the fighters ' willing suicide bombers , @entity15 claimed			1
' that drug makes you lose your mind ... if they give you a suicide belt and tell you to blow yourself up , you 'll do it , ' he said			0
accused : a group of accused men are being held in northern @entity10 after being captured earlier this year by @entity12 troops battling to force the jihadists out of the area injury : 15 - year - old @entity15 revealed three large wounds on his stomach which he claims were received while fighting the @entity12 troops who would eventually take him captive describing the horrors of his time in @entity1 ' ranks , @entity15 says : ' i even saw them kill a woman because her wedding dress showed her neck and bare arms			1
' he also revealed three large wounds on his stomach which he claims were received while fighting the @entity12 troops who would eventually take him captive			1
@entity15 's story is a long way from the myth @entity1 likes to propagate , that its followers are pious men and women drawn to the group 's hardline interpretation of @entity100			1
the reality in many cases is that @entity1 ' reputation for bloody violence is the only thing encouraging new recruits from within the many towns and villages the terror group has seized in recent months			2
this morning a terror expert described how @entity1 grooms @entity112 fighters in much the same way as paedophiles do with children			0
fear : the men accused of being @entity38 fighters were interviewed in the basement of their prison in northern @entity10 by @entity48 ( left ) , a correspondent for @entity49 @entity121 is accused of plotting to detonate a car bomb on behalf of the @entity38 terror group militant : @entity1 grooms new recruits online in much the same way as paedophiles do with children professor @entity127 , from @entity130 's @entity129 's @entity128 , told @entity131 that recruiters lure targets by making friends through social media , like many sexual predators			1
' somebody might strike up a friendship in an online chat forum and present themselves in a different fashion - to try to get them into their web ... by the time they actually meet the people they 're speaking with , they may be in too deep to know better			0
' while that approach may work with naive @entity112 recruits , the reality is that for many of those already living under @entity1 ' bloody oppression , it is only the fear that the group 's leadership will murder either them or their loved ones , that encourages militants to take up arms for the @entity38			1
@entity38 militants fighting in @entity10 and @entity164 have released a sickening video of a young woman being stoned to death by a group of men - including her own father			2
the shocking footage is understood to have been filmed in the city of @entity173 and shows a bearded cleric ranting at the woman in @entity176 and accusing her adultery while she pleads for her life			0
the woman turns to her father and begs his forgiveness but he coldly rejects her , saying he would rather please @entity182			0
he then turns to the men to give the signal for his daughter 's murder to begin			0
@entity187 : the bearded @entity1 militant orders the woman to be ' content and happy ' that she is about to be stoned to death because , he says , her death has been ordered by @entity182			2
her father ( left ) stands next to the extremist minutes later , as the men rain rocks down upon the helpless woman , her father steps forward with a large stone and the video fades to black			0
it is believed he had been granted the barbaric ' honour ' of being allowed end the life of the daughter he felt had betrayed both him and her religion			0
the sickening five - minute video emerged on @entity1 - affiliated social media pages this morning			0
it is not clear when the footage was actually shot and has not been independently verified			0
the exact accusations against the woman remain sketchy , although the cleric who appears at the start of mobile phone - filmed clip accuses her of committing adultery			0
shocking : as the militants rain down rocks on the defenseless woman , her father ( left ) steps forward and picks up the largest rock before using it to strike and kill his daughter			0
