by @entity0 if there was a @entity2 for thighs @entity3 would already be beyond the last - 16 as the @entity6 hat - trick hero reaps the rewards for intensive rehabilitation work on his troublesome leg muscles			1
his huge thighs even rival those of cycling legend @entity13 - whose upper legs each measure 27 inches in circumference			0
@entity3 has hit top form at the right time for @entity19 , scoring the tournament 's second hat - trick as they beat @entity22 3 - 0 in their final group game to set up tuesday 's date with @entity25			1
but it 's been anything but a smooth build - up for the @entity30 midfielder , who suffered no less than three thigh tears last season			0
@entity19 are undoubted underdogs going into monday 's meeting with @entity25 at @entity66			0
@entity67 has been in imperious form in the blue and white , but his dominance - the @entity72 star has scored four of his side 's six goals - may be viewed as somewhat of a weakness			2
the @entity6 , despite @entity3 's hat - trick , have five goalscorers in the tourament so far .			2

the @entity6 face @entity67 's @entity25 on tuesday in the last 16
@entity62 's side *qualified* after finishing second in @entity53
@entity3 has suffered three thigh muscle injuries in the past season
he scored the second hat - trick of the tournament against @entity22
