@entity0 believes @entity1 are ready for ' one more big push ' in the on sunday in @entity3 when they face fierce rivals @entity6 in the @entity8 final			1
the fast bowler said his team had allowed itself a day to celebrate the dramatic semi-final win over @entity12 at @entity13 in @entity14 , and had now ' parked ' the memory of that match			1
playing in a @entity8 final , particularly against @entity6 in front of almost 100,000 spectators at the @entity20 , was his ' dream come true			1
' @entity0 is relishing the prospect of facing @entity6 in the @entity8 final on sunday @entity1 practiced at the @entity20 on friday in preparation for the final @entity25 will play his last ever odi for @entity1 on sunday in the @entity8 final ' as a kid growing up you either wanted to be an @entity29 or a @entity1 and this is as good as it gets , ' he said			1
' i 'm sure the guys are very excited to fulfill a childhood dream			2
' @entity0 said @entity1 captain @entity35 ' speaks a lot about it being the time of our lives and the last couple of months we would n't replace for anything			2
we never wanted it to end , we 've made it last as long as we possibly cane and one more big push and the guys will remember it forever			0
' @entity0 spoke of a sporting rivalry with @entity6 in which @entity1 was always ' the little brother			1
' he was asked directly at a news conference on friday whether sunday 's final was about winning the respect of a fierce sporting rival whose attitude to @entity1 cricket has always contained a note of condescension			2
@entity1 batsman @entity59 practices his football skills during the training session in @entity3 @entity1 captain @entity35 in the nets just outside the @entity20 @entity63 has a throw at the stumps in a fielding drill during @entity1 's practice session @entity0 allowed that there had been cause in the past for @entity6 to view @entity1 in that manner			1
' in times gone by we have n't played to our potential or been as consistent as we should have been , ' he said			0
' in the last two years we 've slowly , slowly gained a bit more respect because of the brand of cricket we 're playing			0
' we respect @entity6 , they 're a quality side and they 're not no 1 in the world for no reason			2
but i 'm sure we 've gained a bit of repsect for the brand of cricket we 've played over the last couple of years			0
i guess that opinion has changed a little bit over the last couple of years in the way that we 've played and because of the sides we 've beaten			0
' @entity0 said a @entity8 final between the tournament 's co-hosts at the @entity20 - one of cricket 's greatest stages - was ' pretty exciting			1
' ' it 's an awesome opportunity , ' he said			0
' it 's going to be a great game of cricket			0
obviously both teams are playing exceptionally well at the moment and both are playing a great brand of cricket so it should be an exciting game and a great game to watch			0
' @entity1 captain @entity35 and fast bowler @entity109 share a joke during their practice session @entity1 's lethal opening duo of @entity115 ( left ) and @entity0 ( right ) practice in @entity3 the 100,000 capacity @entity20 will provide a fitting venue for sunday 's showpiece the first appearance of gamesmanship in the leadup to the match came early , when former @entity6 batsman @entity123 said @entity1 might be at a loss in the giant auditorium of the @entity20 , because it is so much larger than the venues in which they typically play at home			1
' @entity1 has n't played @entity6 at the @entity20 in almost six years but @entity0 doubted they would struggle to adapt to the dimensions			1
' we 're not too worried about the size of the ground , ' @entity0 said			2
' yeah , we have n't played here for a long time but there are half a dozen guys who were part of the last game that we played here and we have good memories of that game			0
it 's a big cricket ground , there 's going to be a lot of people , it 's going to be loud , but at the end of the day it 's another game of cricket			0
