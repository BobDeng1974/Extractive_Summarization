as the most fouled player in the @entity2 , you might expect @entity3 to be bored of having his legs taken away from under him			1

i have been used to taking the knocks			1
the more i take , the happier i am			2
' it always makes me want to outdo them but in a football way and i do n’t want to make their life a misery by kicking them			2
i want to hurt the opponent but in terms of the football			2
the one @entity42 did respond , it was a ball - boy on the receiving end , with the 24 - year - old dismissed in controversial fashion			2
the 24 - year - old has only had one red card in his @entity17 career , when kicked a ball boy against @entity51 hazard controls the ball in training ahead of the @entity56 final against @entity57 on sunday ' that [ @entity51 red card ] was the only one , ' he added			1

' hazard has been in scintaliting form this season , overcoming the knocks to score 13 goals already this season , and create plenty more , something he attributes to manager @entity73 's guidance			1
' it ’s true we do have a special relationship , ' continued @entity3 , who will hope to inspire @entity17 to success at @entity78 on sunday in the capital one cup final			1
