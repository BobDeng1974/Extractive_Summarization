by @entity0 published : 07:44 est , 14 november 2012 updated : 07:45 est , 14 november 2012 the @entity1 will tomorrow make their announcement on the action they will take over @entity5 race - row allegations — @entity6 understands they are unlikely to charge the referee			1
@entity1 officials have spent a significant sum on legal advice and taken their time in order to come to the right decision			1
the announcement will come 18 days after @entity5 was accused of calling @entity16 midfielder @entity15 a ‘ monkey ’			1
@entity18 : referee @entity5 ( centre ) in an exchange with @entity15 ( right ) as @entity21 looks on during the home league match against @entity23			0
the official has been accused of racially abusing @entity15 the police yesterday shelved their race abuse investigation into referee @entity5 after receiving no complaint from @entity16			1
the @entity28 have confirmed they are no longer investigating a complaint , made by the @entity30 , regarding @entity32 ’s conduct			0
the @entity1 inquiry finished on friday and they have since been receiving legal opinion on a draft document			1
it has been delayed due to the vast amount of paperwork involved			0
@entity16 submitted 1,250 pages of evidence delivered by bike courier to the @entity1 ’s three - man compliance unit when @entity43 was accused of racially abusing @entity44 — a charge he was later found guilty of by the @entity1			1
poster boys : united fans poke fun at the famous @entity16 banner , which reads ' @entity43 , captain , leader , legend ' , during the @entity55 tie they have a full - time @entity56 amongst their employees and it is believed the club will have been equally as thorough with this case			1
if , as expected , @entity32 , 37 , is cleared by the @entity1 it will leave @entity16 's reputation in tatters after their captain @entity43 was banned for four matches and fined £ 220,000 after being found guilty of racially abusing @entity65 's @entity44 by a @entity1 independent regulatory commission			1
hours after reporting @entity32 to the @entity1 , a spectator in the @entity16 end was pictured directing a ' monkey ' gesture at @entity23 striker @entity71 during a @entity55 tie			1
@entity73 , 28 , is on police bail pending a further investigation following his arrest on suspicion of a racially aggravated @entity78 offence			0
@entity16 have banned him from @entity79 until the police investigation is concluded and he faces a life - ban if found guilty			2
whistleblower : @entity16 have stood by their allegation that @entity32 ( right ) used inappropriate language in an exchange with @entity15 mr @entity73 is due back in police custody on november 29 where he will either be charged and will go to court , re-bailed pending further investigation or released without charge			1
@entity5 has not officiated in a match since the incident			0
but some refereeing experts have suggested he will be handed a last - minute match in the lower leagues this weekend in an under - the - radar bid to assimilate the @entity97 official back into officiating			0
@entity16 chairman : @entity100 the incident occurred in @entity16 ’s 3 - 2 @entity103 loss to @entity23 on october 28			2
@entity16 came from two goals behind to level at 2 - 2 before having @entity106 and @entity107 sent off			2
afterwards @entity16 accused @entity5 of the racial slur on @entity15 – who angrily stormed into his dressing room and confronted him after the match – and of calling @entity21 a ‘ @entity113 t * * * ’			2
the club later dropped the accusation against @entity21 but pressed ahead and reported the comment about @entity15 to the @entity1			2
yesterday , in an interview with the @entity118 , @entity16 chairman @entity100 stood by the club 's allegation levelled at @entity32			1
' we were guided by obligations that are imposed by the @entity1 and also as an employer			0
@entity1 rule @entity124 basically says a participant shall immediately report to the association any incident or matter which may be considered to be a misconduct			0
' misconduct is a defined term under the @entity1 regulations and includes such racial behaviour			0
we also had to consider the @entity135 , which imposes an obligation on an employer to take certain actions if an employee is subject to discrimination by third parties			0
' suppose we had tried to sweep this under the rug and said to the various players , " look , it 's not a big deal and the press are going to be all over us , maybe you want to reconsider "			0
if that had leaked out , we would 've really been crucified			0

delay due to *lawyers* *pouring* over draft document
@entity1 spend significant sum on legal advice
@entity16 stand by ' monkey ' allegations
@entity161 's reputation to be left in tatters
