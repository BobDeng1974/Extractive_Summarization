by @entity0 published : 00:42 est , 14 november 2013 updated : 04:06 est , 14 november 2013 code breaker : @entity2 , who has died aged 92 , was the last survivor of the @entity4 ' break in ' experts one of the leading female codebreakers at @entity4 who helped to crack the @entity8 ' enigma code died on @entity9 at the age of 92			1
@entity2 was the last surviving of @entity13 's ' break in ' experts - codebreakers who worked to crack new ciphers that had never been broken before			1
her achievements included cracking the @entity19 's @entity18 , leading to an emphatic @entity21 victory at @entity22 , the @entity24 's first fleet action since @entity25			1
and she crucially found a way into the enigma code used by the @entity29 secret service , a break which enabled the @entity32 deception that ensured the success of the d - day landings			1
@entity35 was born on may 5 , 1921 , in @entity36 , @entity37			0
she was studying @entity29 at @entity38 , @entity37 , when the war broke out			0
she patriotically decided to break off her studies and enlist as a nurse to help the war effort , but was told that she would be more use to @entity21 as a @entity29 linguist			0
initially she hoped to be a @entity46 spy , adventuring into occupied @entity47 to seduce @entity29 officers			0
' i do n't think either my legs or my @entity29 were good enough because they sent me to the @entity51 , ' she was quoted as saying by @entity52			0
after showing promise during a short stint working in @entity37 , checking the personal columns in the papers for coded message , she was sent to @entity13 to work on with @entity58 , whose research unit led the way in breaking @entity18			1
after his initial success with @entity18 , @entity58 , a classic @entity21 eccentric , was working on new and as yet uncracked variants			1
nineteen - year - old @entity2 was thrust straight in at the deep end , working on the updated @entity66 naval enigma machine			1
after months of hard work , in late march 1941 , she had a breakthrough			0
she deciphered a message outlining a large - scale @entity66 assault on a @entity24 convoy carrying supplies from @entity73 to @entity74 , which contained the full details of the plan of attack			1
' how many cruisers there were , and how many submarines were to be there and where they were to be at such and such a time , absolutely incredible that they should spell it all out , ' she recalled			0
the message was passed on via the @entity24 's top brass to admiral @entity86 , commander of the @entity24 's @entity87 , giving him the intelligence he needed to pull a fast one on the @entity66			1
he tricked the @entity90 consul in @entity91 , who was passing on information on the fleet 's movements to the @entity29 , into thinking he was having the weekend off to play golf			0
then , under cover of darkness , and with detailed information of the @entity66 navy 's positions , he took the battle to them with a massive fleet action			2
over march 27 and 28 , @entity86 's forces staged a series of surprise attacks on the @entity66 , sinking three cruisers and two destroyers , actions that cost them 3,000 sailors			2
the @entity66 never again dared to sail close to @entity24 until @entity86 accepted their surrender in 1943			1
war effort : as a 19 - year - old @entity2 was thrust straight in at the deep end , working on the updated @entity66 naval enigma machine			1
after months of hard work , in late march 1941 , she had a breakthrough but @entity2 's most crucial contribution came in collaboration with @entity58 and another of his assistants , @entity121 , with the cracking of the enigma code used by the @entity124 , the @entity29 secret service			1
@entity21 's own spies had been able to capture most of the agents sent to the @entity21 , and those in the neutral capitals of @entity130 and @entity131 , and were using them to feed back false information to @entity29			0
but no - one knew whether this so - called @entity32 was working , whether @entity29 's commanders had been convinced by the fake intelligence sent back			0
the @entity136 was far more complex than the standard version , with its machines using four rotors , rather than the usual three , which rotated randomly with no predictable pattern			2
@entity2 worked with @entity58 and @entity142 to test out every possibility and , on december 8 , 1941 , she broke a message on the link between @entity146 and @entity147 , making it possible to reconstruct one of the rotors			1
that was the clue they needed and , within days , @entity58 's team had broken the @entity136			2
shortly afterwards , @entity2 cracked a second @entity124 cipher , allowing the agents to finally confirm that the @entity29 believed the phoney intelligence coming from the @entity32 operation			2
love : @entity2 pictured with her husband @entity158 , also a @entity4 code breaker , in 1942 now the time was right for one of the war 's most audacious tricks			2
@entity21 agents fed a stream of messages to @entity29 commanders informing them that a @entity169 group was forming in @entity170 and @entity171			0
as a result , @entity172 believed that @entity175 's main invasion force was to land on the @entity176 rather than @entity177 , leading him to hold two key armoured divisions in that area			2
field marshal @entity181 's head of intelligence , brigadier @entity180 , later said that without that key deception , the @entity177 invasion may well have been a disaster			0
war effort : @entity4 , @entity187 , where code breakers worked throughout the @entity189 @entity2 met her husband , @entity190 , himself a codebreaker while working at @entity4			1
after the war she spent some time with the diplomatic service , and then brought up three two daughters and a son			0
she has published a number of books on garden history , as well as some relating to @entity4 , and has served as president of the @entity200 , of which she became the secretary in 1971			0
she was awarded the @entity203 in 1985 , and made a @entity204 ( @entity204 ) in 1987 , in both cases for her work on preservation and conservation of gardens .			0

@entity2 worked throughout the war on cracking @entity18 codes
her work on the @entity66 @entity18 led to emphatic @entity24 victory
her cracking of the @entity136 ensured success of @entity177 landings
