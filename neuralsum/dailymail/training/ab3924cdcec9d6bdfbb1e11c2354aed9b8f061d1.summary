‘ you 've got to be on your toes at all times and i have to say i think we have been			0
‘ we 've had ( speculation ) in the past			0
some of it carries weight - there were a lot of rumours last season with @entity7 and @entity30 and it happened so i 'm always open minded about it			2
scarred : past experience has meant @entity3 is making sure that he has alternative options deadline decisions : both @entity7 and @entity6 left @entity9 right at the end of a transfer window ‘ i 'm as confident as i can be with any player that he will stay			1
’ @entity4 – at 28 years old – is believed to want a big - money move and @entity60 have also been linked with the @entity62 international			1

we are really , really pleased with him			0
’ meanwhile , @entity106 left - back @entity104 has been ruled out for three months with a knee injury			1
