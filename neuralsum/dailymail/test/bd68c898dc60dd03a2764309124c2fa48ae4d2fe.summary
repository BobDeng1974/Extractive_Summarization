there were 72 unprovoked shark attacks around the world last year , with three people killed in @entity4 and @entity5			1
according to the @entity8 , which gathers statistics on interactions between the mammals and humans , the number of worldwide unprovoked shark attacks has grown at a steady pace since 1900 , with each decade having more attacks than the previous			1
however , despite the worrying statistics , only a minority of sharks are any danger to humans , with @entity19 , @entity20 and tiger sharks accounting for the vast majority of attacks			1
the young teen was reported to be surfing in an area deemed out of bounds by officials due to the high risk of sharks			1
reunion has recorded seven fatal shark attacks in the past five years , more per capita than anywhere else in the world			1
the @entity8 reports that there were 52 shark attacks in @entity50 waters in 2014 , compared to 29 in 2015			1
@entity4 's 11 attacks was lower than its 12.5 attacks per year average over the past ten years ( 2004 - 2013 ) and the two fatalities were in line with its 1.5 yearly average over the same time period			1
so are there any simple precautions that can be taken to avoid a shark attack ? and what should you do if you come into contact with one ? bright swim gear which contrasts strongly with skin colour can attracts sharks do n't look like a fish even if you think you 're in a safe area of water , a rogue shark attack can never be ruled out			1
experts warn swimmers not to wear any jewellery or items that reflect the light			1
as far as sharks are concerned , that flash of light could easily be the sun reflecting off fish scales			1
this is particularly important if swimming in choppy and unclear conditions which can make it harder for a shark to distinguish between swimmers and prey			1
even brightly coloured clothing can cause trouble , as sharks see in black and white and use contrast to distinguish colour , meaning they will pick up the difference between skin and a bright swimsuit			1
the same can be said for sunburn , causing colour differentiation on skin			0
equally , surfers can easily be confused for seals			0
lounging on a surfboard in a wetsuit can give the outline of a seal from a shark 's point of view			1
while this is hard to avoid , try surfing in a group and stay alert to your surroundings at all times			2
going on a cage dive is the best and safest way of encountering a shark use your common sense it may sound ridiculously obvious , but when people want to experience the ultimate experience on the waves , common sense goes out the window			2
put simply , do n't swim with shark food			2
where there are fish , there could be sharks and sharks eat fish			2
by swimming or surfing near fishing boats or areas with sea birds feeding , you 're at increased risk of encountering a shark			2
@entity135 , director of the @entity136 , told @entity137 : ' it really comes down to common sense			0
we do a pretty good job here in the @entity50 as last year there were no fatalities from shark attacks			1
' what we need to do is avoid where sharks are at present			2
' try to avoid swimming or surfing near the exits of sewage pipes , the waste released will attract fish , which in turn will attract their predators			0
it can seem a good idea to take a romantic swim at sunset , but it is actually harder for sharks to spot the difference between humans and prey in darker conditions swim in good weather - and during the day it is easy to think that evening swim from the beach is a romantic way to enjoy your surroundings undisturbed , but dark conditions make it hard for sharks to distinguish swimmers form their prey			1
the same can be said for murky water and foggy weather			2
these conditions impair a shark 's vision and also a swimmer 's making it harder for them to observe their surroundings and stay safe			1
always swim in a group			0
@entity189 most often attack lone individuals			0
do n't wander too far from shore			0
doing so isolates you and places you away from assistance			0
avoid the water at night , dawn , or dusk			2
many sharks are most active at these times and are better able to find you than you are to see them			2
do n't enter the water if bleeding			2
@entity189 can smell and taste blood , and trace it back to its source			0
do n't wear shiny jewellery			2
the reflected light looks like shining fish scales			0
and what to do if you come into contact with a shark ... if attacked by a shark , the general rule is ' do whatever it takes to get away ! ' some people have successfully chosen to be aggressive , others passive			2
some yelled underwater , others blew bubbles			0
source : @entity218 know where is safe to swim in countries where shark attacks are frequent , officials should clearly mark areas that are deemed ' safe to swim / surf ' and those that are not			1
always pay heed to local knowledge , particularly on beaches in the @entity50 , @entity4 and @entity5 , where the majority of attacks happened in 2014			2
keep in mind that single attacks also happened in @entity35 , @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity237 , and the @entity238			2
when swimming in open water , avoid areas such as sand shelves and areas between sand bars , where the ground drops away into much deeper water , sharks often frequent these areas			1
likewise , channels and river mouths are other areas than can be rich with food for sharks , just like sewage waste pipes , so stay away			1
it is important for swimmers and surfers to be clued on where is safe to take to the water ( file photo ) swim in groups swim and surf with friends			0
it 's common sense for in case something goes wrong there is someone there to help , but also sharks are n't as likely to attack a group			0
to this end , in the unfortunate situation where you come face to face with a shark ( see below ) , the group can work together to enact defensive situations			0
going back to back with other divers mean you can keep your eyes on the challenge from all directions and prepare to fight			0
use a shark repellent if you are a regular surfer , meaning you 're often in open water in low light and sometimes alone , it can pay off to use a shark repellent			1
locals in @entity292 are increasingly placing their trust in technologies that claim to keep the predators away by sending an electric pulse through the water			0
one particular device , known as the @entity299 ( @entity299 ) , has enjoyed massive popularity on the islands			0
users strap the devices to their ankles , wetsuits or surfboards			0
some are about the size of an oversized watch , others the size of a wallet			0
they range in price from £ 249 ( $ 399 ) to £ 390 ( $ 649 )			0
researcher @entity314 told @entity316 news the pulse is an effective way to stopping a shark in its tracks			0
she said : ' as the shark swims toward it , it 's like punching them in the face with a cattle prod			0
' it is important to swim in groups or with one other person to help look out for threats and also put off sharks from attacking a shark begins to circle , what should you do ? there are lots of myths around what you should you if you are unlucky enough to come into contact with a shark			1
sharks are said to bite out of simple curiosity ; they are known to bite anything that bobs on water just to see what it tastes like			1
@entity350 rubbish two of the suggested things you should do to ward off an attack ; splashing violently and playing dead are no - nos. splashing violently will only go to attract more sharks towards you , while playing dead leads to resulting in just that - a limp body will simply encourage the shark to tuck in			1
instead you should try and attack its soft spots , those being the eyes and gills			0
@entity135 from the @entity8 said : ' i advise to be as aggressively defensive as you are able			0
' playing dead ' does not work			0
pound the shark in any way possible			0
try to claw at the eyes and gill openings , two very sensitive areas			0
' there were only three fatalities record from unprovoked shark attacks in 2014 , two in @entity4 and one in @entity5			1
the @entity8 investigated 130 incidents of alleged shark - human interaction occurring worldwide in 2014			1
upon review , 72 of these incidents represented confirmed cases of unprovoked shark attacks on humans			1
of the 72 incidents of unprovoked shark attacks around the world last year , there were three fatalities the 58 incidents not accorded unprovoked status in 2014 included 33 provoked attacks , nine interactions involving a shark biting a motorized or non-motorized vessel ( ' boat attack ' ) , four incidents regarded as not involving a shark ( ' doubtful ' ) , one case involving sinking ships or downed aircraft ( ' air - sea disaster ' ) , two incidents involving post-mortem bites ( ' scavenge ' ) , and nine cases in which data is unavailable to determine if an unprovoked shark attack occurred ( ' insufficient evidence ' )			1
the 2014 yearly total of 72 unprovoked attacks was lower than the 75 recorded in 2013 and represents the lowest global total since 68 in 2009			0
however , the number of worldwide unprovoked shark attacks has grown at a steady pace since 1900 , with each decade having more attacks than the previous information collected from the @entity413 ( @entity414 ) .			1

*adhere* to beach rules and stay out of shark - *infested* waters
however , not wearing jewellery in the water might not be considered
tragic death of 13 - year - old surfer @entity33 sees the threat of sharks once again in the spotlight
shark attacks continue to rise over the course of the *century*
