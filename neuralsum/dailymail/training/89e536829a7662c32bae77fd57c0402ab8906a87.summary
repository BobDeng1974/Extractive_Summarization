there are few things to make someone feel worse than being caught out after lying to a loved one			0
for one man in @entity6 , that feeling seems to have got too much , leading him to take desperate measures to apologise to his girlfriend			1
these pictures show the mystery man standing on a city centre junction in @entity6 wearing a sandwich board bearing the words , ' i 'm so sorry i lied '			1
eventually a woman appeared , presumably the man 's girlfriend , and she spoke to him for around half an hour more			1
they both then walked off together to a nearby block of flats and appeared to have got over whatever it was that had come between them			2
whether the man , who appeared to be in his mid- 30s , was standing there for a dare , or whether the move was his idea to win her back or prompted by her is unknown			2
@entity41 , 33 , spotted the man near @entity18 from a nearby office window on thursday evening and took the photographs			2
he said : ' he was there for quite a while , i spotted him at about 8pm			0
the man wore only shorts and a t - shirt as he waited for the woman to appear , but mystery remains over what he had done to warrant giving such a humiliating apology ' then the girl came down			1
i do n’t know if he knew she would be passing and was waiting for her or if he had been sent out there by her with the sign around his neck			0
' mr @entity41 , a director at a computer graphics firm , said : ' they talked for a long time out there on the junction			0
' i assume he was off the hook by the end of it because they were all smiles as they walked off to one of the flats			0
' i do n’t have a clue what he did but it must have been pretty bad			0
i ’ve never seen anything like it ! ' do you know who the mystery man or woman are ? email @entity79			1
