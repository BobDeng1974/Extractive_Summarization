by @entity0 published : 17:30 est , 2 august 2013 updated : 19:12 est , 2 august 2013 two special dogs who were abandoned as pups formed a close friendship when they were both rescued by a dog shelter , and now the two have been adopted out together to a new ' forever home '			1
eve , a @entity10 mix , was found by a @entity12 mail carrier as a nine - week - old puppy nearly frozen in a snow drift on @entity8			2
@entity15 is a two - year - old @entity17 cross who was dropped off at a dog boarding kennel - and never picked up again			1
best friends : eve ( left ) and her partner in crime @entity15 ( right ) complementary : @entity25 ca n't see and @entity15 ca n't hear , but together they 're unbeatable pound puppies : eve and @entity15 became inseparable when they met at @entity31 's @entity30 eve is deaf and missing one eye ; @entity15 is completely blind			1
staff at the @entity31 's @entity30 , where the two both ended up , were worried their disabilities would mean they would n't be able to socialize together , but were amazed when the opposite happened			2
' i thought their disabilities would separate them , but from the beginning they just clicked , ' @entity41 told @entity44 23			2
the pair became inseparable , and their abilities served to help each other , rather than their disabilities hampering them			0
according to @entity50 , @entity25 's disabilities made it difficult for her to interact with other dogs , and she was constantly chasing shadows due to her inhibited senses			2
overjoyed : @entity31 's @entity30 staff were delighted the two dogs were going to be adopted together ' @entity15 are the perfect compliment [ sic ] for one another , and essentially watch / lookout for each other			1
. each has never been more at ease than when they are together			0
we walk off leash and she leads him			0
his acute hearing helps her feel more comfortable about her inability to hear			0
@entity71 they are ! ' says the @entity31 's @entity72			0
the staff at @entity31 's @entity30 were hoping against hope that the pair would be adopted together , but they were not optimistic that they would find anyone willing to take on not one but two large , disabled dogs			1
settling in : eve and @entity15 are getting used to their new home together @entity25 had returned to @entity31 's @entity30 shelter after an unsuccessful adoption due to the extra problems that arise from her disabilities , while @entity15 arrived at the shelter last month			1
@entity31 's @entity30 is active on @entity87 and other social media and posted about the two dogs ' plights , getting their network of ' @entity92 ' to help			0
@entity93 happened to see the posts and found herself unable to stop thinking about @entity8			0
' a co-worker of mine showed me a picture of @entity8 and by the fourth day i said " ok , i 've got to meet this dog			0
" ' smiles : these two disabled dogs are happier than they 've ever been since they met each other home wanted : some of @entity8 and @entity15 's friends still needing a home when she arrived to meet @entity8 , she quickly discovered she came in a pair , but with four dogs , a fiance , an 11 - year - old and a new home , @entity93 was unsure if she could handle two more dogs			1
after witnessing the special relationship between the two dogs , though , she could n't say no. ' the home they are in is quite honestly perfect , and the two even have an 11 - year - old human that they have added to their gang ! ' @entity41 told @entity50			1
the pair , who look remarkably similar , faced a grim future had they not been adopted .			0

two white dogs , one blind , one deaf , formed a special bond at a dog shelter
eve and @entity15 complement each other perfectly with their disabilities
staff were n't optimistic the two large , disabled dogs would be adopted , and even less hopeful they *'d* be taken together
eve and @entity15 have been adopted into a new home in @entity140
