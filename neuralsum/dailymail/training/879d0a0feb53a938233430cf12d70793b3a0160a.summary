by @entity0 @entity2 families are paying hundreds of pounds more for the latest technology as global electronics giants see the @entity2 as a ‘ @entity5 ’			0
the biggest difference was found a top of the range @entity9 , which was £ 755 more expensive including sales tax here versus the @entity12 , according to research by which ? its research comparing prices in this country to the @entity12 found the huge mark - ups stretch to big brand tablets , laptops and even software and music streaming services			1
the biggest difference was a top of the range @entity9 , which was £ 755 more expensive for example , an @entity26 13 - inch laptop was £ 355 more expensive here , while the @entity30 and @entity31 games consoles were £ 95 more			1
successive governments have complained how global firms , from fashion and beauty brands to car manufacturers , consistently charge @entity2 consumers more on the basis they can get away with it			0
the business secretary , @entity40 , campaigned on the issue when the @entity42 were in @entity43 , but he has done nothing to overcome the rip - offs since joining the government			2
an @entity26 13 - inch laptop was £ 355 more expensive here while the @entity30 and @entity31 games consoles were £ 95 more the which ? survey found @entity52 is also taking advantage of @entity2 consumers with the price of its @entity58 8.9in @entity57 tablet and @entity59 some £ 88 more expensive than the @entity12			1
the @entity61 tablet works out at £ 54 more			2
the @entity63 satnav is £ 66 more expensive here and the @entity66 headphones are £ 72 more at £ 250 , including tax			1
consumers in @entity2 are effectively blocked from buying these goods more cheaply over the web and getting them posted to the @entity2 because of various hurdles erected by the government and the firms			0
postal costs can be high , while there are also import duties on electronics products bought through websites based in the @entity12 , which will reduce the value of any saving			1
the current threshold before import duty is imposed on goods bought online is £ 135 , which is much lower than £ 390 figure if the same consumer buys the goods themselves while abroad			2
the which ? survey found @entity52 is also taking advantage of @entity2 consumers global companies will make product specifications slightly different in the @entity12 versus the @entity2 , which creates doubt and confusion as to whether a product will connect to the web or mobile network here			1
they will also sometimes refuse to honour warranties on items bought overseas			0
which ? also found enormous mark - ups on software and digital services offered by global brands			1
for example , the @entity109 imaging software is £ 208 more for a 12 month subscription at £ 563 in this country			1
a 12 month subscription to @entity114 , which covers delivery and online streaming of films , music and tv programmes , works out at £ 80 in the @entity2 , which is £ 21 more			1
when in opposition , the @entity42 business secretary , @entity40 , lambasted the last government for failing to put an end to rip - off @entity2 similarly , the music streaming service @entity125 charges @entity2 customers £ 120 a year , which compares to £ 71 in @entity128			1
@entity129 and @entity130 also punish consumers here with higher bills			0
part of the price difference can be explained by the fact the @entity2 has a very high vat rate of 20per cent			2
by comparison , the figure in @entity128 is 8.41per cent on physical goods and zero on digital services or products			2
even when tax is excluded from the equation the @entity145 , which is a @entity147 65inch tv with internet access and a curved led screen , was £ 402 more expensive to @entity2 families when the survey was conducted			1
which ? wants manufacturers to play fair and explain why tech products in the @entity2 are more expensive in comparison to the @entity12			1
it is also calling on the government to raise the current threshold for import duty on goods bought online to the same threshold as that placed on goods brought back from abroad , so shoppers can take advantage of cheaper goods on sale in the @entity12			1
which ? executive director , @entity168 , said : ‘ @entity2 consumers are getting a raw deal by paying up to hundreds of pounds more for the same tech products on sale in the @entity12			2
manufacturers should play fair and explain why consumers are paying more for buying in the @entity2			0
’ companies like @entity52 claim the higher prices in this country are the results of the higher costs of doing business here , in terms of staff and business taxes and rates			0
however , the @entity12 company has come under fire for the fact that it has gone to extraordinary lengths to avoid paying its fair share of taxes , despite sales of more than £ 4.5billion a year in @entity2			1
the firm has also faced protests over its failure to pay a living wage to employees here			0
the firm has defended its higher prices , saying ‘ operating costs differ by country , but as with all products on @entity52 , we work hard to offer customers the lowest possible prices			0
‘ there are different , and higher , taxes in @entity206 , as well as higher transport and other operating costs but we are always working to try and lower them			0
’ when in opposition , the @entity211 - dem business secretary , @entity40 , lambasted the last government for failing to put an end to rip - off @entity2			2
he pointed out : ‘ the value of the web is that we can now find out what is going on			0
it is easier than in the past to know that we are being ripped off			0
‘ the only rational explanation for price differentials is discrimination			0
’ he said the last government and @entity224 had not been active enough in protecting consumers			0
he has since scrapped the @entity224 , removing a key protection for consumers against unfair prices .			0
