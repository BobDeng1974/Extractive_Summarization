there is nothing quite as pleasing as arriving on a wet friday evening off a busy commuter train to a glowing cottage with a kitchen stocked with local treats			2
a tot of cider brandy , anyone ? we need it after that journey			0
we are staying in pretty @entity12 in @entity13 , which is cosy - with its wood - burner in an inglenook fireplace			1
the taller among us have to mind our heads			0
this is chocolate - box territory			1
shelter from the storm : @entity12 sits just outside the picturesque @entity13 village of @entity22 we plan on battening down			1
but the lovely surrounding countryside and diminutive village of @entity22 at the end of the lane ( 19th - century church , a sprinkling of houses , horse - riders and hearty walkers ) begs to be explored			1
it is hilly , with signposted walks			0
there ’s plenty to see - but a lot of it depends on the weather			1
even the sweeping @entity41 coastline ( within an hour ’s drive ) can be a little dispiriting in the winter drizzle			0
instead we opt for @entity46 , an hour ’s drive away			1
the cathedral is rightly the main attraction			2
built in the early 13th century , it is an ornate place of worship , and boasts @entity52 ’s tallest spire			0
at 414 ft , it has held the title since the 16th century			0
all very cosy : the cottage sleeps up to six people , but can also be a splendid location for a couple 's weekend oh the weather outside is frightful : @entity12 's fireside lounge makes a fine retreat from the rainiest day if you have a head for heights , you can take a tower tour and see the wood scaffolding erected in the 14th century for repair work			1
outside are views of the surrounding landscape from which @entity70 painted one of his most famous late works , @entity73			0
it ’s an attractive city to wander around , especially when the houses are decked up in their @entity79 finery			2
back at the thatched cottage , there is a ring binder full of recommendations for local pubs , but we are happy to do no more than settle in by the fire with that cider brandy			0
@entity88 ( 01963 441311 , www.premiercottages.co.uk ) has a week ’s stay in @entity12 from £ 595 for up to six people			1
a three - night short break is from £ 350 .			2

@entity12 is a *discreet* hideaway in the lovely @entity13 countryside
@entity96 enough to sleep six people , it sits close to the little village of @entity22
the *historic* city of @entity46 , with its huge cathedral , is an easy day - trip
