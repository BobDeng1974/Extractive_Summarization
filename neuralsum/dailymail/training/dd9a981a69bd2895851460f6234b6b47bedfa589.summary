the controversial badger cull has fallen so far short of its target that every animal killed has cost taxpayers more than £ 2,000 , it is claimed			1
only 708 badgers , or 30 per cent of the population , have been killed in @entity7 , falling far short of the 70 per cent target			1
and it emerged last week that only 850 animals have been killed in @entity11 – the other area where the cull pilot is being carried out – far fewer than the aim of 2,100			2
the overall costs of the two culls , including policing animal rights protesters , is estimated by campaigners at some £ 3.5million			1
@entity19 : the badger cull is costing £ 2,200 per animal killed			2
only 30 per cent of @entity7 population have been killed - falling short of the 70 per cent target with a total of 1,558 dead animals , this works out at £ 2,246 per badger			1
in contrast , vaccinating badgers against bovine tuberculosis in @entity30 was less than a third of the cost at £ 662 per animal			2

' to put that in perspective , the cost of each dead badger could provide a hospital bed for a week			0
‘ i do n’t know how they can possibly kill enough badgers in the next three weeks in either zone to reach the total they want			0
‘ that means scientifically the cull ca n’t possibly have any positive impact on bovine tb – and will most likely make it worse			0
‘ they should stop now before this cull costs more lives and more taxpayers ’ money for absolutely no reason			0
’ experts have said that at least 70 per cent of badgers in an area must be killed in order to limit bovine tb – meaning that costs could spiral further if the cull is unsuccessful			1
environment secretary @entity82 yesterday denied the project was a failure but confirmed the cull companies would be seeking an eight - week extension so they could reduce animal numbers further			0
last week , he was ridiculed for suggesting badgers had ‘ moved the goalposts ’ as he revealed the @entity91 had reduced its cull target			2
