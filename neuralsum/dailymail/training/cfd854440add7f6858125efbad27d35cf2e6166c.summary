published : 09:35 est , 12 september 2013 updated : 10:33 est , 12 september 2013 @entity0 has narrowed down the hunt for an asteroid that it can capture and put it into orbit around the moon			1
the space agency said it has found three suitable asteroids , one of which it hopes it can put into lunar orbit using a robotic space lasso			1
once in orbit , astronauts will be able to visit the space rock using the @entity14 spacecraft by as early as 2021			1
the space agency said it has identified three asteroids , one of which it hopes it can put into lunar orbit using a robotic space lasso			1
this artist 's rendering shows what capturing an asteroid could look like the asteroids are all between seven and 10m in size , but further tests will need to be conducted to determine their suitability , said scientists at a conference in @entity29 , @entity30			0
‘ we have two to three which we will characterise in the next year and if all goes well ... those will be valid candidates that could be certified targets , ’ said @entity31 , senior scientist at the @entity32			0
the mission hopes to gather useful information that will help protect the @entity39 from a potential hazardous asteroid collision , as well as the technology to enable for future human missions to deep space			1
once in orbit , astronauts will be able to visit the space rock using the @entity14 spacecraft by as early as 2021 @entity0 would find an asteroid which is between seven and 10m wide			1
they would then tow or push it towards @entity39 so that it ends up in a stable orbit near the moon			2
in 2021 astronauts would then use an @entity14 - a manned spacecraft - to land on the asteroid and bring back soil and rock samples for analysis			1
this asteroid would also , probably in the 2030s , be used as a stop - off point for astronauts on their way to @entity65			2
last month , the latest version of the plan was revealed in an animation			0
exact details on how @entity0 plans to pluck an asteroid out of its trajectory are not yet known , but the rendering shows it is captured and held inside what looks like a giant plastic bag			1
the mission involves astronauts making the journey to their captive space rock by hitching a ride on the next - generation @entity14			1
though it bares a striking resemblance to the earlier @entity81 , @entity14 can hold more crew and is far - more advanced , said @entity0			2
up to four people can be shuttled to the asteroid , compared to the maximum three in @entity81 , in a trip that utilises both solar power and the @entity88 ’s gravitational pull to power the spacecraft , according to the video			0
after the @entity14 and the asteroid are attached , the astronauts take a spacewalk to the captured object once the @entity14 docks with the remote - operated asteroid capture device , the crew performs a spacewalk that sees them climb almost the length of the conjoined vehicles to an exposed section of the asteroid they take photos of and scoop samples from , the video shows			2
after the mission is complete , @entity14 returns to @entity39 on the same path it journeyed out on , loop around the moon included , and splashes down in an ocean – likely the @entity112 – 10 days later , as seen in the video			0
the project , which envisions that astronauts could visit such an asteroid as early as 2021 , is included in president @entity118 's £ 11.5 billion spending plan for the @entity120 space agency for the 2014 tax year			1
it is intended as an expansion of existing initiatives to find asteroids that may be on a collision course with @entity39 , and as part of preparations for a human expedition to @entity65 in the 2030s			0
‘ this mission allows us to better develop our technology and systems to explore farther than we 've ever been before - to an asteroid and to mars - places that humanity has dreamed about … but has had no hope of ever attaining , ’ @entity0 administrator @entity130 said			1
using a combination of solar power and gravity - aided thrust , the @entity14 will make the 10 day trip to the asteroid ‘ we 're on the threshold of being able to tell my kids and my grandkids that we 're almost there			0
’ interest in potentially threatening asteroids sky - rocketed after a small asteroid exploded over @entity153 , @entity154 on february 15 , shattering windows and damaging buildings			0
about 1,500 people were injured by flying glass and debris			0
the same day another larger asteroid passed about 17,200 miles from @entity39 - closer than the television and communication satellites that ring the planet			2
the incidents had created an imperative ‘ to develop techniques and technology that will help deter or to keep an asteroid or other type of body from impacting @entity39 , ’ mr @entity130 said			0
‘ one of the serendipitous results from this [ asteroid - retrieval ] flight we hope will be the demonstration of a capability to move an asteroid , to deflect it ever so slightly			0
’ mr @entity118 is also requesting £ 535 million to support efforts to develop commercial space taxis in hopes of breaking @entity154 's monopoly on crew transportation to the space station by 2017 .			0

@entity0 plans to send a 7 - 10m asteroid into lunar orbit within the next decade
mission will gather data to protect the @entity39 from an asteroid collision
astronauts will be able to visit the chosen asteroid by as early as 2021
