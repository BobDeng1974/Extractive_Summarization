by @entity0 @entity2 @entity1 : took 43 minutes to die when he was executed last week last tuesday evening , a 38 - year - old man called @entity4 was led into the execution chamber at @entity7 state penitentiary			1
the sentence he was due to receive had been handed down 14 years ago , for the horrific crime of torturing , shooting and burying alive teenager @entity11			1
unsurprisingly , on the day of his death , @entity1 spent his last hours being extremely unco - operative with those who were to kill him			1
that morning , he had refused to be taken for an x-ray , and his guards were forced to stun him with a taser			2
when he finally reached the medical centre , it was found that @entity1 had earlier cut his own arm — perhaps as a way of trying to cheat his executioners by taking his own life			1
despite the condemned man ’s truculence , the grim routine of an execution continued unchecked			1
during the afternoon , @entity1 was asked what he wanted for his final meal			1
he requested a chateau - briand steak , but it was turned down because it exceeded the $ 15 budget for last meals			2
he was offered a steak from a local fast - food joint , but declined			2
in the chamber , @entity1 was asked if he had final words , to which he answered simply : ‘ no. ’ at 6.23pm , he was strapped down , covered in a white sheet , and then the process of killing him began			1
in @entity7 , executions are carried out by a series of injections , which is considered the most ‘ humane ’ method			1
under normal circumstances , a combination of three drugs is used			2
first , the prisoner is given an anaesthetic or powerful sedative			2
second , another drug paralyses the body , which is swiftly followed by a third , which stops the heart			1
this method has been used many times , and it has been shown to be grimly effective , and — reportedly in most cases — painless			2
however , last tuesday , the execution would be a little different			2
instead of using a traditional drug to sedate @entity1 , it was announced that a substitute would be used			1
as any medic will tell you , it is hard to predict how the body will react to certain combinations of drugs			2
as a result , the prison authorities were a little apprehensive , since this new ‘ protocol ’ for executing a prisoner had never been tried			2
observers were warned that the process might take a little longer than usual			2
at 6.33 , ten minutes after he was first injected , @entity1 was declared to be unconscious			1
however , three minutes later , the condemned man started to struggle violently , thrashing around and writhing against his restraints			1
he was even heard to say the word : ‘ man			1
’ alarmed , the prison authorities drew the blinds so that the observers could not see what was quickly becoming all too apparent — the execution was being botched , and @entity1 was in agony			1
in the end , it took @entity1 43 minutes to die			1
death , it was announced , was finally brought about by a ‘ massive heart attack ’			1
in @entity7 , executions are carried out by a series of injections - considered the most humane method @entity96 , the director of the @entity97 , later revealed what had gone wrong			1
‘ we ’ve had a vein failure in which the chemicals did not make it into the offender , ’ he said			2
’ although the precise details are still not clear , it appears that the authorities had to administer the sedative via a catheter into @entity1 ’s groin , after which they were finally able to inject him with the second and third drugs			1
@entity113 , @entity7 ’s governor , immediately ordered a halt to 54 planned executions , and demanded ‘ an independent review ’ into how the state executes those on @entity119			1
around the world , opinion was divided , as it always is with the death penalty			2
‘ why should we give him a humane death when he did n’t give his victim a humane death ? ’ asked one @entity7 defence lawyer			0
‘ i think that ’s a basic instinct			0
’ on the other side of the debate was the @entity133			0
a spokesman for the @entity135 declared that the execution process may have amounted to ‘ cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment ’ under international human rights law			0
also adding their voice to those who condemned the execution was a @entity144 - based organisation called @entity146 @entity145 , which campaigns worldwide for the abolition of capital punishment			0
‘ states need to stop conducting secretive , experimental executions , ’ said @entity149 , head of @entity146 ’s @entity151 team			1
ms @entity149 , a 30 - year - old former teacher , then launched an attack on companies that supplied the drugs used for executions			1
‘ it is a clear demonstration of why no responsible pharmaceutical firm or pharmacy wants to get involved in selling drugs to executioners , ’ she said			0
‘ how many more of these horrifying events will it take before the authorities in @entity7 and elsewhere get the message ? ’ however , what ms @entity149 — unsurprisingly — failed to mention was that @entity1 ’s execution might never have been botched had it not been for @entity146			1
@entity170 of @entity7 ordered to halt the executions - demanding an independent review for the past four years , @entity146 has been vigorously lobbying governments and pharmaceutical companies to stop supplying the @entity175 @entity97 with drugs for executions			1
the campaign has been so successful that it has brought near chaos to the @entity175 justice system , as it has been denied supplies of the tried and tested drugs			0
as a direct consequence , the authorities have had to test new ‘ protocols ’ on their condemned prisoners — some of which have produced agonising and unnecessarily drawn - out deaths			0
the botched execution of @entity191 follows a similarly mishandled execution in january in @entity193 , when it took a 53 - year - old rapist and murderer called @entity197 nearly half an hour to die , during which time he was clearly contorted in agony			1
had the authorities had access to their normal drugs , it is likely @entity203 ’s execution would have passed in much the same way as that of the 52 other @entity193 prisoners killed by lethal injections			0
in fact , of the 1,300 prisoners the @entity175 has executed since it restored the death penalty in the @entity211 , nearly 1,200 have been killed by lethal injection			1
@entity146 ’s campaign , stop the @entity214 ( @entity215 ) started in 2010			1
in october of that year , the organisation discovered that a @entity145 firm , @entity217 , had made — but not knowingly supplied — the drug that was used in the execution in @entity220 of a murderer called @entity222			1
@entity146 lobbied the business secretary , @entity223 , to impose an export ban on the chemical			0
at first , @entity223 did not agree , but then , at the end of november 2010 , the business secretary acquiesced			0
the director of @entity146 , @entity228 , a high - profile @entity145 lawyer who has contested numerous death penalty cases in the @entity175 , clearly regarded this as a triumph for his campaign			0
‘ all politicians should be congratulated when they admit a mistake , ’ he said , ‘ and it is a credit to @entity223 that he has backed down			0
’ but @entity146 was not going to stop there			1
shortly afterwards , the group was tipped off that the @entity239 had been charged £ 4,528.25 in september 2010 for the supply of drugs normally used in executions by a company based in @entity244 , @entity144 , called @entity245			1
it is fair to say that @entity245 is not a pharmaceutical giant			0
in fact , its offices are based behind a shabby shop front for the @entity252			0
a tatty blue sign in the window states that it is also the home for @entity245			0
the company is run by @entity258 , and in january 2010 , he reported his firm as having an annual turnover of £ 844,229 , with a pre-tax profit of £ 94,460			0
until the 2010 export ban , it was quite legal for mr @entity258 to supply the drugs , and there is no suggestion that he has ever acted outside the law			0
when he was confronted by reporters at the time , mr @entity258 simply stated : ‘ it does not matter what i do			1
i am not even going to comment on anything			0
’ since then , @entity146 has successfully continued campaigning both in @entity145 and worldwide			0
towards the end of 2011 , the @entity272 also introduced an export ban			0
as a result , many @entity175 states have found it almost impossible to obtain execution drugs			0
lobby group @entity146 have called for @entity223 to to impose a ban on the chemical - which he first refused			0
he changed his mind in november 2010 some are resorting to desperate measures to get hold of them , and @entity285 has even imported drugs from @entity7 — which goes against its own state laws			0
with a shortage of drugs , some states are now considering resorting to the use of other methods of execution , some of which are far less humane than lethal injections			0
in @entity299 , for example , the state legislature has passed a bill that permits its @entity97 to use the electric chair if no drugs can be found			0
in @entity304 , one senator is demanding the return of firing squads			0
clearly , botched executions , the restoration of firing squads and electric chairs can all be regarded as constituting an enormously troubling — if unintended — fallout for @entity146 ’s campaign			2
naturally , ms @entity149 strenuously denies anything of the sort			0
‘ the execution of @entity191 was not an example of the wrong type of drugs being used to kill someone , but a particularly horrendous demonstration of the fact that there is no such thing as a “ humane ” lethal injection execution , ’ she told me			0
‘ it is a myth			0
botched lethal injection executions have been happening since prisons started using medicines that were intended to help people to kill them instead			2
’ whatever side of the debate people stand on , it is clear that in the future , judicial killings in the @entity175 could become more like sinister experiments than executions			2
no matter how unpalatable it sounds , it appears the road to a more hellish form of death has been paved by those with good intentions .			0
