by @entity0 published : 03:59 est , 12 april 2012 updated : 10:06 est , 18 april 2012 it has brought in 250 million animation lovers and is @entity4 's busiest tourist attraction but as @entity5 celebrates its 20th birthday today its crippling debts mean it is not an entirely happy one			1
despite charging its 15.7 million annual visitors an average of Â£ 51 to get in and meet @entity13 and friends it has been revealed the park near @entity5 owes a staggering 1.9 billion euros			2
and the financial outlook is no fairytale with its bosses saying it will take at least 12 years to pay off the mountain of debt			1
magic : @entity5 outshines all other tourist attractions outside @entity24 but as it turns 20 they have revealed a 1.9bn euro debt its popularity overshadows the 8.4 million visitors who go to see the @entity29 at the @entity30 annually and the 6.6 million who climb to @entity5 ' iconic @entity32			2
but @entity34 's risky decision to build its @entity4 park in an area often hit by cold and wet winters may not have paid off as it posted an overall loss of 55.6 million euros last year			1
and the financial austerity measures sweeping across @entity4 has also hit @entity5 , as for the first time it will have no ride set up to celebrate its birthday			1
despite the bleak financial picture visitors say they still love the park , with millions visiting from @entity46 every year , however , the park is not turning this into profit			0
popular : characters like the @entity50 help make the park @entity4 's most visited attraction but it is creaking under huge debts ' we 're students so we work very hard most of the time so it 's really nice to come away and do something really childish but really fun , ' @entity46 @entity54 and @entity55 told @entity60			1
' it 's magic , we 're in @entity64 , but it feels like we 're in another country altogether , ' @entity62 tourist @entity61 added			2
@entity34 had said when it launched the park in 1992 that they feared ' it would be too successful ' and when it opened cars queued in traffic for hours to get in			0
but a series of changes and financial problems followed			0
working his magic : @entity78 courts @entity79 as his family enjoys a weekend at the theme park to celebrate its 20th birthday this month a-list fan : actress @entity84 also spent the weekend at @entity5 for the celebrations bosses were forced to change the name from @entity5 to @entity5 because people linked ' @entity89 ' with business and finance not the glamour @entity24 associate with @entity4			1
they were also forced to overturn an alcohol ban because of the @entity64 love of wine and had a huge bank bailout in the 90s amid rumours that they were going bankrupt			0
it has also been unpopular with some french visitors and staff , being hit with protests , strikes and was even branded a ' @entity104 ' by experts 20 years ago			0
in nearby @entity108 , where the population leapt from 600 in 1990 to 6,000 after the park was built , its mayor @entity106 said many jobs pay ' barely above minimum wage , which is not at all what local people are looking for			2
' austerity : no new attractions like the park 's famous captain hook 's @entity117 have been built for the birthday success : the park opened with a bang in 1992 but it has been unpopular with the @entity64 and struggled because of the cold and wet @entity125 winters but despite the gloom its birthday will be well celebrated as there will be a ' @entity131 ' gala to mark the 20 - year milestone , with a laser show , water and fireworks			1
scores of celebrities have also been brought in to mark the birthday			0
@entity78 and family , actress @entity84 , singer @entity140 and even legendary footballer @entity139 embraced their inner child this month to celebrate the 20th anniversary of @entity5			0
@entity78 , his screenwriter wife @entity144 , and their three children cuddled up to @entity13 and @entity79 for a celebratory photoshoot and spent the weekend sampling the park 's best rides as thousands of visitors from around the world descended for the start of the @entity154 holidays			1
and it is rumoured owners are even mulling over the idea of a new park , ready for 2030 .			0

@entity4 's busiest tourist attraction will not pay it all off for at least 12 years
@entity125 cold and wet winters could be *damaging* the park 's profits
