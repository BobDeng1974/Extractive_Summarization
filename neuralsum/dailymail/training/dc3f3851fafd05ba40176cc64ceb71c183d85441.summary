while coaches speak of the value of experience at a @entity4 , it is inevitably the lesser heard - of young players who provide some of every tournament ’s stand - out moments			2
@entity8 has made the effort to inject his squad with young talent to spring a surprise on @entity14 ’s opponents , but across the competition other countries are doing the same with not - so - big names looking to make an impact			1
despite only making his international debut two years ago , @entity29 has quickly built up 21 caps for his country and will want to use the world stage to impress @entity32 boss @entity48			2
he has been dubbed the ‘ @entity58 ’ by @entity59 and even if they struggle in a tough group with @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 as rivals , @entity29 should get opportunities to show off his pace on the counter			2
time to shine : @entity32 fans will be eager to watch @entity29 in action for @entity30 this summer @entity62 ( @entity40 ) last year ’s @entity63 gave enough of a preview of @entity62 ’s talents to have a host of top clubs tailing him before he ended up at @entity69 for a fee of around £ 20million			1
despite a tough season in @entity73 , with problems on and off the field , the 21 - year - old made it into @entity77 ’s on the back of his past electric cameos for the @entity4 hosts			2
coming off the bench , @entity62 will be expected both to take advantage of space when @entity40 are leading games and to help break down sides when the host nation are chasing with his intelligent play which will be key to changing the flow of games			1
hopes of a nation : @entity62 is the youngest player in hosts @entity40 's squad for the @entity4 @entity94 ( @entity95 ) @entity95 will be far from favourites in @entity40 but having convinced talented right - sided attacking midfielder @entity94 to choose to play for them rather than @entity99 adds an impressive string to their bow			1
with his blistering pace and dribbling skills , @entity94 will be one to watch in @entity105 and has an eye for goal , as shown against @entity108 in the @entity110 semi-finals and in the five goals he already has for his country			0
@entity94 has criticised for his inconsistency and was subbed off on his only appearance on @entity116 soil against @entity117 but the @entity4 should bring out the best of him in a well - balanced side			0
@entity120 man : in @entity95 team lacking world class talent , @entity121 's @entity94 is the one to watch @entity124 ( @entity125 ) having only changed nationality after playing for a series of @entity129 youth sides in march , @entity124 has just two caps for the @entity125 under @entity131			1
the 19 - year - old made his debut for @entity135 ’s @entity134 and his impressed to an extent that @entity137 have identified him as a target to add some bite to @entity141 ’s new look midfield			0
having made it into the @entity125 roster ahead of @entity144 the pressure is on @entity124 , who is likely to be utilised as an impact substitute where his pace will trouble tiring defenders			1
pressure : @entity124 , featuring only for @entity134 's second team , replaced @entity151 for @entity53 @entity152 ( @entity153 ) all the fuss about @entity153 ’s midfield pre-tournament has been about creative sparks @entity157 and @entity158 , so much so that their 20 - year - old crucial cog in midfield has almost been ignored			1
interest from @entity163 and @entity164 brought his name into the public eye and despite a difficult start to the season , @entity152 has been quietly improving in a struggling @entity171 side			0
his combination of tidy passing and strong tackling in midfield is likely to draw more admirers this summer , both from @entity178 managers and those watching on at home			0
ignored : @entity152 will line up alongside @entity157 and @entity158 for @entity153 against @entity40 @entity181 ( @entity182 ) @entity183 is one of only two out - and - out strikers for @entity182 alongside @entity186 and having been nurtured as @entity188 ’s new ‘ prince ’ after the departure of @entity190			1
just 19 years old , @entity183 has the potential to be the complete package : matching his height with agility , trickery and a powerful shot			0
his pace stretches defences while his frame leaves markers constantly occupied			0
he offers the @entity202 another dimension to their play and although his talent is still very raw , he is the kind of player that often thrives in the spotlight that only a @entity4 can provide			0
goalscorer : @entity181 had a fine season in @entity99 , and will now be looking to shine for @entity182 in @entity40 @entity211 ( @entity212 ) it seems strange that a £ 36million player could go under the radar but @entity217 ’s lack of @entity219 football meant that @entity211 slightly avoided the spotlight this year			1
the 22 - year - old pulls the strings in midfield for club and country and his impressive turn of pace will get fans in @entity40 off their seats – provided he gets space now that injured team - mate @entity231 wo n’t be the centre of the defenders ’ attention			1
the pressure is on @entity237 ’s primary creative force in @entity231 ’s absence but if he can handle that and match his performances that put him into the @entity243 team of the season , @entity211 ’s drive could help guide his country through the latter stages			0
splashed the cash : £ 36m @entity217 star @entity211 pulls the strings for @entity212 in midfield @entity250 ( @entity251 ) @entity251 ’s place as a top seed in the @entity4 draw was ridiculed but their young players will be on a mission in @entity40 to prove that seeding right – with @entity211 keen to keep up their typically strong defensive record			1
the left back helped @entity261 to a fifth place finish in the @entity263 and is one of that rare breed that fans tend to love : a full back with an eye for goal			0
@entity211 is a free - kick specialist and finished the season with five league goals coupled with nine assists and will be looking for his first goal on the international stage this summer			0
solid : @entity250 has impressed at left - back for @entity251 and @entity261 despite his young age @entity278 ( @entity279 ) @entity279 ’s squad is full of young players but @entity278 is the brightest star after four seasons in the @entity263 at the age of just 21			2
blessed with two good feet and great pace , the @entity285 midfielder has the skillset to be a danger to any of the sides in @entity105 he has been criticised for taking too many shots – but that should prove entertaining on the big stage and if he can convert a couple of those efforts @entity279 could cause upsets			0
talented : @entity278 's dribbling skills from midfield make him @entity279 's main attacking threat @entity299 ( @entity300 ) for years @entity299 was flagged up by @entity302 devotees as one to watch , but his entire career so far has been spent in the @entity304 with @entity305 and more recently @entity306			1
the 23 - year - old prefers to play as a central playmaker but might find competition fierce there with @entity311 still running the show in midfield – and instead could be left to cut in from out wide or to make an impact from the bench			2
injury absence this season should leave him fresh to impress at the @entity4 and the @entity320 captain will be keen to show off the silky skills that had @entity322 interested earlier this year			0
hard work : blessed as a teenager , @entity299 has finally lived up to his early promise for the @entity300			2

@entity124 , @entity181 and @entity299 make the list
@entity329 starts on *thursday* with @entity40 vs @entity153
no @entity14 players make the top 10
