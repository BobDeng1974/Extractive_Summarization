breaking the law in old age may be a sign of dementia , doctors warn			1
criminal activites including theft , traffic violations , sexual advances , trespassing , and public urination , are common signs of the disease , especially in older adults who are first - time offenders			1
older adults whose personality appears to have changed or who engage in criminal behaviours might be doing so because their brain is becoming damaged by dementia			1
violence is one of the first symptoms of a little known type of dementia , but this condition is not often recognised by health providers or the authorities , researchers said			1
doctors warn criminal behaviour including theft , traffic violations , sexual advances , trespassing , and public urination in older people could be a sign of a rare type of dementia ad a result , family and friends who notice a relative who is acting outside of the norm should seek a medical evaluation as they may have a degenerative brain disease underlying their behaviour			1
the @entity48 researchers reviewed the medical records of 2,397 patients diagnosed with alzheimer 's disease or other types of dementia between 1999 and 2012			1
they scanned patient notes for entries about criminal behaviour using keywords like ' arrest , ' ' @entity59 ( @entity59 ) , ' ' shoplift ' and ' violence ' and uncovered 204 patients , or 8.5 per cent , who qualified			1
the researchers concluded their behaviours were more often an early sign of frontotemporal dementia ( @entity65 )			1
this is a rare type of dementia which can sometimes cause inappropriate behaviour in social situations , @entity71 dementia is similar to alzheimer 's disease in that it is caused by a build up of abnormal proteins in the brain , leading to a progressive loss of brain cells , and the affected areas functioning less well and shrinking			1
but it affects the frontal lobes of the brain , behind the forehead – which regulate our ability to plan and organise , and are important in regulating our behaviour			0
it also affects the temporal lobes on either side of the brain , which organise memory and language			0
this type of dementia causes slowly progressive problems with language , thinking , emotions and behaviour , and can profoundly alter a person 's character and social conduct			2
it was also more often an early sign of another type of dementia called ' primary progressive aphasia ' ( @entity105 ) , a type of language - deteriorating dementia , than of @entity107 's			1
of the ' criminal ' group of 204 patients , 64 had frontotemporal dementia , 24 had primary progressive aphasia , 42 had @entity107 's , and the rest had various other forms of dementia			1
patients with frontotemporal dementia or primary progressive aphasia tended to be younger , averaging 59 to 63 years old			2
this is compared to @entity107 's patients , who were an average age of 71 when their doctors made notes about criminal behaviours			2
researchers analysed the medical records of patients with dementia between 1992 and 2012 and found many of the patients who had engaged in criminal behaviour had frontotemporal dementia			1
violence is a common sign of this type of degenerative disease @entity71 dementia is a rare type of dementia caused by a build - up of abnormal proteins in the brain			1
the term ' dementia ' describes a loss of mental ability that is more than would be expected with ageing			2
it is sufficient to affect day - to - day activities and gets progressively worse			0
@entity71 dementia is similar to alzheimer 's disease in that it is caused by a build - up of abnormal proteins in the brain , leading to a progressive loss of brain cells			2
the affected areas of the brain gradually function less well and shrink			0
it tends to affect the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain ( the front and sides ) in particular , and often starts at a younger age than usually seen in alzheimer 's disease			0
the frontal lobes are at the front of the brain , behind the forehead – they regulate our ability to plan and organise ourselves and are important in regulating our behaviour			0
the temporal lobes are on either side of the brain above and behind the ears , and they organise memory and language			0
generally , frontotemporal dementia causes slowly progressive problems with language , thinking , emotions and behaviour			2
it can profoundly alter a person 's character and social conduct – for example , they may either become impulsive and much more outgoing , or uninterested and lacking in energy , depending on the type of disease they have			2
other typical symptoms include inappropriate behaviour in social situations and difficulty with speech			0
@entity71 dementia typically starts between the ages of 45 and 65 , although it can sometimes affect younger people as well as the elderly			0
source : @entity199 more than 6.4 per cent of those in the ' criminal group ' with frontotemporal dementia exhibited physical or verbal violence during their illness			1
but this was only seen in 3.4 percent of those with @entity105 and two percent of those with alzheimer 's disease , the researchers found			0
in four per cent of patients with frontotemporal dementia , violence was one of the first symptoms of their brain disease			1
men were considerably more likely than women to make sexual advances to others and to urinate in public			0
the study 's lead author , dr. @entity219 of the @entity221 , @entity48 , said if patients have a family history of dementia , it may be possible to connect new criminal behaviour to an underlying problem with the brain			2
' however , most of these diseases are " sporadic " - meaning they occur for no identifiable genetic cause and it is difficult to predict , ' he said			0
' in general , an early detection of changes in personality , deviation from what constituted a " norm " for a particular individual , should prompt an evaluation for possible brain causes			0
' early signs of frontotemporal dementia can include personality changes including disinhibition , lack of empathy , loss of motivation or apathy , or obsessive - compulsive behaviour , he said			1
' it is sometimes hard to wrap our minds around the concept that a specific part of our brain is not functioning properly , leading to behaviours that may range the gamut of disruptive , detached and sometimes criminal , ' dr @entity219 said			0
@entity262 and friends can easily take these behaviour changes personally , but they should understand that it may be the first sign of a disease and should request a medical evaluation , he added			2
@entity71 dementia spectrum disorders can be accurately diagnosed with positron emission tomography ( @entity271 ) scans and neuropsychological testing			0
however this can only happen if doctors recognise it could be the cause of the behaviour and think to test for it , dr @entity273 said			0
the study was published in the journal @entity281 .			0

personality change or criminal activity could be signs of dementia
violence is a sign of rare type of dementia called frontotemporal ( @entity65 )
doctors analysed medical records and found criminality linked to @entity65
advised families to seek a medical opinion if relative is acting *strangely*
