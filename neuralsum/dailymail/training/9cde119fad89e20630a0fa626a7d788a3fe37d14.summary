the @entity1 health secretary has turned down appeals to overrule a federal regulation that could save the life of a 10 - year girl who desperately needs a lung transplant or faces dying in the next three to five weeks			1
@entity8 secretary @entity7 described her decision as ‘ incredibly agonizing ’ when she told a congressional panel on tuesday that she wo n't intervene in a transplant decision to save a dying @entity13 girl			1
@entity14 does n’t qualify for an adult lung transplant until the age of 12 , according to federal regulations , @entity7 has the authority to waive that rule on her behalf			1
' it is in her legal authority			0
we 're going to let a kid die over red tape			0
somebody needs to stand up and say this is n't right			0
this is a human issue this is n't politics			0
’ @entity14 has been hospitalized at @entity41 for three months with end - stage cystic fibrosis and is on a ventilator			2
her family wants all children younger than 12 to be eligible for adult lungs because so few pediatric lungs are available			1
under current policy , only patients 12 and over can join the list			0
but @entity14 's transplant doctors say she is medically eligible for an adult lung			1
' incredibly agonizing ' : @entity1 @entity8 secretary @entity7 told a congressional panel on tuesday that she would n't overrule federal regulations to help save young @entity25 emotional : before wednesday 's reprieve @entity25 had said she refused to tell her young daughter just how sick she really is the change would add perhaps 20 children from ages 8 to 11 to the adult waiting list , which has more than 1,600 people on it , according to @entity64 , @entity14 's aunt			1
she said @entity7 ' remarks confused the family because they want a policy change for all pre-adolescent children awaiting lung transplants , not just @entity14			1
‘ one moment they say we 're asking for an exception for @entity14			2
the next moment they say we 're asking for sweeping changes and it has to be studied ’ @entity64 said tuesday			0
@entity7 has called for a review of pediatric transplant policies , but the @entity78 say @entity14 does n't have time for that			1
the issue has also become a political football , on tuesday @entity84 @entity83 accused @entity7 of refusing to save @entity14 at a @entity86 hearing on her department 's budget			1
‘ i 'm begging you			0
... she has three to five weeks to live			0
please suspend the rules , ’ rep. @entity89 , @entity90 , urged @entity7			2
@entity7 conceded the case was an ' incredibly agonizing situation ' but said many complex factors go into the transplant - list formula there is ' so much bullcrap around this place , and we have the chance to save someone ’s life - there ’s no logic to this , ' an agitated @entity89 said , as he and @entity7 at times talked over each other			1
' it simply takes your signature , ' rep. @entity110 , @entity111 , a former doctor and one of the @entity83 ’s most active @entity84 members on health policy , told @entity7			1
@entity110 said the policy review will take ' a year ' to complete - too long to be of any help to @entity14			2
' this young lady will be dead , ' @entity110 said			0
@entity7 conceded the case was an ‘ incredibly agonizing situation ’ but said many complex factors go into the transplant - list formula			1
‘ the medical evidence and the transplant doctors who are making the rule - and have had the rule in place since 2005 making a delineation between pediatric and adult lungs , because lungs are different that other organs - that it ’s based on the survivability [ chances ]			2
’ @entity7 reminded @entity89 that 40 people in @entity13 are on the ‘ highest acuity list ’ for lung transplants			1
fears : @entity25 and @entity140 filed an emergency motion for the temporary restraining order on wednesday morning , the day after @entity1 health secretary @entity7 had turned down their appeals researchers have less data on lung transplants in pre-adolescents because only about 20 a year are done			1
and young children suffer from different lung diseases , making it harder to weigh their risk versus their chance of surviving a transplant , according to a letter to @entity7 from dr. @entity156 @entity157 , president of the @entity158			1
amid concerns about the higher mortality rate in pediatric patients waiting for lung transplants , the network has tweaked its policies in recent years , @entity157 said			1
the new rules give the younger children priority over adults when adolescent lungs become available and give the sickest children priority in a 1,000 - mile radius , a broader range than used in the adult system , he said in the letter , which was shared by the office of rep. @entity176 , @entity177			2
@entity176 , in a letter to @entity7 , said @entity14 's doctors are confident they can perform a successful transplant on her			1
and he said she would jump to the top of the adult list if placed there , given the stage of her disease			0
@entity64 , the aunt , called it ‘ a question of morality ’ that children get a place in the adult line , given that a far higher percentage of children die waiting for pediatric lungs than do adults on that waiting list			2
‘ do you put them at the back of the line if you 're not sure how to measure ( their potential outcome ) ? or do you put them in the line ? ’ she said			0
@entity205 : despite her poor prognosis , @entity14 remains upbeat about her chances of getting a transplant celebration : @entity14 and her mom @entity25 are celebrating after a federal judge overruled a law preventing children under 12 from receiving adult organs the system determining who is allocated lungs for transplants was overhauled in 2004 and again in 2008			1
doctors claim the changes have allowed fewer people on the waiting list to die			2
the changes meant that lung transplants are allocated by age groups			1
those over the age of 12 are given an allocation score based on how urgently they need a transplant and the severity of their medical condition			2
those who would benefit most are placed highest and given first priority			0
for children under 12 , lungs are only allocated based on the time they 've spent on the list			2
one problem is that there are few pediatric lungs available for transplant			0
in 2012 , there were just 10 transplants for @entity14 's age group , but more than 1,700 for adults , according to the @entity158			1
on sunday @entity25 and @entity140 asked the public directly for a lung donation to help save their daughter 's life			1
' essentially , @entity14 has been left to die , ' @entity14 's parents said in the statement			1
@entity14 , from @entity254 , @entity13 , was born with cystic fibrosis and she now lives at @entity41 as her lungs continue to deteriorate			2
she relies on a ventilator to breathe and has been on the waiting list for new lungs for 18 months - and is top of the priority list for children in @entity263 , @entity264 , @entity265 , @entity13 , @entity266 and northern @entity267			0
her parents learned just weeks ago that @entity14 would be given a better chance if she were waiting for adult lungs , which are reserved for people aged 12 or over			1
' it should n't be about their age , ' she told @entity274			0
' if she 's the sickest person , she should qualify			0
' ' the law is , in my view , age discrimination , ' she added to the @entity279			0
' i do n't know if this is too late to make a difference for @entity14			0
but we 'll keep fighting it			0
' dr. @entity284 from @entity285 , who helped write the pediatric transplant system , said the case ' tugs at his heart ' but that no system is perfect			0
he said that if he changed the system for @entity14 's advantage , ' there 's another patient , very likely an adolescent , who gets a disadvantage '			1
' we 've built a system that tries to be as fair to everyone as possible , ' he contended			0
her parents are hopeful that the issue can be beaten by someone stepping forward with a direct donation to @entity14			2
support : @entity14 , who has been living in hospital since february , is pictured with her three younger siblings for now , they have decided not to tell @entity14 , who is the eldest of four siblings , just how sick she is			0
' i 'm not going to tell her she 's dying , because she 's 10 , ' @entity25 told @entity274			0
' i 'm going to tell her we 're going to keep fighting			0
i do n't want to scare her			0
' @entity14 , who has been outside just twice in the last 100 days , said that she misses school , where she could ' at least try and act like all the other normal children '			2
but even as her lungs deteriorate , the young girl remains positive , certain that she will beat her illness and be granted a lung transplant			1
' we will [ get them ] ! ' she said			0
' i ca n't wait to take my first breath with new lungs			0
i can close my eyes right now and imagine it ... i 'm never going to quit ! never , never ! ' holding on : @entity14 's mother said her eldest daughter has just three to five weeks left to live			1

doctors say @entity14 , 10 , will die in three to five weeks unless she gets a lung transplant
@entity1 health secretary @entity7 has refused to overrule a federal regulation which states a patient has to 12 to get an adult transplant
@entity14 's mom has accused @entity7 of doing nothing to help her daughter and other children needing lung transplants
the issue has also become a political hot topic with *republicans* urging @entity7 to think again
on sunday the family made a public plea for a donor
