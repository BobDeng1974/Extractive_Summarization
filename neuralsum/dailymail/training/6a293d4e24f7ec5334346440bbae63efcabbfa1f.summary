@entity2 rugby ’s elite competition returns this weekend under an unfamiliar guise with a new name , a new format and a new trophy			1
and former @entity8 international @entity7 says he is ‘ salivating ’ at the prospect of watching the continent ’s best in action in a revitalised tournament			1
it has taken more than two years for the @entity2 leagues to resolve the issue of how to re-format the @entity16 in order to ensure the @entity18 and @entity19 are kept happy – as well as to maximise the potential riches on offer to each club – but now they seem to have settled on a competition which has intrigue in almost every single match - up			1
representatives of the @entity28 clubs competing for the new @entity29 , which starts on friday - ( from left ) @entity30 ( @entity31 ) , @entity32 ( @entity33 ) , @entity34 ( @entity35 ) , @entity36 ( @entity37 ) , @entity38 ( @entity39 ) , @entity40 ( @entity41 ) and @entity42 ( @entity43 ) @entity44 pundit @entity7 is ' salivating ' at the thought of the @entity46 the inaugural @entity29 , which begins on friday when @entity33 host @entity49 side @entity47 at @entity51 , will see five pools of four – as opposed to the six groups of four in the @entity16 – battle it out to qualify for the last eight			1
pool winners are guaranteed qualification , while the three best runners - up will also progress , meaning competition will be more fierce than ever and even one home loss could mean the difference between potentially winning the competition and going home early			2
and @entity44 rugby pundit @entity7 , who scored 33 tries in 72 internationals for @entity8 and one in seven @entity68 appearances for the @entity69 , told @entity70 : ‘ you look at the quality this year of the teams and the groups and how close they ’re likely to be you salivate the prospect because there ’s no breathing space			1
there will be pressure , intensity , challenges			0
that ’s what you get with the elite comp			2
‘ three second - placed teams means sides are going to scrap for every single bonus point			0
because of the quality of the pools as well there are going to be some top - end teams who are n’t even going to make it through to the knockout stages			0
‘ quality is always quality no matter if the competition and format has changed			2
i suppose what does change is that now there ’s five pools instead of four it means it ’s a far harder task to rest players and to rotate players because there ’s no respite			0
’ the 50 - year - old , who was dubbed ‘ @entity113 ’ during his playing days by legendary commentator @entity110 for his exceptional poise when running with the rugby ball , is amazed by the strength and competition in every single group			1
( left to right ) @entity117 of @entity118 , @entity119 of @entity31 , @entity36 of @entity37 , @entity40 of @entity120 , @entity38 of @entity39 , @entity34 of @entity35 , @entity32 of @entity33 , @entity42 of @entity121 and @entity122 of @entity123 pose with the the two trophies during the @entity125 and @entity127 @entity126 @entity33 director of rugby @entity128 during the @entity129 at @entity51 ‘ if you look at @entity133 – @entity134 , @entity37 ( @entity37 ) , @entity135 – all these sides would expect to get into the last four and beyond , ’ the former winger continued			1
‘ you have three potential winners and three semi-finalists from last season in one group			0
where ’s the easy game ? ‘ ( @entity41 ) @entity120 have got @entity143 and @entity144 – @entity144 are top of the @entity147 @entity146 at the moment			0
there ’s very little respite there and we can have some surprises but a team will rise to the top in this competition – it always does			2
’ @entity7 won the now defunct @entity16 with @entity39 in 1998 and he has been impressed with the dynamism on offer in the @entity160 side ’s backline this season			1
and the ( now unlikely ) prospect of the @entity164 @entity163 returning to @entity28 to play at @entity165 in order to force his way into @entity170 ’s @entity28 @entity169 squad is one which @entity7 would welcome			1
‘ @entity163 really adds to the storyline going into this weekend ’s games – will he play for @entity174 , will he not play for @entity174 ? he would be a huge coup for whoever could snap him up			0
‘ the talk all week has been about who is coming back from @entity49			0
will @entity163 come back ? will @entity179 and @entity180 come back to the @entity118 regions ? ‘ if @entity163 was to go to @entity39 he would be a huge signing			0
not that they need strengthening in that area – we do n’t know where @entity186 is going to play – but they also have @entity189 to come back			0
to have @entity189 and @entity163 – well that would be an interesting one for them ! ‘ you are not going to sniff at an opportunity to have @entity163 though because he has been sensational for @entity174			0
@entity194 is not an award that @entity49 teams hand out lightly			0
‘ i ’d be surprised if @entity174 let him go but you never know with ( owner ) @entity200 – they could be chasing @entity201 ! ’ @entity174 forward @entity163 will not be returning to the @entity18 with @entity39 @entity28 legend @entity202 became the last man to lift the @entity16 for @entity174 in may the @entity205 flyer , who captained @entity8 to the 1994 @entity208 title , expects the usual suspects to compete for the first @entity29 title – with @entity35 having too many injuries to really challenge and former side @entity39 being too early in their development to contend with the continent ’s elite – but he believes one @entity216 side could be a dark horse this year			1
@entity7 explained : ‘ the four favourites in most bookies ’ minds are probably double - champions @entity174 , @entity135 , plus @entity120 and @entity37			1
‘ i ’m interested to see if @entity221 can start to find their @entity2 performances step - up a notch			2
we ’ve seen their domestic performances really improve but are they capable of stepping - up in @entity2 ? that ’s an interesting one for me			2
‘ @entity174 , having so much depth , you have still got to fancy them though			0
’ in that sense , the more that things change , the more they stay the same … @entity44 ’ biggest ever season of rugby includes more than 360 matches from competitions including the @entity29 , @entity19 , @entity146 and @entity235 .			1
