@entity21 officials who investigated the group of 16 academies - the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) - also criticised £ 45,000 expenses awarded in a year to just two governors , a £ 20,000 fact - finding trip to @entity27 and excessive spending on hotels , meals and alcoholic drinks			1
dubious : payments from the @entity16 included £ 28,000 in rent of office space in @entity35 , near @entity36 , ( pictured ) to the wife of founder sir @entity15 further concerns were raised over family members being given unadvertised jobs - including a director of communications on £ 70,000 - a - year - while £ 1,000 was spent on @entity43 cards and £ 630 on customised umbrellas			1
the @entity16 admitted that wine was purchased for a workshop with head teachers - as part of a training exercise designed to show that children , like grapes , can mature into ‘ exceptional wines ’ given the right nurturing or merely end up as ‘ plonk ’			1
sir @entity15 ’s links both to education and the @entity57 stretch back decades			1
he was tutored at @entity59 by @entity60 , who later became archbishop of @entity9			0

the @entity16 said he had also now retired from the trust			1
officials from the @entity21 ’s @entity80 probed financial practices at the @entity16 after a review of 2012/13 accounts highlighted ‘ highly unusual ’ payments			2
these included nearly £ 28,000 in rent and insurance premiums to @entity87 , who is listed as owning cottages which the trust uses as an office			1
in a report , the agency said there was evidence ‘ that the lease rental was a fair market price from an estate agent ’ and that alternative premises were checked			0
‘ however there was no documented evidence provided to record the outcome of the inspections or the basis for the final decision to lease the current accommodation , ’ it said			0
checks by the @entity109 revealed the two grade ii listed stone cottages with thatched roofs under @entity87 ’s name were leased to the @entity16 after failed attempts to find a private residential tenant			1
official documents from @entity116 show they were used by the @entity69 - the schools chain sir @entity15 previously headed - until it moved to larger premises			1
@entity119 changes were made to make it suitable for residential use and it was put on the market through a letting agent in september 2011			0
the council documents state : ‘ as of 16th december no tenant had been found			0
‘ the applicant ’s husband discovered the need to use the building as an office once again for his personal business			2
’ another cottage in the same lane in the picture postcard village of @entity35 , near @entity36 , is registered to @entity87			0
all the properties are next to the couple ’s home , which is in both their names and was valued at £ 1 million in 2010			2
it is hidden at the end of a long gravel driveway and is set in extensive landscaped grounds with a swimming pool			0
a woman who answered the door of the cottages said they were still being used by the @entity16			1
the @entity152 probe also raised concerns about £ 90,000 awarded to sir @entity15 as chairman of the trust - as well as ‘ transactions with companies in which the chairman has a controlling interest ’			1
the trust said £ 90,000 was paid to sir @entity15 because he was also chief executive at the time			1
but the investigation found that sir @entity15 was forbidden from holding both roles under trust rules			1
the trust , which has a turnover of £ 10million per year and lists 16 member schools on its website , was found to have committed ‘ significant breaches of the @entity170 , @entity172 regulations and the @entity173 ’			2
a report on the findings , which is redacted in places , makes 26 separate recommendations			0
it highlights a series of questionable uses of public money including a £ 20,000 trip to @entity27 by a group of heads			1
the report said it may not have been ‘ the best use of public funds ’			0
expenses exposed : the @entity16 runs a chain of 16 academies ( stock image ) two governors ‘ claimed £ 45,000 in expenses and other supplies and services ’ while one academy in the group suffered a £ 38,000 fraud because it security software was not up - to - date , enabling a transfer out of its bank account			1
the money is reportedly being reimbursed by the bank			0
the report also highlights that expenses policy allowed for ‘ moderate consumption of alcohol ’ - even though alcohol spending is considered an ‘ improper use of public funds ’			2
‘ a number of claims were made that included the purchase of alcohol , ’ the report said			0
meals and hotels were also claimed ‘ in excess of the staff expenses policy ’			2
concern was also raised over unadvertised posts for family members			0
‘ we found that a number of the appointed head office staff were family members of either trustees or senior members of staff , ’ said the report			2
there had been no ‘ competition or advertising ’ of the posts , which included a director of communication at a salary of £ 70,000 per year plus benefits			2
meanwhile a finance manager had been appointed on £ 100 an hour with no formal tender for the work			0
it was ‘ questionable ’ whether this was value for money , said the report			0
more than half of secondary schools - and growing numbers of primaries - now have academy status which allows them to operate outside local council control			0
but there have been a series of financial scandals involving some of the groups which run academies , leading to calls for tighter controls			0
the agency issued the trust with a financial notice to improve			0
a spokesman for the @entity16 said : ‘ the @entity80 are very clear that all issues found are from pre-september - before significant structural changes were made and @entity264 was appointed as ceo			2
‘ the @entity266 had already commenced on change of policies and governance in november 2013 , before the review took place			0
‘ the @entity80 acknowledged to @entity266 that it was under a different structure and clear evidence was showing that there was a positive change in the operation since september 2013			0
’ sir @entity15 was n’t available to comment and his wife refused to comment when approached at their home			1
‘ i have n’t got time , ’ she said			0
@entity282 said sir @entity15 retired as chairman of the @entity62 on march 31 as part of a ‘ planned transition ’			1
a spokesman for the @entity21 said : ‘ the @entity80 has undertaken a financial review on @entity288 and is working with them to agree an action plan to address the issues raised			0
we have issued the @entity16 with a @entity293 to improve and if they do not take the necessary steps , we will not hesitate to take further action			2
‘ academies operate under a strict system of oversight and accountability - more robust than in council - run schools - which means any issues are identified and that we can take swift action to address them			2
