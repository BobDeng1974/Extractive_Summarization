by @entity0 published : 03:53 est , 1 october 2012 updated : 11:48 est , 1 october 2012 bookies were counting the cost of @entity5 's @entity4 victory after a stunning final - day comeback was rounded off by a remarkable gesture of sportsmanship by @entity10 's @entity9			1
@entity12 's side recorded a 14½ to 13½ outright win in @entity14 , @entity15 , following a string of heroic performances by the likes of @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			0
they played their part in ensuring @entity5 retained the trophy they won two years ago , but it was @entity27 who handed them outright victory in the final match of the tournament			1
by beating @entity33 in the final pairing of the weekend he could have at least ensured a 14 - 14 draw for the @entity10			2
and in a show of sportsmanship , he declined to force @entity46 to make a putt from a similar distance , thus conceding the hole to the @entity50 and leaving their match all - square			1
the gesture handed @entity5 an outright win that few would have predicted at the start of the day , leaving the @entity5 fans cheering - and the bookies fuming after they saw a flurry of bets placed from the optimistic few who did fancy the unlikely result			1
the betting firms today admitted they were facing a combined multi-million payout in what was their most expensive ever @entity4 , despite the fact that just moments earlier they had been looking at their ideal result of a draw			2
the unlikely comeback cost @entity70 £ 650,000 and @entity71 £ 400,000 , while other bookmakers also reported heavy losses			1
two punters even bet £ 500,000 on @entity5 to win as the odds fell last night			1
disappointment : it was a dismal three days for @entity9 in which he failed to win a single match @entity79 lost £ 500,000 - £ 400,000 of which was online , and £ 100,000 in stores			1
@entity83 lost around £ 800,000 , @entity82 suffered a £ 400,000 hit and @entity84 lost £ 500,000			1
industry experts said the late drama cost @entity88 betting companies around £ 10million in total			1
a @entity70 spokesman told @entity91 today : ‘ no - one bets on a tie			1
it cost us just over £ 650,000 last night on @entity9 ’s miss. @entity9 is not a bookie ’s friend this morning			1
‘ at 8:20pm , @entity5 were 33/1 to win and @entity10 were 1/50			1
it was a nightmare result			0
the @entity10 were heavily backed pre-tournament			0
it was our most expensive one ever			0
’ @entity5 's team staged a remarkable comeback to retain the @entity4 , battling from 10 - 6 down overnight - having trailed 10 - 4 - to beat the @entity10 14½ to 13½ in @entity41 , @entity15			1
after @entity5 reached the 14 points they required to retain the cup , @entity9 knew heading to the 18th tee that the @entity10 could no longer win			1
he later claimed neither he nor the @entity10 wanted to salvage a tie			0
after @entity9 missed his final putt , he conceded one from a similar length to halve his contest with @entity46 - a putt which he would have been expected to hold			2
a @entity84 spokesman told @entity112 : ‘ while it was impossible not to get caught up in such a fantastic victory , @entity9 's miss resulted in us taking a really heavy beating			0
@entity5 win : @entity33 of @entity50 celebrates with his caddie @entity119 on the 18th green after halving his match with @entity9 on sunday at @entity122 despondent : @entity10 's @entity9 walks off the course as @entity5 celebrate their win at the @entity4 savouring the moment : players pour champagne on @entity5 's @entity129 as they celebrate after winning emotional moment : @entity131 captain @entity12 of @entity132 reacts during his speech at the closing ceremony of the 39th @entity4 at the @entity122 up we go : @entity5 golfers hold captain @entity12 on their shoulders as they pose for a team photo ‘ ( but ) our decision to pay out on both ( @entity142 ) @entity141 and @entity33 securing the winning points will have made the night even more special for those who kept the faith			1
’ the @entity5 team said they drew inspiration for the remarkable turnaround from @entity149 , the @entity132 former world number one who died last may aged 54 after a battle with cancer			2
' no - one bets on a tie			0
it cost us just over £ 650,000 last night on @entity9 ’s miss. @entity9 is not a bookie ’s friend this morning ' @entity70 spokesman a @entity71 spokesman told @entity91 : ‘ it was the biggest betting @entity4 we 've ever had			1
during the first two days confidence was a bit shot			0
people did n't really back @entity5 then			2
‘ we were staring at the ideal result when @entity9 was at the final hole			0
had it been a tie we would have kept everything we 'd taken because no - one backs a draw			2
but it was a £ 400,000 hit			1
’ @entity71 said that @entity20 is now at 50/1 , down from 150/1 , to be crowned @entity170 - and in any other year the golfer would be favourite for the prize			2
‘ but after such a vintage year for @entity88 sport , he is still behind the likes of @entity176 , @entity177 , and of course our great olympians and @entity180 , ’ the @entity71 spokesman added			1

@entity9 normally costs us because he wins , but this time he cost us because he lost			2
' it was mad the way it changed it the last round			0
it was an unbelievable night , but it cost us a fortune ' @entity83 spokesman ' at the beginning of sunday it was 7/1 for @entity5 to come back			1
when @entity20 was on the 12th on saturday and it looked as if it would get even worse , @entity5 were at 9/1			2
' a @entity83 spokesman said : ' it was mad the way it changed it the last round			0
it was an unbelievable night , but it cost us a fortune			2
' and a @entity82 spokesman said : ' it cost us a lot of money but sometimes you 've got to pay out with a smile			0
it was a bad night for the bookies , but a great night for sport			0

' we were staring at the ideal result when @entity9 was at the final hole			0
had it been a tie we would have kept everything we 'd taken because no - one backs a draw			0
but it was a £ 400,000 hit ' coral spokesman a devastated @entity9 added : ‘ it was already over ( on the 18th )			1
we came here as a team - this is a team event			0
and the cup was already been retained by @entity5 , so it was already over			0
‘ you come here as a team and you win or lose as a team , and it 's pointless to even finish			0
so 18 was just , hey , get this over with			0
congratulations to the @entity5 team			0
’ that incident rounded off a dismal three days for @entity9 in which he failed to win a single match			0
@entity280 presenter @entity279 said on @entity281 : ' well that is a gracious thing for @entity9 not to make @entity33 hole out			0
@entity5 come back from 10 - 4 down to win 14.5 - 13.5 @entity285 ' the defeat was largely ignored on most @entity10 newspaper front - pages , but the @entity288 and @entity289 both carried reports , with the headlines ' shock and @entity293 ' and ' @entity294 '			1
' @entity291 and @entity293 ' : the @entity288 dedicated much of their front page on monday to this picture less prominence : the @entity289 ( left ) had a medium - sized piece on the front page about the @entity4 ; while the @entity300 ( right ) chose to have a small box at the bottom of its front page on monday anguish : the @entity306 ( left ) featured contrasting images on the front page , but the @entity309 ( right ) decided to largely ignored the loss , like many other papers in the @entity10 video : @entity9 graciously concedes defeat			0

industry experts say late drama cost @entity88 betting companies £ 10million
unlikely @entity5 comeback cost @entity70 £ 650,000 and @entity71 £ 400,000
two punters even bet £ 500,000 on @entity5 to win as odds fell last night
woods missed simple three - foot par putt on 18th green which lost match
bookmakers were *hoping* for draw because few punters had bet on that
