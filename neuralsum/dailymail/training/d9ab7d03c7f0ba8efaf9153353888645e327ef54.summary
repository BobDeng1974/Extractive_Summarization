' it went on to say that lone operatives would provide police very few opportunities to detect and stop the potential mayhem and destruction they were plotting			0
@entity7 in particular has become a prime target because extremist groups think of it as ' @entity52 ' , a security expert told @entity53			1
a tweet , posted on june 20 , has been discovered , showing pictures of the @entity56 in @entity7 and the @entity25 with a message reportedly from the @entity58 ( @entity9 or @entity9 )			1
it reads : ' we are in your state / we are in your cities / we are in your streets / you are our goals anywhere			1
' the brutal capabilities of @entity9 were revealed on tuesday after a stomach - churning video released showed the beheading of @entity68 photojournalist @entity67 at the hands of a hooded militant			1
at a press briefing on thursday , defense secretary @entity71 said the @entity68 military 's job is to ' get ready ' for whatever battle might lie ahead			1
@entity9 is ' as sophisticated and well - funded as any group that we have seen , ' @entity76 said , appearing alongside @entity79 general @entity80			1
' they 're beyond just a terrorist group , ' @entity76 said			2
' they marry ideology and a sophistication of strategic and tactical military prowess			0
they are tremendously well - funded			0
... this is beyond anything we 've seen , so we must prepare for everything			0
' the video , uploaded to jihadi websites on tuesday , shows @entity68 journalist @entity67 being decapitated by a @entity9 extremist ' it 's a long - term threat , ' he conceded under questioning from reporters , adding moments later that ' the president has been very clear on mission creep			1
and he 's made it very clear that he will not allow that			0
' gen. @entity80 warned that @entity68 's involvement in @entity104 will continue for years to come , citing the intensity of hatred among ethnic , religious and tribal groups there			1
' the conflict against those groups – most of which are local , some of which are regional , and some of which are global in nature – that 's going to be a very long contest , ' he said			0
it 's religious in many cases			0
so , yes , it 's going to be a very long contest			0
' a @entity68 senator also said on thursday that @entity9 , the militant terror group sweeping across @entity104 , aims to destroy an @entity68 city and is working on a plan to do it			1
' they 're crazy out there and they 're rapidly developing a method of blowing up a major @entity68 city and people just ca n't believe that 's happening , ' @entity126 senator @entity126 told the @entity133 - 25 television in @entity134			1

' a frustrated @entity126 also said on thursday night that he feared president @entity151 is n't up to the task , despite the tough words he delivered on wednesday before hitting the golf course			0
' @entity151 's lofty rhetoric is undermined by fainthearted follow - through and lack of meaningful action , ' he told the @entity141			0
' the president 's limited strikes in @entity104 have not halted @entity9 ' momentum but only temporarily redirected it , ' said @entity126			2
' without sustained pressure , @entity9 will regroup and continue its campaign of terror			2
' ' we 're in the most dangerous position we 've ever been in as a nation , ' he told @entity133 - 25			0
the president told a global audience this week from his @entity171 vacation spot that the @entity68 ' will continue to do what we must do to protect our people			2
' ' we will be vigilant and we will be relentless			0
when people harm @entity68 , anywhere , we do what 's necessary to see that justice is done			2
' ' we act against @entity9 , standing alongside others , ' @entity151 added , hinting at his ' coalition ' strategy rather than a plan to strike unilaterally with overwhelming @entity68 force			1
@entity126 , though , warned that without a concrete plan , @entity151 's words ring hollow			0
' relentless ' : @entity151 drew fire this week for golfing as an angry nation mourned the death of journalist @entity67 at the hands of an @entity9 militant ' you have to come up with something that we 're going to do , ' the senator said , ' because they 're holding another hostage in place			1
' ' and the problem is , the president , quite frankly – he says all these things and he never does them			0
' with the right strategy , he added , the @entity68 could defeat @entity9 on its home turf before the threat arrives on @entity68 's doorstep			1
' this idea that they 're coming and infiltrating the @entity68 – sure , some are coming in who have had an association with @entity9			1
but the majority of them are still over there , ' he said			0
the senator also defended the @entity68 government 's sweeping intelligence programs that have drawn barbs from civil libertarians , suggesting that information dragnets would play a part in keeping @entity9 at bay			1
' you have to have an intelligence process going on to stop attacks on @entity68 , ' he said .			2

a tweet , posted on june 20 , showed pictures of the @entity56 in @entity7 and the @entity25
the message reportedly from @entity9 read : ' we are in your state / we are in your cities / we are in your streets / you are our goals anywhere
