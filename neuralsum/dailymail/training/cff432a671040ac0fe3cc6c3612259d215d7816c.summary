rating : well - to - do folk from the @entity1 used to meet their accountants and financial advisers here			1
a quick dash to @entity6 before the fiscal year ended ; tea and biscuits , sign a few documents and then back on the train well before rush - hour			1
many years later , the whole @entity14 area hit the buffers , taking the @entity16 with it			1
but now it ’s back , albeit in an unrecognisable form			2
and it appears to be thriving			2
a phoenix from the flames : the @entity16 has undergone significant refurbishment i have trouble finding the entrance			1
once inside , the reception is absurdly poky - a corridor with a desk in it			1
there is no sense of occasion fetching up here			2
the cheapest rooms are called couchette , s and come in around the £ 200 mark , without breakfast			1
that ’s a lot of money for a tiny space where you can enter the rock - hard bed from only one side , because it ’s rammed against the window and sandwiched between two walls			1
in fact , the bathroom is about the same size as the bedroom			2
‘ an evocation of the classic continental railway sleeper , ’ is how the hotel ’s website describes it			1
cramped , in other words			2
when checking in , i had asked whether the window could open and the receptionist did n’t have a clue but said a colleague would let me know			0
i ’ve booked a table in the restaurant - called @entity62 - but they are all full , so i agree to have a drink in the slinky bar ( dark - green walls and proper art ) as long as i can order from there			1
but no one comes near me			0
eventually , a table opens up			0
it ’s a buzzy dining room and the staff rush around trying to keep everyone happy			0
wonderfully fresh dressed crab , with a big @entity76 lamb chop to follow keeps me very happy indeed			0
there ’s something to be said for a smart restaurant attached to a major train station			1
it gives you a sense of going somewhere , even though you might be taking the bus to @entity85 afterwards			0
getting back to my couchette overlooking the glass roof of the concourse is n’t thrilling , but the ‘ in - room entertainment package ’ sounds exciting , with 72 films on offer for no extra charge			2
the dining room is especially inviting at breakfast , with its sash windows , comfy banquettes and wooden floors			0
and i like that one of the healthy options is a spelt bun , poached egg and spinach			0
there is a traffic jam at reception , with a queue of people waiting to pay			0
one man gets cross and says he ’s about to miss his train			0
then some @entity111 tourists arrive with an entourage of suitcases			0
this would never have happened in the lobby of the old @entity16			1
