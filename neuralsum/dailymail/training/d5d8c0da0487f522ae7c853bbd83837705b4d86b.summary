@entity2 , a swimming coach from @entity3 , completed his 20 year dream by being the 18th person to finish the brutal triathlon			1
but he did more than just finish , @entity2 ran 144 kilometres from @entity16 's @entity21 to the @entity23 coast , swam the @entity24 to the @entity26 coast , and hopped on a bike to complete the triathlon in a 291 kilometre cycle to the @entity30 in @entity17			1
his time was an extraordinary 61 hours , beating the previous record by more than 12 hours			1
while speaking with @entity1 , @entity2 modestly jokes that his time could have been even better if it was n't for the wrong turn he took while running through @entity16 and brutal water conditions in the @entity24			1
' i actually thought i could go 10 hours quicker and if i had a half decent channel window and i did n't take that wrong turn at the beginning i would have - so seven or so hours added on to that and that 's the rub of the green , ' he said			0
he said leading up to the event he would try to get as much training done without breaking down - every tuesday he swam 15 kilometres , on the weekend he would run up to 100 kilometres and on every other day he complete four to six hours of swimming and riding			2
but nothing would compare to what lay ahead			0
' it was a real roller - coast			0
' there was a time i contemplated pulling out ; i was upset that i had got such a bad hand but then i thought i did all this training and stop feeling sorry for myself			2

' it was quite emotional for a lot of people around him and everyone was so determined to support him			0
