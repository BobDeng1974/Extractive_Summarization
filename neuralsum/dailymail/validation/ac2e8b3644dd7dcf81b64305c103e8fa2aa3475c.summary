contractors building a highway tunnel under @entity2 are preparing to remove the world 's largest boring machine so that it can be repaired			1
the gigantic drill , known as @entity6 , stopped working in december 2013 after digging just 1,000ft of its two - mile journey to replace the aging @entity9 , which was damaged in 2001 by an earthquake			1
its stalling left crews working on the $ 80million project scrambling to determine how to rescue and repair the five - storey , 2,000 - ton drill			1
but , using its own power , it was able bore through nearly 20 feet of concrete last month to break through a wall leading to the rescue pit 's opening , and it is now ready to be extracted			1
now managers of the project are preparing to show off the cutting head as the refurbishment takes place			0
it will then be shown off the media the machine had experienced various mechanical issues , including increased temperatures , before it stalled out there had been concern that @entity6 , buried 120 feet underground , might not be able to move itself to the pit opening because it had experienced various mechanical issues , including increased temperatures , before it stalled out			1
the machine 's breakdown and other construction issues have left the project two years behind schedule and sparked concern about cost overruns and other unforeseen obstacles			2
supporters , including @entity2 mayor @entity60 , have said it was important to make sure the corridor project is completed			2
the original highway overhaul was expected to cost $ 2 billion and be completed by 2015			2
the new timeline for replacing the busy @entity65 , damaged in a 2001 earthquake , is 2017			0
state transportation officials , contractor @entity68 ( @entity69 ) , and manufacturer @entity70 were readying next steps in @entity6 's removal and repair , a project spokeswoman said on friday			1
' @entity69 has told us that taking the machine apart and lifting it to the surface will take significant time and effort , ' a statement said			0
along with mechanical issues , the project has been set back by other concerns			0
in february , four men at the site were injured when a rebar wall collapsed , causing them to fall 25 feet			0
two @entity2 firefighters walked about a half mile into the @entity90 99 tunnel and carried out one of the injured men while the others walked out			0
a fifth worker escaped injury , while his four colleagues were taken to @entity98 , he said			0

gigantic *device* , known as @entity6 , stopped working in december 2013 after digging just 1,000ft of a highway tunnel
it left crews scrambling to determine the best way to fix the drill - which weighs around 2,000 tons
@entity6 was able to use its own power to break through 20ft of concrete and make its way to a pit opening
it will now be lifted out of the pit as the damage to the front section is fixed
