by @entity0 published : 05:15 est , 20 february 2014 @entity2 : 10:50 est , 20 february 2014 @entity3 has agreed the fundamental details of his new £ 300,000 - a - week contract at @entity6 but the deal has been held up by haggling over image rights			1
it is understood that the @entity6 striker and his representatives have declared themselves happy with the fine details of the 28 - year - old ’s salary and bonus structure			0
making his point : @entity3 should pen a huge £ 300,000 - a - week deal at @entity6 in a matter of days back : @entity3 returned to training on wednesday after the team 's five - day break in @entity22 however , @entity3 can not actually sign the deal until a couple of issues over image rights are ironed out			1
united chief executive @entity27 is confident that can be sorted out over the course of thursday and or friday and there is still an outside chance that confirmation of a new five - and - half - year deal could be made before close of play on friday			0
if that does n’t happen , though , it may have to wait until after @entity6 return from @entity39 duty in @entity40 next week			2
keeping up morale : @entity42 has managed to tie @entity3 down on a five - year deal going nowhere : it looks as though @entity3 will see out the remainder of his career at @entity48 , giving up on his dream of moving to @entity51 @entity6 are relaxed about the situation with sources revealing on wednesday that the details of @entity3 ’s pay and the length of the contact were actually sorted out some weeks ago			2
they want to announce the deal as soon as possible to give the club and its manager @entity42 a boost ahead of some important games in the weeks to come			0
@entity6 – seventh in the @entity64 and seemingly out of the running for the @entity39 places – are away at @entity67 on saturday evening and then fly to @entity68 for their @entity39 game at @entity70			1
after that @entity6 are away at @entity71 , also in the @entity64			0
break : @entity3 's wife @entity73 is in @entity74 on a holiday with sons @entity76 and @entity78 say cheese ! @entity73 and @entity78 smile for the camera while @entity3 finalises his £ 300k - a - week deal at @entity48 nearly : united executive vice chairman @entity27 ( left ) could complete the deal this week turning point ? @entity3 agreeing to sign a new deal is a major coup for under - fire manager @entity42			1
