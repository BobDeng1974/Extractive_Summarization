by @entity0 follow @ @ laura_mail @entity1 made her entrance late , slipping into the last vacant seat on the front row of the @entity7 players ’ box after @entity8 had basked in the warm , appreciative roar of a near - capacity crowd			1
this was his moment to savour			0
one the @entity14 had told him over dinner on wednesday night to try and enjoy			0
after all , you never know when it will happen again			0
it is only seven years since @entity1 experienced the same sensation of being introduced as a defending champion at the @entity21			2
she was 27 then , the same age as @entity8 now , but her straight - sets win over @entity24 was not accompanied by the same sense of history and emotion as the return of @entity30 ’s first male singles champion for 77 years			2
box seat : @entity1 returned to @entity7 as @entity8 's coach @entity35 's welcome : @entity8 is given a standing ovation on his return to defend his @entity39 title been there , done that ! @entity1 reacts after winning the 2006 championships accordingly , @entity1 seemed intent on making sure this was all about ‘ the pupil ’ , as @entity8 called himself , and not his teacher , who eventually fell in the fourth round against @entity47 in 2007			1
it helped that this was such a business - like encounter for the @entity30 @entity52 but , apart from adopting @entity8 ’s @entity54 - branded kit instead of the @entity56 sportswear she wore as a player , @entity1 seemed perfectly content to fade into the background as much as possible			1
there were plenty of other women in the @entity8 camp – girlfriend @entity63 , mother @entity64 and grandma @entity65 in the @entity66 – to share the limelight , too			1
@entity8 said : ‘ i have felt pretty calm the last 10 days or so			2
whether that ’s to do with @entity1 or not , i ’m not 100 per cent sure			2
but i ’ve enjoyed all of the practices			0
‘ she ’s a very calm person , the way she speaks and the way she explains things			0
it ’s been good so far			0
calming influence : @entity8 has noted how relaxed he has been since working with @entity1 mum 's the word : @entity1 greets @entity8 's mother @entity64 before the opening game the other woman in his life : @entity8 's girlfriend @entity82 was also in attendance at @entity84 ‘ one of the things she said was she tried to take in the atmosphere and the experience of walking out on the court as the defending champion			1
you never know if you ’ll get the chance to do it again			0
‘ she has quite clear memories of doing that herself and so that was one of the things she told me to try and do			0
’ @entity1 ’s calm demeanour will be crucial to the success of her relationship with @entity8			1
the @entity52 likened his younger self to @entity101 yesterday in discussing his guest editorship of ‘ @entity103 ’ , and @entity8 ’s mother , @entity64 , has said he wanted a coach ‘ who would really listen ’			1
@entity1 certainly played that role yesterday			0
she leant forward and watched more intently when @entity8 began chuntering to himself and acknowledging @entity109 ’s backhand winners down the line , and politely applauded as her charge ticked off his service games with impressive ruthlessness and fluency			1
light work : @entity8 defeated @entity109 in straight sets to get his @entity39 defence underway girl power : @entity8 and @entity1 take part in a practice session ahead of the game it is tired and lazy to suggest @entity1 ’s calmness is automatically a female quality , when it is probably more to do with her upbringing and personality than her gender			1
i happened to sit next to her during one of @entity131 ’s early - round matches last year and her demeanour barely changed while her fellow @entity14 endured her typical peaks and troughs of high emotion			0
@entity131 looked towards @entity1 constantly for support , whereas @entity8 is much more his own man			2
that trust between coach and player , though , will take time to build , and yesterday @entity1 seemed to be very clear on one thing : this was @entity8 ’s day in the sun.			1

@entity1 returned to @entity7 as @entity8 's coach
*frenchwomen* won the @entity39 *ladies* singles title in 2006
@entity8 defeated @entity109 in the first round after getting standing ovation
@entity154 has commented how he feels more relaxed working with @entity1
@entity8 's mother @entity64 and girlfriend @entity82 were also watching
