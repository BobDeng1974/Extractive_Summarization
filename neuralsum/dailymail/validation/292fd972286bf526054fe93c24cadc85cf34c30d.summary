police officers in @entity1 have been photographed picking up a @entity3 takeaway after parking their marked squad car at a bus stop			1
a pedestrian walking down @entity7 in the north of the city spotted the car blocking the bus stop late last week			1
one police officer remained in the car while their colleague went into the popular @entity3 to collect their dinner			1
a police officer went into the @entity3 restaurant while their colleague blocked a bus stop in @entity1 the front wheels of the squad car were inside the bus stop for several minutes while the food was prepared the officer returned to the squad car with the food before they departed the scene according to one eyewitness the police car remained outside the takeaway for several minutes until the second over left carrying a carrier bag containing their food			1
the witness , who does not want to be named , told @entity38 : ' they were parked at the bus stop			1
i went up and asked them whether they were allowed to park there			0
it was n't as if they were on an emergency call , or the takeaway was being robbed			0
' they were in getting their dinner			0
i have no problems with police going to a takeaway , but they should obey the same rules as the rest of us			2
' the witness said the officers seemed quite annoyed when he approached			2
' they did not like the fact that i was taking photographs			0
how can the police discipline the public if they do not obey the rules themselves			2
they could have easily found a designated parking space just a few yards away			0
' the police car was pictured outside the @entity70 @entity3 takeaway in @entity1 late last week the witness said he has spotted a number of police cars apparently ignoring road traffic rules across the wider @entity1 area			1
' if the police are dealing with a genuine emergency or need to park illegally for operational issues then that is fine			0
i do n't think that we should hold the police to a higher standard than the rest of us			0
but if i parked on a yellow line or blocked a bus lane , i am sure the traffic warden would be writing a ticket within seconds			1
' @entity90 confirmed that they are looking into the matter			2
a spokesperson said : ' without further information , we are unable to establish the exact reason why the officers pictured have stopped , as they could have been responding to operational incidents or making enquiries			0
this has been passed to supervisors to try and identify the officers involved			0
' where officers are dealing with a police incident they are allowed to contravene traffic regulations , nevertheless where no legitimate policing purpose exists we will always take disciplinary action against the officers involved			1
