by @entity0 published : 06:47 est , 8 october 2013 updated : 07:12 est , 8 october 2013 a four - year - old boy suffers from a rare condition that means a scrape or an argument could kill him , his parents say			2
four - year - old @entity8 has adrenal insufficiency which means he can not naturally deal with physical or emotional setbacks			1
the youngster ’s body does not produce the stress hormone cortisol , and so his body will begin to shut down if he is not administered a life - saving injection within 30 minutes of any stressful event			1
@entity8 , four , has adrenal insufficiency which means his body does n't produce the stress hormone cortisol			1
as a result , without a life - saving cortisol injection after stressful events , his body would shut down after @entity8 started school in @entity24 his mother , @entity22 , 39 , said : ‘ every day i watch the clock , waiting for him to come home			1
‘ i miss him and it ’s hard because i worry about anything happening			0
‘ he should be my responsibility , but i have to let him be a normal little boy and go to school			0
’ @entity8 was diagnosed with the condition after being born by emergency caesarean at 28 weeks , weighing just 1lb 8oz			1
@entity8 ( pictured with his mother , @entity34 ) was born at 28 weeks weighing just 1lb 8oz			1
when he was a week old he developed an infection and his parents were told he would not survive @entity8 ( pictured with his mother , @entity34 , father , @entity38 , sister @entity39 , 14 , and brother , @entity41 , 18 - months ) also has growth problems , chronic lung disease , a heart defect and behavioural problems when he was a week old , he contracted an infection in his bowel and @entity34 , and his father @entity38 , were told to expect the worse by doctors who said he was not strong enough to survive			1
the adrenal glands , which are found at the top of the kidneys , produce steroid hormones that are essential for life - cortisol and aldosterone			1
cortisol mobilises nutrients , enables the body to fight inflammation , stimulates the liver to produce blood sugar and helps control the amount of water in the body			1
adrenal insufficiency is caused by the failure of the adrenal glands to produce sufficient ( or any ) cortisol			1
a prolonged lack of the hormone causes severe fatigue , depression , loss of appetite and weight loss			2
cortisol is particularly important when the body is subjected to stress , such as surgery , trauma or a serious infection			1
if the adrenal glands do not produce cortisol , the body might not be able to cope with this kind of major stress			1
this causes a life - threatening condition called adrenal crisis which causes symptoms including low blood pressure , stomach pain , nausea and fever			2
there are a number of potential causes for adrenal insufficiency including an infection , an autoimmune disease and pituitary gland tumours			1
ms @entity22 , a mother - of - five , said : ‘ we knew we were having a small baby , but we did n’t know there was anything medically wrong with @entity8 until he was born			2
‘ they sent us home for the night to be with our other children and said they would call as soon as he started to deteriorate			0
‘ it was so upsetting to be told our baby was n’t going to last the night			0
‘ we had only had him a week and i had n’t even been able to give him a cuddle			0
’ but amazingly , the call never came and the couple returned to the hospital the following morning to learn that their little boy was pulling through			0
‘ it was a massive turning point for @entity8 , ’ ms @entity22 said			2
however , @entity8 has be left with adrenal insufficiency which makes him vulnerable to physical and mental stress			1
other symptoms of the condition include fatigue and muscle weakness , dizziness , nausea , loss of appetite and stomach ache			0
mr @entity8 , a 37 - year - old engineer , said : ‘ if you or i fall over , our body will deal with the stress of that situation , but @entity8 ’s body ca n’t do that			1
‘ even if he had an argument with someone , he would n’t be able to sit down and calm himself down			0
he ’s just not capable			0
‘ any kind of shock to the system , physically or emotionally , means he needs a cortisol injection as his body wo n’t naturally release it			1
@entity8 has just started school but because of his condition is can not play with the other children in the playground in case he becomes stressed @entity8 ( pictured at school with @entity149 , four ) is still small for his age and his parents do not know what the future holds for him ‘ if he does n’t get the injection , his body will start to shut down and he becomes clammy , lethargic and run down and he would eventually die			1
‘ we have to take his kit wherever we go as just a trip to the park or the shops can be dangerous			0
’ ms @entity22 has stayed at home to look after @entity8 , who also has growth problems , chronic lung disease , a heart defect and behavioural problems			1
ms @entity22 said : ' we knew we were having a small baby , but we did n't know there was anything medically wrong with @entity8 until he was born			1

‘ he knows all about his condition and he knows what the injections are for			0
‘ he ’s aware that he has to be cautious and knows he ’s not allowed to play contact sports			0
we have had to drill it into him			0

‘ but i ca n’t help but worry that everything will be ok as he has complex medical needs , just like any parent would			0
ms @entity22 said : ' he 's very happy and incredibly cheeky , and although he 's got this illness we just have to deal with it			2
