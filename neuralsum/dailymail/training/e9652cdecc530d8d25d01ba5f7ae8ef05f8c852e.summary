@entity0 got off to a winning start in their @entity3 opener against @entity4 at @entity5			1
their 3 - 1 win sets them up perfectly ahead of the tournament they are favourites for , but were they as up to scratch as the scoreline suggests ? @entity13 gives his ratings			1
star : @entity16 shined for @entity0 as they beat @entity4 in their opening @entity3 game @entity0 ( 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 ) @entity19 : 6 did n’t have an enormous amount to do , which is probably the way @entity21 likes it for his @entity24 goalkeeper			1
@entity25 : 5.5 the @entity27 full - back looked distinctly out - of - sorts at times			2
a nervous start to say the least			2
@entity30 : 6 decent in possession , passing the ball more than any other player in that frantic first half			0
@entity35 : 6 a solid , composed start from the @entity38 defender			2
but at times he @entity30 looked stretched			0
@entity39 : 5.5 horrible start and the ignominy of becoming the first @entity42 to score an own goal in a @entity3			0
frustration : @entity39 recovered well after a horrible start with an own goal @entity46 : 6 some surging runs from midfield and a couple of decent shots			0
tried to make things happen			0
@entity52 : 7.5 beat two men before providing the ball from which @entity16 scored			1
showed lots of ambition even if he did lose the ball too easily at times			0
fine performance crowned by the goal of the night to cap @entity0 's victory late on			1
@entity0 : beat two men before providing the ball from which @entity16 scored , and showed ambition			1
@entity64 : 7 @entity0 ’s midfield enforcer struggled to contain @entity66 at times but passed the ball well			1
@entity69 : 6 his partnership with @entity16 is supposed to be key to @entity0 ’s success but had a relatively quiet game			1
@entity16 : 8 flashes of brilliance and a goal that sent this stadium into ecstasy			1
a foolish booking for a clash with @entity82 aside , he carried the hopes of a nation well			0
@entity85 : 6.5 the one member of @entity0 ’s starting line - up who plays his football in @entity89 competed well as their centre forward			1
winner : @entity16 scores the winning goal from the penalty spot against @entity4 at the @entity5 @entity4 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity95 : 5 brilliant save to deny @entity52 in the first half but might have been frustrated to concede to @entity16 given the pace of the shot			1
got a strong hand to @entity16 's penalty but will be disappointed to concede @entity52 's long - range shot late on			1
angry : @entity95 reacts after allowing a goal from the penalty spot against @entity16 which he could have saved @entity104 : 6.5 @entity4 ’s captain often had to cope with the pressure of marking @entity16			1
but kept @entity69 quiet when he popped up on that flank			0
@entity109 : 7 a solid display from @entity4 ’s centre - half , his job often to keep @entity85 quiet			1
he did it pretty well			0
@entity115 : 6.5 like his fellow centre - half , the @entity117 man stood up well against @entity42 pressure			0
@entity120 : 6 had his work cut out when @entity52 was running at him			2
a tough night for the @entity4 full - back			1
@entity82 : 7 some electric running from midfield and some super passing and movement			0
bright spark : @entity82 had some electric running from midfielder and showed superb passing and movement @entity134 : 7 a cynical foul on @entity16 but battled well alongside @entity82 in that midfield battle zone			2
@entity138 : 6.5 terrific cross should have led to an early goal for @entity4			2
certainly kept @entity39 busy and full of running			0
battle : @entity142 ( left ) and his terrific cross should have led to an early goal for @entity4 but he kept @entity39 ( right ) busy @entity145 : 6 chief supplier to @entity147 often had to deal with the close attention of @entity64			2
@entity149 : 6 bad miss in the seventh miss after super cross from @entity142			0
but provided the teasing cross that led to @entity39 ’s own goal			0
allowed @entity25 too much space though			0
@entity156 : 6 probably should have done better with the finish that ended up bouncing in off @entity39 but battled well as the lone striker			0
@entity159 : @entity147 probably should have done better with the finish that ended up bouncing in off @entity39 but battled well man of the match : @entity16			2
referee : @entity164 ( @entity165 ) : 4 two shocking decisions that had an impact on the game			0
wrong over the penalty when @entity170 fouled @entity85 and soft on the foul on @entity19 that denied @entity4 a goal late on			2
man of the match : @entity16 was outstanding for @entity0 in their 3 - 1 win			1

@entity0 beat @entity4 3 - 1 thanks to two goals from @entity16 and one from @entity52 in the 91st minute
it gets the hosts off to perfect start in @entity185
