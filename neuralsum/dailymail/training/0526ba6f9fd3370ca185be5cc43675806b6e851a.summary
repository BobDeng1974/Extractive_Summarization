by @entity1 reporter published : 07:37 est , 5 december 2012 updated : 09:16 est , 5 december 2012 never has there been a more legitimate reason to ask ' is it a bird , is it a plane ? ' amateur photographer @entity7 captured this amazing photo of a seagull crossing the path of an aircraft 's vapour stream on sunday			1
he could not believe his luck when he looked back at his snaps to see how perfectly the jet 's path had dovetailed with the bird 's position in the sky - creating the appearance of a ' super bird '			2
the photos were taken in @entity23 by the @entity24 using a @entity26 k - @entity25 perfect shot : amateur photographer @entity7 took this amazing picture of a seagull in @entity23 over the weekend			1
mr @entity7 , 55 , said he was buzzing when he realised he had taken the perfect image on his first attempt			1
he told @entity32 : ' i am out and about a lot taking photos and i had this picture in my mind about a week ago			2
' we have had a lot of cloud , but one sunny day i saw the contrail and i saw the gull heading towards it , and incredibly i got it on the first shot			2
i expected it to take thousands of shots and i got it just right			0
' i took two shots in succession and and less than a second later it was well away from the contrail			0
â€˜ i was buzzing when i got it			0
it genuinely looks like the vapour is coming from the gull			1
' mr @entity7 , a former care worker , added he was always looking for quirky photo ideas and he hopes to turn his hobby into a profession			1
coincidence : the seagull moments after the first ' perfect ' shot was taken - a long way from the vapour trail vapour trails or contrails are artificial clouds that form behind aircraft			1
they are made of numerous liquid droplets or ice crystals and emerge from the exhaust of aeroplanes			0
it can also be created when areas of low pressure form around the edge of the wing , creating vortices - tubes of circulating air - that leave trails behind the wing 's tips			0
the low pressure in these areas mean that cold air can condense , leaving trails of water or even ice behind the plane			0
when a plane passes through a cloud , water vapour and ice from the clouds are sucked into the vortices , adding to the effect			1
' is it a bird , is it a plane ? ' was a phrase coined in the @entity101 cartoon series			0
the superhero is here depicted by @entity103 in the 1978 film .			0
