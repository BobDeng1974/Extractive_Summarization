detective inspector @entity60 of @entity26 said : ' @entity61 is a person who lived two very different lives			0
' like @entity63 , he is vastly different in moral character depending on the situation , going from caring for and treating children to deliberately targeting , grooming and abusing them			0
' he has admitted a vast number of appalling child sexual abuse offences and the size and the scale of this operation obviously came as a shock to the investigation team when you consider his background allied with the scale of his offending			0
' his profession will obviously be an aggravating factor and one that many people will be extremely concerned about			0
' while i can stress that we found no evidence that he committed any offence during the course of his employment , it will be of absolutely no comfort to the boys and the families of the boys he targeted online			0

' it is so important , in this digital age where even young school children have the internet in the palm of their hand that they know about the dark side of the web			0
' there are dangers lurking if the right precautions are not taken and i would encourage parents to talk to their children and discuss what websites they are visiting , who they are talking to and what to do if approached by someone who asks them to engage in sexual activity			0
