at his lowest point in the 1980s , @entity0 wanted to flee to @entity2 for gender reassignment surgery and return to @entity4 as his children 's @entity5			1
that was around the time his young sons asked their mother why their father had breasts			1
as @entity13 's explosive tell - all with @entity0 came to an end last night , his second wife published a blog detailing their love affair , idyllic marriage and the gender dysphoria revelations that led to their divorce after two sons and a seemingly picture perfect @entity24 life			1
@entity25 , now 64 , met @entity0 at the @entity26 when he was separated from his first wife , @entity27 , the mother of his two eldest children			1
they fell in love and got married in @entity31 when she was already pregnant with their son @entity32			2
a few years later they welcomed a second son together , @entity36			2
they fell in love and got married when she was already pregnant with their first son , @entity32			2
they later had another son as @entity25 wrote on the @entity47 , ' those were the happiest days of my life			2
i had a wonderful husband , who was the most athletic , high - spirited , energetic , easygoing , manly man imaginable			0
i had two beautiful , healthy baby boys			0
i had two great stepchildren			0
life was just about as good as it gets			0
' @entity0 was travelling the world doing paid appearances and lived a glamorous life in @entity24 , frequently seeing his elder son , @entity58 , and daughter , @entity60 , from his first marriage			2
but when @entity36 was 18 months old and @entity32 was three , @entity0 revealed to @entity25 the secret that he finally told the world friday night			1
she was , she insists , blindsided			0
with a ' somber look ' @entity0 told @entity25 - who had braced herself for the revelation of perhaps an affair - that he identified as a woman			1
' what do you mean you identify as a woman ? ' she recalled asking			0
' what does that mean ? and just as he told @entity13 , @entity0 told his wife of four plus years that as long as he could remember , he felt wrong with the reflection staring back at him in the mirror			1
according to @entity25 , her handsome husband told her , ' i have lived in the wrong skin , the wrong body , my whole life			1
it is a living hell for me , and i really feel that i would like to move forward with the process of becoming a woman , the woman i have always been inside			0
' she insists she never saw it coming and there were no signs			0
family : the couple 's youngest son , @entity36 ( left ) , was 18 months old and @entity32 ( right ) was three when @entity0 revealed to @entity25 ( center ) the secret that he finally told the world friday night - that he identified as a woman ' champion ' : on friday , @entity25 , now aged 64 , took to @entity97 to express her support for her former husband unlike @entity0 's third wife @entity101 , who walked in on @entity102 in a dress , @entity25 says there was no evidence he had ever raided her closet or wore any women 's clothes			1
' no. not a clue			0
never , ' she said			0
the couple entered therapy after @entity25 found someone who specialized in gender dysphoria , and the doctor ' broke my heart into a million pieces			2
' she quotes the doctor as telling the couple of the sobering suicide statistics of transgender people at the time - 25 per cent committed suicide - and told @entity25 she could stay with @entity0 as he became a ' she ' or @entity125 could divorce him			1
but she could n't change @entity0			2
while the couple was gutting it out in therapy for six months in a bid to save their marriage , @entity25 writes , @entity0 was struggling			2
according to @entity25 , @entity0 ' considered traveling out of the country , possibly to @entity133 , to have the gender - confirmation surgery and then come back to the @entity4 identifying as female			1
' with four little ones running around under the age of ten , she did n't understand how that would work			0
'' what about the children ? ' he thought maybe he could reenter their lives as ' @entity5			0
'' while she says he referred to himself as @entity5 at the time , he never revealed his female name to @entity13 , referring to that identity as just ' she '			0
as @entity25 writes , she sobbed endlessly and was despondent about the end of her marriage , but as devastated as she was , her ' heart bled for @entity0 '			2
@entity25 decided she did n't want to be married to a woman , their marriage ended , and a few years later , she married music producer @entity154			2
in the years during and after the couple split , @entity0 started taking female hormones			1
he detailed to diane that period in the ' 80s , saying that the hormones quieted and calmed his mind , while his breasts grew to a size 36b during the five years that he was taking them			2
@entity25 remembers the time well , too , and also remembers the lengths he went to in order to change his macho facade			2
tearful : @entity0 revealed that he identifies as a woman in his explosive interview with @entity13 last night transitioning : ' one day , after having spent a little time at @entity0 's house , both boys came into the kitchen and said to me , ' @entity175 , we saw @entity176 getting out of the shower naked , and @entity176 has boobs ! ' writes @entity25 ' thirty years ago the only hair removal that was permanent was electrolysis , ' @entity25 writes			1
' @entity0 began the process of having electrolysis performed on his heavily bearded face			2
he then began having the hair on his chest removed			0
' and she - and their children - could n't miss his newfound bosom			0
@entity25 writes that she had an open door policy for @entity0 to see his children , and he was welcome to visit @entity32 and @entity36 anytime			1
but , and she does n't detail why , the boys never spent the night at @entity0 's house and occasionally visited			1
most likely it was to shield them , as an anecdote about seeing their father undressed led to a lot of confusion			2
' one day , after having spent a little time at @entity0 's house , both boys came into the kitchen and said to me , ' @entity175 , we saw @entity176 getting out of the shower naked , and @entity176 has boobs ! ' and so she tried to cover for @entity0 , their father			1
' well , boys , you know how your dad was super-muscular and trained very hard for the @entity214 ? he had big muscles , and some of those muscles are called ' pectorals			0
' when you stop training and you stop lifting weights , sometimes the muscle turns to fat			0
so his pectoral muscles have probably just gotten a little flabby and look like boobs			0
' soon enough , the exhausting coverup of his transition ended , and it was n't @entity0 's gender dysphoria @entity25 was protecting them from			1
@entity0 stopped taking hormones , did n't go to @entity133 , and started dating again			1
a source told @entity232 he had his breasts reduced			0
according to @entity0 during his @entity235 interview , he chickened out of going through with it and stopped taking the hormones			1
@entity25 then strongly hints that @entity101 knew more about @entity0 's gender identity crisis than @entity0 let on to during the @entity13 interview			1
support : on the @entity13 episode , @entity36 and @entity32 both sit proudly alongside their father , supporting him fully as he enters the next phase of life as ' she '			1
and their mother also wishes @entity0 well @entity25 's second husband @entity154 showed his support for @entity0 after the interview			1
@entity154 was @entity36 and @entity32 's stepfather for 14 years - including the time @entity0 cut the boys off			1
' @entity0 dated several women , even though he had begun his transition and showed signs of it			0
he had no facial hair , no chest hair , and boobs , and he had gotten a nose job and trimmed his adam 's apple			0
' clearly he was still confused and conflicted as to how fully he was ready to commit to changing his life completely			0
' then he married @entity101 and stopped seeing his sons , the sons who 'd seen his breasts , for years			1
' after @entity0 and @entity101 married , there were periods of several years going by without @entity0 attempting to contact or visit his sons			1
no birthday cards or phone calls , no " @entity269 " , no " @entity270 ? " after the big @entity272 earthquake			0
' but , in hindsight , @entity25 believes , the revelation of what her sons ' father was struggling with , and running away from , in the years he vanished from their lives , helps explain a lot			1
on the @entity13 episode , @entity36 and @entity32 both sit proudly with their father , supporting him fully as he enters the next phase of life as ' she '			1
and their mother also wishes him well			0
@entity25 took to @entity97 to support him on friday , hours before the tv show aired , writing : ' once a champion of @entity295 magnitude ... now a champion for those who share the struggle to just be who they are			0
# compassion # acceptance # tolerance # education # evolution # kindness # inclusion			0
' and she ends her blog , ' i can now breathe a little easier , knowing he now has found the strength and the courage to fulfill his dream			0
' @entity25 divorced @entity154 in 2005 .			0
