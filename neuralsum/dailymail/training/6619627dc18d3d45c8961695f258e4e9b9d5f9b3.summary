by @entity0 published : 03:57 est , 2 november 2012 updated : 07:17 est , 2 november 2012 @entity1 fears : vast tracts of the @entity3 have been stripped of edible mushrooms and the @entity5 is blaming ' greedy ' commercial pickers the centuries - old countryside pleasure of foraging for wild mushrooms in the woods has been jeopardised by ‘ greedy ’ commercial pickers , the @entity5 claimed today			1
in the @entity3 , the charity ’s @entity10 has discovered vast tracts of its land have been completely stripped of edible mushrooms			1
the @entity5 says commercial picking on a large scale is ruining a family day out and the professional fungi hunters are also damaging the environment			1
the demand for mushrooms is at a premium after the wettest summer in 100 years left supplies dwindling so professionals are in line for bonanza profits if they can collect enough to sell to top restaurants , hotels and supermarket chains			1
@entity3 is home to thousands of species and is regarded as one of the best areas in the @entity34 for fungi , according to experts			1
trust volunteer @entity37 said : ‘ not only was every single edible mushroom taken or cut , just leaving the stalk , but the ground had been badly trampled			2
‘ taking mushrooms like this stops the fruiting body ’s ability to release its millions of spores each day and the trampling compresses the ground , damaging the places where they like to grow			2
‘ there is also the danger that someone gathering mushrooms in this quantity could take poisonous varieties , with dire consequences for those eating them			2
’ @entity5 is the second largest landowner in the @entity3 , with 5,900 acres on five different sites			1
many mushies : @entity3 is home to thousands of species and is regarded as one of the best areas in the @entity34 for fungi @entity67 , one of the @entity5 ’s outdoor rangers , said : ‘ our commons are there for everybody so we are increasingly saddened that large scale harvesting limits the chance of seeing these lovely mushrooms for regular visitors			1
‘ this sort of plundering is spoiling enjoyment for everyone			0
’ the mushrooms shortage across the @entity34 countryside has meant that professionals are flocking to places like the @entity3 where they can still expect to find enough fungi to make picking commercially worthwhile			1
the amount paid varies from year to year but experts say commercial pickers can expect to pocket at least £ 20 per kilo ( 2.2lbs )			1
licence to pick : the only person allowed to pick mushrooms commercially in @entity3 is @entity91 - @entity90 commercial mushroom picking is banned at the @entity3			1
the only person allowed to pick mushrooms there commercially is @entity90 , 65 , who won a landmark ruling against the @entity96 in 2006			2
a @entity96 spokeswoman said : ‘ people picking mushrooms should only take enough for personal consumption			1
‘ this means no more than 1.5kg ( 3.3lbs ) per visit and no more than half the fruiting bodies of any one species			2
’ ms @entity105 said : ‘ unless we get rain , rain , rain , we are not going to have any mushrooms			2
‘ we need a lot of penetrating rain to rescue the season but i do n’t think we ’re going to get it			0
‘ since i got my licence to pick mushrooms 33 years ago i have never known it so bad			0
‘ the dry , warm spring , wet summer and dry autumn have meant a lack of mushrooms and we have had three ground frosts which has n’t helped			0
‘ usually at this time of year everything would be growing but there is just one here , one there			0
' we had no @entity127 ’s mushrooms at all earlier in the year and the strange seasons have continued			0
‘ @entity129 , hedgehog mushrooms and horn of plenty are all missing			0
‘ the places i supply to are not getting any locally grown ones and the imported mushrooms are also coming in at different times of the year			0
’ prices in the shops are soaring because even imports have been hit by this year 's unusual weather and mushrooms all over the world growing at the ‘ wrong ’ time of year			2
@entity5 says the latest wide scale blitz by professional pickers in the @entity3 saw the area around @entity146 cleared of its mushrooms			1
shop prices soar : with the mushroom shortage , and even imports hit by this year 's unusual weather , commercial pickers can expect to pocket at least £ 20 per kilo ( 2.2lbs ) , experts say @entity154 , a field mycologist who wrote celebrity chef @entity157 ’s @entity156 book on mushrooms , said the problem was with quantity			1
he said : ‘ there has been a lot of variety , but the quantity has been poor			0
the problem is that all the rain came in blocks and although the summer rain was good , there was a six or seven week period this autumn without any rain			0
‘ the mycelium , the long strands that grow underground , need the rain but fungi do not need to produce mushrooms to survive			0
‘ like an apple tree does n’t need to produce apples , fungi do n’t need to produce mushrooms and this year they have n’t			0
‘ last year was excellent so the fungi might also have used up their resources			0
the commercial pickers will certainly be struggling			1
’ the shortage of mushrooms across the @entity34 countryside have meant that professionals are flocking to places like the @entity3 ( pictured ) where they can still expect to find enough fungi to make picking commercially worthwhile @entity187 , from the @entity186 , agreed that it was a poor season , but said interest remained high among amateur enthusiasts			1
he said : ‘ it has been poor so far but there are signs that it is picking up			0
however , some varieties have been very thin on the ground			0
‘ @entity5 is running a survey to log the number of wax cap mushrooms and we have n’t seen many of those about but interest in mycology seems to be growing and for our fungi forays numbers are well up on last year			0

commercial pickers are in line for *massive* profits if they can collect enough mushrooms to sell to supermarkets and shops because of the shortage
commercial pickers can expect to pocket at least £ 20 per kilo ( 2.2lbs )
