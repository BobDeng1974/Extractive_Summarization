after six years of trying for a baby and two failed rounds of @entity3 , @entity0 thought she had run out of options			1
a further problem was that the 32 - year - old has cystic fibrosis , which can make conception difficult			1
so she was astonished when , following a conversation after a family wedding , the sister - in - law she barely knew offered to become a surrogate for her and husband @entity13			1
@entity0 , left , was trying desperately to have a baby when her sister - in - law , who lived in the @entity16 , @entity17 , right , offered to act as a surrogate leading to the successful delivery of @entity20 , centre @entity0 , second left , is married to @entity13 , whose brother @entity23 , right , suggested that his wife @entity17 , second right , would be willing to carry their baby @entity20 , as they already had @entity29 , centre @entity31 , left , and his wife @entity0 , right , tried unsuccessfully for six years to have a baby , including @entity3 even then there were obstacles – her sister - in - law lived in @entity36 and so @entity0 ’s frozen embryos had to be sent across the @entity38 to the @entity16			1
but all went well and @entity0 and @entity13 now have a healthy son , @entity20			1
@entity0 said she was ‘ beyond amazed ’ when @entity41 , who is married to @entity13 ’s brother @entity23 , offered surrogacy as a solution			1
‘ we had tried all we could and it was n’t going to work out , ’ @entity0 said			2
‘ but for all the doors that closed a window had just opened and it just felt like it was meant to be			0
it was such a relief after so many years of hitting stumbling blocks			0
‘ i did n’t know @entity17 that well			2
i was n’t particularly close with her because we had n’t spent much time together			0
we certainly were n’t close enough to expect such an amazing offer to be made			0
‘ even then , you ca n’t help but think , “ can we deal with all the things we need to deal with to make this happen ? ” there are lots of costs and legal issues with a surrogacy			0
’ after getting approval from their doctors , they went ahead and @entity20 was born in june			1
@entity0 , who is originally from @entity65 and is a volunteer fundraiser for the @entity67 , met entrepreneur @entity13 , 34 , while attending a university summer school in @entity70			1
the couple married in april 2005 and began trying for a baby late in 2006			0
after 18 months without success they were referred for fertility treatment , but @entity0 struggled to complete courses of medication because of bouts of ill health			2
eventually , in 2012 , she received two rounds of @entity84 - funded ivf treatment , both of which failed because of what doctors suspected was a problem with her womb lining			1
the couple ’s @entity84 funding had run out and they felt there were no more options open to them			2
they had met @entity17 , 34 , only a few times because she and @entity23 , 30 , lived in her native @entity36 with daughter @entity29 , four			1
after doctors agreed to the plan , @entity0 and @entity13 , right , sent their embryos to the @entity16 to be implanted @entity17 and @entity23 , right , with daughter @entity29 , moved to @entity70 when @entity17 fell pregnant so @entity0 , second left , could attend all the pre-natal scans until @entity20 was born in june last year weighing 7lb 13oz @entity0 , left , was unable to fall pregnant herself because she has cystic fibrosis , pictured with son @entity20 but when @entity0 talked of her worries about conceiving to her following a family wedding in @entity104 in july 2012 , she made a serious offer to be their surrogate			1
a year later , two rounds of frozen embryos were shipped to the @entity16			1
the first , in august 2013 , failed but the second , in october , was successful			0
@entity0 said : ‘ they held up the positive test on @entity112 and told us it was a yes			2
i took such a deep breath because of the shock i started coughing really badly			0
when you hear “ no , no , no ” for so long you do n’t know how to handle it when it is finally a “ yes ”			0
’ @entity17 and @entity23 moved to @entity70 and @entity0 attended all the scans and appointments			1
she said : ‘ i can not speak highly enough about @entity17 and how she made me feel during the pregnancy			2
i did worry if i was going to be too jealous that it was her and not me that was pregnant , but she did the very best job that was possible to make it feel ours			0
’ @entity20 was born by planned caesarean section weighing a healthy 7lb 13oz and was given @entity17 ’s maiden name @entity131 as a middle name in her honour			1
@entity0 said : ‘ there he finally was , after all the effort and the hard work and the waiting and the tears			2
i got the first cuddle , which was just amazing			0
‘ there ’s nobody higher in my books than @entity17			0
what can you say about somebody who gives you the ultimate gift ? ’ @entity17 said : ‘ i could see how much she wanted her own child			0
it felt like the right thing to do			0
‘ [ @entity23 and @entity150 ] wanted @entity29 to have a playmate but , at the same time , we ’d decided not to have any more children			1
so giving @entity29 a cousin was the perfect solution			0
’ @entity13 said : ‘ it ’s amazing being a dad , i love it , and we ca n’t thank @entity17 enough			2
