by @entity0 published : 02:53 est , 4 may 2012 updated : 04:51 est , 4 may 2012 @entity3 firms have a ' responsibility ' to employ more ex-offenders who can be motivated and honest , the justice secretary has said			1
@entity6 urged businesses , including household names such as @entity9 and @entity10 , to hire former prisoners without fear of damaging their reputation or values			1
mr @entity6 is trying to convince companies to fulfill their ' social responsibility ' ahead of @entity18 summit , later this month , where up to 40 companies hear him outline how prisoners can make loyal and committed employees if given the right opportunities upon release from jail			1
opportunity : justice secretary @entity6 , right , seen here talking to prisoners during a visit to @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity28 , has said ex offenders can be motivated and honest workers if given a chance the government has insisted the scheme is aimed at cutting reoffending rate – which currently sees 47per cent of adult offenders commit another crime within a year			1
but mr @entity6 there is ‘ no reason ’ why profits from prisoners ' work should not be used to pay for the prisons that house them			1
he admitted that when he was home secretary 20 years ago it was difficult to persuade firms that hiring ex-prisoners ‘ could be aligned with the sensible management of a thriving business ’			1
‘ actually it makes very great sense , ’ he said			0
‘ you will be able to recruit and train people who will be highly motivated individuals when they 've taken advantage of the opportunities this kind of thing can present them			0
‘ we have large numbers of major companies expressing a strong interest , beginning to get organised , @entity9 , @entity10			0
’ obligation : companies have a social responsibility to help ex offenders stay out of trouble when they have been release , according to justice secretary @entity6 he added : ‘ introducing work experience and training to people who are serving their time and being punished in prison is altogether a more intelligent way of running the prison service			1
’ ‘ there is no doubt that people who get sent to prison have made a mistake , society is entitled to look for them to be punished , but also society should be trying to do something to help those who have the gumption to sort themselves out , to resume an ordinary honest life as decent citizens when they leave			0
‘ if you just incarcerate people , if prison is just a warehouse in which you keep people and then release them without guidance into the world , it 's hardly surprising that half of them will be back within 12 months , having committed more crime			1
‘ many prisoners do not want to be part of that cycle			1
we need to facilitate the way in which people get back into a normal life and do not commit further crimes again			1
’ he went on : ‘ we also stress to the businessmen that you can take part in this and derive benefits as a business and you do n't have to compromise your ordinary standards of commercial judgment			0
‘ i want eventually to see businesses manufacturing , providing services , from prisons on a commercial basis			0
‘ there 's no reason why they should n't help pay for themselves and the cost of the prison			0
’ the government is working with the @entity124 to ensure that measures are put in place to guard against unfair competition with ordinary businesses outside the prison gates , he added			0
speaking ahead of the launch of @entity131 , which will replace the @entity133 unit in helping prisoners to improve their job prospects , mr @entity6 said there were 131 prisons across @entity138 and @entity139 where there was the space for some sort of training and work - related experience			1
‘ some of that will be organised by what was our @entity133 but more and more of it ( will be ) normal household name firms actually doing it as part of their social responsibility and the running of their business			1
’ @entity9 and @entity10 are just two of the major firms interested after @entity157 opened its first training academy at a jail four years ago , mr @entity6 said			2
prisons minister @entity160 added : ‘ we 're trying to get towards a place where instead of work being part of the prison estate where it can be squeezed in among the security requirement , we will have work central to prison , and change the way we build security around that work			0
’ a @entity173 spokesman said : ‘ we believe the more productive people can be while they are in prison , the more they can develop their skills and the better their chances of rehabilitation and of succeeding and not reoffending on release			2
‘ everyone deserves a second chance and research shows that many ex-offenders are more committed and willing to do more than ' just the job ' and are grateful for the opportunity to do something worthwhile			0
’ he said it was ‘ still relatively early days across the group ’ , but added : ‘ sir @entity189 believes this is the right thing to do			0
’ old habits : currently 47per cent of jailed adult offenders commit another crime within 12 months the group 's non-profit foundation @entity199 was ‘ looking at how to increase the work opportunities in prisons , prior to and at the time of release ’ , the spokesman added			1
@entity201 , director of the @entity202 , said : ‘ firms should follow the lead set by @entity205 and @entity157 who not only employ former offenders in prisons but have built up a loyal and skilled workforce by doing so			2
’ a @entity10 spokeswoman said the firm does not have a formal programme which targets ex-offenders but they can be referred to its @entity215 scheme , which aims to support people who face barriers getting into work			1
former prisoner @entity219 , editor of the prisoners ' newspaper @entity220 , said mr @entity6 's rhetoric ‘ is n't enough ’			2
‘ simply telling employers to hire ex-offenders wo n't surmount their ingrained reluctance to do so - if @entity6 is serious about this , he needs to provide incentives to employers , such as reduced employer 's national insurance contributions for ex-offenders , to encourage the hiring of them , ’ he said			0
‘ to me , it seems @entity6 just does n't get it , he does n't understand that in order to translate theory into practice , rhetoric is n't enough - ex-offenders have paid the price for what they did , and employers should be encouraged to employ them with practical employment benefits			0
’ @entity157 said any prisoners it employed who were eligible for paid work earned the national minimum wage , currently £ 6.08 per hour for those aged 21 and over , with bonuses if they achieve a particular skill level			2
inmates who were not eligible for paid work receive the weekly prison wage			0
the average rate of pay for inmates working inside prisons was £ 9.60 per week in 2007 , figures in the @entity202 's latest @entity259 factfile showed			2
it added that in 2007/08 prisoners spent an average of 12.6 hours a week working .			2

scheme aims to cut *re-offending* rate which currently sees nearly half of adult prisoners commit another crime within a year of release
