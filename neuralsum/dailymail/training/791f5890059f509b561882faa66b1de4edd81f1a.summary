the ' @entity4 ' does not require scissors or @entity6 , and nor does it involve the user having to make fiddly folds in the ends			1
users simply roll it out , place the gift in the middle of it , tear off a strip and twist it around the present to secure it in place			1
@entity16 has created ' @entity4 ' to help men who struggle to wrap presents neatly			1
it does not require scissors , @entity6 or any fiddly folding it was created by designer @entity16 , who noticed the sheer number of men who found the wrapping process so difficult that some even resorted to using bin liners			1
he came up with the ' @entity4 ' as a solution			0
the tube of decorative paper provides 16ft of gift - wrap with a width of 8ins to coat small presents such as boxes and bottles			2
mr @entity16 , 39 , from @entity35 , south @entity36 , said : ‘ generally , there have always been men moaning about wrapping up presents and women who are more particular about it			2
‘ my brother actually wrapped my stuff up one year in bin bags and i have heard of other men using kitchen tin foil			0
‘ i wanted to make something you could quickly wrap and look nice , so i started trying to find a way to make it easier			0
i initially looked at cling film but it would n't work			0
‘ we settled on using a tin foil style and selected a certain thickness and type before deciding on the blue and silver stars theme			0
users simply roll it out , place the gift in the middle of it , tear off a strip and twist it around the present to secure it in place mr @entity16 says he created the paper because he noticed the sheer number of men who found the wrapping process so difficult that some even resorted to using bin liners ‘ i took it to a trade show and women were saying “ even a bloke could use this ” which helped it get the name			1
‘ it has instructions on the back of the packaging to show people how to use it , but you simply have to rip it and wrap it			0
‘ it 's a bit like @entity94 , people really like it or they do n't , but we have had some great feedback			0

@entity16 has created ' @entity4 ' to help men who struggle to wrap gifts
