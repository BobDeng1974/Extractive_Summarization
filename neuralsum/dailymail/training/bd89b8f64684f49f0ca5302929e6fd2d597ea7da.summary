an @entity1 chief has said alcohol is becoming a ' silent killer ' in the @entity4 as he warned middle class drinkers that a glass of wine is just as harmful as downing three shots of vodka			1
@entity10 , the head of @entity11 , said deaths from alcohol - related illnesses had soared by 500 per cent since the seventies to become the third biggest killer of working age people in the @entity4			1
@entity4 is now the only country in western @entity17 except @entity18 where cases of liver disease are increasing			2
mr @entity10 added that the middle classes would often pour themselves a glass of wine at the end of the day with ' no idea ' how much they were actually drinking			0
last week the @entity39 commission said @entity4 is turning into the capital of @entity17 for alcohol - related disease as they recommended that liver scans should be offered by @entity43			1
in his weekly staff briefing , mr @entity10 said liver disease is largely preventable but was a ' silent killer with 75 per cent of people with cirrhosis only being diagnosed once they are admitted to hospital			2
' liver disease is largely preventable with the three big risk factors being alcohol – for example , a large glass of wine is like three shots of vodka , so it is very easy for people to pour a glass and have no idea how much they are drinking			1
' @entity63 , the @entity64 mp , agreed , telling the @entity65 : ' this is an issue we need to take much more seriously , and revise our view of the binge drinker as a teenager out late at night			0
a glass of wine after work does the same harm as drinking three shots of vodka ( coloured vodka shots pictured ) @entity10 , the head of @entity11 , has warned ' increasingly too high levels of alcohol consumption are occurring in the home by older age groups and we all have a responsibility to challenge and help address this			2
' as liver disease cases increase , a treatment that reduces the urge for alcohol was made available last month to those who regularly consume more than 7.5 units every day @entity90 costs £ 3 and is suitable for anyone who drinks half a bottle of wine or three pints each day it was rolled out in @entity95 last october , where so far 53 people have used it @entity99 mp @entity98 , chair of the all @entity100 , said drinkers would be safer to enjoy their favourite tipple in the local pub which had a ' legal responsibility ' to give controlled measures and not allow punters to get too drunk			0
@entity107 , the former chair of the alcohol misuse group , and conservative mp she was ' really pleased ' the issue had been raised by @entity11 to try and encourage people to change their drinking habits			0
' people will see it is a very different thing pouring a glass of wine to pouring a three measure vodka but this is why it important to have calorific content on the labels - you would n't pour three shots of vodka but you also would n't sit down and eat six donuts - but you tend to pour yourself a large measure of wine not a small glass			0
