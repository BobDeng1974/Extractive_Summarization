by @entity0 published : 20:51 est , 17 march 2014 updated : 05:51 est , 18 march 2014 here ’s a funny thing , though it might not make you laugh			1
@entity4 , the show i created and co-wrote with @entity6 , is repeated every saturday and gets audiences of 2.2 million			1
but my favourite sitcom of all , the one that recaptures the most extraordinary era of my life , will never be screened again			1
classic : the @entity14 cast with @entity15 in make - up as @entity17 , centre front @entity14 has been deemed by the @entity19 too politically incorrect and even racist to be repeated			1
i believe it ’s equally as funny as @entity4 , and full of characters just as memorable — the blustering sergeant - major , the camp drag artiste and the @entity24 orderly who was more @entity26 than the @entity27			1
the comedy — about a @entity30 concert party stationed in @entity24 in the last months of @entity31 — was ribald and often farcical , but anyone who has served in the @entity33 knows that is exactly what it ’s like			1
like all the shows @entity6 and i wrote together — including @entity38 ! , set in a @entity40 holiday camp , and the upstairs downstairs comedy @entity42 , @entity43 ? — this was deeply rooted in reality			1
and that ’s the problem			1
too many executives at the @entity19 have rather too little idea what reality looks like			1
they are @entity50 graduates trained by other @entity50 graduates who learnt what they know from still more @entity50 graduates			1
the real world does n’t get a look - in at today ’s @entity19			1
i ’m 90 and my generation , by contrast , had about as much reality as anyone could wish for			1
during @entity31 , i joined the @entity61 : it was 1941 and i was the 16 - year - old original of @entity62			1
two years later , i was conscripted into the @entity30 as a gunner			1
in 1944 , i was sent to @entity65 , where i spent four months manning a gun battery , before i was sent to @entity67 , near @entity68 , and joined the concert party			1
we did n’t call it @entity67 in those days — it was @entity73 ! like the characters in our sitcom , i was a gunner , and the standing joke was that maybe one day we were ‘ gunner get home ’			1
they did n’t tell us until the war was over that there was no chance of that happening any time soon : with millions of troops in @entity24 and south - east @entity85 , and only a small fleet of troopships , getting back to @entity88 was a long , slow business			1
@entity0 ( right ) created @entity4 with @entity6 ( left ) but his other comedy was his real hit , he says @entity6 and @entity93 wrote that into one episode			1
when the colonel tells the gang show performers that @entity97 has surrendered , @entity98 — the mincing little star of the show , played by @entity101 — trots off the parade ground to pack a suitcase			2
the sergeant - major is apoplectic			2
‘ where do you think you ’re going ? ’ he bellows			2
a simple line , and it got one of the biggest laughs i ’ve ever heard from a studio audience			2
@entity6 and i did n’t write jokes , we wrote situations , so the comedy required great actors — and we had one in @entity118 , with his bulging eyes , needletip moustaches and booming @entity122 roar			2
the conscripts did think they were going home , and the sergeant - majors knew only too well that , when the men were demobbed , their empires would be over			2
another empire ended at the same time , of course — @entity26 ’s			2
i was in @entity24 during the switch to independence , and for a lad from @entity134 in @entity135 it was a strange experience			2
but i soaked all of it up , and any writer will tell you that such powerful impressions are bound to fuel your imagination in later life			2
the @entity19 youngsters ca n't accept the world was a very different place then			1
to pretend otherwise would be lying			2
the languages , the smells , the great beauty , the immense poverty — the truth is , i was sad to leave			2
we toured for two years , as our signature tune said , ‘ from @entity154 to @entity155 , from @entity156 to @entity68 ... and if you really liked our show , we ’ll come again another day ’			2
we even found ourselves on the north - west frontier , which was ruled by bandit tribes			2
our bearer was always with us , an educated and marvellously efficient man who went to extraordinary lengths for us			2
before an inspection , he would work furiously to make every bit of leather and brass shine , before picking us up and carrying us on his back to the parade ground			0
he did it to keep the dust off us : in that heat the earth was as dry as ash			0
once we were in position , he ’d give our boots one final rub with his cloth			0
it ’s bizarre to look back on that and realise that it once seemed normal — that ’s how the @entity4 worked almost 70 years ago			0
and that ’s what the @entity19 youngsters can not accept			1
the world was a very different place then			1
we ca n’t pretend otherwise			0
it might seem outrageous , even decadent , that a bunch of song - and - dance conscripts had to be carried around a parade ground , but that ’s because we ’re looking back from a 21st - century perspective			0
@entity4 captured life in the army , but @entity24 fascinated @entity0 , and anyone who went there knows @entity14 gets it the bearers saw their duties as deeply honourable , and took pride in performing them to the highest standard			1
when i finally boarded for home in 1946 , my bearer asked me , with a lump in his throat : ‘ can i come home to @entity88 with you , sahib ? ’ his name was @entity213 , and we kept that name for the character who narrated @entity14			1
he always talked of ‘ we @entity26 ’ and he had two lovely catchphrases , when he was berating his juniors , which will be familiar to viewers with long memories — ‘ damn natives ! ’ and ‘ do n’t be such a clever dickie ! ’ when a @entity26 officer corrected him , he would scold himself : ‘ @entity223 , @entity224 ! ’ at the end of every episode , @entity225 delivered some piece of spurious wisdom , with the words : ‘ there is an old @entity233 proverb			0
’ and then he would tell us a bit of nonsense , such as : ‘ when you have cholera and @entity239 belly , it does not stop your house from catching fire			0
’ our lead actor , @entity15 , was born in @entity24 , spoke @entity244 and @entity245			0
he loved @entity24 , and so did i. to play a character who meant so much to me , we needed a special actor			0
and we found one in the great @entity15			0
he was born to @entity26 parents in @entity24 , the son of an @entity255 civil servant			0
he spoke @entity244 and @entity245 fluently , and sometimes he and i would talk in the pidgin urdu that i had picked up in the forces			0
like most children of @entity255 , he ’d had an @entity24 nurse , an ‘ ayah ’ , who taught him the best of her own culture			0
he never lost the ability to squat on his haunches — a great relaxation trick			0
he died tragically young of cancer in 1978 , aged 57			0
@entity15 loved @entity24 , and so did i. that shines through in every episode of @entity14 , and we made nearly 60			1
but because he is a white man wearing a turban and playing a native @entity24 , we are accused of racism			0
people claim @entity15 was ‘ blacking up ’ , which is simply not true			0
he just needed a little make - up to tan his skin , a trick that every newsreader uses these days			0
we would have been delighted to use @entity24 actors , if we could have found any			0
this was the first @entity19 sitcom even to be set outside @entity26 , and we did not live in a multicultural society in the @entity282 ( the series ran from 1974 to 1981 )			1
it was considered normal for @entity285 or @entity286 to ‘ black up ’ when they played @entity291 — today , that would be wrong , but those were different times			0
we did get an excellent @entity293 actor to play the ‘ char wallah ’ , the boy who brings the tea urn round			0
his name was @entity298 , and if i remember correctly he was working in a restaurant as a waiter when he first auditioned			0
it frustrates me that television today is run by people who do n’t know their history			0
they do n’t want to face the fact that , within my lifetime , @entity26 ruled a third of the world ’s population — so they ignore it			1
it ’s such a waste : vintage comedy is a wonderful tool to help a new generation understand the past			0
many people in the industry will agree with me but ca n’t speak up because they might lose their jobs			0
i have the advantage of being 90 , so i can say what i like			0
it takes courage to face the past and confront sensitive issues			0
sadly , by banning @entity14 from our screens , the @entity19 is taking the cowardly way out .			1

@entity14 deemed politically incorrect by @entity330
@entity0 claims it is an accurate *portrayal* of a *bygone* era
blasts @entity19 ' @entity50 graduates ' for not acknowledging ' real world '
