the primary school teacher lost seven pints of blood , needed 22 transfusions and spent 12 hours in a coma , when her family was told she might not pull through			1
mrs @entity8 , who is married to @entity28 , 33 , said : ‘ i feel so lucky to be here and really blessed that both the girls are with us because it could have been so different			0

a rare condition , which affects only one in 80,000 births , caused mrs @entity8 to suffer severe internal bleeding and her lungs collapsed ‘ knowing that i almost died has changed my perspective on life , i ’m more laid back and i am enjoying being a mum more than ever because i know we were so close to losing so much			1
’ mrs @entity8 , who also has a four - year - old daughter @entity50 with her husband , was admitted to the @entity52 suffering from pre-eclampsia – the potentially fatal condition which causes high blood pressure and swelling in pregnancy			1
doctors decided the babies , now aged eight months , needed to be born before the condition worsened , so mrs @entity8 was induced			1
the labour was progressing normally and mrs @entity8 asked for an epidural			0
but shortly afterwards a midwife became concerned that mrs @entity8 was coughing and struggling for breath			0
medics realised mrs @entity8 ’s lungs were collapsing because she was suffering a rare complication , known as an amniotic fluid embolism , where fluid from the sac surrounding the babies leaks into the mother ’s bloodstream through blood vessels in the womb			1
cells – such as a fingernail or hair – from the unborn children , that were in the fluid , travelled to her lungs , prompting a severe allergic reaction			1
doctors immediately began giving mrs @entity8 oxygen and rushed her to theatre for a caesarean section to try to save the babies			2

’ after successfully delivering the girls , however , medics realised mrs @entity8 was haemorrhaging because her blood had lost the ability to clot			0
she was given 22 blood transfusions and it was n’t until three hours later , at around 2am , that doctors managed to stabilise her			2

she managed to hold the twins for the first time a day later and was well enough to go home the following week			2
the twins spent a fortnight in hospital and have n’t suffered any lasting effects			0
dr @entity114 , the consultant obstetrician who treated mrs @entity8 , said : ‘ amniotic fluid embolism is a unique , catastrophic condition			2
‘ although we know it is more likely to occur in twin pregnancies or women who have their labour induced , they are not the direct cause			0
