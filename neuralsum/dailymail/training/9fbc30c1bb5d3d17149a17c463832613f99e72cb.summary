but @entity4 ’s million - dollar memoir is n’t to everyone ’s taste - the @entity2 family have made it clear that they at least will not be reading it			1
‘ we 're not interested in this book , just like we were n't interested in the others about the case , and we wo n't read it , ' @entity19 ’s sister @entity2 said , after its @entity26 release yesterday			1
she added : ‘ @entity19 is the victim in this tragic case			2
’ @entity28 served four years in an @entity30 jail for the 2007 murder of her @entity33 flatmate @entity19 in @entity34			1
she and former boyfriend @entity35 were freed on appeal in 2011 , but last month @entity30 ’s highest court dramatically ruled the pair must face retrial			0
her memoir waiting to be heard , for which @entity28 was reportedly paid a 2 million pound advance , was published today in the @entity26 although plans to sell it in the @entity33 were shelved after its publisher @entity47 took legal advice			2
while a new trial is expected to take place by the summer in @entity52 , @entity26 authorities could invoke the principle of double - jeopardy , arguing that a person can not be convicted of the same offence twice , and so refuse to extradite @entity28 back to @entity30			1
@entity2 , the sister of the victim , released a statement in @entity30 through the family 's lawyers @entity59 and @entity62 in @entity30 late on tuesday after excerpts of miss @entity4 's first @entity65 interview were released to publicise the release of her book , waiting to be @entity68			1
she also emphasised that miss @entity4 could be found guilty in the new trial			1
she said : ‘ the @entity30 legal system still has an appeal procedure under way and so the case is returning to a new court hearing			0
the sentence can still be overturned			0
‘ i have no doubts that on the other side there is a story of pain and loss and enormous mistrust but in the end it is also one of hope and the opportunity to live life			0
her story : in pre-interviews ahead of the release of ' waiting to be heard ' , @entity4 has said she wants the @entity2 family top read her memoirs killed : @entity28 spent four years in jail for the murder of @entity33 student @entity19 , 21 , in @entity34 , @entity30 , november 2007 ‘ @entity95 will never have and something we can never share with her			1
@entity19 is the victim in this tragic case			2
’ @entity28 had earlier expressed the desire that @entity19 ’s parents would read the book , something she hoped would give her some ‘ closure ’			1
‘ the ideal situation in my mind is that they could show me @entity19 's grave , ' she told @entity109			1
‘ i was n't allowed to grieve , either , and that would mean a lot to me ’			0
‘ i really want to go see her grave , " repeated miss @entity4 , who spent four years in prison before being acquitted			0
' and right now i do n't feel i have the right to without her family 's permission			2
’ @entity28 likened her ordeal to being forced to crawl through a ' field of barbed wire ' to reach the ' same side ' as the @entity125			2
in another interview , she told @entity127 that she wrote the book to respond in full to accusations that meant ‘ for all intents and purposes i was a murderer ’			0
‘ i want the truth to come out			0
i 'd like to be reconsidered as a person , ' she said			0
' i was in the courtroom when they were calling me a devil			0
‘ it 's one thing to be called certain things in the media , but it 's another to be sitting in a courtroom , fighting for your life , while people are calling you a devil			0
