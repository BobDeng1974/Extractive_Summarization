this time 12 months ago @entity0 arrived in @entity1 off the back of a season wrecked by glandular fever and needing to qualify for a place in the opening grand slam of 2014			2
she flew into town on saturday as one of the early form horses of the @entity10 , armed with her second career title of the main circuit and a career - high world ranking			1
the 22 - year - old @entity15 right - hander will be confirmed on monday at @entity16 — one above her career best — courtesy of a 6 - 3 , 6 - 4 victory over @entity21 @entity20 in the final of the @entity23 on saturday			1
a beaming @entity0 celebrates after winning the @entity23 - her second @entity10 title @entity0 celebrates after securing victory and a career - high ranking of @entity27 ahead of the @entity28 the @entity29 plays a forehand during her singles final match against @entity20 of the @entity21 that means a rise of more than 80 places in the past year as , in the prolonged absence of the injured @entity37 , she remains in a league of her own as far as @entity40 ’s women are concerned			1
by adding to the @entity42 event she claimed in late 2012 , she becomes the first @entity44 female to win two events on the main circuit since @entity47 in 1985			1
@entity0 undoubtedly benefited from the prior week of top - class competition representing @entity40 with @entity49 in the @entity52 mixed team event			2
‘ it was a great week in @entity54			0
being there as @entity49 ’s team - mate definitely gave me a boost of confidence , ’ she said			2
‘ i feel like i ’m using everything to play good , positive tennis and i ’m coming out with good results			0
‘ i like to have a title to my name , so i ’m very pleased to get that today			0
’ the @entity29 beat @entity21 's @entity20 6 - 3 6 - 4 in the final in @entity23 during a rain - interrupted match @entity0 needed much of her customary pluck to overcome qualifier @entity20 and collect the £ 28,000 winner ’s cheque and 280 ranking points			1
she faced 12 break points in the first two games and went behind before settling down to master the @entity75 wind better than her opponent			0
while @entity20 , ranked 84 , was not the most terrifying prospect in a @entity10 final at this level , the @entity77 had earned her passage with an eye - catching thrashing earlier in the event of a more celebrated @entity21 , @entity85			1
it is a reminder that her chief virtues of baseline aggression , outstanding athleticism and a strong temperament can carry her considerably higher than her present mark			0
the @entity23 win should lift @entity0 to a career - high ranking of 38 as she heads to @entity94 after a somewhat deflating final third of last season when she struggled to string wins together , @entity0 should be able to push her ranking further , having already banked some decent points early on			1
her opponent in the first round in @entity94 will be the 67th - ranked @entity102 @entity101 , whose main career distinction has been her disproportionate expertise at @entity105 , where she reached the semi-finals in 2010			2
‘ i did n’t look at who i was going to play in @entity94 until i was done in @entity23 because i wanted @entity23 to be my main focus until i was done , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i ’ve played @entity101 now three times			0
we always have really good , competitive , long matches			0
it wo n’t be easy			0
’ in the long run it would doubtless help @entity0 , who spent her teenage years in @entity115 after realising that @entity15 was too remote to seriously hone her tennis skills , if @entity117 can get back to resume their @entity44 rivalry			1
celebrating her 21st birthday next week , this event marks a year since @entity117 last played on the tour before succumbing to a wrist injury that ultimately required an operation			0
while she is back training hard in @entity115 , caution continues to be the watchword with the former junior @entity105 champion			0
@entity0 celebrates with her coach @entity129 after claiming the trophy in @entity23			2

@entity0 beat @entity21 's @entity20 6 - 3 6 - 4 in the final in @entity23
@entity0 reaches a career - high ranking of no 38 ahead of @entity28
she is the first @entity44 female to win two events on the main circuit since @entity47 in 1985 .
