@entity7 , from @entity12 , lost her leg after an accident last summer
she was *overjoyed* when a disabled parking spot was added to her apartment complex 's parking lot last week
a car parked there without a placard so she left a note pointing out the error - and got a scathing note in return , starting : ' @entity153 '
the note told her to go to a ' one leg support group ' if she wanted pity and threatened to call police if she touched the car again
but @entity38 is now the one who has gone to police over the note
