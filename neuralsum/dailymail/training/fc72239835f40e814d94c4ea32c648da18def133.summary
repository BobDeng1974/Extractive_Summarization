by @entity0 royal etiquette may dictate that the @entity2 must behave like a lady , but there 's one thing that really makes @entity2 let her glossy hair down - watching sport			1
and nowhere has this been better demonstrated than at this year 's @entity9 in @entity10			1
@entity2 just could n't suppress those ' ooohs ' and ' ahhhs ' as she watched the athletics from the stands at @entity14 today			1
a sporting girl herself , @entity2 clearly feels rather involved , even as a spectator			2
yesterday , it was the hockey - at which she excelled as a schoolgirl - that elicited her cheers			2
she whooped the wins , punched the air with disappointment at the losses and laughed along with the crowd			0
at one point the @entity2 was poised , thumbs in limbo , waiting to see which way the action would go before giving a big thumbs up to the win			2
@entity49 ! : @entity50 of @entity51 grins ( left ) and makes sure stray hairs do n't ruin her fun ( right ) at another particularly tense moment , she could be seen biting her lip with nerves			0
and prince @entity56 looked equally enthralled , chatting along with his wife and getting involved in the spectator action			1
up they go ! the athletes get a big royal thumbs up from @entity50 oooh - errr ! : the @entity62 are entranced by the action the pair were in @entity10 for the sixth day of action , watching the seven track and field events unfold			2
yesterday , the @entity62 were also in attendance , to watch the hockey			2
@entity50 looked simple and elegant in her trusty wedges , blue skin tight trousers and classic blue blazer			0
@entity2 's feelings were written all over her face as she watched a hockey match between @entity75 and @entity76 pictured with their faces in all manner of contortions they seemed to live and breathe the match from the sidelines			1
at one particularly hair - raising moment , the princess put her hand over her mouth and then covered her eyes			0
@entity88 , who sat beside the couple , was equally enthralled by the action			1
oh no ! the @entity62 ca n't hide their amazement at the hockey action @entity50 of @entity51 watched a @entity94 match between @entity75 and @entity76 at the @entity95 yesterday @entity2 also made an appearance at @entity97 earlier this month			1
the royal couple watched @entity99 and @entity100 battle it out in the final			0
the face said it all as the gripping match unfolded			0
they sat in the @entity106 with @entity35 and @entity107 , as well as a host of @entity110 stars including @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114			0
duchess of @entity51 's parents , @entity123 and @entity124 , her sister @entity115 and her boyfriend @entity117 who were seated in a separate area in the corner of the stands			0
lip - biting stuff : @entity2 watches @entity127 crash out of @entity97 the face says it all : @entity2 finds it hard to hide the tension she 's feeling while watching the @entity133 champ looking optimistic , but defeat is in store for their boy @entity127 earlier in the week , the @entity62 popped into @entity138 to watch @entity127 , but the @entity133 champ ended up losing to @entity139 of @entity140			1
the duchess was so involved in the match , at one point her mouth become totally contorted			0
but the 32 - year - old still managed to look chic wearing a dress by @entity148 designer , @entity147			0
the tension was palpable as @entity2 cheered on the @entity97 finalists happy times : the duchess is incredibly excited by the action @entity154 : @entity50 felt involved it 's a miss ! @entity2 covers her mouth in horror			1

when it comes to sport , @entity2 *abandons* her usual demure *demeanour*
today she watched the athletics at @entity14 in @entity10
yesterday she and @entity56 cheered on the hockey *players*
she appeared equally enthralled at @entity97 earlier this month
