almost half of black males have been arrested by the time they are 23 according to a new study released in the @entity6 journal on monday this is the first report since the 1960s on how the risk of arrest varies across race and gender , said @entity40 , a criminology professor at the @entity41 and lead author of the study			1
the study 's most striking finding is the variance amongst males of different races : nearly 40 percent of white males have been arrested by the time they are 23 , which can have a negative impact on their ability to find work , go to school and participate fully in their communities ‘ a problem is that many males – especially black males – are navigating the transition from youth to adulthood with the baggage and difficulties from contact with the criminal justice system , ’ said @entity40			1
the negative impacts can be great , he said			2
‘ criminal records that show up in searches can impede employment , reduce access to housing , thwart admission to and financing for higher education and affect civic and volunteer activities such as voting or adoption			0
they also can damage personal and family relationships			0

' experiencing formal contact with the criminal justice system could also have powerful effects on behavior and impose substantial constraints on opportunities for @entity1 's youth			2
' we know from our two studies that these experiences are prevalent and that they vary across different demographic groups			0
' going forward it will be constructive to support systematic studies into the sources of these variations and to continue efforts to understand the effects of criminal justice interventions on sanctions on future behavior			0
