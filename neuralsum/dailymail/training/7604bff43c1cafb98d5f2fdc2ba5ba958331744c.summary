climbers and trekkers travelling to the @entity2 could soon be required to take gps tracking units with them , following the country ’s worst ever trekking disaster			1
@entity7 officials are planning to introduce new rules , improve weather forecasts and better monitor the movement of tourists and local guides after at least 41 people were killed last week when a deadly blizzard and avalanches swept through the mountains			1
@entity18 official @entity17 said tourists visiting the country ’s popular mountain trails will be required to take trained local guides , and will have to rent a satellite navigation unit to help authorities trace them in case of an emergency			1
@entity7 's @entity26 , a 140mile collection of mountain trails , is hugely popular with trekkers and climbers he said the government plans to announce the new rules before the next trekking season in the spring			1
officials say 41 people , including foreign tourists and local guides , were killed last week and more than 500 stranded trekkers were rescued after becoming trapped in a snowstorm in the @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 districts north of @entity44			1
the area is hugely popular with tourists and on sunday @entity7 officials were forced to close a section of the popular @entity49 trekking circuit because new groups of hikers had continued to pour into the area where most of the victims died			1
the snowstorms were caused by cyclone that hit the @entity57 coast a few days earlier			0
hikers were stranded when the weather conditions deteriorated rapidly			0
a @entity7 army helicopter rescues survivors along the @entity26 where at least 41 people were killed following snow storms last week rescue members carry the dead bodies of trekkers from the @entity66 mountain pass in @entity7 , which was hammered by severe snowstorms and avalanches most of the victims were on or near the @entity49 trekking route , a 140 - mile collection of trails through the mountain range			1
many were caught on the @entity66 pass , one of the highest points on the circuit			0
however , experts have dismissed the idea of introducing the gps systems as a ‘ knee - jerk reaction ’			0
@entity84 , managing director for the @entity87 - based @entity86 mountaineering company said they would not prevent more disasters from occurring in @entity7			1
‘ technology alone is not a solution to the problem , ’ he said			0
‘ gps systems often do n’t work in harsh conditions anyway			0
‘ in this situation getting lost was not the problem , it was the fact that the climbers and their guides went out in a raging storm			2
‘ there needs to be better training and education in place for both the trekkers , local guides and porters on the mountains so that decision making is improved			1
‘ high - tech gadgets are n’t required to get weather forecasts			2
long - wave radio is available throughout the mountains and which is capable of providing accurate weather forecasts			0
‘ trekkers with little experience need to make sure they are hiring guides with sufficient training , knowledge and ability to draw upon in the event of an emergency			1
tour operators can charge up to £ 1,800 for a three - week trek around the @entity49 circuit @entity7 's @entity18 said tourists visiting the @entity127 will be required to take trained local guides , and will have to rent a satellite navigation unit to help authorities trace them in case of an emergency ‘ there needs to be a full public enquiry as to what went wrong , and no knee - jerk reactions ’			1
up to 12 @entity87 are still unaccounted for following the tragedy			0
half of the dead were @entity7 porters , guides and cooks , many of whom did not have any warm weatherproof coats or boots to protect them , something which has angered rescue leaders who claim @entity7 tour guides died because they were poorly equipped			1
they also suggest that foreign tourists were favoured in the rescue mission			2
captain @entity152 , the @entity7 @entity153 rescue leader who led more than 70 hikers to safety following the storm , said local victims had been wearing causal clothes , including flip flops and trainers			2
he told the @entity161 : ‘ the worst thing was seeing the equipment and gear of the @entity7 porters and guides because it meant they were dead , but they were not well - equipped			1
‘ the @entity169 i saw were wearing normal dress , some of them in slippers , some had coats and some did n’t			0
they did not have proper clothes or protection from the snow ... this could be a factor in why so many @entity169 died			0
’ tour operators charge up to £ 1,800 for a three - week trek around the @entity26 , but captain @entity152 suggested that some porters earn as little as £ 9 a day			0
his comments were supported by @entity184 , the @entity7 government ’s chief district officer in charge of the rescue effort in @entity41 , where most of the victims were found dead			2
‘ there was no preparation , ’ he said			0
‘ many trekkers that came into the storm arrived without planning			2
‘ their porters had no trekking shoes or coats			2
they were in sports shoes and normal clothes because they ’re poor - it is one of the causes of their deaths			0
' some of them died because they were too cold - it was freezing snow , five or six feet deep			0
’ @entity207 of the @entity208 of @entity7 said his group offers low cost clothing and equipment rental for porters and guides but many of them believe they do not need them			1
foreign trekkers often hire their own guides directly , rather than through established trekking companies , and are focused on keeping their costs down			1
‘ if the group is organised they have all the equipment but the tourists want cheaper , they get someone from the street to guide them			0
they want cheap , cheap , cheap ’ he said .			0

@entity7 tourism officials plan to introduce new rules to monitor tourists
it follows country 's worst trekking disaster which killed at least 41 people
@entity18 say trekkers will also be required to take trained guides
