@entity1 manager @entity0 named his squad for the start of the @entity5 qualifiers but has yet to explain to his employers why the @entity8 campaign went so horribly wrong			2
but pressure from members of the @entity12 board - concerned that such a dire performance would not receive the forensic post mortem it merited - has at least led to @entity0 meeting the @entity12 directors to discuss @entity16 2016 over two - and - a - half months on			1
looking forward : @entity0 has named his squad for the @entity5 qualifier with @entity19 summer of disappointment : @entity1 crashed out of the @entity8 at the group stages @entity0 is scheduled to talk to the board ahead of their september meeting when they will expect a full breakdown as to what can be put right ahead of @entity5			0
subjects will include whether the 88 - strong @entity12 party was too big in @entity30 and whether preparation was correct			0
surprisingly - especially following a @entity8 exit after just two games - there will be no official report but instead continuous assessment throughout the @entity12 on what to put right			0
@entity1 will have either home or away fixtures against four @entity41 giants - @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity16 and @entity44 - over the next two years to help drum up backing for a national team to be watched by its lowest crowd at the new @entity47 against @entity48 next wednesday			1
@entity12 general secretary @entity49 called the expected crowd of between 35,000 and 40,000 ‘ disappointing ’ and added ‘ there is some work to do ’ re-engaging with disillusioned regulars			0
@entity55 test : @entity1 will play @entity43 in a friendly - as well as @entity42 , @entity16 and @entity44 one ambitious plan is to build a new fanbase by enrolling 500,000 football fans in the revamped @entity59 , despite current members being upset at the way they ’re taken for granted			1
not many sporting bodies have the resources to invite representatives from 54 territories to @entity67 ’s most expensive playground @entity68 for basically a vanity project announcement			1
but @entity67 president @entity70 put up all of @entity67 ’s football powerbrokers in the @entity72 just to tell them during a brief 55 - minute summit that he would n’t be standing against @entity74 in the @entity76 elections next may as widely predicted			1
host : @entity70 put up all of @entity67 ’s football powerbrokers in the @entity72 @entity67 did n’t even put forward another candidate in the knowledge that @entity74 , who has the support of the five other confederations , is certain to win a ludicrous fifth term			1
an expected attack on @entity74 did n’t materialise , either , although @entity70 did tell his @entity67 representatives on the @entity86 not to be ‘ sheep and say yes to the omnipresent @entity74 all the time			1
’ the @entity12 board have effectively acknowledged that referee grandee @entity90 receiving only a slap on the wrist for his ghastly racist comment — ‘ you look rather tanned , have you been down a coal mine ? ’ — to an @entity12 colleague sent out all the wrong signals for an organisation supposedly cracking down on all forms of discrimination			0
wrong signals : the @entity12 have effectively acknowledged their lenient treatment of @entity90 sent the wrong message the protests - led by @entity105 - over @entity90 ’s ultra-lenient treatment have led to @entity12 directors agreeing there should be an independent element to future investigations over code of conduct breaches , rather than the inquiry being conducted entirely in - house			0
@entity47 @entity116 banker the @entity12 must believe @entity67 awarding @entity47 the final and semi-finals of @entity116 in @entity118 on september 19 is a formality			1
the official @entity12 party includes ineffective minister for sport @entity121 and only a representative for @entity125 mayor @entity124			0
@entity126 would n’t even comment on @entity1 ’s @entity8 debacle , despite travelling on official business to @entity30			0
meanwhile , the deep scars from the 2018 @entity8 election fiasco — when the @entity12 had pm @entity131 , @entity132 and prince @entity133 in @entity134 to secure just one vote from outside the @entity136 — look to have healed			0
@entity1 are considering bidding for @entity138 and believe hosting the @entity116 climax will not impact on that ambition			2
the @entity12 are also hopeful the feelgood factor from @entity143 ’s @entity142 will help @entity145 ’s @entity116 cause , with @entity147 and @entity148 expectant for the group stages as well			2
video @entity150 named @entity1 's captain			2

@entity1 set to play *glamour* friendlies with @entity42 , @entity44 , @entity16 and @entity43
@entity70 hosts @entity67 's powerbrokers in @entity68
the @entity12 are *confident* of @entity116 semi-final and final will be awarded to @entity47
