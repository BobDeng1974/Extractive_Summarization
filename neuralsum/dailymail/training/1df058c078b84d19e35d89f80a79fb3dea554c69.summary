by @entity1 reporter published : 12:06 est , 14 january 2014 updated : 12:07 est , 14 january 2014 many scientists believe it ’s only a matter of time before we find an @entity7 2.0 – a theorised planet much like our own			0
now one astronomer has put a date on it			0
dr @entity11 , who works for the @entity12 , believes we may find a planet like our own by 2024			1
his prediction is based on recent advances in technology that have allowed scientists to capture images of planets and their orbiting stars up to 63 light years away			1
dr @entity11 , who works for the @entity12 , believes we may find a planet like our own by 2024			1
pictured here is @entity24 exoplanet			0
this @entity7 - sized planet is found in the constellation @entity26 namely , the @entity28 , which last week took an image of a 10 - million - year - old planet named @entity31 b from 370 trillion miles away			1
@entity28 has been under development for nearly a decade , but this was the first image to be released by the instrument			1
‘ the search for @entity7 - like planets , the search for an @entity40 is very close , ’ said dr @entity11 works for the @entity12 in an interview with @entity37 from @entity38			1
‘ i think in 10 or 15 years we will have an @entity7 2.0 candidate			0
’ @entity28 's first light image of @entity47 b , a planet orbiting the star @entity47			1
the star , @entity47 , is blocked in this image by a mask so its light does n't interfere with the light of the planet			1
beta @entity56 b is a giant planet - several times larger than @entity58 - and is approximately ten million years old the @entity28 is the world 's most advanced planet hunting instrument built for the @entity61 in @entity62			1
it is designed to image extrasolar planets orbiting nearby stars			2
in 2011 , the @entity66 team was selected to carry out an 890 - hour survey campaign from 2014 to 2016 to search and characterise exoplanets around 600 stars			0
@entity28 , which is the size of a small car , detects infrared radiation from young @entity58 - like planets in wide orbits around other stars , equivalent to the giant planets in our own solar system not long after their formation			2
it does this using silicon microchip deformable mirrors to remove atmospheric turbulence , and something known as coronagraphic masks - a telescopic attachment designed to block out the direct light from a star so that nearby objects			0
scientists claim @entity28 is the most advanced such instrument to be deployed on one of the world ’s biggest telescopes – the eight - metre @entity61 telescope in @entity62			2
‘ even these early first - light images are almost a factor of 10 better than the previous generation of instruments , ’ said @entity95 of the @entity96 who led the team that built the instrument			2
‘ this is the grail of modern astronomy , ’ dr @entity11 told @entity38			1
‘ we 're trying desperately now to image those planets because we know they exist			2
‘ when you observe a planet with [ the now defunct telescope ] @entity24 , what you 've been doing is basically detecting the transit - the attenuation of [ the star 's ] light - due to the planet passing between us and the star			2
‘ now with @entity28 , the @entity28 , which is mounted at the eight meter class telescope in @entity62 we 're going to be able to see the planet itself			1
’ data from the @entity24 telescope suggests that one in every five sun - like stars in the @entity125 may have an @entity7 - sized planet circling it in the @entity127 - an area where liquid water could exist			0
but researchers recently suggested the figure could be even higher			0
scientists in @entity133 last week announced that @entity7 - sized planets can support life at least ten times further away from stars than previously thought			0
this means that cold rocky planets previously considered uninhabitable may be teeming with life beneath the surface			0
dr @entity11 believes @entity28 will be able to provide a clearer picture of exactly which planets are habitable			1
‘ this is the first light data			0
so it 's not perfect			0
it looks impressive but i 'm telling you : in six months it 's going to be even more impressive , ’ said dr @entity11			1
he added that there are currently some issues with the instrument			0
it 's new , and so has to be tuned to perform better			0
‘ imagine one day , we 're going to be able to see seasonal effects on these planets and be able to see if there is a biosphere , ’ he said			1
@entity28 has been under development for nearly a decade , but this is only the first image to be released by the instrument			2
scientists claim it is the most advanced such instrument to be deployed on one of the world 's biggest telescopes - the eight - metre @entity61 telescope in @entity62 ( pictured )			0

@entity11 ' prediction is based on advances in imaging technology
last week , @entity28 captured an image of a planet 63 light years away
' imagine one day , we 're going to be able to see seasonal effects on these planets , ’ dr @entity11 said in an interview with @entity38
