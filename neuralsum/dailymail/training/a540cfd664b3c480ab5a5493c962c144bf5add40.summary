reporters from @entity12 launched a probe into allegations about inappropriate behaviour by the @entity16 'll fix it legend towards schoolgirls just days after his death on october 29			1
but they were eventually told to spike the story , which was due to be broadcast just days before a @entity24 special celebrating the presenter 's life			1
@entity12 journalists interviewed three women who met sir @entity1 in the @entity29 when , as presenter of @entity31 , he was at the height of his fame , @entity25 reported			1
all three were teenage pupils at a school in @entity36 which the broadcaster visited regularly as part of his charity work			0
it is claimed that sir @entity1 took girls there for rides in his car			1
each of the women is said to have alleged that he had taken them out , individually , in his car and behaved inappropriately towards them			2
one of the women , who is now in her 50s , agreed to waive her anonymity and allow herself to be interviewed by @entity12 reporters on camera , the @entity25 said			2
the investigation was launched after journalists for the flagship @entity10 news programme discovered that complaints about sir @entity1 were made to @entity36 police in 2007 - nearly 40 years after the incidents were alleged to have taken place			2
police carried out their own investigation at the time , but the @entity59 was not convinced there was enough evidence to take action against the star			2
a @entity10 source told the @entity25 that journalists hoped to establish the truth of the claims and the details of the police investigation by interviewing the three women			0
but senior figures in the corporation then told reporters to scrap the report , which would have clashed with a @entity74 'll fix it tribute programme hosted by @entity77			0
height of his fame : the alleged inappropriate behaviour is said to have taken place while sir @entity1 was presenter of @entity31 the decision to spike the story is said to have angered many staff , who had spent months working on the report			1
' someone , somewhere should have realised that a report trying to uncover a dark side of one of the @entity10 ’s favourite sons was a silly thing to do , ' the source told the @entity25			0
@entity94 confirmed that allegations had been made and investigated , and a @entity59 spokesman said a reviewing lawyer had advised officers a lack of evidence meant no action could be taken			0
sir @entity1 's friends and family were upset at the revelations regarding the investigation			1
the star 's niece , @entity108 accused @entity12 of ' muck - raking '			1
she told the @entity25 : ' as a family we just wish sir @entity16 could be left to rest in peace			0
' @entity113 , sir @entity1 's friend of 30 years , who helped to organise his funeral , said : ' these are allegations from 40 years ago			1
he ’s not even alive to defend himself			0
' the @entity10 today insisted that @entity12 's investigation focused on alleged failings within the @entity59 , and the story was spiked because they did not have enough proof to stand it up - not because of executive interference			2
a @entity10 spokesman said : ' any suggestion that a story was dropped for anything other than editorial reasons is completely untrue			0
' the @entity10 gathers information on hundreds of stories and not all make it to air			0
in this case the angle we were pursuing could not be substantiated			0

@entity12 story had been due to broadcast days before a @entity24 special celebrating the star 's life
reporters interviewed three women who claimed he behaved inappropriately toward them as teenagers
sir @entity1 's friends and *relatives* tell of their fury at decision to investigate the allegations
