a decade ago the @entity1 handball player @entity2 laughed out loud when this reporter told him his name had become synonymous with a new species of county cricketer			2
the news that ‘ kolpak ’ may now be considered a term of racist abuse is unlikely to attract the same response			2
certainly , no - one at @entity14 — whose captain , @entity12 , finds himself at the centre of a racism storm — is laughing			1
according to reports , as yet not denied , @entity12 told @entity21 ’s @entity20 batsman @entity19 during a recent @entity23 match at @entity24 to : ‘ f * * * off back to your own country , you kolpak f * * * * *			1
’ @entity14 captain @entity12 ( right ) has become the first county cricketer to be accused of using racial language after a verbal altercation with @entity19 ( left ) during the @entity30 match earlier this month he now must appear before a disciplinary hearing next week to answer a charge of racial verbal abuse			1
he is said to be devastated			0
legal constraints mean both the @entity35 and @entity14 are staying tight - lipped about the details			2
but a truism still applies : a charge of racism is far easier to make than it is to prove			0
it is also a scar that can not be removed			0
people are not dubbed racist : they are branded			0
@entity12 ’s outburst was unpleasant , even if it turns out to be the case that he was provoked by @entity19			1
the best that can be said about telling someone to go back to their own country — whether or not it is spiced up by swear words or fuelled by adrenaline — is that it is deeply crass			0
throw in the @entity54 jibe — a reference to cricketers from outside the @entity57 who play domestically in @entity59 without adding to a county ’s overseas quota — and it could be argued that @entity12 insulted @entity19 on the grounds of his ‘ national origin ’ , one of the terms of reference in the @entity35 ’s code of conduct			1
@entity12 's @entity23 title celebrations were affected by the accusations but racism ? even those minded to take extra offence because of @entity19 ’s ethnicity — he is mixed race — might concede it can not possibly be that straightforward			1
if @entity12 ’s intention was to lambast @entity19 because he felt he was taking up a place in the county game that might otherwise have gone to a promising @entity59 youngster , then his sledge arguably contained a crude logic			1
yet it should be clear that to agree with @entity12 ’s sentiment is not to condone racism			1
the @entity35 need to tread carefully			0
on the day @entity12 clashed with @entity19 , @entity87 — a @entity89 - born muslim of @entity91 heritage — was jeered by @entity93 fans during a one - day international at @entity94			1
five days later , during a @entity96 international at the same venue , he was subjected to a second dose of mindlessness			0
the newly - crowned champions immediately vowed to fight to clear the name of their captain @entity12 the @entity35 said almost nothing , save to ‘ condemn abusive language or behaviour of any sort at cricket ’			1
it is not an immediately reassuring approach that glosses over cat - calling by several thousand spectators while zeroing in on the less clear - cut motivation of an individual cricketer			2
it is tempting to conclude that some targets are easier than others			0
this is about more than semantics , and about more than the precise nature of what prompted @entity12 to say what he did , which we can never know for sure			2
it ’s about the importance of not diminishing the awfulness of racism for those who can claim , without hesitation or legal argument , to have been its victim			0
call @entity12 misguided , if you like			2
but if you ’re going to suggest he ’s racist , you should be armed with more than a smart lawyer to prove your point			0
