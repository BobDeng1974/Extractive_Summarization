by @entity0 @entity1 added his name to a decidedly illustrious league of gentlemen when he completed his domination of the 114th @entity6 by wrapping up an overwhelming eight stroke victory on sunday			1
the absence of any hysteria on the course meant a prized addendum to the history books off it as he became just the fourth @entity15 golfer in the last 100 years to win two majors by the age of 30			2
the other three were @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			0
the 29 year old from @entity23 is also just the third golfer in the last 30 years to lead a major from start to finish , with the others being @entity21 and @entity28			0
anyway you look at it , therefore , this was right up there with the great performances and continues the recent domination of @entity36 ’s national championship by the cream of @entity15 golf			0
now there have been four @entity88 winners in the last five years , with @entity21 ( 2011 ) and @entity89 last year also successful			1
‘ i ’m thrilled to have won my second major and particularly by playing so well , ’ he said			2
‘ these are the moments that define your career and the way this week has gone has just been a dream			0
’ a special day in the annals of @entity15 golf was completed by the @entity100 teenager @entity99 , who sealed his own place in the history books with a fine last round of 69			1
the 19 - year - old became the first man since @entity106 in 1930 to win the silver medal for low amateur at both the @entity6 and the @entity43			1
there simply is no finer company to keep than the greatest amateur golfer of all time , and so no wonder he will make his professional debut at the @entity116 this week with a veritable skip in his stride			0
as so often is the case when the day is all about history , the spectacle suffers			0
it was like that when @entity28 strolled away from the field at @entity84 to win by 15 in 2000 and when @entity21 won by eight at @entity126			1
@entity1 was so good he never looked stressed at any point over the 72 holes			1
back in april , @entity21 said golf was crying out for a player , in the absence of @entity28 , to take the game by the scruff of the neck			0
now @entity1 has followed up his wire - to - wire success at the @entity136 in @entity137 last month with another dominant display			1
he ’s also boosted his bank balance by £ 2 million			0
the distant runner ’s - up were @entity36 @entity69 and the remarkable @entity80 , who both shot 72s			1
taking it in : @entity1 takes a deep breath after sinking his par putt to win his second major championship top team : the champion beams as he goes to embrace his caddie @entity148 congratulations : @entity69 , who tied for second , shows his respect for @entity1 on the 18th green even finish : @entity80 finished with a final round of 72 but no - one was going to catch @entity1 @entity66 delight at tough win defending champion @entity155 holed a long birdie putt at the last to finish tied 13th , the best of a disappointing @entity159 challenge			1
he finished a shot ahead of @entity162 and two in front of @entity21			0
he might not have won but it was only right that those in the grandstand at the 18th rose as one to salute 34 - year - old @entity80			1
it ’s almost seven years now since he believed he was suffering a heart attack so severe he rang his mum to say goodbye			0
@entity80 ’s father would later describe in moving detail the dark days watching doctors pound his son ’s transplanted heart in order to buy time			1
tragic fate would work in their favour when a 26 year old organ donor called @entity184 was killed in a hit and run accident			0
and so it was that @entity80 underwent his second heart transplant			2
now @entity190 ’s heart has found a perfect home alongside @entity80 ’s will			2
it really is a sporting feat for the ages that @entity80 is out here making a living on such a competitive professional circuit			2
the fact he finished tied second in the @entity43 is positively miraculous			1
inspiring : @entity80 's impressive showin for second comes seven years after a near - death experience with his heart honoured : defending champion @entity89 , the best of the @entity159 charge in 12th , does a @entity206 celebration flashback : @entity206 did the famous first pump on winning the @entity43 at @entity45 in 1999 before he went out to play , @entity80 ’s mum @entity210 received a note from @entity212 , @entity184 ’s father			1
it read : ‘ @entity214 we ’re proud of him and to go for it			0
’ there really wo n’t be a dry eye in the house when they reach that part in the inevitable movie , will there ? when @entity226 reached the 18th green , his caddy @entity224 raised his arm to the heavens , drawing fulsome applause			0
a momentous week that had seen him play with three @entity6 champions of various hue in @entity234 , @entity235 and @entity155 had reached a grand conclusion			2
asked what advice he had for @entity226 , @entity235 started laughing and said : ’ he hits it so well he should be advising me ! ’ you could see what it meant to @entity226 to be linked with @entity106 ’s record			1
‘ i was told just before i went out to play and it really is an honour , ’ he said			0
for his parents @entity247 and @entity248 it ’s back to real jobs in the real world tomorrow			0
asked whether @entity99 still lived with them , @entity248 replied : ’ of course he does			2
he ’s only 19 ! ’ and what a future lies ahead			0
history books : @entity256 's @entity99 won the silver medal for low amateur with a final round of 69 final flourish : the 19 - year - old is the first player since @entity106 in 1930 to achieve the amateur double of the @entity6 and the @entity43 go - pro : @entity226 makes his professional debut this week at the @entity116			1
