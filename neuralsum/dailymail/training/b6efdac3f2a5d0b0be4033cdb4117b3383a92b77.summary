by @entity0 published : 07:11 est , 2 january 2014 updated : 09:45 est , 2 january 2014 a no kill dog shelter taking in abandoned pooches took 32 unwanted chihuahuas in a single delivery			1
the animals , many bought as fashion accessories , were housed by @entity9 in @entity10 from pounds across the @entity11			1
founder , @entity12 , took in the huge canine delivery last month and is now looking to rehome the animals			2
‘ @entity23 became a fashion accessory after they were seen in the purses of @entity28 celebrities like @entity29			1
‘ they are currently the second most euthanised dog in @entity11 and thousands of @entity23 are killed every year			1
fashion accessories : chihuahuas became trendy after they were seen in the purses of @entity28 celebrities like @entity29 ‘ people need to understand that they are living creatures and they need to be loved and taken care of			1
’ ms @entity12 expects the number of abandoned chihuahuas to rise in the new year as dogs given as @entity41 presents may be given away			1
she said : ‘ chihuahuas are being euthanised at a high rate because they are misunderstood - their numbers are rising in shelters			1
ms @entity12 explained that huge numbers of chihuahuas are being abandoned as they become less fashionable ‘ i ca n't bear the thought of these dogs being killed in such high numbers so i will do what i can to give them a home			1
‘ a dog should n't be given as a gift			2
a dog is for life , not just for @entity41			2
’ ms @entity12 said many people abandon @entity23 because they do not understand their personalities and do n't train them the right way			2
she said : ‘ chihuahuas are a very loyal dog			1
if you do n't nurture them enough , or overly nurture them , they get overly possessive and nippy			2
‘ i personally love the breed because they all have their own quirky personalities and they 're very protective			0
‘ many people think that small dogs like @entity23 do n't need to be trained like big dogs , they think they just sit there and look cute			0
pooch paradise : there are currently 60 dogs living at @entity9 ‘ they do need to be trained and be given boundaries just like big dogs			0
’ according to ms @entity12 , there is an overabundance of @entity23 in some @entity11 states because dogs stay outside , breed and wander around without owners			0
many of the dogs that are taken to @entity9 are from @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91			0
ms @entity12 said : ‘ i 'd say about ninety percent of the dogs here would have been dead if we had n't taken them in			0
‘ dogs are euthanised differently depending on the shelter			0
sometimes dogs are killed by what 's called a heart stick , they put a needle in the heart and the heart stops			1
‘ other shelters will sedate the dogs - worst case scenario they will put them in a box and gas them to death			1
‘ there is nothing humane at all about euthanising a dog merely because of space			0
’ there are currently 60 dogs living at @entity9			0
ms @entity12 said : ‘ there 's so many of them and they all have such short hair , so five or six of them cuddle up in one bed together - it 's the cutest thing			0
’ while ms @entity12 is saving as many dogs as she can , she wishes she can take in more dogs			0
‘ when i ca n't save a dog , it 's heartbreaking because they haunt you and they stay with you forever because you know you 're their link to a new life and to life period			0
