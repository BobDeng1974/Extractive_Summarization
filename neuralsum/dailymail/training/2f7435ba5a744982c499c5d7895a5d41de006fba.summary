by @entity0 fossils of a sparrow - sized creature from @entity3 has cast doubts on the commonly held belief that birds evolved from ground - dwelling dinosaurs that slowly gained the ability to fly			2
it ’s long been thought theropods evolved this skill over time , but re-examination of the @entity14 fossils suggest they may have , instead , been tree - dwelling animals that learnt to glide			1
researchers want the creature to be reclassified as an early bird whose ancestors include tree - climbing archosaurs that lived in a time before dinosaurs			1

it was previously classified as a coelurosaurian theropod dinosaur , from which many experts believe flying dinosaurs and later birds evolved			2
researchers used advanced 3d microscopy , high resolution photography and low angle lighting to reveal structures not clearly visible before			0
through their investigations , the researchers found a combination of non-dinosaurian traits along with highly derived features			0

but new analysis , carried out by @entity64 of the @entity65 in @entity66 , @entity67 , and @entity68 of the @entity69 , suggests otherwise			0

these techniques made it possible to interpret the natural contours of the bones			0
through their investigations , the researchers found a combination of non-dinosaurian traits along with highly derived features			0
for example , it had birdlike features such as elongated forelimbs , wing and hind limb feathers , wing membranes in front of its elbow , half - moon shaped wrist - like bones , bird - like perching feet , a tail with short anterior vertebrae			1

these include birdlike forelimbs and wing feathers alongside claws that would have made tree climbing possible , and tail vertebrae similar to a @entity58 ( illustration pictured ) this reclassification would put @entity14 in a similar ancestry to the bird - line archosaur @entity106 , ( artist 's illustration pictured ) the researchers specifically note the primitive elongated feathers on the forelimbs and hind limbs			1
however , it was also found to have elongated tendons along its tail vertebrae similar to a velociraptor , and claws that would have made climbing trees possible			1
this suggests @entity14 is an ancestral form of early birds that mastered the basic manoeuvres of parachuting or gliding from trees			2
the team 's findings validate predictions first made in the early 1900 's that the ancestors of birds were small , tree - dwelling archosaurs which enhanced their ability to fly with feathers that enabled them to at least glide			1
this ‘ trees down ’ view is in contrast with the ‘ ground up ’ view embraced by many palaeontologists in recent decades that birds derived from terrestrial theropod dinosaurs			1
‘ the identification of @entity14 as a non-dinosaurian bird enables a reevaluation in the understanding of the relationship between dinosaurs and birds			1
scientists finally have the key to unlock the doors that separate dinosaurs from birds , ’ explained @entity64			0
@entity68 added , ‘ instead of regarding birds as deriving from dinosaurs , @entity14 reinstates the validity of regarding them as a separate class uniquely avian and non-dinosaurian			2
’ the ancestral archosaurs are thought to have originated 250 million years ago , in the late @entity157			0
their descendants , including the dinosaurs , were terrestrial vertebrates for a majority of the @entity163			0
the study appears in @entity166 's @entity165 .			0

the @entity14 , or ' climbing wing ' , fossil was found in @entity33
@entity172 microscopy revealed it *lacked* features to classify it as a dinosaur
it had birdlike features including elongated forelimbs and wing feathers
but , it also had claws that would have made tree climbing possible
birds were *typically* thought to have derived from theropod dinosaurs
instead , @entity14 should be seen as an early bird whose ancestors are among tree - climbing archosaurs that lived in a time before dinosaurs
