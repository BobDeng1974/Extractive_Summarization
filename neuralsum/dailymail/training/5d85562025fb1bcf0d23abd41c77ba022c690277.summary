by @entity0 published : 11:34 est , 1 august 2012 updated : 11:34 est , 1 august 2012 testing electrical activity of the heart using an electrocardiogram is unlikely to help doctors figure out who is at risk of coronary heart disease , according to recommendations from a @entity11 government - backed panel			2
the @entity12 claims that there is no good evidence the test , also known as an @entity16 , helps doctors predict heart risks any better than traditional considerations such as smoking , blood pressure and cholesterol levels in people with no symptoms			1
' it could potentially be helpful if we had evidence that doing a test like an ecg or an exercise @entity16 would better classify the people who are at high risk ' of heart disease , said @entity32 , a member of the task force from the @entity34			2
' ineffective ' : @entity16 , or @entity16 tests , are unlikely to help doctors pinpoint who is at risk of heart problems , researchers claim ( file picture ) ' then we could intervene more actively with the very high - risk group which has the highest potential to benefit			1
' the task force , which published a statement in the @entity46 , recommends against @entity16 screening of people considered at low risk for heart disease and says there 's not enough information to rule one way or the other on those at intermediate or high risk			0
on the other hand , there are both costs and possible harms associated with screening healthy adults , @entity32 said			0
blood pressure tests such as this one could be just as effective as an ecg in detecting heart problems , it is claimed ' the concern is that if people are already at low risk of heart disease and they have one of those tests , if they have an abnormality on the test it 's more likely it will be a false - positive result , ' she added			1
' but an abnormal result , whether a false positive or true positive , generally leads to additional testing , and it 's the additional tests that could have some risk			0
' while @entity79 themselves are inexpensive and non-invasive , the follow - up tests can involve passing a tube through the heart or other more intensive , costly procedures			1
the new recommendations are an update of the @entity12 's 2004 guidelines , which also called for no screening in low - risk adults and said there was insufficient evidence to assess the risks and benefits for screening intermediate - and high - risk people			0
@entity32 said that instead of asking for tests , people concerned about their heart health can discuss diet , lifestyle and family history risks with their doctor , who can then use a risk calculator to determine their chance of getting heart disease - and treat them appropriately			0
' everyone can benefit from being physically active , ' she said			0
' everyone can benefit from not smoking , and people can discuss with their doctors whether they could benefit from taking medication to lower their blood pressure or lower their cholesterol			1

looking at smoking and cholesterol levels could be just as effective as @entity79 , researchers claim
