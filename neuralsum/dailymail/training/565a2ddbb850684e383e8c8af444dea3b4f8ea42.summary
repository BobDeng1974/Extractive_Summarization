@entity5 , a high court judge in @entity7 , said leading the probe was the ' biggest challenge ' she has ever faced as she set out plans to start in april			1
the inquiry has already lost two potential heads , @entity14 and dame @entity15 , who stood aside amid concerns over their establishment links			1
@entity5 , a high court judge in @entity7 , said leading the probe could last up to four years home secretary @entity19 was forced to scour the globe to find a chairman for the inquiry , after fears leading figures in the @entity25 would be seen as too close to the @entity4			1
giving evidence to mps , judge @entity5 , the third chair - designate of the @entity27 into @entity28 , told the @entity31 she was reluctant to set a timescale for the inquiry as this stage			1
but she said it had been indicated when she took the job that it could take ' three years , possibly into a fourth '			1
she added : ' given the breadth of the subject matter and the timespan involved , that does not seem inordinate			0
' it is a long time but what will be important , in my view , is to carefully scope the inquiry to see how it should be managed and to inform along the way of the progress of the inquiry and perhaps to set milestones for interim reports			1
' mrs may has insisted she is confident that thorough checks have been carried out to ensure there are no conflicts of interest that could undermine her appointment			0
mrs @entity63 , arriving at @entity60 to give evidence to mps , said the inquiry was her biggest ever challenger @entity67 mp @entity66 , the committee chairman , asked judge @entity5 : ' would you regard yourself as being part of the establishment ? ' she replied : ' we do n't have such a thing in my country and i did have to ask carefully what is meant by it so that i did understand what i was being asked to disclose			1
' my understanding is do i have any links into any institution or any person relevant to the subject matter of the inquiry ? and no , i do n't			1
' judge @entity5 said she arrived in the @entity25 yesterday and had already met the home secretary and sex abuse survivor groups			1
she told the committee she will step down from her full - time job as a judge in @entity7 and relocate to the @entity25 for the duration of the inquiry , although she has yet to be awarded a work permit			1
her husband will join her in the @entity25 as often as he can , but her grown up children will remain in @entity7			1
' it is the biggest challenge i have faced yet , ' she told mps			1
the @entity101 received more than 150 nominations from survivors , their representatives , mps and members of the public , mrs may said			1
the @entity108 was also tasked with combing the @entity109 to identify any suitable candidates from abroad			0
it will be a new statutory inquiry , and not a @entity112 as some victims had hoped			2
with a legal status set out under the @entity116 , it will have the power to compel witnesses to give evidence			0
new inquiry chairman justice @entity5 ministers scoured the globe in search of a suitable chairman for the child abuse inquiry , after two previous appointees resigned over links to the @entity4			1
the @entity108 approached all @entity109 countries , and the decision was made to appoint justice @entity5 , a serving high court judge in @entity7			1
the 66 - year - old helped to establish the @entity131 for sexual abuse victims , and helped to change the way @entity7 police dealt with abuse cases			1
in 2007 she was appointed chairman of the @entity137			2
during her tenure the authority released a report on the outcome of its inquiry into police handling of child abuse cases , which had begun in august 2009			2
she has also served as an independent expert to the @entity147 @entity146			0

' married to @entity155 @entity154 , miss @entity63 has three step - children , and one daughter from her first marriage			0
she breeds and races horses			0
last week mrs may announced the original inquiry would be axed and replaced with a new panel			1
she conceded that not every victim would be happy with what she announced today			2
but she told @entity165 : ' let me be clear			0
i am now more determined than ever to expose the people behind these despicable crimes and the people in institutions that knew about abuse but did n't act , that failed to help when it was their duty , sometimes their very purpose to do so			0
' and the people and institutions that in some cases positively covered up evidence of abuse			0
' what we have seen so far in @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 and elsewhere is only the tip of the iceberg			0
' with every passing day , with every new revelation , it is clear that sexual abuse of child has taken and is taking place on a scale that we still can not fully comprehend			0
' she said the authorities had ' let down too many ' victims over many years , telling mps : ' i can not stand here and say there has been no cover - up			1
' at the time she said the inquiry will take longer than 12 months , but must not be allow to ' go on endlessly ' , mrs may added			2
she will urge miss @entity63 to set a date to publish a report , to prevent a repeat of the @entity207 into the @entity209 war which has not been published after six years			2
the inquiry has been dogged with problems since it was first announced by mrs may last summer			1
the panel of experts was created to examine evidence that successive governments , charities , political parties , the @entity218 , the @entity219 and the @entity220 failed to protect children from paedophiles			0
