@entity0 is always a boom time for the perfume industry — the run - up to the big day accounts for more than half of all perfume sales for the year — but it seems that it ’s not all going to be @entity6 and @entity7 sitting under the tree			1
last week it was revealed that scents from stars such as @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 are outselling established fragrance brands such as @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 by as much as three to one			1
but are these perfumes actually any good , or are they simply trading in on a name ? to find out , we asked fragrance expert , @entity23 , of @entity24 , @entity26 ’s oldest independent perfumery , to blind - sniff some of the best - selling celebrity scents from @entity29 , and give his verdict , before revealing to him exactly who was behind each one			1
the results may put some noses out of joint			1
@entity36 - @entity35 @entity37 , £ 27 for 50ml this smells very soapy and clean because it ’s based on the sort of notes often used to fragrance washing powder			1
add peach — as you ’ve got here — or white florals , and you get something slightly reminiscent of very posh laundry detergent			1
musk scents like this are very cheap to make in a laboratory and can make a fragrance long - lasting , but unless they ’re mixed well , smell a bit flat			1
this is not as sugary as some , and really rather nice			1
initially i thought that this was @entity58 , but i can see how it works for @entity14 playing on her girl next door image			1
nice and gentle if you like clean floral scents			1
4/5 @entity63 signature , £ 14.99 for 75ml this is exactly what you ’d expect from a celebrity fragrance : generic and rather cheap			1
it ’s very fruity , very sugary with some white florals in there			1
they can be quite sweet and sickly , but this is n’t			1
the floral notes are very thin			1
i ’d guessed this was @entity14 , because as an international style ambassador you ’d expect better of @entity63			1
2/5 @entity58 collector ’s edition , £ 39.50 for 100ml this has more of the sugar - iness i mentioned			1
these are the sort of cloying scents you ’ll find yourself choking on , when you ’re sitting behind someone on the bus who is wearing too much of it			1
i thought it was @entity92 , but it turns out to be teen icon @entity58			1
i can see the appeal of the bottle , which comes with a gold record charm			2
2/5 @entity97 @entity98 , £ 19.99 for 100ml goodness , this is much more interesting than many of the others			2
there are slightly richer floral notes going on in here			2
you ’re not being hit in the face with sugar , there ’s a warmer , more gourmand vanilla note in it as well			2
i can smell a nice orange blossom , rose and a bit of patchouli			2
my first guess was @entity63 as i had faith in her doing something a bit different			2
i would n’t have thought it was @entity97 — and the bottle ’s quite interesting , too			2
4/5 one direction you & i , £ 19.99 for 100ml this is very syrupy and fruity			2
there ’s quite a bit of peach in here — it ’s a popular scent so many fragrances use it			2
but i ’m also getting that horrible plasticky apple note that you ’ll find in @entity16 ’s @entity130			2
it really hits you in the back of the throat , but if you like that perfume , you might very well like this			1
there ’s a bit of jasmine and tuberose in the heart but it ’s basically very summery and very fruity			2
to me though , it smells like a shampoo			0
i thought it was @entity13 ’s			0
and although i ’m sure the pentagon - shaped bottle is meant to represent the five members of the band , it ’s quite uninspiring			0
2/5 britney spears fantasy , £ 19.99 for 100ml this is really generic — it ’s like the paint - by - numbers recipe for the sort of sugary white floral that you see at this end of the market			0
they always start with something fruity , mango or peach , then there ’s some white flowers at the heart — jasmine , tuberose , maybe gardenia — and the base is wood or musks			0
but there ’s no real depth to it , it ’s just sugar			0
i suppose finding out it ’s @entity12 is n’t that much of a surprise , and the bottle is one of the ugliest i ’ve seen.1 / 5 @entity13 rise , £ 19.99 for 100ml this is actually really nice			0
it ’s quite clean , quite fresh , and has a very classic @entity182 style to it			0
at the top it ’s very citrussy , the florals are basic but not overly sugary and overall it ’s quite refreshing			1
initially i guessed @entity188 , but then i thought @entity92 — i really was n’t expecting @entity13			0
and , while it ’s pleasant , i would n’t say it was the ‘ empowering ’ scent for women she claims she was aiming for			0
4/5 @entity193 @entity194 , £ 28.50 for 50ml urgh , this smells like those disgusting bright green sour apple sweets you find — or like an apple vodka alcopop			0
there ’s something really childish about it : there ’s a bit of blackcurrant or peach coming through , but it ’s all fruit and all sweet			0
it ’s like being in a sweet shop — really horrible			0
i thought it had to be one direction because it was so pre-pubescent , and there had been absolutely no attempt to make it more sophisticated			0
you ’d have to be a real fan of breakthrough artist of the year @entity193 to want this			0
1/5 @entity188 @entity216 , £ 31.50 for 50ml mmmm , this is n’t bad at all			0
there ’s something of the @entity220 about it — it reminds me of the citrussy , clean scents that were very popular then , such as @entity225 from @entity226			1
after the @entity228 , when everything had been quite dark and heavy with scents like @entity6 ’s @entity231 , the @entity220 trend was for lighter and zestier scents			1
and there ’s a nice pepperiness to it too			0
i did guess this was @entity188 and i ’m impressed by the bottle too : it looks very high end in a @entity241 or @entity7 type way			0
5/5 @entity92 @entity242 , £ 19.99 for 75ml another of those very fruity fragrances , this is slightly more subdued and less cloying than some of the others			0
there ’s a strong blackcurrant note in it , but in a very ribena-esque way , and some sort of muted strawberry as well i thought this had to be @entity12 as it seemed to be targeting young teenagers and i was taken aback to find out it was @entity92 ’s			0
her whole persona is about being outrageous so you would expect her to be doing something different			0
but there ’s nothing sexy about this — it ’s incredibly unprovocative for someone who courts controversy			0
3/5 all fragrances are available at @entity29 ( theperfumeshop.com )			0
