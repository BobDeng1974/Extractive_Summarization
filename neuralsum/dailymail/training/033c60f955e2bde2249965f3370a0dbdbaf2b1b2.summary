by @entity0 last updated at 7:35 pm on 10th january 2012 @entity1 denies two charges of causing death by dangerous driving , and two alternative charges of causing death by careless driving two men who stopped on a motorway hard shoulder to change a tyre were killed instantly when a articulated lorry crashed straight into them			1
victims @entity13 and @entity15 were ' sitting ducks ' when the lorry drifted into the hard shoulder of the @entity19 , killing them instantly , @entity12 heard today			1
lorry driver @entity1 , 61 , of @entity20 , @entity21 , denies two charges of causing death by dangerous driving , and two alternative charges of causing death by dangerous driving			1
another lorry driver who witnessed the crash told how it was like a scene from the film @entity29 where he could see what was going to happen but was powerless to stop it			1
prosecuting barrister @entity33 said that on the morning of september 10 , mr @entity13 , 39 , of @entity34 in @entity35 and mr @entity15 , 69 , of @entity36 , @entity37 , left their homes for what they would have imagined to have a normal day at work for them			1
their job was to travel to @entity46 and pick up some vehicles for delivery to an auction centre in @entity36			1
' a flat tyre on one of the vehicles being towed started the terrible chain of events that led to their tragic deaths in quite horrific circumstances , ' mr @entity33 told the jury as he opened the case			1
they stopped their vehicles on the hard shoulder of the north bound @entity19 near @entity64 and the two men started to change the defective wheel themselves			1
the pair were killed minutes later when @entity68 's lorry smashed into them			1
mr @entity33 said that one of the issues that the jury would have to determine in the case - probably the central issue - was whether the defendant had suffered any medical episode while at the wheel causing him to lose consciousness and control of the vehicle			2
it was claimed by the defence that he may have suffered the effects of a mini stroke			2
the tragic collision had been captured by a @entity86 motorway camera and also on the on - board camera of a @entity89 vehicle which was passing the scene at the time			1
@entity68 had left @entity92 at about 06.10am heading for @entity93 and stopped for breakfast on the @entity95 at @entity96 and for fuel north of @entity98			2
moments before the impact eyewitness @entity99 was driving a hgv when he saw the defendant move out into lane three where @entity103 were prohibited			2
the defendant suddenly corrected himself back into lane two in a jerky movement , said mr @entity99			2
then he saw the defendant 's lorry drift into the hard shoulder before coming back into lane one			2
but within a second or so the defendant was going back onto the hard shoulder , it was claimed , and mr @entity99 could see the people ahead at the parked vehicles			2
' he described it like the film @entity29 where he could see what was going to happen but was powerless to stop it , ' mr @entity33 explained			1
he estimated that about half of the defendant 's vehicle was on the hard shoulder and that the two men were sitting ducks			0
' all he could do was desperately push hard on his horn with both hands to try and get the defendant 's attention , ' mr @entity33 added			0
' the defendant neither slowed or braked and the next thing mr @entity99 heard was a bang			0
' @entity12 , where the jury heard that @entity13 and @entity15 were ' sitting ducks ' when the lorry drifted into the @entity19 hard shoulder the pathology evidence was that both men died instantaneously when hit			0
out of respect to them and their families , mr @entity33 said that he would not describe in any detail the severity of their injuries			0
at the scene it was claimed that the defendant said that one of the victims must have stepped into the road because he never went over ' the rumble strips '			1
he also said he could not move over because of a foreign vehicle behind him - but the films showed that neither claim was true , said mr @entity33			0
interviewed , he said that he just felt a bang or a bump and did not know what he had hit and claimed that he had not entered the hard shoulder			0
but when the @entity161 footage was shown to him he answered no comment			0
he also said that he had in the past suffered mini-strokes			0
' the prosecution say quite bluntly that the idea that he suffered any kind of attack that caused him to lose control of his vehicle is a complete red herring , ' said mr @entity33			0
' the driving that you can so graphically see is that of a lorry driver who is either paying no attention to his driving or drifting in and out of sleep			0
' that is grossly irresponsible and quite simply dangerous			0
' the trial , before @entity179 , judge @entity180 , continues .			0

it was like a scene from the film @entity29 , says witness to the crash
