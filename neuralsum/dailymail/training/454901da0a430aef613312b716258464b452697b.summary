by @entity1 reporter published : 18:40 est , 28 august 2012 updated : 09:12 est , 29 august 2012 the number of cancer drugs being rejected by the health watchdog has risen by 50 per cent in two years , a report has revealed			1
campaigners say @entity7 is saying no to more treatments since the government introduced its flagship @entity11 , which was meant to supplement the number available			1
since 2010 , ministers have set aside £ 200million a year for the fund to pay for cancer drugs which have not been approved by @entity7 for use on the @entity16 but which doctors think may help patients			1
a report by the @entity33 shows that in 2011/12 11 new treatments were rejected by @entity7 – many because they were not ‘ cost - effective ’ – out of 19 put forward			1
this represents nearly 60 per cent of the total			0
but in 2009/10 only seven new drugs were turned down out of 15 put forward , just 46 per cent of the total			2
this is despite the fact that the cost of the new drugs has decreased , which should mean @entity7 is more inclined to agree they should be paid for by the @entity16			2
concerned : @entity45 , chief executive of the @entity33 , said there were widespread variations in the treatments available on average , the cost of cancer drugs being assessed by @entity7 was £ 44,956 per patient last year , down from £ 51,797 in 2009/10			1
the drugs turned down last year include treatments for advanced breast cancer , bowel cancer , prostate cancer and leukaemia			1
but the charity points out that it is far better that cancer drugs are approved by @entity7 in the first place because there is no guarantee that patients will get them through the @entity11			1
its report reveals a stark postcode lottery with certain areas of the country far more likely to agree to pay for drugs through the fund than others			2
it also shows that hundreds of patients are being turned away from funding even though last year £ 89million of the £ 200million went unspent			2
@entity45 , chief executive of the charity , said : ‘ it is concerning that there are widespread variations in the treatments which are routinely available , increasing anxiety for patients and resulting in unnecessary bureaucracy			0
‘ at a time when the @entity11 is underspent , it is unacceptable that patients are still being turned down for the drugs their doctors think could help them			1
’ the report shows that since the fund began in october 2010 it has paid for the treatments of more than 13,000 patients			0
but 307 were refused treatment even though their specialist doctors strongly believed it could help extend their life or make it more bearable			0
a @entity7 spokesman said : ‘ if a drug is clinically and cost - effective then we will recommend it for use on the @entity16			0
‘ but if there is n’t sufficient evidence to show that a drug provides benefits over and above currently available medicines , or if the price the @entity16 is being asked to pay is too high to justify its benefits , then we can not recommend it			0
‘ the independent appraisal committee makes decisions in the same rigorous manner , based on evidence provided , as it did before the introduction of the @entity11			0
’ video : @entity111 says the government values @entity114 's report into cancer care ... and hopes hospitals will take note ...			0

@entity7 is saying no to more treatments than it did before @entity11 was introduced . campaigners say
fund set up by @entity112 was intended to supplement the number of drugs available
drugs turned down last year include treatments for advanced breast cancer and prostate cancer
