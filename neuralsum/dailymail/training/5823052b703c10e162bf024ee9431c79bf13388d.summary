@entity0 applied for the vacant @entity3 manager 's job as he looks to return to football			1
the @entity5 apparently threw his hat into the ring as wanderers look to replace @entity9 , who left ' by mutual consent ' last week			0
however , @entity0 is unlikely to get the job , say the @entity12			0
he has been out of work since being fired by @entity14 in september last year but has good lower - league credentials from his time at @entity17			0
the 58 - year - old is currently preparing @entity30 for the start of the @entity33 season but would be willing to talk about a return to @entity8 , for whom he played more than 200 times between 1974 and 1982			0
it is thought he would favour a role using his experience to oversee a young , up - and - coming coach , such as current @entity3 academy director @entity40			1
@entity25 , currently managing @entity30 , is keen to talk to @entity3 about a role at the club @entity43 and @entity44 are the bookies ' favourites , while @entity48 captain and assistant manager @entity47 - who is boss of @entity50 - is also linked			1
@entity51 , another out - of - work boss , has also been mentioned in @entity52 and it is thought wanderers could be keen on the @entity54			2
@entity3 are currently bottom of the championship and face @entity57 away in their next match on october 18 , by which time they would hope to have appointed a new manager			2
