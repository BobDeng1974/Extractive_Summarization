by @entity0 published : 01:37 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 02:29 est , 7 august 2013 when an elderly miner claimed to have found a vein of semi-precious stone in 1945 , it was dismissed by many as an old miner 's tale			1
@entity8 promised to reveal the exact location to @entity10 , then 19 , but died before he could take him to the site			1
now , seventy years after searching , mr @entity10 's grandson has finally discovered the lost seam of blue john stone in the picturesque @entity16 's @entity15			1
discovery : seventy years after searching , @entity10 ( left ) and his grandson @entity18 ( right ) have the semi-precious stone in their hands mr @entity10 , who is now 87 , and his family spent seven decades searching for the deposit			1
it was his grandson , @entity18 , 21 , who finally found the stone after noticing something unusual in the floor of the @entity29			1
mr @entity18 , who has been learning about mining for @entity32 stone , said : ' after an hour of digging through muddy deposits i was amazed to come across an old piece of carpet supported by some wooden batons			2
' i could n't believe my eyes when we pulled away the old carpet and there was this most amazing deposit of blue john stone			1
' it was right under the ladder that my grandfather put in decades ago			0
he must have walked over @entity8 's old find thousands of times over the years			2
' @entity18 learnt how to mine for blue john stone after his grandfather told him about the treasure @entity10 was told by a miner in 1945 that the rare seam existed in the @entity16 mr @entity10 , whose family took over the running of the cavern in 1945 , said : ' when my grandson telephoned to tell me that he had found @entity8 's old deposit , i could n't believe it			1
' after all these years it was right under my feet			2
i 'm 87 now and retired years ago but , when i heard the news , i just had to put on my old mining overalls and make the trip back into the cavern to see the deposit for myself			2
' the old miner @entity8 was not in the best of health and was retiring			0
he told me of this fantastic deposit of @entity32 he had found and asked me to help him get it out			0
' we planned to return to the cavern the next day but sadly @entity8 was taken ill and died			0
over the years i have spent countless hours searching for that deposit			2
' precious : a tray of resin treated blue john stone found in the @entity16 @entity32 is made from fluorspar which has reacted with other chemicals to give it its distinctive banded streaks			1
the mineral was formed millions of years ago , although only a small quantity is allowed to be mined each year			2
@entity29 has been designated as a @entity86 and is a show cave featuring spectacular stalactite formations			0
it is one of only two working @entity32 mines in the world , providing the stone for jewellery and ornaments - much of which is hand - crafted in workshops on site			0
telling the truth : @entity100 in the @entity29 in the 1940s @entity102 , mr @entity10 's daughter and mr @entity18 's mother , now manages @entity29			1
she said : ' i grew up with stories of @entity8 's lost deposit			0
to be honest i thought it might have been a bit of an old miner 's tale			0
' if my father had n't found it after all these years , maybe it did n't exist			0
it is a fantastic discovery			0
@entity116 is learning the trade and has a great eye for it , it must be in his blood			0
' it is a sizeable deposit and we conservatively estimate that there is enough blue john stone in this deposit to keep us busy for the next decade at least			1
