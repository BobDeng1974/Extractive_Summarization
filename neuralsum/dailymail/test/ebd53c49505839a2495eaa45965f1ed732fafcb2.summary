the @entity0 is to have an @entity2 espresso maker so astronauts can have a break from instant coffee to ' boost spirits ' @entity7 is scheduled to launch its unmanned rocket with the espresso maker — and 4,000 pounds of food , science research and other equipment — on monday afternoon			1
the experimental espresso machine is intended for @entity0 astronaut @entity14 of @entity2			1
the final version will be the first real @entity2 espresso machine on @entity24 on monday a version of the coffee maker is scheduled for launch to the @entity0 aboard a supply capsule which will also include 4,000 pounds of food , science research and other equipment it was supposed to arrive in january , shortly after her arrival , so she could get some relief from the station 's instant coffee			1
but it ended up on the back burner after a station shipment from @entity40 was lost in a launch explosion			2
the espresso machine was originally intended for astronaut @entity14 of @entity2 so she could get a break from the station 's instant coffee the espresso maker is dubbed @entity47 — @entity20 standing for @entity0			1
@entity2 coffee giant @entity18 joined forces with the @entity50 - based engineering company @entity21 and the @entity51 to provide a specially designed machine for use off the planet			1
it is the first coffee machine able to work in micro gravity on the @entity20 , where the principles that regulate the fluid dynamics of liquids and mixtures are very different from those typical on @entity64			1
it uses a ' capsule system ' to fill plastic pouches with espresso and other hot drinks such as tea			2
the machine can also be used to rehydrate food			0
in order to handle liquids at high pressure and high temperature in a space environment , the plastic tubing inside the normal coffee machines has been replaced with a steel tubes designed to withstand pressure of more than 400 bar			1
the @entity20 machine uses a standard coffee capsule , which is posted in the top of the machine			1
water is aspirated and pressurised in a unique electrical system and is then heated			0
the granules mix with the hot water and the coffee is piped into a pouch , which is securely fastened to the machine using a ' rapid coupling / uncoupling system			2
' the @entity20 machine is the first coffee machine able to work in micro gravity , where the principles that regulate the fluid dynamics of liquids and mixtures are very different from those typical on earth hovering up to 270 miles ( 435 km ) above the @entity64 , the @entity0 ( pictured ) is a long way from home and astronauts have reported missing creature comforts such as coffee and beer astronauts drink the coffee straight from the pouch using a straw			1
the machine is much heavier than a normal model , which typically weighs 29lbs ( 13kg )			0
the space - bound machine weighs around 44lbs ( 20kg ) because there are backups of all the critical components , for safety reasons , and in accordance with the specifications agreed upon with the @entity51 @entity55 's space station program deputy manager , @entity120 , said it 's all part of making astronauts feel at home as they spend months — and even up to a year — in orbit			1
already , @entity125 gives astronauts full access to email , phone calls , private video hookups , and live news and sports broadcasts			0
the @entity20 machine uses a normal @entity18 coffee capsule , which is posted in the top of the machine			1
water is aspirated and pressurised in a unique electrical system and is then heated			0
the granules mix with the hot water and the coffee is piped into a pouch , which is securely fastened to the machine using a ' rapid coupling / uncoupling system			2
' astronauts drink the coffee straight from the pouch using a straw			2
' the psychological support is very , very important , ' @entity148 told reporters on sunday			0
he continued : ' if an espresso machine comes back and we get a lot of great comments from the crew ... it 's kind of like the ice cream thing , right , when we fly ice cream every now and then			1
' it 's just to boost spirits			0
maybe some rough day , a scoop of ice cream gets them over that hump kind of thing			0
' the @entity168 supply ship also holds experiments for @entity55 's one - year space station resident @entity171 , who moved in a couple weeks ago			1
@entity174 cosmonaut @entity173 also will remain on board until march 2016			0
this will be the @entity179 - based @entity7 company 's seventh station supply run since 2012 , all from @entity180			1
for the third time , @entity7 will attempt to land its leftover booster vertically on an ocean barge			0
improvements to the first - stage booster and floating platform — based on lessons learned from the january and february attempts — should boost the odds of success this time to 75 per cent or maybe 80 per cent , said @entity192 , vice president of mission assurance for @entity7			0
@entity7 's billionaire founder @entity193 wants to save time and money by reusing the boosters normally discarded in the @entity197			0
in fact , the company is transforming a former missile - launching site at @entity180 into a landing pad for its revolutionary flyback boosters			0
monday 's launch time is 4.33pm			2
forecasters put the odds of good weather at 60 per cent			0
once the coffee is brewed , it 's dispensed in a pouch , which astronauts drink straight from using a straw			2

the espresso maker , named the @entity20 maker after the @entity0 , is set for lift off on monday
it was designed by @entity2 coffee giant @entity18 , engineering company @entity21 and the @entity51
the experimental machine was specially designed to for use off the planet
it was originally intended for @entity0 astronaut @entity14 of @entity2 as relief from the station 's instant coffee
@entity55 's space station program deputy manager , @entity120 , said it is being sent as part of the goal of making astronauts feel at home
