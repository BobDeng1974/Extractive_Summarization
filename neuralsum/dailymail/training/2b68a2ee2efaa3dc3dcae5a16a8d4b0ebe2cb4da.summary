blame : @entity1 transport secretary @entity0 said that @entity2 set a poor example to children @entity2 has been blamed for a lack of women train drivers by the shadow transport secretary			1
@entity0 said it was a ‘ national scandal ’ that there were so few women drivers on the railways , but was ridiculed for saying that the popular children ’s story was partly to blame			1
she said all the main characters in the original books – published in the 1940s – are male , and the only female characters are an ‘ annoyance , a nuisance and in some cases a danger ’ to the railway			2
‘ there is a preponderance of men in the transport industry and i am very keen to unpack some of the myths that stop women from taking up what are often highly - paid and highly - skilled jobs , ’ she said			0
her remarks led @entity34 , a @entity35 mp , to suggest that @entity2 ’s creator , the reverend @entity43 , ‘ forgot he was meant to serve as one of @entity39 ’s agents of social change ’ when he wrote his stories all those years ago			0
‘ this is rather emblematic of @entity39 and socialism , ’ he said			0
‘ it ca n’t stop meddling with things that really should n’t concern it – even children ’s stories			0
’ there are 1,000 women working as train drivers , which equates to just 4.2 per cent of the total number			1
