@entity1 spirits may need lifting at some point in the coming months			1
with a @entity5 on the horizon in which they are n't expected to pull up any trees in , @entity4 will be intent on needing an easy pick - me - up			2
and the skipper may just have found it , for @entity11 appears a dab hand at none other than the ukulele			1
in his hotel before @entity1 's fifth one - day international against @entity17 on wednesday , the @entity15 showcased his concealed talent in front of the @entity21 cameras			1
@entity11 was videoed strumming along to @entity23 ' @entity22 by the @entity21 website the 23 - year - old claims his ukulele skills are ' horrendous ' and refuses to sing when playing @entity23 ' @entity22 was the song of choice as @entity11 strummed along to the tune made famous by the band who hail from his home city , @entity32			1
@entity4 may urge the 23 - year - old to opt for something slightly more uplifting if he does indeed perform in front of the touring squad â€“ but @entity11 does n't appear overly confident in his ability			1
' i 'm horrendous at it , ' he said			2
' i ca n't really sing , so i try to make sure i play loud enough so no one can hear that			2
' it sounds horrendous at the minute			2
but i hope , one day , it might sound all right			0
' what @entity11 is more bullish about are @entity1 's chances of resurrecting the series against @entity46 ' side			1
@entity23 ( pictured at the @entity48 awards in 2007 ) also hail from the @entity15 city of @entity32 @entity11 will be part of the @entity1 squad to face @entity17 in the fifth one - day international on wednesday they trail 3 - 1 in the seven - match series , but the batsman sees this as a chance to show how they can perform under pressure			1
' there 's no reason why we ca n't , ' he said			0
' i think we showed in every game at some point that we 're capable of doing that			0
now we have to put it into one complete performance			0
even the game we did win we were n't at our best , which is promising			0
' but we do n't want to talk about being promising all the time			0
now is the time for us to step up and start putting in performances			0
this is a great opportunity for us to do it under pressure before a @entity5			0
