a grieving mother has been left furious after the council she works for sent her a £ 700 bill for a bench in memory of her three - year - old daughter			1
the bench was put up in @entity7 , @entity8 , last year in memory of councillor @entity10 's daughter , @entity9 , who tragically died in january 2013 from blood poisoning			1
but a few weeks ago cllr @entity10 received a letter from @entity13 , the council 's chairman , asking her about repayments			1
councillor @entity10 on the bench in memory of her daughter in @entity7 , @entity7			1
she was told funds would be raised to pay for it , but @entity23 have now said she must pay the £ 700 bill @entity25 , who has been with the @entity23 for 11 years , said the letter was an insult to her dead daughter			1
this incident is the latest embarrassment for the beleaguered town council , after a report last month into its workings identified a catalogue of weaknesses and potentially unlawful practices			2
a report by the @entity39 , uncovered ' a number of significant weaknesses in the @entity23 's governance			1
' the report said : ' in particular we have identified evidence that poor governance has led to the @entity23 to make decisions due consideration of its legal powers and , as a consequence , to take actions that may be unlawful			2
' the report concluded that the council has failed to properly safeguard public money because of a lack of internal controls			2
@entity58 claims the council has previously paid for benches in memory of councillors and she believed a ' verbal agreement ' had been made that her bench would be sponsored or paid for out of council funds			1
the memorial bench is for @entity9 ( pictured ) who tragically died in january 2013 from blood poisoning she also said she was led to believe she would not have to pay for the bench and is upset at now being told to pay up			1
@entity25 has admitted she can not remember exactly what was said at the time because she was taking anti-depressant drugs			0
she also said she has not received any paperwork other than the letter and a ' @entity76 , ' received last week , which said ' please return remittance slip			0
' @entity78 suggested in his letter that until the matter is resolved , it might be better for cllr @entity10 not to attend finance and audit committee meetings ' or at least any portion of a meeting which might have to discuss this matter			0
' he added : ' please understand that this is not an instruction from me			0
' this is only a suggestion from me as @entity93 and the decision as to whether you attend or not must be entirely yours			0
' @entity78 told cllr @entity10 that ' our many critics , especially those on @entity99 , could cause you considerable embarrassment if they felt you were participating in discussions in the @entity103 , about your personal financial circumstances			0
' i am sure that you understand that we all have to take extra care regarding our interests at this difficult time			0
' senior councillors have said the situation with the bench is ' puzzling ' and ' bizarre '			1
one councillor said he believed there had been a ' verbal agreement ' to provide a ' loan ' which would be repaid			1
he claimed cllr @entity10 had already repaid some of the money , but she denies paying anything			0
the senior councillor , who asked not to be named , said he had opposed providing a bench free of charge because ' it would set a precedent - if we put a bench for one , we would have to do it for everybody			2
' he said moves were being made by colleagues to have the debt ' written off ' - but that he would be opposing this			0
' i think that she should pay it back			0
i will be voting against writing the debt off			0
it 's a bizarre story , i find it puzzling			2
' a council meeting on thursday saw a decision to write off the £ 703 debt deferred			1
a finance committee has already voted that it should not be pursued			0
@entity140 has contacted @entity23 for a statement .			2
