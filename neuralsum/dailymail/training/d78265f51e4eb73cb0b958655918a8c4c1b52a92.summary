‘ it ’s less than one in 50 , but often we are talking about very , very minor errors			0
‘ i ’m not expert enough to say whether putting it in the eye at this high a dose would be likely to cause problems			0
‘ but clearly the dose of 0.5 per cent ( of chloramphenicol ) is designed for the eye , and the membrane of the eye is much more superficial than the ear , and you have got to be aware of how sensitive the eye is			0
