a year ago @entity0 went to @entity1 as a @entity3 hopeful with the burden of ‘ not since @entity5 ’ on his shoulders			1
he ended the 77 - year hoodoo , walked away with the crown , and so this year returns with a new challenge : a rematch with destiny and the tough task of keeping his title			2
in the @entity20 era only @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 have been able to follow a first @entity21 singles title with a second the following year			1
as a boxing fan , @entity0 was transfixed recently by another rematch which he hopes will help him			1
‘ i am a huge fan of boxing , so obviously i really enjoyed the @entity26 and @entity27 fights , ’ he says			1
sealed with a kiss : @entity0 celebrates winning @entity1 last year champion : @entity0 will start the defence of his @entity1 title against @entity33 @entity32 golden moment : @entity0 beat @entity34 ( right ) to win his first @entity1 title last year ‘ the training and mentality you need for boxing is n’t too far from what it ’s like to be a tennis player : you have to be physically strong but also mentally ; you ca n’t give anything away before you compete and both fighters did this perfectly			1
‘ [ in their first fight last year ] they kept everyone guessing right up to the point @entity27 knocked @entity26 down			1
it was a great advert for @entity3 boxing			1
i thought both boxers demonstrated incredible attitudes throughout , particularly in the run - up to the second fight at @entity56			2
‘ @entity26 had massively underestimated @entity27 in the first fight , a mistake that he learnt from , and returned stronger and better than we had ever seen before			1
learning from your mistakes is one of the most important things to do			2
‘ i really enjoyed the never - say - die attitude from @entity27 in securing the rematch , he fought hard to get @entity26 to fight him again , and although it did n’t quite work i think he gained a lot of people ’s respect , which is important in any sport			1
the most important message i will take away from those fights is to always have that attitude : fight till the bitter end and believe in yourself			2
’ practice : defending @entity1 champion @entity0 trained with new coach @entity77 on friday no scapegoat : @entity0 insists it wo n't be his new coach 's fault if he crashes out early taking a breather : @entity0 looks up at new coach @entity77 as she chats with him in between practice @entity0 , 27 , has heard plenty of stories about what it ’s like to defend a @entity1 title , not least from new coach @entity77 , who won the women ’s singles in @entity21 in 2006			1
‘ pure joy , ’ is how the @entity92 described it			2
‘ of course there is a goal of winning again and focusing on the game and what to do on the court , and how to behave , ’ she added			2
‘ but i feel first of all it ’s joy , and being so proud to be there to defend the title			1
’ @entity0 has heard that you return to @entity104 with a zip in your step , confidence pulsing through you and in the certain knowledge that you have what it takes to win the most prestigious event in the world			1
‘ it ’s a different feeling this year , ’ he says			2
‘ after spending so many years wanting to win and not , i always put a lot of pressure on myself heading into the @entity116			2
but after finally finding the breakthrough last year , i think i ’m definitely more relaxed			2
down and out : @entity27 is stopped by @entity26 in their second fight at @entity56 last month brutal battle : @entity26 and @entity27 gave everything in their two fights against each other ‘ this year i ’m just looking forward to going out and enjoying playing tennis as the defending champion , but they ’ll still be plenty of pressure from me to win ! ’ retaining his crown will be no easy task			1
eighteen men have won the @entity1 single ’s title for the first time in the open era of tennis since 1968 , and only four of them have followed up by retaining their title the next year			1
that quartet names are a roll call of some of the greatest players the game has known , all of them titans on grass in their pomp			2
@entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 have won 48 @entity148 singles titles between them , 22 of those at @entity1 ‘ i ’ve heard from a few of the guys that returning as defending champion is very special , ’ @entity0 says			1
‘ the @entity3 fans are always incredible and i ’m sure they will all be just as fired up this year			1
my mindset heading out onto @entity104 on the first day will still be the same as it has been every year			2
this tournament means everything to me , and i will be giving everything i can to go all the way again			2
’ pure joy : @entity77 celebrates after winning the women 's final at @entity1 in 2006 so intense , so tumultuous was last year ’s win , @entity0 barely took it in			1
he returned alone on the monday to @entity104 to let it sink in			0
‘ it was a funny feeling , ’ he says			0
‘ it was literally just me , so the contrast from the day before was incredible			0
‘ i could n’t remember much about the final game , so being able to just stand on the court , i was able to reflect on the day before , i even tried to replay a few of the points in my head			0
’ @entity77 takes over where @entity174 left off as @entity0 ’s coach			1
they could not be more different			0
asked if she too would sit in the players ’ box , unsmiling , shades on , stern and authoritarian , she can but laugh at the thought			0
then she sits up in the chair , pretending for a split second to be steely			0
‘ so i have to sit up straight ? ’ she asks			0
‘ it ’s tough to compare @entity174 and me			0
we are so different in every way			0
i do n’t know @entity174 very well			0
i know him through @entity0 ’s eyes			1
i do n’t think i will bring him the same as @entity174			0
which is good , because @entity174 brought him a lot and maybe i can bring him different things			0
’ suits you : @entity0 poses with former coach @entity174 after winning @entity1 last year dynamic duo : @entity0 hugs @entity174 in the players box after beating @entity34 last year dynamic duo : @entity174 and @entity0 proved a successful partnership , winning @entity1 and the @entity20 @entity174 , says @entity77 , made @entity0 more consistent , physically , against the biggest opponents			1
‘ and something else was helping him [ overcome ] the finals he lost in @entity148			0
and finally finding the switch to make it happen			0
’ her role , she says , will be more about psychology , at least immediately			0
‘ @entity0 ’s dna is not going to change drastically in the way he plays			1
on grass , playing the final in 2012 , winning the @entity209 , winning last year , he knows how to do this stuff			0
’ instead it seems she will help him remain calm on the court , on top of the demons that sometimes hurt his chances in his youth			0
she will also share the bad times she had at her own home slam , @entity219 , and how she felt crushed by pressure , and arguably under - achieved over the span of her career			0
‘ sharing my experience , sharing what i felt , these moments			0
sharing maybe the mistakes that i made , ’ is how she describes what she is @entity224 was interesting to share these feelings and maybe help him try to avoid [ negative thoughts ]			0
his career is moving on and he ’s learning many things			0
i should have done things a little bit differently at some points and hopefully he can learn from my mistakes			0
' three is the magic number : @entity0 has been seeded third for his defence of the @entity1 title			1

@entity3 no 1 looking to become fifth man in open era to defend title
@entity1 will be @entity0 's first major tournament with @entity77
@entity0 says he has learnt from the attitude of @entity26 and @entity27
