by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 05:04 est , 29 december 2013 @entity3 : 06:47 est , 29 december 2013 the number of @entity7 families who spend more than half their disposable income on debt repayments could treble by 2018 if interest rates rise faster than predicted , a leading think tank has warned			1
fearing that politicians are ignoring a looming crisis in household debt , think tank the @entity16 has urged banks to start checking on debtors now , in case they are caught off guard when the cost of borrowing goes up			1
some two million households could be driven to ' the edge of their means , ' the think tank said			1
household debt crisis : if interest rates rise faster than predicted , some two million @entity7 households who spend more than half their income on repayments could treble by 2018 chief executive @entity33 said : ‘ there is huge uncertainty about income growth and interest rates but under almost any plausible scenario there is going to be a big spike in the next parliament			1
‘ we could well be talking about this issue as much as we are currently discussing wages or energy bills			0
as yet there is little sign of the political or financial establishment giving this the priority it deserves			0
’ the projections , based on figures from the @entity53 ( @entity53 ) which show household debt rising faster than income , lay out several ways in which the number of people facing ' debt peril ' might rise from 2011 's total of 600,000			1
in a ' good growth scenario , ’ where interest rates stay low and income grows evenly across rich and poor - something @entity16 calls ‘ a marked departure from recent experience ’ - the number of people facing ' debt peril ' would still almost double to 1.1 million			1
but if interest rates go up and growth is slow or unequal , that figure would hit two million , rising from 5 per cent to 9 per cent in the bottom fifth of the income curve			2
@entity72 , senior economist at the @entity16 , said : ‘ even if we take a somewhat rosy view of how the economy will develop over the next few years the number of households severely exposed to debt looks as though it will double			2
‘ this is an alarming prospect , where a large number of families find themselves struggling with heavy debt commitments			0
‘ even small increases in the cost of borrowing could push a significant number of families over the edge and it 's most likely to happen to those with the lowest incomes , who are already spending the biggest share of their budget on repayments			0
’ mr @entity72 called the worst case scenario speculative but plausible , if the government 's help to buy scheme created a new housing bubble or spending increased among the affluent only , interest rates would be driven up without any accompanying recovery			0
in practice , the number would not actually hit two million , he said			0
instead , ‘ a high number of people ’ would simply default on their debts after a few months , possibly losing their homes and ‘ drop out of the statistics ’			0
big spenders : most of the @entity7 's household debt is composed of mortgages , with the rest taken up with credit cards , personal lending and payday loans most of the @entity7 's household debt is composed of mortgages , with the rest taken up by credit cards , personal lending and payday loans			1
since household consumption accounts for about 65 per cent of @entity126 , any drop in disposable income could have a huge effect on recovery			0
mr @entity72 said : ‘ in the worst case scenario you 've got two million households in a position where they are struggling to make ends meet , which means you 've got two million households that are n't contributing to any consumption			2
‘ worse , many of the people who are most over-exposed from pre-crisis debt are concentrated in the hands of particular banks and building societies , who could find themselves in a precarious situation			2
’ last year rent and mortgage arrears drove 5,000 people out of their homes , according to the @entity150			0
the right - leaning think tank , founded by @entity152 in 2004 , said there was £ 1.4 trillion of personal debt in the @entity7 with average household debt having doubled in a decade to £ 54,000 .			1
