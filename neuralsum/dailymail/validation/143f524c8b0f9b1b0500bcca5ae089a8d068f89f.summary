' it 's tough when it comes to dating profiles because we want someone who seems like an amazing person , but we also hopefully will have a relationship with this individual , so we want them to exist			0
' the team found most people in their study were drawn to individuals whose profiles were positive but not over-the - top glowing			0
more importantly , participants preferred people whose online persona could be clearly traced to a real person			0
