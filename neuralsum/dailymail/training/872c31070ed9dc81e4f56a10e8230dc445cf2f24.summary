state prosecutor @entity21 read the charge sheet in which he was accused of evading 3.5 million euros in taxes - on undeclared income of 33.5 million euros between 2003 and 2009			2
on trial : @entity3 is accused of eveding 3.5 million euros ( Â£ 3 million ) in taxes by concealing 33 million euros income through an undeclared @entity9 bank account admission : @entity3 reported himself to authorities in early 2013 , and part of the trial will be to determine whether he did that because he had become aware there was an investigation against him or for other reasons , which will affect the sentence he receives support : @entity4 fans hold up placards of @entity3 outside his trial for tax evasion @entity3 was once one of @entity15 's most respected names in football , winning the 1972 @entity45 with @entity4 and the 1974 @entity46 with @entity15 as a player before leading @entity4 to two @entity49 titles as a manager			1
but the man who went on to turn @entity4 into a sports and commercial success before his fall from grace , could be sentenced to between five and 10 years in jail if convicted of evading more than 1 million euros in taxes			1

what is unclear is whether he informed the tax office about his offence early enough or comprehensively enough to avoid jail			0
@entity6 legal experts say it appears unlikely he fulfilled those requirements			0

' the consequences of all this for me and my family have been a disaster , ' said @entity3 , and he had donated more than five million euros to charity in past years and paid more than 50 million euros in taxes in @entity15 , he said			2
' i 'm not a social parasite , ' he said in response to the criticism that by evading taxes he cheated other taxpayers			1
the case against @entity3 , and other celebrities caught or confessing to tax evasion , led thousands to preemptively pay back taxes in the hope of avoiding prosecution , and helped change the public 's perception of tax evasion as a misdemeanour to it being seen as a serious crime			2
@entity165 , a leading feminist , chancellor @entity168 's party treasurer @entity167 , @entity170 's culture minister @entity169 and former top journalist @entity171 have been in the public spotlight for tax evasion issues			0
