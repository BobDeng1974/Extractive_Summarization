but his behaviour changed after the @entity35 royal family , who run the private hospital , had promoted dr @entity37 to acting chief executive officer in 2005			2
as he gained more power , her colleague became a ‘ dictator and megalomaniac ’ who phoned her late at night and shouted at her , she claimed			1

’ her counsel , @entity49 , told deputy judge @entity50 that mrs @entity7 had initially tried to ‘ laugh off ’ his actions			1
accused : dr @entity37 is said to have made late night phone calls to mrs @entity7 in which he spoke about his sex life and shouted abuse at her but when dr @entity37 assumed the role of acting ceo , a picture emerged of ‘ over-familiarity , innuendo , on occasions inappropriate physical contact , personal and professional humiliation … veiled threats and blackmail			1
’ at one stage dr @entity37 sent mrs @entity7 a ‘ special @entity69 gift ’			1
when she opened it , she was shocked to find it contained nothing but male toiletries , and told her husband when she saw it : ‘ so this is his special gift ’			2
she later tried to convince herself that the ‘ odd ’ gift was an accident , with the present perhaps intended for a male colleague , but she finally concluded that it was a ‘ deliberate and offensive act ’			0

denial : @entity106 , which own @entity11 , pictured , say that mrs @entity7 's breakdown was caused by marriage difficulties and raising an autistic son he claimed she was nursing a grievance because dr @entity37 had earlier been appointed company secretary instead of her			1
mrs @entity7 said a colleague had told her dr @entity37 had opposed her appointment , but the prosecution suggested other members of the board had been behind the move			1
mr @entity100 said : ‘ you have constructed in your own mind that in some way dr @entity37 is to blame that he became company secretary and you did not			2
’ he added : ‘ you spent a long time at the hospital			0
you were a career woman			0
you had your children and you returned to work and work formed a big part of your life and you wanted that job			0
