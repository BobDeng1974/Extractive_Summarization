the best in the world ? for £ 5.136billion , the astronomical numbers from the latest tv deal , it would be easy to say that about the @entity5			1
but is it really ‘ the best ’ ? at this moment , i have to say no. we absolutely have the best football product in the business and that ’s why the fight between tv companies to secure the rights was ferocious			1
on the day the deal was announced , @entity16 and @entity17 conjured up a thrilling contest , advertising all that is good about the @entity5 , but , in terms of pure quality , i do n’t think we can make the boast of being the best			1
@entity25 players celebrate with a pile - on after @entity26 scored a late winner against @entity28 on wednesday @entity29 is congratulated by his @entity31 team - mates after scoring against @entity32 @entity33 ( right ) turns to applaud the fans after scoring for @entity35 against @entity36 @entity37 celebrates after scoring for @entity17 against @entity16 on tuesday night @entity38 ( centre ) celebrates with his @entity16 team - mates after scoring the winner against @entity17 with the money that has flooded in , our teams should be carrying all before them in @entity46			1
in the not - too - distant future , some clubs will be in a position where they will not only be able to get into bidding wars with @entity51 and @entity52 but actually trump them			2
at the minute , however , we do n’t have the strength and depth of other leagues on the continent and the resumption of both @entity46 competitions next week brings that sharply into focus			0
with the financial power @entity63 clubs have , we should be favourites to do a clean sweep			1
the @entity65 , in particular , is something we should be stamping our presence all over			1
that tournament gets criticised but i believe it is the real indicator of how strong a country ’s league is			1
@entity74 ’s performance in the last 15 years has , frankly , been awful			0
only @entity16 ( 2001 ) and @entity25 ( 2013 ) have lifted the trophy ; @entity76 ( 2006 ) and @entity77 ( 2010 ) are the others who have contested the final			2
@entity81 teams , in the same period , have provided six winners and three other finalists			0
@entity25 players celebrate after beating @entity86 in @entity87 to win the 2013 @entity65 @entity88 and @entity89 hold up the trophy after @entity16 won the @entity65 in @entity91 in 2001 @entity92 ( left ) and @entity88 pose for the cameras with the @entity65 trophy in 2001 the @entity96 players and staff celebrate after beating @entity86 in @entity98 to win the @entity65 last year it is the same in the @entity100			1
with @entity91 in the bottom three of the @entity103 , @entity101 only has one team ( @entity104 ) capable of winning it			2
with the threat from @entity107 and @entity108 also minimal , the path should be clear but , of our three remaining candidates , only @entity25 look capable of going all the way			0
so it throws up the question of how clubs are investing their riches			2
and that is one of my big concerns : recruitment			0
have these incredible figures put agents and players around the globe on alert that @entity74 is the place to come and make a killing ? this is not just a deal for @entity63 football			1
some will see it as a deal for world football but will our clubs now get kidded when they go looking for players ? only @entity25 have recruited well recently			1
can @entity16 , @entity17 or @entity31 say the same ? is it too easy for these clubs to say ‘ we ’ve got the money ’ rather than scouting properly ? do not confuse this for me saying clubs should only be buying @entity142 : i want to see clubs continue to buy stars such as @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 ; performers like @entity149 and @entity150 would be welcome additions in the future and we want the best managers here , too			1
@entity145 ( left ) in action for @entity25 against @entity156 at the @entity157 last month @entity158 's @entity146 ( right ) looks to put in the challenge on @entity161 's @entity160 on tuesday @entity147 ( centre ) skips away during @entity31 's match against @entity32 on wednesday my worry is we will see an influx of dross arriving , players who know they will get lavishly rewarded for not doing much but will block the development of young local talent			2
they are the most worrying transfers			0
clubs can not fall into a trap of thinking success will come just by throwing money around			2
i spoke to a respected figure who works in development football and he conducted a study of the top @entity5 clubs ’ use of players within their 25 - man squads ; essentially , there tends to be 14 or 15 players within each group — the mainstays — who play 75 per cent of all matches			1
we want the best players coming in to challenge them , the concern is the players who occupy the other eight to 10 places			0
we do n’t want players to come in and snuff out the chances of local kids at the club , just because they have cost money			0
they add nothing and stop progress			0
watching @entity203 and @entity37 in midweek put that into focus			0
both players have had spells out on loan and such moves are becoming increasingly crucial in a young player ’s education as they are competing against men for points and fighting to show they are good enough			0
with that experience , they should be given the chance to support the regulars			0
only rarely do we get young @entity63 stars such as @entity218 , @entity219 or @entity220 , who go straight into the team as a teenager			1
clubs have a duty to give those who have put 10 years or more in at an academy a proper opportunity to succeed			2
@entity16 's @entity203 ( right ) takes on @entity17 's @entity228 during the @entity5 clash @entity37 ( centre ) fires a long - range effort towards goal to net the equaliser for @entity17 at @entity234 @entity25 's @entity235 ( right ) looks towards @entity28 pair @entity236 and @entity237 one aspect that should be looked at accordingly is the ‘ homegrown ’ rule			1
it is a nonsense that players such as @entity243 and @entity235 , for instance , can be classed as being locally produced even though they were recruited from abroad			0
the added spin - off of that will help benefit the @entity74 team in the long term			0
i ’ve heard it said that the @entity5 has hindered @entity74 ’s performances in the last two decades but let ’s not kid ourselves on that — @entity74 were struggling at tournaments long before 1992			2
what we should not lose sight of , either , is how supporters should be treated and surely now is the time for clubs to give something back to those who have stood by them through thick and thin ? can clubs find a way of providing subsidies for away travel and agree that £ 20 for an away ticket is the top limit ? why ca n’t the 20 chairmen make that the fair price ? for the money they are going to earn , any fall in gate receipts would be minimal			2
they are all issues that , in time , will be addressed			0
the @entity5 is the best concept in football , one that we should be proud of			2
but is it the best in all areas ? no. not yet			0
@entity284 some games from childhood last a lifetime and the 1990 @entity288 semi-final between @entity16 and @entity290 is one that has stayed with me			1
i remember coming in from playing @entity293 football and being completely stunned that @entity16 could lose 4 - 3 to opponents like @entity290			1
it was a defeat that stripped @entity16 ’s aura of invincibility and , i felt , started the club ’s demise			2
there is no doubt @entity290 have been a bogey team for @entity16			1
they shattered @entity305 ’s hopes of bringing the title back to @entity234 and the effects of that 3 - 3 draw were still being felt all the way through to last november , when @entity16 folded at @entity310 and were beaten 3 - 1			1
@entity290 players and supporters celebrate during the @entity288 semi-final win against @entity16 in 1990 @entity314 is mobbed by his @entity290 team - mates after scoring the winner in the famous 4 - 3 victory only after that defeat were @entity16 able to start recovering and while they head into saturday night 's @entity288 fifth - round tie with an opportunity to really build some momentum , the squad will be conscious of the threat @entity314 ’s men pose			1
it is the tie of the weekend , as @entity290 will be aiming to inflict further misery on @entity16 and dreaming of the chance to repeat their achievements of 1990 and get back to @entity330			1
they can be difficult opposition when the home crowd get behind them			0
this match , however , is huge for @entity16			2
with their hopes of getting into the top four still delicately balanced and a tough @entity65 fixture against @entity340 looming , they can not afford to let the @entity288 slip away			1
they can not suffer at the hands of their bogeymen again			0
@entity345 celebrates after scoring the winner for @entity290 in their 3 - 1 win against @entity16 last november @entity16 manager @entity305 ( left ) walks towards the dressing room after the november defeat @entity16 players look dejected after throwing away a three - goal lead - and the title - at @entity310 last may this week i 'm looking forward to ... @entity357 's next press conference @entity31 's manager came in for criticism this week for how he handled some barbs from @entity362 after the sides drew 1 - 1 at @entity364			1
as soon as @entity366 started handing out sheets at his conference before the game with @entity32 you could hear people say ‘ he ’s lost it ’ , because it ’s not something you see a manager do every day			0
but i applauded him for standing up for his beliefs			0
it was also hilarious when he was passing around the sheets with his tactics on and came out with the line : ‘ give this to @entity362 ! ’			0
@entity383 turns up at his press conference on tuesday with a dossier @entity366 came armed with diagrams and stats to prove his point to the assembled media @entity362 ( left ) and @entity366 shake hands before sunday 's match between @entity392 and @entity31 how many of these press conferences do we see that are filled with endless cliches and quotes you have heard 100 times before ? full marks to @entity366 for standing up for himself and having a go back at one of his rivals			1
he did n’t overstep the mark , he just argued for what he believed in			0
@entity366 is not afraid to speak his mind and though he is still trying to find a way to get @entity31 playing dynamic football , he has added to our game with his pre- and post-match observations and there was nothing wrong with the way he answered back to @entity362			0
long may it continue .			0

the @entity5 's new tv rights deal is worth £ 5.136billion
the @entity63 league may be thrilling but it is not the best in the world
@entity63 clubs should be stamping their presence over the @entity65
the competition is a real indicator of how strong a country 's league is
one aspect that should be looked at is the ' home grown ' rule
@entity290 have been a bogey team for @entity16
@entity305 ' side can not afford to let the @entity288 slip away
