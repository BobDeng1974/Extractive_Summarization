@entity0 was not just the toast of the @entity3 dressing room but also the internet as virals flooded social media after @entity8 's new forward bagged a brace against @entity10			1
web jokesters were quick to remind @entity12 and @entity13 what they have lost when @entity0 found the net in the 58th minute and fourth minute of time added on in @entity17 to kickstart @entity3 's @entity19 qualifying campaign against their most fancied opponent			2
in a mix of new and rehashed old favourites , @entity0 is superimposed holding the 1966 @entity23 aloft , on the undershirt of @entity25 and on a £ 10 note - a graphic statement that he is apparently 10 times as good a player as his team - mate @entity28			0
@entity31 's savvy £ 16million signing of the former @entity32 late in the summer transfer window also get an unsurprising airing			0

@entity0 scored twice for @entity3 against @entity10 in @entity17
