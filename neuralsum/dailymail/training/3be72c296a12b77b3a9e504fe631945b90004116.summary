by @entity0 horrified : @entity1 says children around the country are being exposed to school texts which contain foul language and explicit material a mother - of - two who was abused on @entity8 for suggesting her daughter should not be studying a foul - mouthed play as called for age restrictions on school books			1
@entity1 , a vicar 's wife , was horrified when her 14 - year - old daughter brought home the gritty drama @entity17 , which contains 218 uses of the f - word and ten of the c - word – as part of her gcse drama course			1
she expressed her dismay on the parenting forum by setting up a feed , but deleted it after teachers responded aggressively			0
the former social worker , 52 , believes the use of the sexually explicit play , which also touches on self - harm and violence , shows some teachers do not know the difference between right and wrong and proves that ' anything can end up in the classroom '			1
she also suggests that if there are age restrictions on films and a watershed on television , there should be similar controls at school			1
mrs @entity1 told @entity45 : ' the play is full of explicit language , including sexual content			1
it is shocking that material like this is being fed into young people without parents knowing			0
' if there are ratings in films and a watershed in tv , there is a sense there needs to be similar restrictions in schools			1
' i would n't let my daughter watch a 15 certificate film at home			1
if it is n't acceptable somewhere else , why is it acceptable at school			1
' the play , which was written by @entity72 and is set in a tough @entity74 secondary school , was broadcast on the @entity75 in 2011 after the watershed			1
it is ridden with racial abuse and at one point a teacher is called ' batty ' and one of the main characters says ' suck my * * * * ' to a schoolgirl			0
mrs @entity1 's daughter studied the play at @entity86 in @entity87 for two terms as part of her gcse drama course			1
one @entity8 user , who claimed to be a teacher , responded : ‘ censorship – that ’s what you want			1
so you can impose your middle - @entity97 , white , middle - class values on a world that no longer exists			1
‘ as a teacher , i will say very bluntly how sick and f * * * * * * tired i am of parents like you who think they are experts on all f * * * * * * areas of the curriculum			0
’ another said : ‘ this really , really p * * * * * me off			0
i teach and have had half - * * * ed complaints from parents on occasion			2
what really boils my p * * * is people having opinions about things they have n’t even read and certainly do n’t understand			0
’ she says that she would not let her daughter watch a 15 certificate film at home , so questions why she is subjected to swearing and sexual content at school mrs @entity1 added : ' it has n't put me off			1
it has shown what some teachers are like , it has made me more determined to challenge it			0
' the play is being used all over the country			2
to me now i have seen its the tip of the iceberg and its not acceptable			0
' there is a problem here			0
in schools you expect children to be safeguarded and this is going on without a parent 's knowledge			0
' there needs to be some controls			0
if there are no limits , how far could you go ? @entity86 in @entity87 claims that mrs @entity1 is the only parent to have complained about the use of the play at the school ' there are some teachers that have no sense of right and wrong and are prepared to use these materials			1
this stuff could be potentially damaging			0
' anything can end up in a classroom			0
an 11 year - old could pick up a library book with this sort of material in			2
' we are not talking about a few swear words			0
if you remove the offensive language , the foundation of the play is for it to be as shocking and offensive as it can			2
' mrs @entity1 gave an extract of the play to @entity169 in a bid to highlight the explicit content and asked ' would you read this '			1
reply : a letter from the acting headteacher of @entity86 to mrs @entity1 , justifying the use of the play support : a letter from education secretary @entity179 to mrs @entity1 's mp @entity169			1
he says : ' as a father myself , however , i do share mrs @entity1 's concern ' a letter from the @entity185 says the school have the final say over what texts they study he told her there was an inconsistency in the policy and he subsequently passed the letter on to @entity179 the acting headteacher , @entity193 , wrote a long letter back to mrs @entity1 , justifying the use of the play , suggesting she was the only parent to have complained			1
' he compared it to @entity197 and @entity198			0
the problem with @entity17 is it is current and you can be drawn in to the reality			1
' i have also been in contact with a father - of - three in @entity206			2
he responded to the letter because he had an issue with sexually explicit language in his daughter 's library book			2
' she said the old headteacher , who had to retire due to ill health , would have been horrified and a teacher at another school ' could n't believe it			1
' ' the few parents i have spoken to were horrified this was going on			2
i have now set up a petition			0
' when deciding on what play 's pupils should study , schools can choose from a selection of texts set out by exam boards			2
@entity229 , a body who runs @entity233 drama courses , offers titles by playwrights such as @entity197 and @entity236 , but do not recommend @entity17			1
@entity237 from the @entity238 said : ' children at school should receive the same protection as that provided by the tv 9 o'clock " watershed "			2
she has written to education secretary @entity179 and has started a petition to introduce age restrictions on school texts ' the @entity75 's broadcasting of " @entity17 " back in 2011 commenced at 9.45 pm			1
the plays excessive use of foul language and disturbing themes that include racism , bullying , self - harm and suicide were judged by the @entity75 as unsuitable for youngsters			2
' @entity260 , there are disturbing themes in @entity197 and , even , in many fairy tales but it is the			0
immediacy of " @entity17 " that causes concern			1
i am not aware that @entity197 wrote a play about a @entity74 comprehensive school			1
' ' in essence , we are dealing here with a child protection issue and the protection rules that apply to tv and cinema should apply in the classroom			0
a @entity185 spokesman said : ' we expect schools to alert parents before a text of this nature is taught and to give parents the option of withdrawing their children from these classes			0
any investigation would examine whether the school followed these steps			2
' @entity289 from the @entity290 added : ' it is a matter for great concern that any school should consider a text littered with foul language appropriate for classroom use			2
no family newspaper could publish extracts from this play and neither could it be screened before the watershed			2
' requiring pupils to take offensive words on their lips in drama lessons will do nothing to encourage pupils to use appropriate language in a polite , thoughtful and constructive way			2
rather , it will tend to break down their inhibitions and normalise the concentrated use of foul speech			0
' the government ought to be able to trust teachers to select appropriate texts for pupils to study in its schools			0
' however , the fact that some teachers have become so insensitised that they appear to consider nothing off - limits suggests that further action is required			1
' the play , written by @entity325 , is set in a tough @entity74 secondary school @entity17 , written by @entity325 , is set in a tough @entity74 secondary school			1
it concerns a white teacher who is trying to protect a black student from being expelled			0
@entity330 , a teacher is pushed to the ground by a black student named @entity334 when she tries to intervene in a fight			0
ignoring the advice of @entity337 , her daughter , who suggests she should report the incident , @entity330 resists telling the headmaster , @entity341 , for fear of ruining @entity334 's future			1
knowing @entity334 's history , the teacher feels sorry for @entity334			0
finally persuaded , the next day she mentions the incident to @entity341 who is suspicious of why she has waited so long			0
there is racial abuse and a teacher is called ' batty ' , slang for gay and one of the main characters snarls at a schoolgirl : ' suck my * * * *			0
' in previous controversies , some have argued that the exam or educational use of @entity363 's great modern play @entity364			0
it surrounds a @entity367 - like school shooting at a @entity369 academy , with many suggesting it could encourage vulnerable students to mimic the actions			1
@entity17 is part of a selection of plays certain schools can study during gcse and a-levels			1
teachers can choose from a number of titles by playwrights such as @entity197 , @entity383 and @entity236 , but many opt for the gritty drama instead .			0
