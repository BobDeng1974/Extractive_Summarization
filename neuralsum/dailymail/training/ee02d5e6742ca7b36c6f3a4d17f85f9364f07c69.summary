supermarkets have begun a new fuel price war after @entity2 's announced it will slash the cost of diesel and petrol by up to 5p a litre from tomorrow			1
@entity7 quickly followed suit , announcing it will also cut 1p from the price of petrol and 2p from the price of diesel from tomorrow , putting the pressure on other big retailers such as @entity14 and @entity15			1
the change in price reflects a drop in the price of wholesale crude oil , and a strengthening of the pound following a no vote in the @entity25 referendum			1
' this cut will take us to a new low , the likes of which we have n’t seen since late 2010 , early 2011 when the price of petrol and diesel unfortunately jumped by 10p a litre in just a few months			2
' since the @entity25 referendum the pound has rallied against the dollar which has created a much - appreciated downward pressure on fuel prices which are traded in dollars			1
' it ’s great news for motorists that this is being swiftly passed on by retailers at the pumps			0
' @entity54 spokesman @entity53 said : ' a 5p cut in the price of petrol , lopping £ 2.50 off the cost of filling a typical fuel tank , will be particularly welcome as families get back to school runs			0
' inflation fell 1.5 per cent on the consumer price index last month , driven largely by cuts to fuel and food prices in the supermarkets , easing the pressure on squeezed household budgets the fresh round of price cuts will also come as more good news to chancellor @entity71			2
earlier this month it was revealed that inflation dropped 1.5 per cent to a four and a half year low , thanks in large part to supermarket price wars on food and fuel			1
it means inflation , measured on the consumer price index ( @entity80 ) , has been below its target of 2 per cent for eight months in a row - the longest run since before the recession in 2005			0
as well as being good news for shoppers , the news may also help those with mortgages and other loans , as it eases pressure on the @entity93 to raise interest rates			0
the @entity93 has set rates at the historic low of 0.5 per cent for more than five years , and analysis believed they may have increased that to 0.75 in february next year			0
however , with inflation continuing to fall , that may now be delayed until the second financial quarter of next year , according to @entity101 .			0

@entity7 also announces it is cutting petrol by 1p a litre and diesel by 2p a litre
cuts come after pound rallied following no vote in @entity25 referendum
price war will further drive down inflation which is already at a four year low
