@entity0 is investing further in the underground cable network by backing a project that will span the @entity3			1
called faster , the $ 300 million ( £ 178 million ) scheme will connect @entity6 to the west coast of the @entity8			1
the cable will stretch 5,000 miles ( 8,000km ) under the ocean , and will then link up with local cable systems already in place			1
called faster , the project will connect @entity6 to the west coast of the @entity8			1
the cable will stretch 5,000 miles ( 8,000 km ) under the ocean , at depths of around 7,000 miles ( 11,300 km ) , and will then link up with local cable systems already in place			1
faster is expected to be complete by @entity20 a submarine communications cable is a cable laid on the sea bed between land - based stations			2
it is laid by specially designed ships that can carry thousands of miles of coiled cable in their holds and can lay it as it travels across the ocean			1
the first commercial cables were laid in 1850 to send telegraphy traffic			0
since then the cables have been used to send telephone traffic , and most recently data traffic			0
many of the modern cables are made of fibre optic			0
trial cables were laid in 1842 in @entity42 harbour and were insulated with tarred hemp and rubber			0
nowadays , cables are protected using polyethylene			0
traditionally the cables were owned by service providers , yet websites have also started buying submarine cables to control their networks including @entity0 and @entity52			2
faster is expected to be completed by @entity20			2
on the @entity6 side , the cable will land at @entity56 and @entity57 and is designed to improve the network further into @entity59			1
while on the @entity8 side , the cable will connect networks in @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , and @entity66			1
‘ at @entity0 we want our products to be fast and reliable , and that requires a great network infrastructure , whether it 's for the more than a billion @entity73 users or developers building products on @entity76 , ’ said @entity67 , senior vice president of technical infrastructure at @entity0			2
‘ and sometimes the fastest path requires going through an ocean			0
' that ’s why we ’re investing in @entity53 , a new undersea cable that will connect major @entity82 cities in the @entity8 to two coastal locations in @entity6 with a design capacity of 60 terabits per second			1
’ that ’s ten million times faster than a household cable modem			1
@entity0 has previously invested in other cable projects , including @entity88 in 2008 , which also joined @entity6 to the @entity8 , and the @entity89 ( @entity90 ) in 2011			1
this interactive map plots the location of all the underwater submarine cables across the world			0
it was created by @entity97 - based @entity96 the @entity90 links eight points in @entity59 including @entity56 in @entity6 , @entity99 in @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , the @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , and @entity109 , @entity110			1
@entity0 has previously invested in other cable projects , including unity in 2008 , and the @entity89 ( @entity90 ) in 2011 ( pictured ) in addition to @entity0 , the @entity53 project has been backed by @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , and @entity119			2
mr. @entity120 , the chairman of the @entity53 executive committee , said : ' faster is one of a few hundred submarine telecommunications cables connecting various parts of the world			0
' these cables collectively form an important infrastructure that helps run global @entity129 and communications			2
‘ the @entity53 cable system has the largest design capacity ever built on the @entity133 , which is one of the longest routes in the world			0
‘ the agreement announced today will benefit all users of the global @entity129			0
' almost 95 per cent of the internet used everyday is carried between countries through two - inch ( 50mm ) thick lines			0
in 2006 , submarine cables carried just one per cent of traffic - an increase of 94 per cent in just eight years , according to official figures from the @entity147			0
since 2012 , the number of submarine cables have almost doubled from 150 to 285 .			0

the $ 300 million ( £ 178 million ) global project is called faster
it will involve laying cable 5,000 miles ( 8,000 km ) under the ocean
the cable will run from the west coast of the @entity8 and @entity6 at depths of around 7,000 miles ( 11,200 km )
it will link up with local cable systems already in place in the @entity8 and @entity6
this will improve the network beyond @entity6 and into @entity59
on the @entity8 side , the cable will connect networks in @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , and @entity66
