by @entity0 and @entity1 an alien planet spotted by @entity5 's kepler space telescope is the best candidate yet for an @entity8 - like world beyond our solar system , scientists claim			1
the planet - whose existence is yet to be positively confirmed			0
has a radius that is just 1.5 times that of our own and orbits in the ' habitable zone ' of a star similar to our own @entity18 that means the planet would likely have a similar amount of gravity as @entity8 and liquid water could exist on its surface - making it a prime candidate to host alien life			1
distant worlds : an artist 's impression of @entity8 - like exoplanets this artist 's illustration represents the variety of planets being detected by @entity5 's @entity37 spacecraft : @entity5 astronomers have revealed the discovery of a potential planet that could be the closest to @entity8 yet found ' this was very exciting because it 's our fist habitable - zone super earth around a sun - type star , ' said @entity5 astronomer @entity46 at the annual meeting of the @entity48 this week			1
the announcement comes after it was revealed at the same meeting that analysis of data from @entity37 had shown there are 17billion planets in the galaxy that are @entity8 - like in size			1
the possible planet is called @entity59 - with the initial trio of letters standing for @entity62 , a prefix given to all planetary candidates found by @entity65 until their existence is confirmed			2
dr @entity46 said the find had the potential to be the closest so far to an @entity8 - twin beyond the solar system			2
it orbits a g - type star that is only slightly cooler than our own @entity18 , she said			0
' previously the ones we saw were orbiting other types of stars , ' she was quoted as saying by @entity79			0
an artist 's impression of @entity82 , one of the planets identified by the @entity37 space telescope mission analysis of @entity65 's data indicates that the object takes 242 days to orbit its star , from which it is about three quarters as distant as the @entity8 is from the @entity18 astrophysicist @entity92 , of the @entity93 in @entity94 , told @entity79 that the find was a ' big deal '			1
' it 's definitely a good candidate for life , ' he said			0
@entity99 of the @entity100 announced the discovery of the planet along with a batch of 461 new planet candidates spotted by @entity37 since february last year			2
latest findings released by @entity5 show that since february last year there have been 461 potential new planets discovered			1
these bring the total number of potential planets that have been identified by the @entity37 mission to 2,740 and they orbit 2,036 stars			1
a breakdown by size of potential planets identified by the @entity37 mission			1
among the most dramatic increases is in the number of @entity8 - sized and super @entity8 - sized planets			1
discoveries of @entity8 - sized planets increased by 43 per cent while those of super-earths rose by 21 per cent			1
@entity123 planetary astronomer @entity122 said : ' we are showing that there is about one planet per star , and that gives us a total of about a hundred billion planets throughout our galaxy			0
' the vast majority of those planets are orbiting stars that are very much different from our sun. ' several of the planets being identified are in the same solar system , just as @entity8 is one of eight planets orbiting the @entity18 ' the large number of multi-candidate systems being found by @entity37 implies that a substantial fraction of exoplanets reside in flat multi-planet systems , " said @entity140 , planetary scientist at @entity141			1
' this is consistent with what we know about our own planetary neighborhood			0
' the kepler space telescope was launched by @entity5 in 2009 with the intention of finding @entity8 - like planets			1
it pinpoints potential new planets by measuring the dimming of starlight as planets pass between stars and the telescope			0
not all dimming is caused by planets and it is only once dimming has been observed three times that it is formally attributed to a potential planet			2
further measurements and observations are required to confirm the identification			0
in the last year the number of confirmed planets pinpointed by @entity37 has risen from 33 to 105			0
newborn star : @entity173 110 is a geyser of hot gas from a newborn star that splashes up against and ricochets off the dense core of a cloud of molecular hydrogen far far away : lying 45 million light - years away from @entity8 in the southern constellation of @entity182 , a bright star - forming ring that surrounds the heart of the barred spiral galaxy cosmic dance : about 300 million light - years away , only four of these five galaxies are actually locked in a cosmic dance of repeated close encounters @entity191 of the @entity192 presented the latest @entity37 findings at a meeting of the @entity48 in @entity195 , @entity196 , on monday			2
the @entity197 has accepted a paper detailing the research for publication			0
@entity99 , a scientist at the @entity100 which researches signs off extra-terrestrial intelligence , said that 58 planets found so far are believed to be in their host stars ' habitable zones			0
that means that any water on them has a chance of being in liquid form because the region is close enough to the star to be warm enough for ice to melt but not so close that it all evaporates			0
near death : a new photo of @entity219 system 's largest star suffering a near - death experience before it goes supernova in the near future planets orbiting close to their suns are likely to be infernos while planets in distant orbits are likely to be icy , he said			2
@entity99 also analyzed the latest @entity37 data			0
the @entity37 launched on march 7 , 2009 , and has been active for 3 years , 10 months and 1 day as of january 8 , 2013			0
the space observatory was named in honor of the 17th - century @entity233 astronomer @entity65			0
@entity37 is part of @entity5 's @entity235 which runs relatively low - cost scientific research missions			2
the observatory â€™s mission going forward is to find and document @entity8 - sized planets at greater distances			1
the more planets discovered with @entity8 - like orbits in their habitable zones , the greater the chances of extra-terrestrial life , scientists say			1
sun - like star : located just beyond the tip of the tail of the constellation of @entity252 , this butterfly - shaped cloud of glowing gas and dust is the wreckage of a star similar to the @entity18 distorted galaxies : @entity259 are a pair of distorted colliding spiral galaxies about 70 million light - years away , in the constellation of @entity263 cosmic collision : the result of a cosmic collision where a smaller galaxy plunged right through the heart of a larger one and shot out the other side			2

potential planet @entity59 has a radius of 1.5 times that of @entity8
it orbits in its star 's habitable zone - meaning it could host liquid water
@entity5 believes almost every sun - like star could have at least one planet
461 potential planets identified by the @entity37 mission since february 2012
dramatic increase in number of @entity8 - sized planets
