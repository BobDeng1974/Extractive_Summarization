creative mother : @entity3 ( pictured with her son , @entity26 , dressed in a @entity27 ) has developed a new design of baby grow that does not include traditional leg poppers , which she found ' difficult ' to do up innovative : instead , her design , dubbed the @entity15 , features plastic - moulded zips on each leg ( pictured ) , with concealed flaps to protect the infant 's limbs			1
the suit also includes wide arms and non-slip soles ' easy - to - use ' : while the suit ( pictured ) can be fully opened ' so that it is easy to dress little ones ' , its zips also allow parents to undress only their child 's lower half during nappy changes , mrs @entity3 told @entity47 while the suit can be fully opened ' so that it is easy to dress little ones ' , its zips also allow parents to undress only their child 's lower half during nappy changes , mrs @entity3 told @entity47			1
' the design means that the baby 's top half stays nice and warm , ' she said			2
' it 's an innovative baby grow that is easy , practical , and hassle - free to put on , take off , and open for nappy changes			1
' and despite mrs @entity3 having launched her @entity15 range only last year , it has already become a great success with @entity63 parents , with many deeming it an ' easy - to - use ' and ' thoughtful ' innovation			1
the mother said she was first inspired to create the @entity15 - which is now available in three star designs ( red - and - white , grey and white ) - after struggling to do up her baby son @entity26 's baby grow			1
' our second child was born and we still could n't do up his baby grows , ' said mrs @entity3 , who lives with her son , daughter , @entity77 , and husband , @entity79 , in an old @entity81 house in the capital			2
' frustrated at the fiddly design on most , @entity79 and i decided to design our own , parent - friendly one			0
we replaced leg poppers with a zip up each leg			2
then we fitted a fabric flap inside the @entity91 zips			0

@entity97 , a red - and - white star version of the @entity15 with zips on the legs , compared to a normal baby grow with leg poppers , right son : the mother said she was first inspired to create the @entity15 - now available in three star designs ( red - and - white , grey and white ) - after struggling to do up her baby son @entity26 's ( pictured today ) baby grow ' this ensures the zips never have any contact with baby 's ' legs and will not pinch the skin when done up			1
' she added : the @entity15 took us a year to design , and getting this flap right was laborious			0
' another flap on the baby grow 's front ' prevents the baby from playing with the zips , and means that when a parent is carrying their child , the zips wo n't dig into the carrier 's skin ' , said mrs @entity128			1
the @entity15 , which is produced in a @entity63 factory that mrs @entity3 visits on an almost daily basis , was perfected after ' many , many prototypes ' , all of which the mother tried out on her two children			0
' the result is the easiest , most straightforward babygrow to put on - even in the middle of the night , she said			0
' parenthood is hard enough without having to struggle with complicated clothes			0
