by @entity0 published : 22:19 est , 26 september 2013 updated : 22:19 est , 26 september 2013 glamorous cigarette packaging tempts young people who have never smoked to take up the habit , research suggests			1
a @entity6 funded study found youngsters preferred novelty packaging to plain packs			2
it comes after research earlier this month from the same department at the @entity12 found that putting graphic warnings on the back of cigarette packs had little impact on teen smokers			1
glamorous cigarette packaging tempts young people who have never smoked to take up the habit while plain packets deter them , research suggests that study found that teenagers ' ability to recall images depicting diseased lungs , rotten teeth and neck cancer , was less than 10 per cent , while three written warnings on the back of packs with no supporting images were recalled by less than one per cent of more than 1,000 teenagers			1
the new research , published in the journal @entity34 , examined the reactions of 1,025 @entity37 children aged 11 to 16 who had never tried smoking			1
they were given three different types of cigarette packs : regular , novelty and plain , standardised packs			2
novelty packs included those with an unusual shape , colour or system of opening , while standardised packs were brown with all branding removed apart from a brand name			0
researchers found that children preferred the colourful and novelty packs from leading manufacturers			0
they included @entity58 's slim pack shape , the @entity60 pack which opens at the side in the style of a @entity63 lighter , and @entity65 's bright pink pack			1
children who liked these packs were the same children who said they were more tempted to smoke , the study also found			0
in one example , those receptive to the @entity58 pack were more than four times as likely to be susceptible to smoking than those who were not receptive to this pack			2
less than 10 per cent of teenagers can recall the graphic pictures on cigarette packets in contrast , plain , standardised packaging reduced the appeal of smoking to the youngsters			1
in july , the government denied claims it had caved in to the tobacco industry after it put plans to introduce plain cigarette packaging on hold			0
a decision has been delayed so more time can be spent examining how similar plans are working in @entity91			0
@entity6 said the delay meant the ‘ tobacco industry is reaping the benefits of slickly designed packs that help to recruit new smokers ’			0
almost 570 children under - 16 start smoking in the @entity37 every day			1
dr @entity99 , @entity6 's chief executive , said : ‘ this study provides further evidence that the more attractive the tobacco packaging , the more likely children are to be tempted to light up their first cigarette - the first step to a deadly addiction which will kill half of them if they become long - term smokers			2
‘ the government must protect children from the lure of sophisticated marketing and show its priority is the health of young people , not the profits of the tobacco industry			1
‘ we urge the government to introduce plain , standardised tobacco packaging to reduce the number of young people who take up smoking			1
’ professor @entity125 , @entity6 's social marketing expert at the @entity12 , said : ‘ this research continues to build the case to protect vulnerable children from the might of the tobacco industry 's marketing			0
‘ the @entity37 must follow the lead of @entity91 and introduce plain , standardised packs as soon as possible			2
‘ meanwhile we must n't overlook the likelihood of the tobacco industry to seek new marketing opportunities within the pack , and to develop soft looking and special coatings to sex - up packs			0
‘ the tobacco industry is desperately turning to any measures available to peddle its products and secure profits from the smokers of the future			0
‘ we must act now to de-glamorise this deadly habit			0

young people prefer novelty cigarette packets to plain ones
only 10 *%* of teenagers can recall graphic images and warnings on packets
