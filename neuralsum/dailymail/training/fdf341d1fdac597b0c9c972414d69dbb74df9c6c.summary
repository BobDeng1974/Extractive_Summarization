@entity1 mp @entity0 yesterday warmly greeted migrants arriving from @entity3 and @entity4 – before calling for a referendum on free movement within the @entity7			1
mr @entity0 , the influential chairman of the @entity8 , said the @entity10 people needed to decide if the rules which allowed free - flowing migration across the continent should be changed			1
his comments came as controls on migrants from the two impoverished @entity18 countries lapsed at midnight on @entity19			0
at the end of the day it has to be a referendum			0
’ he told @entity34 : ‘ it needs to be part of negotiations for a reformed @entity7 , because freedom of movement is very important			1
‘ it ’s one of the cornerstones of the @entity7 and we need to have a proper discussion , and that means at the end of the day the @entity10 people have to make that decision			1
’ from yesterday , citizens of both @entity3 and @entity4 could move freely to @entity10 and have full access to jobs in this country			1
the reluctant @entity3 roped in for the greater glory of @entity0 looked as baffled as all the rest of us @entity1 mp @entity0 turned up at @entity27 this week to greet @entity3 in the arrivals lounge pleased to be here : mr @entity53 told the @entity1 politician that it was his first visit to @entity10 and that he was to work in a @entity57 car wash so he could send money back to his family this has prompted fears of a rush of migrants similar to that seen in 2004 , when eight @entity18 countries joined the @entity7			1
critics have warned a new surge in migrant numbers will put further pressure on hard - pressed public services , including schools and hospitals			0
they have also questioned whether more workers from abroad are needed at a time of high youth unemployment in the @entity10			1
ministers have refused to predict how many new arrivals will come – but have downplayed suggestions of a huge increase			0
mr @entity0 was joined by a senior committee member , @entity81 @entity80 , at @entity27			1
touchdown : passengers arrived in the @entity10 on board a @entity85 operated airliner , flight number @entity87 from @entity89 in @entity3 ( pictured ) new arrivals : some of the @entity3 on board said they were here to work and send money back home while others were already settled here and returning after @entity97 unclear picture : the government has not revealed estimates about how many @entity3 or @entity4 would arrive in the @entity10 from now onwards @entity4 arriving at @entity101 fron @entity102			1
@entity103 with her friend @entity104 who can now work in the @entity10 new arrivals : @entity106 with his wife @entity107 who can now work in the @entity10 they met @entity25 , 30 , who said he planned to initially wash cars in @entity10 , before moving into construction			1
‘ i do n’t come to rob your country			2
i come to work and then go home , ’ he said			2
medic : 35 - year - old @entity115 is an emergency doctor back in @entity3 who had come to the @entity10 to work in a hospital near @entity57 ‘ i do n’t want to stay here			1
i want to renovate my home and to make a good life in @entity3 because it ’s much easier to live in @entity3 because it ’s not expensive			2
’ mr @entity80 warned that an increase in @entity3 and @entity4 numbers could mean @entity122 miss their immigration target			2
@entity124 has pledged to cut net migration – the number migration adds to the population each year – from around 250,000 a year in 2010 to below 100,000 by 2015			0
currently it stands at 182,000			0
mr @entity80 said : ‘ i ’m here this morning because my party – the @entity81 – made a promise that we would cut immigration from hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands a year			2
' and my concern is that if we do see large numbers coming from @entity3 and @entity4 then that could knock us off that target and the promise we made to the electorate			2
‘ i think it ’s essential we meet that promise and control immigration			0
' i think we really need to judge whether in order to do that will require us to leave the @entity7 and to control our own borders			0
‘ ultimately i think that ’s the choice that the country will face in a referendum			0
’ mr @entity124 refused demands from 90 @entity81 backbenchers for the controls to be extended for a further three years			0
a @entity150 poll found that 80 per cent of the public favoured extending the controls , and a majority backed the move even if it would leave @entity10 facing extensive fines			0
the prime minister has pledged a referendum on @entity7 membership by 2017 if the @entity122 are in power , and is the only party leader to promise a vote			1
new arrivals : fellow member of the @entity8 , @entity81 @entity80 was also there to meet the 7.40am flight from @entity89 immigration minister @entity166 said the transitional controls were kept for the ‘ longest extent possible ’			0
he added : ‘ if you ’re here from the @entity7 and not working , not studying , not self - sufficient then we can remove you and you wo n’t be able to come back for at least a year			2
‘ i think those changes will make sure people are coming here for the right reasons , to work and to contribute and not to claim from our benefits system			0

@entity1 mp even bought some a coffee to find out why they are here
@entity3 @entity53 told him he would send his cash back home
' i do *n't* come to rob your country . i work and then go home , ' he said
mr @entity0 says @entity10 should hold referendum on number of @entity7 migrants
companies *advertise* *5,000* jobs to *recruit* @entity3 workers
adverts promise cash daily and say command of @entity202 ' *unnecessary* '
today *4,896* jobs *advertise*d in @entity202 , but less than 150 in rest of @entity10
