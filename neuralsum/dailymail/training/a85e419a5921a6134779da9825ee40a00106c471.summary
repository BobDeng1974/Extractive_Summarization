by @entity0 published : 11:11 est , 30 august 2013 updated : 12:32 est , 30 august 2013 some people struggle to pull off a sultry wink at the right moment , or , worse still , use them willy nilly at inappropriate times			0
but some animals , it seems , have no problem flashing a wink when they choose			2
whether or not they are communicating with their single - blinks , however , remains to be seen			2
trying to communicate ? the thought of a giant polar bear trying to communicate with a sultry wink will probably fill you with dread			0
but one photographer finds it hard not to wonder if there 's any meaning in it but for one photographer who has collected a plethora of pictures of winking animals , it 's difficult not to wonder if there 's any meaning in it			1
snapper and @entity33 tour guide @entity31 might be forgiven for thinking the animal kingdom are trying tell him something with a tally of @entity38 creatures giving him the wink			2
they include a polar bear , a cheetah cub and an owl appearing to be passing on a conspiratorial wink			0
squint or wink ? given the sun is shining directly at this lion , it 's quite likely he 's simply squinting , but there 's always the chance he 's communicating through winking ' it would be easy to be anthropomorphic about this but i am beginning to think this is not co-incidence , ' said photographer @entity31 the winking cheetah was snapped while chasing a @entity61 's gazelle fawn @entity31 , from @entity62 , said : ' i have seen many extraordinary moments in the wildlife world from lion kills to drinking jaguars and cheetah and polar bear hunts to tiny tiger cubs			1
' however in the last two years i seemingly have been pursued by winking animals			1
' it would be easy to be anthropomorphic about this but i am beginning to think this is not co-incidence			0
even cheetah cubs appear to be able to flash a perfect wink ' it is almost as if they are checking that i have my camera settings correct , they then give me a conspiratorial wink as if to say ' you are doing it right and behaving sensitively towards me , here 's your reward '			0
' this is obviously humanising nonsense , but it does add a quirky edge to the photographs			1
@entity91 winkers , the lot of them			0
' @entity33 tour guide @entity31 might be forgiven for thinking the animal kingdom are trying tell him something with a tally of @entity38 creatures giving him the wink , including this owl @entity91 winkers : the wildlife photographer says it is ' obviously humanising nonsense , but it does add a quirky edge to the photographs ' @entity31 has been leading photographic safaris and expeditions for @entity33 for many years and was named @entity111 in this month 's @entity114 travel reader 's awards .			1

@entity31 recently photographed several winking animals in his work
he even questioned if the animals were trying to communicate with him
but came to the conclusion it was ' humanising nonsense ' - but *entertaining*
