home secretary @entity0 defended the decision to terminate the @entity3 contract with @entity5 firm @entity4 - despite being ordered to pay hundreds of millions of pounds in damages taxpayers were last night landed with a £ 500million bill for the ‘ catastrophic ’ it project intended to protect our borders			1
an arbitration tribunal ruled the way the @entity14 had terminated the contract for the shambolic @entity3 scheme was unlawful			1
defence firm @entity4 will now pocket £ 223million of public money , including £ 50million in damages			1
the settlement is in addition to the £ 260million the @entity21 had spent by the time @entity4 was fired in july 2010 with the journey - logging system in disarray			1
legal fees are expected to push the final bill to half a billion pounds			0
the contract debacle sparked new questions about the performance of @entity29 , who was paid £ 200,000 a year to run the @entity30 from 2005 to 2011			1
she was in charge of her officials ’ disastrous management of the @entity3 project , and presided over a string of other blunders			1
but , despite fierce criticism from mps over her record , miss @entity29 has been promoted to the post of chief executive of the @entity43			0
her time in charge of @entity30 will now be the subject of up to four different inquiries , including a new hearing by the home affairs select committee of the @entity49			0
@entity50 , the commitee ’s @entity51 chairman , said last night : ‘ this is a catastrophic result			0
‘ it is now clear that the @entity30 did n’t know what they wanted from the @entity3 programme			1
‘ we will want to hear further from @entity29 , the then head of the @entity30 , as to why she sanctioned such a defective agreement			0
’ the project was initiated by @entity51 but was poorly managed by officials from the start , and hit by a series of delays			0
it was eventually axed in july 2010 by home secretary @entity0 when , acting on advice from officials , it was deemed impossible to salvage			0
however , the process that the now defunct @entity30 used when reaching a decision to scrap the agreement was flawed according to the @entity71 , which settles global contract disputes			2
@entity51 's @entity74 chair @entity50 said the tribunal 's decision was ' catastrophic ' for the government the @entity78 is expected to step in to pick up much of the bill to minimise the ‘ impact on frontline services ’			2
in a letter , mrs may said : ‘ the government stands by the decision to end the @entity3 contract with @entity4			1
all other alternatives available to the government would have led to greater costs than the result of this tribunal ruling			2
’ despite its own role in the shambles , @entity51 last night criticised the government ’s handling of the contracts			0
the party ’s @entity14 spokesman @entity97 said : ‘ this is a crushing verdict			0
as a result of this stalled process , we are still far away from counting people in and out of the @entity104			2

government unlawfully scrapped @entity3 contract with @entity4
*eborders* scheme intended to screen everyone coming to and leaving @entity104
it has been beset by *problems* leading to termination of contract this year
but a tribunal has ruled the government had acted unlawfully it has *emerged*
