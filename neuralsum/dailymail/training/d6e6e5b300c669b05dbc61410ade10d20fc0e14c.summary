by @entity0 published : 07:31 est , 11 july 2012 updated : 08:30 est , 11 july 2012 @entity2 may have received part of a $ 600,000 donation made by dr @entity0 to her parents ’ charity , it has been claimed			1
the money was handed over after @entity9 and @entity2 were interviewed on the tv show in september			0
it was destined for the @entity12 , set up in memory of the daughter @entity15 had been acquitted of killing			1
but in papers filed as part of a defamation suit , lawyers claim that a portion of the cash has gone to the 26 - year - old herself			1
they do not specify how much she received			0
in a trial which gripped the nation , the jury heard how @entity15 had initially claimed her two - year - old had vanished she told them an elaborate tale in which a fictitious babysitter she dubbed ‘ @entity2 ’ kidnapped her daughter			1
high - profile : @entity2 sits in court during her sentencing at the @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity45 , july 7 , 2011 but prosecutors alleged that little @entity12 had actually drowned in the swimming pool and her mother had then got rid of her body			2
@entity15 was acquitted of murder but found guilty of lying to the authorities , who maintained that the babysitter never existed			1
in a bizarre twist , she is now being sued by a woman called @entity57 – who has the same name as the fictitious ‘ @entity2 ’			1
ms @entity57 claims her life was ruined by being falsely associated with the case			2
her attorney @entity61 said papers lodged tuesday included information about the donation , which was made by dr @entity65 who hosts the dr @entity0 show it was reported in the @entity68 that @entity61 said : ' our sources have indicated that she has received money directly from her mother , @entity25			2
' the new filing is the latest in a number of requests for information ahead of the civil trial which is due to start in january next year			0
@entity9 and @entity2 's lawyers or lawyers for @entity15 have n't commented on the report			1
there has been much public anger following the establishment of the @entity12 in 2008			0
the foundation was set up to assist the families of missing children , but through the process of the murder trial it seemed to become inactive			0
after @entity2 's acquittal she and her parents stayed out of the media spotlight until the @entity95 interview with dr @entity0 which received a lot of attention and criticism			0
capturing hearts : @entity2 , 2 , daughter of @entity2 , went missing in june 2008 and was found in woods near her grandparents house six months later a website was created for the foundation , but the link does not currently work			2
the site had stated : ' @entity108 administrators will work closely with families of missing children to provide needed support , which will be focused mainly on the collection and dissemination of information about the missing child in an effort to facilitate widespread awareness			0
' such was the concern about the foundation 's work that a @entity122 group was set up on @entity123 to monitor the organisation .			0

attorneys want to find out if woman acquitted of murdering her daughter *benefited* from donation
request made by @entity57 's legal team - she is suing @entity15 for defamation
@entity15 was acquitted of murder charges last year but found guilty of lying to authorities
