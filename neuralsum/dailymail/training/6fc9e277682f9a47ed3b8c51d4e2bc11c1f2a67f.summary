by @entity0 published : 05:17 est , 24 january 2014 updated : 14:09 est , 24 january 2014 a real @entity2 takes 50 days hundreds of people to build , but one student has created an impressive miniature paper version of the jetliner			1
@entity7 crafted the incredible replica aircraft using only glue and manila cardboard folders , and it contains tiny details from padded airline seats , to fan blades in the engines and even retractable landing gear			1
the 22 - year - old thinks he could have finished the model - which is almost complete – if he had worked on it non-stop for a year , but said it would have been ‘ a hellish experience			1
so far it has taken him over five years instead , mr @entity7 has spent over five years building the 1:60 - scale jetliner in his spare time , while attending college			1
he first learned to build models out of paper at high school and his love of airplane led to his mammoth project			1
‘ i was lucky enough to go to a high school with an amazing architecture department , which was a huge source of inspiration , ’ mr @entity7 told @entity33			1
the student uses photographs and designs on which to base his drawings and designs for the model airplane			0
it all started when he found a detailed diagram of an @entity45 @entity2 the model contains tiny details , from padded airline seats , wings built with a structure similar to the real jetliner ( pictured right ) and even retractable landing gear ( pictured left ) mr @entity7 says it is hard to describe exactly how the plane came together but explained that he made the fuselage ( the aircraft 's main body section ) first - which took several attempts - before building the seats and cabin compartments and furnishing the interior ‘ we learned to build simple manila folder " massing " models of basic structures , and i suppose i took that concept to the extreme with this model plane			1
‘ i 've been interested in aviation for many years , and this project combines my love of airplanes with my love of art and design , ’ he added			1
after finding a detailed diagram of an @entity45 777 online , mr @entity7 started drafting his own plans for the model using just a pencil and paper			1
the student learned to build simple manila folder ' massing ' models of basic structures took the concept to the extreme with this model plane 22 - year - old @entity7 ( pictured ) has spent over five years building the 1:60 - scale jetliner in his spare time , while attending college the airplane was constructed from manila folders ( pictured ) , glue and a lot of patience ‘ i traced a can to make the perfectly circular fuselage cross-section , but i soon hit a wall , where it became impractical to keep designing this way , which forced me to start using the computer , ’ he explained			1
‘ these days , i look at photos and / or engineering drawings and use them to draw up my own plans in @entity110			0
‘ i use @entity111 - though it is n't at all intended for my purposes - and i then print onto the folder , cut out the parts , and assemble , ’ he said			2
mr @entity7 says it is hard to describe exactly how the plane came together but explained that he made the fuselage ( the aircraft ’s main body section ) first – which took several attempts – before building the seats and cabin compartments and furnishing the interior			1
after building the main body of the plane , mr @entity7 re-skinned the nose and tail ( pictured ) , built the tailfin and horizontal stabilisers and painted the fuselage he uses @entity111 to print the pieces he designed onto a manilla folder so that he can cut out the parts and assemble them into intricate pieces like this the student paid very close attention to photos , diagrams and plans of @entity2 's 777 aircraft to make sure he got all the deatils of the jetliner correct - down to the curtains and door mechanisms he then re-skinned the nose and tail , built the tailfin and horizontal stabilisers and painted the fuselage			1
‘ the engines were done in the middle of that process - often i 'll switch to a different component when i get bored , ’ he said			0
‘ i 've essentially made two planes , with many of the early attempts being discarded , ’ mr @entity7 said			1
‘ i ’m starting on the wings now , which i expect to take several months			0
they 're the final components , thankfully , ’ he added			0
it is hard to believe that the intricate opening on the left is made from just manilla folders and glue			2
mr @entity7 now uses a computer to design and print out the precise little pieces needed to make airplane components ( pictured right ) he explained that he has essentially made two planes , with many of the early attempts being discarded , but has now honed his technique to create details such as this opening with a curtain , which looks like an airplane kitchen as he is not designing in @entity174 , mr @entity7 said it was tough to come up with the plans , especially for parts with unusual shapes like the engines and wings			2
‘ assembling these parts can also be incredibly challenging			0
i only recently discovered how to make the paper truly bend in three dimensions , ’ he said			0
‘ other parts are challenging simply because of how monotonous they can be to assemble			0
there were a huge number of economy seats to build and i was luckily able to watch movies and tv while i put them together , but it was still a gruelling process			0
’ as he is not designing in @entity174 , mr @entity7 said it was tough to come up with the plans , especially for parts with unusual shapes like the engines , door openings ( pictured ) and wings mr @entity7 said it is rewarding to be able to replicate a part with a high degree of accuracy			2
‘ seeing the model come together feels like a tremendous accomplishment , as difficult as it 's been to get to this point			0
when it 's done , i can only imagine how relieved i 'll feel			0
’ while he has no idea what will happen to his model airplane , he hopes it will eventually find a place in a museum collection as it is something he would like people to be able to see in person , as well as in snapshots on his @entity213 page			2

' seeing the model come together feels like a tremendous accomplishment , as difficult as it 's been to get to this point			0
when it 's done , i can only imagine how relieved i 'll feel , ' he said ‘ many people have told me that they 've sent photos to friends who work at @entity2 , but @entity2 itself has yet to contact me directly , ’ he added			0
while mr @entity7 said he loves making models , he thinks he is ‘ ready to try something different ’ after the plane is completed			2
‘ as great as it will be to see this come together , it 's really sucked a lot of energy out of me , and it can be very isolating at times , so it 's not something i 'd immediately jump back into , ’ he said .			0

@entity7 from @entity245 has spent over five *painstaking* years building the 1:60 - scale jetliner made of cut up card folders
he first learned to build models out of paper at high school and his love of airplanes led to his mammoth project
the 22 - year - old hopes his @entity2 model could one day go on show at a museum when he has finished it
