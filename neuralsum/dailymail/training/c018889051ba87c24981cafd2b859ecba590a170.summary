by @entity0 published : 19:23 est , 30 july 2013 updated : 19:24 est , 30 july 2013 disability benefit claimants in @entity3 soak up over a fifth more in handouts than their counterparts in @entity6 , an analysis found yesterday			1
it said the cost to taxpayers of disability benefits paid north of the border amounts to £ 593 for every person in @entity3 – while in @entity6 the figure is £ 461			1
the breakdown by the country ’s most respected economic think tank , the @entity17 , said one reason may be that @entity3 are more likely to claim disability benefits than people in @entity6			1
@entity21 said the cost to taxpayers of disability benefits paid north of the border amounts to £ 593 for every person in @entity3 , while in @entity6 the figure is £ 461			1
file picture other reasons may be that @entity3 suffer from greater ill health and disability , or that assessments meant to weed out those who are fit to work may be less strict than in the rest of the country			1
it may also be that there are more benefit cheats in @entity3 , the report said			0
the @entity17 analysis , prepared as advice for @entity3 voters in advance of next year ’s independence referendum , said spending on benefits is likely to rise faster in @entity3 than the rest of the country			2
‘ funding the benefits system in the decades ahead may prove somewhat more burdensome for an independent @entity3 , ’ it warned			2
spending on disability benefits is relatively higher in @entity3 and spending on housing benefit lower , while @entity3 's older population leads to relatively less being spent on child - related benefits and more on pensioners the research , funded by the government ’s @entity55 , said overall benefit costs in @entity3 were £ 17.2billion in the financial year 2011/12 , 30 per cent of all taxpayer spending in @entity3			1
this came to £ 3,238 for every individual , 2 per cent higher than the £ 3,176 for the rest of @entity63			0
the gap has narrowed in recent years , the @entity17 said			0
but the picture is skewed because high spending on social housing in @entity3 means low rents for tenants , and so claims for @entity71 are much lower than in the rest of the country			0
if public spending on housing is taken into account , the real cost to taxpayers of subsidising housing in @entity3 is £ 597 for every person in the population , compared to £ 493 in @entity6 and £ 471 in @entity82			0
disability benefits are 23 per cent higher for every individual than in @entity6			1
the @entity17 paper said an independent @entity3 could push through radical reforms of its own benefit system			0
but it warned : ‘ any major redesign of the system would either require @entity3 to spend rather more on benefits than is spent now or else create large numbers of losers , who will typically have fairly low incomes			2
’ @entity17 economist @entity95 , the author of the report , said : ‘ overall benefit spending per person is similar in @entity3 to the rest of @entity63			0
‘ but within this there are considerable differences : spending on disability benefits is relatively higher in @entity3 and spending on housing benefit lower , while @entity3 ’s older population leads to relatively less being spent on child - related benefits and more on pensioners			1
‘ @entity109 ... would provide @entity3 with an opportunity to design its own benefits system			2
it would also need to adapt it to the fact that @entity3 ’s population is projected to age faster than the rest of the @entity117			0

@entity3 ' more likely to claim disability benefits ' , says research
poor health and more *lax* *policing* of claimants may be behind *disparity*
