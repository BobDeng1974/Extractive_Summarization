by @entity0 published : 10:38 est , 2 august 2013 updated : 13:15 est , 2 august 2013 fitness and dieting apps are ten a penny , so in a saturated market it can be hard for new programmes to stand out			0
the ‘ @entity9 ’ app from @entity8 is aiming to grab attention by marrying personal training with ' anime ' dating - and throwing a bit of bullying into the mix too			1
the app combines the world of ‘ gaming dating ’ ( where the player is a lonely singleton who tries to win the affections of potential partners ) with weight loss			1
sounds like a healthy relationship			0
to start , each player creates an animated character , who then meets up with their childhood sweetheart			0
the long - lost love proceeds to tell you you 've got fat and need to lose weight			1
the love interest then morphs into a personal trainer , who ' motivates ' you through workouts - such as sets of crunches - becoming increasingly romantically interested as you lose weight			1
the app has a number of workouts which are prescribed to you by your crush			2
as you exercise , your partner screams encouragement ( what we might call abuse ) while keeping count of your sit - ups or laps			0
as your weight drops and love blossoms , you are taken through increasingly amorous scenarios - though how the relationship develops depends on your dieting success			2
your crush prescribes various exercises for you , then encourages you through your workout by shouting abuse while the app aimed at women features a love interest who borders on sadistic , overweight boys get a sweet girl who encourages weight loss through compliments and concern			1
created by ‘ @entity84 ’ the app has done well in @entity8 , and there 's now an @entity88 version available on @entity89 and @entity90			0
however it remains to be seen how well @entity93 women respond to being screamed at for being lardy .			0

new @entity95 app ' @entity9 ' combines virtual dating with weight loss
an animated love interest tells you to lose weight
crush becomes a personal trainer who guides you through workouts
*female* version features a man that shouts at you and calls you ' fatty '
male version encourages weight loss through compliments
the more weight you lose the more keen your crush becomes on you
