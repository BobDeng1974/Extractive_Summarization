decades after mysteriously disappearing , ' @entity0 ' again			0
the infamous ' @entity1 ' will be exhibited at @entity2 in @entity3 , @entity4 , starting next week after touring at fairgrounds and malls across the country in the late 60s and early 70s			1
the museum 's owner , @entity8 , said wednesday that the frozen , ' @entity11 - like monster ' will be on display beginning july 3			1
resurfaced : after decades missing , the ' @entity1 ' is going to be on display at @entity2 in @entity3 , @entity4 on display : museum of the weird owner , @entity8 , pictured , bought the iceman from the family of its original exhibitor the iceman , 6 - feet - tall , was billed as ' the @entity21 ' or ' the creature of @entity24 ' beginning in 1968			1
the hairy creature was displayed in a solid block of ice inside a refrigerated coffin			2
a man named @entity30 exhibited the iceman and claimed to have been behind its discovery , according to the book ' @entity11 exposed : an @entity36 's @entity35 '			0
two cryptozoologists , @entity38 and @entity39 , examined the body during their search for evidence of @entity11 the same year the iceman became a carnival exhibit			2
the pair believed the creature to be a real , unknown species , with @entity38 even remarking he could smell a decomposing corpse through cracks in the icy tomb			0
frozen : encased in ice , the hairy beast was originally exhibited by @entity30 , who first said he discovered it in @entity55 , but later said he shot it in @entity57 the pair believed the creature to be an evolutionary missing link -- @entity39 even dubbed him ' @entity62 pongoides '			1
after the two cryptozoologists examined the creature , @entity38 convinced someone at the @entity66 to launch an official investigation			1
unfortunately , @entity30 reportedly switched the ' real ' body with a latex dummy before an investigation took place			0
at first , @entity30 suggested he found the iceman in @entity55 , but he confessed he shot the creature in @entity57 woods before putting it on ice			1
as a result of these new claims , the @entity77 almost became involved , thinking @entity30 had been exhibiting a murder victim			0
bigfoot : the @entity1 has been billed as similar to @entity11 , supposedly seen in this famous frame from a 1967 film when the @entity66 assessed the @entity87 -- after @entity30 said he switched it with a dummy -- the museum stated it was ' satisfied that the creature is simply a carnival exhibit made of latex rubber and hair ... the " original " model and the present so - called " substitute " are one and the same ' , according to ' @entity95 '			1
investigators with the @entity66 also discovered a company on the @entity98 made @entity100 an iceman in 1967 , but whether or not it was just a replica of the ' real ' iceman			2
the company @entity30 commissioned to make the dummy never saw an original			0
after touring through the early 70s , the creature and its eccentric owner remained out of the public eye until 10 years ago , the @entity106 reported			0
after investigating its whereabouts for two years , @entity8 tracked down @entity30 's family and bought the frozen beast or rubber impersonation , depending on who 's talking			2
mystery : the iceman is also akin to @entity118 , possibly seen in this 2007 photograph taken in @entity120			0
