by @entity0 published : 00:56 est , 6 october 2013 updated : 00:56 est , 6 october 2013 doctors ordered a month 's rest for @entity4 's president on saturday after they found blood on her brain due to a head injury			1
president @entity9 's spokesman said she had suffered a previously undisclosed ' skull trauma ' on august 12			1

forced leave : @entity4 president @entity9 attended a rally in the @entity25 just days ago but has been forced to abandon campaigning but he said problems surfaced saturday after @entity29 , 60 , went to a hospital for checks on an irregular heartbeat			1
because she was suffering headaches , they looked at her skull again , too , and found a subdural hematoma			2
that means bleeding between the brain and the skull			2
the statement defined it as " chronic " and not ' acute , ' which suggests that it has been slowly building			0
' the president had a cardiovascular study done in the @entity47 and given that she had head pain , they did neurological studies , diagnosing a " chronic subdural collection " ( bleeding on the brain ) , and they ordered her to rest for a month , ' said the statement , which was signed by the president 's doctors			2

@entity57 has been told by doctors to take a month off after she sustained a head injury in august that that was originally given the all - clear according to the @entity64 , the symptoms of chronic subdural collections usually do not heal by themselves and often require surgery that involves drilling small holes in the skull to drain the liquid , relieving pressure and to reduce or prevent brain damage			1
