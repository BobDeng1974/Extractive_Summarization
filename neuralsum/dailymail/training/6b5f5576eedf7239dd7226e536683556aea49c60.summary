by @entity0 published : 07:14 est , 6 november 2012 @entity2 : 07:37 est , 6 november 2012 marine biologists scouring the seabed have discovered an new species of carnivorous sponge that bears a remarkable resemblance to a harp or lyre			2
a team from the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) in @entity12 , @entity13 , found the weird deep - sea predator off their state 's northern coast			1
they named the new species @entity19 - or harp sponge - because the basic structure of its body is shaped like the musical instrument			2
weird predator : the harp sponge , or @entity19 , so called because its strange body bears a remarkable resemblance to a harp or lyre using remotely operated deep - sea vehicles , the @entity11 team led by dr @entity33 collected two harp sponges and recorded video footage of ten more , sci - news.com reported			1
the first speciments they discovered had only two vanes , but subsequent dives revealed examples with up to six vanes radiating from the creature 's centre			0
the sponges barbed hooks covering their branching limbs to snare tiny crustaceans before enveloping the creatures in a thin membrane and slowly digesting it			1
the scientists who made the discovery believe that the harp sponge - which lives on the ocean floor at depths of between 10,800 â € “ 11,500 feet - has evolved its distinctive candelabra - like structure to increase the surface area it exposes to the ocean currents to catch its prey			0
sponges typically feed by straining bacteria and bits of organic material from seawater filtering through their bodies , and its less than 20 years since scientists first discovered some species that were carnivores			0
' @entity73 lyra is an extraordinary example of the kind of adaptations that animals must make in order to survive in such a hostile environment , ' the @entity11 team reported in the journal @entity81 .			0

@entity19 lives at depths of *11,000ft* of the coast of @entity13
marine biologists discovered it using remote - control deep - sea vehicles
it traps traps and eats tiny crustaceans using hooks on its branching limbs
