@entity0 will oppose any move from @entity2 to keep @entity3 at the @entity4 for longer than his agreed loan spell			1
@entity3 has been a hit at @entity2 since his loan from their sister club in the @entity10 started recently , scoring once against @entity11 and twice in the @entity13 rout of @entity14			1
the 36 - year - old ’s impressive form has prompted suggestions that he may prove useful to @entity2 boss @entity17 beyond the length of his current loan spell that is due to end in january			1
@entity3 is scheduled to return to parent club @entity0 from @entity2 in january city boss @entity17 has been impressed with @entity3 and hopes he stays at the @entity4 for longer the midfielder scored against his old club @entity11 on sunday , and has found his stride at @entity2 @entity3 also scored twice in the 7 - 0 @entity13 win against @entity14 at the @entity4 @entity17 has not ruled out the possibility of @entity3 staying but sources in @entity27 stressed on thursday that @entity0 expect their marquee signing to be in the @entity29 for pre-season training in the new year after building a marketing strategy around him and selling tickets due to his transfer			1
while there is no suggestion that @entity2 and the @entity10 franchise it established last year are pulling in opposite directions , it would appear that @entity2 fans will have to make do with just five months of the former @entity42 star			1
asked about the @entity3 stories on tuesday this week , @entity0 coach @entity43 said : ‘ there is no truth in this rumour at all			1
’ @entity3 poses for a selfie with a fan during @entity2 's @entity13 clash with @entity14 the @entity10 season does n’t start until march and there is an argument that @entity3 wo n’t need a pre-season if he has been playing with @entity2			1
however , it is understood that officials in @entity57 see @entity3 as their big sell this season — even more so than fellow summer signing @entity60 — and want him available for their training camp and a series of warm - up games			1
@entity3 steered clear of the issue on thursday , saying he would let the two clubs make the decision			1
‘ i ’m contracted here until the start of january and that is how it is at the moment , ’ he said			2
‘ more than that , i do n’t know			0
the argument ( about me staying ) has only come up since i scored at the weekend			0
the important thing for me is to train well , play well and then see what happens			0
‘ i signed on here until january so that is all i can say			0
when i signed for @entity2 on loan , six weeks or so ago , it was always until january and that is the way it remains so i would n’t want to get too far ahead of myself			1
the former @entity42 star signed for @entity0 in july but went on loan to @entity2 almost immediately ‘ it is not my place to do that			1
it would be a club decision , first and foremost			0
i will train and play as well as i can and the rest is up to the club			0
’ @entity3 enjoyed a memorable night on wednesday and found himself in an embrace with a young fan who ran on to the field five minutes from the end to take a ‘ selfie ’ with his favourite player			2
the 15 - year - old was released on bail by @entity98 until october 19 after being arrested on suspicion of encroachment of the pitch			0
he is expected to be banned for three games by @entity2			2
@entity3 had been at @entity11 for 13 years prior to joining @entity2 and it has clearly been a challenge to adjust to a new environment			1
‘ yes , it ’s been very different , ’ he admitted			0
‘ i was at @entity11 such a long time you just go along on auto - pilot in the end			2
you know how it is , you drive in every day , you know everybody behind the scenes			0
the 36 - year - old was hugely emotional after scoring against his old club @entity11 on sunday ‘ it was a tester for me to come here			1
i did n’t have to make this decision but it was a very good opportunity for me to train and play at this level which arose			0
‘ and it is a personal test to come up to @entity119 and be up here for this six months , or five months , whatever it is			0
i was very much in a comfort zone at @entity11			2
i worked at @entity11 for 13 years , trained there , played there and now it is different			2
it is good to test yourself in life and all i can say is that i am enjoying it			2
‘ i ’m very fortunate			0
not many players at the age of 36 get the opportunity to come and play among these players			0
when you look around the dressing room there is so much quality and that is a real honour for me to come and play amongst that			0
