by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent prisoners should be allowed access to computers and the internet despite the security risks because they are living in a technological ‘ dark age ’ , it was claimed today			1
chief inspector of prisons @entity9 sparked controversy by calling for murderers , paedophiles and terrorists to be allowed to log on to websites			2
he argued giving offenders the chance to surf the web would help with reintegration into society and reduce reoffending			1
but critics said it was ‘ barmy ’ to give prisoners access to the internet where they could plan crimes , do drug deals , torment victims and log onto extremist websites			1
mr @entity9 said secure , controlled use of the internet could also transform education , family contact and resettlement in jails - making it less likely inmates would return to a life of crime after leaving jail mr @entity9 , who was embroiled in a war of words with ministers this month after claiming prison were overcrowded , spoke out at a conference on modernising justice in @entity47			1
he said secure , controlled use of the internet could also transform education , family contact and resettlement in jails – making it less likely inmates would return to a life of crime after leaving jail			0
greater internet access could assist prisoners in looking for jobs and studying for qualifications as well as for making practical arrangements prior to their release , he said			2
mr @entity9 said : ‘ like other risk management processes in a prison , prisoners ’ access to new technologies and the internet needs to be based on risk assessment of the individual concerned and properly supervised			1
‘ i do n’t think we can go on with prisons in a pre-internet dark age : inefficient and wasteful and leaving prisoners woefully unprepared for the world they will face on release			1
‘ yes , there are security issues to be addressed , but the technology allows every key stroke to be monitored and access can be risk assessed			0
chief inspector of prisons @entity9 controversially called for prisoners to be allowed access to the internet ‘ there is a fear that a move in this direction will be seen as being soft on prisoners			1
but we ca n’t leave prisons in a time warp			0
’ mr @entity9 said it was ‘ relatively easy ’ for prisoners to get hold of an illegal mobile phone in prison through which they could access the internet			1
only last month film footage taken on a mobile phone emerged showing a group of boys in a @entity96 kicking and punching fellow inmates in a sickening ritual			0
prison reform campaigners have pointed out that in @entity100 , all prisoners have access to the internet , even in their cells , with firewalls set up to ensure security			2
a report last year found three - quarters of all governors of prisons in @entity107 and @entity108 who responded to a survey believed inmates should have controlled access to the internet			2
but @entity112 , director of the @entity114 think - tank , said large numbers of prisoners had been convicted of crimes involving misuse of computers and the internet , such as paedophiles who downloaded sex abuse images and @entity123 extremists			0
he said : ‘ internet access would be another serious blow to the notion that prison is a place where criminals are finally punished			0
‘ this could do real damage to the fight against organised crime and it risks victims being intimidated and terrorised			0
‘ surely prison guards have better things to do than stand over criminals watching them surf the internet			0
’ a @entity140 spokesman said : ‘ advances in technology can provide useful tools to aid rehabilitation in prison , however there are clear security risks in allowing prisoner ’s access to the internet and public protection will always be our priority			0
