by @entity0 as a child , my ambition was to be a ballerina			1
i would stand on tiptoes and twirl around in the mirror imagining myself leaping across the stage at the @entity8 to the crowd 's rapturous applause			1
but soon after starting dance classes , it became crushingly obvious that no matter how adroit my pirouette , i would never be @entity14			2
where my fellow dancers ' legs were long and lithe , mine were short by comparison			1
i had to give up my dreams of ballet stardom and went into contemporary dance instead			1
it was an early lesson in having to make the best of what i had			2
even now at 70 , despite being under 5ft 3in , i always try to make the most of my legs because i 've been so painfully aware of their , well , shortcomings			1
autograph dress , £ 69 , marksandspencer.com ; nude patent heels , £ 185 , lucychoilondon.com ( right ) it does n't help that i have gained weight over the past two years			1
i used to be very strict with my diet , cutting out carbohydrates , but recently i 've relaxed a bit and started eating the things i love - cheese , chocolate and pasta			2
i 've gone up from a size eight to a size 12 , which is quite a lot for my height , and it means i have to dress even more cleverly , because some outfits - like the one pictured i wore last september - can make me look dumpy			1
if you 've ever seen me judging , you 'll know i never give very high marks			2
but i do think some of these outfits , selected by the @entity49 's fashion editor @entity48 , work wonders			1
@entity51 says : @entity52 of @entity53 has fabulous legs , but there 's a reason she often wears nude heels			1
paired with matching tights , they can make your legs look up to six inches longer because you trick the eye into seeing the shoe as part of the leg			1
meanwhile the dark side panels on this dress have the effect of whittling down the waist			0
9/10 @entity48 says : it 's not just the shoe 's colour that matters - the style can also affect how long your legs look			1
avoid ankle - strap or t - bar shoes , which will cut your leg off at the ankle and cost you inches			0
dress , £ 89 , @entity79 at @entity80 ; gold courts , £ 395 , jimmy @entity82 ( left ) and @entity84 jacket , £ 139 , @entity85 ; dress , £ 89 , phase - eight.co.uk ; patent heels , £ 525 , christianlouboutin.com ( right ) @entity51 says : this reminds me of the ballet dress i wore to teach in , and i 'd forgotten what a flattering look it is			2
it has a lovely , flirty swing and makes my legs look like they start from my waist			2
and with this neckline , i 'm well aware my best asset is my bosom rather than my legs ! 6/10 @entity48 says : the wide flare is an optical illusion , making the legs look longer , and the floaty edge does n't cut your legs off halfway up , as a pencil skirt would			1
@entity51 says : instead of accentuating my natural waistline , this dress gives me a waist just under my bust , which has the effect of making my top half shorter and my bottom half longer			0
usually , i avoid horizontal stripes in case they give me extra width			0
but the dark panels at the side mean the overall effect here is slimming			0
however , the stripes do n't make me feel totally confident			0
6/10 @entity48 says : if you 're short , avoid clothes that accentuate your natural waist			1
the higher your waistline , the longer the legs appear			2
dress , £ 65 , @entity127 at @entity80 ; shoes , £ 195 , lucychoilondon.com ( left ) and @entity84 blouse , £ 175 , @entity85 ; trousers , £ 95 , and shoes , £ 139 , reiss.com ( right ) @entity51 says : oh yes			0
the soft , stretchy , clingy crepe fits perfectly to the body but gives a long , smooth line			0
because you ca n't see my knees , it gives the illusion mine could be higher than they are ! and the skirt shows off every inch of lower leg			0
10/10 @entity48 says : covering your knees gives the impression your legs go up higher than they do			1
but do n't let hems fall too low - a mid-calf skirt can look grannyish if you 're lacking in height			0
@entity51 says : to lengthen the leg , match your shoe colour to your trousers			0
then the eye travels from the top of your leg to the floor			0
this gives the impression that my waistline is higher than it is			0
and if these trousers had been in black or white , i 'd have been in heaven , but i 'm not crazy about the bright blue			0
5/10 @entity167 says : as well as colour - matching trousers and shoes , choose a slim , tapered - leg trouser			0
trousers that are wide at the bottom , like a boot - cut or flare , will make your legs look shorter - no matter how high your heels .			2

in ballet @entity0 , 70 , realised her legs were short in comparison to others '
now she 's gained some weight outfits can be more *unflattering*
