on wednesday @entity0 published its forensic study to finally settle one of football 's great debates - which is the biggest club in @entity6 ? our exclusive table ranked the top 50 teams from the 59 who have played in the top flight for six categories : crowds , global fanbase , trophies , league finish , player quality and income			1
@entity19 came out on top followed by @entity21 and then @entity22			1
former @entity22 captain @entity23 and @entity25 legend @entity24 have their say on our findings			1
inside by @entity23 ( @entity28 ) @entity21 bigger than @entity22 ? i ’m sure my old mates @entity31 and @entity32 will be delighted about that one and they will be looking forward to the chance to rub my big nose in it			1
needless to say , it is not a view with which i would agree			0
but this is not me , as former @entity22 captain and dyed - in - the - wool lifelong supporter , being biased			1
i ’m basing my argument on what i have seen from travelling the world over many years			0
@entity23 parades the trophy after their 1 - 0 victory over @entity48 to win the 1981 @entity49 @entity23 lifts the trophy above his head as his team - mates celebrate beside him after the 1981 final @entity23 says @entity32 ( left ) would rub his nose in it after @entity21 were ranked as a bigger club @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 celebrate as @entity21 complete the @entity60 in 1971 @entity22 have always been trailblazers			1
i remember in the early 1980s , our squad went to the @entity64 and played exhibition games in @entity66 and @entity67			0
the reaction was like nothing we had ever seen			0
it was the same when we went to @entity72 , @entity73 or some of the states in the @entity75			0
@entity22 were the dominant team in the game in that era and people were desperate to see us			2
but , over the course of the next 30 years , as football ’s popularity has mushroomed , interest in @entity22 has continued to grow			1
in the summer of 2011 , for instance , i was in @entity84 doing some ambassadorial work for the club during the pre-season tour			0
one night , an open training session was staged in @entity89 , @entity90 ’s national stadium , and 40,000 fans turned up to watch			0
@entity90 supporters cheer for @entity22 during the summer tour in 2011 @entity23 attends a press conference during the @entity22 legends tour of @entity96 in 2013 @entity21 ended a ten - year trophy drought by coming back to beat @entity98 in a memorable fa cup final last may the reception was phenomenal — and this was just to watch the squad doing some jogging and shooting practice			1
a couple of years later , i was part of a legends squad that went to tour @entity96			0
we played one match in the @entity110 stadium in @entity111 and more 30,000 fans turned up			0
they had n’t just come from @entity111 , however ; they had come from all over the country			0
that is the draw @entity22 ’s name has			2
now i have great respect for @entity21			1
since moving into the @entity119 in 2006 , i can see why they have ticked a lot of the boxes in the survey			0
@entity22 ’s capacity , after all , is 45,000			2
@entity21 , meanwhile , seem to have 60,000 for each home game , even when you can see gaps in the stands			2
but , seriously , what i think separates @entity22 — and @entity19 , for that matter — from the rest is history and heritage			1
you can talk about @entity135 ‘ likes ’ and @entity137 followers but what really matters are the trophies you win and the memories you create			0
@entity23 lifts the @entity143 trophy onto his head after @entity22 beat @entity145 in the 1981 final @entity23 lifts the @entity49 in 1981 as @entity22 won the competition three times in five years it is why when you go to @entity150 and @entity151 , for example , the only clubs people will talk to you about are @entity22 and @entity19 ; very seldom will you hear @entity48 and @entity155 — never mind @entity21 , @entity156 and @entity157 — being mentioned			1
@entity22 and @entity19 dominate these strongholds because , between them , they dominated five decades			1
young fans growing up in the 1960s would have seen the @entity19 team of @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 or the side @entity166 was building at @entity167			2
we went on to enjoy incredible success in the 1970s and 1980s , @entity19 had a similar spell in the 1990s and 2000s			2
those around the world who have grown up with success will have passed their affinities on to their children and that is where the respective huge fan bases have come from			0
@entity22 came out on top for most trophies won , and @entity23 says that is what matters most @entity23 ( back row second left ) poses with the 1977 - 87 @entity22 team @entity0 's extensive study found that @entity19 are @entity6 's biggest club with @entity21 and @entity22 second at third respectively of course , there will be changes in the coming years			1
for starters , fans in south east @entity191 can follow trends , and teams that are doing well — as @entity156 and @entity157 have been — will attract more interest , while @entity21 are certainly up and coming in that region			1
when all is said and done , though , those clubs can not yet match the deep - rooted affinities that so many have for @entity22 , which have come from those glorious nights when we won @entity204 cups and countless other trophies			1
things have changed in the @entity208 era and i understand the business side of football and how important it is to make full use of commercial opportunities , such as selling shirts and bringing in extra revenue with big sponsorship deals			0
yet the key to it all is having great players and being involved in the games that matter the most			2
that , more than anything , is what defines how big a club is — and @entity22 ’s list of honours speaks for itself			2
why city deserve to be fifth @entity25 legend @entity24 maintains that teams deserve the ‘ big club ’ tag by winning trophies			1
commenting on the study in thursday 's @entity0 , @entity24 said the rankings of @entity157 ( 4th ) and @entity156 ( 5th ) in the ‘ big clubs ’ league table were justified despite owners splashing hundreds of millions of pounds in recent years			1
@entity25 were listed ninth in our findings , one place above rivals @entity241 , who @entity24 later joined			1
@entity243 celebrates with the @entity156 squad as they are crowned @entity246 champions @entity156 are jubilant after winning their second @entity246 title in three years in 2014 but rather than claim the @entity249 clubs — with their loyal and sizeable fanbase — should reside above the likes of @entity157 and @entity156 , @entity24 said : ‘ for me , a big club is one that wins trophies			1
’ @entity24 , the last man to lift a trophy for the @entity255 when they won the @entity257 in 1969 , added : ‘ if you were ranking @entity25 on supporters alone i ’d have them in the top three			1
the fans are loyal , passionate and fill the ground week in , week out , regardless of what happens on the pitch			0
‘ in that sense , both they and @entity241 are huge			0
but , as we know , @entity25 have not won a trophy since 1969 and @entity241 since 1973			2
@entity267 celebrates with the @entity49 trophy after winning the competition in 2012 former @entity25 captain @entity24 holds aloft the @entity257 in 1969 - the club 's last trophy ‘ you could say @entity156 have bought success but they were always a big club in my day , people sometimes forget that			1
@entity157 have won a lot of trophies after financial backing but they ’ve had good days in the past too			0
‘ some @entity249 fans might argue their teams should be higher but ranking them in the top 10 is fair and actually recognises how big they are			0
’ @entity24 , 70 , also agreed with placing @entity21 in second , above @entity22			1
‘ @entity21 have always been a big club , all the way back they ’ve been in the top division and won things , ’ he said			2
‘ until @entity166 came in , @entity22 did n’t dominate like they did in the @entity286 and @entity287			2
i remember when they were nothing			0
mr @entity289 , @entity290 , @entity291 when @entity22 increase their ground capacity to 60,000 in two years time , which they should have done 30 years ago , their points tally for home crowds will change dramatically			2
leeeeave it , @entity297 i ’m a @entity157 fan and i was never under the impression that we were the biggest club in @entity6			1
it ’s a pretty well known fact @entity19 , @entity22 and @entity21 all have more fans globally because of their past success			1
that time will come for us whether we buy it with ‘ oil money ’ or not			0
@entity308 , @entity309 the only club in @entity6 that are bigger than @entity311 is @entity19 but if we were in @entity6 we would dwarf 95 per cent of the clubs			1
brace yourself if we ever go into your league			0
@entity315 , @entity316 @entity317 — the club that created the world ’s first league and the club that was the @entity321 for nearly 100 years			0
sorry guys , but when it comes to history , size and trophies won without doping it ’s @entity317 all the way			0
that ’s why your future king and prime minister support them : history and class			0
@entity334 , @entity119 i ’m an @entity21 fan and even i know we ’re not bigger than @entity19 , @entity157 and @entity22			1
i wish we ’d stop pretending it ’s ok and do something about it ! @entity340 , @entity341 , @entity342 which of these clubs are still playing in @entity345 this season ? mr @entity347 , @entity297 @entity19 might be top worldwide , but @entity156 is the most popular club in @entity348 , followed by @entity349 and then @entity19			1
@entity350 , @entity351 @entity352 are comfortably in the top eight without doubt do n’t care what anybody else says ! @entity357 , @entity358 , @entity291 @entity359 have more league titles than @entity157 and @entity156 put together			2
straight , @entity297 if this was done in 2004 , @entity157 would not make the top 20			0
@ chinery26 @entity363 over @entity145			0
@ @entity364 this reminds me of a poll that said @entity368 were a bigger band than the @entity369			0
@entity370 are the biggest club — simple as that .			0

@entity0 study found that @entity21 were the second biggest @entity6 club
@entity22 came in third behind the @entity377 and @entity19
former @entity22 captain @entity23 does not agree with the findings
@entity23 insists it is trophies that matter , not *social* media following
@entity25 legend @entity24 says @entity156 deserve to be fifth
