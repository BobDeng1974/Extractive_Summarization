do you dote treat your children to a gadget or give them money when they perform well at school ? according to a study , such actions could be detrimental to their development , and cause them to be more materialistic as adults			1
the study suggests that those who were rewarded and spoiled as children were more likely to think possessions define who we are			1
a study by the @entity16 and the @entity17 found gifts could affect development			1
adults were more likely to think possessions define who we are ( stock image shown ) if they were showered with rewards when they were children the study was published in the @entity28 and conducted by researchers dr @entity30 ( @entity16 ) and dr @entity31 ( @entity17 )			1
' using material possessions to express love or reward children for their achievements can backfire , ' wrote the authors in the paper called @entity38			1
' loving and supportive parents can unintentionally foster materialism in their children despite their best efforts to steer them away from relying on material possessions to find happiness or to judge others			1
' where you live could affect how big your shopping habit is , according to new research			0
@entity52 scientists have found that people who live in wealthy neighbourhoods are more likely to have materialistic values and poor spending habits			0
and they think that young people living in particularly rich urban areas are the worst offenders			0
@entity60 ’s study is the first to show a connection between neighbourhood socioeconomic status and materialism			0
dr @entity64 , associate professor of psychology at the university , believes the reason for the link is because of ‘ relative deprivation , ’ which is the feeling someone gets when they believe they are less well - off than those around them			0
the authors surveyed 701 adults to measure the long - term impact of material parenting			2
they were asked to describe their current life situation and values , and also reported on a variety of childhood circumstances , their relationship with their parents , and the rewards and punishments they received during three critical ages of childhood results showed adults who had received more material rewards and punishments as children were more likely than others to use possessions to define and express who they are			1
and adults who received many material rewards as children were likely to continue rewarding themselves with material goods and defining themselves through their possessions			2
parents should therefore be cautious about using material goods to express their love and reward their children for good behavior , warn the researchers			2
they say an overemphasis on material possessions during childhood can have long - lasting effects			2
it can pave ' the way for their children to grow up to be more likely than others to admire people with expensive possessions and judge success by the kinds of things people own , ' the authors conclude			0
