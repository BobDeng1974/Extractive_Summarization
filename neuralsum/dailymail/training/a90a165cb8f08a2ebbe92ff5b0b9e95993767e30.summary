@entity0 , the anti-word - mincing human megaphone who was once a vice presidential candidate and the @entity4 's best hope for a new female vanguard , said wednesday that she does n't ' give a flying flip ' if a woman wins the @entity8			1
the change of heart comes as democrat @entity10 is poised to break a glass ceiling and become @entity13 's first ' madame president ' after serving as first lady , a @entity13 senator , secretary of state and the @entity4 's favorite punching bag			1
' i do n't give a flying flip about what gender the person will be , ' @entity0 told @entity23 , who asked her if electing a female president was important			1
' i want the absolute best because @entity13 deserves the best , in terms of leadership , getting this country on the right track			0
' @entity0 said she does n't ' give a flying flip ' if a woman becomes president but admits it would be nice			2
@entity35 : @entity0 was sen. @entity36 's vice presidential running mate in 2008 and lost to president @entity37 and vp @entity38 ' but yeah , it would be nice , ' she finally admitted , ' and it will be nice to see women jump into the ring			2
' the interview aired the same day the @entity44 published a survey of more than 1.800 @entity13 adults , asking questions about the leadership roles of women in modern society			1
@entity44 found that 73 per cent of them expect to see a female president in their lifetimes – but only 38 per cent say they hope it happens			1
another 57 per cent say it does n't matter to them either way			1
there 's also a strong split on the issue along party lines			0
' @entity63 women in particular are strong proponents of female political leaders , ' @entity44 reported			1
' in most cases , they are more likely than both @entity63 men and @entity4 women to say that female political leaders do a better job [ than ] men			1
' ' among @entity63 women , fully 69 per cent say they hope the @entity13 will elect a female president in their lifetime , ' the survey 's writers said			1
' this compares with 46 per cent of @entity63 men , 20 per cent of @entity4 women and 16 per cent of @entity4 men			1
' but for many @entity4 , @entity44 adds , ' this view may be more about the prospect of a @entity10 presidency than about a major milestone for women			1
' heiress - apparent : most political wags think the @entity63 presidential nomination is @entity10 's to claim flame - out : @entity86 rep. @entity85 made a splash in the 2012 @entity4 presidential field but went nowhere after her chronic , debilitating migraines became the stuff of front pages no apologies : comedienne @entity93 ran for president in 2012 on the @entity96 ticket but came up short , taking second place in convention delegates @entity0 was more enthusiastic a month ago about seeing y - chromosomes frozen out of @entity13 's ultimate political prize in 2016			1
' i would love to see a woman on both sides of the aisle shooting for that top spot , ' she told @entity106 in early december – when asked specifically about @entity108 ’s likely candidacy			0
she has also trotted out her ' flying flip ' euphemism before			0
in november 2013 at the height of the @entity112 website crisis , she told @entity113 that the project 's online woes were the least of her concerns			0
' i do n't give a flying flip about a malfunctioning website , ' @entity0 snarked			2
' a broken website is the least of our worries			0
the greater worry is what @entity112 is all about			0
' the @entity13 has a storied history of women running for president and vice president , although most @entity13 ' knowledge of the history does n't stretch back further than the modern era			2
in addition to @entity0 's vp run in 2008 as @entity136 @entity4 sen. @entity36 's running mate , democrat @entity131 took an equally futile shot at the vp race in 1984 with @entity139 in the top slot			2
1984 : @entity141 's favorite year brought us congresswoman @entity131 , who lost as @entity139 's vice presidential running mate @entity144 : in 1872 @entity145 ( left ) ran for president under the @entity148 banner ; the legendary abolitionist @entity149 was her vice presidential running mate in 2012 two women ran for president – @entity86 's then - congresswoman @entity85 and famed tv loudmouth comic @entity93 , who came in second among delegates for the @entity96 nomination			0
that prize went to another woman , physician @entity156			0
overall more than 80 women have been candidates for the @entity13 presidency , and another 60 have sought the second - banana job			2
the first came in 1872 when @entity145 ran for president under the @entity148 banner			0
the legendary abolitionist @entity149 was her running mate			0
the two failed to win electoral votes from any states , but they laid important groundwork both for women and for african - americans – @entity149 was an escaped black slave before winning fame as an orator , social reformer and statesman			0
@entity131 and @entity0 , though , share the distinction of becoming their parties ' official nominees for the vice presidency , a feat no other woman has matched			0
and no female has led the @entity63 or the @entity4 into a presidential election at the top of the ticket .			2

@entity0 *appeared* wednesday night on @entity184 with host @entity23
her *remarks* were a not - so - *veiled* slap at likely @entity63 front - runner @entity10
meanwhile a new @entity44 survey shows deep divide between @entity63 and @entity4 on whether to send a ' madame president ' to the @entity8
@entity4 voters may have been answering the question with @entity108 in mind , *skewing* the numbers
73 per cent of @entity13 adults expect to see a female president in their lifetimes , while only 38 per cent say they hope it happens
another 57 per cent say it does n't matter to them either way
