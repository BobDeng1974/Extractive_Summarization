this is the moment a wildebeest is dragged away from its herd by a ferocious african wild dog before it fell prey to the rest of the pack			1
despite its victim being more than twice its size , the dog was able to launch an attack on the wildebeest , sinking its teeth into its muzzle			0
the carnivore then managed to haul its struggling prey back to the rest of its pack at the @entity17 in @entity18			0
he said that the wildebeest had fought hard , but in the end did not have the stamina to overcome the strength of the pack of wild dogs			2
often confused with hyenas , the dogs are highly endangered and were introduced to the park in 1994 as part of a conservation effort to protect the species - often known as the ' painted dog ' due to the markings on the animals coats			1
game reserve : @entity26 , a guide at the reserve ( pictured ) - located around 165 miles from @entity18 capital @entity25 - captured the dramatic moment on camera conservation : the dogs are highly endangered and were introduced to @entity51 ( pictured ) in 1994 as part of a conservation effort to protect the species the original pack were faced with a host of dangers such as rabies outbreaks , territorial clashes and the odd run in with the park 's lions but are now thriving			1
three hunting packs currently roam the 289 square mile reserve , which is located close to the border with @entity65			0
the dogs live and hunt in packs , and can pursue their prey at speed of up to 40miles an hour for anything between ten minutes to an hour			0
nearly 80 per cent of wild dog hunts end with a kill , compared with lions which manage to kill around 30 per cent of their prey			2
wild dogs often kill their larger prey , such as wildebeest , impalas , gazelle and springbok , by firstly immobilising the victim and then disemboweling them			1
after a successful hunt , the dogs will regurgitate meat for the members of the pack that remained at the den during the hunt , such as the dominant female , older animals and pups			0
