stand - up comedian and actor @entity0 – long - time @entity2 supporter – was shocked by the video footage of fans racially abusing a passenger on the @entity6			1
@entity0 , born in @entity7 to @entity9 parents , witnessed violence and racism on the @entity13 terraces in the 1970s and 1980s and sees the widespread condemnation of the fans ’ actions as a good thing for society			1
at first i thought it was a random thing posted on twitter so i 've been pleasantly surprised that people are making a fuss about it			0
i ’m glad it 's being taken seriously because when you break it down the behaviour is appalling			2
world - wide condemnation of this sort of thing , however small in the grand scheme of things , is a good thing for society			2
everyone has a video camera on their phone these days , linked in to social media , so more cases are exposed and more people are standing up and saying enough is enough			0
it 's good to remind ourselves that it was n't always the case			0
the man attempts to board but is refused entry by supporters travelling to the @entity57 tie in @entity58 the man attempts to board but is refused entry by supporters travelling to the @entity57 tie in @entity58 the man is pushed away from the carriage and is subjected to vile racist chants by the supporters the man attempts to forcibly gain entry to the @entity6 train but struggles with passengers already on board the amateur footage goes on to show passengers in the carriage following the disgraceful incident back in the 1970s and 1980s the violence was far worse			1
i remember as a teenager seeing people being abused or beaten up every two or three games			0
so - called ‘ football fans ’ did this regularly and no one would do a thing – everyone would keep their heads down and stay quiet			1
what was amazing was that man in @entity58 , after being pushed off once tried to get on the train again because he could n't accept what was happening - i know i would have recognised these were nutters and would have just moved along to the next entrance			1
but that 's a pavlovian reaction i 'd have because i 'm used to avoiding drunken behaviour			1
this man just did n't compute			0
you hear the blokes chanting football songs so you 'd assume they 're football fans but i 'd call them fans of alcohol and thuggery , fans of a group mentality where it 's supposedly ok to push a black man off a train and then chant about racism and say ‘ that ’s the way we like it ’			1
it 's alcohol - fuelled behaviour – and that is the problem			2
we tend to forgive people and excuse their behaviour by saying ‘ he ’s had a drink ’ , but in my mind that 's just not acceptable any more			0
comedian @entity0 has condemned the actions of those @entity2 fans on the @entity6 @entity0 , a @entity2 fan , witnessed violence and racism on the @entity13 terraces in the 1970s and 1980s this is not just a football problem			1
these people may identify themselves as football fans - and @entity2 should do everything to keep them away from the club and ban them ( not for life i would add , there 's always room for improvement in all our lives ) – but it 's a wider societal problem			1
@entity2 are owned by a @entity137 and half the players are black or multi national , and as a club have already done so much to curb this behaviour			1
i certainly have not seen this at @entity13 for years			0
we need fans to stand up and show that we will not tolerate behaviour like this			0
i sit near the away fans at @entity2 and we ’ve had issues with people goading the opposition and passing it off as ‘ banter ’			2
kids talk about this is schools about the line between " banter " and offensive and hurtful behaviour			0
but deep down everyone knows when a line is crossed			0
what 's needed is people with a voice to stand up and say that they are crossing the line and should stop			0
it makes me genuinely happy and very hopeful when i see that this is happening			0
the unsavoury scene has overshadowed @entity2 's 1 - 1 @entity57 last 16 draw at @entity167 on tuesday @entity2 defender @entity168 slides on his knees after scoring the opening goal on tuesday night @entity167 goalkeeper @entity171 was unable to stop @entity168 's header from hitting the back of the net @entity167 's @entity175 ( right ) celebrates after cancelling out @entity168 's first - half opener @entity178 goalkeeper @entity177 ( centre ) looks on as @entity175 's header beats him in the second half kick it out chairman @entity183 ( far left ) has condemned the incident and called for action by @entity2 the @entity186 condemned the ' group of so - called @entity2 fans ' and @entity186 deputy chief executive , @entity190 , said : ' i am extremely saddened that such a great football club has had its name dragged into the gutter by a very ignorant minority who seemingly equate supporting @entity2 and cheering for the likes of @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199 , with abusing a fellow passenger on a train who was going about his own business			1
' i am sure that @entity2 will seek to take strong action against the supporters shown in the video as the club works very hard through their community and education programmes			2
' kick it out chairman @entity183 echoed their stance , and said : ' i was shocked that @entity2 fans were still behaving like this			1
' i thought the club had made it quite clear and taken action about stopping any repetition , knowing @entity2 , how hard they 've worked on these matters , with fans as well as players , that it was unlikely to occur			2
' the fact it involved an assault as well , of the individual that they pushed off the train , was even more shocking			0
clearly it sends out a strong signal to , not only @entity2 , but the whole of football , that you can not be complacent and think the actions you 're taking are sufficient to deal with the scourge of racism , sexism , homophobia and anti-semitism			1
we 've got to do a lot more and not be complacent			0
' @entity0 is currently on a @entity242 - wide tour @entity243			2

@entity2 fan @entity0 writes exclusively for @entity245 on racism storm
he has been a regular at @entity13 since the 1970s
@entity2 drew 1 - 1 away at @entity167 in their @entity57 last 16 first *leg*
match has since been overshadowed by unsavoury off - the - field events
footage shows a black man being blocked entry to a @entity6 train
the train was at the @entity261 station and @entity2 fans prevent the man getting aboard , twice pushing him forcibly back on to the platform
they then chant : ' we 're racist , we 're racist and that 's the way we like it '
@entity2 appeal to witnesses for *information* following incident
@entity276 : @entity2 fans ' racist shame is a *throwback* to the @entity281 *culture* *...* we *foolishly* believed this behaviour was a thing of the past
