@entity0 could face some of its hottest temperatures in more than 17 years in the next few days as a number of remote areas brace themselves for the mercury to hit 50 degrees			1
two @entity0 towns broke their records for the hottest january day on wednesday , with @entity9 recording a temperature of 48 degrees and @entity12 47.9 degrees , but @entity14 spokesperson @entity13 said the worst was yet to come			1
' chances are that some areas in @entity17 will see temperatures of around 49 and possibly hitting 50 , ' mr @entity13 told @entity19			0
an ongoing heatwave in @entity0 could see temperatures reach 50 degrees in some remote areas there has only been three occasions when @entity0 saw days of 50 degrees or hotter , the most recent being in @entity0 in 1998 and the other two occasions dating back to january and february in 1960 at @entity27 in @entity28 ' it only needs just a slight change of wind speed for a short period around 2pm and then you wo n't get the temperatures you thought and they will be a degree or half a degree out , ' @entity14 spokesperson @entity13 said ' a lot of temperature records could be broken on friday ; that 's the day when the peak of the heat could occur and there 's a possibility these places could hit 50 degrees			1
' mr @entity45 explained that the extreme , dangerous temperatures were being caused by a huge un-moving hot air mass located above the state			2
' there 's a large pool of hot air sitting over the @entity52 moving ever so slowly			1
it 's just going around and around in an anticlockwise direction instead of heading north , east , south or west , ' he said			0
' we do get these occurring occasionally , but this time what we 're seeing is temperatures getting to record levels in some areas			0
@entity61 is one of them and @entity63 is another that could be at risk			2
' ' @entity66 has also now had 55 consecutive days of no rainfall , that 's not a record ( the longest is 83 days ) , but it is a long dry spell			0
' the @entity14 warns that the towns of @entity61 ( pictured ) and @entity63 in @entity0 , could face 50 degree temperatures on friday pictured in front of an outdoor thermometer with his staff on thursday , owner of the @entity78 at @entity61 , @entity79 ( right ) , said the locals were entirely unconcerned about the potentially record - breaking prediction @entity61 was forecast to reach 48 degrees on thursday , but if temperatures soar higher as the week progresses , the town could beat the state 's all time temperature record of 50.5 degrees that was recorded in @entity86 on february 1998			1
there has only been three occasions when @entity0 saw days of 50 degrees or hotter , the most recent being the aforementioned date in @entity0 , and the other two dating back to january and february in 1960 at @entity27 in @entity28			1
' so if we 're predicting 50 degrees or more for certain areas , that 's a pretty significant deal , ' mr @entity13 said			2
owner of the @entity78 at @entity61 , @entity79 , told @entity19 that the locals were entirely unconcerned about the ongoing heat			1
' it 's pretty normal , it always gets hot out here , ' mr @entity79 told @entity19 when asked if he was worried about the possibility of a 50 degree day			1
' when it goes from 47 degrees down to 45 down here , it feels like the sea breeze is coming in ! ' mr @entity79 said @entity61 , which has a population of under 200 according to the 2006 @entity106 , is known as ' @entity0 's hottest town ' ' the world just kicks along , you just do n't plan to dig holes			1
' there 's a lot of difference between 45 and 47 [ degrees ] â€“ anything above 46 and you can see that things become a lot more critical			0
' at 45 you can walk around			0
if you have to go for a long walk you can with a water bottle , but if it hits 47 you think 's * * * ' and just pack up			0
' when it goes from 47 down to 45 down here , it feels like the sea breeze is coming in ! ' a spokesman from @entity61 's @entity126 repeated the sentiment , telling @entity19 : ' i do n't get any extra work because of that '			0
' they [ the locals ] are used to 45 [ degrees ] , so 48 or 49 is not that different			2
it 's just something new to talk about but it 's no big deal			0
' the heat wave in @entity0 is being caused by a slow - moving , large pool of hot air sitting over the @entity17 region mr @entity13 said that while high temperatures were anticipated to continue in the region for the next few days , they could still just miss the 50 degree mark			1
' it only needs just a slight change of wind speed for a short period around 2pm when we get maximum temperatures and then you wo n't get the temperatures you thought and they will be a degree or half a degree out , ' he said			0
' but we do expect it to remain in the high 40s			0
' ' we are expecting this hot air mass will move into central parts of the @entity155 over the next two to three days and it could move its way into western @entity158 at the end of the week , but there 's no guarantees they would see these sorts of temperatures			2

the @entity14 warns that the remote @entity0 towns of @entity61 and @entity63 could face 50 degree temperatures on friday
a large mass of slow - moving hot air sitting over the @entity52 , has led to an ongoing heat wave
owner of the @entity78 at @entity61 , @entity79 , said the locals were entirely unconcerned about the extreme prediction
