archaeologists are convinced they 've unearthed the secret behind the world 's most famous painting , the @entity4			1
buried beneath the floor of a convent in @entity7 , @entity8 they 've found a skeleton they believe belonged to @entity11 , the model who posed for @entity16 's @entity15 's mysterious masterpiece			1
ancient find : archeologists have found a skeleton they believe belonged to the model who inspired @entity15 's @entity4 an archaeologist digs away at the floor of the medieval convent of @entity24 in @entity7 , where the skeleton was discovered the convent was the burial site of @entity11 , wife of the wealthy @entity7 silk merchant @entity11 , who modelled for @entity15 @entity28 , was the wife of a rich silk merchant named @entity11			1
in @entity8 the @entity4 is known as @entity4			0
most modern historians agree that the lady depicted in the @entity4 was @entity11 , who became a nun after her husband 's death			1
she died in the convent on july 15 , 1542 , aged 63			0
an archeological team began digging at the abandoned convent of @entity24 last year			1
they first had to dig through thick concrete , laid down ahead of plans to turn the convent into an army barracks			0
but they quickly struck gold , finding a crypt they believe to have been @entity4 's final resting place and soon after they unearthed a female - sized human skull			1
the skull was found five feet under the convent 's original floor along with other fragments of human ribs and vertebrae			1
plans to continue the dig were suspended when the team ran out of funds , but they were able to resume last month			2
and this week , they found a human skeleton			0
the team unearthed a skull and other bones last year that they believe belonged to @entity11 the skull was found five feet under the convent 's original floor along with other fragments of human ribs and vertebrae the bones will undergo tests to establish if they match the skull found last year			1
scientists will then compare the dna in the bones with the remains of the model 's two children who were buried nearby in an attempt to authenticate the @entity79 : the enigmatic @entity4 has intrigued millions once they have verified the skeleton and skull belong to the modelf orensic artists will attempt to reconstruct her face to see how it compares to the 500 - year - old version painted by @entity15 - and perhaps solve the riddle of the @entity4 's enigmatic smile in the process			1
archeologist @entity90 , who is in charge of the dig , explained : ' we do n't know yet if the bones belong to one single skeleton or more than one			2
' but this confirms our hypothesis that in @entity101 convent there are still human bones and we can not exclude that among them there are bones belonging to @entity11			1
' the initial discovery - made using ground penetrating radar and ancient maps and documents - came after a foot of modern concrete was removed and unearthed a layer of ancient , 90 - centimeter wide bricks			2
professor @entity90 said of the first discovery : ' this is a very exciting development and the find is consistent with our records and our preliminary research			0
' the crypt we have found is the one that was mentioned in church records from 1495 and was reached via a grate and then a staircase			0
' we also know from those records that in 1625 there was a second crypt and these are the ones we have found			0
' resting place : the courtyard of the @entity24 convent in @entity7 , where archaeologists have been digging present on the dig is @entity135 , who is related to @entity11 and who is also a close friend of @entity137 and former prime minister @entity138			2
speaking after the skull was discovered , she said : ' it was so emotional being here - i did n't think i would get so emotional			0
i am certain that this is the final resting place of @entity11			2
it is not the first time that professor @entity90 has used such techniques in his work - last year similar methods were used to locate and identify the remains of @entity149 , another @entity150 master			0
last year in a @entity153 - style mystery professor @entity151 also claimed that a hidden message could be seen in the eyes of the @entity4 after examining them with a high powered magnifying glass			0
the @entity4 is an oil on panel painting owned by the @entity161 government and the image is so widely recognised and caricatured that it is considered the most famous painting in the world			0
@entity15 started to paint it in 1503 or 1504 and finished it in 1519 , shortly before his death , and after he had moved to @entity161 .			2
