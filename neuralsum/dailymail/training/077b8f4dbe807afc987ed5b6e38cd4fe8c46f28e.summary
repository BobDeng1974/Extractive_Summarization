@entity2 actress and adventurer @entity0 arrived at the @entity4 on tuesday after chugging along on a tractor from @entity6 through @entity7 and across the frozen wastes of @entity9			1
the globe - trotting new mother of a 10 - month - old baby said the the 16 - day , 1,500 mile trip across the largest single mass of ice on earth from @entity19 's @entity18 base to the @entity4 had been tough			1
driving the huge red @entity21 tractor over the rugged , icy landscape at an average speed of about 6mph an hour was ' like rodeo riding '			2
after 17 gruelling days in @entity9 , ' @entity26 ' @entity0 has reached the @entity4 ' @entity26 ' @entity0 has reached the @entity4 aboard a @entity28 5610 tractor ' it 's quite emotional , i 'm very happy , ' @entity29 told @entity32 by satellite telephone shortly after arriving at the @entity4 and fulfilling a decade - long dream			1
' it feels quite magical really , to have made this happen and arrived here ! ' @entity29 said the worst part of the trip was ' the day that i was driving for hours and hours and could not go faster than between 0.5 and 3mph '			1
' i really was worried then that the expedition could come to a halt if conditions would get just a little bit worse			0
' now she has to do the return trip			2
it will be a race to make it home to the @entity2 for @entity46 but the ' return journey to the base will be faster because the tracks of the tractor will be frozen up and it will be easier to drive			1
' @entity0 began her trip in 2005 , taking four years to drive from her home village in the @entity2 to @entity54 at the southern tip of @entity7 - and then missed the boat that was due to take her to @entity9 for the final leg due to delays			1
@entity0 ( front ) with the @entity62 team and @entity63 tractor the @entity2 actress and adventurer arrived after driving the vehicle across the frozen wastes of @entity9 frustrated , the former theatre actress spent the next four years back in the @entity2 , writing a book , working as a motivational speaker and desperately trying to get back on a tractor			1
with sponsorship from @entity21 and other companies , she finally made it			0
@entity0 travelled alone through @entity7 , but in @entity9 the tractor needed to creep forward day and night , so @entity78 mechanic @entity77 shared the driving			2
in total , she was accompanied by a team of seven , including crew who are filming the journey for a documentary			0
asked whether this was the end of her crazy adventures on a tractor , @entity0 's infectious laugh bubbled through the crackly satphone : ' yes			2
i think this is the best adventure on a tractor that one can come up with			2
' she now plans to write a children 's book and produce the movie of her journey			0
the @entity9 2 expedition culminates @entity101 's dream to drive a tractor to the @entity4 after a day 's rest at the @entity4 , the @entity9 2 team will embark on the return journey to @entity106 on the @entity9 coast			1
asked what she is looking forward to most about getting back to civilisation , she replied : ' to go back home to my happy ever after and to hug my little daughter			0
' @entity0 's daughter , @entity114 , has been in the care of her partner , airline pilot @entity116			0
cradling the baby in a tractor shed in @entity54 as @entity0 made final checks before leaving for @entity9 , he told @entity32 she had his full support			0
' we 'll be there to meet her at the airport when she comes home , ' he said			0
@entity0 's tractor is named @entity9 2 in honour of legendary explorer sir @entity129 , who travelled to the @entity4 on a tractor in 1958			1
his vehicle was equipped with full tracks , however , while @entity0 's has normal inflatable tyres which have been slightly modified for better grip on the snow and ice			0
while fulfilling her own long - held dream , @entity0 carried with her thousands of ' dreams ' collected from people in @entity7 and around the world			0
@entity0 pictured in her tractor at a workshop outside @entity145 in the @entity146 before her epic journey scraps of paper and emails have been converted into digital form and will be placed in the belly of a big snowman she will build at the pole -- to be opened only in 80 years time			1
' i want to turn them into a beautiful time capsule of the dreams of the world so that in the future children and people can read something about our dreams and not only about politics or war , ' she said			0
@entity169 holds people back from pursuing their dreams , she says , and many believe that ' putting them into reality is as impossible as driving a tractor to the @entity4 '			1
' the tractor for me symbolises this very down to earth fact that if you want to do something , maybe you will not be so fast but if you keep going and keep your sense of humour you will get there			0
