under the new @entity195 , anyone with an internet connection could potentially face legal threats from @entity192 studios for illegally downloading movies , tv shows , and music			0
consumer group choice labelled the plan , which was compiled by @entity4 's largest internet service providers ( @entity202 's ) at the request of the federal government , as ' medieval ' and said it ' reads like a horror movie script '			1
the scheme could come into affect as soon as september this year			0
under the proposed code , a three - strikes system would be introduced for illegal downloads			2
customers suspected of illegally downloading content will be sent a series of notices from their @entity202 's - a warning , an ' education ' notice , and a final notice			2
' the code means that anyone with an internet connection could be under threat from legal action			0

@entity129 has exclusive rights to the fantasy series leading to criticism by consumer groups 55 % of @entity4 who downloaded content illegally , including @entity237 spin - off @entity235 ( above ) said it was because of a lack of access the @entity241 , the industry body backing the proposed code , released a statement last week emphasising the ' public education ' elements of the code , but noted that the scheme did provide a process of ' facilitated preliminary discovery '			1

' when we asked people the reason they downloaded , 55 % said it was because of a lack of access , and that they had first tried to obtain the content through legal sources , ' she said			0
ms @entity221 said that 55 % of those that downloaded illegally had tried to obtain content through legal sources ' consumers find it very frustrating when they know the content is online , but that they are blocked from accessing it			0
it makes very little sense to them			0
' the code indicates that rights holders need to be working towards initiatives which ' include continuing efforts of @entity293 to ensure timely and ready availability to @entity4 consumers of lawful content alternatives			1
' however , ms @entity221 said that while it was fantastic to see new streaming service such as @entity131 available in @entity4 , the country was still very behind the kind of access others around the world enjoyed			1
