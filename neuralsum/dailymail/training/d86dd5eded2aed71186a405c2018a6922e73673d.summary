@entity1 worst fears were realised on sunday as @entity2 sides the @entity3 and @entity4 dug up the @entity6 pitch less than a week before @entity9 's @entity8 qualifier against @entity10			1
the @entity4 beat the @entity3 31 - 17 in front of a packed crowd but mud was seen flying up on a regular basis as the gridiron stars pounded their way around the turf just six days before @entity1 's men are due to play			1
the @entity9 manager met @entity6 executives to voice his worries that his players may be risking injury on that pitch when they face the @entity26 - ranked no 36 side			1
loose dirt flies flies up at @entity6 as @entity4 ' @entity28 returns the ball against @entity3 the @entity6 surface is visibly cut up as the @entity2 star go through their paces on sunday night although rain fell beforehand the pitch was relatively dry , but dirt visibly flew from the surface when players hit full tilt and as a whole it was clearly in poor condition at the end of four quarters			2
this is the second @entity45 game in a fortnight on the field and @entity49 quarterback @entity48 noted it was ' pretty cut up ' last time out - and he does n't have to worry about the impact a bumpy surface will have on a round ball			0
after inspecting the pitch this week @entity1 said it was ' not in the best of nick ' - and that was before the @entity59 announced next year it will host three more @entity2 games at the stadium			2
@entity3 's @entity62 ( above ) slips on the @entity6 surface during the clash the @entity4 beat the @entity3 31 - 17 in the second @entity2 game at @entity6 in a fortnight he had already criticised the scheduling of this match so close to an @entity9 game , which he expects should take priority			1
' i do n't really think you could expect me to say , " excellent , delighted , well done , " , @entity1 said			2
' but i 'm realistic , i 'm pragmatic and this match has been organised for a period of time now			0
the pitch , unfortunately , is not in the best of nick , which we 're all a bit unhappy with			0
i think it will get put right			0
@entity81 remove divots from the pitch at half - time during the @entity2 match getting straight to work the @entity6 groundstaff race to prepare the pitch for @entity9 's clash with @entity10 ' if asked if it was a good thing or not , i would have to say not			1
i can do nothing about it and we wo n't use it as an excuse			0
' the ground staff will be working their socks off from sunday evening through to saturday to make it as good as it can possibly be and we will accept that and have to adapt			0
' after sunday 's match @entity4 defensive end @entity100 said of the pitch : ' it was a little muddy and tough but we had our long studs in and adjusted well			2
there was n’t much slipping and sliding out there and some guys changed their cleats at half - time			0
’ @entity9 boss @entity1 did n't seem pleased with the @entity2 match taking place at @entity6			1
