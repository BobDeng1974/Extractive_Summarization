@entity7 , 58 , had a drooping mouth following an operation to remove a 5mm - long benign tumour from his ear in 2005			1
a nerve was damaged during the surgery leaving him suffering from facial paralysis and unable to smile			1
it also left him unable to fully close his eyes			1
@entity7 can now smile again after 20 operations including surgery to transplant leg tissue into his cheek mr @entity7 suffered facial paralysis during surgery to remove a tumour from his ear			1
he is pictured before undergoing reconstructive surgery he has now undergone 20 operations , including three facelifts , and a ‘ smile transplant ’ which involved having tissue from his leg implanted into the corners of his mouth			1
he also had surgery to insert two small gold weights into his eyelids so he could sleep with his eyes properly shut			1
mr @entity7 , an accountant from @entity37 , @entity38 , said : ‘ it ’s changed my life			1
i literally have n’t been able to stop smiling since the operation was deemed a success			0
‘ i did n’t want to go out because people stared at me and kids asked what the matter was			0
now it ’s just normal to look at me			0
‘ it ’s taken a long time , it ’s been about eight years but it ’s come right			0
‘ it ’s been worth it , there ’s no doubt about that			0
it ’s changed my life			0
‘ i thought i ’d never be able to smile again			2
now i can talk to people and have a laugh and joke with them and they know now that i ’m smiling			0
‘ the things they can do nowadays are unbelievable			0
mr @entity7 says that he was always laughing and smiling before a nerve in his face was damaged during tumour removal surgery ‘ i thought i ’d never be able to smile again			1
‘ the entire right side of my face was left drooping and i stopped smiling completely			0
’ he added : ‘ even when i was happy or laughing at a joke i still looked grumpy			0
‘ people felt awkward around me because i could n’t laugh along or smile at jokes			2
‘ i used to laugh all the time , but i was n’t able to do that anymore			0
‘ the worst thing was when it came to having my picture taken and trying to smile for the camera			2
pictured in 2007 before reconstructive surgery mr @entity7 could not smile or close his eyes properly the grandfather , who is pictured with his wife @entity76 , says that he avoided going out before his reconstructive surgery as people would stare at him ‘ children would stare at me and then ask their mum loudly “ what ’s wrong with that man ? ” ‘ in the end i used my hand to prop up my cheek so it was less noticeable			1
‘ i used to walk around with my hand stuck to my face because i was so conscious about my face			0
’ mr @entity7 ’s nightmare began in may 2005 when he was refereeing a football match and noticed ringing in his ears and began suffering balance problems			2
he underwent an mri scan which found he had a benign acoustic neuroma - a tumour - in his ear			2
following surgery mr @entity7 is now able to share a joke with his wife again in october that year the tumour was removed , but a nerve was damaged and he suffered facial palsy – paralysis of the face			1
after three facelifts at @entity108 ’s @entity107 , mr @entity7 was referred to @entity109 , a consultant @entity110 and @entity111			1
he operated on mr @entity112 twice in 2007 and again in 2008 to transplant tissue from his leg into his cheek			1
both operations failed but the third transplant in november 2009 was deemed a success and mr @entity7 started intensive physiotherapy to strengthen his facial muscles			1
the grandfather , who lives with his wife of 33 years , @entity76 , 56 , added : ‘ when @entity125 first looked at my face , he said “ we will sort it out ”			0
‘ my smile finally came back bit by bit as i had the physio			2
‘ i had to clench my teeth to smile at first			2
then the whole face started to move			0
‘ now i can talk to people and have a laugh and joke with them and they know now that i am smiling			0
‘ the nicest thing for me now is that i can once again smile at my wife			2
it was depressing not being able to share a laugh with her for so many years			0
’ mr @entity109 said : ‘ it is quite a rare operation , i have carried out only eight in total			0
‘ with @entity7 , both the nerves and muscle in the affected side of the face had gone , so we needed to bring in a new muscle and use another nerve			1
plastic and @entity151 inserted tiny gold weights into mr @entity7 's eyelids to allow him to close his eyes properly again ‘ it takes about three months for the nerve to recover and the muscle starts to work			1
‘ to achieve the best results it takes a lot of hard work and physiotherapy after the operation as the patient learns how to smile again			2
‘ initially the patient has to bite their teeth to smile but fairly soon they learn to do it without biting their teeth			0
‘ @entity7 now has a spontaneous smile			1
