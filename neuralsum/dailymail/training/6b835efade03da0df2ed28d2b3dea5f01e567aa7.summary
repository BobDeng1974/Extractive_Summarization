who ’d be an @entity1 captain ? @entity2 gets out on the right side of bed			1
your match - winning spinner quits			0
your star persona becomes non grata			0
your rock at @entity10 falls ill. your coach packs it in			0
you lose at home to @entity14			0
then @entity15 hands you a surface with less life in it than one of @entity21 ’s press conferences			1
the irony of the @entity23 is that @entity24 enjoyed one of his best matches as captain			1
i know , i know : this is not necessarily saying much			0
and there was still plenty he could have done differently			0
but he was inventive with his field settings , treated @entity35 ’s off - spin with respect , and even proved his sense of humour has n’t deserted him by producing an uncanny impersonation of @entity40			1
making people smile wo n’t affect his chances of holding on to the test captaincy , though the japes suggested a sense of perspective			1
we could all do with a bit of that			0
on his knees : @entity24 had a good test as @entity1 captain but could not inspire that elusive victory in any case , the alternative was bursting into tears			1
when @entity24 compared the surface to the one served up by the unfortunate @entity60 , head groundsman at the @entity61 at @entity62 , in december 2012 – when @entity63 had to beat @entity1 to salvage a draw – he confirmed just how over-my - dead - body grudging the @entity15 pitch really was			1
@entity68 cricket needs something to cheer about right now			0
the test team are in the middle of their most winless sequence for over 20 years , and many fans feel alienated following the @entity75 affair			2
suddenly , we ’re forced to recall just how good @entity1 had it for the vast majority of @entity80 ’s reign			1
hell , it used to be the case that we expected to beat @entity83			0
the visit of @entity63 , complete with abysmal overseas record and inexplicably cautious captain , appeared to offer a crack at redemption			1
and then @entity89 , no doubt with the blessing of the suits at @entity93 , produced a track that would have neutered @entity95			0
sometimes , you ca n’t catch a break			0
the harsh fact remains that @entity1 have won none of their last nine tests , and @entity24 has not scored a century for 26 innings			1
and while he was unlucky to be bowled behind his legs , he exposed his leg stump because he was so concerned about moving across to the off stump to deal with his tendency to nick good - length balls			0
in trying to solve one issue , he created another			0
lord ’s is shaping up as a crucial moment in @entity24 ’s career			1
if two more batting failures are combined with a draw or an @entity115 win , his apologists will be running out of straws to clutch			1
a century in a draw would help ; a pair of failures in an @entity1 win would not count against him either			1
but it is the combination – no runs , no wins – that becomes debilitating			2
@entity1 actually had two openings in @entity127 to @entity63 ’s one			1
the first came when @entity63 slipped to 346 for nine in their first innings , only for their last pair to add 111			1
the second was on the final morning , when @entity133 bowled @entity21			1
@entity134 , lonely walk : @entity24 had another batting failure at @entity15 as his run drought continues for more cricket - related snippets , feel free to go to twitter.com / the_topspin @entity63 ’s opening , by contrast , lasted much longer , as @entity1 recovered from 202 for seven to 496 all out			1
but it was the collapse from 134 for one that will be of most concern			0
@entity1 suffered the same fate twice against @entity14 at @entity147			1
collapses are what mediocre sides do , no matter whether your @entity151 can dig you out of a hole			0
there is clearly spirit in this @entity1 side			1
we saw it on the last day in @entity159 , and we saw it during the world - record stand of 198 between @entity162 and @entity163			2
but their frustration with the authorities is palpable : both @entity14 and @entity63 have been greeted by surfaces more akin to @entity168 and @entity169 , and next is up will be another flat’un at @entity171			1
at some point over the next few weeks , @entity163 or @entity172 may keel over			0
five tests in 42 days is bad enough – but five tests in 42 days on pitches designed to help the host venue ’s bottom line rather than the home team ’s bowling figures is simply unaccountable			1
raising a smile : @entity24 ended the first test on a light - hearted note by running in to bowl like @entity40 ( right ) there is a less anglo - centric reason to grumble , too			1
@entity21 himself made the point on sunday evening that , when you play abroad , you expect to encounter the home conditions			2
it ’s what makes test cricket so engrossing			2
right now , @entity68 pitches seem to be going the way of the @entity197 – slower , lower , more heart - breaking , more injury - inducing			2
most crucially , the cricket becomes boring			0
@entity93 may have got the fifth day they so obviously craved , but at what cost to the game as a whole ? as this column never tires of pointing out , when the business ousts the sport , the sport invariably suffers			2
before the @entity210 , @entity21 suggested that the ‘ processes ’ were more important than the results			2
the game over , he was at it again : ‘ you do n’t always want results in your favour but what you want is to see the team improving			0
’ he makes it sound as if @entity63 are a team in constant transition , forever preparing for the next battle while ignoring the current one			1
@entity63 ’s fans may think they deserve better			2
part of the process : @entity21 is adamant @entity63 are more interested in the means rather than the end @entity230 is back in the @entity1 squad , less than a year after his left - arm spin was pummelled by @entity233 at @entity234			1
this episode has generally attracted the kinds of adjectives and nouns more readily associated with a horror movie , but it seems @entity230 can see his analysis for 8 - 0 - 53 - 0 for what it is			2
asked on sunday what he had learned from the experience , he replied : ‘ that the sun will come up the next day			0
it is not the @entity247			0
’ the @entity248 likes him even more after that			0
a positive spin : @entity230 ( left ) , bowling for @entity251 against @entity252 on sunday , has been recalled by @entity1 when @entity253 was reported by match officials following the one - day international at @entity171 in may because of a suspect bowling action , @entity14 privately fumed that this was all @entity1 ’s fault			1
now the @entity258 have banned him			0
it ’s all very well turning a sense of grievance to your advantage , as @entity14 did for the rest of their stay in @entity1 , but at some point the basic mechanics of the game will assert themselves			2
you probably ca n’t blame @entity1 for that			2
blame game : @entity253 of @entity14 ( left ) has been banned by the @entity258 because of his suspect action if you ’re at a loose end next week , you could do a lot worse than head for @entity275 , the stunning venue carved out of the @entity277 by sir @entity278 in 1992			0
there , from thursday july 24 through to saturday july 26 , the words and @entity281 cricket and literature festival will be taking place – including a special celebration of @entity286 , who was born 100 years ago in february			0
it all sounds like great fun			0

@entity24 was inventive with his field settings in the first test
he even managed to raise a smile with *impression* of @entity40 bowling
a combination of two failures and a @entity63 win at @entity304 *'s* world be a *disaster*
the pitches are making games go five days but at a cost to the sport
@entity21 seems to be looking to future while ignoring present
@entity230 seems positive after @entity1 recall
