it was the night after @entity1 had been put to the sword by @entity3 and @entity4 was at home in turmoil			1
he was trying to unwind by watching television but his mind was back at @entity10			0
@entity4 had squandered three glorious chances during a 3 - 0 defeat that left @entity1 in 10th place and he felt personally responsible			1
@entity4 rediscovered his goal scoring form after watching footage of his misses against @entity3 the forward laughs with @entity18 ( left ) ahead of @entity1 's @entity20 clash with @entity21 @entity4 could not find a way past an inspired @entity23 in december 's 3 - 0 defeat at @entity10 the @entity26 international reacts after missing three golden chances against the @entity29 ' arch rivals some players are able to move on swiftly but @entity4 had been sent clips of his duel with @entity23 by @entity1 ’s analytics department and he wanted to see how he had been outwitted , so he pressed ‘ play ’			1
he watched them so much it was as if they were on a permanent loop			0
it made uncomfortable viewing , but triggered the required response			0
on december 14 , @entity4 had just three goals to his credit but he will face @entity21 in the @entity20 this evening having moved his tally impressively to 10			1
that bleak afternoon in @entity44 was a watershed			0
‘ that day for me was massive , ’ said the @entity26 international			1
‘ i had a few chances to win us the game and i missed them			1
i went home and watched the clips over and over again			0
i watched it just to see what i could have done better			0
‘ @entity3 was a low day because everyone at this club wants to win those games and i had missed the chances that would have helped us do that			1
it was definitely a real low and i had to pick myself up quickly			0
’ @entity4 responded by scoring a brace in @entity1 's next game , a 2 - 0 @entity62 victory against @entity63 the 20 - year - old followed that up with the match - winning goal against @entity68 in the @entity69 despite @entity1 eventually being beaten , @entity4 scored against @entity70 in the @entity71 semi-final two goals immediately after at @entity63 , in a @entity71 quarter - final , helped rebuild his confidence but it was his finish in the @entity78 win at @entity68 that demonstrated progress ; when @entity80 sent him scurrying through on goal , he did n’t look like missing			1
‘ the manager told me i was up front against @entity63 and i was really focused , ’ @entity4 explained			1
‘ i wanted to improve my finishing and said next time i will be a bit more relaxed			0
‘ i said to myself the next time i get into the position like i did against @entity3 that i would just stay calm if that chance came			1
‘ my form has been a bit stop - start but for a young player it is natural			2
if i want to get to the next level , i need to be consistent			0
i have got 10 goals but i could easily have had 15 if i ’d taken half of my chances			2
when the penny drops hopefully that will improve my game			2
’ sterling wheels away after netting against @entity101 at @entity102 for his fifth @entity69 goal @entity4 celebrates after scoring against @entity104 to send @entity1 into the @entity62 quarter - finals @entity4 was on target again as @entity1 put pressure on top four rivals @entity108 with a win at @entity110 's @entity4 has been a hot topic for much of @entity1 ’s season , primarily because the contract he has been offered by the club — one which @entity116 recently described as ‘ a wonderful deal ’ — remains unsigned			1
the 20 - year - old , however , insists it is not a distraction			2
‘ i speak to my representative every day and he has told me to concentrate on playing football and he and the club will deal with it , ’ said @entity4			2
‘ hopefully it will be done soon			0
i ’m focused on winning games and trying to do my best for this football club			0
’ @entity116 is expected to name a young side in @entity128 ahead of the weekend 's clash with @entity130 @entity4 and @entity1 team - mates practice during training as their recent resurgence continues it remains to be seen whether @entity4 starts as @entity1 look to defend their 1 - 0 first - leg lead as @entity116 will need to make changes , given that his side face @entity130 56 hours after they return from @entity139			1
@entity116 travelled to @entity140 without 10 established players , including @entity142 ( ankle ) , @entity144 and the rested @entity80 , and he accepted that @entity146 ’s side will have an advantage for a game which will start at noon			2
‘ there was n’t a great deal we could do about it , ’ said @entity116			0
‘ the @entity20 is tough , especially when you do n’t get help			2
