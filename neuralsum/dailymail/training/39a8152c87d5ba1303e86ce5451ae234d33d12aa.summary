by @entity0 a new @entity2 study has found mixing alcohol with energy drinks increased revellers ' appetite to binge drink mixing energy drinks with alcohol increases a person 's urge to down more booze , leaving them at risk of assault , serious injury and one night stands , experts have today warned			1
a new study has examined the effects of mixing high - caffeine soft drinks with vodka			1
and the findings show revellers ' appetite for alcohol was boosted when compared to other soft drink mixers			1
@entity2 scientists said the increased desire to binge drink leaves people at risk of dangerous levels of intoxication , which may leave them susceptible to alcohol - related injuries , attacks and one night stands			1
the research found those who drank caffeinated cocktails had a ' stronger desire to keep drinking than if they drank alcohol on its own '			0
it noted the effect was noticeable even when the mix of energy drink and a spirit was diluted with fruit juice			0
but the experts warned there may be added cause for concern because the restrictions on volunteers drinking in experiments mean the problem could be much worse out of the lab in pubs and clubs			0
psychologist @entity57 , associate professor of psychology at @entity59 in @entity60 said : ' a greater urge to drink has substantial implications when we think about the nature of drinking episodes			0
' as people become intoxicated , even at low levels , they show less inhibitions and are likely to drink more in a cycle of greater intoxication			0
' of course , the drunker you get , the more likely you are to get injured , be a victim or perpetrator of an assault , or even drive home while drunk , let alone making bad choices about the people you associate with and possible sexual behaviour			0
' the study saw 46 women and 29 men drink either a cocktail containing 60 ml of vodka and a market - leading energy drink or the same measure with soda water instead			2
both cocktails were mixed with 200 ml of a fruit drink in the random experiment that compared their urges before and afterwards with questionnaires and a breath alcohol concentration ( @entity96 ) test			2
co-leader of the study @entity99 , a fellow at the @entity100 's @entity101 and well - being , said : ' we found that when people drink alcohol and energy drinks that they have a stronger desire to keep drinking than if they drank alcohol on its own			1
' this would mean that someone who drinks alcohol and energy drinks would want to keep drinking more than their friends who do n't			2
' their results are published in the online journal @entity117 : @entity118			0
she added : ' what we ca n't say is whether this translates into people drinking more			0
' obviously other factors would play a role there - people can over-ride their desires and many things play into a decision about whether someone would keep drinking or not			0
' however , if it did translate into greater alcohol consumption , we would expect to see people who drink alcohol and energy drinks drinking more than their peers who do n't			1
' the study comes after other similar research indicated a link between energy cocktails to binge drinking in young people			2
the researchers warned cocktails containing energy drinks could leave people more susceptible to attacks , serious injury and one night stands , by encouraging their appetite for alcohol and resulting in dangerous levels of intoxication			1
file picture ms @entity99 said : ' a number of studies show that young adults who mix alcohol with energy drinks have higher levels of alcohol consumption than their peers who do n't mix energy drinks with alcohol , and some studies suggest that this practice increases the risk of binge drinking			1
' however , it may simply be the case that people who drink more often are more likely to drink alcohol and energy drinks among other things			1
' yet if it is the case that energy drinks increase binge drinking , the popularity of alcohol and energy drinks could exacerbate alcohol - related harms among young people , particularly harms related to intoxication , such as car accidents and injuries from fights or falls			1
' ' as people become intoxicated , even at low levels , they show less inhibitions and are likely to drink more in a cycle of greater intoxication ' - psychologist @entity57 other research conducted in @entity2 indicated that the risk of harm increased generally when people were drinking energy drinks			1
the scientists referred to @entity191 , where laws have been introduced banning the sale of energy drinks to under - 18s			2
they called for governments to do more in creating policy that helps to avoid the potential bad effects of widespread over-consumption of the energy drink cocktails			0
they also warned that their study was not a true reflection of the impact binge drinking had outside the laboratory due to regulations			0
professor @entity57 said : ' [ it 's ] worth noting that the very low levels of alcohol and energy drinks used in these types of experiments are due to the restraints of ethics committees , yet people are using far more than this on average out on the street			1
' this difference between what is acceptable in a strictly controlled and monitored experiment versus unregulated pubs and clubs tells us about the worrying degree to which unsafe behaviour is occurring and the need for regulators to act			0
' @entity227 , @entity229 @entity228 director general , said : ' the authors acknowledge that this study does not establish a link between energy drink consumption and increased alcohol consumption			2
' however , anybody drinking alcohol should do so in moderation , whether or not it â€™s mixed with an energy drink			0

study found revellers ' appetite for alcohol was boosted when they mixed energy drinks with vodka , compared with soft drinks
@entity2 researchers warned increasing the desire to binge drink could leave people at risk of alcohol - related injuries , attacks and one night stands
