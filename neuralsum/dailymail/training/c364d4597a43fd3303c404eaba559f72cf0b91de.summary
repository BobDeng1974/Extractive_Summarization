by @entity0 published : 12:08 est , 19 july 2013 updated : 11:59 est , 21 july 2013 @entity0 got impatient waiting for baby and visited the beauty salon for numerous treatments as the world waits for news of the royal baby , we may all be getting a bit impatient , but if you 're feeling frustrated , imagine how @entity11 is feeling			1
i do n't have to imagine as i know exactly how it feels to be overdue - my baby was 16 days late ! when you are told your due date early in pregnancy you become fixated on that date , everything revolves around that day , 20 weeks to go , 2 weeks to go , two days to go and then suddenly that all important date comes and goes and you 're left in limbo			1
every call you make is answered with ' are you in labour ? ' and your @entity23 becomes filled with messages asking ' any sign of this baby yet ? '			2
it started to drive me crazy , to a point i stopped making calls and even put a message on @entity23 advising people not to ask if the baby had arrived as if it had i would let them know			2
luckily i only had eager friends and family waiting on my baby 's arrival , poor @entity11 has not only a country , but most of the world waiting for her happy news			1
but no matter how much she may will this baby to make an appearance , the truth is that the baby will only arrive when it 's ready			1
i 'm sure @entity11 has been bombarded with advice from mothers telling her what methods brought on their labours , well i tried them all , long walks , bumpy roads , pineapple , curries , raspberry leaf capsules and endlessly bouncing on my birthing ball , but nothing would budge my little girl			1
when i reached 41 weeks i had an appointment at the local birth centre where i had reflexology and acupressure , i was also given what is called a ' cervical sweep ' , i 'll not go into details but all i 'll say is it was certainly not one of the most pleasant experiences of my life ! i left the centre feeling quite positive and was told this could help bring on labour in the next 24 to 48 hours			2
but two days later there was still no sign of the little one			2
so , as much as the sweep was not enjoyable , i would do anything to get this baby out so back i went for another one and then a third , but yet again no joy			2
she had ' almost all on offer ' and when she went into hospital she was so dolled up she looked like a @entity86 by this stage the impatience was starting to drive me mad , every day seemed to last a lifetime but the only thing that kept me sane was keeping busy			0
i arranged to do something every single day , i met friends for lunch , went shopping , went to the cinema , walked endlessly round the park and made several visits to the beautician			0
in fact i called into the beauticians so often i had almost all of the treatments on offer			0
i had my toenails and fingernails painted , maternity massages , hair extensions and even false eyelashes , so by the time i was taken into hospital i looked like a pregnant @entity86			1
the day before i went into hospital to be induced was the worst day of all			0
my bump was so enormous i actually thought my stomach might explode , i could n't sleep properly and could n't bend down to even put my socks on			0
i was tired , hot , huge and extremely frustrated			0
what made it worse was that one of my friends from my antenatal course , who was due two weeks after me , had gone into labour that morning			0
i cried most of that day and even called the hospital , begging for them to take me in , but despite my pleas they said i had to wait one more day			0
it was not just me who was feeling frustrated , my poor other half was just as anxious as me to meet our little one , and he also had to put up with my emotional outbursts			0
therefore my sympathies are not just with @entity11 , but @entity131 also , although at least he does n't have a giant bump to contend with			0
as baby was approaching 16 days late , @entity0 felt her bump so enormous her stomach might explode so finally , after 14 days , endless beauty treatments , far too many curries and an overdose of raspberry leaf tea , on the 9th april i waddled into @entity139 , with my fake hair and eyelashes , and started to get excited about finally seeing my baby			1
but she was stubborn and refused to budge for another two days			2
finally on 11th april , 16 days past my due date , my beautiful baby girl @entity144 arrived into this world			1
i still had my false eyelashes on but after two days of labour i was far from glamorous and refused to let a camera near me			1
unfortunately for @entity11 , i do n't think she will be able to avoid the cameras for long but until the royal baby arrives my advice to her is to keep busy , go for long walks , get pampered and enjoy getting some sleep as you 'll not be getting much of that over the next few months			1
she felt in limbo as her due date came and went , she could n't bend down and was totally exhausted			0
