hundreds of thousands of genetically modified mosquitoes are awaiting federal approval for release into the @entity3 as part of an experiment aimed at reducing the risk of dengue fever			1
mosquito control officials have requested the @entity10 's sign off on the experiment that would be the first of its kind in the @entity13 some residents of the tourist town of @entity16 worry though on how much research has been done to determine the risks of releasing genetically modified mosquitoes on the @entity21 ' fragile ecosystem			1
let us go ! an entomological technician with the @entity24 , sorts and counts dead mosquitoes in @entity16 , where officials are hoping to release genetically modified mosquitoes into the wild officials are targeting the @entity31 mosquitoes because they can spread dengue fever , a disease health officials thought had been eradicated in the @entity13 until 93 cases originated in the @entity34 in 2009 and 2010			1
the trial planned by mosquito control officials and the @entity39 company @entity35 would release non-biting male mosquitoes that have been genetically modified to pass along a birth defect that kill their progeny before reaching maturity			1
the idea is that they will mate with wild females and their children will die before reproducing			1
after a few generations , @entity16 's aedes aegypti population would die off , reducing the dengue fever risk without using pesticides and at relatively a low cost , the proponents say			1
there is no vaccine for dengue fever			1
' the science of it , i think , looks fine			0
it 's straight from setting up experiments and collecting data , ' said @entity64 , pointing to research @entity35 has had published in peer - reviewed scientific journals			2
he inherited the project when he took the lead at the @entity69 in mid- 2011			0
genetic adaptions : an aedes aegypti mosquito is seen feeding on a woman 's arm while the ones genetically modified would be non-biting males that pass along a birth defect killing their progeny before reaching maturity the district 's website says the modified genes will disappear from the environment after the mosquitoes carrying it die , resulting in no permanent change to the wild mosquito population			1
the district also says that the mosquito species is n't native to the @entity34 , nor is it an integral food source for other animals			0
dengue fever is a viral disease that inflicts severe flu - like symptoms — the joint pain is so severe its nickname is ' breakbone fever			1
' it is n't fatal but victims are then susceptible at subsequent exposures to dengue hemorrhagic fever , which can be			2
' it 's very uncomfortable			2
you ache all over , you have a terrible fever , ' said @entity103 , a @entity16 resident whose dengue fever symptoms lasted more than a week in 2009			1
@entity103 is among those concerned about the @entity16 trial			2
he worries the modified genetic material will somehow be passed to humans or the ecosystem , and he wants more research done			2
he and other @entity16 residents also chafe at the fact that the project was in the works long before it was made public late last year			2
no vaccine : influenza vaccines are seen before a worker while there is no vaccine for dengue fever which causes similar non-fatal symptoms but also makes victims susceptible to dengue hemorrhagic fever , which is only female mosquitoes bite , so the modified genetic material would n't be passed on to humans , mosquito control and @entity35 officials said			1
they also say they 're being transparent about their data and the trial			0
real estate agent @entity132 has collected more than 117,700 signatures on a petition she posted on @entity135 against the trial			0
most come from outside the @entity34 , which @entity137 says shows that tourists do n't support the mosquito control district			0
' we are dependent here on our tourists , and people from all over the country have been sending the message , ' de @entity137 said			0
a @entity147 professor who studies mosquito control said @entity35 's technology works and evidence from the company 's experiments elsewhere show it can control mosquito populations , but it 's not clear whether its methods are as effective at controlling the risk of disease transmission			2
@entity157 of the @entity3 @entity158 also said it would take repeated releases of modified mosquitoes for the program to work , and the public outcry against genetically modified organisms , even when it 's irrational , may be insurmountable			1
growing problem : a field inspector with the @entity24 tests a sprayer used to spray pesticides which have unfortunately become less effective on mosquitoes today ' the public resistance and the need to reach some agreement between mosquito control and the public , i see that as a very significant issue , outside of the ( operating ) costs , since this is not just a one - time thing , ' @entity157 said			2
the @entity31 has shown resistance to pesticides used to control other species , and is the most difficult for the district to manage			0
common in the @entity185 and the @entity186 , it lurks in standing water around homes and businesses and can breed in containers as small as bottle caps			0
district inspectors go door - to - door to remove the standing water where they breed , a time - consuming task			0
the district spends roughly $ 1 million a year to suppress @entity31 , 10 to 15 percent of the agency 's budget , @entity64 said			0
' unfortunately , control of @entity31 is a never - ending job , ' said @entity201 , the mosquito control district 's research director			0
in the trial , thousands of male mosquitoes bred by @entity35 would be released in a handful of @entity16 blocks where the @entity31 is known to breed ; the number of mosquitoes in those neighborhoods would be measured against the numbers from similar blocks where no modified mosquitoes were released			1
exhausting count : @entity16 's district spends roughly $ 1 million a year to suppress @entity31 mosquitoes , what they say is 10 to 15 percent of the agency 's budget the state 's agriculture department oversees the mosquito control district , and @entity64 said he would not expect any challenge from the state if the @entity10 signed off on the trial			1
the mosquito control district would n't need any local permit for the trial , either , but officials held a public meeting earlier this year and have posted information on the agency 's website			2
still , it could take years for the @entity10 to approve the trial			0
there has n't been a case of dengue fever in @entity16 since november 2010 , but two other cases were reported elsewhere in @entity3 this fall			1
the mosquito trial proposed for @entity16 would n't be the first release of genetically modified insects in the @entity13 in 2009 , the @entity13 @entity243 's @entity242 concluded that integrating genetically modified pink bollworms , bred by @entity35 to be sterile but more competitive in mating than regular bollworms , into the agency 's plant pest control program was ' the environmentally preferable alternative ' to combat the cotton pest			1
the program was discontinued , however , after officials found that the genetically modified insects were not as hardy as pink bollworms sterilized through irradiation , and that their use would cause farmers to lose their organic certification			1
@entity35 said the @entity243 's environmental assessment is one of several examples of proof that the trial 's risks and methods are being independently evaluated			0
the company has trials in @entity267 , the @entity268 and @entity269 , and it says it 's gotten positive reviews from the latter two governments			0
it also cites its published research in peer - reviewed journals			0
but @entity103 , the onetime dengue patient , wants @entity35 to continue testing the modified mosquitoes outside the @entity13 ' why the rush here ? ' the @entity16 man said			1
' we already have test cases in the world where we can watch what is happening and make the best studies , because would n't it be wonderful if we could find out how it can be fail - safe — which it is not right now			0
it 's an open @entity288			0

the non-biting male mosquitoes genetically modified would pass along a birth defect killing their progeny before reaching maturity
after a few generations officials say @entity16 's aedes aegypti population would die off reducing risk of dengue fever
@entity21 : modified genes will disappear after mosquitoes carrying it die making no permanent change to wild population
