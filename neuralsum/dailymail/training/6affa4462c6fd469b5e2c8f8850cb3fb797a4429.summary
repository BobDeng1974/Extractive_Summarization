former congresswoman @entity1 ' astronaut husband @entity0 and his identical twin brother have been selected to take part in an experiment which will study the impacts of space life on the body			1
@entity0 flew on four space shuttle missions before retiring in october 2011 to spend more time with his wife , ms @entity1 , after she was shot while meeting with constituents earlier that year			1
his identical brother @entity12 continues to be an active astronaut and is set to live on the @entity14 for a year starting in spring 2015			1
one of these things is not like the other : @entity0 ( right ) and his identical twin brother @entity12 ( left ) will take part in a study on how space life impacts the body the experiment : @entity23 will live on the @entity14 for a year while his brother will stay on earth			1
both will undergo the same periodic medical tests , one brother in space and the other on earth during that year , both brothers will help researchers study how the human body reacts to space life , by undergoing periodic medical examinations			1
@entity0 and @entity23 are good candidates for this type of research because they share practically the same dna			2
any differences between them therefore can be attributed to their environmental differences			0
' it offers an opportunity for an extra control to see if that can help us better understand this long - duration spaceflight process , ' @entity14 program scientist @entity44 told @entity50			2
but other scientists are doubtful the experiment will yield any usable results since only one set of twins will be studied			0
famous couple : @entity0 is the husband of former @entity57 congresswoman @entity1 , who was shot in 2011 while meeting with constituents ' this strikes me as a bit silly , ' said @entity62 of @entity63 , who founded the @entity65 @entity64			1
' you can compare the same person before and after [ spaceflight ] better than you can compare the person and their twin			0
if they 'd taken both of them on the mission , the could have explored how similarly they behave			0
' @entity76 admits that not all of the aspects of the experiment are ideal - since the @entity0 brothers wo n't be able to keep the same diet , carbon dioxide levels and sleep schedule			1
' obviously the sample groups have to have a certain number to be statically significant , so some of the science we 're going is more anectodal , ' @entity23 said			0
' but you can learn something and maybe learn about certain phenomena that you would then decide to investigate further			0
' the @entity0 brothers were born in @entity92 , @entity93 and went on to be captains and test pilots in the @entity96 before eventually joining @entity76 in 1996			2
becoming an astronaut is an extremely difficult thing to do , and the fact that both of them made the cut shows just how important genetics can be			0
according to @entity76 , the idea for the experiment comes from the @entity0 brothers themselves			2
survivor : @entity0 retired from @entity76 in october 2011 , following his wife 's injury			1
above , ms @entity1 on her last day in the @entity109 despite having so much physically in common , the brothers say they are quite different people personality-wise			0
' i 'm the smarter of the two and the better - looking , with the more charming personality , ' @entity12 recently joked			0
but in reality ' we 're two individuals who were born on the same day from the same egg , but other than that we are two different people			0
' the overarching goal of @entity23 's mission on the @entity14 is to study how the body reacts to long term space exposure			2
the 2015 mission will be the first time astronauts have spent an entire year on the @entity14 @entity23 will be joined on the @entity14 by @entity125 cosmonaut @entity124			1

both @entity0 and @entity23 joined @entity76 in 1996
@entity0 retired in october 2011 to spend more time with his wife after she was shot meeting with constituents that year
for the upcoming experiment , @entity0 will stay on earth while @entity12 will live on the @entity14 for year , from spring 2015 to spring 2016
researchers will study how their bodies react in two different environments
