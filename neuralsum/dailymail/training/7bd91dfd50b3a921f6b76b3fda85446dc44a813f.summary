@entity0 yesterday promised to increase the education budget every year – and echoed @entity3 ’s landmark 1997 election pledge to keep primary class sizes to a maximum of 30			1
mr @entity0 told an audience at his old secondary school that if he wins office in may , spending on education will benefit from a ‘ real terms ’ increase every year of the next @entity12			2
he accused @entity14 of planning to inflict ‘ big cuts in spending ’ which would ‘ short change our children ’s future ’ if he is elected for a second term			1
labour leader @entity0 promised to create thousands of new school places in @entity22 to cap class sizes for five , six and seven year olds but the @entity0 ’s promises were already unravelling last night as the @entity27 think - tank suggested that the @entity29 and @entity30 plans came to virtually the same amount of money , with the @entity30 potentially spending even more			1
mr @entity0 announced he would put £ 180million a year into capping class sizes at 30 pupils for five to seven year - olds			1
mr @entity3 , in his five - point pledge card for the 1997 election , had promised to cap class sizes at 30 , and laws to ban classes bigger than this were enacted in 2001			1
but by 2006 it emerged that nearly 30,000 pupils in 910 infant classes were being taught in groups larger than the legal limit , although @entity29 claimed at the time that the number of pupils taught in oversized groups had fallen by 477,000 between 1997 and 2006			1
mr @entity0 has blamed the @entity49 for allowing the number of young primary school pupils in classes of more than 30 to treble from 31,265 to 93,345 in four years			2
exceptions are only meant to be permitted in special circumstances such as to allow twins to be in the same class , or @entity58 children to get a place at their local school			0
mr @entity0 said that to take account of these exceptions , @entity29 would ban class sizes of more than 30 for any longer than 12 months			0
he said the 30 - pupil cap would be delivered by halting the creation of new free schools in areas where there are already state schools for children to attend			2
the @entity29 leader , speaking at @entity70 in @entity71 , said education ‘ is the passport to success in life ’ , adding : ‘ the next @entity29 government will protect the overall education budget			1
rising budgets , protected in real terms , every year			0
’ the move is part of @entity29 's plan for education in @entity22 , including the appointment of new local ' directors of standards ' to drive up schools ' performance mr @entity0 set our his education plans in a speech at his old school , @entity70 , in @entity71 he won praise from teachers ’ unions , but the @entity30 claimed that their spending plans , outlined by mr @entity14 last week , would actually involve spending more over the next five years			1
the prime minister said he would keep the amount of funding per pupil – around £ 4,200 a year in primary school and £ 5,300 for secondary pupils – the same for the period			0
this amounts to a real - terms cut per pupil , because it takes no account of rising inflation			0
but the schools budget will go up because the number of schoolchildren aged between five and 15 will rise by 7 per cent in the next five years			0
the @entity30 say this means they will spend £ 204.62billion on schools in the next @entity12 , while @entity29 would spend slightly less at £ 204.03billion			2
a spokesman for the @entity27 said the policies ‘ present different risks			0
if inflation is higher than expected then a cash freeze per pupil could be less generous			0
if the number of pupils increases by much more than expected , then it would be the other way around ’			0
the @entity27 said the @entity126 have only promised to protect schools at age five to 16 , not early years or sixth form , giving @entity29 flexibility to spend more in these areas .			2

@entity0 leader uses speech at his old school in @entity136 to echo @entity3 ’s landmark 1997 election pledge
classes would be limited to 30 pupils for five , six and seven year olds
scheme paid for by *scrapping* free schools in areas with *surplus* places
but under the last @entity29 government it emerged in 2006 that nearly 30,000 pupils were being taught in groups larger than the legal limit
accused @entity14 of planning to inflict ‘ big cuts in spending ’
but @entity27 think - tank suggested the @entity30 might potentially plan to spend even more
