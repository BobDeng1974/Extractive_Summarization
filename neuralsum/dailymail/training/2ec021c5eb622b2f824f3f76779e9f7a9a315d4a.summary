by @entity0 published : 23:13 est , 3 september 2013 updated : 02:38 est , 4 september 2013 middle - class parents who shout at their teenage children are increasing their risk of depression and troubled behaviour			1
even if parents enjoy a close relationship with their son and daughter , harsh verbal discipline was found have a dramatic impact on their teens emotional development , a study found			1
this form of discipline can vary from yelling and shouting at a child , to swearing and using words to humiliate them			0
damaging : a study found that parents tend to move from physical discipline to verbal as their children become teenagers ( file picture ) scientists looked at 976 two - parent families in the @entity31 , the majority of which were middle - class			1
they found that many shifted from physical to verbal discipline as their children entered adolescence			1
they also discovered that more severe forms of harsh verbal discipline were commonplace , and directed at teens in nearly half of households			2
the researchers found if parents use such punishment when their child is 13 , the teen is more likely to have behavioural or emotional problems later on			0
these youngsters tended to suffer more depressive symptoms between ages 13 and 14 than children who were not disciplined in this manner , while they were also more likely to have conduct problems such as misbehaving at school , lying , stealing , or fighting			0
effect : children whose parents shout at them are more likely to suffer symptoms of depression according to the study ‘ this is one of the first studies to indicate that parents ’ harsh verbal discipline is damaging to the developing adolescent , ’ said lead researcher dr @entity59 , assistant professor of psychology in education at the @entity62			1
‘ the notion that harsh discipline is without consequence , once there is a strong parent - child bond - that the adolescent will understand that ‘ they ’re doing this because they love me ’ - is misguided because parents ’ warmth did n’t lessen the effects of harsh verbal discipline			1
‘ indeed , harsh verbal discipline appears to be detrimental in all circumstances			2
’ the study , published in the journal @entity81 , found that not only does harsh verbal discipline appear to be ineffective at addressing behaviour issues , it may actually add to the problem			2
even if the parents were close to their child , this form of discipline still caused emotional damage			0
the report concluded : ‘ maternal and paternal warmth did not moderate the longitudinal associations between mothers ’ and fathers ’ use of harsh verbal discipline and adolescent conduct problems and depressive symptoms			2
’ the researchers suggested parents ’ hostility could actually lead to an increase in the risk of delinquency , by lowering inhibition and fostering anger , irritability , and belligerence in adolescents			0
during the experiment , teens and their parents completed surveys over a two - year period on topics related to their mental health , child rearing practices , and the quality of the parent - child relationship			0
approximately 90 per cent of @entity31 parents admit one or more instances of harsh verbal discipline towards their children			1
dr @entity59 suggests parents who want to discipline their teenage children would benefit by talking with them about their concerns and the consequences of the behaviour			0
he said the findings could influence future parenting programmes and encourage alternative methods of punishment to shouts and insults .			0
