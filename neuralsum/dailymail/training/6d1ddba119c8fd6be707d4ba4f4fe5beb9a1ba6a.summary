@entity1 students can breathe a little bit easier today knowing they are no longer required to reveal intimate details of their sex life to members of the school 's administration			1
the university , in @entity1 , @entity9 , had sent out a survey as part of a mandatory , one - hour long @entity13 training course that was to be completed by students , faculty , and staff , and asked how many sexual partners an individual had been with over the past three months			1
making matters worse , everyone who took the survey was required to sign in using their full name , email address and student @entity25			2
uproar : many at @entity1 ( above ) objected to a mandatory survey that required students to reveal how many sexual partners they had been with after much uproar among members of the student body , @entity1 has now decided to suspend the program			1
' it ’s not that i have an issue with being trained on @entity13 , ' one @entity1 student told @entity38			2
' i have an issue with the personal questions that are asked , and the fact that i ’m told it ’s anonymous , but it ’s clearly linked to my name , and it ’s obviously through a third party so not only is my information that i ’m going to be filling out — incredibly personal information regarding my sex life that i have issues with speaking about — it ’s not only going to the university , it ’s going to a third party company that i do n’t know			0
' that third party is @entity53 , a creator of online training programs dealing with sexual assault and substance abuse prevention			0
no privacy : the mandatory survey , which also asked how many times an individual had had sex over the past three months , required everyone to sign in using their full name , which many felt was a violation of privacy in addition to asking the number of sexual partners a person had been with , the survey also asked how many times an individual had sex over the past three months and how often they drank and did drugs			1
' does the university need to know if i had oral or normal sex in the last three months after i ’ve been drinking alcohol or using drugs recreationally or if i used a condom during ? ' asked senior @entity83			0
the university announced its plan to suspend the survey in an email sent last night			0
' required @entity13 online training has been suspended pending elimination of certain questions that were associated with a training module provided by a third - party vendor , ' it read			1
' @entity1 will eliminate these questions			2
we apologize for any concern and inconvenience this has caused			0
' there is no word yet when , or if , this training will resume .			0

@entity1 required students , faculty and staff to fill out a survey as part of a mandatory @entity13 training course
the survey asked , among other things , how many sexual partners an individual had been with and how often they drank alcohol
many felt the survey violated their privacy as they were forced to sign in using their full name before they answered the questions
after a *public* uproar , @entity1 suspended the survey and course
