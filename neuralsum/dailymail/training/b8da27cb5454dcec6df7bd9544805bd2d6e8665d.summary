by @entity0 last updated at 3:00 pm on 4th october 2011 @entity4 presidential candidate @entity3 's @entity2 bid has been thrown into doubt after a staff exodus , including her pollster and senior adviser , has led to questions about her campaign finances			1
pollster @entity11 plans to leave the campaign after upcoming debates in @entity14 and @entity15 , and senior adviser @entity16 is returning to the @entity19 congresswoman 's office where he served as chief of staff			1
the latest staff changes follow four previous resignations from mrs @entity3 's campaign team			1
she is now trailing in seventh place in a new opinion poll of public support for @entity4 presidential candidates			1
fall in support : @entity19 congresswoman @entity3 , pictured campaigning in @entity30 last week , has dropped to seventh place in a new poll of @entity4 presidential candidates maybe even more than the @entity4 , president @entity33 is looking forward to the @entity34 picking a candidate to challenge him			1
for now and months to come , mr @entity33 is an incumbent with no specific rival , a campaigner against various forces but not one in particular			0
he is running against a staggering economy			0
and himself - that history - making version of mr @entity33 that many voters remember from 2008			2
the longer it takes for @entity4 to rally around a nominee , the more the election remains a referendum on mr @entity33 and jobs			1
that 's not what the @entity2 and his campaign eagerly want - a clear choice between the president and another candidate who holds starkly different views about how to improve the economy			1
with polls showing his approval rating in the low 40s , mr @entity33 even contended yesterday that he 's the underdog			0
' i do n't mind - i 'm used to being an underdog , ' the president said in an interview with @entity65			2
with no control over when he gets an opponent , mr @entity33 is now waging what amounts to a proxy campaign against the eventual @entity4 nominee			1
every time he presents his jobs bill as a choice between helping the middle - class or protecting the ultra-rich , every time he tells @entity76 donors that his opponents ' approach to governing ' will fundamentally cripple @entity79 ' , he is previewing a campaign argument that he will apply against whoever his opponent is			1
@entity4 insiders say their party 's battle could extend into may - meaning mr @entity33 would not have a specific challenger for more than seven months			1
@entity87 , a @entity3 spokeswoman , said : ' given the changing caucus and primary schedule , we will not be utilising full - time polling consultants and will concentrate heavily on retail politics in @entity93			2
' @entity11 will work on several projects with us this month , then we shift focus to @entity93 and he will shift to other projects not associated with the campaign			2
' mr @entity16 's return to @entity19 follows a move to @entity93 last summer to build support before the state 's lead - off 2012 caucuses			2
the moves signal an effort to preserve money three months ahead of the first @entity4 nominating contests			1
mrs @entity3 began july with about $ 3.6million ( Â£ 2.3million ) , most of which had been transferred from her congressional campaign account			2
she has struggled to match her vast reach among small - dollar givers with cheques near the $ 2,500 maximum donation			0
an update on her campaign 's financial health is due by october 15			0
in other staff changes , deputy press secretary @entity118 transferred back to the congressional office after only a couple months with the campaign			0
so has mrs @entity3 's scheduler , @entity122			0
in a statement released last night , ms @entity87 said the moves were part of a long - standing strategy to ' shift people and resources as needed '			0
she said : ' we are adding staff in @entity93 , @entity14 and @entity132 to meet the demands of the changing caucus and primary schedule			0
' with @entity40 back in session , we have shifted some employees back to the congressional office to meet the demands there			0
' only last month , mrs @entity3 's campaign manager @entity141 and his deputy stepped down			0
mr @entity141 cited health reasons and deputy @entity144 attributed his departure to differences over the campaign 's direction			0
their exit came within weeks of the candidate 's @entity34 straw poll victory			1
after a strong start , numerous gaffes that earned her comparisons with that other hard - right conservative , @entity153 , mrs @entity3 's standing in the race is starting to suffer			2
she now stands as the seventh most popular @entity4 candidate			1
a fall in support was first noticeable when @entity164 governor @entity163 announced his candidacy			0
she fell further in opinion polls after suggesting an unproven link between vaccines and mental retardation while trying to criticise governor @entity163 's executive order requiring young girls to get immunised for the human papillomavirus , a sexually spread virus that can cause cervical cancer			0
former @entity177 governor @entity176 now leads the @entity4 race for the @entity2 with 25 per cent support for a consecutive month , according to a @entity181 / @entity65 poll of the 2012 @entity34 presidential candidates			1
frontrunner : massachusetts governor @entity176 speaks during a campaign stop at the @entity186 - @entity185 in @entity187 , @entity14 , last night @entity4 presidential candidates ( from left to right ) : mr @entity176 , mrs @entity3 , businessman @entity189 and former @entity79 ambassador to @entity193 @entity192 line - up in @entity194 last month a favourite among @entity197 supporters and evangelical voters , mrs @entity3 is now betting her campaign on @entity93			1
she hopes a win there would propel her back into contention with national poll leaders @entity163 and @entity176 , the former @entity177 governor			1
she spent parts of yesterday in @entity93 and will remain in the state today			0
mrs @entity3 is midway through her third term in the @entity2			2
she suspended her congressional campaign efforts when she announced for president but has n't explicitly ruled out a re-election bid			0
mrs @entity3 's propensity for gaffes has earned her comparisons with fellow conservative @entity4 @entity153 ( pictured ) , who has yet to enter the presidential race she would have until next june to decide , although many party insiders are doubtful that mrs @entity3 will try to reclaim her seat			1
@entity164 governor @entity163 's popularity has fallen - he is now joint second alongside businessman @entity189 now ties with 16 per cent			0
congressman @entity219 is fourth with 11 per cent , while mrs @entity3 trails at seventh where she ties with former house speaker @entity221 .			0

gaffe - prone congresswoman falls to seventh in poll of @entity34 candidates
pollster and senior adviser are the latest campaign figures to quit
@entity176 now leads the @entity4 race for the @entity2
