hundreds more viewers have complained about the second episode of the @entity3 's period drama @entity4 - despite the corporation pledging to fix the ' mumbling ' dialogue			1
the @entity3 received 546 complaints over monday night 's opening episode , with viewers saying they had to switch on subtitles or turn the volume to maximum to hear what was being said			1
but despite promises that the problem would be fixed , last night 's second episode drew 252 complaints so far - bringing the total to at least 798			1
' the tv adaptation of @entity24 's classic gothic novel , starring @entity44 actress @entity43 , initially pulled in 6.1million viewers but lost 1.6million on that figure last night			1
set in 1821 against the windswept @entity26 moors , the three - part drama was directed by @entity50 's @entity49 and follows @entity51 , who is forced to live with her aunt and domineering uncle after the death of her mother			1
the final episode will be aired at 9pm tonight			2
@entity57 , who wrote the screenplay , suggested a technical fault was to blame and not the way that the cast delivered the lines			0
complaints : viewers claimed they struggled to hear the first episode of @entity3 period drama @entity4 when it aired on monday evening blunder : comedian @entity68 joked about the inaudible drama the number of complaints to the @entity3 about @entity4 has already surpassed all but one of the shows most complained about to @entity75 last year			1
although @entity75 - a separate body - receives fewer complaints than the @entity3 does , just one programme clocked in at more than 800			1
the full list was : 1			0
@entity83 : @entity84 : 4925			0
celebrity big brother : 4386			0
@entity87 's @entity86 : 4227			2
@entity90 : 225 @entity91 asked the @entity3 for a similar list of its own complaints but a spokesman said one was not available			1
' no surprises here , ' she wrote			0
' i 'm told there was a major sound problem for tonight 's broadcast of @entity4 - not surprised you could n't hear it '			1
the total already makes the show one of the @entity3 's most complained - about in the last year			1
it is still beaten by the coverage of @entity108 's death , which received more than 1,300 complaints from viewers who said the airtime given to the former @entity113 leader was excessive			1
but it is far more than the 303 who complained about the quality of the commentary at the @entity118 as @entity87 snowboarder @entity119 won a bronze medal			2
the complaints come almost a year after @entity3 director - general @entity122 said the corporation could look at how to stop actors ' muttering ' in its tv dramas			1
' i do n't want to sound like a grumpy old man , but i also think muttering is something we could have a look at , ' he said			2
' actors muttering can be testing - you find you have missed a line ... you have to remember that you have an audience			2
' he said that the corporation was addressing the problem of background music which made it difficult for some viewers , particularly older ones , to hear what was being said			2
' faulty ' : only @entity144 actor @entity143 joined the chorus of complaint had enough : this viewer changed channels out of frustration only option : these two viewers found they could only follow the action by turning on the subtitles ' going deaf ' : another viewer struggled to make it through the flagship programme new role : the programme stars @entity44 actress @entity43 , [ @entity51 ] , who goes to live with her aunt after her mother passes away some audience members put monday 's problems down to the actors ’ thick @entity26 accents			1

viewer @entity181 tweeted : ‘ @entity4			0
even with a @entity26 accent			0
’ @entity57 , who wrote the screenplay for the adaptation , suggested that a technical fault , rather than the way that the cast delivered the lines , was to blame			0
she said : ‘ there was no problem on the version i saw , but tonight i could n’t hear			2
' the director and executives were on the phone to the @entity3 from the off yelling , “ why ca n’t we hear it ? ” too late i fear			2
none of the production team know what happened with the sound			0
’ director @entity49 previously told @entity203 : ‘ i think there was a sound issue ... i do n’t think anybody ’s actually got down to the bottom of why it happened			0
‘ my mum and dad live in the @entity211 and they did n’t have a problem			0
so i do n’t know if it was around the country or in some areas			0
‘ when we are dubbing , we always listen to it back on quite an old - fashioned ordinary telly			0
i suppose you ca n’t do everything for the vagaries of everybody ’s telly			0
’ in an apology , the @entity3 blamed ‘ issues with sound levels ’ , and said that although they could not be altered while the drama was on air , the dialogue was adjusted for last night ’s second episode and the third which airs tonight			1
