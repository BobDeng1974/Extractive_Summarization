@entity0 admits to a sense of disbelief at his sensational start to his loan spell at @entity5 which saw the former @entity7 midfielder voted as the club 's player of the month			1
@entity0 , who could start against @entity10 in the saturday lunchtime match with @entity12 returning late to @entity5 from international duty , scored a vital equaliser against his old club @entity15 , two more in the @entity16 against @entity17 and a further goal in the win at @entity20			1
@entity0 told @entity5 's official website : ' if somebody had said i would be voted player of the month by the fans in my first full month playing i would have had difficulty believing them			1
@entity0 has impressed for @entity5 since he joined the club on loan from @entity30 @entity0 scored a late equaliser against his old club @entity15 in september to salvage a point for @entity5 ' to beat @entity34 and @entity35 is really flattering and especially @entity34 , who has had a fantastic start to the season and is someone who does n't always get the plaudits he deserves - though i 've found that 's not the case with @entity5 fans who are very appreciative of him and what he brings to the team			1
' i think my goals probably edged it but @entity50 deserves a big shout out as well			0
' @entity0 , 36 , is likely to be given a hostile reception by @entity10 fans but will be looking to build on an impressive record against the @entity56 club			2
@entity0 ( second from right ) in training for @entity5 , is in line to start against @entity10 at the @entity60 on saturday he added : ' i 've done all right against @entity10 over the years and playing them was always a big game at @entity15			2
' i think they 'll be up and around the top six this season			0
they may go through a slight transitional period but i was very impressed with their manager when he was at @entity68 and if he can bring the same imprint on @entity10 , who arguably have more quality within their squad , they 'll do really well			0
' i 'm sure their aim is to get into the @entity76 , but it wo n't be easy and there is a lot of competition and there are a lot of teams all trying to achieve the same goal			0
