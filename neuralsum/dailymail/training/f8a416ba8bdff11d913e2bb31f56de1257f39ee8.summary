' she seemed to be pretty unresponsive , we were noticing a blueing of the lips , lack of oxygen			0
so her breathing had become quite shallow , ' said @entity28 , who found the dying the woman in august			0
he and @entity27 volunteer with a program in @entity31 , @entity32 which provides clean needles and other assistance to addicts			2
