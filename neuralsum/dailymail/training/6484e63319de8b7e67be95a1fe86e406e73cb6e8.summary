by @entity0 he 's the tv doctor famous for putting his body through some of the worst fad diets the industry has to offer , as well as creating a healthy regime of his own : the 5:2 diet			2
now @entity8 has turned his attention to doctors of a different kind - the incredible men and women who put their lives on the line to rescue animals caught up in war and natural disasters			1
among them are the crack team who descended on the @entity22 in the wake of @entity24 to come to the aid of some of the millions of creatures displaced by the disaster			1
in this moving account , dr @entity8 reveals why their work is so important and explains why we should n't forget about the plight of animals - even in the midst of a human tragedy			1
important work : @entity38 , the main vet , shows @entity8 how to hold a piglet ' i am used to investigating the internal workings of the human body , but last year i found myself in the @entity22 , where i spent my early childhood years			1
here i learnt how to bottle - feed a fully grown male water buffalo and helped build typhoon - proof houses for litters of charming little piglets , complete with removable roofs and warm , springy floors made of special bio-degradable compost			1
it was like being @entity52 on an eco-friendly gap year			0
when @entity24 hit this vast archipelago last year , winds of over 230 mph devastated the nation ’s 7,000 islands , killing over 6,000 people in a few hours and leaving over four million more homeless			1
but this human tragedy was only part of the story			1
as the farmers suffered , millions of domestic animals were killed in the storms or died later from injuries , starvation , exposure or disease			1
enter the @entity69 ( @entity69 ) , an organisation dedicated to promoting animal welfare across the globe			1
tragedy : when @entity24 hit the @entity22 on 8th november 2013 , it killed more than 6,000 people aid : the typhoon also killed six million animals but vets such as @entity78 are there for those who survived important : water buffaloes such as this one are a hugely important part of @entity22 life they have teams ready to come to the aid of animals caught up in natural catastrophes at four days ’ notice			1
@entity89 asked me to join them			0
i ’d done a series called @entity92 about doctors treating @entity95 troops in @entity96			0
i ’d never been involved in veterinary work before , and that was part of the attraction			1
i was curious to see what vets have to do in these situations , as opposed to what medics do			2
i ’d never thought about the scale of the problem			0
the figures were quite enormous , unimaginable in fact			0
over six million animals died as a result of that typhoon			1
some of the animals killed , maimed and at risk were pets , but far more were farm animals which provide the villagers with a vital source of income			1
in the @entity22 that mainly means pigs , chickens and the gentle , peaceful water buffalo			1
if you lose a pig that may mean losing your child ’s schooling for a year , not being able to pay for your daughter ’s wedding or to get essential hospital treatment			0
it ’s not that the farmers do n’t care about their animals			2
the pigs in particular are extremely intelligent creatures			2
they often seem to exhibit human - like emotions			0
they are extremely social , like to do things in groups and seem to look out for each other			0
after the typhoon , they were in big trouble			0
their pens were destroyed , and if they were n’t killed , they were exposed to the searing daytime heat and night - time chill with no protection			0
on one farm my team visited hundreds of pigs had died , so @entity155 , the owner , agreed to let the team use the place to create an experimental type of pig - house , designed to be typhoon - proof , with a detachable roof and a brilliant self - cleaning compost floor			1
watching this amazing , innovative construction take shape , was a bit like an episode of @entity166 for livestock			2
@entity169 - proof : the vets create a sturdy new pig home on a farm where most of the animals were killed relief : @entity8 with @entity155 , the owner of a pig farm which lost hundreds of animals to the typhoon the @entity69 ’s director of disaster management is an adventurous 39 - year - old @entity179 , @entity180 from @entity181 , but the team were from many countries			1
@entity184 , is head of operations , a thoughtful intellectual type with 30 years experience in the field			0
@entity38 ( ‘ @entity190 ’ ) , the main vet , has a strong sense of a calling			2
the day - to - day logistics was in the hands of @entity78 , a bright , and unusual young woman who had started out working as a wedding planner and then got involved with rock music			0
she needed those complementary skills to get things done			0
i really liked their blend of different characteristics			0
they have a huge appetite for the work , in fact they are quite addicted to the adrenalin rush of going in and sorting things out			2
they had been everywhere and done everything			0
and they were prepared to drop everything and go anywhere at any time			0
they must have very understanding partners at home			0
what ’s striking about @entity38 , this team ’s vet , is the empathy he has for large creatures			2
he was trying to teach the local vets more humane ways of handling them			2
he is a real dr @entity227 , demonstrating how you can calm a cow or water buffalo down and position it so that you can examine it			1
job well done : after completing their work in the @entity22 , the vets headed to @entity234 and a drought @entity190 showed me how to get a buffalo to drink medicine by serving it in a lager bottle gently pushed into its mouth at the side of its tongue			1
the beast then rolled it around like @entity247 in ‘ @entity248 ’ rolling his cigarette from side to side , until the medicine had gone down			0
other stand - out moments for me included watching the sperm being collected from a massive boar , enough to sire hundreds of piglets , and a disturbing visit to a farm where they raise fighting cocks			0
when they train them they put pads over their spurs , like boxers sparring , but when i saw the long , razor - sharp blades they use for real fights , i decided i had seen enough			0
in the end it became a hearts and minds campaign as the team devised sustainable , economic solutions to animal welfare problems and trained the locals in more effective ways of delivering life - saving treatment			0
you ’d imagine they might suffer from ‘ disaster fatigue ’ , but they ’re surprisingly fresh - faced and enthusiastic about it all , happy to get up at 5.00am and work until a meeting at 10.00pm at night			2
and when they had finished in the @entity22 , they had new , imminent disasters lined up to head off to next : a drought in @entity234 and a possible volcanic eruption in @entity292			1
vets in the @entity294 , presented by @entity8 , tonight on @entity89 at 9pm			1

*emergency* vets are *funded* by @entity69
vet teams go to the site of disasters to help injured and displaced animals
@entity8 travelled to @entity22 in aftermath of @entity24
six million animals died in the disaster and many more were injured
livestock particularly at risk , among them huge water buffalo and pigs
pigs are an important part of the rural economy in the @entity22
