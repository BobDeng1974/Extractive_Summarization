this was a painful , embarrassing lesson for @entity3 in how to play one - day cricket in an age where they have been left behind in the 50 - over game			1
one of the teams involved in saturday 's showpiece at the @entity10 have every chance of winning the @entity12 and it is n’t @entity3			2
@entity14 were always going to be hot favourites in this opening match of the premier one - day tournament in front of 84,336 but this was much worse than @entity3 could have imagined			1
do not be fooled by the late @entity3 runs once the tension had gone from the contest			2
this was an absolute demolition of @entity26 ’s side and their aspirations of springing a @entity29 surprise , as they lost by 111 runs			0
@entity3 failed to win their 2015 @entity12 opener as they failed to chase down @entity14 's score of 342 @entity14 's @entity34 is congratulated by his team - mates after taking the wicket of @entity26 @entity3 captain @entity26 looks dejected as he walks past @entity14 as they celebrate @entity37 made their highest ever one - day score against @entity3 , their murderous 342 for nine also being the most by any team against @entity3 in any of the @entity40 stretching back 40 years			1
then @entity3 made a pitiful attempt at making history by collapsing not against their nemesis @entity43 nor even the equally rapid @entity45 but a third @entity43 in the innocuous looking reserve all - rounder @entity34			1
@entity47 ’s hat - trick , gained far too late to make any difference to the outcome off the last three balls of the innings , and @entity55 's classy , unbeaten 98 after the game had gone merely papered over alarming cracks			2
it is no disgrace to lose to @entity14 in this @entity12			2
the hosts are a powerful , gifted one - day side playing a high - octane brand of cricket and it will take an extremely good team to stop them returning to this great ground for the final on march 29			1
@entity3 , in contrast , are a work in progress , having fallen way behind in a 50 - over format which has progressed dramatically in the last two years while they have regressed because of ridiculous schedules and their prioritising of test cricket			1
yet it is disgraceful to surrender so meekly , to capitulate to the least heralded member of the @entity76 attack so timidly with little of the heart and character that must be a bare minimum for any @entity3 side			2
@entity26 , pictured clipped a ball through to @entity14 's wicket keeper , failed to guide his side to victory @entity14 's @entity34 bowls during their @entity12 pool a match against @entity3 in @entity10 @entity14 's wicketkeeper @entity86 celebrates after catching out @entity3 's @entity87 @entity3 would surely have hoped to show more signs of improvement than this , to have justified the quiet optimism in their ranks that has led to some of us talking hopefully of them as possible semi-finalists			1
well , the flawed structure of this tournament means that this defeat does not really matter in that regard because all @entity3 will have to do to make the last eight at least is defeat @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103			0
but this will be a massive blow to their confidence and they will not be helped by the prospect of their second game being against another very strong one - day side and a good bet to win the cup themselves in co-hosts @entity113			1
the @entity113 warmed up by dismantling @entity114 in @entity115			0
@entity3 did not help themselves			0
to have any hope they had to take every half chance that came their way but as early as the fifth ball @entity120 had dropped @entity121 on nought and hope seeped out of @entity3			1
it was inevitable then that @entity125 would go on to score a match - defining hundred			0
it was not the only lapse by a long way			0
@entity131 got nowhere near a powerful catchable drive from @entity133 , @entity134 , brought in at the 11th hour for @entity135 , got nowhere near a skier from @entity137 and @entity87 could not hold on to a hard chance offered by @entity139 on 42			0
and to think that @entity3 ’s fielding had been excellent throughout a tri-series that actually provided encouragement that they were on the up			1
their collapse in the field , at least until @entity144 and @entity145 held difficult chances to give @entity47 the first two wickets of his hat - trick , was simply inexplicable			0
@entity3 's @entity47 embraces @entity151 after taking the wicket of @entity14 's @entity43 @entity14 's @entity121 walks past as @entity3 's team celebrates running him out during their match @entity14 , in contrast , were magnificent			1
they are without captain @entity156 and , more damagingly , @entity157 , but this is a squad brimming with one - day talent and ready to seize their moment in front of their home fans			1
if @entity125 provided the backbone to their innings with 135 they were also indebted to @entity139 for his late 66 off 40 balls at a time when @entity3 seemed to have clawed their way back towards sniffing a chance			1
twice , in fact , @entity3 were still in the match , firstly when @entity144 took two wickets in successive balls in the eighth over , and then when @entity125 and @entity137 fell without two overs of each other			0
but each time @entity14 powered away			0
let ’s clutch at some positive straws			0
@entity47 is getting back towards his full pace and finished with five for 71 while @entity144 is also nearing his best again			0
but the lack of a sixth bowler , exacerbated by the dropping of @entity135 , meant that @entity26 had nowhere to turn when his bowlers were suffering			0
the game was effectively over by the halfway mark , @entity3 ’s death bowling letting them down again with an almost total mystifying lack of yorkers , but @entity3 needed to at least make a decent fist of their reply			0
instead they collapsed against a man who would not even have been playing had @entity157 been fit			0
@entity3 bowler @entity144 appeals for a wicket during their cricket world cup pool a match @entity14 captain @entity137 falls after he played a hook shot during their cricket world cup pool a match once the rapid @entity45 had forced @entity131 into an injudicious demise it was over to @entity34 , no more than a medium - pacer compared to his team - mates , to cut swathes through the @entity3 batting line - up with ridiculous ease			1
only @entity87 could consider himself unlucky , falling victim to a quite superb diving catch from @entity205 that epitomised @entity14 ’s excellence and mastery on the day			1
most worryingly for @entity3 , captain @entity26 suffered his fourth duck in five innings and looks painfully out of form			2
when @entity87 went @entity3 were 92 for six and facing complete humiliation but at least @entity55 , who did himself a power of good with an innings of proper industry and innovation , and @entity218 showed some fight in a stand of 92 that delayed the inevitable			2
the innings ended in some farce when @entity55 successfully reviewed an lbw decision only for the umpires to give @entity151 run out as the pair crossed after the initial decision			0
surely the ball should have been dead once the umpire 's finger was raised ? it only mattered to @entity55 's attempts to score his first one - day international hundred			1
@entity34 , barely believably , ended with five for 33 on a highly satisfying day for the hosts and @entity3 , meanwhile , have much to contemplate before friday ’s game in @entity235 after one of their heaviest defeats in any @entity12 match			2
@entity45 runs past the crowd with his finger up high after catching out @entity3 's @entity241			0

@entity14 defeated rivals @entity3 in front of 84,336 spectators
@entity121 provided the backbone to their innings with 135
@entity14 made their highest ever one - day score against @entity3
