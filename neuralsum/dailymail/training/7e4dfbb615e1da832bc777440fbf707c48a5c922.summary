@entity11 , 61 , was reunited in @entity12 on tuesday with @entity13 , an old flame who he has not seen in almost 30 years and hopes spending time with her might trigger an avalanche of lost memories			1
' i just want to be able to live a normal life and hopefully get my memory back , ' @entity11 said tuesday according to @entity22			1
reunion : @entity13 speaks to @entity7 cameras after her emotional reunion with @entity11 at @entity26 on tuesday hope : @entity11 hopes his reunion with @entity28 in @entity12 will allow his memories to come back like @entity30 : after being apart since 1984 - @entity11 and @entity28 begin to catch up on old times outside @entity33 airport on tuesday feeling like a stranger in his country because he did n't speak @entity37 , @entity11 's reunion with @entity28 came after she saw his story online and recognized his face			1
' i think it 's the best solution for @entity11 , because he ca n't speak @entity37 , ' said @entity13 , who dated @entity11 while he worked as a designer in @entity8 in the early 1980s before the split in 1984			1
' to recover fully , i think he needs to come where he 's safe and understands what 's happening around him			0
' @entity28 has kindly arranged a place for @entity11 and she sees him daily in an attempt to help him recover a lifetime of memories			2
amnesia : @entity11 awoke to find he had no memory of his past life to date , could not recognize his own reflection and believed he was @entity7 ' @entity11 asked me , ' why are you doing this for me ? ' because i know @entity11 would have done the same thing for me			1
if he had found me in the papers			0
this is a very nice man with a very big heart , ' @entity13 said to @entity22			0
diagnosed with dissociative amnesia , a rare psychiatric condition usually triggered by a traumatic event , @entity11 woke dazed and confused on february 28th in hospital earlier this year , unable to recognize his own face in the mirror			1
speaking through an interpreter , he said his name was @entity70 , but that clashed with the social security card , passport and veteran 's medical card he was carrying - all which identified him as @entity78			0
medical professionals appealed for help in solving the mystery of @entity85 , the only clues they had to his former life were a duffel bag , five tennis rackets , two cellphones , little cash , some old photographs and his identification			0
former life ; @entity11 served in the @entity2 from 1971 to 1973 ( left ) and was carrying old photographs on him when he was discovered in a @entity95 motel room in february baffling : @entity11 is pictured here with two women - one who is believed to be his wife and a little boy thought to be his son no recollection : this is one of the photographs which have failed to jog the memory of @entity11 from his amnesia but as @entity11 's mysterious and enigmatic story carried round the world , those who knew him came forward to offer up small pieces of his forgotten life			1
his sister said that she had n't talked to him in ten years and that she could n't even get in touch with him in 2012 when their mother had died			0
' he ’s always been just a wanderer			0
then he ’d come back when he needed some money or something from somebody			0
then he ’d take off again , ' she said to the @entity120 staff at @entity122 in @entity95 discovered through their own work that @entity11 was a 3d graphic designer who taught @entity37 in @entity125 for 10 years and then in @entity126 for four			1
diving : @entity127 submitted these photos , saying she knew @entity11 in the 1980s			2
@entity11 , 61 , is pictured in the diving helmet boat - trip : @entity11 served in the @entity2 in the 70s and here he is pictured in 1982 in @entity8 in a picture taken by @entity28 @entity133 : with no memories returning in the six months since he awoke in @entity95 with total amnesia , @entity11 is hoping that his @entity8 trip will restore them - here he is in the early 1980s a fellow @entity37 language teacher in @entity139 , @entity126 contacted the center and offered a tantalizing glimpse into @entity11 's life before his catastrophic memory loss			1
@entity144 said he knew @entity78 when he worked at the the @entity145 , while @entity11 worked at the @entity147 @entity37 school			1
@entity144 said that @entity11 was a very good tennis player , spoke flawless @entity37 and was healthy			1
' there was no inkling of any deep personal issues			0
he never talked about money			0
he did n't talk much about his past life , ' @entity144 told @entity153 ' and then there was this one friday night where i get a phone call			1
' @entity11 was in trouble			2
all @entity159 could make out over the phone was his friend whispering for help			0
relief : @entity11 uses exercise as the only way to concentrate his mind and not think about his memory loss @entity168 did all it could to identify relatives of @entity11 - but now he has moved onto @entity12 , @entity8 so he showed up at @entity11 's home with his wife and two other friends and found that the man they knew was living in a ' hovel ' - a single - room basement apartment that had no bathroom			1
@entity11 was inside and unconscious with a glass of vodka and half a vial of animal tranquilizers next to him			2
skeptical : @entity144 knew @entity11 back in @entity126 , and helped the man get back to the @entity183 before his visa expired			2
he 's not sure if the amnesia is real he was rushed to the hospital and treated , eventually being released into his friend 's care			0
during his time at @entity144 ' house , @entity11 talked about his ex-wife in @entity125 , and how he had been ' cut off ' from their son			2
@entity11 admitted that he could n't go back to his job at the school and did n't know where to go next - his visa was set to expire			2
the @entity198 @entity37 school confirmed that @entity11 quit in january and that he had an ex-wife in @entity125			1
so @entity144 came up with an idea to send @entity11 to @entity95 , @entity4 to look for a job as a tennis instructor			1
he had contacts at a local @entity204 where @entity11 could try and get a job			2
@entity144 paid for @entity11 's one - way flight and gave his friend $ 400 to start a new life			1
@entity11 left @entity126 on february 24 , the last day of his visa , and that was the last time that @entity159 heard from his friend			2
his current persona of @entity211 , clashes with the social security card , passport and veteran 's medical card he was carrying in february and following mental and physical health exams doctors at @entity122 have theorized that his total memory loss was triggered by some kind of emotional or physical trauma - what exactly that was though , they admit to drawing a blank on			1
' he 's kind of a blank slate , ' said @entity225 , the social worker assigned to track down relatives and help piece his life back together			0
for @entity11 , the sheer frustration and confusion of the whole ordeal is maddening			0
former life : @entity11 worked as an @entity37 language teacher in @entity126 and @entity125 for almost 15 years ' when i look at the photos , i see my ex-wife and my son ... my mother and grandmother , but i do n't recognize them			1
i do n't know them , ' he said			0
' sometimes it makes me really sad and sometimes it just makes me furious about the whole situation			0
' for @entity11 , though , his daily life is a living hell			2
' walk in my shoes for one day , ' he said			0
' you 'll experience the nightmare of a lifetime			0
' however , despite the international attention @entity11 's story has garnered , some are suspicious and doubt he has lost his memory			2
@entity255 for one , does n't believe that @entity11 lost his memory			2
' i just think here is a guy that has no place to go , is desperate and is broke			0
if he does this , at least he has a bed and three meals a day , ' @entity144 said			0
' he 's reached the end of his line			0
but that 's just a personal perception			0
' the @entity7 - @entity183 community in @entity95 also finds aspects of ' @entity211 ' questionable			1
they 've been helping him adjust to his new reality at the @entity274 's @entity273			0
wife : this woman is believed to be an acquaintance in @entity125 - but she has not come forward to see @entity11 after five months of trying to dupe him into speaking @entity37 , he has n't slipped once said his social worker @entity225			1
one of @entity11 's friends at the @entity274 , @entity280 , does believe that @entity11 lived in @entity8 during the mid- 1980s , but he does n't speak with a regional accent which is strange			1
@entity280 says this could be because he learned the language later in life , or has n't used it much during his adult life			0
unable to remember how to speak @entity37 , @entity286 , @entity287 , or even work as a designer - the one thing that @entity11 still can do is to play tennis			1
he hopes to start work as a tennis instructor in @entity8 as soon as he is on his feet			1
' after death , this is probably the worst thing you could ever go through , ' he said .			0
