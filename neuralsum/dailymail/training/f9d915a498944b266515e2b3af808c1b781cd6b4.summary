by @entity0 and @entity1 all it takes is one burger with a fancy bun to remake a brand			0
after launching their new @entity7 last month , @entity6 has seen it 's stock prices increase 42 per cent , outperforming fast - food competitors @entity11 and @entity12 ( @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 )			1
when the pretzel burger launched on july 1 stock prices were hovering around $ 5.90 a share			1
based on 393 million shares outstanding , that valued the company at $ 2.3billion			0
yesterday closing prices were up to $ 7.80 making the company 's value a month later $ 3.1billion , according to @entity6 's vice president of investor relations @entity24			2
since the burger 's launch last month , @entity34 of @entity43 called the burger ' the best - selling new product introduction by that burger concept in at least a decade			1
' the last time @entity6 's stock was this hot was back in 2002 when they marketed a new line of high - end salads			1
while the burger is currently a limited - time only affair , if sales continue to rise it could become a permanent fixture on the menu			2
this could lead to the development of new menu items using the pretzel bun which could affect @entity6 's financial success ' for years to come , ' @entity34 told the @entity65			1
soaring sales : the burger 's launch has pushed the fast - food brand ahead of competitors like @entity70 's , @entity13 and @entity15 on the stock market @entity34 estimated in a report this week that @entity6 's same - store sales would be up 5.5 per cent by the third quarter of 2013			1
same - store sales are measurements of sales using sales figures from current stores , excluding data from new store openings and stores that have closed			2
the last time the brand saw such an increase was in 2011 , with a 5.1 per cent increase in sales over one quarter with the launch of it 's @entity90 ' n @entity92 burgers and in 2002 with a line of high - end salads which sparked sales increases of 5 per cent or higher for three quarters			1
@entity6 's same - store sales have risen the past two years , but 5.5 per cent is more than double last year 's 2.7 per cent sales increase			1
part of the burger 's success may be in the fact that the fancy bun appeals to millennials			0
younger customers : the new burger may be an attempt to attract millennial customers , a new trend among fast - food brands pretzel love songs : @entity6 's booked former @entity112 singer @entity111 to sing customer 's love - filled tweets for the new menu item at a store in @entity117 ceo @entity118 and other @entity6 's executives have noted that small adjustments like bread can have a big impact on how customers perceive the quality and healthfulness of a chain 's food - making them competitors for upscale fast - food chains like @entity131 or @entity132 which are modeled to appeal to new - age customers			1
and @entity6 is n't the only brand focusing on a younger generation of customers			2
long - term : if the burger becomes a permanent item on the menu , @entity34 predicts financial success for the brand ' for years to come ' fast - food chains like @entity70 's and @entity15 are implementing new menu items to appeal to a younger set			1
calories : @entity144 ( g ) : @entity145 ( g ) : @entity146 ( g ) : 1.5 @entity147 ( g ) : @entity148 ( g ) : @entity149 ( mg ) : @entity150 ( mg ) : @entity151 ( mg ) : @entity152 ( g ) : @entity153 ( g ) : @entity154 ( g ) : @entity155 ( g ) : @entity156 ( per cent of daily value ) : @entity158 ( per cent / @entity159 ) : @entity160 ( per cent / @entity159 ) : @entity161 ( per cent / @entity159 ) : 30 @entity70 's focus is on adding healthier items , like their new egg - white breakfast sandwich , in an attempt to appeal to calorie - counters between 18 and 32			1
@entity15 , which recently ditched their kids menu to be more ' edgy ' , is focusing more on trendier menu items like their new breakfast taco or the @entity171 locos tacos			0
the pretzel burger takes a bit from both of these approaches			0
the bun makes it look more upscale , but in reality it 's not that healthy			0
according to nutritional information on @entity6 's website , the burger comes it at 680 calories with a shocking 1,100 mg of sodium			2
but calorie counts do n't seem to matter too much with recent fast - food menu item launches like the @entity186 at @entity187 and the @entity189 @entity188			0
' this could be a very , very big deal , ' @entity190 , professor of hospitality at @entity192 's @entity191 , told @entity195			0
' i do n't know why , but there 's nothing else on the market quite like it			0
if it 's a hit , others are guaranteed to follow			0
' @entity187 is already planning a pretzel bun menu item of their own			0
on monday the coffee chain announced they would be launching a @entity205 sandwich .			0

the new @entity7 was launched at @entity6 in early july
since it 's launch the brand has seen stock shares outperform their competition of @entity70 's and @entity12
@entity35 analyst predicts a 5.5 per cent increase in sales in the third quarter - the most *significant* increase in two years
