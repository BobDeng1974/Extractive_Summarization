by @entity0 follow @ @ the_topspin @entity2 coach @entity1 has urged @entity3 to ‘ stay strong ’ as he tries to bat his way out of the worst drought of his 105 - @entity7 career			1
@entity3 ’s latest attempt to register an increasingly elusive 26th century will begin on thursday at @entity9 , where @entity2 take on @entity10 in the second @entity7 following the bore draw at @entity12			1
the @entity2 captain has now gone 25 innings – and 16 months – without reaching three figures , and made just five in his only innings on @entity18 ’s featherbed before being bowled round his legs and off his thigh pad by seamer @entity21			1
backing : @entity1 ( right ) is confident @entity3 will end his current test run drought that left @entity3 to issue a familiar refrain – in part aimed at @entity2 fans , in part aimed at himself – about the importance of getting his side off to a good start			1
‘ i ’ve got to believe the wheel will turn at some stage , ’ he said on sunday evening , almost as if the act of repeating the hope was more likely to make it come true			0
but there is no appetite among @entity42 cricket ’s upper echelon for regime change , and it was unsurprising to hear @entity1 ’s conviction that @entity3 would eventually come good			1
‘ it was an extraordinary dismissal , ’ he said			0
‘ you maybe get one of those in a career , two if you are unlucky			0
to get one when you desperately need a score is tough			0
i hope that ’s the end of it for him now and he gets a few breaks			0
‘ he has been through this situation before			0
that is what makes great test players : they can ride through it and come back strong			2
he will be very keen to put his mark on @entity9			0
he is a top - flight player			2
he has to stay strong			0
’ @entity62 dismissal : @entity3 is bowled by one that flicked off his thigh pad and on to the stumps as @entity1 pointed out , this is nothing new for @entity3			2
between march 2008 and february 2009 , he went 27 test innings without a hundred – but that sequence was leavened by 11 half - centuries , while the current drought has brought him only seven fifties and a modest top score of 72			1
distraught : @entity3 looks down after his first @entity7 dismissal at @entity12 then , in 2010 , @entity3 began the summer with 106 runs in eight innings against @entity78 and @entity79 , before securing a last - minute spot on the plane to @entity82 with a battling 110 against the @entity83 at @entity84			1
just as well : @entity3 ’s @entity85 would net him a memorable 766 runs			2
even during @entity10 ’s last visit here , three years ago , @entity3 took a while to warm up			1
the first two tests at @entity12 and @entity91 ’s produced scores of 12 , one , two and five			2
then came a monumental 294 at @entity93			0
in other words , all is not lost			0
his batting , of course , is only the half of it			0
@entity2 have not won any of their last nine tests , and @entity3 ’s worth as a tactician remains in the balance after the horror show at @entity105 , where @entity107 captain @entity106 was all but ushered towards 160 by some negative field placings			1
@entity1 , though , insisted he had seen signs of progress			0
‘ what i have been impressed with @entity3 is that , during a really tough time for him , he has grown rapidly as a captain and person around the team			1
‘ i thought his captaincy in @entity18 was exceptional in a tough game			2
there was no time off , there was no right or wrong in the field – we saw that with the last - wicket partnerships			0
’ whether conditions at @entity9 will assist @entity3 ’s attempts to end @entity2 ’s winless spell is another matter			1
the test there against @entity107 last month yielded almost 1,500 runs , and one of groundsman @entity133 ’s famous flat ones is expected again this week			1
nothing new : @entity3 has struggled before , notably against @entity79 in 2010 asked whether he had spoken to groundsman at the venues for the remaining four tests in this series – lord ’s , the @entity144 , @entity145 and the @entity84 – in the hope of avoiding a repetition of the @entity12 fiasco , @entity1 replied : ‘ we do it all the time			1
preparing pitches is not an exact science , people know what we want , but whether we get that or not ... ‘ there is a theme at the moment – and it is not one we particularly like			0
if it is a wicket with bounce in it , we back ourselves			0
’ the worry , though , has to be that @entity2 ’s prize seamers will eventually crack under the strain			2
@entity159 and @entity160 bowled 113 overs between them in @entity18			0
if @entity10 win the toss on thursday and bat first , @entity2 ’s new - ball attack may begin to wonder whether this five - match series will ever end			1
light relief : @entity3 had more success with the ball at @entity12 , taking the wicket of @entity171 @entity172 and @entity173 reach record heights			1

@entity3 has gone 25 innings without a test hundred
@entity2 captain scored just five against @entity10 at @entity12
nobody in higher echelons of @entity42 cricket wants @entity3 out
@entity2 have not won for nine test matches
@entity3 *'s* captaincy - especially in *defeat* by @entity107 - has been *criticised*
