scientists are learning how children 's brains change as they develop intellectual abilities like reading and math - by letting them watch @entity5			1
the team at the @entity7 are using brain scans to study watching to children 's tv show to see how neural pathways change as we develop			1
they say it could pave the way for new understanding of brain development , and even lead to new therapies for learning disabilities			0
what your brain looks like on @entity23 : one one the team 's neural maps			1
the @entity27 scan on the left represents correlations in neural activity between children and adults , in the middle between children and other children , and on the right between adults and other adults			1
unlike x-rays , @entity41 scans , and other types of brain imaging , @entity27 involves no risks , injections , surgery , or exposure to radiation			2
using magnetic fields , the scans virtually segment the brain into a three - dimensional grid of about 40,000 pixels , known as voxels , and measure the neural signal intensity in each of those tiny sectors			1
for example , researchers have compared scans of adults watching an entertaining movie to see if neural responses are similar across different individuals			1
' but this is the first study to use the method as a tool for understanding development , ' said lead author @entity69 , a cognitive scientist at the @entity7			0
eventually , that understanding may help pinpoint the cause when a child experiences difficulties mastering school work			0
' psychologists have behavioral tests for trying to get the bottom of learning impairments , but these new imaging studies provide a totally independent source of information about children 's learning based on what 's happening in the brain , ' says @entity69			2
for the investigation , 27 children between the ages of 4 and 11 , and 20 adults watched the same 20 - minute @entity5 video			1
like the regular program , the recording featured a variety of short clips focused on numbers , words , shapes , and other subjects			0
the researchers analysed brains scans of both children and adults as they watched @entity5 characters , such as @entity105 , shown here , to see how their brains developed as they learnt the study produced 609 scans of each participant , one every two seconds , as they watched @entity23 , the count , @entity111 and other stars of the educational series			1
using statistical algorithms , the researchers then created ' neural maps ' of the thought processes for the children and the adults and compared the groups			1
the children then took standardized iq tests for math and verbal ability			0
children whose neural maps more closely resembled the neural maps of adults scored higher on standardized math and verbal tests			1
in other words , the brain 's neural structure , like other parts of the body , develops along predictable pathways as we mature , the team said			2
the study also confirmed where in the brain these developing abilities are located			0
for verbal tasks , adult - like neural patterns in the @entity145 area , which is involved in speech and language , predicted higher verbal test scores in children			2
puppeteer @entity151 , who died last year , is shown with ' @entity5 ' character count von count			0
researchers are using the show to study how we learn for math , better scores were linked to more mature patterns in the intraparietal sulcus ( @entity160 ) , a region of the brain known to be involved in the processing of numbers			2
although the study does not advocate tv watching , it does show that ' neural patterns during an everyday activity like watching television are related to a person 's intellectual maturity , ' says @entity69			0
' it 's not the case that if you put a child in front of an educational tv program that nothing is happening â€“ that the brain just sort of zones out			0
instead , what we see is that the patterns of neural activity that children are showing are meaningful and related to their intellectual abilities			0

team showed children and adults 20 minute long @entity5 videos while giving them brain scans
researchers were able to build ' neural maps ' of changes to see how children learn
