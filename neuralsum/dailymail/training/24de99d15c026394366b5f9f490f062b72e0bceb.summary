human traffickers are forcing illegal immigrant children to cut off the ears and fingers of other kids traveling into the @entity7 in order to extort money from their families , a @entity1 senator claimed on monday			1
lashing out at president @entity12 for a 2012 policy shift that he said encourages @entity15 parents to send their children northward , sen. @entity11 said the children are being placed in ' unspeakable ' peril when the traffickers , known as ' coyotes , ' take over			1
' we just heard stories of little boys and little girls , forced by these drug dealers to cut off the fingers or cut off the ears of other little boys and little girls , in order to extort money from their families , ' @entity11 said after he toured the temporary holding facility for ' unaccompanied alien children ' at @entity34 along with @entity1 attorney general @entity35 and rep. @entity36			1
' and these children are told , " if you do n't cut off the fingers or ears of another child , you 'll be shot "			1
' @entity11 was relating accounts he heard from officials at the @entity34 facility in @entity45 , according to a spokesperson in his office			2
these are hardened , cold criminals			0
these are transnational , global criminal cartels			0
and they are vicious , violent murderers			0
' ' these children are being subjected to physical abuse , to sexual abuse			0
some of them are losing their lives			0
' ' when the @entity73 prevents the @entity74 from following the law and enforcing our immigration laws , ' @entity11 declared , ' when the @entity73 announces to the world , " @entity81 for those who have broken the law , " the consequence is that people respond to that			2
' ' and the way they 've responded to that is handing over their children to drug dealers and vicious cartels			1
' @entity35 , who is running to succeed @entity50 @entity91 as governor of @entity1 , confirmed the accounts they heard and agreed that the @entity95 deserves the blame			1
' we are dealing with a human - made crisis			0
the challenges these children are going through are unprecedented , ' he said , ' and it is unacceptable to have children housed in facilities like this			0
' ' equally unacceptable , though , is to have a president promoting policies that entice children to navigate more than 1,000 miles away from home , going through the most treacherous conditions , facing things like human trafficking and sexual assault			2
' ' we were told of remarkable stories , stories about children having their ears cut off , of having fingers cut off in the pathway , on the way here			1
a story about a quadriplegic child who was left on the banks of the @entity125 on the @entity7 side , showing the way that these cartels and gangs and smugglers operate			2
' both men pegged @entity12 's 2012 policy shift – his @entity134 announcement of a ' deferred action ' program to stop the deportation of people brought into the country as minors before june 2007 – sa the starting gun for the flood of children across @entity15 's southern border			1
' we are witnessing a humanitarian crisis unfolding that is a direct consequence of president @entity12 's lawlessness , ' @entity11 said			2
' @entity12 lawlessly granted amnesty to some 800,000 people here illegally who entered as children			1
and the direct consequence of that lawlessness , of that amnesty , is that we have seen the number of children taking the incredible risks that are entailed with coming across the border grow exponentially			2
' ' it has gone from 6,000 in 2011 , ' he said , ' to this year – it is expected to be 90,000 ...			0
next year the estimates are 145,000			0
' unspeakable horror : the lawmakers heard about sexual and physical assaults , including some cases where children were threatened with death if they refused to cut of other kids ' body parts to use as extortion bait with their parents @entity35 has ordered @entity1 law enforcement officers to plug the holes that he says @entity12 has left in @entity7 border security as @entity74 agents are transformed into glorified day care workers			1
and he 's demanding that the @entity178 cough up the funds needed to pay them			0
' while we have border control agents who are spending time taking care of the health care needs of these children , border control agents who are literally changing diapers and making baby formula , ' @entity35 told reporters , ' at that time we have the cartels who are engaging in their international trafficking operations , cartels who are importing crime into the @entity7 , importing into the @entity7 some of the most dangerous gang members around the globe			1
' drug cartels taking advantage of the diversion of federal law enforcement personnel , he claimed , ' may be making well over $ 100 million because of this operation			0
' ' the state of @entity1 is going to put the boots on the ground , ' @entity204 said , ' but we expect the federal government to foot the bill			2
' ' we are demanding that the federal government pay for the operations by the @entity213 to keep this state safe			0
' @entity11 shot back against the administration 's claim that regional violence , and not the president 's policies , are to blame for the avalanche of young people pouring into @entity1 , @entity222 and @entity223			1
' that is an explanation that makes no sense , ' @entity11 said			0
more help coming : @entity1 has put its own public safety personnel on the border , working alongside @entity74 agents and guided by @entity231 troops in @entity233 helicopters , in order to find illegal immigrants crossing into the @entity7 ' @entity236 in @entity15 explains the increase in immigrants from those countries , but there 's no reason why violence in @entity15 would cause more parents to send their kids alone			1
' ' you would expect to see more families coming to flee violence , ' he said			1
' we 've always seen that : whenever a region of the world is suffering under significant violence , we 've always seen an increase in immigration from those areas			0
but the shift here is dramatic			0
the shift here in particular focuses on unaccompanied minors			1
and the reason it does is not difficult to ascertain			0
' parents in @entity265 , @entity266 and @entity267 , he insisted , ' have been led to believe that all their child has to do is get to @entity15 and they will receive amnesty			1
' ' and as long as they believe that , we will see thousands upon thousands more little boys and little girls physically violated , sexually violated , subjected to unspeakable horrors			0
' in 2013 the @entity7 @entity74 recorded 2,346 rescues , 461 assaults , and 445 deaths along the border , mostly crimes in which illegal immigrants were the victims .			2

sen. @entity11 and @entity1 attorney general @entity35 toured @entity34 , where more than 1,000 children are being held after crossing the border illegally
drug dealers force children ' to cut off the fingers or cut off the ears of other little boys and little girls , in order to extort money from their families '
' and these children are told , " if you do n't cut off the fingers or ears of another child , you 'll be shot " '
@entity11 and @entity35 blame @entity12 for *suggesting* to @entity15 parents that their children can receive amnesty if they make it to the @entity7
@entity12 announced a policy in 2012 that ' deferred ' the deportation of 800,000 people brought into the @entity7 illegally as children through june 2007
@entity11 said @entity12 , not @entity15 violence , is at the root of a flood of children streaming into border states
' you would expect to see more families coming to flee violence , ' he said , but ' the shift here in particular focuses on unaccompanied minors '
