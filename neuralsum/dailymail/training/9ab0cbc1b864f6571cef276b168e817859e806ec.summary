@entity8 also suggested using @entity10 donations to pay for microwaves for police station kitchens and new gym equipment			1
the suggestions were given in 1991 after trustees of the fund asked the force for ideas on how to spend ' residual money '			1
@entity8 wanted to use money donated in memory of the 96 people killed at @entity6 for a holiday flat for officers			1

but a significant amount of ' residual ' funds remained , and its trustees asked police and other organisations for ideas on how they might be used			1
former @entity37 chief constable @entity36 , then a superintendent based in @entity8 ’s @entity54 , requested £ 2,000 to refurbish the reception area of his police station , according to the documents released by the @entity56			1
the proposal for a holiday flat ' either home or abroad ' came from chief inspector @entity59 , who was in charge of policing @entity62 city centre on the day of the disaster			1
he said it should be used by officers and their families			2
other ideas included new blinds for the force ’s casualty bureau and ' better gifts ' for officers on sick leave			1
none of the projects are believed to have been approved by the fund ’s trustees			0
the disaster fund included £ 100,000 from @entity24 , as well as money from @entity24 city council and the proceeds of a charity version of @entity83 featuring @entity32 and @entity33 , which was number one for three weeks in may and june , 1989			2
chair of the @entity86 , @entity87 , said : ' it is one of the most shocking things i ’ve heard in a long time			0
' it ’s not something i was previously aware of and to hear how , even in 1991 when it was clear to everyone that the police were to blame they were suggesting money should go to them to pay for microwaves and holidays , it is quite hard to believe			0
' and to hear @entity36 suggesting money should go to refurbish a police station is sickening			0
' people often think all of that money went to the families , but they are wrong			0
a lot of it went elsewhere			0
' i feel that 96 people died for that money - and they wanted to use it for new microwaves			0
' a total of 96 football fans died at @entity6 in 1989 because of overcrowding at the ground a policeman tells the referee to stop the match			0
@entity87 , chair of the @entity86 , said the police suggestions for spending the fund money is ' one of the most shocking things i 've heard ' a submission from the force ’s @entity125 asked for gymnasium equipment , including exercise bikes , and microwaves , which it said were ' always being requested ' at police stations			1
in his proposal , mr @entity36 identified the police control room at @entity6 as being in need of repair , but concluded ' the room is the responsibility of the @entity138 and the police would therefore be deriving no benefit from such a contribution			0
' he added : ' i therefore propose a preferred option that if funds are available then @entity145 , which was used as a reception area for friends and relatives of those who died in the disaster , should benefit			0
' @entity150 , of the @entity151 said : ' what makes me feel so angry about this is the fact that i asked the disaster fund would they give a small amount of money for a person who lost a family member at @entity6 for her bus fares to college for an access course			1
@entity150 , of the @entity151 , said it shows the ' contempt officers had for the families ' ' and the reply i received was " no , the families have already had money "			2
i think there are people very close to @entity6 who have to search their consciences now for what they agreed to in allowing those funds to be wound up			0
' she added : ' this shows the contempt authorities had for @entity6 families and victims			2
' deputy chief constable @entity181 from @entity8 told the @entity182 said the force formally submitted suggestions after being approached by trustees of the fund			1
he told the @entity182 : ' as a result , @entity8 formally submitted a number of suggestions to the trustees of the @entity10 which included enhancing the quality of the police control rooms at @entity6 and other football stadia to improve public safety and the policing of future football matches			1
' other suggestions included the provision of better equipment for the @entity200 , the creation of an @entity202 and a number of community - based projects			0
