the promoter who organised the farcical @entity2 boxing bout in @entity3 has admitted it was simply a public relations stunt in which the star chose his own opponent			1
the ' fight ' , which has been ridiculed around the world , saw the 62 - year - old beat @entity11 star beat @entity12 , a 29 - year - old homeless boxer from @entity13			1
but while he confessed that he was not expecting a ' super outstanding match ' , the man behind the bout @entity16 , denied that @entity12 had thrown the fight			1
he lost the fight ( pictured above ) in the second round after defeating @entity32 in the second round of friday 's fight @entity2 ( left , during the match and , right , after ) celebrated by carrying his trainer @entity36 on his shoulders and parading him around the ring he said : ' maybe earlier somebody thought this would be a match for the ratings ? of course , it was a show , this is obvious			1
what 's the problem ? ' i expected to see @entity2 and a show which people would like , ' he said			1
' but the main story was about @entity2			1
it is good for us , the more noise around this event the better			2
he added : ' it is a sort of @entity58 for us , and you know , there is no bad pr except an obituary			2
so @entity2 worked 100 per cent			1
' @entity16 , who runs a promotion outfit called @entity22 added that he did ' not admit any guilt , ' adding that he thought the fight had done well			1
' people gathered to watch @entity2 and his boxing match , ' he said			1
' and now they are saying it was a show , we unmasked you			2
@entity32 ( pictured right and left ) , is a drifter who trained at the same @entity72 gym and @entity2 and was paid to fly to @entity73 to make the actor ' look good ’ - a claim the boxer has denied @entity2 's manager @entity77 said he had sparred with the 62 - year - old @entity11 star before the fight and that he was in ' great shape			1
he also helped to pick his client 's opponent like @entity12 himself , @entity16 also denied the homeless pugilist had been paid to fall over in the second round of the match			1
he said : ' it was not ' fixed ' at all , it was a fair match			2
an opponent for @entity2 was chosen according to his condition , age and skills , so he could compete and had a chance to win			1
but it was not ' fixed '			2
' but he admitted that @entity2 and his aides chose @entity32 , who they knew from his sports club in @entity99			1
' @entity2 is my friend , he asked me if we could put his match as a part of our programme that night , ' said @entity16 who did not reveal how much money the fighters were paid for the bout			1
he added that @entity2 and his @entity73 agent @entity77 , ' chose the opponent together			1
' ' visit the website @entity111 where boxer profiles can be found , and @entity2 's rival is presented there , ' he continued			1
' he is a professional boxer			0
yes , he is not a good boxer , but this is a secondary question			0
' ' if an ordinary man from the street meets him at the boxing ring , he will be punished			0
in other words , this guy is a weak boxer but he is a boxer			0
' pointing to @entity32 's physique he insisted that the struggling fighter was a ' serious muscleman ' and despite clear evidence to the contrary he said : ' he does not look like a homeless man at all			0
' ' it is clear that the boxers are not the richest guys in this world , except the stars , of course			0
but it is not important in this case , ' he said			0
' it is important that he is a professional boxer			0
the matter of his financial wealth is not interesting for us			0
pictured with @entity73 boxing champion @entity141 , @entity77 who also manages @entity2 , has also denied the bout was fixed ' besides , before the match he passed a medical commission and he was officially allowed to box that night			1
so there is nothing to talk about here , we have done all this at a good quality level			0
' @entity77 , variously described as @entity2 's manager in @entity73 and a co-organiser of the fight , was also quick to defend the choice of @entity32 as an opponent			1
' he is not the richest nor the most pathetic sportsman , ' he said			0
' maybe he can be called poor , as many sportsmen of his age are			0
maybe from time to time he earns some money as a sparring partner			0
' he added that having trained and sparred with @entity2 he could say with confidence that the film star was in ' perfect shape			2
' @entity2 ( left ) and @entity12 ( right ) before the fight in @entity73 on friday @entity164 , 29 , the manager at the @entity165 that @entity32 bases himself in ( pictured above ) , confirmed the boxer was currently homeless , adding he was well liked by staff and customers another source close to the fight added that having considered @entity2 's age , an opponent was chosen of a certain weight , talent and skills			1
but they insisted , ' it is not correct to say that we bought a homeless ' punch bag ' for @entity2			2
for his part , @entity32 has also denied throwing the fight and has instead claimed that he did not have long enough to prepare for the ring			2
' the fight was n't thrown , ' he said in an earlier interview			0
' i only had one month to train			0
' when asked how much money he was paid for the fight , the 29 - year - old @entity187 drifter pointed to a photo of $ 100 bills fanned out on a bed that has been posted on his @entity194 page			2
@entity32 , pictured aged 23 after winning his @entity197 amateur title , admired boxer @entity198 as he was growing up from the picture it appears that @entity12 earned just over $ 3,000 for facing @entity2 in the ring			1
but his claims were contradicted by a source close to his family who told @entity204 sunday that the cash - strapped vagrant was paid to fly to @entity3 to make @entity2 ' look good			1
' ' it was clearly a fixed fight , ' they said			0
' the whole bouncing off the ropes , hands down , punches were not landing and they were intentionally hitting each other ’s gloves			0
' there are people at @entity217 gym who know that @entity12 ’s in a really terrible situation and pretty much living on the streets , these are @entity2 ’s people who @entity12 ’s been around and known for some time			1
' revealing the sad back story of the fighter , the family source said he had been on the streets since may 2013			0
' he ’s pretty much hanging out at @entity165 , very disheveled , people have taken him clothes because he just smelled horrible , he had n’t bathed and had n’t changed clothes for several days , ' they said			0
' he does n’t have a place to live consistently if he ’s doing anything he ’s couch surfing			0
' he spends nights in the local park			0
i know he crashed with friends sometimes , but he ’s pretty much burned bridges with his friends			0
' @entity164 , 29 , the manager at the @entity239 bases himself in , also confirmed the boxer was currently homeless , adding he was well liked by staff and customers			2
he said : ' he ’s in here all the time , he hangs out here and comes in right when we open at 5am			0
i knew he was homeless			0
@entity16 , a vice president of the @entity73 professional @entity247 , chose to blame @entity250 media negative publicity			1
he said : ' nowadays the @entity250 media hunts for any information which would discredit @entity73			2
' do n't you remember how the @entity250 press covered the @entity255 ? ' a representative for @entity2 has been asked for a comment .			2

promoter @entity16 said the bout was obviously a show
he said @entity2 and his manager *handpicked* opponent @entity12
he denied @entity12 had been paid to fall down in the second round
blames *anti-russia* bias in the *western* media for the *criticism*
