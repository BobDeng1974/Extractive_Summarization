by @entity0 published : 03:57 est , 6 december 2012 updated : 19:37 est , 6 december 2012 first minister @entity1 has insisted an independent @entity2 would automatically join the @entity5 - something @entity4 disputes nationalists have reacted angrily to a warning that an independent @entity2 would have to re-apply to the @entity5			1
eurocrats say @entity2 would not have automatic membership if @entity2 decide to break away in the 2014 independence referendum			2
a leaked letter from the @entity12 said the @entity14 ’s @entity5 membership would ‘ cease to apply ’ to an independent @entity2			1
the letter , seen by @entity17 newspaper , was destined for the @entity19 economic affairs sub-committee			2
it stated : ‘ if a territory of a member state ceases to be part of that member state because it has become an independent state , then the treaties would cease to apply to that territory			0
’ but @entity29 members insisted they would have to ‘ renegotiate ’ rather than re-apply for membership			0
finance secretary @entity31 said @entity2 would still be part of the @entity14 in the immediate aftermath of a vote for independence			1
he added : ‘ @entity2 would not be applying for membership			2
@entity2 is already a member of the @entity5 , our citizens are @entity5 citizens today , we follow all of the @entity5 relevant provisions that we are required to follow			0
‘ assuming there is a yes vote , @entity2 will still be at that stage a part of the @entity14 , and what we have always accepted is there has to be a negotiation about the details and the terms of @entity2 ’s membership of the @entity5			1
‘ but crucially that would be taking place at a time when we are still part of the @entity14 , and still part of the @entity5 of which we have been members for 40 years			0
’ he told the @entity59 ’s @entity58 there was an important distinction between @entity2 ‘ applying ’ and ‘ negotiating ’			0
but @entity62 , the president of the @entity12 , appeared to confirm that membership treaties would no longer apply to a newly independent country			1
the scottish independence referendum is being held in autumn 2014 , when mr @entity1 hopes to capitalise on a patriotic mood marking 700th anniversary of the @entity68 in a written answer to @entity71 mep @entity70 , mr @entity62 referred to previous legal advice issued in 2004			0
an independent @entity2 would also have to be unanimously approved for membership by all other @entity5 countries			2
but @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 could be reluctant to do so as they are battling with nationalists at home			0
@entity75 foreign minister @entity81 suggested in october that @entity2 ‘ would have to get to the back of the queue ’ if it wanted to re-apply to the @entity5 .			1
