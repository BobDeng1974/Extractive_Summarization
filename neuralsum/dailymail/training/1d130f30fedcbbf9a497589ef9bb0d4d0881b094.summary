under threat : @entity2 dairy products and the farms which produce them are under threat from cheap , often poor quality , foreign imports every day for the past three decades , @entity8 and @entity9 have risen at 4.45am to begin milking their 500 @entity11 cows on their 370 - acre dairy farm near @entity13 , @entity14			1
they do not finish tending to them until 10.30pm			0
‘ cows do n’t allow you to take a rest , ’ says @entity8			0
‘ we work 365 days a year			2
’ @entity9 , 65 , and @entity8 , 52 , took over @entity21 from @entity9 ’s father 30 years ago			0
with the help of their son @entity25 , 26 , they produce 7,000 litres of milk a day , which is sold to a nearby dairy processor and distributed to retailers around the country			1
the couple hope @entity25 will continue the family business when they retire			2
despite putting in 18 - hour days , @entity8 and @entity9 are struggling			0
they receive 33¼p per litre of milk — which , says @entity8 , is barely enough to cover the cost of producing it			0
‘ we scrimp and save , mend and make do , but i do n’t know why we should be under such pressure , ’ she says			0
such is the situation faced by thousands of @entity2 dairy farmers			1
two decades of relentless price slashing by supermarkets has seen them unable to break even — let alone earn a living			1
in 2012 , the average dairy farm was losing around £ 40,000 a year			1
@entity8 has seen dozens of her friends in the farming community simply give up and seek a different way of making a living			0
the number of dairy farms has plummeted from more than 34,000 in 1996 to just over 10,000 today			1
@entity2 dairy products are being replaced by cheap , often poor quality , foreign imports			1
as recently as 2008 , @entity2 was entirely self - sufficient in dairy produce			1
now , @entity2 - produced goods account for only 80 per cent of the market			1
some £ 2.6 billion worth of dairy products are imported annually			1
and , to the horror of farmers , things are about to get worse			0
last monday , @entity65 — which has seen its profits tumble , faced with competition from budget stores @entity68 and @entity69 — fired the opening salvo in a supermarket price war that is almost certain to see milk prices falling again			1
the grocery giant announced it would be cutting the price of its four - pint ( 2.27 litres ) milk bottles by an unprecedented 39p , from £ 1.39 to £ 1			1
the price of a six - pint ( 3.41 litres ) bottle of milk is down from £ 1.99 to £ 1.48			1
the move brings it into line with @entity82 , @entity68 and @entity69 , which have sold four pints of milk at £ 1 for more than a year			1
it also means milk at @entity65 is cheaper than many mineral waters			0
this sounds like good news for the consumer — but only in the short term			0
farmers fear it could eventually spell the end of the @entity2 dairy industry			1
to @entity96 , the news was a slap in the face			0
‘ they are trying to devalue a wholesome product , ’ she says			0
‘ it makes me livid			0
’ ' they are trying to devalue a wholesome product ' : @entity9 and @entity96 , who run a dairy farm in @entity105 , @entity14 , are ' livid ' at @entity65 's decision to slash the price of its milk to just 25p a pint when announcing the cut , @entity65 proudly declared that its suppliers would n’t suffer			1
the supermarket gets its own - brand milk from a select group of 650 farmers , who will still be paid above the cost of production			0
for the other 9,000 - odd dairy farmers in @entity2 , however , such assurances offer little comfort			1
‘ they claim it wo n’t affect us , but it ’s a lie , ’ says @entity121 , a dairy farmer from @entity122 , who chairs the grassroots @entity124 campaign			2
‘ every other retailer will want to follow suit			0
’ though @entity65 farmers may be insulated , the majority of dairy farmers — around 75 per cent — do n’t belong to price - guaranteed pools			1
they sell directly to processors , who set their prices according to what retailers will pay			0
‘ the whole supply chain will come under pressure , ’ says @entity142 , chair of the @entity144 milk board			0
‘ soon , someone will come along and try to undercut @entity65			0
’ sure enough , on tuesday @entity148 ’s also slashed the price of four pints from £ 1.39 to £ 1			1
the co-operative cut the price of one and two - pint bottles to 45p and 85p			2
on friday , @entity154 — having insisted it had no plans to cut milk prices — reduced four - pint bottles from £ 1.39 to £ 1 for customers with a mywaitrose card			2
@entity159 , meanwhile , undercut them all by reducing two - litre cartons of @entity163 milk — equivalent to just over 3.5 pints — from 97p to 84p ( meaning it costs around 24p a pint )			0
how long until every retailer in @entity2 does the same ? and how long before @entity65 tries to gain the commercial edge again by cutting its price further ? race to the bottom : @entity148 's responded to @entity65 's price cut by slashing its milk prices to match , while @entity159 went further and cut the price of its milk to the equivalent of 24p a pint it ’s the latest chapter in a struggle that began in 1994 , when the @entity178 , which had previously set milk prices according to production costs , was abolished			1
the move shifted power away from farmers and into the hands of supermarkets , who began demanding ever - cheaper produce			2
whereas in 1997 dairy farmers were receiving 25p per litre of milk , by 2006 it was 17p per litre — 4p less than the 21p cost of making it			2
by 2010 , it was back up to around 25p per litre , but 5p below the cost of production			0
as a result , consumers developed a growing — and , say farmers , unrealistic — expectation that milk should be available cheaply			0
some warned that the only way for the @entity2 dairy industry to survive would be to go the way of the @entity205 , and reorganise farms into so - called ‘ mega farms ’ , where thousands of animals are reared indoors and production costs are lower			1
already , cows are suffering			0
the average yield per cow has more than doubled in the past 40 years			2
in 2012 , @entity2 cows produced an average of 7,604 litres each during their ten - month lactation — nearly 1,000 more than ten years ago			1
this increased demand places the animals under physical strain			0
@entity219 can result in disease and infection and shorten their working lives			0
whereas dairy cows can live up to 20 - 25 years , producing milk for 15 years , today the average @entity2 cow has just three years of milking , and is then sent to slaughter			1
meanwhile , with more than two dairy farms going out of business every day in @entity2 , farming has one of the highest suicide rates of any profession			1
suffering : the average yield per cow has more than doubled in the past 40 years , an increased strain that places the animals under strain , resulting in disease and infection and shortening their working lives but the supermarkets have n’t suffered			1
their average gross margin — the difference between the price they sell milk for , and the price they pay farmers or milk processors — is estimated to be more than 30 per cent			1
little wonder farmers have begun taking matters into their own hands			2
in july 2012 , more than 2,000 took part in protests around the country , blockading milk - processing plants and disrupting supermarket supplies			2
ironically , until @entity65 ’s latest move , it appeared their action might have paid off			0
following the protests , the then farming minister @entity262 drew up a ‘ voluntary code of conduct ’ for processors allowing farmers to terminate contracts if they could no longer afford to produce at the price offered			2
a number of supermarkets established ‘ pools ’ of dedicated milk suppliers to whom they guaranteed the cost of production — an approach pioneered by @entity278 in 2000			2
several processors , including @entity280 , which supplies @entity159 , and @entity281 , which supplies @entity148 ’s , increased the price paid to farmers			0
with the cost of production at around 28 - 30p per litre , the average farmer was , by the start of this year , receiving around 31p per litre			1
given that the average farm produces around a million litres a year , that works out at a household income of £ 10,000 — not even the minimum wage , but an improvement on recent years			1
the fact that @entity65 ’s price cut should come at the moment when , for the first time in more than a decade , dairy producers had reason to be optimistic only makes it harder to swallow			2
for some , the writing is already on the wall			0
for example , this is the first year @entity303 and @entity304 wo n’t be producing any milk on their second - generation farm in @entity308			0
having worked 12 hours day , seven days a week for more than a decade , they have given up after what @entity304 , 59 , describes as ‘ years of not making a penny ’ , and are selling off their dairy cows one by one .			2

more than two @entity2 dairy farms go out of business every day
the average dairy firm was in 2012 losing £ 40,000 a year
and now supermarkets have begun another price war over dairy products
