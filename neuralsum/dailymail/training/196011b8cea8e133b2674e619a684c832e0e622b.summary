ladies ' man ? @entity1 with his wife @entity2 - who , as a woman , he concedes is ' better at finding the mustard in the pantry ' than a man employment law should be torn up to allow small firms to sack women workers who get pregnant , @entity7 mep @entity1 has suggested			1
the @entity11 and @entity12 said that owners of smaller businesses were too scared to hire women of childbearing age because of maternity and anti-discrimination laws			1

he said there should be ' liberty of contract ' which would see a woman replaced for a job if she had children			0
' young women would much rather have a job under liberty of contract than not be given a job because of the fears some employers might have ' , he told @entity38 's @entity37			1
he had argued that feminism had ' done no favours ' for the ' sisterhood ' and that maternity rights in employment law had been bad for women			1

' most women can find the mustard in the pantry quicker than a man and most men can reverse a car better than a woman			1
' he predicted that feminism was a passing fashion , created by ' shrill , bored , middle class women of a certain physical genre '			2
the only male supporters of feminism were men ' who seem to have no link with the usual social and sporting male preserves , the slightly effete politically correct chaps who get sand kicked in their face on the beach '			2
the feminists of the 1970s were actually ' hostile to other women ' and had done ' the sisterhood no favours '			2
@entity106 : mr @entity1 , whocreated a stir when he walked out on an interview with @entity109 on @entity110 earlier this month , said he would ' happily punch the first man who tries to steal my beer ' the former businessman said he was puzzled that women had produced so few great works in the arts despite having much more time on their hands in the 18th and 19th centuries ' women , in spite of years of training in art and music - and significant leisure time in the 18th and 19th @entity126 - have produced few great works , ' he said.mr @entity1 's comments came just weeks after he sparked outrage by claiming that foreign aid was going to ' bongo - bong land '			1
women were more interested in tidying the house than getting ahead in business			2
' men and women care about different things on a micro-scale , ' he said			2
' leaving the lavatory seat up , wet towels on the bed and the top left off the toothpaste will drive a wife mad			0
a man simply can not understand what the problem is			0
' most wives do not regard putting petrol in the car as any part of their responsibility			0
