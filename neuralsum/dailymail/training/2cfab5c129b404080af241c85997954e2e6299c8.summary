by @entity0 @entity1 : 11:17 est , 22 december 2013 @entity2 : 04:53 est , 23 december 2013 education secretary @entity3 is calling for schools to be given more control on workday and term lengths schools could open until 6pm for up to 51 weeks a year under controversial government proposals to create more flexible days , it was revealed today			1
education secretary @entity3 wants to give schools more powers over the working hours available to teachers as well as holidays and pay			1
schools already have the freedom to set their own term dates and vary the length of days , which could signal the end of the long summer holidays for thousands of children			1
however , in a submission to the @entity25 ’ @entity22 ( @entity23 ) , an independent panel that vets teachers ’ pay , mr @entity3 is pushing for an overhaul of teachers ’ working conditions			1
he said that many schools are unable to take advantage of current government reforms ‘ because of the restrictive terms under which they currently employ teachers ’			0
teachers ’ contracts stipulate that they should work 1,265 hours over 195 days a year , of which five days a year are out of the classroom for duties other than direct teaching			0
mr @entity3 wants this ‘ central specification of teachers ’ working days and hours ’ removed from the @entity25 ’ pay and @entity39 ( @entity40 ) and for teachers to cover for absent colleagues more regularly			1
he is also targeting a list of 21 tasks including photocopying and collecting money from pupils that teachers are currently prevented from carrying out under existing deals			0
in his submission to the @entity23 , mr @entity3 said that current provisions are ‘ overly prescriptive ’			2
he pointed to evidence from the @entity52 , that ‘ extended school hours that provide opportunities for additional high - quality activities can have real benefits for children ’s education ’			1
he said : ‘ children in the @entity60 are also often learning for many more hours than their peers in @entity62 , giving them a critical edge when they leave school			2
‘ we want schools in this country to learn from these examples , and some of them already do			0
‘ the @entity70 in @entity71 operates a seven - term year starting in june , with a maximum of six weeks at school followed by a maximum of four weeks ’ holiday			2
‘ all @entity76 schools operate a longer school day : at secondary level , @entity76 schools are open from 8.30am - 4.30pm monday to thursday and 8.30am - 3pm on fridays , providing 31 hours teaching per week			2
’ mr @entity3 praised the @entity80 , pictured , which is open 51 weeks a year mr @entity3 also praised the @entity80 which is open 51 weeks a year and is ‘ proving very popular with parents struggling with childcare costs ’			2
it provides an extended school service from 8.15am to 5.45pm during term time and throughout holidays , with one week off at @entity87			1
mr @entity3 said there was a ‘ strong case for a reform of the current working time provisions ’			2
he insisted this was ‘ not about making teachers work longer hours without some form of compensation ’ , pointing to @entity93 ’ contracts that enable them to operate between 8am and 5pm			0
‘ teachers are expected to be available in the school and to cover most of their work within this longer school day , but no teacher would teach continuously throughout the day , ’ mr @entity3 said			1
general secretary of the nut , @entity104 , said the move would be a mistake on teachers ' conditions of service ‘ the expectation is that in most cases the teaching load would be no greater than at other schools			1
’ however , the proposed overhaul will be fiercely opposed by teaching unions , which are already threatening further strike action in the @entity117			0
the @entity103 and the @entity118 launched a rolling programme of industrial action across the country earlier this year over pensions , workload and the introduction of performance - related pay			0
@entity104 , general secretary of the @entity103 , said yesterday : ‘ we have a ballot , which means we can take strike action before the middle of february			1
‘ from the government ’s moves on pay , we know that ministers are enthusiastic about deregulation			0
‘ i think it is a mistake on pay and it would be even more of a mistake on teachers ’ conditions of service			0
’ in a recent interview , sir @entity141 , @entity142 ’s chief inspector of schools , said the six - week school holiday was ‘ too long ’			1
the @entity23 is due to report back by january 14 , after which the government will decide whether to accept its recommendations			0
a @entity150 spokesman said : ‘ we are giving all schools the freedom to set the length of the school day and term to meet the needs of their parents and pupils			1
‘ many free schools and academies are already using these freedoms , for example the @entity70 which runs a seven term year and @entity165 which have lengthened the day in all their primary and secondary schools			0
‘ we have also cut red tape to make it easier for schools to open longer and offer on - site childcare and in april we asked the @entity23 to look at whether heads should have more flexibility over staff conditions , so it is easier to extend the school day , without it being centrally prescribed from @entity179			0
