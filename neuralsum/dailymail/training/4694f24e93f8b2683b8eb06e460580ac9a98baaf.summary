@entity0 is just around the corner , and for many of us that means spending days lounging about with bloated stomachs and nursing hangovers after one too many			2
but what ’s the science behind such over-indulging and why do our bodies feel so full after eating too much ? the answer is revealed in a video that explains why too much turkey during the festive period can leave you unable to swallow another morsel of food			1
in the video on their reactions page they detail the processes taking place ( illustrated ) when we over-indulge in certain foods			1
our stomach has a finite size and squeezes other organs when it 's full the video was created by the @entity20 ’s @entity35 channel reactions			1
they explain that , when you eat a big meal , part of the reason you can feel full is down to the size of your stomach			1
‘ your stomach can stretch the volume of about one litre ; that ’s about the size of a burrito , ’ the narrator says			1
in 2012 , @entity48 , a professor of clinical paediatrics at the @entity50 , explained a new scientific theory on why people eat too much			2
he argues that the urge to overeat and lounge around doing nothing is not a sign of weakness			0
it is , he says , a hormonal issue , triggered by eating too much sugar			0
he points the finger of blame at the hormone leptin , which acts like an appetite thermostat			0
as one of two ‘ hunger hormones ’ in the body , leptin works to decrease the appetite ( its partner , ghrelin , increases appetite )			0
when you have had enough to eat , your fat cells release leptin , which effectively dulls the appetite by instructing the brain that it ’s time to stop eating			1
but professor @entity48 warns that our sweet tooth can send this process haywire and , if you are leptin - resistant , food never stops tasting delicious , no matter how much of it you choose to eat			0
‘ when you eat a big meal you fill your stomach to its limits , squeezing against your other organs and making your abdomen feel , well , full			1
’ when eating your stomach and intestines also fill with gases , not only from food and drink but also gulps of air when you swallow anything			1
this additional air adds to the swollen sensation you get after eating			1
@entity98 drinks can make you feel especially full , as the gas that makes them fizzy - namely carbon dioxide - can fill more space than the liquid it came in			2
your body can get rid of this gas though - in the form of burps and other methods that do n’t need to be explained			0
‘ for some people another uncomfortable result of a big meal is heartburn , ’ the video continues			2
‘ the stomach produces hydrochloric acid to break down food			0
more food to break down means more acid , which can creep into the oesophagus , leading to that burning feeling			0
’ antacid tablets can alleviate this pain using bases , which are at the opposite end of the ph scale , to neutralise the acids			0
doing this , however , can release more carbon dioxide and increase the feeling of being full			2
ingesting air and gas can also lead to people feeling more bloated , while our brain also sends out hormones to warn us to stop eating when it detects we 've got too much fat in our bodies			1
the bloated feeling will be felt by many come @entity0 time ( stock image shown ) but it ’s not just on a physical level that you can feel full ; your brain also sends signals to stop you eating when it thinks you ’ve had enough			1
it releases a hormone called leptin when the amount of fat in your body reaches a certain level , which inhibits hunger			0
in addition , the video says : ‘ when you eat a high - calorie meal , cells in your intestines secrete a hormone called peptide tyrosine - tyrosine , or @entity164			0
‘ when @entity164 reaches the brain , it binds with receptors that give you the feeling that you ’re full			1
maybe even a little queasy			0
’ other hormones also have a similar purpose , to get you to stop eating when you ’ve had too much			1
but for some , come @entity0 time , there ’s simply too much delicious food available for any notice to be given to these hormones			0
and instead , they ’ll be left to deal with the biological repercussions of over-eating			0
