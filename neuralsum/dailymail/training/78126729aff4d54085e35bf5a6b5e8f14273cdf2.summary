@entity1 's first bus powered by human waste has taken to the streets			1
the 40 - seater ' @entity4 ' is fuelled by biomethane gas , generated by the treatment of sewage and food waste at a processing plant in the south west			1
and a single tank of the gas - produced using the typical annual waste of just five people - is enough to power the vehicle for 190 miles ( 305km )			1
commuters today boarded the first bus in the @entity1 to be powered by this waste from local residents bosses said the groundbreaking vehicle will improve air quality , and proves that their is value in human faeces			2
today 's maiden voyage saw the first passengers travel on the route from @entity35 to @entity36 , @entity37 - a distance of around 20 miles ( 32km )			2
faeces could soon be used to power a future generation of mobile phones , scientists from the @entity40 have claimed			0
the researchers discovered a natural process that occurs within the bacteria found in poo , that could help improve ‘ bio batteries ’			0
it is hoped the discovery could produce energy for portable technology , such as smartphones , mobiles , tablets and laptops			0
the gas is being produced at a @entity59 sewerage plant , run by energy firm @entity60			0
@entity61 , director of @entity62 , told @entity63 : ' gas powered vehicles have an important role to play in improving air quality in @entity1 cities			0
' but the @entity4 goes further than that and is actually powered by people living in the local area , including quite possibly those on the bus itself			0
' the annual waste of a bus - load of people would provide enough power for a return journey from @entity79 to @entity80 , while producing fewer emissions than a diesel engine			1
@entity83 , chief executive of eco-friendly organisation @entity84 and @entity85 , said : ' the bus also clearly shows that human poo and our wasted food are valuable resources			1
' food which is unsuitable for human consumption should be separately collected and recycled through anaerobic digestion into green gas and biofertilisers , not wasted in landfill sites or incinerators			0
' the 40 - seater ' @entity4 ' , pictured here preparing for its maiden trip from @entity35 to @entity36 , runs on gas generated by the treatment of sewage and food waste at a nearby processing plant			1
it comes complete with an interesting design on the side of the vehicle bio-fuel promoters said that the bus , which is expected to ferry up to 10,000 passengers a month , shows the ' value ' of waste and heralds a more sustainable future for public transport @entity114 this week also became the first company to start delivering gas generated from human waste directly to 8,300 homes by the national grid			2
the waste plant in @entity121 , @entity35 , treats 75 million cubic metres of sewage waste , and 35,000 tonnes of food waste , every year			2
using anaerobic digestion - the process of using bacteria to break down substances in the absence of oxygen - the plant is able to produce 17 million tonnes of biomethane a year			0
the annual waste of a bus - load of people would provide enough power for a return journey from @entity79 to @entity80 while producing fewer emissions than a diesel engine today 's maiden voyage saw the first passengers travel on the route from @entity35 to @entity36 , @entity37			1
@entity83 of @entity84 and @entity85 , said : ' the bus clearly shows that human poo and our wasted food are valuable resources '			1

bus powered by human waste takes maiden journey from @entity36 to @entity35
the bio-bus is fuelled by biomethane gas from sewage and food waste
a single tank of ' gas ' is the *equivalent* annual waste from five people
but the bus produces less emissions than those from a diesel engine
it 's hoped the bus could herald more sustainable fuels for travel
' the bus also clearly shows that human poo and our wasted food are valuable resources , ' said one expert
