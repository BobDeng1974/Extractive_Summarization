by @entity0 theory : more than 150 years after @entity4 noted that animals were tamer on his beloved @entity6 , his theory has been proved right by scientists more than 150 years after @entity4 noted that animals were tamer on his beloved @entity6 , his theory has been proved right by scientists			2
the celebrated naturalist and geologist had casually observed that island animals often appeared tame , and questioned if they had evolved in that way after inhabiting areas without many predators			2
the idea was an off - shoot of @entity4 's evolutionary theories regarding natural selection , in which animals would change , and eventually become better suited to their environment over subsequent generations			0
now , 183 years after @entity4 embarked on his voyage on @entity27 , which took him to the @entity6 , off the coast of @entity29 , a team of scientists have proven that island lizards are in fact ' tame ' , compared with their mainland cousins			1
the researchers from the @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity37 @entity36 and @entity38 found that they were able to approach island lizards and get far closer to them then they could mainland lizards			1
' our study confirms @entity4 's observations and numerous anecdotal reports of island tameness , ' @entity43 , from @entity35 told @entity49			0
' his insights have once again proven to be correct , and remain an important source of inspiration for present - day biologists			0
' as part of the research , which will appear in the @entity57 next month , the experts analysed the correlation between flight initiation distance - the moment in which a predator 's prey starts to flee , distance from the mainland , island area and activities of 66 different species of lizards			1
ca n't be tamed : scientists have found that mainland lizards , such as this desert iguana in @entity73 , appear less ' tame ' than their island cousins studies focussed on lizards from five continents and islands in the @entity80 and @entity79 , and the @entity81 and @entity82 , with the results revealing that the flight initiation distance decreased as the distance from the mainland increased			1
professor @entity43 said that the escape responses are lessened on remote islands because there are fewer predators , so natural selection favours animals that do not need to flee			0
the team also discovered that the size of the prey can affect its escape behaviour , as when animals are very small compared to their predators they are not attacked individually			0
' this results in the absence of fleeing or very short flight initiation distance , ' said professor @entity43			1
research : studies focussed on lizards from five continents and islands in the @entity80 and @entity79 , and the @entity106 , such as the @entity107 from @entity108			0

@entity4 asked if island animals were affected by a lack of predators
scientists found they could get closer to island lizards than mainland ones
island lizards have a shorter flight initiation distance - the point at which prey will flee from a predator
