by @entity0 published : 12:40 est , 21 november 2012 updated : 15:23 est , 21 november 2012 car makers around the world have , for decades , regarded the appropriate place to put airbags as on the inside of their vehicles			1
now a team of @entity10 researchers have turned that received knowledge on its head with their latest invention - an electric car covered in cushions			1
@entity17 , a startup business affiliated with @entity19 , has recently revealed the golf cart - like vehicle , which is covered in airbag - like cushions that spring back into shape after absorbing impacts			0
@entity25 : the @entity10 - designed electric car turns received wisdom about airbags on its head by putting shock absorbing cushions all around the outside of the vehicle mmm , soft : a man tests out the cushioning with his hand the company , formed by researchers from the university , is set to bring the innovative vehicle to market - dubbed @entity25 - for a mere 790,000 yen ( about £ 6,000 )			1
professor @entity41 , president of @entity42 , told @entity10 magazine @entity43 : ' the car will be perfect for our rapidly ageing society and we 've already has many enquiries from elderly and disabled people			2
' the shock - absorbing cushions protecting the outside of the vehicle are made of sponge , covered with tent fabric			0
every side of the car , except the roof and underbody , is fitted with the impact - absorbing pillows , particularly at the front and rear			0
ultra safe : the @entity63 is so well - cushioned it can even pin pedestrians against the wall without doing them any harm			0
its makers say they have had a lot of enquiries from elderly and disabled people about the vehicle infographic : for @entity10 speakers , this image offers information about the @entity76 vehicle while the cars cushioning is intended to absorb the energy in the event of an impact , it 's not clear how much this will contribute to passenger safety in a high speed crash			2
but since the vehicle only has a top speed of about 30mph , it 's unlikely to be too much of an issue			1
the video below even shows how it can be driven into bystanders causing minimal harm			0
a single charge will run the @entity93 for 18 miles and it can be recharged from any regular household plug			1
apart from the vital safety aspect , the @entity42 website claims that the biggest advantage of their vehicle is the ease with which it can be registered			0
because of its light structure , the @entity63 can be registered in @entity10 as a trike and it only needs a single inspection by authorities .			2
