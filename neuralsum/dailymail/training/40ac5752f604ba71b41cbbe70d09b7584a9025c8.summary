@entity11 's daughter @entity10 was killed during the slaughter in an @entity13 , @entity15 movie theater last summer during a premiere of the new @entity18 movie , @entity19			0
when judge @entity20 announced @entity6 would not have to enter a plea on his charges of murder and attempted murder until march , the crowd of family and victims became noticeably angry			1
' i am terribly sorry for your loss and i can only begin to imagine the emotions that are raging , ' @entity20 told him			1
@entity20 ruled thursday night that prosecutors had presented sufficient evidence at a preliminary hearing to proceed toward trial on charges that @entity6 killed 12 people and injured 70 others at a suburban @entity53 movie theater on july 20			1
@entity20 had asked @entity6 if he objected to the delay and defense attorney @entity55 answered for him , saying he did not			1
defense lawyers did n't say why they wanted to delay entering a plea			0
one possible reason could be to seek a mental health evaluation by a doctor of their choosing			0
lawyers for @entity6 have said he is mentally ill , raising the possibility of an insanity defense			1
if @entity6 had entered an insanity plea today , an evaluation would be done by state doctors			1
sick : @entity6 took pictures of himself dressed as the @entity70 before allegedly committing mass murder prosecutors objected to the delay and said they were ready to move ahead			1
@entity20 said he understood their position but wanted to make sure he did not do anything that could lay the grounds for an appeal			0
' we want to avoid at all costs doing anything improper , ' the judge said			0
following the hearing , district attorney @entity82 , who took office this week , did n't specifically address the delay but said he wanted to ' protect the interests of all involved in this case			2
' if @entity6 , 25 , is convicted of first - degree murder , he could face the death penalty			2
prosecutors have not said whether they would pursue that sentence			0
grief : victims and family members leave an @entity13 courtroom today loss : @entity96 , center , walks into court			2
@entity96 's husband @entity99 was killed during the shooting			0
the hearing capped an emotional week in which the public , including victims and their families , got the first look at evidence gathered against @entity6 and heard police officers describe attempts to save the wounded			1
during the preliminary hearing , witnesses testified that @entity6 spent weeks amassing an arsenal and planning the attack at a midnight showing of ' @entity19 , ' and that he took photos of himself hours before the shooting , including one that showed him grinning with a handgun			1
they also detailed an elaborate booby trap set up at @entity6 ' apartment designed to explode at the same time the theater attack occurred several miles away			1
prosecution witnesses testified that @entity6 began acquiring weapons in early may , and by july 6 he had two semi-automatic pistols , a shotgun , a semi-automatic rifle , 6,200 rounds of ammunition and high - capacity magazines that allow a shooter to fire more rounds without stopping to reload			2
@entity6 ' lawyers called no witnesses during the hearing			1
scene : the movie theater where the massacre occurred another possibility in the case is that either side could argue that @entity6 is not mentally capable of assisting in his own defense			1
if that happens , the judge would order a mental competency evaluation			0
@entity20 also can order an evaluation if he has his own questions about @entity6 ' competence			2
in the case of the @entity149 , @entity150 , shooting that killed six people and wounded 13 , including then - rep. @entity152 , @entity153 was initially ruled incompetent to stand trial			0

if @entity6 ends up pleading not guilty by reason of insanity , @entity20 would also order a psychiatric evaluation by doctors at the state hospital			2
a jury would consider that evaluation , along with testimony by expert witnesses , any other court - ordered evaluations and other evidence , in deciding at a trial whether @entity6 is or is not guilty by reason of insanity			1
if found not guilty by reason of insanity , @entity6 would be committed to the state mental hospital for treatment			2
his case would be reviewed every six months			0
he conceivably could be released if he ever is deemed no longer insane			0
" insanity is what this case is going to turn on , " said @entity53 criminal defense attorney @entity176			0
" this is not a whodunit case			0
