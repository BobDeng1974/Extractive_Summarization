for all the facts and stats from the match at @entity3 go to our brilliant @entity4 no longer the circus clowns , @entity6 returned to @entity3 as the ringmaster running the show			1
@entity10 famously refused to accept the bit - part role here back in april , when @entity6 ’s 2 - 0 win at @entity3 derailed @entity15 ’s title ambitions			1
then , the @entity6 manager said he had the suspicion his team were being disregarded as something akin to a peripheral comic turn in @entity15 ’s prospective title celebration			1
he duly sent out an under - strength side to defend assiduously , won the game and hauled down @entity3 ’s @entity23			2

ratings by @entity82 at @entity3 but seven months on @entity6 are a different proposition			1
they are now the @entity87 ’s dominant force - 15 points clear of @entity15 now - while it is @entity24 who suddenly appears a little exposed			1
when last week he gambled by leaving seven players out at the @entity90 – all seven returned – he appeared to have escaped ignominy with an honourable 1 - 0 defeat			0
but on saturday , when he removed @entity48 and @entity34 on 70 minutes , boos resounded around @entity3			1
@entity24 has built up enough goodwill here to survive a brief outburst of frustration but perhaps a slither of belief has been eroded			0
but @entity10 was able to assume the role to which he is suited : that of dominant alpha male			0
‘ it was fantastic performance and an expression of ambition , ’ he said			0
‘ in the second half , against @entity15 , at @entity3 , every team accepts a point as a good result			1
' my team did n’t accept that , so the way they performed in the second half was an expression of that ambition and self - belief they have at the moment			0
sometimes you get points and you do n’t deserve but this is the case where the best team won			0
’ @entity36 did almost threw away their good work , leaning into a @entity45 shot on 87 minutes with his arm when , when , for the second time in the afternoon , he somehow managed to avoid conceding a penalty			1
referee @entity80 did not have one of his finest afternoons			0
in reality though , by that stage it was rare moment of un-ease for @entity6 even if it understandably irked @entity24			2
‘ it ’s bitterly disappointing for us , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s a big decision in a big game which we did n’t get and it was n’t even in doubt , it was a clear , clear handball and the referee had a clear look			0
my players gave everything today and if they were n’t going to get it from open play they certainly deserved it from the penalty spot			0
it is a difficult moment for us as we ’re not getting the results and it ’s been a tough week			0
’ yet even when @entity6 fell behind here - and how @entity3 roared when they did , hoping that the spirit of 2013 - 14 could be revived - you never felt that they had lost control of this game			1
@entity15 were a side seemingly always on the verge of a defensive breakdown , while their visitors appeared to be simply to biding their time to seize victory			2
@entity45 chases down @entity163 during the opening exchanges at @entity3 @entity50 ( on floor ) slides in and challenges @entity6 full back @entity60 can lets fly and his shot from 25 yards led to @entity15 's opening goal ( via a deflection ) can jumps for joy after scoring the opener - the midfielder 's first goal for @entity15 @entity34 's goal came after a 23 - pass move by @entity15 - click here for more from our brilliant @entity4 @entity36 ( centre ) shoots straight at @entity178 ( left ) but the ball went over the line for @entity6 's equaliser after 14 minutes the @entity6 centre half wheels away after scoring his side 's leveller at @entity3 the @entity185 showed that @entity36 's shot did cross the line @entity187 miles @entity15 111.5 69.2 @entity47 90 11.6 7.2 @entity45 90 11.1 6.9 @entity44 90 10.8 6.7 @entity6 109.7 68.2 @entity63 90 12.4 7.7 @entity75 90 11.8 7.4 @entity66 90 11.6 7.2 that said , it took time to achieve and that is to @entity15 ’s credit			1
they were better than they have been , especially in those opening exchanges , when they energy of their game did hark back to last season and temporarily disrupted @entity6 ’s progress			2
they started in a frenzy			0
@entity34 ’s first - minute shot was deflected wide by @entity61 but when he tried again on nine minutes , @entity36 got in the way and diverted it past his keeper and @entity3 once again roared with kind of belief that so energised the team last season			1
this being @entity6 though , they were not swept away by the whirlwind			2
@entity63 , who like @entity64 was playing with an injury which @entity10 said may cost them games later in the month , took the corner on 14 minutes which was met by @entity30 who flicked on for @entity61 to head from close range			1
@entity37 produced a superb reaction save and seemed to have done the same from @entity36 ’s scuffed shot from the rebound			1
but the goal - line technology showed the ball over the line			0
of course , it all occurred in front of the @entity227 , scene of @entity230 ’s ghost goal of folklore			0
this time , however , there was no debate			0
‘ everyone knows this is truth and that is fantastic for us as professional and for the crowd , as they know it ’s true , and for the referees , ’ said @entity10			0
the same could not be said for the contentious decisions that followed			0
@entity50 's mis - hit was stopped by the arm of a diving @entity36 on 26 minutes but referee @entity80 missed that and @entity44 ’s block with his arm on 36 minutes , another clear penalty of the three he should have awarded in the game			1
@entity51 has a word with @entity61 ( on floor ) following a challenge between the pair @entity61 ( second right ) heads the ball clear and relieves the pressure on the @entity6 defence @entity51 holds off @entity63 while @entity75 watches on keenly @entity64 puts his forearm into @entity50 's face - but it was the @entity15 man who was booked @entity42 ( left ) and @entity30 square up and the pair were at each other through the entire first half @entity42 ( second left ) is ushered away by @entity63 at half - time after another clash with @entity30 ( third right , partially obscured ) @entity44 ’s misdemeanour came within an extraordinary spell of @entity6 pressure in which @entity15 simply could not get out of their half			1
@entity274 reached a climax when @entity45 attempted to clear only to collide with @entity47 and @entity3 howled with indignation for , at the moment , it felt respite would never come			0
blocks from @entity41 - at least three – and @entity43 were responsible for holding @entity6 at bay			2
all the while , @entity30 and @entity42 were conducting a battle that appeared to be a cross between heavyweight boxing and hand - to - hand wrestling			2
if ever a team needed half time , it was @entity15			2
but they did emerge for the second half somewhat calmer			0
true they needed a @entity43 header to prevent @entity163 ’s lovely chipped pass reaching @entity30			2
but equally , when @entity50 cut inside @entity60 on 54 minutes , he forced a sharp save from @entity59			2
the breakthrough came on 66 minutes when @entity62 admirably refused to give up on a lost cause and – just – kept the ball in when chasing down the left wing			1
he then brushed @entity48 aside on his way to goal			0
@entity37 deflected his cross but only into the path of @entity30 who , inside the penalty area , finished as expected			1
@entity45 and @entity51 focused during the warm - up before the lunchtime clash against @entity6 @entity30 attempts an overhead kick as he has his short pulled by @entity15 defender @entity44 ( left ) @entity30 's shirt was ripped during one of his many battles with @entity15 's defenders @entity51 goes down under pressure from @entity75 and appeals to the referee as the ball squirts away @entity30 is congratulated by @entity65 after scoring @entity6 's second goal @entity15 felt the ball had gone out in the build - up to @entity6 's winner but the officials thought @entity62 kept it in @entity10 continues to have a vice-like grip on @entity15 after @entity30 scored the winner @entity51 takes off his gloves after being substituted following another ineffective display @entity30 , who wound up @entity15 's defenders all game , was booked for this challenge on @entity41 @entity36 appeared to move his arm towards the ball near the end but the referee did not give a penalty @entity45 appeals in vain to @entity80 for a penalty for handball - the referee was not interested four of @entity15 's returning players ( from left ) @entity51 , @entity50 , @entity48 and @entity47 warm - up			1

@entity34 put @entity15 ahead after nine minute with deflected shot
@entity36 equalised after 14 minutes after effort was given by @entity185
@entity30 rifled in @entity6 's second on 67 minutes after good work by @entity62
