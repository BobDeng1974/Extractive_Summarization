the source said : ' when she is making drinks and food that she has to drink or eat , they have a dump bucket that is brought out the second they cut			2
' ms @entity0 is then said to spit out the food , before filming resumes			1
a representative for ms @entity0 said she ' absolutely ' eats the food that she cooks but because of the number of times scenes that are shot , she does n't always ' eat and shallow every time ' the source explained that sometimes an assistant was used to ' take the bite ' of food if something needed to look like she had tried it , saying ' she does not eat at all while filming ' @entity61 , who represents ms @entity0 , called the claims ' absurd and completely false '			1
he said the chef ' absolutely ' eats her own food while filming but because scenes were often shot multiple times ' she does n't always eat and swallow every time '			2
