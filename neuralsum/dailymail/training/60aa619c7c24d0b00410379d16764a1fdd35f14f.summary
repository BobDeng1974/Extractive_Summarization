when 17 - year - old @entity4 saw 16 - year - old @entity5 ( now gutting ) at @entity6 in @entity7 , it was love at first sight			2
but the pair lost contact when @entity12 went home to @entity14 , and both went on to marry and raise families in different cities			1
memories : @entity19 and @entity20 walking north on @entity21 toward the @entity6 where they met in 1945 after a silence of 62 years , the pair got back in touch via email seven years ago and found the feelings they had for each other in 1945 were still there			1
both now in their 80s , the memories of that long - ago summer are still vivid for both of them			2
@entity19 , 85 , told @entity35 that when he saw pretty blond @entity12 , he had to go and ' chat her up			1
' ' i was excited , ' @entity12 , 84 , said			1
young love : this photo was taken shortly after @entity4 and @entity12 met at @entity6 ' here was this handsome guy who was interested in me , and i thought it would be fun			1
' the relationship turned serious and when @entity12 , returned home to @entity44 after spring break , @entity4 managed to scrounge rides from friends to visit her every weekend that summer			1
but when summer was over , @entity4 , still in high school , with no car , no money and having worn out his friends ' generosity , could n't visit his beloved @entity53 any more			2
' we were involuntarily separated , ' he told @entity35			0
' it could n’t be helped			0
' @entity55 - drenched summer : @entity12 , pictured left in both photos , never expected to fall in love on her spring break in 1945 for @entity12 , it was her first break - up , and she took it hard			1
' he broke my heart , ' she said , explaining how @entity4 sent a friend to collect his letterman 's jacket from her			0
@entity12 moved on , working as a flight attendant for @entity67 and marrying a man who was a passenger on one of her flights			1
she had four daughters , and when her husband died of a heart attack after 17 years of marriage , she raised them alone			0

@entity4 joined the @entity78 , went to @entity79 and became the manager of a lock - making company			0
he married twice , and his first marriage produced two daughters			0
back together : @entity12 and @entity4 now spend every holiday together and a week out of every month in 1990 , @entity4 retired to @entity6 , the town where he first laid eyes on @entity12			2
years passed , but both @entity4 and @entity12 occasionally found themselves remembering the sun - drenched summer when they were young and in love			1
' when one dates such a lovely girl , ' @entity4 told @entity35 , ' one remembers such things			0
' both treasured a small pile of photographs taken in 1945 when @entity53 , in a white bikini , and strapping 17 - year - old @entity96 would take beach trips and go on romantic dates			0
@entity12 told @entity35 how she would show a picture of @entity4 that she kept in her closet to her grown - up daughters			2
' there were many times over the years where i ’d think about my dear darling @entity53 , ' @entity4 said			0
despite the even greater distance between them since @entity12 's move to @entity75 , getting back in contact was a lot easier than it would have been in 1945			1
in 2007 , a mutual friend told @entity4 that he had spoken to @entity12 via email and discovered she would be flying to @entity6 for a friend 's birthday party			2
@entity4 needed no further encouragement and emailed @entity12 immediately			2
the pair struck up a correspondence , exchanging 62 years of news			1
he picked @entity12 up from the airport , wearing a red hat in honor of his teenage moniker , and the pair went to their old stomping ground at @entity127 for a long , conversation - filled dinner			2
62 years in the making : @entity12 and @entity4 have now been together again for seven years the chat that began again seven years ago never ended			1
now , the pair speak on the phone at 9am and 9pm each day and spend a week out of every month visiting each other , in addition to whiling away afternoons playing each other at online scrabble			0
they do n't plan to marry - @entity4 still lives in @entity6 and @entity12 remains in @entity75 , close to her daughters - but the arrangement works for both of them			1
' this works out for us quite well , ' @entity4 told @entity35			0
' we are so different that if we were together all the time , i think we ’d drive each other crazy			0
the couple spend holidays together , and their families have gotten to know each other and are ecstatic that @entity12 and @entity4 have found love again			1
' we ’re in love , ' @entity4 affirms			0
' sometimes i wonder about what would have happened if we ’d stayed together back then			0
i think we both feel it could ’ve ended in marriage			0
but it does n’t do much good now to talk about " what if ? " the future is out there , and we ’ll face it together			0
