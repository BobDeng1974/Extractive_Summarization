@entity0 was reported to the council by a passer - by after being seen standing on a chair to hang fairy lights when a string of decorative fairy lights came loose outside his restaurant , @entity0 stood on a chair and hooked them back in place with a broom			1
the 25 - second task was soon forgotten – but not by health and safety zealots at the local council			1
a passer - by reported what had happened to officials , and mr @entity0 received a call four days later from an environmental health officer who announced that the case was under investigation			1
during the ticking off he was warned that he could face further action for supposedly putting himself at risk by hanging the lights 12ft off the ground			2
he was also told he should have used correct climbing apparatus , namely an ‘ aluminium construction secured at three points ’ – council jargon for a ladder			1
yesterday the married father - of - one attacked the waste of taxpayers ’ money , saying : ‘ this really is barmy @entity37 bureaucracy			1
‘ i thought it was a prank call so i do n’t think i was very co-operative with the officer			0
i was asking if i should have requested permission to have the high street closed and perhaps made sure that @entity42 were on standby			0
’ he added : ‘ it really is a case of health and safety gone mad			0
we have to have some common sense in this life – the council can not nanny everyone			2
’ mr @entity0 , who owns the @entity53 @entity52 restaurant in @entity54 , @entity55 , saw the lights had come loose during high winds on the afternoon of @entity58			1
the street was virtually deserted at the time so there was no risk of anyone knocking him , and the seat of the chair was only around 18 inches away from the ground			2
he said : ‘ it could not have taken more than 25 seconds to sort out , it really was that quick			0
the chair is very solid and i feel safer standing on it than i do on a ladder			0
’ a council spokesman said : ‘ following a complaint from a member of the public about unsafe working practices , an environmental health officer phoned the business to establish if there was any truth to the allegation			0
' the officer discussed working at height and advised that appropriate equipment should be used			0
the council is not proposing to take any further action			0
’ the father - of - one , who owns @entity53 @entity52 restaurant in @entity54 , @entity55 , said the incident was a waste of taxpayers ' money			1
