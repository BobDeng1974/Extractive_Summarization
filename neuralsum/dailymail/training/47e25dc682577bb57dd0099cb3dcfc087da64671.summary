@entity0 looked dead on his feet			1
the first @entity3 substitution had been made and more than a few were surprised it had not been his number called			1
not that he was playing badly			0
he had been quite , quite brilliant , but had run himself into the ground keeping the champions quiet			0
all of @entity3 ’s midfield were relentless in their commitment to this cause			1
still , there was a free - kick to be taken and @entity0 is @entity3 ’s free - kick taker			1
he chipped a curling ball into the @entity17 area , where @entity18 outran , outthought and outmuscled @entity19 to apply a delightfully weighted glancing header			1
two goals clear , the game was won			0
@entity18 ( right ) nods the ball past @entity21 in the @entity17 goal to double @entity3 's advantage @entity21 can only look back in anger as the ball nestles in his net and @entity3 head off in celebration at scoring a second goal @entity18 salutes the crowd after heading home for @entity3 to set the @entity33 firmly on their way to a rare victory in @entity36 @entity18 slides in jubilant celebration and is joined by @entity3 team - mate @entity38 as they head towards a crucial three points @entity17 : @entity21 6 , @entity41 5.5 , @entity42 5 , @entity43 5 , @entity44 6 , @entity45 4 , ( @entity46 63 , 6 ) , @entity19 4 , @entity47 5 ( @entity48 76 , 6 ) , @entity49 5.5 , @entity50 6 ( @entity51 46 , 6 ) , @entity52 4.5			1

the best @entity3 performance of recent years ? quite possibly			1
certainly it is hard to recall a more effective one			0
@entity0 was magnificent , the man of the match			2
close behind him was @entity65 , a wonderfully effective destroyer in central midfield			0
@entity63 was outstanding in the heart of defence , but a back four that included @entity64 and @entity61 barely wavered			2
before the game all the talk was of @entity38 , the one that got away , considering he shares his @entity101 nationality with city manager @entity59			2
yet it was @entity3 ’s humble foot soldiers who were the heroes here			2
@entity52 was smothered , so too @entity49			0
the supply line was cut and @entity17 looked insipid			2
there was no - one with the drive of @entity107 , reduced to tweeting good luck messages from @entity109 , and even @entity46 had no impact from the bench			0
while the second - half performance was an improvement on the first , by the end city were reduced to pumping high balls to @entity48			2
by then , @entity3 were too practised at containment to be worried			2
they cantered towards the conclusion , deserved winners			0
@entity119 and fourth place are very much in their sights			1
@entity0 fired home the opening goal from the penalty spot as he sent the ball past the outstretched arms of keeper @entity21 @entity64 hits the brick wall of @entity42 as he attempts to get on the end of a ball into the @entity17 box @entity64 was caught by @entity42 with the contact sending the left back crashing to the ground inside the penalty box @entity64 's fall handed @entity3 the perfect opportunity to go in front at the @entity139 and @entity0 did not waste his opportunity @entity17 captain argues his case with referee @entity80 after conceding the first - half penalty at the @entity139 @entity0 leads the @entity3 celebrations after the @entity145 kept his cool to fire home from the penalty spot @entity0 is joined in his celebration by striker @entity18 who would go on to double the visitors ' advantage in the second half this was a huge result , not just for @entity3 , but for @entity155 football			1
@entity156 have not just gained an extra three points , but seven goals at the top of the table			1
add their 5 - 0 win at @entity162 to @entity17 ’s 2 - 0 defeat and this is the biggest weekend of the season so far			1
@entity156 face @entity17 at home on january 31 , their next league game			1
win that and they can begin planning the parade			0
if @entity17 do not bounce back speedily from this , or find a way to cover @entity107 ’s stint with @entity174 at the @entity175 , the title race could be over sooner than many imagined			2
that @entity177 has been aided by @entity3 ’s ‘ specialist in failure ’ @entity78 is an irony that should not be lost on him			2
this was a @entity78 team few expect to see , an @entity3 with guts and resilience			2
so many of the qualities it has been felt @entity3 lack were present in this game			2
this was an @entity3 that stuck at it , that grafted , that played @entity17 on the counter-attack , that soaked it up , that were tenacious , determined , superb without the ball			1
and yet they had the best chances , too			0
@entity3 in possession were quick and had purpose			2
city were ponderous , hesitant			0
a first - timer , told that one of these teams was chasing the league leaders would have instantly plumped for the band in yellow			0
they may not have seen as much of the ball but , when they did get it , they knew what to do			0
@entity42 fouls @entity18 and is then shown the yellow card as @entity17 fought to get back into the game at the @entity139 @entity3 midfielder @entity66 clashes with @entity17 's @entity52 as they vie for possession during the if the criticism is that @entity3 can not play a clever , containing game on the break , here was @entity78 ’s eloquent response			1
at times in the first half @entity3 ’s possession statistic dropped as low as 21 per cent , yet they look dangerous with the ball , goalkeeper @entity60 did not have a save of consequence to make until the 47th minute , and the midfield worked devilishly hard at making @entity17 ’s forwards look pedestrian			1
it was a performance that left the locals noisily frustrated			0
by half - time they were in a snit with their team , and @entity80 the referee , news clearly having reached the @entity139 of the contentious nature of @entity3 ’s lead			1
it was a minute from hell for @entity17 captain @entity42			1
he brought the ball out from the back , seemed uncertain what to do with it , kicked the floor as he made his mind up , then fell over			0
( this is perhaps why you do n’t give your @entity248 votes to tenacious , robust defensive types			0
) soon after he was shaping up to @entity3 ’s @entity251 , who slipped the ball inside and ran for the one - two			1
@entity42 did n’t stick a foot out , but he did n’t entirely avoid contact either			2
he stood his ground — as is his right — but with the tiniest movement to slow @entity64 ’s path			2
the pair made minimal contact but it was enough for @entity64 to throw himself to the ground , and @entity80 bought it			0
he pointed to the spot to @entity42 ’s astonishment , and @entity0 planted the ball to @entity21 ’s left , leaving him no chance			1
@entity52 , @entity269 and @entity46 look dejected as @entity17 head for a crushing defeat by @entity3 @entity0 crashes into @entity272 striker @entity52 and concedes the foul , earning himself a booking in the process @entity78 appeals to the officials during a 2 - 0 win at @entity17 as his @entity3 side prevailed at the @entity139 @entity3 's @entity68 evades the attention of @entity17 pair @entity47 ( right ) and @entity19 ( left ) @entity52 watches on as he narrowly misses out on connecting with a cross in front of @entity3 's goal during the 2 - 0 defeat @entity49 was well marked all match by a resilient @entity3 midfield , as @entity65 slides in to stop the @entity145 on this occasion @entity17 ’s initial response was innocuous			1
indeed , the only chance worth a shout before @entity59 regrouped at half - time fell to @entity3			1
an @entity66 cross after 19 minutes was deflected wide by @entity42 after @entity18 ’s header			1
of course , they could n’t be as poor in the second half and so it proved			0
having not had a shot inside 36 minutes , they applied real pressure after the restart			0
@entity60 — again included ahead of @entity72 but hardly inspiring greater confidence — tipped round from @entity52 , perhaps unnecessarily , and a fierce effort from @entity47 was parried moments later			0
but @entity3 always looked more likely to score , thanks to resolute defending and the uncertainty of a @entity17 back line that has now conceded more league goals than @entity119 this season			1
the visitors could have been two clear even earlier after a fine move involving @entity38 and @entity18 ended with @entity68 spare on the left but shooting over			0
soon after , a quite brilliant touch by @entity63 denied @entity52 again , following a cross from @entity311 , but this was @entity3 at their finest this season			0
not always beautiful , but intelligent and efficient , with a strength that had been presumed beyond them			0
no one was jeering @entity78 as he made his way back to @entity317 this time			0
@entity3 keeper @entity60 celebrates the morale boosting victory at the @entity139 with @entity33 skipper per mertesacker goalscorer @entity18 salutes the travelling @entity3 fans after his header guided @entity78 's side to a crucial win on sunday the @entity3 squad head over to the away end to applaud the travelling @entity3 fans who celebrated a fine victory for the @entity33			1

@entity3 took the lead through @entity0 's penalty after @entity64 was fouled by @entity42
@entity18 headed home the crucial second goal in the second half to ensure a vital three points
@entity3 have closed the gap on fourth - placed @entity119 to one point in the @entity340 table
but @entity17 now trail @entity156 with five points after a *disastrous* weekend for @entity59
