some wear gps devices that are constantly monitored by police			0
others have fled their homes ; repudiated by the local community for being a registered sex offender			1

welcome to @entity15 , a tiny church town spanning about 20 acres on the edge of @entity17 in south @entity18 , which was established in 2009 as a spiritual safe haven for sex offenders and their families			1
with a population of about 200 , it is believed to be the largest sex offender community in the @entity26			0
he spent three days taking pictures and talking with the residents who gave him permission			0
' there are no violent criminals in the town , [ which is ] a strict guideline to admission , ' @entity60 told @entity76			0
' it is a deeply religious , tight knit and strictly self - governed community			1
' ' i wanted to treat the offenders and non-offenders in the same manner and instead think about the town as an example of a self - governed community built around common experience , whatever that might be			1
' while the town looks and sounds like a colony of outcasts with no other option , it is actually a highly sought - after place to live			2
finding housing as a sex offender in @entity18 is almost impossible , with state laws forbidding them to go within 1,000 feet of schools , playgrounds , parks or any other place there might be children			1
different cities and counties have increased that distance to 2,500 , or half a mile			0
additionally , a lot of offenders come out of prison with little to no money			0
' application numbers are very high and admission , based on a voting system , is very selective , ' @entity60 said			2
' moral and ethical judgments aside , the residents are trying to live out their @entity113 , in the only way the law and society will allow			0
' some discuss their hopes for life after their time in @entity15 , but many find it to be a safe place and wish to stay			1
' post-prison : the bungalow community offers sex offenders a place to live with their families without judgement unbiased : photographer @entity60 said he aimed to document a community that was self - governed , not what brought the people there home : the residents of @entity15 greatly vary in both age and circumstance studies : @entity15 offers classes , such as sexual purity and anger management , as well as psychological treatment programs photographer @entity60 spent three days in the village , photographing those who gave permission to do so familial : a few children do live at @entity15			1
@entity18 's laws do n't stop sex offenders from living in the same neighbourhood as minors , but probation conditions often prevent them having any contact with them shunned : most of the people who live in the colony have been turned away from their homes following their convictions regular meetings : there are classes available that give counsel for sexual purity , anger management and other issues self - governed : while all the villagers chip in to help , such as maintaining the grounds , some have jobs in nearby towns simple : all the homes are more or less the same size and style distance : surround by sugarcane fields , farmers in the background can be seen burning off the extraneous leaves around their crop farmland : @entity15 looks an island in the middle of a sugarcane oasis @entity15 was set up by the late evangelical pastor @entity38 , according to @entity184			1
@entity38 came close to being charged with statutory rape as a 18 - year - old after getting his 14 - year - old girlfriend pregnant			2
he would teach a sexual purity to those living there each week			0
there are also anger management and bible study classes			0
most of the sex offenders are required to attended psychological treatment programs as part of the conidtions of their probation			2
others have jobs in the surrounding towns , the nearest of which is two miles away			0
many nearby residents relocated after @entity15 was founded , and a bus stop that was out front of the village entrance was moved so no children would come near the community			2
modest : almost all the bungalow - style houses date back to the 1960 's , when the tiny town was first built rudimentary : a self - made clothesline pictured at @entity15 in south @entity18 commonality : everyone in the religious community know each other and often socialize together going about their lives : half of the residents are registered sex offenders , while the other half are spouses and family members supportive : the people work together to manage the grounds and help each other roots : the village was built on religion and centered around the church			1

@entity15 , just outside @entity17 in south @entity18 , was established in 2009 by the late evangelical pastor @entity38
borne out of religion , it is place where registered sex offenders can live without judgement and repent their sins
many offenders find it near impossible to find housing in @entity18 , where they are not permitted to come within 1,000 feet of children
@entity61 - based photographer @entity60 spent three days in the village capturing the people who live there
@entity60 says he was more *interested* in capturing a self - governed society , rather than what had brought them together
