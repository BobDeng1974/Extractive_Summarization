@entity0 would be boasting @entity1 in their ranks for tuesday 's last chance saloon against @entity4 had the club not pulled the plug on a deal three years ago			1
@entity1 , then at @entity8 , was subject of a £ 17.5million offer from the @entity11 champions , with @entity12 going in the opposite direction			1
but according to his former boss @entity14 , @entity0 opted against spending that much on the central defender , who @entity17 then went on to sign for half the price			1
@entity1 was very close to signing for @entity0 for around £ 17.5million three years ago former @entity8 manager @entity14 asserts that @entity0 pulled the plug on any deal for the defender it now appears a galling oversight given the defensive problems taking hold at the @entity26 and @entity1 's rise to prominence			1
neither @entity29 or @entity30 look to be capable of performing dependably at the very top , while captain @entity32 has n't been exempt from criticism this season			0
cahill , @entity14 asserts , would have been a perfect fit in @entity36			1
' he has everything , ' he told @entity38			0
' in terms of skills as a footballer , he has pace , power , he has two great feet			0
and with being a top class defender , he weighs in goals as well			0
' @entity1 has become a mainstay alongside @entity46 for the @entity47 and is @entity49 's most consistent centre - half under @entity50			2
the 28 - year - old , however , was ready to seal a move to @entity54 's side until the late change of heart			0
@entity49 international @entity1 is now a rock alongside @entity46 in @entity17 's settled back four it is n't the first time @entity14 has decided to pinpoint @entity0 's missed opportunity			1
' the summer before he moved to @entity17 , @entity0 came in and offered £ 17 million and a player			1
that was going to be a huge deal			2
obviously , something happened , so he stayed on at @entity8 and it never materialised , ' he said in march			0
' come the following january in 2012 , when it was @entity17 who came in , it was the right thing for him , no doubt			2
' they got absolutely got a bargain at £ 7million			0
we were at the wrong end of the table and caught up in a battle but i 'd always said we would do right by him and give him his chance			0
