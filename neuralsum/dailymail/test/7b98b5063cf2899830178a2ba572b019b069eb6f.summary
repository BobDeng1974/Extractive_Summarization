' the kind of cancer i had - despite it being in my cervix - would not have showed up on a smear test			1
' so it 's important to visit your gp if you 're concerned about anything , as well as always going for routine tests			0
' ms @entity8 , an education consultant , began experiencing odd symptoms in 2009 , when she flew to @entity30 to volunteer at a lion research centre for a month			1
a week before she was due to fly home she fell violently ill with stomach cramps			2
she spent seven days in hospital where a local doctor told her that she was suffering with a cyst on her ovaries that had burst			2
leiomyosarcomas are cancers that develop in a type of muscle tissue called smooth muscle			2
these muscles are found in the walls of muscular organs like the heart and the stomach			0
they are rare and usually only affect people over the age of 50 , but they can start anywhere in the body			2
they most commonly start in the walls of the womb , the limbs and the digestive system			0

when she returned , she went for a routine smear test in 2011 and was given the all clear			0
ever since being hospitalised in @entity30 she had experienced spotting in between her periods , longer periods than normal and stomach cramps			0
by last summer these symptoms had become worse and intense pain and lots of bleeding			0
her gp suggested it was a hormonal problem and that she go on the contraceptive pill to try and control it			0
but as she was single , ms @entity8 did n't see the point of using a contraceptive and felt uneasy about taking hormonal treatment			1
she also did n't want to ignore the signals her body was giving her , and so never took the contraceptives that were prescribed			0
it was only in january this year , when she was called for her next smear test , that she was finally diagnosed			0
the nurse due to carry out the smear said her cervix was so irritated that it was impossible to conduct the test			1
ms @entity8 , pictured in 2009 , became aware something was seriously wrong when a nurse could n't perform a smear test on her as there was so much inflammation doctors diagnosed ms @entity8 with a leiomyosarcoma - a cancer of the soft tissue , the muscle , fat , blood vessels , or any of the other tissues that support , surround and protect the organs of the body she then broke the devastating news that she suspected ms @entity8 had cancer			1
after an mri scan , doctors confirmed she had leiomyosarcoma and would need a hysterectomy to save her life			1

ms @entity8 described the shock of being told she may never be able to become pregnant naturally			1
' this was going to be the year i was going to go out and meet someone and start to think about having a family			0
' but now i would n't be able to carry a child			0
' i could n't believe that i had cancer in my cervix for all that time			2
' ms @entity8 underwent a hysterectomy at just 34 - and was devastated at the thought of not being able to carry a child			1
but she remained positive , saying ' there is somebody else going through much worse ' she underwent egg collection so that one day she might have a child that is biologically hers			0
on march 19th this year she underwent the operation to remove her womb – and the tumour – and is now recovering at home			0
while many women would become disheartened after such an ordeal , ms @entity8 said she believes she said : ' luckily i am a naturally positive person , and i just think that there is somebody else going through something much worse than me			2
' when i was finally diagnosed it was more of a relief than anything to know what was wrong			0
' it was when i was told that i would need a hysterectomy that when it hit me , and i became really upset			2
' even before she had cancer , ms @entity8 ran the @entity196 for @entity197 , and this year raising money for the charity will be more meaningful than ever			1
