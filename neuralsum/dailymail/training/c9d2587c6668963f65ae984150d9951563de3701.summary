@entity2 is running for president , @entity1 host @entity0 declared tuesday night on @entity4 , and the former secretary of state played along – even saying she prefers a ' home office ' with ' fewer corners ' than usual			1
@entity9 presidents work in the famed @entity10 , a @entity12 room with no corners			2
speculation about the potential for a 2016 @entity17 run has consumed @entity9 's political chattering classes since she resigned from president @entity21 's cabinet early in 2013			1
@entity23 , less comfortable questions may intrude into the discussion , however , since questions and answers between @entity0 and @entity27 about the @entity28 were left on the cutting room floor			1
as @entity0 held @entity27 's book sideways to show the cameras its heft , @entity2 quipped that it represented ' a lot of hard choices			1
' ' not for your editor			0
' a playful @entity0 shot back			2
@entity27 later said she ' put my heart and soul into ' the book			1
but reports have swirled around @entity65 , including one from famed @entity67 reporter and former @entity69 journalist @entity68 , that a ghostwriter did most of the heavy lifting			0
@entity73 historian @entity72 , according to @entity68 , wrote the book			0
historian @entity72 , a onetime @entity27 speechwriter , is reportedly the true author of ' @entity44 ' he was a speechwriter near the end of the @entity77 years , and conducted many of the interviews that formed the basis for the former president 's own memoir , ' my life			1
' the @entity1 interview , broadcast in two segments , was marred by a pair of abrupt cuts			0
an @entity89 report suggests what was left out			0
@entity27 and @entity0 , the @entity89 writes , ' moved on to a series of national and international issues @entity27 faced as secretary of state , including the violence and tension between @entity96 and the @entity97			1
' ' " we 're really in a terrible dilemma , " she said , noting there has been an offer of a cease - fire brokered by @entity102 that @entity96 accepted but that was rejected by @entity103 , which controls the @entity104			1
' ' part of what i see @entity103 doing is , their identity comes from being the violent resistance , ' @entity27 said , according to the @entity89 report written between the taping and when the show aired			1
but @entity2 's time in the @entity117 and her book - length retelling of it necessarily took a back seat on tuesday , even as images of the ' @entity44 ' cover danced on tv monitors in @entity0 's @entity124 studio			2
it 's ' incredibly complex and well - reasoned , ' he said			2
' and i think i speak for everyone when i say no one cares			0
they just want to know if you 're running for president			2
' not so hard : @entity27 told @entity0 she ' put my heart and soul into ' her memoir , ' @entity44 , ' although ghostwriter @entity72 reportedly produced the manuscript @entity2 laughed : ' i was going to make an announcement , but you kind of spoiled it for me			1
so i 'm just going to have to reconsider			0
' the studio audience 's earlier cheers had already betrayed their enthusiasm for a @entity27 2016 ticket , cheers that continued as a half - joking @entity0 seemed to paint her into a corner with a series of questions culled from a high - school career aptitude test			1
' do you like commuting to work , or do you like a home office ? ' he asked			0
' i 've spent so many years commuting that i kinda prefer a home office , ' @entity2 replied			0
' that 's where i wrote my book			0
' as anticipation ratcheted up , @entity0 uncorked the next gag			0
' do you have a favorite shape for that home office ? would you like that office to have corners ? ' he grinned			0
' you know , ' @entity27 replied knowingly , ' i think the world is so complicated , the fewer corners that you have – ' the audience 's wild cheers drowned out the rest of her sentence			2
it 's ' incredibly complex and well - reasoned , ' the comedian @entity0 said of @entity27 's memoir , ' and i think i speak for everyone when i say no one cares : they just want to know if you 're running for president ' other questions were more serious , drawing answers from @entity27 that will seem familiar to @entity177 who are critical of @entity21 's ' pen and phone ' approach to working around @entity181			1
asked whether ' the bureaucracy of government [ has ] become unmanageable , ' @entity27 replied that @entity9 has ' a @entity181 that is no longer functioning effectively			2
' she added that presidents face ' a very difficult situation in our executive branch because ... it has not kept up with the times			0
we do n't have the kind of agility and flexibility ' other nations enjoy			0
her statement seemed to be a veiled reply to @entity177 critics of @entity21 's many end - runs around the @entity177 - controlled @entity198 , including immigration deportation waivers and numerous unilateral tweaks to the @entity201			1
' we need comprehensive immigration reform , ' @entity27 said as one reason the @entity12 should have more power .			1

@entity27 told host @entity0 that she ' put my heart and soul into ' her memoir , despite *widespread* reports that it was ghost - written for her
but ' no one cares ' about the book , said @entity0 : ' they just want to know if you 're running for president '
@entity27 *complained* that the presidency lacks enough ' flexibility ' – a *nod* of approval to @entity21 's *sweeping* executive orders – and *insisted* that @entity9 needs ' comprehensive immigration reform '
show taping included questions and answers about @entity103 and the @entity232 - @entity96 *conflict* that were cut out of the broadcast
