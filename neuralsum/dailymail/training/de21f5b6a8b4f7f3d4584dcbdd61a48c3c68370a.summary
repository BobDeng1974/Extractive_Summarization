by @entity0 and @entity1 the @entity2 has told wireless streaming firm @entity3 it must pay broadcasters when it takes television programs from the airwaves and allows subscribers to watch them on phones and tablets			1
the justices said by a 6 - 3 vote that @entity3 is violating the broadcasters ' copyrights by taking the signals for free			1
the ruling is expected to kill the service , which is available in @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 among 11 metropolitan areas and uses thousands of dime - size antennas to capture television signals and transmit them to subscribers who pay as little as $ 8 a month for the service			1
the @entity2 has ruled that @entity3 has to pay broadcasters when it takes television programs from the airwaves @entity3 is s available in @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 among 11 metropolitan areas and uses thousands of dime - size antennas to capture television signals and transmit them to subscribers who pay as little as $ 8 a month for the service			1
the ruling preserves the ability of the television networks to collect huge fees from cable and satellite systems that transmit their programming			2
@entity3 looks a lot like a cable system , justice @entity51 wrote for the court in rejecting the company 's attempts to distinguish itself from cable and satellite tv			2
' @entity3 's system is , for all practical purposes , identical to a cable system , ' he said			0
company executives have said their business model would not survive a loss at the @entity2			0
following the ruling , billionaire @entity63 , @entity3 's most prominent investor , said , ' it 's not a big ( financial ) loss for us , but i do believe blocking this technology is a big loss for consumers , and beyond that i only salute ( @entity3 ceo ) @entity75 and his band of @entity77 for fighting the good fight			1
' some justices worried during arguments in april that a ruling for the broadcasters could also harm the burgeoning world of cloud computing , which gives users access to a vast online computer network that stores and processes information			1
but @entity51 said the court did not intend to call cloud computing into question			0
justices @entity92 , @entity94 and @entity95 dissented			0
@entity92 said he shares the majority 's feeling that what @entity3 is doing " ought not to be allowed			0
" but he said the court has distorted federal copyright law to forbid it			0
@entity101 should decide whether the law " needs an upgrade , " @entity92 said			0
broadcasters including @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity32 sued @entity3 for copyright infringement , saying @entity3 should pay for redistributing the programming in the same way cable and satellite systems must or risk high - profile blackouts of channels that anger their subscribers			1
the @entity117 praised the court for rejecting @entity3 's argument that the lawsuit was an attack on innovation			0
' broadcasters embrace innovation every day , as evidenced by our leadership in hdtv , social media , mobile apps , user - generated content , along with network tv backed ventures like @entity134 , ' @entity117 president @entity123 said			0
in each market , @entity3 has a data center with thousands of dime - size antennas			2
when a subscriber wants to watch a show live or record it , the company temporarily assigns the customer an antenna and transmits the program over the internet to the subscriber 's laptop , tablet , smartphone or even a big - screen tv with a @entity151 or @entity152 streaming device			0
the antenna is only used by one subscriber at a time , and @entity3 says that 's much like the situation at home , where a viewer uses a personal antenna to watch over-the - air broadcasts for free			2
the broadcasters and professional sports leagues also feared that nothing in the case would limit @entity3 to local service			1
@entity165 and the @entity166 have lucrative contracts with the television networks and closely guard the airing of their games			0
@entity3 's model would pose a threat if , say , a consumer in @entity19 could watch @entity166 games from anywhere through his @entity3 subscription			1
the federal appeals court in @entity19 ruled that @entity3 did not violate the copyrights of broadcasters with its service , but a similar service has been blocked by judges in @entity183 and @entity184 @entity75 , founder and ceo of @entity186 , holding a tablet displaying his company 's technology , in @entity19			1
the 2nd @entity191 @entity190 said its ruling stemmed from a 2008 decision in which it held that @entity195 could offer a remote digital video recording service without paying additional licensing fees to broadcasters because each playback transmission was made to a single subscriber using a single unique copy produced by that subscriber			2
the @entity2 declined to hear the appeal from movie studios , tv networks and cable tv channels			0
in the @entity3 case , a dissenting judge said his court 's decision would eviscerate copyright law			0
judge @entity212 called @entity3 's setup a sham and said the individual antennas are a " @entity217 - like contrivance " — an overly complicated device that accomplishes a simple task in a confusing way — that exists for the sole purpose of evading copyright law			2
smaller cable companies , independent broadcasters and consumer groups backed @entity3 , warning the court not to try to predict the future of television			1
indeed , @entity92 himself noted that the high court came within a vote of declaring videocassette recorders " contraband " when it ruled for @entity234 in a case over recordings of television programs 30 years ago .			1
