by @entity0 published : 11:14 est , 13 may 2013 updated : 13:33 est , 13 may 2013 it ’s shaping up to be the most exciting @entity2 yet			0
and now , @entity3 have released some new screens showing off @entity2 : blacklist ’s multiplayer			0
although most details are being kept secret , the famed @entity8 mode is set to make a return			1
players will be able to face off in teams of four and create their very own spy or @entity14 according to their playstyles via a host of customisable elements			1
spy hunters : most multiplayer details are being kept under wraps , but @entity8 is a wonderful addition the original @entity22 vs. @entity8 experience also makes its long awaited comeback			2
interestingly , whereas @entity27 ’s co-operative felt slightly disjointed from the main narrative , @entity6 's new @entity25 allows a much more connected experience			0
the @entity25 allows 4th @entity30 to receive data about mission objectives while on the move			0
players can take advantage of the universal game economy system to customise and upgrade @entity37 , his suit , goggles and weapons in single player			1
while in multiplayer , @entity37 and @entity42 can earn in - game currency and unlock additional weapons or gadgets via specialized missions assigned by @entity48 , @entity42 , @entity49 and @entity50			2
visually , the game is reportedly using the same @entity53 engine that powered conviction - essentially a modified version of @entity55			1
there 's no word yet on whether lead is cross generational , although blacklist has not been slated as a next - gen release			1
the game 's length , too , has not been discussed - with criticisms of @entity27 centering around the its short playtime			2
it takes two to tango : co-operative has been tweaked and improved to make use of the new @entity25 mechanic there are also reports that the game 's dynamic ' torture ' mechanic - used sparingly in @entity27 - has been overhauled and features more prominently			1
it ’s set for release on august 20			0
follow us on @entity75 : @ @entity76 and on @entity77 : @entity78 .			0
