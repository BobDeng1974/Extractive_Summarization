@entity9 's lawyers said that bringing the same case against him twice was an abuse of process			2

@entity49 , representing the @entity12 authorities , told the court that the @entity51 had made a ' comical series of blunders ' in relation to the @entity56 's extradition but argued that they do not amount to an abuse of process and should not stop the extradition going ahead			2
the mistakes included serving legal papers late to @entity9 's lawyers ahead of an appeal at the @entity63 and failing to inform counsel that a new assurance had been given by the @entity12 authorities regarding the prison he would be sent to if extradited			1
' it is unfortunate that due to human error the process has not flowed as smoothly as it should have , but we say that to say that there has been an abuse of process is a quantum leap too far , ' mr @entity67 said			0

@entity9 has previously been described as ' one of the heads of one of the most powerful mafia associations in @entity12 ' ' one time in the middle of the night he woke me up and asked me who i was talking to			1
' he has discussed this with the doctor because his mental state is quite worrying for all of us			0
' he often seems quite confused and sits quietly with his hands on his head looking into space			0
' mrs @entity82 said the family had been ' shocked ' by her husband 's second arrest , which she said took place in front of an 11 - year - old relative			1
she also said her husband is ' concerned ' about what would happen to his family if he were to be sent back to @entity12			2
' it is not only his health , he is worried about the family because he would be in @entity12 and we would be here and that has a great influence on his mental state , ' she said			0
judge @entity32 told @entity9 that he was bailing him to appear for another short hearing on october 21 , when the court is expected to hear from an expert for the defence on prison conditions in @entity12			1
