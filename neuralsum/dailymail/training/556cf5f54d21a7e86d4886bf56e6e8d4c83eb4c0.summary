@entity0 is tired because of the pressure of trying to fill @entity3 's boots at @entity4 ... not playing for @entity5 true measure of a top coach like @entity8 or @entity9 is to find a lower - league gem and make him into a world beater like @entity13 or @entity14 @entity15 and @entity16 have a telepathic understanding that gives @entity5 a fighting chance at @entity19 if @entity20 leaves @entity21 for @entity22 then he ’s a bottle job			1
@entity20 seems to have achieved the impossible by joining a top club , winning a @entity25 , then seeing his market value slide dramatically			1
that ’s a hell of an effort			2
is it all his fault ? probably not , although he has done nothing to address how lightweight he is			0
he is quite literally a pushover in the @entity33			1
not all small players are so easily shoved aside – look at @entity35			0
but others do n’t help him			0
the apologists among the @entity21 fans who talk about secondary assists , and @entity20 ’s so - called brilliant pass earlier in the move – these people are making stuff up to try to make him look better than he is			1
just tell the truth chaps – he ’s been a massive disappointment			0
he ’s a big player who should be having a direct impact on games			0
@entity20 has been linked with a move to @entity22 after just over a year at @entity21 @entity20 , brought to his knees against @entity53 , has been accused of being too lightweight for the @entity33 @entity54 says you need to watch him for 90 minutes in the flesh to properly make a judgement			1
well i have done – on more than one occasion this season – and he ’s still lightweight with minimal contribution			0
i also saw a manager who refused to substitute a player who was having little or no impact on the game			0
stubbornness or stupidity ? you decide			0
and then we come to how @entity54 uses @entity20			1
he puts him out wide			0
most @entity21 fans will tell you his best position is in the no 10 role behind @entity75			1
they do n’t get paid £ 8m a year so how come he ca n’t see it , and when he has played the @entity79 man there how come it does n’t work as effectively and regularly as it should ? @entity54 says you need to watch @entity20 for 90 minutes to see his full contribution - and it 's still not great @entity35 , in action against @entity86 , is a small player but is not considered a push - over , unlike @entity20 it ’s easy for opponents to bully @entity20			1
there is no @entity91 or @entity92 at @entity21 these days – nobody to protect a player like him			2
that 's a massive oversight from @entity54 , whose squad - building powers are at their weakest right now			2
but at the end of the analysis and debate about @entity20 you have to look at the player himself			2
has he done enough ? has he made himself ready for the @entity33 ? has he adapted to the pace and power of the game ? has he shown any signs of addressing why he has such little direct impact on games ? @entity92 and @entity91 would have been able to protect @entity20 when they were playing the xbox managers will throw in their stats about assists here , but i ’m talking about coming away from a game and thinking : ‘ @entity20 was head and shoulders above everyone else on the pitch , that ’s why he cost £ 42.5m			1
’ how many times have you done that ? blame @entity54 , blame the apologists , blame his team - mates – blame whoever			2
ultimately the player has got to look at himself			0
if he slips off to @entity22 for a cut - price fee can he honestly look at himself in the mirror and say he did his best for @entity21 ? of course not .			1

@entity20 has been linked with a move to @entity22
@entity20 cost @entity21 £ 42.5m but has not always lived up to his price tag
the @entity79 is too much of a push - over in the @entity33
@entity20 is currently *injured* for @entity21 after being ruled out until the new year with knee *ligament* damage
