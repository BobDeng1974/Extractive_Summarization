join us in our campaign to say ' @entity2 ' to players and referees			0
we ’ll be naming and shaming the cheats and the officials who let them get away with it			0
@entity16 has been caught as the latest culprit of @entity18 's ' @entity20 ' campaign , when he was seen grappling in the penalty area with @entity12 ’s @entity11 as the @entity14 champions stuttered at the @entity15			1
the £ 32million summer signing from @entity22 has struggled to find his feet in @entity24 and had his hands all over @entity11 from a corner			0
@entity16 manhandled the 23 - year - old in the first half , but referee @entity29 was unmoved			2
it appeared blatant after television replays , although @entity11 was able to pick himself up after being dumped on the floor to send an effort goalwards			2
here , our reporters kept their eye on any incidents from tuesday night 's @entity38 fixtures			0
@entity40 @entity39 @entity41 at the @entity15 evidence at last , perhaps , that even the most determined grapple tackle does n’t always work			0
just over half an hour gone at the @entity15 on wednesday night and @entity40 ’s burly central defender @entity16 had @entity11 in a virtual headlock as a corner from the right came in			1
referee @entity29 and his assistants missed the offence – only they will know why – but @entity11 managed to get off the floor in time to volley a shot in to goalkeeper @entity54 ’s shins			0
@entity16 was clearly seen hauling @entity11 to the ground on wednesday night @entity29 , despite glaring evidence , did not give @entity12 a penalty during the first half @entity60 @entity59 @entity61 at @entity62 @entity63 was tap - dancing when @entity66 defender @entity65 and @entity60 striker @entity67 began grappling inside the area after ten minutes			1
@entity67 claimed he had been thrown to the deck by @entity65 , who began wagging his finger in the striker ’s face , and demanded a penalty			1
@entity65 was guilty of pulling @entity67 down in the @entity66 penalty area referee @entity63 , never one to shy away from controversy , did not give a penalty @entity78 @entity77 @entity79 at the @entity80 despite @entity78 's pre-match claims , @entity81 was n't taken off man - marking duties and went up against @entity86 danger - man @entity85 at corners , even putting an arm over his shoulder at one stage			1
at the same time , you could sense @entity81 was more conscious of not wrestling his opponent , and both sets of players were better - behaved than usual at set - pieces			2
@entity81 made a conscious effort to not pull , but was seen with his arms around @entity85 @entity78 captain @entity81 watches on , while his arm can be seen around the shoulder of @entity85			1

@entity16 got away with a blatant grapple on wednesday night
at @entity60 , @entity65 should have *conceded* a penalty for @entity66
@entity81 was more wary , but was caught with his arm around the shoulder of @entity85
