by @entity0 , deputy political editor for @entity1 @entity2 today accused defeated @entity4 leader @entity3 of having ‘ lost the plot ’ for claiming @entity6 could declare independence without a referendum the former @entity10 chairman said mr @entity3 had not been able to accept last week ’s crushing rejection of independence			1
it came after mr @entity3 claimed ‘ a referendum is only one of a number of routes ’ to independence			1
but addressing the @entity21 conference in @entity22 today , mr @entity2 said : ‘ apparently , the first minister of @entity6 said today while he 'd lost the referendum , never mind , he might be able to seize power some other way			2
’ he added : ‘ i just say to mr @entity3 - you lost the argument , you lost the referendum , you 've lost office , and now you 've lost the plot			1
the people of @entity6 are sovereign and the people of @entity6 have said “ no thanks ” to separation and you must accept that result			2
’ former chancellor @entity2 , who led the campaign against independence , said @entity3 had ' lost the plot ' mr @entity2 ’s remarks came as @entity21 leader @entity40 snubbed @entity42 ’s role in helping turn around the ‘ no ’ to independence campaign after publicly thanking every major political figure who fought for the @entity47 – apart from the former prime minister			1
mr @entity42 ’s intervention – bringing together the main @entity51 political leaders to sign a joint ‘ vow ’ promising new powers for @entity6 – has been hailed across the political divide			1
even mr @entity3 said the no campaign ’s last minute promise of more powers for @entity58 had swayed voters			1
but the outgoing first minister , who dramatically announced he was stepping down from the job on friday , has accused @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity40 of reneging on their word			2
mr @entity3 said despite last week ’s referendum defeat the ‘ writing is on the wall ’ for the @entity47			1
mr @entity3 said : ‘ i think the destination is pretty certain , we are only now debating the timescale and the method			2
’ interviewed yesterday on @entity73 , mr @entity3 said : ‘ there are a whole range of ways @entity6 can improve its position in pursuit of @entity6 independence			1
’ he added : ‘ i think referendums are great , they have been my policy and even i have been surprised by an 85 per cent poll and the degree of public engagement , but of course for many years there was a “ gradualist ” attitude to independence			0
‘ that is to say you establish a parliament , you establish successfully more powers until you have a situation where you ’re independent in all but name and then presumably you declare yourself to be independent			0
many countries have proceeded through that route			0
‘ there is a parliamentary route where people can make their voice heard as well - so a referendum is only one of a number of routes			0
‘ i think it ’s the best route incidentally , that ’s always been my opinion but my opinion is only one of many			0
’ @entity40 ( centre ) praised @entity111 involved in the @entity6 ' @entity10 ' campaign - but did not mention @entity42 outgoing first minister @entity3 claimed that @entity6 could become independent without a referendum mr @entity3 's remarks came amid mounting nationalist fury over the perception that @entity51 was wobbling over honouring its promise to devolve more powers to @entity6			1
the three main @entity51 party leaders made a ‘ vow ’ to @entity6 voters that new powers over tax , welfare and spending would be transferred to @entity126			0
former prime minister @entity42 said there could be a vote in the commons on the proposals by march next year			0
he said : ' of course , the @entity132 timetable is not in @entity21 's hands			0
i would like to see a @entity135 of the @entity136 but we will seek to ensure that it is brought in at the latest in the first legislative week of the new @entity139 in june			0
' but the prime minister shocked @entity51 on friday morning – just hours after the result was announced – by revealing that any new devolution of powers to @entity6 would have to go hand in hand with ‘ @entity146 votes for @entity146 laws ’			2
mr @entity62 ’s demand sparked an angry backlash from @entity111 – with @entity40 accusing the prime minister of playing politics with @entity51 ’s pledge to transfer powers to @entity6			1
the prime minister has insisted that the timetable for further devolution would be met .			0

former @entity10 chairman says mr @entity3 has not accepted result
outgoing first minister said there were ' many routes ' to independence
comes as @entity40 publicly snubs @entity42 's role defeating @entity4
