by @entity1 reporter published : 19:44 est , 25 august 2012 updated : 08:31 est , 27 august 2012 the @entity2 put on a show of force yesterday after one of their most publicly disastrous weeks in recent years			2
the @entity6 attended church near @entity8 with prince @entity9 and other senior royals including @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13			1
but although @entity11 might have been praying for divine intervention to keep his son on the straight and narrow , he was not accompanied by @entity17 with whom he has been spending the weekend			0
recovering well : prince @entity9 with the @entity6 yesterday			0
they were attending church near @entity8 six days after he left hospital on the right track : prince @entity22 behind the wheel of his @entity24 at @entity8 however the @entity1 can reveal that @entity17 will appear in public this week for the first time since the scandal over his @entity29 trip broke , attending an official engagement on either thursday or friday			1
the 27 - year - old royal is due to make an appearance at the @entity33 in @entity34 in his role as an official @entity37 ambassador – a potentially mortifying experience			1
as revealed by the @entity1 on saturday , @entity17 flew up to his father ’s @entity40 estate , @entity42 , at the weekend for a heart - to - heart chat about the storm that has engulfed him since he was photographed playing a game of ‘ strip billiards ’ with a group of complete strangers in his @entity29 hotel room			1
one girl has already sold her account of the night , recalling how the third in line to the throne and his friends trawled for women in a seedy hotel nightclub before inviting them up to his £ 5,100 - a - night suite			2
she claimed the prince was the first to take his clothes off before encouraging a pretty blonde he ‘ had his eye on ’ to do the same and that his police protection officers failed to intervene as fellow revellers snapped away with camera phones			0
one sunday newspaper claimed yesterday that another girl was negotiating a warts - and - all television interview to be broadcast in the next few days			2
@entity11 has so far remained ‘ sternly protective ’ of his son , although that may well change should further explosive revelations emerge			0
significantly , although every royal present in @entity77 over the weekend went grouse shooting together on friday and saturday , @entity11 and @entity79 opted not to join them			2
@entity81 : the @entity83 thanks hospital staff as he was escorted out of @entity84 on monday it is believed they stayed behind at @entity42 talking to @entity17 before he returns to his military duties as an @entity89 attack helicopter pilot			1
royal sources say @entity11 is less concerned by what his son did than the fact he and his @entity94 protection team allowed themselves to be compromised			0
when @entity17 arrives back at his base at @entity98 , @entity99 , it is also likely he will face a stern stressing down from his commanding officer and be asked to donate two weeks ’ salary – around £ 1,450 – to charity			0
it has also been reported that @entity17 ’s new love interest , 23 - year - old aspiring actress @entity106 , is deeply unimpressed by his antics			1
and @entity17 ’s private secretary @entity108 has ordered him to close the @entity110 account he operated under the pseudonym @entity112			0
but @entity113 , whose @entity115 newspaper became the first @entity117 publication to print pictures of @entity17 naked in @entity29 , took to @entity119 to urge critics to give the prince ‘ a break ’			0
as for prince @entity9 , his appearance at @entity124 yesterday showed how well the 91 - year - old is recovering since he was discharged from hospital last monday following the recurrence of a bladder infection .			1

the 91 - year - old had led grouse shoot at @entity8
he left @entity84 last monday
