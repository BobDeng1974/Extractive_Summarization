a robotic stick insect that can walk up stairs and negotiate stony ground has been created by scientists			1
researchers at @entity6 , in @entity4 , built the robot after studying how the legs of stick insects move			1
to copy nature 's design , the robotics experts gave their six robot legs a total of 18 joints that are highly elastic , allowing it to cope with uneven surfaces			2
video courtesy of @entity19 each leg was packed with sensors to help the robot get feedback about the ground and enable the it to climb over objects			1
the legs are controlled independently to keep the robot stable , with each joint containing a drive that was designed to mimic the behaviour of stick insects			1
when it comes to building intrepid robots , @entity32 has created some of the most impressive			0
among the robots it has created in a project with the @entity39 is a humanoid shaped machine that can run , climb and jump			0
the robot can even climb across pits filling with scorpions by pressing against the opposing walls			0
another of the company 's robots , named ' @entity49 ' , is built for maximum speed and has been filmed on a treadmill at speeds of up to 29mph , faster than @entity54 sprinter @entity53			0
one robot called @entity56 can climb steep inclines and is even able to balance on ice			2
the researchers behind the robot believe it could be used to develop new types of autonomous search and rescue vehicles			0
it could also allow robots that can carry cargo over difficult terrain or help space scientists explore other planets			1
professor @entity70 , head of the biomechatronics research group at @entity6 , said : ' the way that the elasticity in @entity75 's drives acts is comparable to the way that muscles act in biological systems			2
' however , elasticity alone is not enough for @entity75 to be able to walk through a natural environment containing obstacles , ' says @entity70			0
' the challenge was to develop a control system that would coordinate the movements of its legs in difficult surroundings as well			0
' the hexapod cognitive autonomously operating robot , or @entity75 for short , has been developed to carry loads of up to three times its own weight			1
made from carbon fibre and plastic , the exoskeleton weighs just 26lbs ( 12kg ) but can carry a load of 66lbs ( 30kg )			0
the hexapod cognitive autonomously operating robot , or @entity75 , can scale steps using sensors in each leg the robotic stick insect can carry loads of up to three times its own body weight , making it perfect for carrying cargo over rough terrain or for carrying experiments to hard to reach locations on other planets stony and uneven ground can pose a problem for many robots but by using drives in each joint that are based on the leg of a stick insect , researchers have been able to create a robot that can adapt to the surface its movement is controlled using biologically inspired algorithms , based on the way stick insects themselves move and it is designed to learn from its experiences			1
the scientists have also now built a prototype that is capable of sensing its surroundings in more detail using cameras and tactile feelers			2
this has given the robotic insect the ability to see and feel obstacles in its path			0
' a major challenge will now be to find an efficient way to integrate these far - range sensors with the posture sensors and joint control sensors , ' said professor @entity144 , another engineer on the project at the biological cybernetics laboratory at @entity6			2
the scientists studied the legs of stick insects and developed a drive that can react to uneven ground sensors in the legs can detect obstacles like steps and stoney ground and help @entity75 to negotiate them cluster of excellence @entity157 ( @entity19 ) at @entity6 : @entity159			1

scientists at @entity6 mimicked the movement of stick insects
the robot moves each leg independently to scale stairs and rough ground
each leg contains sensors and elastic joints that let it adapt to the surface
the 12 kg the robot , called @entity75 , can carry three times its own weight
robot could eventually be used to carry cargo or explore other planets
researchers are now building a new prototype with feelers and cameras
