by @entity0 published : 05:07 est , 17 september 2012 updated : 05:07 est , 17 september 2012 a couple from southwestern @entity2 took off in their motorhome less than a week after the husband underwent heart surgery because they felt compelled to help search for the body of a man that drowned in a @entity13 lake			1
@entity14 and @entity15 did n’t know the drowning victim personally until his family reached out the @entity18 in hope that they would use their sonar technology and aluminium boat to help find the missing body			1
they 've recovered the remains of 80 people and participated in the high - profile searches for @entity28 and @entity29			2
on a mission : @entity14 and @entity15 started volunteering to search for drowning victims in the 1980s but they became more precise 12 years ago when they began using side - scanning sonar equipment their latest case was that of @entity38 , 59 , drowned in early august while fishing at a lake in @entity40			1
although he had never met the @entity18 , they would become intimately involved with the man 's family while working to recover his body from the lake floor			0
' we know practically everything about him , his favourite fish , and all kinds of things , ' said @entity15 , who has volunteered with his wife in body searches since the early 1980s			1
@entity15 acknowledges not everyone may understand their life 's work - he chuckled at a recent headline in the @entity13 newspaper that read : ' @entity2 couple with odd hobby bring drowning victim home			1
' ' we do n't think it 's odd , ' said his wife , @entity66			2
the @entity18 initially worked with watercrafts , dogs and gps coordinate systems , but their searches for drowning victims became more exact 12 years ago after they started using side - scanning sonar developed with technology similar to that used in medical ultrasounds			1
@entity15 first learned about the technology in 1999 when he was assisting with a body search in @entity79			1
he was horrified when the company leading the effort charged the grieving family around $ 30,000 for their time and use of the equipment , he said			2
technology tricks : @entity15 's side - scanning sonar is similar to that used in medical ultrasounds dedication : the @entity18 travel throughout the country and into @entity13 , @entity92 and @entity93 when they are called by the families of victims who are searching for closure and can not be assisted by police @entity15 and his wife purchased their own scanning sonar in 2000 and travelled later that year to @entity101 's @entity100 , where authorities sought help in recovering a young man who drowned six weeks earlier			1
the @entity18 found the body within a few hours , under more than 100 feet of water			0
' it was just such an awesome experience , ' @entity15 said , her voice choking up at the memory			1
' to actually find somebody when everybody else had just totally given up			0
' the torpedo - shaped sonar device is 6 feet long and drags behind the boat , mapping the area and recording images in real time for the @entity18 to read on a computer screen			1
the @entity18 later acquired a remote - operated vehicle , called an @entity120 , which has a grabbing device that allows them to retrieve bodies			1
@entity15 estimates they 've spent $ 100,000 on their equipment , though they do n't charge families for their time or for the use of their technology , asking only for travel expenses			1
there are other companies that offer similar services , but they typically seek payment , sometimes thousands of dollars for a day 's work , @entity15 said			1
some law enforcement agencies also have the technology but most do n't take it outside their jurisdictions nor use it as frequently , @entity15 said			1
high profile : the @entity18 participated in the searches for @entity29 ( left ) and @entity28 ( right ) help : in the case of the the disappearance of pregnant @entity28 , the @entity18 helped police operations that were underway in @entity145 , @entity146 , but the @entity18 could continue their search longer than police he and his wife , who are in their 60s and mostly retired from their business as environmental consultants specializing in water issues , do n't have children and are mostly unencumbered when it comes to travel			1
' typically law enforcement agencies will spend a few days on a search , ' mr @entity15 said			1
' they do n't have the resources that we do , they do n't have the luxury of having two or three weeks or more to search for someone			1
' in eastern @entity167 , @entity166 county sheriff @entity165 met the couple this summer when they helped search for a 14 - year - old boy who fell in the @entity172 after a boat capsized			2
mr @entity165 's agency deployed all their resources in a rescue effort , he said , but at some point it turned into mission to recover the boy 's body			0
' you can not , especially for an agency our size , you can not sustain that level of commitment toward that mission just because you do n't have the resources , ' said @entity165 , who called the @entity18 a godsend			0
' they have expertise and equipment that we do n't have			2
' a few days into the search , the @entity18 were asked to help find a 12 - year - old boy who had also drowned , @entity165 said			2
the couple recovered the second drowning victim , and stayed until the following weekend when the first boy was found			0
while some might find the couple 's work weird - maybe even morbid - @entity165 does n't see it that way			2
his agency oversees a search and rescue team that includes about 50 volunteers , he said			0
science : the couple use the reflective sonar sounds that come from the seafloor as a gauge of where the bodies may lie ' people volunteering to help other people is not a strange concept , the @entity18 just do it on a broader scale , and they bring unique experience and tools , ' mr @entity165 said			2
the @entity18 have driven twice to @entity220 and have also taken their equipment to @entity222 and @entity93			0
some years , they 'll have just two or three searchers , while during others they 'll spend more than 200 days on the road			0
among the seven bodies they 've found so far this year was @entity228 's father , who drowned in 1997 at @entity229 in @entity230			0
' you do n't really have that closure , it 's like you keep running into a wall , you do n't really get that full circle of grieving , you 're just stuck somewhere , ' said ms @entity228 , of @entity237 , @entity230 , who was 18 when her father died			0
she contacted the @entity18 in april after finding them online			0
they found her father , @entity240 , several minutes into their boat search later that month			0
@entity228 , who never expected to find closure , said she credits the @entity18 for giving her peace about her father , who has since been cremated			0
the feeling of appreciation is what keeps the @entity18 going even as they reach an age when most couples start thinking about retirement			0
they know what it means for families to have their services available , and they 've also seen tragedy firsthand			0
expensive hobby : though their boat and sonar equipment cost the @entity18 thousands of dollars , they do not charge the grieving families but ask only that their travel expenses be covered the @entity18 ’ foray into the underwater world of body recovery began when they were surveying the @entity172 in 1996 for endangered snail species with a @entity266 worker when the boat flipped and he drowned			1
' we ca n't say that we know what it would be like to lose a son or a daughter or a wife or a father or that type of thing , but we know pretty well what it means , ' @entity15 said			1
they take pride in their commitment , which is why they did n't hesitate to go search for @entity38 in @entity13 , even as @entity15 was recovering from his heart procedure			1
the day after they recovered the body , @entity15 was back in the hospital with internal bleeding due to complications from his heart procedure			2
he 's now doing better with changes to his medication and returned to @entity13 last week with his wife for @entity38 's funeral			0
mr @entity15 has vowed to continue the searches as long as he 's physically able , but his wife is thinking more and more about passing the torch onto someone else , he said			2
' we have n't really found the right person yet , ' he said			0
' it takes a bit of a special person who , in our opinion , will do more than just work on a weekend and then go home			0
it needs to be someone who has enough compassion to where they 'll stop everything and go on a search , for as long as it takes			0

@entity14 and @entity15 , both in their 60s , are based in southwestern @entity2
they travel throughout @entity315 helping the families of drowning victims by using their side - scanning sonar equipment to search for bodies
police often call for their help because they do n't have the same technology
