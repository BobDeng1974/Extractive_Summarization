the @entity1 has taken a ' step in the right direction ' by holding talks on how to provide better spiritual care to homosexual members , gay rights activists said today			1
following pope @entity10 ' famous ' who am i to judge ? ' comment on homosexuality last year , bishops have repeatedly spoken of the need to change the church 's language towards gays from words of moral condemnation and judgment , to words of welcome and respect			1
now for the first time a @entity24 meeting is discussing gay and lesbian issues within the @entity1 - a move described as ' a crack in the ice that we have been waiting for , for a very long time ' by the @entity1 gay rights group @entity32			1
among the issues the synod will debate will be how to provide better spiritual care to homosexual members new era : the decision to include gay and lesbian issues at a meeting discussing @entity1 family values bears all the hallmarks of the progressive attitude the @entity1 has adopted under @entity10 ( pictured today ) despite their apparent softening on the issue , the @entity39 's top canon lawyer was keen to make clear that the ongoing discussions will not focus on changing the @entity1 's doctrine on homosexuality , nor will it lead to an endorsement of gay marriage or even gay unions			1
but the decision to include gay and lesbian issues at a meeting discussing @entity1 family values bears all the hallmarks of the progressive attitude the @entity1 has adopted under @entity10			1
on the other hand the last pope , @entity62 , penned some of the modern @entity1 's key documents opposing homosexuality when he was head the @entity39 's orthodoxy office in the 1980s			2
' i think what we 're seeing is a crack in the ice that we have been waiting for , for a very long time , ' said @entity74 , executive director of @entity32			2
' it 's a sign of a first step			0
' church teaching holds that gay acts are ' intrinsically disordered , ' sinful and a ' serious depravity , ' and that homosexual inclination is ' objectively disordered			2
' at the same time , it says homosexuals themselves must be treated with respect and compassion and not suffer discrimination			0
' i know scores of people who have left the @entity1 because of those words , ' @entity74 said			0
progressive : the @entity39 synod is discussing gay and lesbian issues within the @entity1 for the first time			1
the move has been described as ' a crack in the ice ' by the @entity1 gay rights group @entity32 emeritus pope @entity62 penned some of the @entity39 's key documents on gays when he headed the @entity39 's orthodoxy office ; a 1986 letter of his to bishops on providing pastoral care to gays insisted that any church program must clearly state ' that homosexual activity is immoral			1
' his 2003 document opposing same - sex unions made clear that ' there are absolutely no grounds for considering homosexual unions to be in any way similar or even remotely analogous to @entity117 's plan for marriage and family			0
' the @entity39 's top canon lawyer , cardinal @entity120 , yesterday said that the @entity1 would ' never ' accept gay marriage or even bless a gay union			1
despite that unbending position , there 's no doubting that a shift in tone has occurred			0
@entity128 , co-president of the @entity129 , said it was clear that the synod wo n't change doctrine , but that the ' @entity133 ' appeared to be trickling down to local bishops			0
many had ' lost their fear ' and are freer now to engage in dialogue with gays in a way they could n't under the last two popes , he said			0
' with @entity62 vanished from the scene , @entity10 has given signals for bishops to start pastoral work and dialogue , ' he said			0
welcome : @entity24 @entity146 guards salute @entity10 as he arrives for the synod earlier in the week pope @entity10 famously said ' who am i to judge ? ' when asked in 2013 about rumors that a top priestly adviser had a gay lover			1
@entity74 , of @entity32 , said the next step is for gays to be at the table offering their testimony to bishops			0
no openly gay @entity1 have addressed the closed - door synod , but two @entity1 heterosexual couples have spoken about experiences of devout @entity1 welcoming gays or trying to provide pastoral care for them			1
he said he was ' euphoric ' that some bishops had said language such as ' intrinsically disordered ' was wholly ineffective in bringing people closer to the church			0
not so fast , say conservative @entity1			1
hard - line cardinal @entity167 , who heads the @entity39 's high court , insisted that gay sex was and will remain ' intrinsically disordered ' and children must be protected from thinking otherwise			2
he was responding to testimony from an @entity173 @entity1 couple who told the synod about friends who welcomed their gay son and his partner to a @entity179 party			2
' that particular form of relationship should not be imposed upon family members , and especially upon impressionable children , ' @entity167 told the conservative @entity184			0
' and i urge parents or grandparents - whoever it may be - to be very , very prudent in this matter and not to scandalize their children or grandchildren			0

@entity1 includes gay and lesbian issues at synod for the first time
@entity39 meeting will discuss how better to serve its homosexual members
move has been welcomed as ' a crack in the ice ' by gay rights groups
decision bears hallmarks of progressive attitude @entity1 has adopted on sexuality since @entity10 ' famous ' who am i to judge ? ' comment last year
however conservative @entity1 say their views on gays will ' never ' change
