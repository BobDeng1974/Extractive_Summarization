by @entity0 published : 06:36 est , 25 february 2013 updated : 06:55 est , 25 february 2013 it was a tv show known for its legions of dedicated fans			2
and now it seems @entity6 obsessives are about to go one step further than ever before after a call to arms from their heroes			2
the northern @entity12 scientific research organisation , the @entity11 , has been asking members of the public to come up with new names for two of @entity18 's moons			1
call to arms : @entity20 , left , and @entity21 , right , have been urging fans of @entity6 to vote @entity23 as the new name of one of @entity18 's moons the names will then be passed to the @entity27 which will make the final call			1
and its looking increasingly likely that one of the names will be @entity23 - which is known to @entity6 fans as the home planet of @entity34 - the loyal member of the @entity35			1
@entity6 fans have been urged to vote for the new name by none other than @entity38 and mr @entity34			1
@entity20 - who played @entity34 - said it was ' logical ' that one of the moons should be named @entity23			1
but his former captain , @entity38 , played by @entity21 - even urged @entity43 to write to the @entity11 to recommend the name			2
appeal : members of the public have been asked to come up with new names for two of @entity18 's moons			1
the planet is pictured stars : @entity21 as admiral @entity38 and @entity20 as @entity34 are seen in the 1991 film @entity52 : the @entity53 writing on his @entity55 page earlier this month , mr @entity21 showed his delight that the name was added as an option			1
he said : ' it apparently made a difference as they now have added it as an official name			0
' is nâ€™t that wonderful			0
' following the public appeals by two of the show 's iconic stars , the name was added as one of the 21 options			1
and it quickly rocketed to the top of the tally			0
by friday afternoon , it had about 140,000 votes , which was way ahead of its next two closest alternatives called @entity77 and @entity78 which both had about 80,000 votes each			0
the voting finished at noon today			0
the @entity27 will make the final call			0
the @entity11 will propose the top two names from the list			2
the two moons which will be named are currently known as @entity85 and @entity78			0
the two orbiting spheres were only discovered in 2011 and 2012 following images from the @entity88 .			0
