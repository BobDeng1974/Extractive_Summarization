@entity1 manager @entity0 admits he would not be able to ease striker @entity2 through the remainder of the season even if he wanted to			1
the @entity5 international is set to return from a four - week absence with a hamstring injury this weekend at home to @entity10			1
considering the workload the 21 - year - old has had over the last 10 months , taking in the @entity14 in @entity15 and then heading straight into a @entity17 and @entity18 campaign , there may have been a temptation to let their top scorer have a more restful end to the season with the @entity1 having nothing to play for			1
@entity0 admits he would not be able to ease @entity2 ( pictured ) back in even if he wanted to @entity1 striker @entity2 is set to return from a four - week absence with a hamstring injury this weekend however , @entity0 believes he would have a difficult time trying to convince him to take it easy , even if he was inclined to protect his striker from more injuries before the end of the campaign			1
' i think it would be near - enough impossible to keep @entity36 away from the football pitch at this stage			2
it 's not in his nature , ' said the @entity41			2
' someone like @entity36 needs to be on the football pitch			2
he is only 21 and i do n't think there is any need for that at all			0
' if i am completely honest i think he has been suffering a lot in the last seven to 10 days that he has been injured and away from the team			0
' @entity36 belongs on the pitch , working for the team and scoring goals and becoming important and i do n't think there is a strong case to rest him now			0
' what we have to make sure is when he gets involved with @entity5 in june he gets a proper break and he can recover and regenerate and get ready for next season			2
' @entity2 struggled to find his form in the first half of the season after the @entity14 and he had only two goals to his name by mid-october			1
in 26 appearances up to and including january 1 he scored just seven times , but @entity0 believes once he regained full sharpness there was a significant change			1
that is backed up by his statistics since january 1 as he has scored 11 in 16 matches			0
@entity0 believes he would have a difficult time trying to convince striker @entity2 to take it easy @entity1 manager @entity0 pictured at the @entity77 where his side drew 1 - 1 with @entity79 ' i think there have been two clear different periods , ' added @entity0			1
' coming back from the @entity14 was a really tough moment from a physical point of view to get back to his best level			0
' we worked really hard to get him back to the level and from the last week of december there was a real change for someone like him who relies on his physical capability			0
' i thought he hit the best level and from that point on we have seen a completely different @entity2 : someone who was in control of his movements and then the power and pace was very effective			1
' he has always been a clinical goalscorer and i think his level has generally been quite impressive			0
' in four @entity100 ties in the knockout stage @entity2 scored seven times , including a hat - trick against @entity104 in @entity105			2
with 18 goals in total this season he is @entity1 's leading scorer by some considerable margin ( @entity109 and @entity110 have nine apiece )			2
@entity0 believes @entity2 has shown he can shoulder the burden which comes with his £ 28million price tag			1
@entity2 pictured scoring for @entity113 in the @entity100 round of 16 at @entity115 previously @entity0 believes @entity2 has shown he can shoulder the burden which comes with his £ 28million price tag @entity0 will try to get @entity1 three points in their push for the top half of the table on saturday ' what he has done in @entity18 and what he has done as a young man , taking responsibility for the team , has been very impressive , ' he said			1
' he is only 21 and it is only his second full season in an important role in a team playing a lot of minutes			0
' last season he managed to play 20 full games , i expect him to play more than that this season and that will be an incredible step forward to grow and develop			0
' since january we have been delighted with his performances but i must admit since the start of the season i have been delighted with his attitude as he has taken responsibility and grown so quickly			0
' when you see rom play now you would never say he was 21 years old			0
