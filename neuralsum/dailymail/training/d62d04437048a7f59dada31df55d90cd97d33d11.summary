his report says : ' although the majority of person searches involved men , women were significantly more likely to be subject to a strip search than men if a search was undertaken			1
' his research revealed that 54 per cent of women who were stopped and inspected were later strip searched compared with only 20 per cent of men			2
reasons given by @entity13 staff for strip - searching women were that they had bought a ticket only the day before travel , were carrying 200 - pounds in cash or said they were visiting @entity45 to look for hair and beauty products			2
mr @entity5 said there were often ' insufficient grounds ' for women even to be stopped in the first place and certainly not sufficient for a strip search to be conducted			1
