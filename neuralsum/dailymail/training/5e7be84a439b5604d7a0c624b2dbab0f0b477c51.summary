@entity0 is a day away , but for those looking to find a date , how can you tell if someone is interested ? well , fortunately , researchers have worked out the science of flirting , to find out what people do most often if they are attracted in another person			1
and the results are in : starting off being encouraging and complimentary , and ending by being expressive and using open palm gestures , is a sure - fire way that someone is interested			1
102 men and women took part in a study to find what people did when they were attracted to a member of the opposite sex			1
the results show that people were encouraging and complimentary - at first the research was led by associate professor of communication studies dr @entity31 from the @entity16			1
his team gathered 102 heterosexual men and women - split 50:50 - who had never met before , partnered them up in conversations for 10 to 12 minutes and recorded them on video			1
afterward , subjects reported their level of attraction toward their conversation partners			2
then , dr @entity31 and his team reviewed the interactions - and what signs of flirtation they had shown			2
1 - 3 minutes if someone begins talking to you by dishing out compliments and being encouraging to things you say , it is a good indicator they are interested - according to the researchers			1
some people will also give a quick flirtatious glance at the start of the conversation			1
crossing legs at any point , though , was a sign that a person was not interested in the other			1
also , if a woman does n't ask many questions , or shrugs a lot , she probably is n't interested			1
4 - 6 minutes if the person is still attracted to you , they will likely be even more affirmative , and also still quite complimentary			1
they will also begin ‘ palming ' - talking using open palm gestures			2
7 - 9 minutes now , people start to do - away with compliments			1
instead , men will gaze at their partner if they are interested at this point , while women might start to divulge some personal details			1
10 - 12 minutes at the end of the conversation , women will open up and be joyful , while still palming , if they are still interested			1
for women , you ’ll want to look for a guy who has lowered his pitch from the earlier part of the interaction			1
this means they are still interested			2
the results suggest that , in general , in the first three minutes of conversation , people gave their partner a flirtatious glance if they were attracted to them			1
they also dished out a few compliments , and liked to be affirmative - being in agreement , passing encouragement or nodding along			2
in the next three minutes , people were even more affirmative , and still quite complimentary			1
at this point , they also become very keen on ‘ palming ’ - which means talking while using open palm gestures			1
in the next three minutes , though , people no longer relied on compliments			2
throughout the conversation , but particularly at this point , men gazed at the women if they were attracted to them , while women who started sharing personal details were interested			1
in the final three minutes of the conversation , the best thing to look for if you ’re a man is a woman who opens up , is smiling and laughing along , and is palming			1
for women , look for a guy who has lowered his pitch from the early part of the interaction			1
but there were also some indicators of what people did when they were not interested , as well			2
for example , crossing legs at any point was a clear sign that someone was not attracted in the other person in the conversation			1
touching the arm , chest , hair or so on was also a sign they were losing interest , while teasing was also something not really favoured			2
in addition , a woman who did n’t like the guy she was taking to typically did n’t ask him questions and shrugged , perhaps in indifference early on			2
by the end of the interaction , men who were n’t interested started crossing their arms , showing their lack of interest			1
towards the end of a conversation , women become more expressive			1
men , on the other hand , tend to lower the pitch of their voice later on			1
but crossed legs at any point are a clear sign someone is n't interested			1
and if a woman does n't ask any questions , it 's not a good sign ( stock image shown ) 1			1
being joyful ( smiling and laughing ) 2			0
affirmation ( nodding , saying yes ) 3			0
keeping the conversation going 4			0
gazing at your partner 8			0
speaking with a higher pitch 10			0
self - touching ( hair , face , body ) 11			0
playing with cards * 12			0
biting or licking lips 14			0
playing with objects ( clothes , etc ) 17			0
‘ presenting ’ breasts 18			0
self - deprecating comment 19			0
open - palm gestures ( palming ) 23			0
falling into your chair 24			0
teasing * note : these were the conversation prompt cards used in the study before the study , people self - identified their flirting styles in a questionnaire , breaking them down into physical , traditional , sincere , polite or playful flirts			1
the results are an amalgamation of the different types combined			0
the participants were given comfy blue chairs , with a coffee table nearby , when engaging in conversations with a partner			0
and they also had prompts that would help the conversations flow			0
dr @entity31 explained : ‘ we had prompt cards to read with questions to help them learn about other person , such as “ what accomplishment are you most proud of ? " ‘ these were meant to get the conversation going			2
’ first , they analysed the frequency of different types of flirting across all the groups			0
in total , 26 were identified , although some included groups of actions			0
the most popular was being joyful , such as laughing or smiling			0
in second was being affirmative , or in other words nodding and being in agreement with their partner when they were talking			0
keeping the conversation flowing was also something most people aspired towards , while people preferred to have their arms open than closed			2
the technique that was performed least frequently was teasing the other person			0
the next least popular was being complimentary			0
next , people rarely chose to ‘ fall into their chair ’ - which meant sitting back in surprise or excitement - and they also were n’t that keen on using flirtatious glances , either			2
speaking to @entity248 , dr @entity31 said he found some aspects of the research particularly interesting			0
‘ the most fascinating thing for me was teasing for everybody , whatever style , was negative in regards to being attractive , ’ he said			0
in the final three minutes of the conversation , the best thing to look for if you ’re a man is a woman who opens up , is smiling and laughing along , and is palming ( an open palm gesture , such as in this stock image )			2
for women , look for a guy who has lowered his pitch from the earlier part of the interaction another interesting indicator was that people who had a polite style of flirting tended to give their partner respect			1
they would lean back in their chair , create a distance between then , and be more evenly toned in their speech			0
he said that polite flirts thus had a hard time getting their message across , even if they were interested			0
so , what are dr @entity31 ’s dating tips ? he says that , while there are general indicators , you should play close attention to what type of person your partner is			0
‘ knowing your own flirting style , and knowing that of other people , can tell you about their intentions and what they expect out of it , ’ he said			2
‘ certain types give you clues about their style and ways of communication			0
’ he says you want to be direct , but not too embarrassing or forward , and always be on the eye out for non-verbal indicators , such as smiling and laughing or being engaged in the conversation			0

a @entity16 study looked at the science of flirting
102 men and women took part in the study to find what people did when they were attracted to a member of the opposite sex
results show that people were encouraging and complimentary - at first
towards the end of a conversation , women become more expressive
men , on the other hand , tend to lower the pitch of their voice later on
but crossed legs at any point are a clear sign someone is n't interested
and if a woman does n't ask any questions , it 's not a good sign
