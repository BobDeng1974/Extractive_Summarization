by @entity1 reporter published : 17:19 est , 12 february 2013 @entity3 : 18:53 est , 12 february 2013 speaking out : @entity4 , pictured , whose shocking video showing her botched butt surgery went viral has spoken out about the horror surgery for the first time a woman who posted a shocking video online of her botched butt implants flipping inside out has spoken out about the horror surgery for the first time			1
' i was showing my girlfriend how i could reach up under my implant and it just kind of flipped and freaked me out , ' victim @entity4 explained to talk show host @entity16 , describing the moment she discovered her quest for a perfect butt had gone terribly wrong			1
@entity4 , who declined to give her last name , uploaded the 20 - second clip , showing the implants protruding grotesquely , on @entity24 late last year in an effort to warn others of the dangers of cut - price cosmetic surgery , and the video has been viewed more than a million times			1
' i started getting really sick			0
i could n't breath , ' @entity4 added			1
the woman brought the over-sized implants onto the talk show , which caused the audience to gasp in horror			1
she said she remained in a lot of pain after having them removed			0
@entity4 is now urging women to ensure their cosmetic surgeon is the real deal before signing up for surgery , or better still avoid it all together			1
' love the skin you 're in , ' @entity4 said			2
' please do n't go and do this stuff to yourself			2
if more people would come out and tell their stories then less women would go and do this			0
' the distressing video that was posted online on november 27 shows two grotesque lumps bulging from @entity4 's buttocks , caused when her botched silicone implant ' flipped inside out '			1
instead of giving her a smooth , plump appearance , the implant pops out and is left protruding in an ugly disc shape at the back of her butt cheek			1
i do n't think an implant 's supposed to do that			1
it should n't be able to flip			2
' one user , @entity87 , commented : ' i prefer to go harder on the squats , lunges , hamstring curls and the gluteous kickbacks ... ' @entity91 said : ' uh ! ! why would she want a bigger ass ! ' implants : @entity4 , pictured , brought the frightening implants into the talk show life - threatening : @entity4 told @entity16 , right , that the surgery almost cost her her life the video was initially suspected to be a fake because @entity4 posted no details about which clinic she went to or exactly what type of procedure she had			1
but @entity106 member @entity105 , a consultant plastic surgeon at @entity107 in the @entity108 , said back in december that the clip was authentic			1
he said the ' flipping ' problem occurs when the implant is not secured firmly enough in a pocket the surgeon creates either between the buttock and the pelvic bone or on top of the gluteus maximus			2
' it is a complication which is relatively common following buttock implants			0
it should n't really happen because the pocket should be snug so the implant stays where it is			2
botched buttock : in the clip , the unidentified woman slowly manipulates it back into place while explaining : ' this is my implant flipping backwards ' miffed : the woman adds : ' i do n't think an implant 's supposed to do that			1
it should n't be able to flip ' ' this lady 's implant is flat on the bottom and coned on the top , but this one has flipped over			1
' he said it would n't be painful , but would likely need to be removed or the pocket closed up to stop it shifting around			2
buttock implants are popular in @entity143 , where plump bottoms are regarded as sexually desirable			0
in recent years , plastic surgery experts have been warning women not to have operations in unapproved clinics after a string of deaths and dodgy practices			1
back in place : the video has been ' liked ' by 278 people on @entity72 and shared nearly 20,000 times how it should look : the implant returns to its ' default position ' but may not stay there for long to insert the implant , an incision is usually made where the cheek meets the back of the thigh or in the buttock crease where the scars are less noticeable			1
the surgeon then creates a pocket large enough to insert the silicone either under the gluteus maximus muscle or on top of it			0
sometimes fat is taken by liposuction from another area of the body to enhance the shape of the buttocks			0
the surgeon will then make sure both buttocks are symmetrical before stitching up the wounds			0
but if the pocket is made too big , the implant can slip out			2
the procedure is normally performed under general anaesthetic			0
an alternative method involves injecting fat into the buttocks			0
in april last year , a 42 - year - old mother - of - three died after buttock implant surgery at a backstreet @entity192 clinic			1
@entity194 's family begged her not to have the operation , saying she was beautiful as she was , but she went ahead with the surgery			2
she was found crying in agony and begging for help after an unlicensed @entity200 doctor allegedly dumped her by the side of the road when the procedure went wrong and she died in hospital a short time later			0
in december 2009 , a former @entity205 who was obsessed with maintaining her youthful looks died following surgery to make her buttocks firmer			0
@entity210 , 38 , was rushed to hospital with severe breathing problems after the cosmetic operation			0
the mother of eight - year - old twins died from a blocked lung artery after spending three days in a critical condition in intensive care			0
@entity220 woman @entity219 was jailed for three years in july after injecting customers ' buttocks with commercial silicone in hotel rooms and using glue and cotton balls to prevent the substance from leaking out			0
federal prosecutors believe @entity219 made at least $ 1.3 million while operating her illegal practice out of hotel rooms in @entity231 , @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 and @entity235			0
in cases where silicone jabs are used , the procedure can cause a blood clot to the lungs known as a pulmonary embolism .			0
