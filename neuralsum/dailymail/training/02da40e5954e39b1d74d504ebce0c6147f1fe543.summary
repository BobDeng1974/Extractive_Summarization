by @entity0 eight months after federal agents brought down the man alleged to be running an underground web site called @entity4 that had become a thriving venue for drug trafficking , not only is the site up and running again but the new version is more vibrant then ever			1
a report from watchdog group the @entity11 claims the ' online black market economy has done a complete somersault in the six months since the fall of the original @entity4			2
' new players have arisen , including a second incarnation of ‘ @entity17 ’ and a revived @entity4 ( which seems to be thriving , even after law enforcement arrested and charged some of the new site ’s prominent figures ) has replaced the original			1
months after the feds busted the operator behind ' darknet ' site @entity4 , the site is thriving with more than 13,000 listings for drug sales online today this artist rendering shows @entity30 appearing in @entity31 in @entity32 after being accused of operating @entity4 under the pseudonym ' the @entity17			1
' a new , anonymous , operator has now adopted the name the @entity17 is the pseudonym of @entity37 , 29 , who allegedly ran the site , and who now sits in jail awaiting trial on drug trafficking and money laundering charges			1
@entity30 's lawyer declined to comment for this story and his client has maintained his innocence			2
the report goes on to claim that @entity4 contains approximatley 13,648 listings for drugs compared to the roughly 13,000 listed before the @entity51 busted the mastermind behind it , @entity37 , and shuttered , or at least attempted to shutter , the domain			1
the site is perhaps the most well - known part of what 's being called the ' darknet ' drug economy , which taken all together now contains 75 per cent more listings for drugs			1
the figures come from the report , ' busted but not broken , ' cited by @entity63 in a recent report			2
a @entity66 spokesman declined comment			2
' that just goes to show that people are still interested in partaking in this kind of activity , regardless of what happened to the original @entity4 , ' said @entity73 , a professor at @entity74			0
@entity4 transactions are often based around @entity77 exchange - a digital currency largely unregulated and valued at $ 448 to one @entity77 as of today what has changed since the first bust , @entity79 said , is the feeling that one could operate on the site with impunity , such as collecting money for drugs than disappearing without sending product to the buyer			1
' what has been denting consumer confidence are some of the large scams on those marketplaces , ' he said			0
' there is no longer a feeling of invincibility as there might have been during the heyday of the original @entity4			0
' @entity4 2.0 - which can only be accessed through a modified internet browser - sells items such as cocaine , ecstasy , fake utility bills and driving licences using the encrypted digital currency ‘ bitcoins ’			0
the value of one bitcoin - a currency not backed by a government or central bank - is currently equivalent to $ 448			0
the news that the site is thriving is unsurprising , as it was reported users had taken control only weeks after the site was supposed to be closed on oct. 2 , 2013			1
authorities have found listings for marijuana , cocaine , ephedrine , and dozens of other controlled substances on @entity4 just weeks later , @entity124 - based user ' @entity122 ' said he was selling ' 50x @entity127 @entity126 170mg @entity125 ' and they would be posted first - class by @entity129			1
the drugs were available for 1.79 bitcoins ( £ 390 )			2
another item was a fake @entity133 passport , which the vendor ' @entity134 ' said can be used ' for work , migration to @entity139 country , renting a car or other reasons '			0
this sells for 7.58 bitcoins ( £ 1,665 )			0
anyone can access the website by creating a profile - not linked to an email account - and are greeted by a note from the new @entity17			1
part of the message says : ‘ it took the @entity51 two and a half years to do what they did			0
divide , conquer and eliminate was their strategy … but four weeks of temporary silence is all they got			0
the @entity66 has declined to comment on the site 's resurgence as the alleged original operators await trial ‘ and as our resilient community bounces back even stronger than ever before , never forget that they can only ever seize assets - they can never arrest our spirit , our ideas or our passion , unless we let them			1
we will not let them			0
’ the message - on the homepage of @entity4 2.0 - adds that it has ‘ implemented a complete security overhaul ’ which ‘ marks the dawn of a brand new era for hidden services ’			0
other items available for purchase on @entity4 2.0 from various sellers include fake jewellery , clothes and accessories , adult content and hard drives full of music albums and films .			0
