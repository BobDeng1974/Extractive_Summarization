many consumers buy ' green ' or organic household products in the belief they are safer and kinder to the environment			1
but many of these products also contain cancer - causing chemicals , a new study has warned			1
@entity9 researchers found that common products marketed as ‘ green ’ , ‘ all - natural ’ , ‘ non-toxic ’ and ‘ organic ’ emit compounds that could harm health and air quality			1
at this time , consumer products sold in @entity9 , the @entity16 and around the world are not required to list all ingredients , or any ingredients in a chemical mixture called ' fragrance '			2
this means consumers can not check what the item contains and whether it is potentially dangerous			0
household items marketed as ' green ' , ' organic ' , ' all - natural ’ and ‘ non-toxic ’ could still emit compounds that damage health , a study has warned the researchers analysed 37 different products , such as air fresheners , cleaning products , laundry supplies and personal care products found all over the world , including those that claimed to be ‘ green ’ or ‘ organic ’			1
then , they investigated the number of volatile organic compounds ( @entity38 ) the products emitted			1
vocs are a large group of carbon - based chemicals that easily evaporate and get into the air at room temperature			0
they can cause short term health effects including irritating the throat and mouth , causing dizziness and can make conditions like asthma worse			0
in the long term , exposure to these compounds has been linked with an increased risk of cancer , liver damage , kidney damage and damage to the nervous system			0
the reseachers found 156 different @entity38 emitted from the products , with an average of 15 vocs per product			1
of these 156 @entity38 , 42 are classified as toxic or hazardous under @entity16 federal laws , and each product emitted at least one of these chemicals			2
they found the cancer - causing pollutants were found in many of the fragranced ‘ green ’ products and they were just as damaging as those from regular chemical products that are n't marketed as organic , researchers said			1
the most common chemicals in fragranced products were terpenes , which were not in fragrance - free versions			2
researchers analysed 37 household products and found they all emitted volatile organic compounds ( pictured )			1
these are chemicals that get into the air easily and have been linked with cancer and liver damage terpenes react very quickly with ozone ( a pale blue gas found in the air ) to generate pollutants such as formaldehyde and ultrafine particles , the researchers said			2
the researchers also warned that fewer than three per cent were disclosed product labels or product information			0
lead author professor @entity96 , of @entity97 , said this means the public is unable to check which chemicals their household products contain			2
she said : ' the paradox is that most of our exposure to air pollutants occurs indoors and a primary source is consumer products			0
‘ but the public lacks full and accurate information on the ingredients in these products			0
‘ our indoor air environments are essentially unregulated and unmonitored			0
‘ given the lack of information , consumers may choose products with claims such as green , natural , or organic , but those claims are largely untested			0

**experts** analysed 37 household products including those *billed* as ' green '
found 156 volatile organic compounds ( @entity38 ) emitted from items
these are cancer - causing chemicals that can be *inhaled* by humans
**experts** warned fragranced green products often contained @entity38
currently *companies* do not have to list ingredients in ' fragrance '
