scientists are making plans to beam messages from @entity3 out into the universe , effectively cold - calling the solar system to find signs of other life			1
astronomers will transmit signals from radio telescopes to hundreds of other star systems in the hope of making groundbreaking discoveries			1
the plan , put together by scientists at the @entity16 in @entity17 , has been trumpeted as a major step in humanity 's exploration of space			2
@entity23 scientists are preparing plans to launch a welcome message into the universe using a radio telescope			2
above , the @entity28 in @entity29 systems within a 20 - light year radius of the planet will receive the message if the project is green lit. ' there could be many civilisations out there but if they are all listening and no one is broadcasting then nothing will happen , ' said @entity40 , an astrophysicist and @entity16 's chief executive told the @entity43			2
' one question is ... if we go ahead , what message should we send ? should it be the work of a few scientists or should we involve the whole world , perhaps through the internet ? ' ' for half a century @entity51 has been searching for something that we ourselves do not produce : deliberate transmissions towards distant worlds , ' added @entity56			0
the project will be discussed at at the annual meeting of the @entity59 of @entity60 next week			0
leading academics however fear it could backfire , with @entity63 , the world 's most prolific scientist , warning against inviting aliens to the planet if they are found to exist			1
the @entity67 in @entity68 ( above ) sent out the largest radio telescopic message in 1974 leading scientists have warned against inviting contact with other life species including @entity63 the physicist is famously convinced of life beyond planet earth , but has spoken of the dangers of extraterrestrial beings in the past			1
' if aliens do visit us , the outcome would be much as when @entity82 landed in @entity23 , which did n't turn out well for the @entity83 , ' he said in a 2010 documentary			0
if the plan is approved , researchers will use radio telescopes to send out the messages			0
the telescopes transmit and reflect radio light off planets in the solar system and observe the longest wave lengths of light			1
in 1974 a radio telescope was used to transmit the largest beam in history out into the universe from @entity68			0
the broadcast was sent from the @entity67 and consisted of a simple image aimed at clusters 21,000 light years away .			0
