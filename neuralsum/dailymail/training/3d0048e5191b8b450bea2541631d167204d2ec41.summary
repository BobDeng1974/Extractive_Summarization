by @entity0 with a public execution , a violent beating and frenzied animals , it hardly sounds like ideal entertainment for children			1
but film censors appear to think otherwise – granting @entity8 : catching fire a @entity10 rating , which means it can be seen by under - 12s if they are with an adult			2
yesterday , critics attacked those behind the film for glamorising violence and exposing the young target audience to ‘ unnecessarily graphic ’ scenes			0
set in a futuristic @entity21 , the film is the second adaptation taken from the phenomenally successful @entity8 book trilogy by @entity24			0
fight to the death : @entity26 returns to the arena to fight before facing a jungle of horrors bloodied : viewers see a man 's back as he is whipped and flogged			1
later , an elderly man is publicly executed starring 23 - year - old @entity35 , it explores life under a totalitarian government which annually requires a young ‘ tribute ’ from each district of the country to compete in a televised ‘ hunger game ’ – in which each competitor must try to kill off their rivals			1
in one scene viewers witness a man being flogged and whipped by soldiers and are shown his wounded and bloodied back			1
later , an elderly man is clubbed by two soldiers and publicly executed by a gunshot to the head			1
the first @entity8 film , released in march 2012 , grossed £ 5million in the @entity53 in its opening weekend , twice as much as the opening instalment of another teenage favourite , the @entity57			1
@entity58 : @entity35 plays a fragrant , rather lovely killer			0
but a killer nonetheless in @entity61 weapons : 23 - year - old @entity35 stars in the film which is graphic , violent , and often realistic popular : the film had more viewers in its first weekend than @entity67 - grossing £ 5million in the @entity53 yesterday @entity69 , of lobby group @entity68 , accused producers of deliberately opening up the new film to children – regardless of the consequences the violent scenes will have on them – to generate box office sales			1
she also claimed the flexible rating failed to protect youngsters			0
miss @entity69 said : ‘ the problem with this particular film is that it originates from a book designed for children			1
success : the blockbuster has made miss @entity35 a household name			0
but critics blast the appeal to children ‘ and there is a very big difference between reading a gory image on the page than burning it into the retinas of young children watching it on the big screen in the cinema			2
‘ although the rating suggests there may be some adult scenes there is still little guidance , and there is nothing in place to stop parents or guardians from taking children as young as six or seven to the cinema to see the film			2
‘ the story environment at times is quite realistic and therefore the horrific violence is glamorised			0
' in a society in which children are exposed to so much violence and adult imagery we should be working to protect youngsters from further exposure in films and games			2
we do n’t need to terrify children to entertain them			2
’ prior to the release of the first @entity8 film , edits were made in order to achieve a @entity10 rating in the @entity53			1
later the same year , a dvd was released of the international version , which restored the cut material but carried a 15 classification – warning of strong violence and threat			0
yet despite sharing the same themes , the sequel , which will be out in the @entity53 on november 21 , passed uncut through the @entity10 with a @entity10 rating			1
the @entity10 report states the film contains ‘ moderate violence and threat and infrequent strong language ’			0
@entity142 of the @entity144 campaign said : ‘ the film industry puts too much responsibility on parents			0
it is n’t fair they should have to make the decision whether they take their child or not when the guidelines are so vague			0
classification on films needs to be much stricter			0
’ but a @entity10 spokesman encouraged parents to check their website for guidance before taking their children to the cinema , adding : ‘ we consider the content of @entity10 rated films to be suitable for children aged 12 and over , and we would not recommend taking very young children to see them , though an adult may take a younger child if , in their judgement , the film is suitable for that particular child			2
