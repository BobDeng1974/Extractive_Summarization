by @entity0 holidaymakers have been warned to stay out of the water at nine popular beaches after heavy rain caused sewage to spill into the sea			1
bathers have been told not to enter the sea below the high water mark - the area of sand reached during a high tide – and signs have been erected warning of the dangers			1
the sewage discharge affects nine beaches in @entity18 , @entity19 , which relies heavily on summer @entity20 include : @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity25 , @entity25 , @entity25 and @entity25			1
all of these beaches are popular with day - trippers and holidaymakers , particularly those who stay at the nearby seaside towns of @entity35 , @entity25 and @entity36			2
the source of the sewage leak was being examined by staff from the @entity40 , working with officials from @entity42 and @entity43			1
the leak was said to have been caused by the heavy rain which swept through the area on monday but a more detailed assessment was still taking place today			1
warning : bathers have been told to keep out of the water in @entity25 in @entity19 due to the sewage leak the investigators were also trying to establish the impact on public bathing areas , hoping the overflow would break up			1
a @entity18 council spokesman said : ‘ we are working with the @entity40 to reduce the impact of the spillages as much as possible and water sample tests will be carried out in the areas affected today to assess the quality of the water			2
@entity42 have contractors out clearing the waterline			0
‘ the council is keen to reassure members of the public that other beaches across the district are fully open and will advise if the area affected extends to any other beaches			2
’ this latest incident follows a previous sewage discharge on may 21 this year and @entity42 is already under investigation by the @entity40			0
it was also still being probed by the @entity40 after several similar overflows in june 2013 caused by a failure of a pumping station at @entity78			0
a spokesman for @entity42 said : ' we released heavily diluted stormwater through our outfalls at @entity83 , @entity35 , during storms last night to prevent homes and businesses flooding			0
' the stormwater , the vast majority of which was rainwater , was screened and the site operated as it should – and as approved by the @entity40			0
' the pumping station was working correctly and initially pumping hundreds of litres per second away for treatment			0
' however , as the intensity of the rainfall increased , the site ’s stormwater storage tanks - which hold 12 million litres of stormwater - filled up , and therefore the site operated as designed , first releasing screened stormwater through the 2km long sea outfall , then through the 600m short sea outfall			0
