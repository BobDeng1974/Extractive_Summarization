a man with one arm has been told he can not have a disabled parking permit - unless he loses another limb			1
@entity4 , 58 , was refused a blue badge for his vehicle by @entity7 ' because he has two legs '			1
the father - of - five has been registered as disabled since losing an arm after it was crushed in an industrial accident 11 years ago			1
mr @entity4 , from @entity7 , finds pushing a shopping trolley extremely challenging and claims he needs to park closer to the supermarket to make it easier			1
he said : ' i 'd like the council to tell me how i am not disabled			1
they said if i lost another arm or a leg then i would qualify for one			2
' so do i have to cut off my legs or my arm or my head to qualify for one ? ' they said i ca n't have one because i can carry a bag but i ca n't carry anything bulky or heavy or big			2
' the @entity15 scheme allows drivers to park in spaces closer to their destination and is recognised in most @entity39 countries			0
outraged : the father - of - five is appalled that he is not able to renew the disabled parking permit after three years of using it @entity7 said mr @entity4 is no longer eligible under new rules drawn up in 2012 by the @entity44 ( @entity44 )			1
the authority said @entity46 are issued for three years and applications for permits are ' required to undergo independent assessment to determine their eligibility '			0

' ' the criteria for eligibility in the first instance are that the applicant has a severe disability in both arms , regularly drives an adapted or non-adapted motor vehicle regularly , and also considerable difficulty in operating parking meters			0
new rules : @entity7 claim new rules introduced in 2010 require ' a severe disability in both arms or a permanent and substantial disability that causes inability to walk or very considerable difficulty in walking ' ' to qualify for a @entity15 all three criteria must be met			1
the @entity44 state that " in no circumstances should anyone who does not satisfy all three of the conditions set out above receive a badge "			0
' the guidance adds that " in particular , a badge should not be issued to a person who travels solely as a passenger or a person who has difficulty carrying parcels , shopping or other heavy objects such as luggage "			0
' in 2010 , a woman with one leg was also told she was ' not disabled enough ' to claim a blue badge , because she could walk with difficulty for more than 30 yards			2

i do n't know what to do now			0
