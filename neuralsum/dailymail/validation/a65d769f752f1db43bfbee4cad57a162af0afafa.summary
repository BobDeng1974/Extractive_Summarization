@entity0 will serve as interim @entity2 chairman while @entity3 seeks to satisfy the stock market and @entity5 he is a fit and proper person			1
@entity3 will arrive in @entity8 thursday for friday ’s general meeting , predicting a ‘ landslide ’ victory for his new regime over the outgoing old board			1
in a statement on wednesday , however , the @entity15 - born businessman revealed plans to install key ally @entity0 as chairman while he spends time convincing regulatory authorities his 41 tax convictions in @entity21 should be no barrier to a @entity2 boardroom return			1
@entity3 also announced he will not stand to become a director until he has ticked all necessary boxes			2
@entity0 ( second from the left ) will serve as interim @entity2 chairman while @entity3 waits approval @entity3 ( centre ) needs to prove to the stock market and the @entity5 that he is a ' fit and proper person ' shares in @entity2 were suspended on wednesday after the club ’s nominated stock market advisors @entity31 resigned			1
@entity3 now has 30 days to undergo the due diligence required to appoint a replacement nomad and restore the club ’s @entity37 listing			1
‘ an important issue that was repeatedly ( and correctly ) raised by the previous board is the need for the regulators to be given time to complete the necessary due diligence on myself — given my intended role as chairman of the company , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ however , engagement with the regulators can only commence at the specific request of the company and that process can only be initiated on conclusion of the general meeting			1
‘ it is important that i lead by example following my commitment to transparency and accountability			0
i will therefore delay acceptance of my appointment as director until the regulators have completed due process			0
@entity0 has agreed to act as interim chairman of the company until this process has been concluded			2
additional board appointments will be announced in the near future			0
’ @entity71 ( left ) resigned from @entity2 on monday and fans want @entity73 ( right ) to go too supporters want fiace director @entity75 ( second from the right ) to resign as well adopting a conciliatory tone before seeking to convince the @entity5 ’s professional game board of his fit and proper status , @entity3 added : ‘ the club must also take this opportunity to re-build relationships with the football community in @entity85			1
this will be to the benefit of the club and @entity85 football as a whole			0
’ there was a less conciliatory tone towards @entity31 after the @entity93 resigned on wednesday			0
without a nominated advisor , @entity2 shares can not trade on the @entity96 and so were duly suspended			2
the move will do nothing to prevent the staging of friday 's @entity100 , where @entity3 is now certain to oust @entity101 ’s placemen @entity73 and @entity75 from the @entity103 board before installing @entity0 and @entity104 in their place			1
rounding on @entity31 and their representative @entity107 , @entity3 said : ‘ it is blatantly dishonest to suggest that my imminent appointment to the board was of concern to them			2
@entity3 has won his battle for control of @entity2 and also wants to rid the club of @entity73 and @entity75 @entity3 has all but completed his takeover of @entity2 after a two - year battle for control of the club ‘ fortunately , the general meeting is not affected by the suspension			1
the new board will proceed to ensure that the listing is resumed as soon as possible			0
‘ i ask that all who attend the general meeting on friday do so with the calmness and the dignity that is befitting of this great club			1
’ finance expert @entity129 believes the suspension of @entity2 shares is only an issue if @entity3 fails to name a new nomad within 30 days			1
in wednesday ’s statement , the @entity134 chairman of @entity135 repeated his claim that he already has one lined up			0
and @entity129 said : ‘ nothing is going to happen now until the new board is sorted out , whoever that is			0
‘ the new board will then have to satisfy a @entity93 to take on the @entity2 appointment			2
‘ you would imagine , given @entity3 ’s stated intention to get rid of the existing @entity93 , that he will have done his homework and will have another one lined up			2
‘ from his perspective , he will hopefully have someone ready to step in and take up that role			0
‘ if he has not lined up someone he has a month to sort it out			0
‘ so in principle the suspension of shares is not a huge issue unless he has not lined someone up and all the nomads turn around and say : “ sorry , mr @entity3 has 41 convictions in @entity21 ”			0
‘ it could get to the point where , if he does n’t step away from the board , the shares would be permanently suspended but i think that would be pretty unlikely			0

@entity0 will serve as a *placeholder* chairman at @entity2
@entity3 has to prove to the @entity5 he 's a fit and proper person
the club will hold a general meeting on friday
the remaining board *members* will ( likely ) be ousted at the meeting
