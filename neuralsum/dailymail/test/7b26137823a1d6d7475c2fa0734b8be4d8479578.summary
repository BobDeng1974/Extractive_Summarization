the @entity0 are to spread the net far wider than expected in their search for the director of cricket to replace the axed @entity6			1
it was widely believed that the new @entity0 regime led by chief executive @entity9 and chairman @entity10 would waste little time in appointing from a short list of former @entity13 captains @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16			1
but instead the @entity17 are going to instigate a recruitment process involving head hunters @entity19 , who would be expected to suggest some overseas candidates as well as the trio already in the frame			1
@entity16 admitted he has had no contact with the @entity0 over the role of @entity13 cricket director @entity14 has been among the leading candidates to take up the newly - created role with @entity13 the main problem is that the job description has yet to be fixed			1
crucial issues will be the amount of travel involved and how much power the new director will hold on selection and the hiring and firing of captains and coaches			2
the @entity0 are still finalising those parameters before the headhunters start preparing their recommendations			1
@entity46 leader @entity45 was spotted in the @entity48 heartland that is the @entity50 golf tournament played by public school old boys ’ teams every april since 1925 at @entity54 and @entity55 ’s			0
however @entity45 , rather than electioneering , was cheering on his alma mater @entity60 , for whom his son @entity56 was playing			0
@entity13 manager @entity61 is keeping in with his boss , @entity63 chairman @entity62 , by launching @entity64 2015 , the annual clash between @entity66 and @entity68 universities over 50 sports and 132 fixtures during three days of competition starting on april 24			1
@entity61 ’s appearance at @entity66 ’s @entity74 campus is a favour to @entity62 , the outgoing @entity76 chancellor			0
but a new contract after @entity78 might be a bit much to ask in return			0
@entity61 is launching @entity64 2015 , the annual clash between @entity66 and @entity68 universities the severe cuts that @entity83 have been forced to make since agreeing their £ 11m - a - match @entity86 deal is apparent even in the @entity87			0
last year the @entity83 cricket team stayed at @entity91 ’s luxury @entity90 resort but are now in the cheaper @entity92			2
their hotels in @entity13 are n’t as good as they ’ve become accustomed to either			1
meanwhile top @entity83 executive @entity94 , controller of @entity96 , has a bell on his desk at @entity99 , though a @entity83 spokesman insisted he does n’t ring it to summon staff			0
maybe he rings it every time one of his reporters refers to ‘ @entity83 sources ’ , which would be often			0
@entity107 so good for @entity108 @entity108 have relented over their fierce opposition to @entity111 , who covered matches off the television , and have employed one of the @entity107 ’s main commentators @entity117 for their county cricket team			2
this would have been unthinkable three years ago when @entity108 ’s @entity120 threatened to resign from the @entity121 , who were funding the @entity107 operation			0
and @entity120 ’s colleague , the late @entity124 wrote : ‘ the thought of having to listen to predators who purport to be producing commentaries from sofa or armchair , without paying a penny to the @entity0 for the rights , is too ghastly to contemplate			1
’ @entity108 producer @entity108 said : ‘ there is no issue with @entity117 , he ’s a good commentator			0
’ @entity108 have employed @entity111 's @entity117 ( right ) for their county cricket team one face missing from the @entity13 tour party in the @entity87 is specialist maths analyst @entity139 , an important figure given coach @entity142 ’ love of data			1
the @entity0 say @entity139 ’s replacement by newcomer @entity145 is merely a rotation policy			1
@entity145 , who worked for @entity147 , joined the @entity0 after @entity149 ’s analyst sister @entity148 decided to go travelling			2
‘ @entity150 had an eventful @entity151			0
he hurt his toe after kicking out in anger in his hotel room following a bar - room debate about the importance of cricket stats , during which he was mocked by the awful @entity159 for not playing cricket to a high level			2
it is also understood that @entity139 was frustrated that @entity142 , for all dependence on data , did n’t make the most of his intensely detailed work .			0

the @entity0 were expected to appoint a former @entity13 captain for the role
the job description for the new cricket role has yet to be fixed
@entity19 expected to suggest overseas candidates
