@entity0 returns to @entity2 action on monday amid accusations that a bust - up with international strike partner @entity5 could cost @entity6 a place at @entity8			1
that ’s the view of former @entity11 captain @entity10 , who saw @entity12 and @entity5 screaming at each other during the 3 - 1 qualifying win over @entity15 , @entity6 ’s sole win so far between defeats by @entity18 and @entity19			1
the two frontmen have rarely got on and no longer speak to each other			0
but @entity10 is convinced @entity12 , who has been labelled a troublemaker before , will not cause problems for @entity24 at @entity25 , who take on @entity27 on monday			1
all he wanted was other players to serve the right balls to @entity12			1
' with the help of @entity44 , who was brilliant , @entity6 got to third in the @entity35			2
but the problems have far from disappeared			0
against @entity15 , @entity5 was mouthing off again and the old confrontation with @entity12 came back to the surface			1
’ united fans must be praying that @entity12 ’s @entity11 feuds are forgotten now he has returned to his club and former national boss			2
there were rumours last season that @entity12 and @entity55 , @entity33 ’s predecessor , had a bust - up over the @entity59 ’s training regime			2
after @entity55 was sacked he made a point of thanking the @entity25 staff but not the players , who he felt let him down			0
@entity6 were beaten 2 - 0 by @entity19 in their qualification campaign last week @entity24 built a team around @entity12 , somewhat neglecting @entity5 @entity33 , meanwhile , has warned injured and suspended players they face a fight to win their places back			1
@entity25 beat @entity68 2 - 1 before the international break without 10 players , including @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73			0
some are available to return against @entity27 , though @entity73 is still serving a three - match ban , but @entity33 warned : ‘ nobody is walking back in my team , believe me			0
you have to earn it on the training ground			0

@entity10 claims @entity0 and @entity5 were screaming each other during qualifying win against @entity15
@entity6 have lost two out of their three @entity8 qualifying *fixtures*
@entity10 says @entity24 used to build the team around @entity12
