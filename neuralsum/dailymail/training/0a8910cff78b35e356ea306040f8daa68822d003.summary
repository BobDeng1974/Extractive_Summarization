by @entity0 published : 08:29 est , 16 march 2012 updated : 08:34 est , 16 march 2012 a craze in which people swallow a spoonful of cinnamon without water could choke participants , doctors have warned			1
the so - called @entity8 has resulted in some people being admitted to hospital			1
however , this has not stopped an army of young people taking part in the craze - and even a host of adults , including the @entity18 and two @entity20 basketball players			1
the ' challenge ' has been around for years but - somewhat inexplicably - has suddenly spiked in popularity again with a surge of videos being uploaded to @entity25			1
participants are seen pouring the finely - ground spice into their mouths and trying to swallow it without water			1
the challenge is that because the spice is slow to break down it gets stuck in the throat - and as people try to swallow it they cough , gag and vomit			1
videos show people coughing up clouds of cinnamon , to raucous laughter in the background			1
the @entity8 involves swallowing a spoonful of ground cinnamon without drinking any liquids			2
it is incredibly difficult as the spice dries the mouth out too quickly			2
the challenge went viral on social networking sites last year and developed a celebrity following after @entity76 featured it as a ' house ' task in 2011			1
@entity20 stars @entity80 and @entity82 also posted a @entity25 clip of themselves doing the @entity8			1
however , doctors say the prank is dangerous as it could result in particles of the spice being inhaled through the windpipe and into the lungs , which could cause inflammation - and even choking			0
a spokesman for the @entity91 told the @entity92 : ' it is an obvious choking hazard and there is a risk of inhaling the dust			0
this certainly is not advisable			0
' one video alone has been viewed almost 9 million times since it was uploaded last month			0
it shows a woman filling a ladle with cinnamon and carefully pouring the powdered spice into her mouth			0
moments later , she spits out the powder and a coughing fit ensues			0
eventually she downs water to try to get rid of the cinnamon			0
other videos show teenagers coughing up clouds of powder and vomiting			2
parents are being warned to educate their children of the dangers after a student was admitted to hospital last month with lung problems			1
and some schools in the @entity122 have banned students from bringing the spice on campus in a bid to stop them from taking part in the @entity8			1
according to the @entity92 , one high school principal was forced to email parents after the students spent four days in hospital after attempting the challenge			1
@entity134 , principal at @entity135 in @entity136 , @entity137 , said : ' the kids all know about this from the @entity140 but the parents have no idea			2
' however , the @entity8 is not just the preserve of the young			0
adults are getting in on the action too			0
@entity147 governor @entity146 was asked to attempt the @entity8 live on air while being interviewed on a @entity150 radio show last month			0
governor @entity146 was given a spoon of the powdered spice while he appeared on @entity154 and was unflinching as he put it in his mouth and took a swig of water			0
afterwards , he calmly recited the his well - worn political phrase , ' the will of the people			2
@entity162 ' , as he was heaped with praise by host @entity164			0
@entity25 hit : a cinnamon fog hangs in the air inside the woman 's kitchen never again : it 's doubtful this participant will attempt the @entity8 a second time , judging by the look on her face comedienne @entity175 also filmed herself attempting the challenge in a bid to get more hits on her @entity25 page			1
she said she was urged to do it by her fans , but was warned off it by many others			2
she told the @entity92 : ' i thought everyone was being dramatic			0
but you really do feel like you 're suffocating			0
' now watch the videos			2

surge of participants uploading videos to @entity25 results in more people attempting the challenge
parents are warned over the dangers of taking part
