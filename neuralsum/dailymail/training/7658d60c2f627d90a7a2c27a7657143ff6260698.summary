by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 from a referee ’s point of view @entity2 is a problem			1
if he feels he does not have a chance of scoring he will go to ground and demand a decision from you – at @entity11 that applies massive pressure			2
we saw during sunday ’s game examples of this when @entity16 appeared to make no contact with him just outside the area and when @entity19 laid a very light hand on him inside the area he went to ground on both occasions			0
problem : @entity0 believes @entity25 striker @entity2 ( right ) is a difficult player to referee sneering and snarling : indignant @entity2 is a nightmare to referee handle with caution : @entity2 was booked by referee @entity29 against @entity30 on sunday soft touch : @entity2 ( left ) felt he should have been awarded two penalties at @entity11 on sunday he screamed at the injustice when @entity29 rightly refused to give either decision his way			1
if @entity2 played for the team i supported then i ’d love him			2
he is a great finisher with pace and a single - minded mentality to score goals			0
he also has a great work - ethic and is a team player			0
he provides as many goals as he scores himself			0
however , all of this comes at a price and , as a result , when he plays against you then you really do n’t like him			0
what really annoys fans is the way he is indignant and insists he has never done anything wrong			1
when a referee does wave away those appeals he sneers and snarls at them in an aggressive manner			1
the conundrum for football writers , of course , will be that he is impossible to ignore as a contender for @entity64 and yet seemingly impossible to vote for at the same time			0
from my perspective as an ex referee , while i would have found him a complete pain for the 90 minutes i was refereeing him , i would have to admit that as a supporter i would want him to play for my team			1
annoyance : @entity2 's antics ( second left ) angered @entity30 players during their @entity75 encounter no contact : @entity2 ( left ) was incensed after he was n't awarded a free - kick against @entity30 aggrieved : @entity2 ( centre ) pleads his case to @entity80 ( right ) after a challenge by @entity16 ( left ) on the ball : @entity83 ( left ) battles @entity2 ( right ) for possession during @entity25 's 3 - 2 league win on sunday			2

@entity2 is a nightmare for referees by going to ground
he annoys fans with his indignant appeals
striker sneers and snarls at *officials* when decisions do n't go his way
he is a *brilliant* player but a complete pain to referee for the full 90 minutes
