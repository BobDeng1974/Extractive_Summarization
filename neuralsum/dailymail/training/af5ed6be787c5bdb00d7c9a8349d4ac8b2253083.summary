@entity1 's @entity0 will hope to turn his season around when he goes head to head with @entity6 @entity5 in the final round of the @entity8 on sunday			1
the 33 - year - old fired a six - under - par 66 in the third round at @entity11 and @entity12 to rein in @entity5 , who signed for a 70 , and at 13 under the pair are four shots clear of @entity1 's @entity16 ( 69 ) , @entity18 @entity17 ( 64 ) and @entity20 @entity19 ( 72 )			1
@entity0 , who is 190th in @entity21 to @entity22 having only made four cuts all season , had a brilliant front nine , notching five birdies and an eagle against one dropped shot , and then played the back nine in level par. lady luck : @entity0 is hoping his fortunes change on sunday ' i had an amazing start , ' @entity0 told the @entity34 website			1
' i holed a bunker shot on the first and then chipped in on the third			2
@entity37 chipped in as well - he stole some of my glory there ! so i got off to a flyer and then the back nine i was just hanging on for dear life			2
' the swing did n't feel great at all to be honest			0
i 'm hoping i wake up with a better swing			1
i had a lot of good luck			1
' on the 15th i hit my tee shot straight into the forest - it 's a tricky shot straight into the wind from an elevated tee which is never going to add up to much fun - but it bounced back out onto the fairway			1
' hopefully i have n't used up all my luck			2
the back nine was tougher today - the stretch from 10 to 13 is where you might slip @entity57 ' i 'm not confident at all but that front nine today helps massively and i 'm glad @entity37 and i have put a bit of breathing space between us and the next guys			0
it might be a bit like match play on the front nine tomorrow			0
' competition : @entity5 will come up against @entity1 's @entity0 @entity5 , who had led by four shots after the second day , said : ' @entity67 started like a train and i was just trying to tell myself to concentrate on my own game			1
' it was n't that easy out there today and i certainly did n't see a five or six under through nine holes			0
i just kept reminding myself to stay patient and concentrate on my own game , not what @entity67 was doing			0
' i was disappointed not to birdie the eighth and then bogey the ninth - three under at the turn would have been nice			0
but then i birdied the 10th and 11th and tried to get back to the thought process that i 've had the first two days			0
' i did n't quite maintain it that well on the back nine but i kept myself in there and hopefully it will be a little better tomorrow			0

@entity1 's @entity0 will come up against @entity6 's @entity5
@entity0 is hoping for some more luck at the @entity8 on sunday
