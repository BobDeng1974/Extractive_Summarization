@entity0 will miss @entity2 's clash with his old club @entity3 on sunday with a calf injury that is expected to keep him out for up to a month			1
the news is a major blow to the @entity8 champions as they try to keep pace with leaders @entity11 at the top of the table			1
@entity0 , who has been in top form this season , is set to miss four league games and the @entity19 fourth round tie against @entity20 , but he should be fit to face @entity21 in the @entity23 first knockout round on february 24			1
‘ we have some problems during the week with @entity0 , ’ said manager @entity24			1
‘ he has a calf injury so he will not be fit for the next game			1
he will be out for around three weeks or a month			1
all the rest of the team are fit			1
’ @entity0 has been ruled out for up to a month and will miss saturday 's clash against old club @entity3 @entity0 played 89 minutes of @entity2 's last game against @entity35 but sustained a calf injury @entity24 won @entity37 for december after winning five of six matches @entity24 rejected suggestions that the signing of @entity42 striker @entity41 in a £ 15million deal this week will signal the end of @entity46 ’s @entity2 career			1
the @entity48 star has been linked with a return to @entity50 with @entity51 just 18 months after joining @entity2 , but @entity24 insists that @entity41 has been signed as a replacement for @entity53 , who joined @entity54 on loan in the summer			1
‘ @entity46 is a very important player for us , ’ he added			2
‘ @entity41 arrives now in the window			2
it was a decision we took after we sold @entity53 , and he is replacing @entity53			2
we sold him because he had personal problems and did not want to continue here			2
@entity41 is replacing @entity53 , not @entity46			2
‘ it was important to replace @entity53			2
when we sold him we said we were going to have the decision in december after seeing these four months			2
we have too many injuries so it was important to have a fourth striker			2
after that , when you have the squad , it depends on the performance			2
‘ i think that @entity41 is similar to @entity53			0
he is strong , he supports the ball so in the way we play it is important to have that support , so players can arrive from midfield in the second line			0
he is an important striker inside the box , same as @entity53 , so i think he is more similar to him than @entity81 ( @entity82 ) or @entity83 ( @entity84 ) or @entity46			0
’ @entity46 and @entity85 are among the candidates to drop out of @entity2 ’s @entity23 squad to accommodate @entity41 , but @entity24 would not be drawn on the issue			1
‘ i do n’t need to do it , ’ he added			0
‘ maybe in february we need to give the squad list for the @entity23 and we will see what happens in that moment and decide which is the player who will not be in the list			0
’ @entity24 insisted that @entity96 ( left ) is ' 100 % committed ' to @entity2 @entity84 returned on the bench against @entity35 last weekend after a month out with a knee injury			1
@entity24 confirmed that the @entity100 striker is ‘ 100 per cent fit ’ with fans looking forward to his duel with @entity103 who has been outstanding for @entity3 since his arrival from @entity21 in the summer			1
‘ i think @entity103 is a very good player , and he is having a very good season in @entity109 , ’ said @entity24 of his @entity106 compatriot			1
‘ it is not easy for a player in his first season here to score so many goals			0
@entity103 is repeating what he did in the last two seasons at @entity21 and scoring a lot of goals			0
‘ i am very happy for him because he is a young player and very enthusiastic player and improving			0
but i do n’t want to compare with @entity121			0
‘ it is not the first year from @entity103 here in @entity124			0
@entity103 has eight or nine years , when he was very young first in @entity50 with @entity125 and then returned on loan to @entity127			0
he played really well in @entity21 the last two years and now in @entity109			0
the football fans in @entity106 are very happy for him and for the country			0
’ @entity24 's side picked up 16 points from a possible 18 in the month of december @entity2 beat @entity3 6 - 3 in a thrilling game at the @entity134 last season when they were almost unstoppable in front of goal			1
@entity24 added : ‘ it is difficult to score six and three goals again but i think for fans it will be a very attractive game , ’ he said			1
‘ i hope we can score the same amount of goals and @entity3 have more problems to score three goals			1
‘ it is difficult to compare one season with another			0
last season we scored more			0
we have big scores here at @entity134 but it is not easy to repeat			0
we are always trying to do it , that is very important			0
' this season there is more merit because in the last month we have no strikers and we continue scoring two or three goals every game we play			1
last season was more easy			0
