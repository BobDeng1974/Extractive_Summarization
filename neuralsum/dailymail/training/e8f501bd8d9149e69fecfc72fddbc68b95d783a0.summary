human remains are being used in secretive weapons tests funded by the sale of @entity4 poppies			1
legs , feet and possibly other body parts are being imported from @entity7 and destroyed in the gruesome experiments , paid for by £ 5 million from @entity10 coffers			1
the controversial tests have been conducted for four years – and now take place at a laboratory officially opened by @entity14 last year			1
scroll for video the test centre at @entity17 , @entity18 , was official opened by @entity14 last year body parts are being imported from @entity7 and destroyed in the experiments - paid for by the sale of @entity4 popppies tests at the @entity24 are intended to lead to improvements in military equipment and help troops injured in @entity28 however the use of imported limbs has been kept secret until now			1
the @entity31 has established that limbs are regularly transported to the test centre at @entity17 , @entity18 , but both the @entity10 ( @entity32 ) and the university refused to answer key questions including : - @entity36 donors or their loved ones agreed specifically for the body parts to be used in military tests			1
- how many , and what particular , body parts have been used			1
- who supplies the human remains and at what price			2
last night , shadow universities minister @entity44 said he would demand answers in @entity46 about where the imported body parts came from			1
he said : ‘ this is vital research but it has got to be conducted to world - class standards			0
that means proper transparency so the public know what they ’re funding			0
our soldiers need the world ’s best protection and the world ’s best treatment			0
’ tests conducted at the @entity24 for @entity64 ( @entity65 ) are intended to lead to improvements in military equipment			1
the limbs are used to assess the impact of weapons such as the improvised explosive devices which have killed and wounded hundreds of @entity73 troops in @entity28			0
professor @entity74 ( pictured ) heads the blast injury unit at @entity17 in @entity18 prince @entity14 officially opened the centre last year after the @entity10 – which hopes to raise £ 40million from the @entity77 – donated £ 5 million , with @entity17 committing another £ 3 million			1
the research is conducted by 30 military and civilian experts in bio-engineering and bio-mechanics			2
in the @entity73 the use of body parts in research is strictly regulated by the @entity85			1
the law says that remains sourced in @entity73 must come with the full consent of donors or their loved ones that they can be used in scientific research			0
but the code of practice states no such consent need be obtained if the material has been imported – saying only that it is ‘ good practice to ensure mechanisms are in place in the source country for obtaining consent ’			2
although @entity17 says it abides by all regulations on consent and ethical requirements , the university has refused to declare where its body parts come from			1
it has admitted some remains are sourced from @entity7 companies but will not name the suppliers – making it impossible for this newspaper to establish whether donors were made aware that their body parts would be used in military tests			1
last night @entity7 donor expert @entity114 , who campaigns for improved rights for those who donate body parts , said : ‘ many families in @entity7 would be horrified to know that entire body parts were being sent to the @entity73 to be blown up in a lab. ‘ it is the fact that families do n’t know that makes it horrific			1
in the @entity7 families just sign off on tissue donation for research purposes but have no idea what actually happens to their loved ones ’ remains			0
’ @entity17 has said it abides by all regulations on consent and ethical requirements , but the university has refused to declare where its body parts come from the centre ’s website states that it uses ‘ human tissue ’ in experiments but only when pressed did a spokesman explain that body parts were used , some of which are imported			1
as a result of @entity31 ’s investigation , mps on the @entity141 are to probe the conduct of the centre			0
committee member @entity146 mp said : ‘ i shall be asking questions about what can be done to ensure transparency about practices at this centre			0
’ an @entity17 spokesman said : ‘ it is not relevant whether tissue used comes from donors in the @entity73 , @entity156 or the @entity7 as long as all regulatory , consent and ethical requirements are met			0
all human tissue used in the course of the research has been donated to medical science with full informed consent by either the donor or their relatives			0
’ a @entity10 spokesman said the centre ‘ exists to improve and advance treatment , rehabilitation and recovery after blast injury			0
’ he confirmed that the charity had granted £ 5 million to fund the centre for six years , and would review the situation after that			2
the @entity178 and the @entity179 declined to comment			0
a research department at @entity17 has agreed to source body parts from a @entity7 company linked to the illegal trade in human remains in @entity156			2
@entity185 will supply human tendons to scientists working on ways to improve surgical treatment for patients with joint injuries			0
@entity17 and the @entity10 insisted this project has nothing to do with the tests conducted at the @entity195			2
in 2012 , it was claimed that @entity185 was sourcing tissue from morgues in @entity198 where documents relating to the deceased were forged			0
in one morgue investigators found dozens of corpses stripped of all their reusable parts ; while authorities intercepted a minibus crammed with bones and tissue believed to be heading for a factory ultimately owned by @entity209 - based @entity185 , one of the world ’s leading suppliers of body parts			2
last night the company confirmed it ceased all operations in @entity198 following the reports , adding that it complies with relevant laws regarding consent wherever it operates .			0
