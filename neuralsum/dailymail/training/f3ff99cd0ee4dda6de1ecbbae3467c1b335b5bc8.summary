shamed former @entity2 peer @entity3 is set to be suspended from the @entity4 for claiming more than £ 3,000 for work he did not do , it was announced today			1
the former @entity8 leader was caught turning up at @entity9 to ' clock in and out ' to claim his daily allowance before leaving minutes later to go home			1
parliamentary sleaze chief , the @entity15 , investigated 11 occasions when the peer spent less than 40 minutes in @entity9 but claimed the full £ 300			1
he found that @entity3 ' did not undertake parliamentary work ' on these days and should be kicked out of the @entity15 until next year for ripping off the taxpayer			1
but , it emerged today that @entity3 tried to avoid punishment by claiming he needed the cash to pay for staff to look after his animals			1
the former @entity15 opposition frontbencher and @entity8 leader @entity3 has already spent time in jail for expenses fraud he told the inquiry , set up to investigate his behaviour , that he had to fork out for staff throughout the year - even when @entity9 was not sitting the peer said his monthly staff wage bill amounted to ' approximately £ 1,500 alone ' he revealed that he employed a man called ' @entity34 ' to ' care for @entity36 ( my bernese mountain dog ) and my chickens whilst i am in @entity40 '			1
@entity34 , he added , ' also helps me to perform various administrative tasks ( i.e. scanning , typing etc. ) when working from home '			2
but the @entity44 , @entity46 chief constable @entity45 , ruled that @entity3 had ripped off the taxpayer for £ 3,300 in daily allowance claims by clocking in but not working			1
in making these claims @entity3 ' failed to act on his personal honour ' , mr @entity45 said			1
it is the second time the peer has been caught ripping of @entity9 's pay and expenses regime			2
he served nine weeks in prison in 2011 for fiddling £ 28,000 in expenses			1
@entity3 will now be forced to repay the £ 3,300 he wrongly claimed this time			1
he also faces being suspended from the @entity4 until at least may next year - the maximum punishment available			0
@entity3 was given a peerage in 1998 before becoming the @entity2 leader of @entity8 in 2001			2
the peer , who was born @entity3 , ran the @entity63 council for 10 years while also sitting in the @entity15			1
but his career and reputation were left in ruins in 2011 after he was found guilty of fiddling his expenses and jailed for nine months			1
the trial heard how he claimed nearly £ 14,000 - including £ 174 for overnight stays in @entity40 when he was not in the capital			0
as a result , he was expelled from the @entity72 - but was able to cling on to his position in the @entity15 as an independent			0
under the archaic rules of the @entity4 , peers can not be kicked out permanently - even if they have been jailed			1
after @entity3 's suspension was lifted in early 2012 he began turning back up at @entity9 - pocketing an average of £ 3,206 a month , tax free			1
however , just a year after his suspension was lifted he was caught ' clocking in ' to claim his daily allowance without doing any work			1
in july last year he was filmed 11 times going into @entity9 before coming out to go home within less than half an hour			1
following an inquiry into the allegations the peer was today attacked by the @entity15			0
ex-hampshire chief constable @entity45 urged peers to suspend @entity3 for the rest of the @entity9 - which runs until the next election in 2015			1
the @entity2 peer was caught by the @entity91 claiming the daily attendance allowance on 11 days in july 2013 when he had not done any work			1
under @entity15 rules , peers only have to sign - in personally in @entity96 to get their hands on the £ 300 - a - day ' attendance allowance '			1
but in his report to the @entity101 , which investigates sleaze claims , the commissioner said peers must also ' undertake parliamentary work on the day of the claim '			2
the commissioner said @entity3 was unable to show that he undertook any parliamentary work on the days when he was caught clocking in and out in under an hour			2
the recommendation to suspend @entity3 must now be approved by peers in the @entity4 before coming into force			0
peers will be asked to approve the report and the suspension tomorrow			0
despite @entity3 's suspension , he will be able to take back his seat after the next election			1
even peers jailed for serious criminal offences , like @entity3 , can not be permanently removed from the @entity4			2
@entity118 lose their seats if they are sentenced to more than a year in prison			0
but peers can only be banned from the @entity15 for the duration of their sentence - or until the next election			2
@entity2 peer @entity123 was jailed for four years for perjury and perverting the course of justice in 2001			0
he had lied under oath during his 1987 libel case against the @entity130 over allegations he had sex with a prostitute			0
yet he is still a peer and has been allowed to keep his seat			0
jailed former media tycoon @entity135 spent three years in a @entity137 jail for defrauding investors			0
he was released in may last year and may return to the @entity15			0
@entity3 and lord @entity139 , both jailed for fiddling their expenses , have kept their seats in the @entity4			1
they are all eligible for a £ 300 attendance rate			0
but @entity3 , 73 , speaking for the first time since the damning judgement was published this morning , insisted he was ' unaware ' at the time that he was doing anything wrong			1
he said he regarded his peer 's allowances as a ' de facto salary ' and made it clear he intended to return to the @entity4 after his suspension			0
@entity3 , pictured here in his full @entity155 costume , is now facing being kicked out of @entity9 twice in his career			2
his behaviour has led to calls for peers to be able to be permanently banned from the @entity4 @entity3 said : ' since my release from prison and return to the @entity4 , i have had but one goal in mind , and that is to return to work and continue to serve the taxpayer , something i believe i have tried my very best to do since i became a peer in 1998			1
' following my release from prison i was suffering from psychological and physical health problems , i was anxious about returning to the @entity4 following my suspension and while it was thoughtless of me to claim the full allowance on the 11 dates in question , considering i spent so little time on the parliamentary estate , i never attempted to hide any of these transgressions , simply because i was unaware that what i was doing was wrong			1
' nevertheless , i would like to thank my fellow peers , and members of the general public , for their ongoing support during what has been the most difficult period of my life			0
' i regret that my mistakes have ultimately resulted in me being suspended from the @entity4 but would like to assure the people and organisations that i was in the process of helping that i will continue with the work that i have started , outside the @entity15 , to ensure that our efforts will not have been wasted upon my return			1
' like many other @entity15 , i believe the allowance to be a ' de facto ' salary , something which the commissioner himself conceded in his report , is an acceptable way to view it			2
' as i have stated many times before , i claim the allowance on 100 days during the year , which amounts to an annual salary of £ 30,000 and no more			2
i also consider myself to be a working peer every single day of the year and regularly conduct parliamentary work outside of the parliamentary estate , from my home in @entity209			0
' and so , even if i am not speaking in the @entity4 or participating in a debate or vote , i am still required to travel to the @entity4 in order to claim the allowance , just as there are many more days a year where i will work all day and not claim at all			0
' the fact remains that the @entity91 elected to follow me and monitor my movements over the course of a month in which i was decidedly unwell , and i maintain that had they chosen to do so in any other month since , they would have gleaned an entirely different account of my activities and efforts , one which far more accurately reflects my normal routine			0
' @entity4 does not offer any form of ' sick pay ' and while i realise that my efforts to return to the @entity4 proved to be counter-productive , i rely on the aforementioned allowance in order to pay the various people whom i employ			0
' it appears that i am now going to be reprimanded , on a technicality , as i could not provide " substantial " evidence of the work that must be carried out on the days in question , in order to justify the claim , even though that would appear to contradict the principal idea that the allowance may indeed be viewed as a ' de facto ' salary			1
' it will be difficult to recover from this most recent setback but that has never stopped me before			0
it will at least allow me the opportunity to complete the book i have begun to write on my life , and the last five years in particular			2
' many mps are concerned that continuing headlines about @entity9 's expenses regime is undermining the public 's trust in politics			0
@entity254 's @entity253 has called for @entity3 to be banned for life @entity254 mp @entity253 called on the government to introduce legislation in next month 's @entity258 to automatically expel anyone committing a criminal offence from the @entity4			2
the @entity262 mp said : ' a one - year ban is hopelessly inadequate			0
@entity3 should be banned for life			2
' if this were a case of a benefits cheat who repeatedly offended , he would receive a significant prison sentence			0
' a lifetime ban is the only appropriate punishment for the ' clocking in ' @entity3			0
" @entity272 , chief executive of the @entity273 , said : ' it 's hard to imagine what else @entity3 could do to be thrown out of the @entity4 for good			2
' it 's welcome news that he 's been suspended for the rest of this @entity9 but taxpayers are right to be angry that he 'll be back on the red benches in a year 's time			0
the reputation of @entity9 will be dragged even deeper into the mud if he has the cheek to take another penny from the taxpayer			0
' the system should be reformed so those with criminal convictions can be expelled permanently			0

@entity3 claimed daily allowance 11 times without doing any work
