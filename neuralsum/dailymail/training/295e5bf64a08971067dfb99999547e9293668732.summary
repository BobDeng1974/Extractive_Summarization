by @entity0 opera singer @entity1 has been dumped by @entity2 over homophobic comments posted on her @entity5 page a soprano has been dumped by @entity2 after she was accused of labelling homosexuals ' sewage ' and ' fecal masses ' on her @entity5 page more than a year ago			1
the company confirmed on monday that @entity11 singer @entity1 , set to star in its production of @entity14 's @entity13 , had been released immediately from her contract			1
@entity1 was to have played the lead part of @entity17 in the opera , scheduled to open on july 5			1
a post on @entity1 's @entity5 page against a gay pride march in her @entity11 home city had brought widespread condemnation , with patrons sharing their outrage on social media and @entity2 sponsor @entity27 expressing its concern			1
' i was quite proud of the fact how @entity11 society spat at the parade ... please , stop vigorous attempts to bring @entity35 's ' fecal masses ' in the mentality of the people by means of propaganda , ' read @entity1 's comments , which were taken down shortly after they were posted			1
the singer has since blamed her zealous @entity43 husband , @entity42 , for posting the comments in her name , saying he had found an article she had been writing about recent gay pride protests , changed it and posted it under her name			1
in a statement , @entity2 said the opinions posted were ' unconscionable ' , and it acknowledged @entity1 had apologised at the weekend			1
' @entity2 has agreed with @entity1 , to immediately release her from her contract with the company , ' the statement reads			1
' ms @entity1 and her husband have both made public statements in the last 48 hours with regards to comments attributed to ms @entity1			1
she has unreservedly apologised for those comments and views			2
' @entity2 believes the views as stated to be unconscionable			2
' @entity2 's decision was supported on its @entity5 page with observers unanimously approving of @entity1 's sacking			1
@entity1 denied writing the comments and has said they were written by her husband @entity1 , pictured with her husband @entity42 the opera singer has previously taken to @entity5 to hit out at claims she was homophobic , as reported by the @entity71 media			1
' for my entire career i have been working with gay people and some of them are very dear friends , ' she posted			2
' all of them can confirm that i never lost a word that might associate me with homophobic ideas			0
i respect every single human being and i am against all kind of discrimination and violence '			0
@entity1 goes on to explain to context of the post that was made on her @entity5 account			1
she points out that on may 17 , 2013 , ' a gay parade was supposed to pass directly in the yard of an @entity88 in @entity89 ' , the capital of @entity11			0
' at the same place and for the same date a commemoration for @entity11 soldiers killed in @entity93 had been announced			0
' for that reason and because @entity11 is a country where 90 per cent of the population are deeply religious , conservative @entity88 i wanted to express my sincere doubts that a parade made sense under these circumstances , in the yard of an @entity88			0
' i was worried that this would provoke people and lead to violence			2
unfortunately this is what happened then			0
' the soprano has previously taken to @entity5 to deny she is homophobic the opera singer explains that her husband was also using her @entity5 account and that he is deeply religious and has a ' tough attitude towards gay people ' ' he copied my text , changed it considerably and posted it under my name			1
you might imagine that i was not happy with that at all and i immediately deleted it when i saw the text about half an hour later			0
' this text does not express my own opinion			0
i 'm afraid it was too late and the text was already spreading in the internet			0
@entity1 said she explained the post and officially apologized to the lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender community in @entity11 a year ago and her apology was accepted and she also denied writing a letter to the @entity11 president about the issue			2
an @entity2 spokeswoman said it had been important for the company to take some time to understand fully what had been said , and to exercise due diligence			2
she said if @entity2 failed to do so , it would be acting in a discriminatory way and ' we value fairness for all '			2
' having now taken this time , @entity2 believes the views expressed by @entity1 to be unconscionable , and has therefore taken action to part ways			1
' we have all felt this to be emotional and disturbing and have sought to bring this situation to a resolution as fairly and quickly as possible			0
' @entity1 , pictured far right , will no longer star in the leading role of @entity17 in its production of @entity14 's @entity13 on monday , @entity1 shared @entity5 a post by her husband @entity42 , written at about midday monday , in which he broke his silence to address ' mushrooming pathos and hatred ' in the media about the post			1
' for me it is hard to watch how affected she ( @entity1 ) is , and watch how people are damaging my most precious person 's reputation and her peace of mind due to which she had no share of the underlying , ' the post reads			1
mr @entity42 has taken all responsibility for the post written last year , in a @entity5 post yesterday , which was shared by his wife mr @entity42 claims to have been responsible for the @entity5 post , which caused the ' stir '			1
' at that time we used a common @entity5 profile , at the same time , i thought to use @entity169 's popularity , and to reached ( sic ) my voice to numerous audience i published a letter on her behalf , ' he posted			1
' the letter was signed on our @entity5 page , when @entity169 returned home she erased the letter and got very upset			1
however , a few minutes were enough for people and for @entity11 press			0
' mr @entity42 said news of the post was spread by the @entity11 press , which nearly cost him ' the price of a loss of personal happiness '			0
he said his wife did not initially disclose that the letter was not written by her			0
' she had endured and suffered a lot because of the letter which i wrote			2
@entity169 has never been homophobic and especially not against western values , ' the post reads			0
mr @entity42 then explains why he wrote the post , in light of the funeral of the @entity11 soldiers killed in @entity93 , one which was his best friend			2
he said a gay march at the same churchyard where the funeral was taking place ' seemed a provocation ' and such reports were spread all over @entity11			0
' i believe that society should be naturally tolerant toward people of different sexual orientation , and at the same time people can express their will for freedom , and i thought i could express the fact that someone may not agree with the idea of gay people â€™s demonstration on the streets			0
' having lived in @entity219 for a ' few years ' , he concludes by making comparisons between @entity11 and @entity219 consciousness and that @entity11 is still not ready for some @entity219 culture in daily life			0
' that is what i wanted to say in the letter			0
however , i regret that it was not entirely clear ... and by this letter i have caused many trouble for my lovely wife and also for myself			0
' he finished by stating he understands his responsibility and publicly declares he is to blame for the post on may 17 , 2013 and that ' all the damage should be on myself '			0
' it is unbearable to me that the year later , when her ( @entity1 's ) explanation and apology after the incident is over in @entity11 , released articles in the foreign press again caused controversy around this delicate issue , ' the post ends			1
in the post , mr @entity42 apologies for damage he has caused to his wife 's reputation			2
