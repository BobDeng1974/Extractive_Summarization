by @entity0 published : 07:10 est , 13 june 2012 updated : 05:52 est , 14 june 2012 coalition relations hit an all - time low yesterday after @entity2 refused to back @entity3 as he was branded a ‘ liar ’ in @entity4			2
@entity7 mps called their partners ‘ traitors ’ and vowed revenge – promising to vote against @entity11 ’s plans to reform the @entity12 and to withdraw support for @entity2 ministers in difficulty			1
but there was uproar as speaker @entity18 allowed @entity19 to accuse the beleaguered culture secretary of lying to @entity6 over his handling of @entity23 ’s take - over bid for @entity24			0
the @entity36 , who is widely expected to be moved from his job in a forthcoming reshuffle , told mps the accusation was ‘ disgraceful ’			0
but he admitted he may have ‘ inadvertently ’ provided incorrect information when he claimed in the @entity42 to have released all his correspondence relating to the deal			0
a @entity19 motion calling for mr @entity3 to be referred for investigation by sir @entity47 , the independent adviser on the @entity48 , was defeated by 290 to 252 votes			1
this was despite mr @entity11 ordering his @entity2 mps to abstain , a move seen as an unprecedented slap in the face for @entity27			0
on his bike : @entity3 leaves his @entity57 home yesterday one @entity7 mp , @entity58 , had to return from his honeymoon in @entity60 to take part in the vote , while another , @entity63 , was forced to leave his hospital bed			2
mr @entity27 decided less than half an hour after mr @entity3 concluded his evidence to the @entity66 a fortnight ago that he would not order a further investigation into whether ministerial rules had been broken			1
it emerged at the inquiry that hundreds of texts and phone calls were exchanged between mr @entity3 ’s special adviser @entity73 and @entity74 opposition mps also allege mr @entity3 misled @entity4 when he said he made no intervention in the bid while business secretary @entity78 was handling it , since it has now emerged that he sent mr @entity27 a memo effusively backing the @entity80			1
the @entity36 suggested that he had not lied , but may have ‘ inadvertently ’ misled @entity4 by failing to disclose the note , in which he said that failing to agree to the bid for the broadcaster would set @entity85 ’s media sector back a decade			2
shadow minister @entity86 said mr @entity3 had told mps that it would be too expensive to detail all of his exchanges on the subject			2
‘ how much would it have cost to reveal he sent a letter to the prime minister ? he has lied to @entity4 ! ’ mr @entity86 shouted , prompting angry protests from @entity7 mps			1
mr @entity3 said there was a ‘ huge difference between misleading @entity4 inadvertently and lying ’			2
the prime minister told @entity6 that he ‘ understood ’ the motives of the @entity2 in not backing mr @entity3 , saying it was ‘ politics ’			1
mr @entity11 told his @entity2 mps to stay away from yesterday ’s vote , but caused confusion when he then backed mr @entity3 ’s handling of the bid during his own evidence to the @entity66			1
@entity108 : commons speaker @entity18 intervenes during the debate for @entity19 's motion calling for culture secretary @entity3 to face an inquiry of his handling of the @entity24 bid by @entity74 he said the @entity36 had given a ‘ full , good and convincing account of himself ’			1
@entity2 aides said mr @entity11 believed sir @entity47 should investigate a potential breach of the @entity48 , nonetheless , given that ministers are meant to take responsibility for the actions of their special advisers			1
@entity7 party bosses asked mps not to attack @entity2 publicly for their failure to back mr @entity3			1
but several ignored the edict			0
conservative mp @entity127 said : ‘ everyone is furious on our side			0
@entity3 is a good man and the questions about him have all been covered			0
split : the decision by deputy prime minister @entity11 is said to have angered his partner in @entity135 , @entity27 ‘ i think it will hit home to a lot of people that they are traitors , that they are not proper members of this government			0
’ @entity143 , a @entity7 member of the culture select committee , said the @entity2 were ‘ being silly ’			0
another senior mp said privately : ‘ on our side we ’ve fought for @entity2 who got into trouble , like @entity149			0
‘ this is a fundamental breach of faith and a turning point in the @entity135			0
‘ it has actually had the effect of rallying our benches behind @entity3 and ensuring that very many people will be less willing to go along with @entity2 hobby horses like @entity158			0
’ by @entity0 published : 07:10 est , 13 june 2012 updated : 05:52 est , 14 june 2012 @entity27 was accused of a ‘ smokescreen ’ last night after insisting he had the support of the ministerial sleaze watchdog for his decision not to refer @entity3 for investigation over his handling of @entity23 ’s takeover bid for @entity24			0
the prime minister yesterday brandished a letter in which sir @entity47 , suggested that because the @entity66 into media standards was ongoing and taking evidence under oath , it would not be appropriate for him to hold a further fact - finding probe			1
‘ i do not believe i could usefully add to the facts in this case , though i remain available should circumstances change or new evidence emerge , ’ sir @entity47 , the independent adviser on ministerial interests , wrote			2
debate : mr @entity27 said mr @entity3 , top left of the picture , had handled himself well and need n't be probed over the issue labour critics accused @entity184 of a ‘ stunt ’ designed to take the heat off mr @entity3 ahead of the @entity42 vote and mr @entity27 as he prepared for his own appearance before the @entity66 today			1
they said that sir @entity47 was not being asked to establish the facts , but whether the @entity36 broke the @entity48 in his handling of the £ 8billion takeover application			1
the full exchanges , published by the @entity193 during prime minister ’s questions , made it clear that sir @entity47 had not been asked to make any judgment on whether the code had been broken			2
given that both letters bore yesterday ’s date , @entity184 also faced questions over the startling speed with which the watchdog replied , raising suspicions that the exchange had been pre-planned			0
@entity19 frontbencher @entity86 , a victim of phone hacking , said it was ‘ suspicious ’ that the prime minister and sir @entity47 had exchanged letters yesterday morning , given that two weeks have passed since mr @entity3 gave evidence .			1

@entity7 mps have called @entity2 abstention from vote an ' act of *war* '
mr @entity3 declared he never lied but may have ' inadvertently misled ' mps
he defeats a @entity19 motion calling for him to be investigated by *38* votes
@entity222 accuses *pm* of ' clinging onto ' the @entity36 to save his own reputation
letter from sir @entity47 says he would not have anything to add to the @entity66 's probing of mr @entity3 last month
