by @entity0 for @entity1 and @entity2 an association for football managers has apologised after it appeared to dismiss racist , sexist and homophobic text messages allegedly sent by former @entity7 coach @entity6 as ' friendly banter '			1
@entity6 has been accused of exchanging a series of offensive text messages with his former colleague @entity11 while they worked at @entity7 and today the identity of a woman agent ' victim ' was revealed			1
after the allegations were revealed by the @entity19 , the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) - which calls itself the ' voice of football management ' - released a statement appearing to play down the scandal			1
the @entity15 rowed back on the statement today , apologising for the ' inappropriate ' comments , which it admitted have ' been perceived to trivialise matters of a racist , sexist or homophobic nature '			1
@entity6 and @entity11 are under investigation over text messages which called @entity41 players ' @entity39 ' , referred to one agent as a ' gay snake ' and referred to another female agent 's ' falsies '			1
today that agent was revealed to be @entity25 , an agent and lawyer			0
she was unavailable for comment			0
the text exchanges date back to when @entity6 and @entity11 worked as manager and head of recruitment at @entity7 , before both were sacked by club owner @entity54 amid claims of over-spending in the transfer market			1
as the world of football expressed shock at the claims yesterday , the @entity15 put out a statement appearing to play down the seriousness of the allegations			1
it said : ' @entity6 had , it seems , sent a couple of one line texts that were , with the benefit of hindsight , very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures			0
' these were two text messages sent in private at a time @entity6 felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter			1
' the bizarrely worded statement caused outrage in the world of football , with the organisation branded ' bumbling dinosaurs '			1
the @entity81 is investigating @entity6 's messages as part of a dossier submitted by @entity7 alleging misconduct @entity11 resigned from his latest role as sporting director of @entity88 after the allegations became public former - @entity91 striker @entity90 wrote on @entity92 : ' disgraceful			1
institutional acceptance of the " banter " of casual racism			2
' @entity97 striker @entity96 tweeted : ' @entity15 actually wrote this			2
they are actually being serious ! somebody drafted that ... @entity102 ! ' @entity7 called for the resignation of @entity15 chief executive @entity104 over the incident			1
the club stated : ' we find it entirely reprehensible that the @entity15 should put out a statement which seeks to dismiss deeply offensive racist comments as ' friendly banter '			1
' if that is the view held by the @entity15 , as appears from its statement , we consider that @entity104 's position is untenable and we call for his resignation			1
' after widespread anger at the response , the organisation hastily apologised today , insisting it is completely against discrimination			2
they stated today : ' the @entity15 apologises for some of its wording , in its release yesterday , which was inappropriate and has been perceived to trivialise matters of a racist , sexist or homophobic nature			2
that was certainly not our intention			0
' but for some in the game , the apology came too late			0
@entity131 , the education and development manager for @entity133 , said : ' i wish this was the statement they ( the @entity15 ) had prepared yesterday			1
' does today undo the damage from yesterday ? i do n't think it does			0
it is welcome but yesterday will stick in people 's minds			0
i wish ( the @entity15 ) had taken a step back and said " this would have been more appropriate in the first place "			2
' the @entity15 wish to clarify the position in relation to recent reports and speculation regarding matters alleged to have arisen during @entity6 ’s time at @entity7			1
in the course of a search by the @entity152 in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff during mr @entity6 ’s employment at @entity7 , in relation to other matters , it emerged that @entity159 had , it seems , sent a couple of one line texts that were , with the benefit of hindsight , very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures			1
these were two text messages sent in private at a time @entity6 felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter			1
that said , @entity6 believes he could and should have conducted himself better on these two isolated occasions			0
the precise details need to remain private for the time being until any @entity81 process is complete			0
the @entity15 does not condone in any way any potential breach of equal opportunities laws but would also point out that out of over 10,000 text messages and 70,000 documents produced over a long period of time it may not be a complete surprise that some inappropriate comments can sometimes be made by employees , like @entity159 , working under great pressure in highly charged situations			1
if @entity6 has caused any offence by these two isolated matters he would , however , wish to sincerely apologise			0
@entity6 finds it strange that these matters were only raised with the @entity81 and in the media now , 8 months after his employment ended and the day before he was reported as being offered the opportunity to become manager of @entity88			0
@entity159 is also very concerned about seriously inaccurate and misleading reports of his alleged involvement in these matters in the media			0
it has never been alleged that he wrote any homophobic or sexist messages and he has confirmed that he did not do so			0
further , there are incorrect and damaging suggestions that he sent a whole host of offensive and unpleasant messages that are simply not true and which give a grossly distorted and unfair view of @entity159 ’s involvement in this matter			2
@entity6 looks forward to matters being put straight in due course , following any investigation of this matter			0
@entity159 can not of course comment on the nature of any conduct or communications alleged to have been made by others			0
@entity6 has said that he will be fully co-operating with any @entity81 investigation and that he looks forward to putting the record straight thereafter			0
the @entity15 apologises for some of its wording , in its release yesterday , which was inappropriate and has been perceived to trivialise matters of a racist , sexist or homophobic nature			2
that was certainly not our intention			0
it is beyond argument that any comments that are discriminatory , even used in private , are totally unacceptable			0
the @entity15 remains absolutely aware of our responsibility to the game and to promote and uphold the highest standards of behaviour			2
the @entity15 will not be commenting further on the allegations relating to @entity6 whilst the @entity81 conducts its investigation , other than to repeat that both the @entity15 and @entity159 will be cooperating fully			2
we will continue to work with all of the game 's stakeholders to address the important issues of respect and discriminatory behaviour in all its forms .			0
