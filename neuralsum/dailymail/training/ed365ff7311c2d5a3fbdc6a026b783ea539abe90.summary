' in some ways @entity47 is at its most puritanical , ' said @entity0 in response to a question regarding some of the reactions @entity3 has received			1
' the fact is people are forgetting that humor is a tool for debate			1
that boycott , censorship , shut ' em down approach to humor shows a very basic lack of understanding of what humor can do for us culturally and what it has always done			2
' reality check : @entity0 say that the character she plays on ' girls ' is also a privileged , intelligent twenty - something writer living in @entity109			1
the actress said many viewers assume the two are one and the same opinionated : @entity0 , 28 , who recently published the bestselling memoir @entity38 , said the phenomenal popularity of her series girls has seen her tagged with the dreaded ' voice of a generation ' label speaking out : the actress ended the talk with her thoughts on the increasingly prevalent issue of sexual assaults taking place in colleges across the country she also told the audience that she is quite different from her character , @entity128			2

' @entity158 lades : from left , @entity159 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity0 and @entity70 attend the @entity161 : @entity163 ' panel during the 2015 @entity7 topical : the @entity3 star and creator candidly worked in her thoughts on abortion , campus rape , and @entity4 into a panel at @entity7 @entity0 wrote in her recent best selling memoir @entity172 about an assault on her when she was in college			1
' one of the reasons it is important to talk about campus assaults is that that these women in positions of incredible privilege are still being forced every day to fight for their truth and that is indicative of the fact that sexual assault is an epidemic and so many people are voiceless			2
i think campus ' are a great place to start because that 's where we 're being educated and that 's where we 're told we 're going to be safe			0
' the four women on the panel also weighed in how they broke into the entertainment industry and the challenges they face as its minority gender			0

' they hope their current successes help pave the way for other women with @entity78 dreams			2
all four rely on writing teams populated by mostly women , but they do n't count men out			0
