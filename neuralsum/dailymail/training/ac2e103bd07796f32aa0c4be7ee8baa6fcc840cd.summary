with its incredible presentation , near - prefect controls and life - like animation , it ’s hard to find anything wrong with @entity6			1
and although it ’s not radically different from the previous game , key gameplay mechanics have been tweaked to make the experience as enjoyable as possible			1
court in the act : everything from the animation to the way each player looks is right on the money perhaps most impressive is how @entity17 have captured the feel of the sport			2
fast breaks are easier to execute than ever before , while showboating @entity21 ( achieved by a tap of the right and left triggers ) means no game is without flair			2
play - calling , achieved via the @entity28 , is a breeze , too , allowing you to change tactics on the fly			0
there are also plenty of dribble moves – with an impressive amount of combinations available at the touch of the right analogue stick			0
thankfully , they do n’t always work , and pulling them off at the wrong moment will often result in a turnover			0
shooting from deep is as rewarding as ever , made even more so by just how well - realised the players are			0
many of the most famous stars have made a seamless transition to the game – from pixel - perfect expressions , to their shot technique			2
three points ! shooting is n't easy , but it 's not so hard as to put you off trying your luck from distance sadly , although the game looks incredible in motion , cut - scenes do not have the same level of polish			1
characters have a ‘ dead - behind - the - eyes ’ look about them , and uncomfortably jolt around			0
given the high - quality of the presentation – from the outstanding commentary to glitzy game menus and impeccable soundtrack – it ’s a shame such an integral part of the game is n’t quite up to scratch			1
thankfully , this blip ca n’t take away from the wide selection of game modes on offer			1
the standard pick - up - and - play matches , multi-season and multiplayer feature but it ’s the @entity80 : path to @entity83 , that takes centre stage			1
in similar vein to @entity88 ’s @entity87 , you take control of @entity80 and take part in a series of key games across several seasons			1
so close but so far : if only the cutscenes had more polish , then this could be the perfect sports game			0
there is still hope , though , when the game is released on next - gen consoles you can choose either the @entity100 – where @entity80 must help @entity101 become a dominant force in the league , or the @entity104 – that sees the star hop around different teams			1
it ’s a worthy addition , but one many wo n't find as fun as the @entity87			2
no matter , because for the most part , @entity6 is a slam - dunking success			0
agree with @entity111 ? follow us on @entity113 : @ @entity114 and on @entity115 : @entity116 .			0

impeccable overall presentation let down *slightly* by the cutscenes
*fantastic* gameplay that captures the feel and flair of the sport
plenty of game modes - *including* the enjoyable @entity80 : path to greatness
sadly , path to @entity83 is not as fun as @entity88 's @entity87
for those after the best *visual* *package* , you *'ll* have to wait for next - gen
