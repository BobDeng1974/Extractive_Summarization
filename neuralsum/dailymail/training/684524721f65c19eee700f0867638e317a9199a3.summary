by @entity0 , @entity1 editor foreign nationals arrested by the police – including @entity5 citizens – will be deported even if they are not convicted of any crime			1
the move follows a pilot scheme in @entity9 under which 2,091 migrants have been kicked out , including more than 100 from @entity11 and @entity12			1
it can be hard to remove @entity5 nationals because of free movement rules , but the crackdown will use @entity18 law stating that if people want to remain here , they must be exercising their right to work or be self - sufficient			1
this could be used to tackle groups such as the notorious @entity25 beggars , a group largely from @entity18 countries such as @entity12 which has haunted the central @entity9 area			0
rough sleepers : @entity12 migrants near @entity25 in @entity9			0

’ police and border guards began the @entity9 pilot in september 2012 after it emerged that a quarter of suspected offenders arrested in the capital were foreign nationals			1
