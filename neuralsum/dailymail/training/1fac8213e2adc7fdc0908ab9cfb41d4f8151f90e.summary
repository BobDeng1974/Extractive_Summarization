as many as a quarter of obese children tested using the body mass index - which measures height against weight , could be missed , scientists warn as many as a quarter of obese children tested using the body mass index could be missed putting them at risk of developing diabetes and heart disease , scientists have warned			1
while the @entity11 correctly identifies obese children it does not measure a child 's percentage body fat			1
the test , which uses a person 's height and weight to determine whether they are obese , does not measure waist size			2
the larger a person 's waist measurement , the more likely they are to suffer obesity - related diseases , including type 2 diabetes and heart disease			1
it is that failure of the test that has led scientists at the @entity30 's @entity29 to warn relying on @entity11 alone could mean large numbers of children at risk of obesity - related disease could be missed under the radar			1
dr @entity37 , senior study author from the @entity29 , in @entity38 , said : ' if we are using @entity11 to find out which children are obese , it works if the @entity11 is high , but what about the children who have a normal @entity11 but do have excess fat ? ' those parents may get a false sense of reassurance that they do not need to focus on a better weight for their children			2
' in the study , published in @entity53 , the researchers used 37 eligible studies that evaluated 53,521 patients , aged between four and 18			0
it is the first systematic review to assess the diagnostic performance of @entity11 to identify excess body fat as compared with other techniques considered as standard to measure obesity			2
dr @entity69 , the study 's first author , said : ' it is known that childhood obesity can lead to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease			0
' our research raises the concern that we very well may be missing a large group of children who potentially could be at risk for these diseases as they get older			0
' we hope our results shine a light on this issue for physicians , parents , public health officials and policymakers			0
' while the @entity11 correctly identifies obese children it does not measure a child 's percentage body @entity93 test , which uses a person 's height and weight to determine whether they are obese , does not measure waist size			1
the larger a person 's waist measurement , the more likely they are to suffer obesity - related diseases the findings of this study mirror results found in past research examining adults , carried out by @entity107			1
over several years he and a team of researchers discovered what they call normal weight obesity			0
it describes a situation where adults have a normal @entity11 but a large percentage of body fat			2
normal weight obesity shares some of the same risks as obesity , including pre-diabetes , metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular death			0
he said : ' the lesson is that we need additional research in children to determine the potential impact of having high fat in the setting of normal @entity11 to recognise this issue and perhaps justify the use of body composition techniques to detect obesity at an early stage			0

@entity11 is a relative measure of weight based on height and body mass
it calculates whether a person is *underweight* , normal , *overweight* or obese
but the test does not measure percentage body fat or waist *circumference*
the larger a person 's waist measurement the more prone they are to obesity - related diseases including diabetes and heart disease
scientists at the @entity29 say *25* *%* of obese children could be missed by @entity11 tests because they appear to be a normal weight but have high body fat
