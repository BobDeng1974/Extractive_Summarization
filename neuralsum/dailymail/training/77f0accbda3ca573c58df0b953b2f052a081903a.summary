string bends , tapping , vibrato and whammy bars are all techniques that add to the distinctiveness of a lead guitarist 's sound , whether it 's @entity8 , @entity9 , or @entity10			1
now guitarist and physicist dr @entity11 has described the physics underlying these techniques in the journal @entity16			1
and , he says , using his methods guitar players can improve their technique and become better musicians			0
dr @entity11 ( shown ) studied the physics underlying certain guitar techniques			1
he wanted to understand how guitarists could manipulate pitch			1
this included the use of string bending , vibrato and whammy bars there have been plenty of songs written about spiders and their webs , and now scientists have found the creatures are musical in their own right			1
using lasers , researchers found spiders pluck their complex constructions like guitar strings to gather information about their surroundings			0
spider silk transmits vibrations across a wide range of frequencies so that when a thread is plucked , the sound created carries information about prey , mates , and even the structural integrity of a web			0
the discovery was made by researchers from the universities of @entity23 , @entity64 , and @entity65 who fired bullets and lasers at spider silk to study how it vibrates			2
they found that spider silk can be tuned to a wide range of harmonics			0
' very good guitarists will manipulate the strings to make the instrument sing , ' explains dr @entity11			1
' on a piano , you 've got the 12 chromatic notes in a scale			0
on a guitar , you can bend the strings to get the notes in between			0
' i wanted to understand what it was about these guitar techniques that allows you to manipulate pitch			1
' dr @entity11 is a postdoctoral researcher in @entity23 's @entity89 , and normally spends his time working on mathematical models of oxygen distribution in order to improve radiotherapy in the treatment of cancer			1
but he is also a keen guitarist , and has been a session musician and member of a band in @entity100 in the past			0
in spare time at his previous position at @entity104 and now at @entity23 , he worked out the physics behind the instinctive playing of the best guitarists			2
dr @entity11 derived equations describing how string bending , vibrato and whammy bars change the pitch of a note			1
he found that the properties of the strings had a big effect on the change in pitch - in particular the @entity118 's modulus ( a measure of how much the string stretches under force ) and how thick the strings are			2

he says his research could be useful to string manufacturers and digital instrument modellers ( stock image shown ) this is one of the equations derived by dr @entity11			1
he tells @entity137 it explains the bending of a note : ' it says that the pitch is related to the length of the vibrating string length , the angle you bend it through , the tension of the string t , the area of the string a and finally the @entity118 's modulus of the string e ' he also worked out how easy hammer - ons and pull - offs are , depending on the height of the guitar strings above the finger board			2
finally , he confirmed the equation for string bends experimentally , measuring the frequency of the sound produced for strings bent through different angles on a guitar			0
' i took one of my oldest guitars down to the engineering lab at @entity104 to one of the people i knew there and explained that i wanted to strip it down to do this experiment , ' explains dr @entity11			1
' we had to accurately bend the strings to different extents and measure the frequency produced			0
' he was a musician too and looked at me with abject horror			0
but we both knew it needed to be done - we put some nails into my guitar for science			0
' the physics of vibrating strings and string instruments has been long understood , but no one has previously worked out how effects like bending the string change the pitch of the sound			2
another unknown was pitch depends on the tension of the string , the force applied , and the angle through which it is bent			0
' it turns out it 's actually reasonably straightforward , ' says dr @entity11			2
' it 's an experiment a decent physics undergraduate could do , and a cool way of studying some basic physics principles			0
' it 's also potentially useful to string manufacturers and digital instrument modellers			1
