a notorious prisoner is the victim of one of the worst miscarriages of justice in modern times and should have his conviction overturned , a former @entity1 mp argues in a compelling new book			0
@entity9 says that @entity12 , who has spent more than a quarter of a century in jail for shooting dead his adoptive parents , his sister and his two six - year - old nephews , has been the victim of ‘ questionable ’ police evidence			1
mr @entity9 , who has been working on the @entity12 case for the past ten years , says he has come across previously unconsidered evidence which suggests that the prosecution was seriously flawed			1
clue : @entity12 says this picture shows blood on his sister @entity23 's foot furthermore , the former @entity26 mp argues that recent revelations of police corruption – including the cover - up of the hillsborough stadium disaster and the controversy over the resignation of chief whip @entity33 and the ‘ @entity36 ’ row in @entity35 – reinforces his demand to take a completely fresh look at the case			1
@entity12 , now 52 , was convicted of the murders at the family ’s farm near @entity43 , @entity44 , in 1985 by a 10 - 2 majority jury verdict			1
he has strongly insisted on his innocence ever since – but until now has lacked such a high - profile public advocate of his case			2
@entity12 ( left , in 2002 ) has spent more than a quarter of a century in jail for shooting dead his adoptive parents , his sister and his two six - year - old nephews			1
he says his sister @entity23 ( right ) , who was a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic , suffered a psychotic episode and carried out the murders before turning the gun on herself @entity12 says his sister @entity23 , who was a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic , feared having her children taken into care , suffered a psychotic episode and carried out the murders before turning the gun on herself			1
but the police argued that @entity12 must have carried out the murders because the gun had been fitted with a silencer , which made it too long for her to be physically able to shoot herself			1
the police also said that if she had gone on a rampage her feet would have been covered in blood , which they said was not the case			1
now mr @entity9 says that after a 25 - year fight , @entity12 ’s lawyers have obtained a picture of the feet – which shows bloodstains			1
cold - blooded : @entity12 murdered his parents @entity76 and @entity78 ( left ) and sister @entity23 and her children @entity77 and @entity81 ( right ) and his defence team have also received new forensic results which suggest that burn marks on the back of @entity12 ’s father , @entity87 , had been made by the muzzle of a rifle without a silencer			1
in addition , his team say that even if the gun had been fitted with a silencer , it would have been possible for @entity23 to have shot herself			1
they have used an actress with the same length arms as @entity23 to demonstrate that she could still have reached the trigger			0
mr @entity9 says he has also unearthed evidence that the silencer produced as evidence in court had been claimed to have been found three days after the killings when , he alleges , it had actually been found nearly a month later			2
he believes that the alleged extra time could have been used to add ‘ scratch marks ’ on the silencer , to back up claims – later used by the prosecution – that @entity12 had been involved in a confrontation with his father while trying to carry out the killings , which had led to marks on both the silencer and a wall in the house			2
mr @entity9 argues that crime - scene photographs prove that additional scratches appeared on the wall in the days after the crime was committed			1
police had initially worked on the theory that @entity23 , a model known as ‘ @entity122 ’ , had been responsible			2
@entity12 , now 52 , was convicted of the murders at the family 's farm near @entity43 , @entity44 , in 1985 by a 10 - 2 majority jury verdict but they then put @entity12 at the centre of the investigation after his girlfriend , @entity130 – whom he had two - timed – claimed he had confessed to her his plans to hire a hitman to murder the family			1
she named the hitman , but he turned out to have a cast - iron alibi and was released			0
two years ago , @entity12 ’s legal team thought they had made a breakthrough when a recently unearthed police phone log recorded a call on the night of the killings from @entity76			1
the log , entitled ‘ daughter gone berserk ’ , said that mr @entity12 had said his daughter had stolen one of his guns and gone ‘ berserk ’			0
however , the @entity150 ( @entity150 ) declined to refer the case to the @entity152 – which has turned down @entity12 twice – saying that it had not identified any evidence that raised a possibility the court would overturn the conviction			2
@entity12 is the only one out of 38 prisoners in @entity158 and @entity159 serving a whole - life sentence who still protests his innocence			2
the case has caused unease in legal circles for years because the verdict was not unanimous and there was no direct forensic evidence linking him to the crime			0
the prosecution relied heavily on motive and character , arguing that @entity12 was ‘ greedy ’ and ‘ arrogant ’ , and had set up his sister to appear to be the culprit because he was motivated by the prospect of inheriting the £ 436,000 family fortune and considerable land			2
sentencing him to life imprisonment , the judge , mr justice @entity178 , described @entity12 as ‘ warped ’ and ‘ evil , almost beyond belief ’			0
now mr @entity9 , mp for @entity26 from 1983 to 2005 , argues in his book , @entity182 , that the evidence relied on by the prosecution was full of contradictions			0
he says that he expects the new forensics to form part of a third appeal attempt			0
‘ i think we are looking at one of the worst miscarriages of justice in recent times , and there is compelling evidence that much of the evidence provided by the police and others was unreliable , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’m afraid the police did dreadful things back then			0
do n’t forget the @entity200 and the @entity201			0
’ mr @entity9 , now 70 , was a classics teacher at @entity202 until entering @entity203 in 1983			0
as a right - wing member of the @entity205 , he does not fit the more usual left - wing profile of political critics of the police : in 2004 , shortly before stepping down from the @entity208 at the 2005 general election , he joined the @entity210			0
@entity12 was put at the centre of the investigation after his girlfriend , @entity130 ( both pictured ) , whom he had two - timed , claimed he had confessed to her his plans to hire a hitman to murder the family - a claim that was later proved false mr @entity9 first became interested in @entity12 ’s case while still serving as an mp , when he signed a @entity208 motion raising doubts about his conviction			1
@entity12 wrote to mr @entity9 to thank him , and the two men started corresponding frequently , with mr @entity9 paying visits to him in @entity226 prison in @entity227			2
campaigners working to free @entity12 have set up a website which includes regular blogs by the prisoner , based on letters written to his supporters by @entity12			0
in the most recent posting , on september 29 , @entity12 wrote : ‘ today is like all the others , as i wake in jail having completed 28 years wrongfully imprisoned			0
now i begin year 29 , a new day , a good day , one that none of us will ever see again			0
’ @entity12 hinted at mr @entity9 ’s findings in a june posting , saying : ‘ i wanted to write a short piece about all the work that has been done to resolve matters regarding my wrongful imprisonment , both in proving my innocence and in proving that @entity23 took her own life after killing our family			1
‘ we now have all the raw data that ’s key to resolving every aspect of the case , facts and figures extracted from three - and - a - half million pages of case documents			2
’ former @entity1 mp @entity9 ( above ) says @entity12 has been the victim of ' questionable ' police evidence @entity12 has kept a low profile in prison , apart from the time he was forced to defend himself with a broken bottle when a prisoner attacked him with a knife			1
he received 28 stitches on his neck following a second attack by another inmate			0
@entity12 was the son of a vicar ’s daughter who had an affair with a married @entity273 sergeant			2
he was adopted by @entity87 and @entity78 aged six weeks			0
privately educated , at the time of the murders he was just 24 and living in a cottage owned by his father three miles away			0
seven years ago he took and passed a lie - detector test			0
he has seen numerous therapists and psychiatrists in his time in prison , none of whom has suggested that he is mentally unstable			0
his legal team have also highlighted what they describe as other flaws in the original trial , including the fact that a bloodstained bible , found by @entity23 ’s side and open at pages containing @entity294 51 - 55 – a section relating to the struggle between good and evil – was never forensically examined nor produced at trial , despite repeated requests from @entity12 ’s solicitor			1
photographs also showed a handwritten note sticking up from between the pages of the @entity291 reading ‘ love one another ’ – the same words that were on a banner on a wall in a room in @entity309 when 909 people died in a mass murder - suicide			0
and it has emerged that shortly before her death , @entity23 ’s ex-husband , @entity313 , wrote to @entity87 expressing deep concern about her mental state and asking him to ‘ try and convince @entity23 that it would be better for her and the boys if they stayed with me most of the time ’			2
but when @entity12 told his trial that @entity23 had feared losing her children – which could have triggered one of her psychotic attacks – he was accused of making it up			1
last night , a spokesman for the @entity150 said : ‘ we have no current application in relation to mr @entity12 ’s case			1
’ a spokesman for @entity334 said : ‘ @entity334 has no comment to make on these claims given that @entity12 ’s conviction has been the subject of several appeals and reviews by the @entity150 and there has never been anything to suggest he was wrongly convicted			1

@entity12 , 52 , was convicted of murders of his adoptive parents , his sister @entity23 and his two six - year - old nephews in 1985
@entity12 says @entity23 , a paranoid schizophrenic , suffered psychotic episode and carried out murders before turning gun on herself
police say @entity12 committed crimes as gun was fitted with silencer , making it too long for her to shoot herself
police : if she *'d* gone on rampage her feet would have been covered in blood , which they said was not the case
ex-mp @entity9 : @entity12 ’s lawyers have picture of bloodstained feet
