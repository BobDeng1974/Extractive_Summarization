fans of @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 may be shocked to learn that unheralded striker @entity4 is currently one of the hottest properties in @entity7 's @entity6 with @entity8 where he has scored 12 goals in his last 18 matches			1
even more surprising is the @entity12 's views on the respective merits of the two leagues			1
contrary to popular belief , the 25 - year - old insists players in @entity7 are made to train harder than their @entity19 counterparts and that games are more intense and competitive in the @entity6			1
a few months ago , @entity23 's opinions might have been ridiculed but given the dismal performances of @entity26 clubs in @entity27 this season , it appears he may have a point			1
@entity4 is loving life in the @entity6 with @entity8 after stints with three @entity26 clubs the @entity12 striker moved to @entity26 with @entity1 but also played for @entity2 and @entity3 following @entity1 's exit against @entity36 , it is unlikely any @entity19 will be in the quarter - finals of the @entity38 , with @entity39 and @entity40 both losing their first leg matches at home			1
in contrast , @entity43 are safely through to the last eight with @entity46 and @entity47 having a great chance of joining them from the @entity6 next week			1
their fourth representative @entity50 gave @entity52 an almighty scare at the @entity54 before going out 5 - 4 on aggregate			0
' when i came to @entity7 , i thought it would be a little bit less intense than the @entity19 , ' admitted @entity4 , who signed for @entity8 on a @entity59 free following @entity3 's relegation in 2013			1
' but when i got here and felt the intensity , it was like “ wow ”			0
everything is fast just like in @entity26 but sometimes i feel there is more pressure here			2
in the @entity26 league , you have time to turn around and go against the defender face - to - face , but here it is always pressure , pressure , pressure			1
@entity23 says he thought it would be a little bit less intense than the @entity19 but he was surprised @entity23 says that after a career as a young player in the @entity19 he finds the @entity6 as intense ' the other thing that is different is the kind of training			1
here , we train twice - a - day two or three times a week			0
it was hard for me coming from @entity26 football where you sometimes have two days free in a week			2
' here it is impossible to do that			0
maybe you have one day off every two weeks			0
the philosophy is completely different			0
in @entity26 , they think your body needs to rest to be fit for the game , to get it in great condition			2
here it is the opposite , you have to train more			0
' sometimes it feels too much but you do feel stronger in key moments because you are training , training			0
when i was in @entity26 i would be a little bit more tired in the last 10 minutes			2
here i feel good , so maybe for my body it is better to train ! ' the reputation of the @entity19 has taken a nose - dive recently but @entity23 is not surprised our top clubs are n't able to dominate in the @entity38 and suggests there may be a snob value towards the @entity6 because of the dominance of @entity43			1
the 6ft 4in centre forward has 12 goals in his last 18 games as @entity8 rise up the @entity6 table ' i think @entity7 and @entity26 have the strongest two leagues but the big difference is the marketing			1
the @entity19 has 10 years more experience in that , ' he says			2
' on the pitch , the @entity19 is not better or quicker			2
' of course , @entity43 is by far the best team in @entity7 but it 's not because the other teams are s * * * , it is just because they very strong			1
' if @entity43 came into the @entity19 , they would finish top - three for sure and they could win it , why not ? they have @entity124 winners and players like ( @entity127 ) @entity126 , ( @entity129 ) @entity128 and ( @entity131 ) @entity130			1
@entity23 , modestly for his league , believes @entity43 would be in the @entity19 's top three the big striker took on @entity1 and their midfield giant @entity135 in pre-season			1
@entity8 won 3 - 1 ' just because some of the other teams in @entity7 are n't big names , it does n't mean they 're not good			1
' we played @entity1 in pre-season and beat them 3 - 1			2
ok , it was pre-season but @entity1 put out a good team and it was n't like they were able to score 10 against us			1
' @entity23 , a 6ft 4in centre forward , has packed a lot of experience into his short career			2
he left @entity151 for @entity152 very young and at 17 signed for @entity1 with a big reputation			2
it did n't quite happen for him at @entity155 and he failed to score a goal for them in two seasons			0
' i had to be realistic , i was competing against ( @entity161 ) @entity160 , ( @entity163 ) @entity162 , ( @entity165 ) @entity164 , ( @entity167 ) @entity166 and ( @entity169 ) @entity168 for a place and they were probably better than me at the time , ' he admits			2
' the most time i got was 45 minutes against @entity174 when @entity162 got injured			0
' the presence of @entity160 ( left ) , who is still @entity23 's friend , made it difficult for him to get game time @entity23 ( right ) says his loan to @entity2 went well at first but then he was dropped by @entity180 @entity4 has hailed his @entity12 international team - mate @entity181 as one of the top 10 players in the world			1
@entity185 has struggled in @entity26 , as @entity23 did , following a record £ 59.7million summer move to @entity188			1
but @entity4 insists : ' @entity185 did so well in the @entity124 for @entity151 , it was a shame he was injured for the final against @entity7 otherwise the outcome might have been different , for sure			2
' he is among the top 10 players in the world			2
his best position is on the wing , either right or left			0
he is quick and skilful but some players need more time to settle into a new league than others			2
' i 'd say ( @entity200 ) @entity200 and ( @entity201 ) @entity201 are on a different planet but after them , there are five or six of around the level – @entity206 , @entity126 , @entity207 , @entity208 – and @entity181			0
' he went on loan to @entity2			0
' i played every single game for a half a season and did really well , but did n't score - that was my big problem			0
i decided to stay another six months but then the manager @entity180 did n't play me any more			0
it was weird , from amazing to becoming very hard			0
but i did get a goal and assist in our local derby against @entity219 and they made a dvd of the match with my face on the cover ! ' ironically , it was @entity226 – now in charge of @entity26 's sole @entity229 survivors @entity230 – who helped start to turn his career around by signing him for @entity3 on a permanent basis in 2010			1
' it was my personal decision to leave @entity1 , i still had time on my contract but needed to play			0
@entity226 told me i was good enough to play for @entity151 , he gave me confidence			0
and he made me think about getting into the penalty area more			0
before then , i only wanted to score pretty goals , go past a lot of players			0
' now i realise if it comes off my knee , it still counts as one goal and that has helped me			0
' @entity3 won the @entity247 – @entity23 was an unused substitute - and were relegated in the same season , and @entity226 left for @entity230			1
he signed @entity249 , @entity250 , @entity251 and @entity252 – but not @entity253			0
' there is no problem with that , it would have been difficult to sign so many players from @entity3 , ' says the player			1
@entity2 fans mob @entity23 after he scored against @entity219 and it even earned him a space on a dvd cover @entity3 lifted the @entity247 at @entity263 before being relegated , although @entity23 did n't play a single minute instead , the forward – who won three caps for @entity151 during his time at the @entity267 – went to @entity8 in northern @entity7 and is finally fulfilling the promise everyone predicted in his teens			1
his winning goal against @entity271 last weekend lifted @entity8 up to eighth , just six points of a @entity38 berth			0
unfortunately a booking also means he is suspended for saturday 's big match against @entity43			1
he still keeps in touch with old @entity1 pals like @entity160 and @entity278 and friends from @entity3 like @entity250 and @entity280			1
he admits though that having not been ready for @entity26 football at 17 , he would fancy a return at some point to see how the intensity and hard work in the @entity287 have helped him develop			0
@entity3 owner @entity288 gets a champagne shower from @entity23 , but they would soon part company while @entity23 is enjoying the @entity6 , he says he fancies a shot at ' revenge ' in the @entity19 ' i am happy here really , i know i am in a league that is very competitive , one of the best in the world , ' he said			1
' in one way i am very happy here , i am doing well and playing in a very competitive league			0
but for the other side i would like to have my revenge in the @entity303 , show what i can do with the experience i now have			0
it may depend on @entity226 or other coaches what happens ! ' if i have to stay in @entity7 , i am going to be happy , and for the other side , if i have to go to @entity26 , i will try to do my best to show i am better than last time			0
' @entity23 still has friends in @entity26 from his time there and keeps contact with a few @entity1 players @entity23 faced top players in @entity26 but says @entity7 's lack of big names does n't make teams 's * * * '			1

@entity4 was not at his best with @entity1 , @entity2 or @entity3
but now he has 12 goals in 18 games with @entity8
@entity23 says the @entity6 clubs demand players to train harder
he says @entity43 would at least finish in @entity19 's top three
@entity160 and @entity278 are still in touch with the @entity12
striker wants to come back to have ' revenge on the @entity26 league '
@entity23 backs @entity181 to come good for @entity188
