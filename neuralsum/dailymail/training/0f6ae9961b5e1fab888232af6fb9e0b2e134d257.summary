@entity0 has made ' credible threats ' to kill @entity2 , a top @entity4 diplomat has warned just days before the @entity5 visits the mainly @entity7 nation of @entity8			1
@entity9 issued the stark warning today after @entity12 officials insisted there was no threat to his safety - and said he will not ride in the bulletproof ' popemobile ' of his predecessor @entity17			1
mr @entity9 , @entity4 's ambassador to the @entity18 , admitted he knew of no ' specific facts ' or ' operational projects ' but said : ' just put two and two together ... they want to kill the @entity2			1
public statements and crimes against @entity34 by @entity0 are a fact			0
just put two and two together			0
' but the @entity2 calls his bulletproof glass vehicle a ' sardine can ' beloved : the @entity2 pictured at a @entity38 to celebrate several weddings at @entity40 on sunday the ambassador said the spread of extremists across the world meant @entity2 is at risk anywhere - in @entity7 countries , on trips to @entity49 and the @entity50 and even in @entity51			1
he told the @entity53 newspaper @entity54 : ' threats against the @entity2 are credible			2
public statements and crimes against @entity34 by @entity0 are a fact			0
just put two and two together			0
' let me be clear , i am not aware of specific facts or operational projects			0
but what has been said by the self - declared " islamic state " terrorists is clear			0
they want to kill the @entity2			2
' i think they could try to hit him during his travels or even in @entity51 , because there are members of @entity0 who are not @entity68 but also @entity69 , @entity50 , @entity70 , @entity49 and @entity53			1
' this gang of criminals does not merely threaten			0
in @entity4 they have violated or destroyed some of the holiest sites of @entity76			2
they have hit places of worship in the @entity81 religion and @entity34			0
they forced 150,00 @entity83 to flee @entity84			0
' ' sardine can ' : an armoured popemobile was introduced after the 1981 assassination attempt on @entity88 ( pictured in @entity89 ) but @entity2 has said he dislikes the vehicle and would prefer not to use it outdated : pope @entity17 waves from the armoured vehicle in 2006 on a visit to @entity95 , @entity96			1
the @entity4 ambassador warned the current @entity5 is at risk everywhere - including in @entity49 and the @entity50 or even @entity51 the ambassador said the ethos of the terrorists was ' convert or be killed ' and described their murderous spread through @entity4 as a ' genocide '			1
but he added @entity83 could not be ' prisoners of fear ' and called on the @entity2 to send ' a message of hope to the @entity108 and around the world '			2
@entity4 ambassador to the @entity12 @entity30 said visits to the @entity49 and @entity50 would also be dangerous he added : ' with his wisdom and his courage could make this visit a bridge between our religions , a message of peace in the name of @entity121			1
' @entity4 had among the first @entity83 in the world , in the form of @entity124 who have faced centuries of persecution since			2
up to a million @entity83 are thought to have fled the country since @entity49 and @entity50 troops invaded in 2003 , with the violence of @entity0 militants triggering a new exodus			2
the terrorists follow an extremist interpretation of @entity134 , declaring @entity76 and @entity134 who refused to kill as sworn enemies			0
pope @entity2 will make a brief 11 - hour visit to @entity8 , more than half of whose citizens are @entity134 , this sunday to mark the rebirth of religion after @entity142 fell in the early 1990s			1
he will celebrate @entity38 in a square named for @entity8 's most famous @entity144 , @entity145 , in a bid to show how @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity76 now live in harmony in the country where @entity147 were once executed and sent to work camps			1
he is also due to visit @entity152 at the end of november			0
@entity53 newspapers have claimed security sources fear violent jihadis previously in @entity4 and @entity157 could return to their home countries and carry out an attack			1
@entity160 : the terrorists under the self - styled banner ' @entity163 ' have swept through @entity4 and @entity157 isolated : the militants have declared @entity83 , @entity81 people and even other @entity134 as their enemies but the @entity12 insisted security officials were ' calm ' about the visit this sunday			1
spokesman the @entity169 said the @entity2 will greet the crowds from the same open - top white car he uses in @entity25			1
it makes a striking change from the moving bulletproof glass booth which entered regular use after the assassination attempt on @entity88 in 1981			0
while his predecessor @entity17 regularly appeared behind the glass , the @entity5 ditched the ' sardine can ' vehicle in june after saying it kept him too far from the faithful			0
mr @entity169 said officials were concerned about @entity0 , but added : ' there are no specific threats or risks that would change the pope 's behaviour or the way the trip is organised			0
' the terrorists fight under the banners @entity163 in @entity4 and @entity157 ( @entity0 ) and @entity0 ( @entity0 ) - now calling themselves simply @entity163			2
they have swept through the @entity194 taking soldiers by surprise , killing thousands of people and recruiting hundreds of jihadis from western countries including @entity49 .			1
