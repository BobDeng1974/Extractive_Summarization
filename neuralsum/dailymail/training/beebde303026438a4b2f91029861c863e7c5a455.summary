however , as the day wore on it became clear that the press conference had been a publicity stunt , with his representatives saying he would not be leaving while the extradition order remained			0
his spokesman @entity145 said @entity2 had no intention of handing himself over to the police and could only leave if the @entity149 ‘ calls off the siege outside ’			2

claims he has been a *victim* ' detained ' in embassy and will leave ' soon '
cost of guarding the embassy has cost the taxpayer around £ 7million
