by @entity0 @entity1 is experiencing its worst drought since 1895 with no signs of it abating due to a stubborn ridge of high pressure that is lurking offshore and blocking typical winter weather			1
nearly four miles high and 2,000 miles long , it is to blame for the emerging drought as the mass of high air pressure has been blocking @entity13 winter storms from coming ashore and bringing much needed to bring rain to the parched @entity15			1
the duration of the upper - level ridge of high pressure anchored off its north coast - since december 2012 - is unprecedented in modern weather records and puzzling researchers			1
risk : one town on the northern coast has claimed it has fewer than 100 days of drinking water in storage			2
above , a warning sign on a dried - out beach at @entity29 a visitor explores the foundations of a wall in a mining town , known as @entity34 which has been submerged under @entity29 since 1955 which is now visible due to the water level drop in @entity29 cause : the dry conditions are believed to have been caused by a 2,000 - mile ridge of high pressure that is lurking offshore and blocking typical winter weather ' it 's like the @entity42 - a mountain range just sitting off the @entity15 -- only bigger , ' said @entity44 , a forecaster with the @entity45 in @entity46 , @entity1 told @entity48 - today @entity47 ' this ridge is sort of a mountain in the atmosphere			1
in most years , it comes and goes			2
this year it came and did n't go			2
' the current high - pressure ridge is even stronger and more persistent than a similar ridge that parked over the @entity13 during the 1976 - 77 drought , one of the worst in the 20th century			1
this ridge has persisted for 13 months and the longer it lingers , the less likely it is to leave , climatologist @entity63 , from the @entity64 in @entity65 , @entity59 told @entity66			1
this high pressure ridge system is feeding on itself , ' creating a sort of perfect environment for perpetuating the dry conditions ' it creates , he explained			1
concern : precipitation in most of the state less than 20 per cent of normal - leaving reservoir levels at record lows and prompting many cities to cut water usage @entity1 is under the influence of a persistent upper - level ridge of high pressure anchored off its north coast that has kept the region generally warm , dry and clear			1
nearly four miles high and 2,000 miles long , is to blame for the emerging drought as the mass of high air pressure has been blocking @entity13 winter storms from coming ashore and bringing much needed to bring rain to the parched @entity15			1
the mass of high air pressure has been blocking @entity13 winter storms from coming ashore in @entity1 , pushing them into @entity91 and @entity92 - it is even responsible for rain and cold weather to the @entity96			1
similar high - pressure zones pop up all the time during most winters , but they usually break down , allowing rain to get through to @entity1			1
the duration of its presence - 13 months - is unprecedented in modern weather records and puzzling researchers - it has been named the ' ridiculously resilient ridge			1
' source : @entity108 - @entity107 yesterday house speaker @entity109 visited a dusty @entity1 field joining @entity112 republicans to announce an emergency drought - relief bill to help farmers through what is certain to be a devastating year			1
if passed , the bill that 's already stirring controversy would temporarily halt restoration of the @entity119 designed to bring back the historic salmon flow , among other measures			2
farmers want that water diverted to their crops			2
standing on the field just outside of @entity126 , @entity109 said that where he 's from in @entity128 , the logic applied in @entity1 regarding water policy would cause people to shake their heads			0
' how you can favor fish over people is something people in my part of the world would never understand , ' @entity109 said			0
without the emergency legislation , thousands of farmworkers will be unemployed , he said			0
the bill is expected to be introduced in two weeks			0
it calls for allowing farmers to pump from the @entity145 as water permits and forms a @entity150 - @entity149 committee to tackle water troubles			2
@entity109 was joined by three @entity153 colleagues : rep. @entity154 of @entity155 , rep. @entity156 of @entity126 and rep. @entity157 of @entity158			0
the announcement followed gov. @entity161 's declaration on friday that @entity1 is suffering from a drought			2
@entity157 said @entity109 's visit draws the nation 's attention to @entity1 's dry weather			2
in turn , each lawmaker railed on @entity169 for failing to negotiate with them			0

restoration of the @entity119 has caused fierce battles spanning years that have pitted farmers in need of irrigation water against groups that wish to bring the salmon runs back to historic levels			0
' @entity207 , and families ( who ) depend on them , are the ones we need to act to save now , ' @entity205 , executive director of @entity206 , said in a statement			0
' @entity207 are dying in the drought - stricken @entity112 rivers and soon that will translate into lost jobs on the coast and inland waterways			1
' the @entity119 starts in the @entity218 east of @entity219 and collects at the @entity220 into @entity221			0
it flows a few miles after the dam but dries up before reaching the @entity13			2
the river resumes downstream with water from the @entity227 , @entity228 and @entity229 rivers , which each have salmon population			0
the river 's restoration is estimated to cost $ 1 billion in federal funds			0
among the difficulties , some former river bottom has subsided from pumping , and engineers will need to find ways to send the water uphill along its previous route			0
@entity242 may end up flooding			0
farmer @entity243 , who opened up his field to the congressional delegation , said the drought has caused his family to make the difficult decision to lay fallow 1,000 acres covered with producing almond trees and leave another 2,000 across of land unused			1
' water is a weapon , ' @entity243 said as his voice shook with emotion			0
' water is a hostage			0
our water system is battered and broken			0
it 's been hijacked by unreasonableness , and we need help			0

high pressure ridge lurking offshore and blocking the typical winter storms needed to drop rain along the @entity15
so far the ridge has been present for 13 months and the longer it last the less likely to it is to *disappear*
*scientists* have *nicknamed* the ridge of high pressure the ' ridiculously resilient ridge ' due to its 13 - month duration
the duration of its presence is unprecedented in modern weather records and puzzling researchers
nearly four miles high and 2,000 miles long , the mas of high pressure is to blame for the emerging drought
