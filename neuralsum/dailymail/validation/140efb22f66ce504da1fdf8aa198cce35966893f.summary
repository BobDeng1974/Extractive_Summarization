virtual reality gaming is coming ' this year , ' @entity1 's chief technology officer @entity0 has promised			1
the release date for the firm 's @entity5 headset has been shrouded in secrecy until now			1
he also said people would be able to game in @entity11 on ' something ' shipped by @entity5 - and said work was progressing well on @entity1 plan to build drones to give internet access to underdeveloped nations			1
' why is @entity11 going to work now , when it did n't work in the ' 80s and ' 90s ? ' asked @entity0			1
' because the technology is more advanced than before and ready for primetime , he said			2
' each one of these core tracks of technology had to hit a minimum core viability ... to get to that sense of presence to sense that you 're truly there			2
' ' you 're going to be able to do it in something shipped by @entity5 , ' @entity0 said			1
' this is going to be incredible			2
' ' @entity11 is more than just another platform , it can create a whole range of human experiences , ' said @entity59 , the chief scientist at @entity5			1
' @entity11 has the potential to change just about everything about the way we live			1
' he also reveald the firm thought drones were key to getting connectivity around the world			2
' this basically mean going to the sky , ' @entity0 says			2
he showed off the @entity71 , an @entity73 - connected unmanned drone with the wingspan of a 737 and the ' mass of a small car			2
' it would fly over regions of the developing world , sprinkling internet access like so much rain			2
the drones , flying at 65,000ft ( 19,800 metres ) , will be capable of staying in the air for months			2
they are relatively cheap and will be most effective for suburban areas that do not have the cables or infrastructure to carry internet or telephone signals			2
@entity90 , engineering director of @entity1 ’s @entity91 , has previously told the @entity92 that the planes will be ‘ roughly the size ’ of a @entity98 , but much lighter than the popular aeroplane , which weighs around 600,000lbs ( 272,155kg ) without passengers or fuel			1
@entity1 previously said the drones will be ' relatively cheap ' - although did not specify a cost - and will be most effective for suburban areas that do not have the cables or infrastructure to carry internet or telephone signals			1
@entity1 has revealed more details about its plans to provide web access to the world			1
drones as large as jumbo jets are set to extend the reach of @entity109 around the world			0
they will be powered by the sun and hover some 65,000 feet ( 19,800 metres ) above the ground the @entity114 - based tech giant has joined forces with @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 and other tech firms to develop the planes in an initiative called @entity122			0
today , around 2.7 billion people have access to the internet , which is just one third of the global population			0
the members of the initiative said in a report that connecting the world is ' one of the fundamental challenges of our time ' and they plan to do it using a variety of technologies , including drones			0

' they get to participate in the knowledge economy , ' the report said			0

yesterday @entity1 said it is to begin supporting virtual reality on its newsfeed , with users able to put on a @entity11 headset and explore a virtual location			1
the social network announced that users will be able to view videos filmed with multiple cameras , and move the viewpoint in order to explore a location			1
the innovation is being showcased at the firm 's @entity35 developers ' conference in @entity37 under the name @entity180 - a name that was leaked via an app notification this morning			0
the videos are shot with twenty - four cameras working in parallel			1
' you can move around inside the video , ' @entity187 said , ' and view it from different angles			0
' the company is demonstrating the new video format for attendees at this week 's @entity35 conference by showing off a 24 - camera - view of the @entity1 headquarters in @entity196 , @entity114			1
on a desktop computer , it is controlled by a mouse			0
however , the company describes its spherical videos as a ' first step ' toward even more immersive videos that we 'll view through virtual reality headsets like the @entity23 , which straps over your eyes and provide the illusion of stepping inside a digital environment			1
' you 're going to be able to put on your @entity5 headset , ' @entity187 said , ' and view spherical videos there too			1
' he also announced that users will soon be able to share content from third - party apps in their @entity1 's instant messaging service			1
@entity1 aims to use a mix of solar - powered aircraft and low - orbit satellites to beam signals carrying the internet to hard - to - reach locations			1
the drones , flying at 65,000ft ( 19,800 metres ) , will be capable of staying in the air for months			0
they are relatively cheap and will be most effective for suburban areas that do not have the cables or infrastructure to carry internet or telephone signals			0
the drones are effectively mobile phone masts in the sky and bounce smartphone communications between satellites and base stations on @entity160			0
low - orbit and geosynchronous satellites , which have orbits that match the @entity160 ’s rotation and are effectively stationary , will cover more remote areas in @entity244 and @entity245			0
the internet access would be transmitted in the form of free - space optical communication , or @entity249 , which transmits data using infrared laser beams			0
' one of the fastest growing and most important members of our family is messenger , ' said mr @entity187			0
' @entity1 used to be this single blue app and it did a lot of different things , now @entity1 is a family of apps , ' he said			1
' moving from being a single service to a family of apps is the biggest shift we 've made in our strategy in helping connect people			0
' the messenger platform was also launched , allowing developers to build new services into the app , which is used by 600 million users each month			2
mr @entity187 said it would give users ' more tools for expression '			2
the new platform will give users the chance to communicate directly with businesses , for example to change an order as well as track its delivery			2

mr @entity285 also spoke of @entity1 's desire to revolutionise online shopping by allowing users to receive real - time shopping updates via @entity256			1
this will start a message thread with the brand a user has shopped with , so they can track and alter an order via an instant message conversation			0
users can then send a thumbs - up to confirm an order			2
it will begin rolling out in the ' next few weeks ' , according to mr @entity285			0
' it 's time for us to reinvent how people and business communicate , ' he said			0

this is the idea that all a person 's smart devices can be connected together , enabling developers to create apps for @entity1 that can control part of the home			1
@entity1 is trying to mould its @entity256 app into a more versatile communications channel as smartphones create new ways for people to connect with friends and businesses beyond the walls of the company 's ubiquitous social network			1
to pull it off , @entity1 is opening messenger so outside programmers can build features tailored for the service			1
messenger will also be adding the ability to display store receipts and shipping information to help consumers keep track of their interactions with merchants and other businesses			0
@entity1 ceo @entity187 touted the @entity256 expansion wednesday during his opening speech at a two - day conference for developers in @entity37			1
