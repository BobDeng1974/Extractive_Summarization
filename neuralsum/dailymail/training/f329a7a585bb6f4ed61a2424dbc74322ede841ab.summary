by @entity0 published : 11:34 est , 5 july 2012 updated : 12:59 est , 5 july 2012 rallying residents have fought off controversial plans to build a gypsy site in the heart of an exclusive town which is home to a string of @entity8 footballers and soap stars			1
nearly 700 locals from @entity11 , @entity12 - whose homeowners include @entity15 boss sir @entity14 , @entity15 captain @entity16 , winger @entity17 and @entity18 stars @entity19 and @entity21 - made objections to the plans			1
a series of public meetings was held and @entity25 and townsfolk successfully argued that the application was far too vague and totally unsuitable for the area , a green belt site			0
nearly 700 objections were received against the planned traveller camp in @entity11 , @entity12 ( above ) many feared hundreds of travellers would flock there in scenes reminiscent of the site at @entity36 , @entity37 , which snowballed and became the largest traveller concentration in the @entity39			1
the group was finally evicted last year after a ten - year legal battle which cost an estimated £ 18million			1
the application for the @entity11 camp was submitted by @entity44 , which is run by former mp @entity45 - known as the ‘ @entity46 ’ for his work in getting planning permission on green belt sites			1
the proposal stated ' the stationing of caravans for residential purposes for 1 no. gypsy pitches together with the formation of additional hard standing and utility / dayrooms ancillary to that use '			0
but the submitted plans for the 0.46 hectare site were criticised for being unclear and many residents feared that many more caravans would occupy the site			1
@entity11 locals feared a repeat of @entity36 ( above ) , the largest traveller camp in the @entity39 , whose residents were evicted last year among those who live in @entity11 are @entity18 actor @entity19 ( left ) and @entity15 captain @entity16 ( right ) @entity71 councillor @entity70 told a meeting which was attended by about 100 residents that ‘ inappropriate development is harmful to the green belt and should not be approved , except in very special circumstances			1
' @entity78 ' sites , temporary or permanent , in the green belt are inappropriate development ’			0
resident @entity80 said : ‘ the general shortage of dwelling properties and current house prices is an ongoing problem to get our adult children buying into their own home locally ’			0
‘ i therefore object strongly to this proposed application and can only foresee turmoil for years to come in an established residential area			2
’ @entity92 said : ‘ the lessons of @entity36 should be learned			2
can @entity25 afford the millions of pounds that cost ? as a local taxpayer i do not want the council to take that chance			0
’ the result of @entity36 was a violent , decade - long saga that cost an estimated £ 18m and required a strong police presence during the eviction of @entity36 , protesters such as @entity103 ( pictured ) set fire to tyres and wood as barricades meanwhile , @entity109 said : ' the area surrounding this application is a quiet , established community with low crime rate which attracts visitors to use the adjoining countryside for walking , horse riding , exercising their pets , or where children play			2
' others visit to patronise local businesses or even to view the location of where the @entity124 man was discovered			0
' i believe that allowing the continuation of this application would have all the above negative effects on the area			0
' this objection is based on over 30 years ' personal experience as a serving police officer and having witnessed time and time again the effects on the community , environment and high rise in crime levels			0

nearly 700 residents of @entity11 , @entity12 object to the plans
many feared a repeat of the situation in @entity36 , @entity37 where the largest concentration of travellers in the @entity39 were evicted last year
