the performance of @entity1 on the last morning of the second test was one of the greatest i have seen from an @entity5 cricketer			1
he did everything right as a bowler , catcher and fielder			0
@entity5 must be doing something right behind the scenes if one of their players can produce something like that almost out of nothing			2
sessions that win matches do not happen purely by chance			0
when something like that happens it ’s very hard to adhere to the old mantra of not getting too up when things go well and not too low when they go badly			0
@entity5 captain @entity27 celebrates as he scores the runs to defeat @entity29 in the second test @entity27 ( left ) dives to his left to take a catch at first slip and claim the wicket of @entity35 @entity5 must remember that , having won a crucial toss , they had the best conditions against the eighth - ranked side in the world			1
but this was a win to savour			0
@entity1 may have won it with his extraordinary display but the key to me in @entity5 going one - up was the captaincy and batting of @entity27			1
there were times during the @entity50 when it was very clear who was leading @entity52 on the field but not so obvious who was in charge of @entity5			1
arms were being waved everywhere and , if you did not know @entity27 was the @entity5 captain , you would never have guessed it from watching them			1
yet now he looks completely in charge of this @entity5 team			2
whether it is because he has a young team or whether he has simply said , ‘ sod it , i ’ve taken a lot of criticism and now i ’m going to do it my way , ’ i do n’t know			0
but even on the fourth evening when @entity29 were only two down and the match looked destined to be a draw @entity27 was still impressive in the field			2
he seems to be on top of the big two senior bowlers in @entity1 and @entity76 , as was made clear in the first test when he had a little argument over fielding positions with @entity1 and very much got his own way			1
@entity1 ( left ) celebrates the dismissal of @entity29 batsman @entity82 @entity27 ( left ) celebrates with team - mate @entity83 ( right ) during the second test last week and it makes such a massive difference to the captain if he is scoring runs			1
everything becomes clearer and you do not have to fret over your place			0
ok , @entity27 has n’t scored that elusive century yet and the big test will come when he faces the moving ball again but for now his game looks in very good order again and he is making very good half - centuries			1
you have to say that it suits the way @entity5 play to be up against @entity29			2
@entity5 like to sit in , be patient and build pressure on a side			2
@entity29 are perfect for that because they are not coming at @entity5 in this series			0
@entity27 appears to have learnt from his mistakes			0
last summer , for instance , his decision to spread the field when @entity109 captain @entity108 was batting with the tail lost @entity5 the @entity112 but here he kept the field up to @entity114 in a similar situation and kept the pressure on			0
@entity27 ( right ) kicks the wicket in frustration after being dismissed for 13 runs against the @entity29 the test , of course , will come when @entity122 is flailing it to all parts at some point this summer and the wheels are coming off @entity1 and @entity76			1
that is when @entity27 will need to show the same presence and leadership			0
for now there is a lot for @entity27 and @entity5 to be pleased about , not least the batting of @entity133 and @entity83 who are breaking all sorts of records at such a young age			1
@entity83 may not always be easy on the eye but who cares ? he gets the job done			0
there is , of course , still work to be done and there is clearly a concern over @entity144 going into friday ’s third test			1
@entity144 was frenetic again at the start of his second innings , having looked much more like his old self as he spent time at the crease first time round			0
as i said before the second test , he needs to be given the whole of this series before @entity5 make a decision on him			2
if he can bring his old calmness to the start of his innings as an opener , @entity5 will have a very good player back in the side			1
but if he continues to be too frenetic in @entity160 then @entity5 might have to think again at the start of a huge summer when life will get much tougher .			0

@entity1 ****'s**** recent performance in the second test was one of the greatest i *'ve* ever seen from an @entity5 cricketer
however , @entity27 ****'s**** played an even bigger role in @entity5 ****'s**** *success*
@entity27 ****'s**** *battling* and captaincy *qualities* were clear to see throughout
elsewhere , @entity5 will have a very good player back on their hands if @entity144 can *regain* his old calmness going into the third test
