laying the ground for a return to management , @entity0 is keen to debunk some popular misconceptions			1
the first is that he could start a fight in an empty room			1
the second that he and his father @entity8 are bound together by an umbilical cord			1
in seven years at @entity10 — with a brief spell at @entity12 thrown in — @entity0 punched above his weight			1
laying the ground for a return to management , @entity0 is keen to debunk some misconceptions his departure , a mere four games into the season , owed more to a fraught relationship with chairman @entity22 than any concerns over his managerial ability			1
there were other minor spats as well ; with @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29			1
and , of course , with @entity31			1
sipping cappuccino in a coffee shop in @entity35 ’s @entity34 , @entity0 chuckles over the memories of a very contrived @entity38 rivalry			1
‘ i miss being on the touchline , ’ he admits			1
‘ i miss the pressure of going into a game			1
i quite enjoyed that aspect of it all			1
‘ @entity45 and i were arch rivals at @entity10 and @entity47 , but the truth is that we actually got on very well			1
‘ we fought our corner for our football clubs , sure			1
but it gave everybody a wee bit of interest in the @entity55			1
it gave it all a wee bit of razzmatazz and edge			1
‘ we had a go at each other in derby games			1
but look at the crowds since we left those clubs			1
we made that game an occasion			1
’ there was an infamous stand - off in march 2013			1
a goalless draw was enlivened by a touchline confrontation which , played out in @entity35 , would have finished in a @entity71 government summit			1
even now , images on @entity73 suggest the pair could hardly stand each other			1
@entity0 played down his rivalry with @entity31 , insisting the pair were actually good friends ‘ that ’s how we tried to portray it , ’ chuckles @entity0			1
‘ it was good for business			2
‘ we stoked up an atmosphere , a bit of aggro			2
‘ people thought we did n’t like each other			2
that we did n’t like each other ’s clubs			2
that it could all go off at any time			2
and because of that people came through the gates			2
’ if it was an act it was convincing			2
an @entity96 challenger to @entity97 for best performance in a @entity71 drama			2
‘ oh , we were good , ’ grins @entity0			1
‘ but go back to what ( renowned sports impresario ) @entity101 said a few weeks ago about @entity71 football			2
‘ there is not enough showmanship			2
not enough razzmatazz or whatever you want to call it			2
we have to sell the game and @entity45 and i did that			2
‘ what ’s the point of a club in the highlands having a dull manager ? ‘ there are plenty of them in football			2
people who only have someone else ’s opinions			2
‘ i tried to be different			2
i had an opinion and i gave it			2
i thought to myself : “ not everyone is going to like this ”			2
‘ i knew other clubs would n’t especially like what i was saying about them			2
‘ this wee upstart from @entity10 thinks because he beat @entity129 and @entity130 and @entity131 he can say what he likes ? they thought we should know our place			1
but @entity45 and i never accepted that			2
@entity0 watches a @entity10 training session with his father , @entity138 ‘ the reality is that i spoke to @entity45 just a couple of weeks ago			1
@entity45 has even helped me with some bits of my cv , for goodness sake			2
’ even so , reputations linger			2
opposition supporters , too , have formed a view of @entity0 as a nippy sweetie quite at odds with the intelligent , thoughtful man behind the panto persona			1
‘ i ’m probably a lot different on the pitch from how i am off it , ’ he ponders			2
‘ when it comes to saturday afternoon that ’s when it all comes			2
‘ but you can say a lot of successful managers are a bit hot to handle			0
’ famously , @entity0 refuses to swear or drink			1
in the civilised world this is normal behaviour			0
in @entity71 football it confuses people			0
‘ i have always been that way , ’ he says			0
‘ i can shout and bawl with the best of people , but i just do n’t feel i need to swear			0
‘ i never drank — it ’s the way i am			0
it ’s just me as a person			0
‘ i do n’t feel the need to apologise for it			0
people probably think if you do n’t swear and drink you ’re a bit different here			0
but i do make up for it in terms of anger , i suppose			0
’ there was anger over the way his departure from @entity10 happened			1
it was barely the end of september when , following months of tension over the direction the club was taking , @entity0 was fired			1
uniquely , the news came in a phonecall from his own father @entity8 , the director of football			0
‘ the chairman never actually spoke to me personally			0
he never phoned me , ’ says @entity0			1
then - @entity10 manager @entity0 celebrates after winning the @entity189 semi final at @entity190 ‘ i had to phone him to hear i had been sacked			1
for the service i had given the club over seven years i felt i deserved better than that			0
‘ my dad phoned me to say : “ listen , i ’ve had a meeting with the chairman			0
we ’re sacked and you have to phone him ”			0
’ ‘ i phoned him and he said : “ you ’ll have heard the news ”			0
we had a two - minute conversation and that was it			1
’ managers are sacked from football clubs every day			0
few hear the news from their own dad			0
at @entity10 , @entity0 and @entity8 worked closely together			1
yet after five months out of work the younger @entity0 dismisses the notion that they come as a package			1
that any club hiring @entity0 gets @entity8 as well			1
‘ there ’s no doubt that in @entity71 football that ’s what many people think , ’ he concedes			0
‘ that ’s simply not the case and never will be			0
‘ we did a fantastic job at @entity10 but we have to move on			1
he will take his path and i will take mine			0
‘ listen , i was always my own man			0
i picked the team , i decided which players came in			0
‘ i never used to tell my dad the team because it was none of his business			0
@entity0 revealed that @entity237 @entity236 gave him advice on how to deal with being out of a job ‘ working with your father is good and bad			1
it could be very intense at times			0
‘ we had spells where we had fall - outs on a weekly basis			1
‘ the second time round at @entity10 there were no more than a handful			1
‘ when your father is the director of football you speak to him in a way you might not speak to someone else			0
‘ there were things i would n’t share with him in a football sense simply because i wanted to try them my own way			0
now i am ready to do that on a more permanent basis			0
’ based on his record at @entity10 — he took an unfashionable club from the @entity71 highlands into the top six of the @entity264 and to a @entity189 final — @entity0 should be fending off suitors			1
yet , since ruling himself out of the running for @entity270 , the phone has hardly rung off the hook			0
@entity272 or @entity273 could do worse but , so far , have yet to make a call			0
others in the game have been more communicative			0
‘ i went to @entity278 last week and took in the @entity279 against @entity281 game , ’ he adds			0
‘ i then went up to @entity282 to take in their game with @entity237 and @entity236 very kindly agreed to meet me after the game for half an hour			1
‘ i went down to the changing room and spoke to him , to get a wee bit of advice and his take on how you deal with being out of the game			1
@entity0 managed @entity10 for six years over two different spells , first 2007 - 10 , then 2011 - 14 ‘ for him to take the time to speak and understand where i am and try to help was hugely appreciated			1
he had all that success at @entity298 and was really badly treated at @entity299 and did n’t get the time to move on			0
‘ he said to me : “ get around clubs , speak to people , watch teams training and their methods ”			0
’ ‘ so after that i went down to @entity305 and i watched @entity306 , @entity307 and @entity309 training			0
@entity310 were there as well			0
‘ by coincidence so was @entity312			0
he was staying in my hotel having lunch with friends when i walked in			0
‘ he said to me : “ any chance of me coming along to training with you ? ”			0
i was glad of the company and ended up taking him to training sessions and games			0
‘ i picked his brain as well			0
how can you not ? it ’s great to learn from the older generation and taking advice from people who have been there			1
’ he plays some golf and has dabbled in the media			0
but , at 39 , @entity0 knows he ca n’t pick or choose his next gig			1
he does n’t have the luxury			0
‘ if you have the hunger and desire — and i do — you hope people will recognise that			0
i ’ve had plenty of leisure time			0
it ’s time to get back to work			0

@entity0 has been out of a job since leaving @entity10
despite his *impressive* record there he has struggled for employment
@entity0 also opened up about his relationship with @entity31
the 39 - year - old revealed @entity236 offered advice on finding a new job
