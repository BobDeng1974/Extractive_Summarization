and now the 54 - year - old doll 's most ardent admirers have somewhere really special to sate their rumbling tummies : @entity11 's newly opened @entity10			1
the hot - pink diner licensed by @entity13 - the @entity14 toy - maker who created @entity2 , @entity16 and all their plastic pals - has opened its garish doors in @entity19 , the capital city of @entity11 and the place where @entity2 were originally manufactured until production was relocated to @entity22 in the 1960s for financial reasons			1
its interior is heaped with hot - pink sofas , neon pink tables shaped like stilleto heels , chairs decorated with fuzzy pink tutus and red corsets and illustrations of @entity2 herself in a number of different outfits			2
staff wear bright pink @entity2 logo t - shirts , pink tutus , @entity2 armbands and sparkly tiaras			1
@entity13 's aim is for the dolly - themed eatery to boost the @entity2 label as a fashion brand			1
similar versions of the waitresses ' uniforms are available on the @entity13 website , and lines even include tutus for toddlers			0
think pink : staff at the restaurant wear bright pink @entity2 t - shirts , @entity2 sticker armbands and stick - on face gems sticky and sweet : a @entity2 - themed cake , left , and a plate of garish macaroons and @entity2 dessert buns , right @entity75 , a senior manager at @entity13 's @entity22 division , said : ' we picked @entity11 because theme restaurants are very popular and successful here			1
' we are very confident that the @entity10 can promote our brand image			0
' it is hoped the caf√© will attract @entity2 fans from @entity22 , @entity83 and @entity84			0
@entity11 used to manufacture the @entity2 dolls until the 1980s , when @entity13 moved its production lines to @entity22			0
hot pink palace : illustrations of @entity2 deck the walls at the cafe , and the dining chairs are all made to look like ballerinas with red corsets and pink tutus ballet @entity2 : chairs in the @entity2 restaurant have red corset backs and fuzzy pink tutus local office worker @entity100 , who has a five - year - old daughter , approved of the new diner			1
she said : ' my child and i both love @entity2 and this lovely and cute place is like a dream come true for us			0
i will take her here to celebrate her next birthday			0
' but @entity109 , editor of feminist website @entity111 , told the @entity112 : ' i can not imagine anything less pleasant and more nausea - inducing than a @entity2 themed restaurant			2
' not only because i prefer low - impact environments and none of the major food groups are pink for a reason , but also because @entity2 is an outdated model of stereotypical femininity and needs to die a death			2
' @entity13 launched a @entity2 concept store and eatery in @entity22 in 2009 when it celebrated the doll 's 50th birthday , but it was closed down after two years after failing to get off the ground			0
