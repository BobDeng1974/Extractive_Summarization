by @entity0 follow @ @ samcunningham @entity1 has demanded that @entity2 crack down hard on @entity3 for breaching financial fair play rules			1
@entity3 were found to have violated @entity6 regulations — the rules set up to stop clubs spending more than they earn — and it is expected they will have their wage bill cut for their @entity13 squad next season			1
and @entity1 said he will feel ‘ let down ’ if @entity2 do not severely punish @entity3 and has called on the authorities to take serious action			1
‘ there are rules to apply for financial fair play , ’ said @entity1 , whose club posted a £ 6.7m profit earlier this year			2
‘ if you do n’t respect them , you have to apply the rules			0
scroll down to watch @entity1 say any team could drop points strong : @entity1 insisted that @entity2 must punish clubs who break the financial rules big - spenders : but @entity31 has rejected those claims for his ' over-spending ' team ‘ one of the rules is that normally you should be banned for the excess of the financial amount that is not justified , that is if you are £ 100m overboard , you should be punished for £ 100m of your wages bill in the @entity13			1
‘ i want to see that respected , if that is not respected , then the financial fair play will have problems to be respected in the future because everyone will just not consider it at all			2
‘ if it is not respected , of course we will feel let down			2
’ there were initial suggestions that clubs could be banned from the @entity13 if they broke the new rules , but @entity1 believes @entity2 have back - tracked on that so they do not risk jeopardising money from tv rights , especially since @entity59 have also violated @entity6 rules			1
money man : @entity62 has ploughed millions of pounds into @entity3 in search of glory over-spent : @entity1 suggested that @entity67 tv would be unhappy if @entity59 were not in the @entity13 he added : ‘ that has gone now , i have thought about that problem and the media might play a part in that , because when @entity2 sells the rights of the @entity13 to a @entity67 tv station , it is very difficult to explain to them once they have paid the money that the best club in their country will not play in the competition , so that might be one of the reasons behind that			1
’ in order that @entity84 stay within the financial rules , @entity1 maintains that he will not be making huge changes to his squad			1
the 64 - year - old will bring in two or three players in the summer , but is confident they have the nucleus to make minimal transfers in order to catch up with the top three			0
‘ it will be busy but the main thing for us will be to keep the stability because we feel we are close , we want to add something that makes us even stronger , ’ he explained			0
‘ but number-wise it will not be massive			0
‘ at the moment i have people around me who start to look			0
‘ from my experience the @entity102 years have always been very quiet until @entity104 , with no players reachable			0
‘ everybody is focused in the country on their national team and there ’s not a lot happening , people are away			0
‘ i believe this year again you will have to wait until the july 15 to start going			0
