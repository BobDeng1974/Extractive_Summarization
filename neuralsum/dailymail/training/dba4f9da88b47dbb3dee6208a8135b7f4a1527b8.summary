he was the @entity1 's favourite tv star , loved by millions who tuned into @entity3 'll fix it each week , before being exposed as a predatory paedophile following his death in 2011			1
now @entity8 's nephew @entity7 , 60 , has revealed that he came within a whisker of being sexually abused himself but was inadvertently saved by his uncle			1
in 1968 , aged 15 , he and a group of friends ran away and got the train to @entity14 where they were met by two men who invited them back to their flat			1
' i would have said about 30 , rock and roll , with leather jackets and long hair and that , ' he remembers			2
' and they said : " do you want to come to our place and that ? " you ’ve got to try to remember that there were no such thing as perverts			2
' there was but you did n’t hear of them			2
there were n’t even a name " paedophile " out then i do n’t think			2
' so we just thought oh they like us , you know			2
so anyway we ended up going with these back to their flat			2
' four days later , @entity7 's uncle @entity54 arrived at the flat with a group of young children and a vicar in tow			1
@entity7 , thinking his uncle had been asked to find him by his family , was horrified			1
' i thought that me @entity54 had caught me there , ' he says			2
' i was proper scared , i was terrified if you want			2
but now i ’m 60 , i think he did n’t catch me i caught him			2
' @entity7 , who tells his story on tv documentary crimes that shook @entity67 , says he has since worked out what was really going on			1
' these people would pick people up from train stations , as in younger people , ' he explains			0
' we ’d then go to their houses			0
' and then the ones higher up the chain would come to these houses to see who they ’d picked up to take them elsewhere to do whatever they were going to do with them			0
' because his uncle was @entity8 , @entity7 thinks word quickly spread that this was one child not to be touched			1
' when i think back i cringe because i think you could have ended up in the bottom of the @entity88 , ' he confesses			0
' i think it ’s only because i was , you know , @entity8 ’s nephew , my @entity54 ’s nephew , that nothing like that did happen			1
' others , however , were not so lucky			0
by the time @entity8 died aged 84 in october 2011 , his victims were estimated to number more than 450			1
@entity7 , who has written a book about his experiences , is all too well aware of what went on and says he saw the disgraced star with children during parties at his home			1
' i had no conception of paedophilia or child abuse or anything , ' says @entity7 , who lived with his uncle for a few months when he was 15 along with three friends			1
' neither had any of the other three			0
so to us , our thoughts were , it ’s a party			0
you know the people who live there			0
' it ended up where we were like huddled together , four of us , and then these little kids would come over to us			0
' popular : thanks to the success of shows like @entity3 'll fix it , @entity8 was once loved by millions of ordinary @entity123 peverted : after his death in 2011 , @entity8 was exposed as a paedophile with at least 450 victims although @entity7 was unaware of what was happening to the children at the time , he regularly saw @entity8 wander past with groups of children in tow			1
' my @entity54 did n’t even speak to us or acknowledge us , although every now and again you might have got a nod			0
' he just seemed to come in , flitter about , you know whatever he were doing - bringing little’uns in and stuff like that and then he ’d go			0
' i ’ve recently found out that i were going to get " groomed " to do what the people down @entity14 were doing - getting the kids and probably older girls and older boys to go to these parties up here in @entity150 and places like that			1
' ' i think most decent people find it incomprehensible that these , sort of , organisations , rings , whatever we want to call them exist but no less incomprehensible than why would anybody abuse a child , ' comments @entity160 , chief executive of the @entity161 in @entity162			0
' the fact that people come together to do it seems in a way somewhat more scary because very often we ’re talking about people from all walks of life , including those from the upper echelons of society			0
' by the end of the year , @entity7 had returned to @entity150 , far from his paedophile uncle , and was separated from him further courtesy of a spell in @entity177			1
when he emerged , it was as a young man ready to start a career and begin a family , both of which he later did			0
although he became close to his uncle in later life , even giving a gushing tribute when he died , @entity7 says he was n't surprised to hear of his uncle 's crimes			1
‘ although i was n't sexually abused i do feel like a victim myself , ' he adds			0
' i think i should have reported him years ago but i was too scared to do it			0
now i am really pleased everyone knows the truth			0
' crimes that @entity67 starts on sunday 17 august at 9pm on @entity195			1

@entity7 , now 60 , was ensnared by a paedophile ring aged 15
was only saved because abusers were part of same ring as @entity8
later found out that he was being ' groomed ' to become a *procurer*
