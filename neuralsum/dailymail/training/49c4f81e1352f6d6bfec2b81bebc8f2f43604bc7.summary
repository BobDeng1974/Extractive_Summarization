after a few nights staying in a hotel , eating out every night or paying extortionate prices for room service can become tiresome			1
and sometimes , you just want to whip up an easy dinner yourself			2
@entity6 , a frequent hotel guest around the world , discovered that it is possible to cook a three - course meal using just the objects found inside a standard budget hotel room			1
the @entity13 comedian has used a trouser press , iron , hairdryer , waste bin , electric towel rail and kettle as cooking tools for his in - room dining			2
' i 've been performing on the stand - up circuit for the last 20 years , ' he said			0
' i 'm really into cooking but often i stay in soulless budget hotels where they serve over-priced and not very good food			1
' i would rather cook my own , so i started experimenting and seeing what i could rustle up in my room			0
there are various ways of heating and cooking things , using just the stuff you find in there			0
' i started out doing pretty basic dishes			0
now i can do quite advanced stuff , like making ice cream			0
' @entity51 : the comedian uses just the equipment found inside a budget hotel room to make his food - like toasting muffins on an iron five years ago , @entity6 made short films of hotel room cookery demos as he travelled the world - and they went viral on @entity62			1
now , he 's taking his unique brand of cooking show on the road in a @entity13 tour			1
' it 's an hour of stand - up and storytelling about my exploits , while i simultaneously make a starter , a main and a dessert , ' he said			1
' the food is actually very good and the audience are welcome to eat the dishes , though i always stress it 's " at your own risk "			0
' i have made pancakes , poached fish and ricotta out of those little cartons of @entity85 milk			0
hotel - cooked meal : @entity6 has made pancakes , ice cream , tiramisu , fish and pastas ' i have found two ways to make ice - cream			1
one that does n't work , i discovered , involves a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher			0
the other , which does work , involves the nifty use of the ice machine in the corridors of hotels			0
' you can use a heated towel rail to make beef jerky , by drying strips of brined meat on it			2
' hotel kettles are tiny but you can poach a sea bass if you cut it into four fillets			2
i add fennel seeds , too , and make a nice salsa verde			2
' i think " this would cost me Â£ 18 in the restaurant downstairs , and i 've done it in my room without a kitchen "			0
' clever : in this @entity62 video , the 41 - year - old made pasta by boiling it in the hotel room kettle @entity6 is playing the @entity124 , @entity125 , on october 5 , where he will perform his cookery show			1
he said : ' i like playing @entity125			1
. i grew up in @entity127 and live in @entity128 now , but my parents met while at teacher training college in @entity125			1
' and , of course , with my name i 'm a fan of mr egg the greasy spoon			0
' on stage with me in @entity136 i have an iron , kettle , minibar and trouser press , plus towels and sachets of sugar and milk			1
unique show : @entity6 is now taking his skills on the road in a one - man show , @entity136 , at the @entity124 in @entity125 ' with a kettle you can steam , poach and boil ; with an iron you can fry and toast			1
' i 'm particularly proud of the ice - cream invention			0
i 've even made a tiramisu using only the free ingredients provided by the hotel , including milk , biscuits , sugar and coffee			2
' i am very stealthy and have never had any complaints from hotels , and i always clean up after myself			0
