by @entity1 reporter published : 00:47 est , 27 november 2013 updated : 17:59 est , 27 november 2013 the amazing story of how a struggling army recruit emerged to play a key role in tracking down @entity5 reads like a @entity7 movie script , and that ’s exactly what @entity10 ’s life story is soon to become			1
as a military interrogator in the @entity14 backwater of @entity15 , @entity10 was forced to develop his own methods of getting information from the locals after the techniques he ’d learned in the army failed miserably			1
but by going against what the military had taught him , @entity10 secured the ultimate success and got the information that led @entity27 troops to capture @entity5 in december 2003			1
the story of how struggling army recruit @entity10 from @entity30 emerged as a key player in tracking down @entity5 reads like a @entity7 movie script it was all a very long way from @entity10 ’s inauspicious starts as a struggling new recruit some ten years before			1
after graduating from the @entity36 in 1994 , @entity10 claims that a voice from @entity38 told him to become an army @entity40 , even though he 'd never shot a gun and was terrified of heights			1
‘ every day of @entity44 , i was like , “ are you sure ? ” - i barely passed , ’ @entity10 recently recalled to @entity43			2
next he decided to become an army interrogator after someone convinced him that it would be an easy ride			1
in @entity51 : blacklist , due out next year , @entity52 will play @entity10 in the improbable story of how he tracked down @entity5 in 2003 @entity10 said , ‘ they told me , “ be an interrogator			1
that 's the easiest one			0
it 's eight weeks of training			0
you 'll never have to do it			0
we do n't have any prisoners "			0
' but then came the events of september 11 , 2001 and everything changed			0
@entity27 forces invaded @entity14 in march 2003 and @entity10 was sent to @entity15 , @entity5 's hometown , to interrogate prisoners who were captured on raids by @entity70 teams			1
@entity10 admits he failed miserably when he first started			2
he said : ' the really scary part was when i realized not only had i not done an interrogation but , when i started doing them , they did n't work			0
' fortunately , @entity15 was considered a backwater and so he was left to develop his own technique			0
' it was the best thing that happened to me because there were no expectations , ' @entity10 said			1
' i could figure out how to get the prisoners to talk without torturing them			0
' @entity10 soon discovered that he his technique also worked			2
he had a natural ability for taking tiny bits of information from hundreds of prisoners and being able to piece it together to reveal the bigger picture			0
he said : ' i went to the team leader and made a pitch - " i know this sounds crazy , but i think i have a path that , if we follow , might possibly lead us to @entity95 [ @entity5 ] "			2
' rather than focusing on high - profile targets , @entity10 spoke with bodyguards , chauffeurs and shopkeepers and slowly more of the bigger picture emerged			0
then just as he was due to leave for @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity10 finally came face - to - face with his @entity103 - a personal bodyguard of @entity5			1
with only two hours to convince the bodyguard to talk before he had to leave for the airport , @entity10 told him to ' beat on his cell ' if he decided to change his mind and talk			2
the scene where @entity27 troops captured ousted @entity14 president @entity5 in december 2003 , it was vital information found out by @entity10 that lead to @entity5 's capture he said : ' as i 'm driving to the airplane to leave the country , they told me , " that prisoner			1
what did you do ? he 's going crazy , beating the heck out of his cell in there "			0
' @entity10 got the prisoner to sketch a map detailing @entity5 's location , which lead to his historic capture			1
@entity10 said : ' it took me several years to come to the conclusion i was n't going to wake up from a dream			2
' he now lives in @entity132 and continues to work for the @entity133			0
a couple of years ago he wrote a book that a movie studio immediately bought the rights to			0
mission : blacklist is currently in pre-production , with @entity52 set to play @entity10			1
it is expected to be released next year .			0

@entity10 is the army interrogator who uncovered vital information that lead to the capture of @entity5
his life story is being turned into a @entity7 movie , due out next year and starring @entity52
@entity10 only *joined* the army after a voice from @entity38 told him to back in 1994
when army interrogating techniques did n't have any success in @entity14 he was left to do his own thing and he got *extremely* *impressive* results
