at two years old , @entity0 is too young to realise just how incredibly dear he is to his parents			1
he knows they love him			0
but it will be some time before he comprehends just how much money – and heartache – they invested during the four years they spent trying to have him			2
his mother @entity9 had been told by an @entity11 specialist she would never conceive with her own eggs after blood tests showed she was perimenopausal , meaning she was heading for early menopause			1
happy mum : @entity9 , 38 , and her husband @entity17 , 42 , from @entity18 , had son @entity19 , pictured aged six months , after several rounds of @entity21 and alternative treatments costing £ 60,000 but after she endured two failed rounds of @entity21 at a private clinic , and countless alternative therapies , @entity19 was finally conceived after a third round of @entity21			1
by then his parents had spent more than £ 60,000 ensuring his arrival			2
he was born on march 26 , 2012 , weighing 9lb 3oz			1
their struggle to become parents has left @entity31 , a recruitment manager , and her husband @entity17 , an it manager , around £ 20,000 in debt			1
but @entity19 is worth every penny to them			1
@entity31 , 38 , said : ‘ every day i think how lucky i am to have had my own biological child			2
it ’s such a massive thing for me			0
’ the couple , from @entity18 , began trying for a baby soon after marrying			0
mr @entity0 has a daughter , @entity41 , now 13 , from a previous relationship but they wanted a child together too			0
price for joy : @entity19 , pictured recently , was finally conceived after a third round of @entity21 , leaving ms @entity9 , and mr @entity0 around £ 20,000 in debt if the woman is under 35 , doctors usually tell couples they can not have tests until they have tried for 12 months without success to become pregnant			1
but after only three months @entity31 , who was 32 at the time , and her husband went to their gp in 2008			2
‘ i lied and said we ’d been trying for a year , ’ she said			2
it was then that blood tests showed she was heading for early menopause and her only hope was donor eggs or adoption			0
but she refused to give up hope and threw herself into researching fertility			0
after making appointments with a private fertility clinic and a @entity69 medicine practitioner , she replaced alcohol , sugar , caffeine and carbohydrates with wheatgrass shots and maca powder , a supplement made from a @entity78 root which is purported to boost energy			0
she also tried acupuncture , reflexology , yoga and pilates			0
then came the two unsuccessful rounds of @entity21 , using her eggs and her husband ’s sperm , both in 2009			1
failing to become pregnant was heartbreaking , but @entity31 was determined to try again and found a clinic in @entity89 with a different – and more expensive – approach involving more extensive tests			0
she had to get up at 4.45am to travel to @entity89 for daily blood tests before heading back to work , and had 14 days of hormone injections before two embryos were put back into her womb			0
the day before she was due to have a pregnancy blood test at the clinic , her husband , now 42 , convinced her to take a home pregnancy test			1
‘ i was too nervous to look at it so i handed it to @entity17			1
when his face lit up i knew it was positive , ’ she said			0
as for the alternative therapies , she is sceptical about how much they helped her to conceive , but says they gave her a psychological boost			2
she also ordered the controversial drug dhea , a hormone supplement which is thought to boost oestrogen levels , off the internet , but says it gave her boils on her face , chest and back			0
the couple used bonuses , overdrafts and credit cards , plus help from her parents , to pay for the ever rising cost of having @entity19			1
since his birth , they have tried for another child and @entity31 has had two more rounds of @entity21 , costing £ 10,000 each , boosting their pregnancy bill to a total of £ 83,200 .			1

@entity9 , 38 , and her husband @entity17 , 42 , had son @entity19 in 2012
the two **-** year **-** old was born after four years of @entity21 attempts and therapies
*including* two @entity21 round for a *sibling* , total ' pregnancy bill ' is £ *80,000*
