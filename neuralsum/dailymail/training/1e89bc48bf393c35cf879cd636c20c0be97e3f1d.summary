@entity0 , an entrepreneur from @entity11 who was raised @entity12 but is now an atheist , has successfully created two @entity6 @entity5 apps			1
after launching the apps and raking in an annual revenue of $ 100,134 , he has begun questioning his morality over selling the religious book he does not believe in			2
@entity0 attended a @entity12 college and was also married in a mormon temple , but he eventually left the church , according to @entity22			1
he said that he does not believe in @entity23 or the @entity5 , and likened him selling the apps to someone selling @entity26 and telling people it was real			2
' what if you sold @entity26 books or @entity32 books , but you told people it was real ? , ' he said in a podcast interview with @entity37			0
' and you told people if they would just learn how to write spells themselves , they could heal their children ? ' and if you sold that as a real thing ? i would feel terrible about that			0
' but that 's really the situation i am in selling the @entity5			2
i am selling this thing i truly believe is fiction			0
' @entity0 , who successfully launched the audio version of the app , @entity51 ( left ) , said he battles with the notion of selling the religious book he does not believe in			1

@entity0 came up with the idea in 2012 as a way to pay his $ 600 rent and realized that there were a few @entity6 @entity5 apps that were terrible			1
since creating the apps , he said he has received emails from customers asking for prayer as they think he is a preacher			0
@entity0 said : ' if you 're emailing the maker of an app to get help for your son , you 're probably not a in a great spot			0
trading that for profit weighs on me a little bit			0
