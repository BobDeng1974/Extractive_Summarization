rookie full backs @entity0 and @entity3 offered an encouraging glimpse into the future by playing an important part in breaking down @entity7 at @entity8			1
with no @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 on show , it was left to the newer generation to shine			2
and they made light of the fact they only had four caps between them before the game – compared to the 180 won in total by the aforementioned trio			0
videos scroll down to watch @entity0 was comfortable in his own half and a threat going forward for @entity27 @entity27 defender @entity3 also impressed against @entity7 after stepping in for @entity10 @entity0 and @entity3 are thoroughly modern full backs ; quick , mobile and equally comfortable in either half of the pitch			1
they did n't lack in confidence either			0
@entity0 , 23 , was first to impress on his international debut			0
during a turgid opening 45 minutes , he was @entity27 's brightest attacking hope , one attacking burst left his marker flat - footed down the right - hand side led to a good chance for @entity41 @entity3 takes exception to a decision from the referee of @entity27 looks dejected @entity0 found himself regularly fending off @entity7 's @entity45 ( right ) @entity0 is a cool customer , his development in south @entity47 at @entity48 was a tough schooling and he has progressed nicely on the south coast at @entity51 , who sit second in the @entity53			1
given the nod ahead of @entity56 youngster @entity55 , @entity0 took up advanced positions early on , always available to playmaker @entity58 , and there was encouraging inter-play with @entity61 down the right - hand side			2
@entity3 of @entity63 took longer to settle but can look back on the game with equal satisfaction , despite being @entity27 's only player in the book for catching @entity68 down the back of the leg as the @entity71 tried to shield the ball			2
@entity0 ( right ) gets physical with @entity71 midfielder @entity45 after getting the nod ahead of @entity55 @entity0 clears without fuss under pressure from @entity7 's @entity45 to show his resolve , @entity3 responded immediately by winning the ball back and forcing a corner that led to @entity80 's header being saved by @entity81			1
after @entity27 levelled , @entity3 – who will face long - term competition from @entity10 and @entity84 teenager @entity83 for his place – seemed to get forward even more			1
and he played an important part between @entity87 and @entity41 to help set up @entity27 's best goal of the evening , @entity61 's third in a 3 - 1 victory			1
for so long , @entity27 were sluggish against @entity7			0
if anything it was the energy of the two inexperienced defenders that kept them going through a difficult period			0
one senses @entity0 and @entity3 will be given another chance by @entity98 , maybe in @entity99 on tuesday , though @entity83 is also available for that one			2
@entity0 ( front row centre ) and @entity3 ( front row right ) take their place in the starting 11 's team photo @entity10 was forced out of the side due to an injury picked up in @entity27 training @entity27 boss @entity98 was more than satisfied with the young duo 's performance			1
' i thought @entity0 was excellent in his first game , ' said @entity98 after the 3 - 1 win			1
' he and @entity3 did well , particularly as @entity3 only got his call to play quite late because @entity10 was going to be in the team			0
' the two of them played high up the field like we wanted them to and they defended very solidly			0
' @entity0 has to be delighted with his debut and he and @entity61 would have challenged @entity58 for his man of the match			0
but i thought @entity58 was outstanding			0
