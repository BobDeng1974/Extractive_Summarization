ordinary @entity1 tennis fans face a @entity3 - type scramble for @entity5 quarter - final tickets this summer and are likely to end up with less than half the overall allocation			1
there will be a capacity of 7,000 for july 's match against @entity10 at @entity12 's @entity11 , but well under 3,000 tickets may be available to the kind of supporters who created such an electric atmosphere in @entity17 for last month 's first round			1
the rest will go to various organisations and governing bodies , with a considerable percentage going to well - heeled @entity24 's members as part of the deal to play the tie there			1
@entity1 tennis fans face a @entity3 - type scramble for @entity5 quarter - final tickets this summer @entity33 enjoys a spot of @entity36 action alongside his friend @entity37 at the @entity38 the @entity39 acceded to the wishes of @entity33 and gb captain @entity41 to play the tie on grass , which they feel best enhances their chances in what is a first @entity5 quarter final staged at home in 29 years			1
that very much narrowed down the choice of venues for the tie that begins just five days after @entity3			2
the @entity52 was never an option due to the stress the grass courts take during @entity3 and ongoing development work there			0
a by - product is that tickets are likely to be as scarce as they are for the big fortnight			2
sponsors plus organisations such as the @entity39 , @entity3 , the @entity63 and the @entity64 have to be catered for			2
@entity24 's members will also have a considerable allocation as the tie means the stands there being up nearly all summer , with the @entity70 taking place in the middle of june as the main warm - up for @entity74			1
@entity33 has an affinity for @entity11 , having won the @entity70 title there three times @entity33 is currently practicing in @entity79 before beginning his clay court campaign later this year the above will have until may 27 to take up or return their tickets , with only around 2,500 guaranteed to reach the ordinary public			1
a minimum 2,000 per day will then go on sale to those who are @entity86 – something that anyone can become by joining free – while at least 500 will go to supporters who have travelled abroad in recent years to support the @entity1 team			0
' we have obligations to certain groups within the tennis family , ' said an @entity39 spokesman			0
' there are restrictions on numbers at the venue and we have to work within that			0
' @entity33 , who has won the @entity70 title three times , will lead the @entity104 team in the match that takes place from july 17 - 19			0
@entity10 have seven singles players in the world 's top 50 , with their best grass court player @entity111 having just recovered from injury			0
the former @entity3 champion – currently practising in @entity79 before beginning his @entity116 clay court campaign – is pleased with the venue , and may be called upon to play doubles as well as two singles matches .			0
