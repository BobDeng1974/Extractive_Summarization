by @entity0 published : 06:06 est , 19 july 2013 updated : 11:40 est , 19 july 2013 this is the dramatic moment a frustrated gambler returned to an @entity4 bar and smashed up seven fruit machines with an axe after losing more than £ 4,000			1
terrified drinkers dived for cover as @entity9 , 47 , walked into the bar in the @entity4 village of @entity12 , near @entity13 , and smashed up the machines in a fit of rage that is said to have lasted around 30 seconds			1
once he had destroyed the machines , @entity9 calmly walked out of the @entity18 and gave a thumbs up to two onlookers before waiting for the police to arrive and arrest him			1
@entity9 was sentenced to six years in jail for criminal damage , but walked free from court as prison sentences under two years are not enforced due to overcrowding			1
the @entity55 owner of the bar , who declined to be named , said : ' he comes in here all the time to play the machines			2
he 's had some wins but he spends a lot of money			0
' he is a labourer and only works every now and then			0
' he 's normally a very quiet man			0
there has never been any problems with him in the past			0
' he just walked in very calmly with an axe and smashed all the machines			1
there were several customers by them at the time and they were terrified			0
' luckily no - one was hurt but the machines are all broken			2
it 's going to cost me to replace them and i will be losing customers as when people came in they would always order something from the bar			0
' shock : startled onlookers begin to move out of @entity9 's way as he smashes each machine with a single blow run : those in the pub jump up from their seats about to run away from @entity88 who is wielding the axe captain @entity91 , of the local carabinieri police , said : ' it must have been a very frightening episode for those in the bar but he was very calm afterwards and arrested immediately by my officers			1
' he said that he had lost 5,000 euros on the machines and was so angry he just went home got the axe and decided to vent his frustration on them			0
' thanks to the cctv and the fact he was arrested immediately red handed he was sent for immediate trial at the local court			2
rage : @entity9 takes aim at his final machine before he leaves the bar calm again : @entity9 walked out of the bar and gave a thumbs up to two regulars before waiting for the police to arrive ' he had been in the bar every day for the past fortnight the owner said and had spent several hours at the machines			1
he did n't threaten any of the customers or the owner but just decided to attack the slot machine			0
' the incident came just days after a local mayor had asked bar owners to switch off machines for 24 hours to combat the country 's growing gambling addiction			2
slot machine addiction is a growing social phenomenon in @entity4 with arcades springing up all across the country as hard up @entity4 try and stretch their wages through gambling and several regional medical authorities have reported a rise in treating those hooked			0
earlier this year an @entity4 businessman was taken to hospital after worried bar owners in @entity139 called paramedics after he spent more than 12 hours on a machine pumping in more than £ 19,000 .			1

@entity9 smashed up the machines at a bar near @entity13 in *northern* @entity4
he walked into the bar and smashed up the machines in a 30 second rage
when he had finished , the father - of - two calmly walked back outside
he was arrested and sentenced to six months in jail in an immediate trial
@entity9 , a labourer , will not serve the sentence due to prison overcrowding
