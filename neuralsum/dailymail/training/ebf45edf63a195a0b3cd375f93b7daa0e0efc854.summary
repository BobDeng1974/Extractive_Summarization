@entity0 are much improved under the stewardship of @entity2 , but i ca n’t help feeling wednesday ’s announcement can only damage our chances for next year ’s @entity7			1
@entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 have developed into a settled and effective coaching team and have established a working environment that has produced results and shown great promise			2
starting with four great test matches next month , we are in for a hugely exciting year , culminating in a home @entity7 with these men rightfully at the helm			1
i believe they will all remain within the @entity0 set - up for some time			2
indeed , i have always felt @entity8 would eventually move up to a director of rugby position , with @entity9 taking the helm as head coach			0
i can also see the business sense from the @entity28 ’s perspective - the announcement implies belief , stability and consistency in the set - up			0
@entity2 will coach @entity0 beyond the @entity7 in 2019 after being handed a contract extension the @entity28 also handed contract extensions to @entity0 coaches @entity10 , @entity9 and @entity11 @entity37 @entity0 coaches extend contracts to 2020 but nobody was crying out for the coaching team to change , no - one was concerned they would be snapped up by other nations			1
so why make such a public announcement ? is the @entity28 going public good for @entity0 ’s @entity7 hopes ? no. it is a distraction that could diminish the team ’s hunger and fear factor			1
all of @entity0 ’s coaches are thoroughly professional and those who know them best will testify that their determination and drive will be a safeguard against complacency			1
but i am talking about the potential for the smallest of subconscious slips - and equally importantly , the smallest of fillips for the opposition			1
coaching in elite sport is not about job security , it is about knowing that if you lose the next few games , you ’re history			0
i would n’t want my players thinking about the coach being around for years to come while their position is forever on the line			2
i ’d rather they thought : ‘ this guy ’s job is on the line , so i ’ll put my body on the line for him			0
’ @entity0 coaches ( from left to right ) @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity8 and @entity9 extend their deals until 2019 the extensions are deserved but can only do harm rather than good to @entity0 's @entity80 challenge on the opposite side of the coin , if i was in the @entity81 or @entity83 camps i ’d be thinking : ‘ so they think they ’ve cracked it ? i ’m hungrier than the bloke in the tracksuit up in the stand			1
i ’ve got more to play for			0
’ it is a problem of perception that could have been avoided			0
throughout my time as @entity0 coach , one of my mantras was that everyone ’s noses must be pointed in the same direction			2
right now , every nose in the @entity0 set - up should be pointed at a home @entity7			1
every sinew and brain cell should be focused on next year : the @entity80 will set the tone for the development of rugby in this country for a long time			0
we must get every detail right			0
my 2003 @entity0 team agreed that there would be no distracting announcements as we went into the @entity7			1
it was clear that some of the senior players would be retiring , but nothing was said as it would have created a sideshow			0
similarly , i signed a contract extension as we were getting ready to fly to @entity119			2
again , nothing was announced			0
that time had to be about @entity0 , not about individuals			2
@entity0 won the @entity7 in 2003 and the player did not announce their expected retirements before it sir @entity125 signed an extension before the 2003 @entity7 but did not announce it to the public @entity2 has done a terrific job , picking up @entity0 from a low point after the last @entity7			1
i do n’t want anything to damage that progress at such a crucial point in the international cycle			0
the closer you get to a @entity7 , the tougher it gets for an international coach			2
all the big national sides renew their focus , they turn the intensity of their game up a notch or two			0
on wednesday we learned that the @entity0 coaching team will also prepare the team for the @entity146			1
we did n’t need to know that			0
no - one should be thinking that far ahead			0
let ’s deal with 2015 first ! the real test of how far @entity0 have progressed comes next year , in brutal @entity7 pool clashes against @entity119 and @entity151			1
@entity152 ( left ) and @entity153 ( right ) could lose motivation over their @entity0 chances @entity151 ( left ) and @entity119 ( right ) are in @entity0 's @entity7 pool and could be motivated by the annoucement awarding these contracts could also undermine ambition			1
it could erode the ambition of other @entity163 coaches who think they should have a crack at coaching @entity0			1
it could also kill the ambition of players who are outside the @entity0 set - up			1
@entity2 ’s team will think the news is great , that their man is now secure in the job for years to come			2
but what about the @entity174 and the @entity175 ? no matter how much @entity2 says he is keeping the door open , they will fear international rugby has passed them by			2
there ’s an interesting debate to be had as to whether an international coach has a natural shelf - life , a time after which new ideas are needed			0
we certainly have n’t reached that stage			0
@entity2 and his fellow coaches have already proved enough to deserve an extended run in the job			1
but i fear their new deals could hang over them like a dark and menacing cloud , that their contracts will become the story			0
world champions @entity81 could take extra motivation , believing @entity0 have become complacent @entity201 manager @entity200 suffered after being awarded an eight - year contract by @entity203 @entity201 ’s @entity200 , who was awarded an eight - year contract by @entity203 , is feeling the weight of this decision now			1
if @entity0 lose two of the autumn internationals , if they fail to win the 2015 @entity211 , will the length of @entity8 ’s contract become a similar weight ? what if @entity0 do n’t get out of what is a really tough @entity7 group ? i hope i am wrong about the @entity28 ’s hasty announcement			1
i want nothing more than for @entity8 ’s @entity0 to win the @entity7 next year			1
then we can debate whether he should keep going until 2019 or to move upstairs and let @entity9 take over			0
but i fear wednesday may have weakened @entity0 , even by the tiniest amount			2
international rugby is not a cosy environment			0
to get to the very top , a team needs to have an edge about them			0
@entity0 need an amazing intensity and a real fear factor for the next 12 months			1
they do n’t need to be thinking about @entity230 in 2019			0
@entity9 ( second right ) could be the next @entity0 head coach in waiting after impressing so far			2

@entity0 have improved *massively* under @entity2 's stewardship
@entity2 and his staff deserve extensions but not in the public domain
extensions can only damage @entity0 's @entity7 2015 chances
it is a distraction that is not needed and could diminish team 's fear factor
@entity81 , @entity119 and other sides will gain motivation from this
ambition for players and management could be eroded as a result
even a *marginal* subconscious slips could cost @entity0 next year
coaches and players with @entity0 aspirations could also be affected by it
