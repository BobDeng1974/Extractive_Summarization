@entity0 led the way in both practice sessions for sunday 's @entity3			1
@entity0 suggested @entity4 will be back in control for this race after @entity7 and @entity8 conjured one of the surprises for many a season with the team 's first victory for almost two years at the last race in @entity15			1
many people expected another dominant @entity4 campaign in the wake of last season 's crushing success and thoroughly convincing win in the opening race in @entity23			1
@entity0 was fastest in both practice sessions for this weekend 's @entity3 the @entity25 , mobbed by fans in the paddock , is bidding to win his fourth @entity28 @entity3 1			1

will @entity51 - @entity7 1:44.564 even @entity4 motorsport boss @entity52 suggested @entity7 's success was ' a wake - up call ' to his organisation			2
without doubt @entity4 , and @entity0 in particular , responded as he initially finished 0.541 seconds quicker than team - mate @entity57 at the end of @entity59 when @entity61 's medium - compound tyre was used			1
switching to the faster soft tyre for runs in @entity64 , @entity0 again comfortably had the edge by 0.443secs over @entity7 's @entity29			1
@entity32 's @entity30 was third quickest , 1.093secs adrift , but only after taking to the track 40 minutes late due to issues			2
it is yet to be determined whether they were the same problems that ultimately brought an end to team - mate @entity34 's day			2
as the young @entity74 exited the pits with 20 minutes remaining his brakes caught fire , and although @entity34 attempted to return , he was eventually forced to pull off track			0
@entity48 trudges off the track after his spin brought out the red flags during the second practice session the @entity84 inspects his @entity85 after he locked up on the approach to turn 14 before losing the back end @entity8 was fourth on the timesheet , 1.120secs down , with @entity57 fifth after making a mistake on his fast lap on the soft tyres			1
@entity92 still ended up sixth , followed by the @entity85 of @entity93 , @entity43 's @entity36 and @entity94 in his @entity95			2
@entity38 's @entity39 completed the top 10 , two seconds down as he and the team continue to show signs of improvement , with team - mate @entity42 12th and a further half a second off the pace			1
@entity48 's session , meanwhile , lasted 38 minutes as the @entity85 driver skidded off the track at the end of the longest straight in @entity107			2
@entity34 's brakes caught fire when he left the pits and the @entity32 driver ended up in the gravel @entity42 looks on from the back of the @entity38 garage ... he ended the second session in 12th the @entity84 locked up on the approach to turn 14 , losing the back end of the car and resulting in a slide on to the run - off area where he lost the left front - wing endplate after clipping a barrier			1
although @entity48 managed to keep the engine running and reversed his car , the endplate lodged under the left - front tyre , forcing him to abandon			0
it resulted in the session being red - flagged for the car 's retrieval , with @entity48 ultimately finishing down in 17th			2
manor duo @entity50 and @entity132 brought up the rear , the latter encountering issues with his power unit in @entity64 which restricted him to just six laps			0
@entity132 will be hoping the problem can be resolved as he has already missed qualifying and the race in both @entity23 and @entity15 due to other difficulties			1
@entity8 , winner at the @entity15 @entity3 last time out , was fourth quickest in the second session			1

@entity0 was fastest in both practice sessions for sunday 's race
@entity0 , the world champion , is bidding to win his fourth race in @entity28
he leads title race from @entity8 who won last time out in @entity15
@entity29 was second fastest in the second session in @entity151
@entity39 was 10th in his @entity38 with @entity42 12th
