by @entity0 @entity1 has led a gilded life			1
at 16 , he was already performing as a drummer and he went on to play in three of @entity5 's iconic bands : the @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8			0
the father - of - six lives with his second wife , @entity12 , a former model , in a @entity15 manor house and presides over his own polo club , where prince @entity17 is a visitor			1
then , last september , he was dealt two huge blows			2
as he puts it : ' my lovely mum , who was 89 , was dying in hospital , and i was diagnosed with prostate cancer			1
' thankfully , his cancer was caught early			2
' even so , it 's been a huge shock , ' says 65 - year - old @entity1 , ' and i had some dark moments			1
' last september @entity1 , pictured with wife @entity12 , was diagnosed with prostate cancer he also had some medical luck			1
for in his anxiety about his mother , he 'd forgotten to renew his private health insurance and ended up being treated at his local @entity38 hospital , the @entity30 in @entity31 - which is the only centre in the country offering a cutting edge treatment for prostate cancer			1
' someone was looking after me , ' he says , with an upward gaze			0
as the cancer had not spread beyond the prostate , @entity1 was suitable for brachytherapy , a form of internal radiotherapy			1
unlike standard radiotherapy , which is fired from outside the body and carries a risk of causing damage to the nerves and / or surrounding tissue - potentially leading to incontinence and impotence - brachytherapy involves implanting tiny radioactive seeds inside the prostate , where they target the rapidly dividing cancer cells close up			1
but @entity1 had a newer form , known as @entity60 , which has been developed by a team at the @entity30 led by professor @entity62 , a consultant urological surgeon			1
this relies on two types of radioactive seeds , loose and ' stranded ' , which are like beads on a thread			0
( @entity68 brachytherapy uses one or the other type			2
) was treated at @entity15 - the only centre in the country offering a cutting edge treatment ultrasound scans taken beforehand are used to precisely map the size and shape of the prostate , so the surgeon knows how long the strands of seeds should be ; these are then pre-loaded on needles			1
while the loose seeds are precisely placed inside the prostate , the stranded seeds are placed around the inside edge , emitting radiation just outside the gland to tackle any microscopic cancer cells that might have escaped			1
the idea is to treat the whole prostate , not just the areas of malignancy flagged up by a biopsy			2
the number of loose seeds is decided during the procedure itself			0
the @entity97 element of the treatment is the use of a special computer during surgery			1
in real time , this adds up the radiotherapy dose as each loose seed is implanted , so each patient gets the precise amount they need			2
the difference in terms of side - effects is significant , says professor @entity62			2
he also performs robotic removal of the prostate - said to be a more accurate form of prostate surgery - and says that one in 20 of these patients suffers incontinence afterwards			1
and more than half have difficulty getting an erection again , because the very small nerves connecting with the penis may be severed during surgery			0
standard brachytherapy , available in most @entity5 cancer centres , reduces the chance of incontinence and impotence compared with both prostate removal and traditional radiotherapy			1
professor @entity62 says that with the @entity97 version , there is ' less than a 1 per cent chance of incontinence , and more than 83 per cent of our brachytherapy patients retain an erection '			1
' also , we can find no evidence of cancer in more than 90 per cent of the 700 patients we have treated with 4d brachytherapy over eight years , ' says professor @entity62			1
' we are world leaders in this			0
' dr @entity144 , a co-founder of brachytherapy in @entity146 in 1985 , has been over and wants to take it back to the @entity148 ' we are training clinicians , and three @entity5 centres should be offering it over the next three years			1
' @entity1 thinks that if men knew having their prostate checked need n't be the end of their sex life , or harm bladder control , more would be tested			1
he says that he 'd had annoying bladder problems for more than 15 years			0
' i 'd get up three or four times in the night			0
i 'd feel an urgency but then could n't pass much water			0
but i was in denial and never saw a doctor because i feared it might be cancer			2
' professor @entity62 says the common perception that urinary symptoms are the key sign is erroneous , and less than 1 per cent of the prostate cancer patients he sees have urinary symptoms			1
in fact , such symptoms are more common in advanced cases where cancer has spread outside the prostate			1
the drop in the number of men dying as a result of prostate cancer in the past decade instead of waiting for symptoms , he believes men over 50 should have regular tests of their levels of prostate specific antigen ( @entity184 ) , a protein produced by the prostate			1
it was a @entity184 test that first alerted @entity1 's gp to his problems			1
he was offered the test in a routine check - up last september			1
' i was scared and wanted to say no , but i agreed to it			0
what a fool i was for not being more informed			0
' a week later , it came back as 6.7 and a second test a week on showed it had risen to 6.8			0
in a man of @entity1 's age , the @entity184 level is usually no higher than 4			1
@entity1 underwent a biopsy and mri scan			1
as he was being tested , he admits he became upset			0
' i thought i might never get an erection again , ' he says			0
' these were worries i could n't share , not even with my wife			0
what if sex was never the same again ? we love each other , but enjoying a healthy sex life is important			0
' a couple of weeks after the biopsy , @entity1 was told that he had cancer but that it had n't spread outside the prostate			1
' of course i was still concerned , but it was very different to when i was told my enlarged thyroid gland might be cancerous 30 years ago			0
back then , i could n't hear a word until the shock subsided			0
' it turned out to be benign			0
now that i 'm older , thoughts like , " i 've had a pretty good life " went through my head			0
' @entity1 had a newer form of radiotherapy , known as @entity97 brachytherapy when @entity1 told his children , aged from 16 to 42 , ' they were a bit shell - shocked			1
because i 'm dyslexic , i 'd had to read the hospital information pack three or four times so i could explain the treatment to them			2
' he underwent the brachytherapy in january under general anaesthetic , and was discharged the next day with tamsulosin			2
this drug relaxes the muscles around the bladder and prostate to assist urination			2
( night - time problems with urination can surface four to six weeks after surgery once the radiation begins working			2
) during his recovery , @entity1 suffered insomnia			1
' the nights were long and my bladder was very full			0
it was uncomfortable - as if i had a cork stuffed up it			2
it 's not very rock ' n ' roll , but camomile tea helped			0
i got about two hours ' sleep and people said i looked ill. ' professor @entity62 advised avoiding sex until two to four weeks after the surgery as it can be uncomfortable			0
but then he 's probably never treated a rock star before			2
the minute i got an erection , i was delighted			0
my wife has no complaints			0
' in april , he was thrilled when his @entity184 test came back at 2.5			0
professor @entity62 says that after three months the radiation has all but fizzled out , but the cancerous cells take longer to die off			0
' @entity184 levels fall over two to three years , and by five years our average @entity184 is 0.1 , ' he says			0
he acknowledges this treatment is no better at curing patients than prostate removal , but argues that it leaves patients with a better quality of life			1
professor @entity277 , a trustee of @entity278 @entity5 , offers a dissenting voice : ' the big advantage of getting rid of the prostate is that the cancer can not return			2
' meanwhile , @entity1 has been working to raise funds for @entity278 @entity5 with a benefit night at @entity285 , reuniting him with @entity286 and @entity287 for the first time since he left @entity8 in 1988			2
' i want to increase awareness - a man dies of prostate cancer every hour in the @entity5 , ' he says			1
' my wife and i have had everything - and we do n't need that any more			0
now is the time for me to enjoy my wife and family in a more relaxed way			0
i intend to live to a ripe old age			0

last september @entity1 , 65 , was diagnosed with prostate cancer
treated at @entity15 - the only centre offering cutting edge treatment
@entity1 had a newer form of radiotherapy , known as @entity97 brachytherapy
