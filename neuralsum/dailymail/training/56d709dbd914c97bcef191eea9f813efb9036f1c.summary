legendary commentator @entity0 , 57 , has seen it all from what he calls his ' view in the clouds ' and on thursday he set his sights on the critics of horse - racing , labelling them ' unrealistic and completely uneducated ' , after the tragic events of @entity9			1
' these are just things that happen , that 's just life , i mean people have heart attacks and so do horses , ' he said in reference to the sad demise of @entity19 and @entity20 after the big race			2
' you can always shut the gate after the horse has bolted but it 's pretty hard to predict every single thing that could happen in the world but to compare waving a flag in the crowd and a horse having a heart attack with being cruel to horses is unreasonable , unrealistic and completely uneducated			1
@entity0 calls time on a 30 year race - calling career the sad demise of @entity9 runners @entity20 ( left ) and @entity19 ( right ) post the race that stops a nation has nothing to do with issues of animal cruelty according to retired race - caller and author @entity0 the early days			1
@entity0 takes to the microphone at a country race meeting ' i travelled all over the place but loved every minute ' december 12 , 2008 and good mate and legendary driver @entity52 waves goodbye to @entity0 ( high up in the commentary box ) as he calls his final race as he takes his horse to the line at @entity58 in a fitting finale his tales from the track are as many as they are varied			1
he remembers watching on from his vantage point high up in the stands as ' a scallywag bookmaker ' ran for his life from a phalanx of irate punters demanding their cash , to a trainer who conspired to fix a race with his two horses , only for the wrong one to win costing him thousands of dollars			1
' i 've also seen a bloke jump off a horse to make sure it gets beaten but then racing is no different to other forms , ' he said			1
' there is that side to the industry but there is that ( seedy ) side to many industries , i always say to people that racing is no different to real estate or the law profession or anything else for that matter			2
' it has some good people in it and it has some scallywags in it , that 's just life			0
' i do n't think racing necessarily has more than plenty of other industries but , yes , it does have some notable ones because where money is involved and there 's gambling , you are sure to attract that kind of element			2
' rather than dwell on the negative side of the sport , most of what i have seen is just simply uplifting , i have seen things that would make grown men cry			0
that 's the beauty and the romance of racing			0
' a champion junior tennis player , @entity0 celebrates with @entity113 legend @entity112 ( @entity114 )			1
his career in the spot and hopes of winning at @entity118 one day was cut short by a serious back injury however , he might have been the watched rather than the watcher , if fate had n't intervened and cut short a promising tennis career			0
he 'd been the top junior in @entity123 and even had the privilege of sharing a celebratory drink with @entity118 champion and @entity113 legend @entity112 ( @entity114 ) but at age 19 he was carried off the tennis court in agony as his back gave out			1
so the avid fan of racing and race commentators , decided that he would train himself as a caller			0
armed with tape recorder he practised and then went out and cut his teeth in the bush , including places like @entity140 and @entity141 and he said that ' some of the places i started at are ghost towns now but when you 're 19 just starting out , you 'll go anywhere to get experience '			0
employed within six months , he went on to become a leading broadcaster of thoroughbred racing , harness racing and greyhounds			0
a stellar career which would stretch some three decades , all because of his love of the animals			0
@entity155 's favourite pacer , @entity156 , with @entity52 in the sulky ' it can make you cry because horses strive to be a winner and they do with no ulterior motive because they choose to , ' he said			1
' it 's a wonderful thing , it 's an innocence - there 's no guile attached to what they want to do , if they want to try to win from an unlikely position , if they look beaten and somehow find a way to win then it 's because they want to			0
' that 's what brings a tear to the corner of you eye , the bravery like that born of innocence , it 's an amazing thing and that 's the type of thing that crosses demographics			0
' the @entity58 faithful make their feelings known as @entity0 calls it quits on his broadcasting career they say never work with children and animals			2
@entity0 breaks at least one of those rules as he undertakes a television interview with a furry friend as company one of his favourite of all time was champion pacer @entity156 ' he came out at the age of 13 to do a time trial in aid of the @entity204 , to make money for the kids and ran the fastest time of his entire career after almost 200 race starts on the final night he set foot on a racetrack , breaking all sorts of world records , the tears were just flowing '			1
on december 12 , 2008 , his last night in the broadcast box , there was n't a dry eye in the house either , as his good mate and superstar driver @entity52 took his horse to the line first , saluting his mate high up in the @entity58 stands as he won			0
the view from @entity223 is @entity0 's second book , following princess : the @entity226			2
the view from @entity223 is @entity0 's second book since retiring from the broadcast box			2

@entity0 called racing in @entity123 for more than 30 years
labels critics of horse - racing as ' unrealistic and completely uneducated '
recalled how a trainer ' no names , no pack - drills ' organised a fix by backing one of his horses and organising to stop his other , the favourite
the sting failed when the better horse could not be *slowed* down , costing the trainer ' tens of thousands '
another *incident* saw a bookmaker bolt through a car - park pursued by a group of angry punters whom he *refused* to *pay*
