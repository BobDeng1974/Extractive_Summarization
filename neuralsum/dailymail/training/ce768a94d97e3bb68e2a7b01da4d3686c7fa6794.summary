by @entity0 a young couple who receive more than £ 17,000 a year in benefits appeared on @entity4 's @entity3 to defend their taxpayer - funded lifestyle			1
@entity6 , 21 , and @entity7 , 18 , who live in a comfortable two - bedroom flat in @entity9 with their four month old daughter , @entity10 , say they are better off on £ 17k benefits and argue that unless they are able to find jobs that pay £ 18,000 a year or more , there 's no point in working			1
the couple also hit back at those who describe them as scroungers , arguing that because their hard - working parents have paid tax all their lives , they are entitled to claim some of the money back			2
' she also claimed that because the pair have paid tax in the past , their daughter should also be entitled to claim benefits in future			0
' we have paid into the system as well and you know , if our daughter wants to claim when she 's older , she can			0
we 're not going to claim benefits forever so we are going to pay into the system at some point			0
' the pair receive £ 1,473 per month in benefits or £ 17,680 per year			1
this works out at £ 340 per week , which includes £ 140 housing benefit , £ 60 child tax credit , £ 20 child benefit and £ 110 @entity58			1
weekly outgoings include £ 60 on food , £ 22.50 on tv , £ 3.50 on their tv licence plus utility bills , which the pair say they receive no help with			1
according to @entity7 , their 47 " flat screen tv is their only luxury , although @entity6 also admits to smoking roll - up cigarettes which are also paid for by tax payers			1
shocked : hosts @entity71 and @entity73 appeared shocked by the couples ' comments angry : radio presenter @entity76 said he was angry with the system but felt some sympathy for the pair although neither have any qualifications , @entity6 , who has also worked as a shelf stacker in the past , says he is now looking for a job - although says he wo n't accept any old role			2
' what is the point [ of a minimum wage job ] ? you know , i 'm not going to go to work to be worse off			0
@entity7 added : ' the main problem is is that the cost of living is going up so much but the wages are just the same			2
but people still expect you to live on the minimum wage - i do n't think that 's right			0
' although @entity6 says he does intend to get a job , the pair say they will carry on living on benefits until @entity6 gets a job that pays enough or ' the system changes '			2
' we 'll carry on until the system changes if @entity6 does n't get a job , ' says @entity7			1
@entity6 added : ' we ca n't be scroungers because the government would n't give us the money or pay towards our living expenses if we did n't need it			1
' taxes : the duo say they are right to claim benefits because their parents have paid taxes all their lives unfortunately for @entity6 and @entity7 , the change in the system they so dread is n't far away			1
in a statement read out on this morning , the @entity122 said : ' we have to end the absurdity in the welfare system where people are better off claiming benefits than they are in work			0
' @entity130 will ensure that work will always pay and people who can work will no longer be able to count on the state to fund a life on benefits			0
' asked what they intend to do when the new system is introduced , @entity7 quickly replied : ' he 'd have to get a job i suppose			0
