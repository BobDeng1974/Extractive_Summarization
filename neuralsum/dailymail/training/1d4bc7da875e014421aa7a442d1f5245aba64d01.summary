@entity1 coach @entity0 said his side 's football was ' pointless ' after they fell to their fifth defeat of the season on saturday			1
a 2 - 1 loss at @entity7 plummeted the club into their ' worst situation in years ' , in the words of director of sport @entity11 , and @entity0 did not beat about the bush either			1
' we played a kind of football which is absolutely pointless , ' he said at the post-match press conference			2
' we 've just got to face the music once again			0
' the afternoon had started out so well for @entity1 fans , who saw @entity37 lining up for the first time in 14 months and both @entity39 and @entity40 back from injuries			1
the return of that trio appeared more to unsettle the side than to help them out of their current crisis , which has instead thickened			0
despite the return of stars such as @entity49 conceded twice in @entity7 @entity51 's 74th minute goal condemned @entity0 's side to another defeat , their third league loss in a row ' we just made it too easy for our opponents , ' @entity0 moaned			1
' we 've got to eradicate these mistakes			0
not tomorrow , not the day after but straight away			0
' we are almost always scoring goals and if we did n't concede any , then the situation would look completely different			0
' we 've got to resolve this and nobody 's going to help us			2
' @entity0 complained that his team , who fell behind to this @entity68 strike , made things too easy for @entity7			2

@entity1 's 2 - 1 defeat is their fifth loss in eight games
@entity0 says ' we made it too easy for our opponents '
@entity39 , @entity40 and @entity37 all returned
but @entity1 still failed to rectify their poor form with star players
