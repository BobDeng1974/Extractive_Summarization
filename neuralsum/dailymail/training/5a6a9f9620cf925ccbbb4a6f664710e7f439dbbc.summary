by @entity0 published : 06:52 est , 8 november 2013 updated : 07:59 est , 8 november 2013 refugees fleeing war - torn @entity3 could resurrect the spectre of polio in @entity7 , experts have warned			1
@entity7 was declared polio - free by the @entity9 in 2002 , but is now threatened by a new outbreak of the disease reported in @entity3 , it is claimed			1
the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) said the virus probably spread from @entity13 - one of three countries where polio is still endemic - and warned that @entity3 's outbreak posed a threat to millions of children across the @entity18			1
immunisation : displace @entity3 children line up to receive vaccination against polio at one of the @entity3 refugee camps in the southern port city of @entity25 this week mapping the cases : the number of polio cases in 2013			1
blue : at risk and subject to @entity9 vaccination programme			1
grey : at risk due to low vaccination coverage			1
two @entity37 infection experts writing in @entity39 medical journal highlight the fact that the polio vaccine currently used throughout @entity7 is not 100 percent effective			2
in parts of @entity7 where vaccine coverage is low , including @entity46 , @entity47 , and @entity48 , immunisation levels may not be high enough to prevent sustained transmission of the polio virus , they stress			1
with large numbers of people now fleeing @entity3 and seeking refuge in neighbouring countries and @entity7 , polio could reappear in areas that have been free of the disease for decades			1
warning : the ( @entity9 ) said the virus probably spread from @entity13 and warned that @entity3 's outbreak posed a threat to millions of children across the @entity18 ' vaccinating only @entity3 refugees - as has been recommended by the @entity63 - must be judged as insufficient ; more comprehensive measures should be taken into consideration , ' said professor @entity66 , from the @entity67 , and dr @entity68 , from the @entity69 in @entity70			1
the polio vaccine used in most @entity7 countries today is the inactivated polio vaccine ( @entity73 ) , which is injected			2
it usually forms part of a combined diphtheria , tetanus , whooping cough and polio jab			0
while good at preventing paralysis , @entity73 provides only partial protection from infection , @entity80 and dr @entity68 point out			0
once children were routinely vaccinated with an oral polio vaccine ( @entity87 ) , taken in the form of mouth drops , which uses a live virus and is more effective			0
but this was discontinued in the @entity92 and many other countries because in rare cases it can trigger paralysis			0
@entity98 executive director @entity97 , right , discusses polio vaccines with a health worker during a @entity98 - supported vaccination campaign at the @entity102 in @entity103 since only one in 200 polio infections cause symptoms , the virus could be circulating for nearly a year before a single case of paralysis occurs , according to the experts			2
by this time , hundreds of individuals may be carrying the virus			0
prof @entity66 and dr @entity68 wrote : ' hundreds of thousands of people are fleeing @entity3 and seek refuge in neighbouring countries and @entity7			2
because only one in 200 unvaccinated individuals infection with @entity116 ( wild - type polio virus 1 ) will develop acute flaccid paralysis , infected individuals can spread the virus unrecognised			0
' oral polio vaccination provides high protection against acquisition and spreading of the infection , but this vaccine was discontinued in @entity7 because of rare cases of vaccination - related acute flaccid paralysis			1
' only some of the @entity129 member states still allow its use and none has a stockpile of oral polio vaccines			0
routine screening of sewage for polio virus has not been done in most @entity7 countries , but this intensified surveillance measure should be considered for settlements with large numbers of @entity3 refugees			1
' @entity143 , a virologist at @entity92 's @entity144 , said : ' where war goes , pestilence , famine and death often follow			0
each new baby who is born is at risk of polio until vaccinated , and conflict inevitably disrupts local vaccination efforts			2
' poliovirus has been nearly eradicated for almost a decade now			0
most of the last pockets of poliovirus in @entity157 , @entity13 , @entity158 and now @entity3 have been centres of conflict			2
it is likely that poliovirus will continue to linger , following conflict around the globe until it is eradicated once and for all			0
' the @entity3 outbreak puts @entity7 at risk because of the way we give vaccines			1
in parts of the world where it is still possible to catch a wild strain of poliovirus , children are usually vaccinated with a live but genetically weakened poliovirus which gives excellent protection but has a tiny risk of changing back to the more dangerous form			0
' however , in parts of the world where polio has been eradicated , like the @entity92 , children are usually given a killed vaccine			0
it does n't protect quite as well but it can not mutate , so it protects reasonably well while preventing polio from being accidentally reintroduced to a country			0
' vaccination is never perfect , so despite being vaccinated , a small percentage of children in the @entity92 would be at risk of contracting polio if they were exposed to the virus			2
until the virus is completely extinct , it is essential that we continue to vaccinate our children			0
' the @entity9 has confirmed an outbreak of at least 10 cases of polio in @entity3 , where vaccination coverage has dramatically decreased because of the civil war .			1
