by @entity0 @entity1 , 41 , prepared for @entity3 's opening @entity5 match with yoga and a blow dry as the hapless men around her face a torrent of abuse , @entity1 has emerged as the @entity13 ’s star @entity5 performer			1
and yesterday the sports presenter revealed the key to her cool head – two hours of yoga and a match day wash and blow dry			1
while juggling punditry , pitch - side interviews and epic journeys across @entity21 to follow the games , married mother of two mrs @entity1 has been updating her fans on her personal website			1
yesterday , the 41 - year - old described how she prepared for @entity3 ’s opening game against @entity28 on saturday night with yoga and some time to herself			1
‘ i ’ll come clean , you should know that as well as coffee i am a little addicted to yoga , ’ she wrote			2
‘ i think it ’s changed me in the last seven months			0
‘ on match day i was aiming to sleep as late as possible knowing we ’d have a late night and i made it to 8.15am			2
‘ so i indulged myself in around two hours of yoga			2
at home , it ’s not easy doing it with kids around so i tend to do it before they get up , which is a beautiful hour of the day			0
’ mrs @entity1 , who is married with twins , said yoga had transformed her life and her relationships with her family			1
she described how her son will try to distract her as she does headstands but has now learned to leave her in peace			0
‘ i do n’t feel like snapping at my lovely husband as much , which has got to be a good thing , ’ she wrote			0
‘ a few weeks ago i was practising yoga when my eight - year - old son came in to the room to ask me something			1
at this point i was holding a head - stand for 30 breaths			2
he was lying on the floor with his nose almost touching mine , trying to distract me , asking if he could go for a play date , but the yoga was more powerful			2
‘ so i ignored him and as i was in a head stand he seemed to accept that			0
if anyone has been nagged by an eight - year - old boy you will understand it ’s almost worth learning to do a head stand if they give up on their demands that easily			2
’ the presenter and former gymnast explained how she also treated herself to some proper grooming time before the game on saturday – although the oppressive conditions in @entity21 somewhat ruined the effect			1
‘ after the match day yoga on saturday i washed and blow dried my hair all the while knowing that the second i stepped out of my hotel room in @entity86 it would take on a new life of its own in the heat ( think @entity90 circa 1975 ) , ’ she wrote			1
‘ then i applied my make - up which would n’t actually be seen on screen until seven hours later by which point it would probably have slid off into the ether			2
or wherever it is make - up which disappears off your face actually goes			0
the whole grooming process felt a bit futile in @entity86			0
’ @entity1 said she felt ' bedraggled ' and ' grotty ' after @entity3 's defeat to @entity28 on saturday night			1
pictured : interviewing former @entity3 player @entity102 pitchside before the match mrs @entity1 described how she felt ‘ bedraggled ’ and ‘ grotty ’ after @entity3 ’s defeat to @entity28 on saturday night			1
the following morning , she had to be up at 4am for a flight to @entity105 , but said having children was good training for working when exhausted			0
‘ i can survive a night without sleep ( i have twins ) , ’ she added			0
mrs @entity1 has been widely praised for her coverage in @entity21			1
she has previously accused rival broadcaster sky of using female sports presenters in figure - hugging outfits as ‘ window dressing ’			1
' after the match day yoga on saturday i washed and blow dried my hair all the while knowing that the second i stepped out of my hotel room in @entity86 it would take on a new life of its own ' - @entity1 as @entity123 and foreign pundits have faced criticism for being boring and incomprehensible , she has been lauded for her intelligent and considered observations and insights			1
mrs @entity1 , who lives in @entity128 with husband @entity129 and their twin children , said she kept down to earth by remembering what a ‘ privileged ’ position she is in			1
‘ so there i was waiting in the tunnel for the @entity3 team bus to arrive , it was only 20 minutes later than we had been told but long enough for me to think what a crazy and privileged job i have , ’ she wrote			2
‘ i get to see really incredible people and the things they do from a different angle			0
none of us permanently show the world exactly who we are , there is a tendency to demand that all talented sports people should be ebullient , loquacious and full of wisdom			0
‘ some will be but others will just be very talented sports people , shy people , people who have no desire to be in the limelight except for the sporting success they achieve			0
‘ witnessing the moments when they are “ off ” is as fascinating as seeing them “ on ” , remembering that they are people , not @entity161 , and most of them realise that too			0
they are people not @entity161 and they too have feet of clay			0
uniquely this weekend we all seemed to agree that they tried their very best and that is all you can ask of anyone			0
