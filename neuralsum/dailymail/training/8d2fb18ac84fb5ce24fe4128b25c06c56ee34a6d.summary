have you ever watched the @entity1 , when some loser is exposed by a lie detector as a cheat			0
the details of how he slept with someone else behind his wife ’s back are made public , and the audience boo him			0
and then they jeer and laugh as he declares he still loves his wife and never stopped loving her			0
@entity14 is due an appearance on @entity17 ’s show soon because of what happened at the @entity19 at the weekend			0
' i cheated on @entity21 – but i still love that club ! ' a @entity17 audience would hound him off the stage : but football fans are so over-emotional they swallow this garbage			1
one of the great things about @entity14 ’s goal against @entity21 on sunday is that this myth that a professional footballer can love a club has been exploded and hopefully no fan will ever be so naïve they embarrass themselves by spouting such nonsense ever again			1
@entity36 midfielder @entity14 applauds the @entity21 supporters at the @entity19 on sunday @entity14 scores the equaliser past @entity39 in @entity36 's 1 - 1 draw with @entity21 @entity14 is due an appearance on the @entity1 after scoring against @entity21 at the weekend the general rule is that players play for whoever will pay them the most			1
' i love this club , i never wanted to leave , ' actually translates as : ' i was going to leave but they increased my money so i stayed			0
' it ’s not a problem , unless a player tries to convince us they love a club			2
in @entity14 ’s case he did n’t want to leave @entity21 , but he had no choice – the club did n’t want to keep him			1
but that does n’t mean he should agree to go to @entity36 on loan where he knows he is likely to play against @entity21			2
who knows how the season will pan out , but that goal @entity14 scored at the @entity19 might be crucial			1
if @entity36 pip @entity21 to the title by a point in may then it will be @entity14 ’s equaliser that will be remembered as a massive moment that helped deny @entity21 the title			1
so how can lampard claim to love a club when that club is denied two points by a goal he has scored ? that goal potentially , damages @entity21 ’s chances of winning the title for the first time since 2010			1
every fan of a football club knows exactly what i ’m talking about			0
if you love a club , you do n’t do anything to damage their chances of being successful			2
@entity14 is a legend with the @entity21 fans after his 13 - year spell at @entity88 @entity21 fans showed their appreciation with a banner honouring @entity14 at the @entity19 @entity14 said : ' i did n’t expect to come on and score			1
' really ? @entity21 ’s all - time top scorer , a man who ’s biggest strength throughout his career has been his ability to score goals , is brought on with @entity36 losing 1 - 0 , and he did n’t expect to score ? i appreciate it ’s sometimes difficult after a game for a player to find the right thing to say			1
and ultimately i ’m not criticising @entity14 for playing the game and scoring a goal – it ’s what he does best of course			2
but this should be a lesson to all professional footballers : only the most gullible fans will swallow your nonsense about your ' love ' for their club			1
you ca n’t love a club and then score against them – no amount of applauding those fans afterwards will take that goal away			2
@entity14 loved his time at @entity21 , he loved the support of the fans he had at @entity88			1
but he ca n’t love @entity21 and then score such a big goal against them			2
@entity14 ( right ) scores the equaliser for @entity36 as @entity21 captain @entity124 shows his dismay @entity14 acknowledges the crowd but tones down his celebration after scoring against his old club video i told @entity14 to score - @entity130 at the risk of returning to the @entity17 analogy again , it ’s in @entity14 ’s dna to score goals ; as he said after the game : ' i ’m just doing my job			1
' i respect @entity14 for that			0
but people who love a football club give up work to show that love and watch them			0
they do n’t ' just do their job ' , damage them , and then still profess love			0
@entity14 can do what he wants – play for who he wants , and score for who he wants			0
but he ’s mugged off @entity21 fans massively here			2
if it is true love he would n’t dream of playing against them , especially not a title rival			0
he did n’t have to join @entity36 but he did			0
and as soon as he did that , as @entity157 said , ' the love stories are over			0
' and the @entity21 fans with their @entity14 banners at the @entity19 looked like the man on the @entity17 show who walked in on his missus in bed with another bloke			1
' i can forgive everything ! ' he desperately cries , as the rest of the world cringes for him .			0

@entity14 scored the equaliser in @entity36 's 1 - 1 draw with @entity21 on sunday
the myth that a professional footballer can love a club has been exploded
@entity14 left @entity21 in the *summer* because the @entity88 club did not want to keep him
the goal @entity14 scored could prove crucial come the end of the @entity183 season
it potentially damages @entity21 's chances of winning the title for the first time since 2010
only the most gullible fans will swallow the nonsense about a player loving a club
