the contestant , whose name was @entity11 , had to solve a puzzle that was missing just one letter when his brain failed on him			1
and before he could figure out what happened , the guy next to him quickly stole his thunder			0
but his luck was about to change and its all because of the word ' @entity31			2
' things were looking good for @entity11 when he spun the famous wheel on the long - running game show ’s season premier ’s			1
it landed on the coveted @entity38 prize , in between treacherous @entity40 spots			0
@entity11 asked for a c , and there were three			1
he triumphantly held his million dollar panel , which would have turned into a real million dollars had he continued on his winning track			0
but his unfortunate misstep came when he solved the puzzle			0
still happy : @entity11 triumphantly held up his game piece			1
had he kept on that track , he could have eventually won the million bucks ' @entity50 ' : with only one missing letter , @entity11 's win seemed like a lock , but he mispronounced ' curio ' and lost big time the words ‘ corner @entity57 ’ tried to come out , but curio just did n’t sound quite right			1
after a long , hushed pause , the judges hit the wrong answer buzzer and @entity11 ’s neighbour went on to pronounce the words correctly			2
‘ it did n't come out the way you intended it to , we 'll take a look at it during the commercial to make sure we treated you fairly , ’ said host @entity63			0
after that , @entity11 just looked sad			2
