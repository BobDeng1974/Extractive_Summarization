by @entity0 apples are often said to be healthy snack and a good low - calorie food - but could they also be a promising aphrodisiac ? that ’s the case according to a study that says the fruit can boost sexual pleasure in women			1
the researchers found a link between enhanced sexual function in healthy women and regular daily apple use			2
researchers in @entity16 have found apples ( stock image shown ) can boost sexual pleasure			1
the findings were made as part of a study of 731 @entity16 women			1
each of the women was asked to say how often they consumed apples , with those who ate more reporting higher sexual pleasure an apple a day could stop you having a heart attack - and may even be as effective as taking a statin , claim @entity33 researchers			1
they say healthy over- 50s who add a daily apple to their diet can benefit as much as those who start taking a tablet			0
their study goes some way to proving the proverb coined by the @entity45 : ‘ an apple a day keeps the doctor away			0
’ the scientists ’ calculations suggest that prescribing an apple a day to everyone aged 50 and over would prevent or delay around 8,500 heart attacks and strokes a year in the @entity53			0
the health benefits are similar to giving statins to everyone over 50 who is not already taking cholesterol - lowering drugs			0
in the study published in @entity61 they analysed 731 healthy @entity16 women aged 18 to 43			1
all of the participants were asked to report on their daily apple consumption and their eating habits			0
they were then split into two groups , one that ate apples regularly - more than one a day - and another that ate less than one a day			2
the participants were then also asked to fill out the @entity73 ( @entity73 )			0
the @entity73 required them to answer 19 questions about their sexual activities including frequency and overall satisfaction , reports @entity79			0
it was found that eating an apple a day was linked with higher fsfi scores , suggesting it increased their sexual pleasure			1
eating more apples apparently increased their lubrication and sexual function , enhancing the experience according to the study			2
the researchers think the reason for this may be because apples contain phloridzin			2
this is a compound that is quite similar to the female sex hormone called estradiol , which plays a large role in sexual arousal			1
‘ this study suggests a potential relationship between regular daily apple consumption and better sexuality in our young women population , ’ the researchers conclude			0
the reason for this according to the researchers may be that , like red wine and chocolate ( stock image shown ) , apples contain a compound that boosts sexual arousal , in this case phloridzi , which is quite similar to the female sex hormone called estradiol that plays a large role in sexual arousal			1

researchers in @entity16 have found apples can boost sexual pleasure
the findings were made as part of a study of 731 @entity16 women
each of the women was asked to say how often they consumed apples
they then filled out a *questionnaire* to rate their sexual experiences
those who reported increased sexual pleasure also ate more apples
the reason could be the *presence* of phloridzin in apples , which plays a similar role in sexual arousal in women to the hormone estradiol
