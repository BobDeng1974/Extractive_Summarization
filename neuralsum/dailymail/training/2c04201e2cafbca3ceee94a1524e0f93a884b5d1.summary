by @entity0 a @entity2 boy has returned home to his family after being contained in a special lead - lined hospital room while doctors turned him radioactive , as part of an extreme cancer treatment			1
three - year - old @entity9 , of @entity10 , was last year diagnosed with neuroblastoma , a rare cancer of the developing nerve cells			1
while it ’s rare among the general population , it ’s the most common cancer in children younger than 1 year of age			1
half the cases are metastatic , which means it spreads to the entire body , and that ’s what happened with @entity9			2
brave : three - year - old @entity10 boy @entity9 recently underwent a daring new cancer treatment that turned his person radioactive in an attempt to shrink a collection of tumors that had spread throughout his body diagnosis : a doctor at @entity35 in @entity36 shows how @entity9 's cancer has spread			1
the black parts represent the tumors because of the intensity of the radioactive treatment , the three - year - old has to be confined in this special tank scans of his body showed the cancer was pervasive , so much so that chemotherapy was ruled out as being strong enough to treat it			1
@entity9 's parents then transferred him to @entity35 in @entity36 to try a daring therapy			1
the therapy is called @entity52 and is administered by @entity53 every two hours over the course of one day			0
the drug is inique because only cancerous nerve cells can absorb it			1
' it ’s a way of delivering high energy radiation to tumors not just in one place but to tumors everywhere in the entire body , ' @entity59 oncologist doctor @entity58 told @entity66			2
' i hope that we can get his disease under control with this therapy			0
that we can shrink his tumors			0
' however , the treatment also turns @entity74			0
he must be kept isolated in a lead - shielded room for days to protect his family and the hospital staff			1
a big lead plate is placed in front of his crib to protect staff and other patients			2
@entity9 has been described as ' rambunctious ' and has charmed the doctors and staff at the hospital @entity9 's mother @entity89 watches her son 's progress from a nearby monitor , unable to enter the room because of the radioactivity this lead panel was put up next to the special crib that @entity9 was in to further contain the radioactive waves if the tumors are able to be shrunk , doctors may attempt a bone marrow transplant in the hope of curing @entity9			1
but keeping a three - year - old calm without having any physical contact has proved difficult , and the children who undergo the process need to be sedated			2
we need to give him enough sedation to take the edge off , but not so much that they fall into a deep sleep			0
” said dr. @entity112 , medical director for the @entity113			0
his mother , @entity89 , said the sedative has also helped her			0
' it ’s helping him relax and it then helps me to relax because now i know he ’s not a danger to anybody , ' said @entity89			0
cameras positioned around the room allowed the medical team and family could see how @entity9 was doing inside his container			0
@entity9 has only a 50 percent chance of survival , but doctors are hoping this new therapy will increase that ' i want him to grow up to be a healthy happy normal boy and put this all behind him			1
that ’s my hope , ' his mom said			0
' i hope he kicks cancer in the butt			0
' children like @entity9 have about a 50 percent chance of survival			1
@entity9 will be radioactive for a couple of more weeks , but the radiation levels diminish every day			2
his parents are now able to hold him .			0

@entity9 , 3 , of @entity10 , @entity2 , was diagnosed with neuroblastoma last year
it is a rare cancer of the developing nerve cells but common among young children
the tumors have spread all over his body and chemotherapy was no *longer* an *effective* *option*
he underwent a daring new therapy that uses an iv drug to administer radiation , which attacks only the cancer
@entity9 subsequently becomes radioactive himself and has to be contained in a special lead - lined crib
he has a 50 percent chance of survival
