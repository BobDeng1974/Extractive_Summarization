@entity1 's birth in 2013 sparked a £ 247m sales bonanza for makers of royal memorabilia but experts say the second royal baby is unlikely to have the same effect			1
a more modest sales increase of between £ 60 and £ 70m is predicted , with most of that spent on champagne and cake rather than royal souvenirs			1
however , the baby is expected to make more of an impact in the long term - especially if the child turns out to be a girl			1
' i think it will have an impact on the sales of prosecco and champagne and cake but not much more than that			2
' despite his warning , scores of companies are hoping to cash in on the second royal birth , with plans for items ranging from mugs to beauty boxes afoot			2
leading the charge to the tills is the @entity50 which announced plans for a commemorative £ 5 coin last week , and the @entity53			0
@entity55 @entity54 has designed a special mug , while beauty subscription company @entity57 is offering a ' royally good ' box containing @entity61 showergel and @entity62 among other items			0
bonanza : the birth of @entity1 sparked a £ 247m sales boom between the 1st july and 31st august 13 prince of sales : since then , @entity68 has gone on to replicate his mother 's impact on clothing sales the new baby 's grandfather @entity72 is also hoping for a baby - related boost to his charity coffers via products sold in his @entity78 shop			1
although no official memorabilia is planned , @entity79 , which turns over its profits to the @entity72 ’s @entity81 , already sells organic baby balm for £ 24.95 , a @entity78 baby bear for £ 34.95 and a “ happy and glorious ” baby blanket , featuring guards in red tunics and bearskin hats , priced at £ 94.95			2
the flurry of royal baby memorabilia echoes that sparked by the birth of @entity1 , when the market was flooded by everything from bibs to books			1
other items included royal - themed potties , dummies featuring crowns , bibs proclaiming ' i love @entity101 ' and a book entitled shhh ! do n’t @entity103 ! while there 's no shortage of choice this time around , professor @entity29 says the baby 's long - term impact on retail will be more significant than the initial flurry			1
' when the baby has a certain sweater on , everybody will want to buy that , ' he says , pointing to the ongoing @entity117 and @entity68 effects			0
making his mark : outfits worn by @entity1 such as these @entity121 dungarees , sell out new baby , new coin : the @entity50 is producing a series of coins to mark the new royal birth ' the impact of the baby is going to be over a longer period , particularly if it ’s a girl			1
[ it will be about ] the equipment they use , her clothes , her toys			0
' items that will be available in the short term include an as yet unseen collection of commemorative china from the @entity53			0
the designs will not be unveiled until after the birth and confirmation of the baby ’s sex and production is not likely to be completed until after the baby has been named			0
for @entity68 in july 2013 , the @entity53 produced items including a pillbox ( £ 30 ) , a small loving cup ( £ 39 ) , a dessert plate ( £ 45 ) and a limited - edition loving cup ( £ 195 )			2
more commemorative mugs will come from the @entity154 potteries , who , along with @entity54 , traditionally mark royal events			0
the @entity50 is also to produce a celebratory £ 5 coin - again repeating the routine after @entity1 's birth when it produced 10,000 silver crown - sized £ 5 coins			1
each one cost £ 80 while a further 2,013 22 - carat gold sovereigns , all featuring @entity161 , were sold for £ 800 apiece .			0

retail experts say sales of royal memorabilia are unlikely to top £ 70m
by *comparison* , @entity1 's birth resulted in a £ 247m *splurge*
between july and august 2013 , £ 70m was lavished on souvenirs alone
the newest royal is expected to have a *big* long term impact however
sales boost will be particularly noticeable if the new baby is a girl
