by @entity0 a precious hoard of @entity3 and @entity4 coins has been discovered in a cave where they have lain undisturbed for more than 2,000 years			1
the treasure trove was initially unearthed by a member of the public , who stumbled across four coins in the cavern in @entity12 in the @entity13 , sparking a full - scale excavation of the site			1
experts say the find is highly unusual as it is the first time coins from these two separate civilisations have been buried together			1
the hoard of @entity3 and @entity4 coins which were discovered in the @entity22 's @entity21 and @entity23 in @entity12 in the @entity13 where they have lain undisturbed for more than 2,000 years and the setting itself adds to the mystery surrounding the discovery , as while roman coins have often been found in fields , this is understood to be the first time they have been unearthed in a cave			1
archaeologists discovered 26 coins , including three roman coins which pre-date the invasion of @entity3 in @entity38 , and 20 other gold and silver pieces which are @entity4 and thought to belong to the @entity42 tribe			1
@entity44 archaeologist @entity43 said whoever owned the cache , which has been declared as ‘ treasure ’ by the authorities , was probably a wealthy and influential figure			0
she said : ‘ the coins would suggest a serious amount of wealth and power of the individual who owned them			2
there 's gold in them thar hills : one of the @entity4 gold coins discovered in @entity12 , @entity13 ‘ coins were used more as a symbol of power and status during the @entity4 , rather than for buying and selling staple foods and supplies			1
was an individual simply hiding his ‘ best stuff ’ for safe keeping ? or , perhaps speculating , in the hope that the value would increase in the future , like a modern - day @entity74 ? ‘ the situation of the cave ca n’t be ignored either			2
could it have been a sacred place to the @entity4 peoples that was taboo to enter in everyday life , making it a safe place that would ensure that person ’s valuables were protected ? ’ the largest hoard of @entity4 gold and silver coins ever found in @entity3 was discovered by an amateur archaeologist in 2000 near @entity86 in south east @entity87			1
more than 5,000 coins and , jewellery and a silver - gilt roman parade helmet were among the treasures discovered during that excavation			1
coins and a @entity95 brooch that were initially unearthed by a member of the public @entity98 , the @entity99 ’s curator of @entity4 and @entity3 coins , said that while this latest find at @entity22 ’s @entity103 does not quite match the @entity86 discovery , it is ‘ exciting ’			1
he said : ‘ although this is a much smaller hoard than the similar finds made at @entity86 in 2000 , this has been declared treasure and is an exciting discovery given the puzzling location in a cave and the fact that it lies beyond the main circulation area of the coinage			0
’ the project was also unusual because , for the first time , the @entity44 enlisted the help of wounded ex-soldiers returning from @entity118 to assist with the excavation			0
the @entity122 ’s @entity121 project provides recuperation through field archaeology for service personnel injured in ton the frontline			0
@entity128 , who spent 10 years in the military and was part of the excavation team , said : ‘ this was the first archaeological excavation i ’ve ever taken part in and it was brilliant			0
‘ i was working at the back of the cave , in the dark , and i was the first person to find a coin - a silver coin			2
‘ it was so exciting and really helped to lift spirits , after several fruitless days of hard graft			0
my first dig and this is what i found			2
the experience working alongside archaeologists and other veterans was inspiring			2
’ @entity44 archaeologist @entity43 said whoever owned the cache , which has been declared as ; treasure ' by the authorities , was probably a wealthy and influential figure @entity121 ’s sergeant @entity152 added : ‘ with the inherent skills of the soldier - an appreciation of landscape , topography and deposits in the ground - archaeology is a discipline that is perfect for service personnel			0
‘ through projects like the excavation at @entity12 , archaeology can help former service personnel to address their ailments and help in their recovery			0
’ the @entity42 tribe was made up of a number of other small clans who would come together for the common good			0
the coins have been cleaned by conservation specialists at the @entity99 and @entity175 and will go on permanent display at @entity177 later this year .			0

four coins found by member of the public sparked full - scale *search*
archaeologists discovered three roman coins which pre-date the invasion of @entity3 in @entity38
site of coins may have been a sacred place to the @entity4 peoples
