even after the passion has faded a little , a goodnight kiss does n’t seem too much to expect from your partner			0
but according to research , it probably is			2
eighty per cent of couples no longer kiss each other good night , it found – because they ’re so focused on getting to sleep			2
looking away : the survey of 2,000 couples found that 90 per cent do not say ' i love you ' before they turn the lights out and 46 per cent of @entity15 sleep with their backs to their partners a quarter said they can not bear their partner to touch them in bed , while 90 per cent do n’t even manage to say ‘ i love you ’ before they turn out the lights			1
and such is their mission to get a good night ’s rest that 46 per cent said they sleep with their backs to their partner			1
but that might not be as bad as it sounds			0
@entity34 , a relationship psychologist , said the back - to - back position shows innocence and trust – and body language during sleep can not be faked			1
she said : ‘ inevitably , once the first flush of lust wears off , with couples naked and entwined , it is more likely that the need for a good night ’s sleep predominates , so sleeping back to back becomes a favourable position in bed			2
’ indeed , only 1 per cent of the 2,000 couples surveyed by @entity50 said they sleep in what the researchers called the ‘ heroic romantic movie scene sleeping ’ position , with the man lying on his back and the woman ’s head on his chest			1
miss @entity34 said : ‘ couples fall into habitual ways of sleeping together that suits their personalities and personal preferences			0
' if something changes in how they sleep together , this can … cause concern for the other partner			0
’ real life ? the ' heroic romantic movie scene sleeping ' position famously portrayed in the @entity73 film when @entity74 ( @entity75 and @entity76 pictured ) , is just a position for the camera			0
