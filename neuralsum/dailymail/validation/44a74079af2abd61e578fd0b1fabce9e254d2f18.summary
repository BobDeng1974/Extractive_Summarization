@entity0 said this week it could take £ 60million man @entity2 a year to adapt to life at @entity4 - but it took the @entity7 boss 59 minutes to decide he had seen enough at @entity8			1
another unconvincing display was brought prematurely to an end moments after @entity11 flopped a hopeless right - wing cross into a visitors ' box bereft of team - mates			2
but it could have been a different story if @entity11 - hauled off at half - time in saturday 's 2 - 0 win over @entity19 - had made his mark inside the opening minute			1
@entity2 trudges off the field after another disappointing performance for @entity7 @entity7 's record £ 60m signing has struggled to adapt after a bright start to his @entity4 career @entity11 was marshalled out of the game by @entity29 midfielder @entity28 ( left ) the @entity30 was sent clean through after a mistake by home defender @entity32 - but he inexplicably hesitated with the goal at his mercy and the chance was lost			1
it was destined to be @entity11 's best chance of making an impression			0
he was afforded plenty of space on the right flank but worked in fits and starts and was well marshalled by home pair @entity28 and @entity45			0
when he was too easily robbed in his own half one minute before the interval it sparked a charge upfield from @entity50 which ended in a clear - cut chance for @entity53 in the visitors ' box			0
the @entity56 international is ushered back to the dug out after being substituted on 59minutes @entity0 hauled @entity11 off early for a second consecutive @entity59 game @entity11 did offer the occasional hint of quality in the second period , not least in the 54th minute when he provided the cross from which @entity65 then @entity64 brought fine saves out of @entity67			1
but all too often the fickers were extinguished by those lackadaisical losses of possession of inexplicable passes into empty space			0
and shortly after one wasted opportunity too many , @entity11 was substituted again with the home fans ' chants of ' what a waste of money ' ringing in his ears			0
@entity64 ( right ) scored the winner as @entity7 took their recent run to two losses from the last 22 games @entity84 has words with @entity86 after the pair appeared to spit at each other during the game			2

@entity7 defeated @entity29 1 - 0 at @entity8
record signing @entity2 was substituted after 59minutes
@entity0 has claimed @entity56 star could need a year to adapt
