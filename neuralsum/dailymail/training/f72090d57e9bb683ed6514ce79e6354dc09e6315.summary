he was spotted at the @entity3 before @entity9 's game against @entity25 and in the directors ' box watching the 2 - 0 defeat after flying into @entity6 on owner @entity8 's private plane			1
it is hoped @entity5 will officially be @entity10 's replacement before the @entity34 tie against @entity35 at the weekend			1
here 's looking at you : @entity5 and @entity8 share a glance in the directors ' box at the @entity3 during @entity9 's match against @entity25 taking his seat : @entity5 ( second left ) in the directors ' box at the @entity3 as @entity9 owner @entity8 ( bottom right ) makes his way up in position : @entity5 and @entity47 before @entity9 's game at @entity25 entrance : @entity5 ( right ) and @entity8 arrive at the @entity3 ahead of @entity9 's game against @entity25 new wave : @entity8 sheepishly acknowledges the camera as he and @entity5 walk into the @entity3 @entity52 reserves - 2008 - 2010 @entity53 - november 2010 - present honours @entity55 : 2011 , 2012 @entity56 : 2013 league record sir @entity12 , @entity5 's former manager at @entity52 , reportedly told him to steer clear of the club and @entity8 after three months of chaos finally led to the departure of @entity10 last friday			1
but @entity62 understands @entity9 chairman @entity13 held further talks with the @entity53 manager ’s representatives and it seems that has convinced him to move to @entity67 , despite the former @entity52 striker 's reservations			1
@entity5 is a patron of the @entity70 , who led the stand against @entity74 regime			2
on the pitch , the 40 - year - old has led @entity53 to the @entity0 title twice , in 2011 and 2012 , and to the @entity56 last year			2
@entity13 has also been authorised by @entity8 to offer a hefty january transfer budget that will extend to ‘ whatever it takes to secure survival ’ , according to one source close to @entity8			1
reports in @entity83 say @entity5 , who has a contract until july has not committed to leaving @entity53			2
thumbs up : @entity9 owner @entity8 has managed to bag his first choice , @entity5 , as boss time 's up : @entity10 was sacked last friday after a chaotic last three months in charge at @entity9 only one @entity0 has managed in the @entity55 and that did not have a happy ending			1
@entity91 took charge of @entity93 in 1999 but lasted for less than a season as the @entity95 were relegated from the @entity96 ( table below is all competitions ) two more @entity0 have managed in @entity99 , although both were in the championship			2
@entity102 was in charge of @entity104 for just 57 days , registering one win , three draws and six defeats in his time there and famously storming out of the club 's @entity109 after he was made to go on stage and wear a stocking on his head , and a @entity115 wig , and dance on stage			0
@entity118 was a disaster at @entity120 in the first half of last season , beginning a campaign which was to end in relegation to @entity125			0
the club 's ceo @entity126 told @entity128 : ' @entity5 did not leave us a message about it one way or the other			2
he is still our manager , at least until the summer			0
' he would not comment on the information that @entity5 will be heading to @entity99 and that he can be presented as new @entity9 boss already			1
' it 's nothing new to say about this situation from the club side			0
we still speak regularly with @entity5 and both parties know well how we have each other			2
' former @entity83 striker @entity142 , now a pundit , tweeted : ' will try to keep you updated ! ca n't still believe @entity5 is going to @entity9			1
against everything he has said / stand for			0
' this a staggering volte face if @entity148 is to be believed , as he went on @entity150 earlier in the week and said : ' it wo n't happen			0
i understand that @entity5 wo n't pick a club , he will pick a owner so @entity9 wo n't happen			1
' @entity5 did an interview some weeks ago and said if he goes to @entity99 he will be very aware of what owner he 's going to work with			1
based on what i know there 's no chance he 'll go to @entity9			2
' @entity16 and @entity17 have been lined up as insurance options in case @entity5 turns down the job			1
assistant manager @entity165 and first - team coach @entity166 are taking charge of the @entity169 game at @entity25			0
until the @entity0 is confirmed , it remains business as usual for @entity165 and @entity172			0
after the 2 - 0 defeat by @entity25 on @entity169 , @entity165 said : ' although @entity166 and myself and the rest of the staff know it is only temporary , the last thing i said to the players that they made me feel immensely proud of the performance they put in			1
' i am really unsure whether they knew or not ( that @entity5 was at the stadium )			0
breaking the deadlock : @entity186 netted @entity25 's first of two goals just two minutes before time ' there was no talk of it on the team bus and the hotel and in the dressing - room , so i would not totally unsure about that			0
' @entity165 added : ' whoever comes in , obviously there is an important month coming up , so if he can add to it , make the squad better , then all well and good , but i believe the team are good enough to stay in the @entity55			0
' there have been no indications as to whether any of @entity10 's former backroom staff would be kept on once a new manager has been appointed			1
' no , ( i have heard ) nothing at all , ' said @entity165			0
taking charge : @entity165 took charge of @entity9 for their draw with @entity210 and defeat to @entity25 ' i am contracted to the club until the owner or chairman tell me different			1
' i will be in work tomorrow as usual			0
' coaches and managers in football know that it 's a precarious job and we just get on with it			0
there is no problem there , it is business as usual			0
' @entity227 's back and smiling at @entity228 @entity10 , the man @entity5 seems set to replace at @entity9 , was pictured at @entity229 ahead of @entity228 's @entity96 match against @entity231			1
@entity10 , who played for @entity228 , was greeted by @entity233 @entity232 and it seemed to take his mind off the acrimony surrounding his sacking by @entity8			2
smiles better : @entity10 ( left ) is greeted by @entity239 @entity232 at @entity229			0
