by @entity0 in @entity1 and @entity3 reporter published : 12:58 est , 6 may 2013 updated : 14:55 est , 6 may 2013 stand down : @entity4 , the number two diplomat in @entity6 at the time of the @entity9 attacks , says special operations troops were told to stand down the former number two diplomat in @entity6 has told members of @entity13 that @entity15 @entity14 in @entity16 denied @entity15 commandos permission to fly to the scene of the slaughter to intervene			1
@entity4 gave private testimony in april about the events of september 11 , 2012 , and will testify in public during a @entity1 hearing on wednesday			1
@entity4 is one of three @entity25 ' whistle blowers ' expected to appear publicly in front of the @entity27 to speak out about the @entity29 's response to the attacks that killed ambassador @entity31 and three other @entity15			1
according to a partial transcript released monday and first reported by @entity33 , @entity4 said a lieutenant colonel who was readying his team in the @entity6 capital of @entity37 , was told to stand down instead of boarding a military c - 130 aircraft bound for @entity9			2
additionally , the military was unable to scramble fighter jets to engage the attackers because air support was too far away			2
@entity4 believes fighters could have saved lives by dispersing the @entity6 attackers			1
@entity46 , the special operations command on the @entity16 continent , which answers to the @entity49 , reportedly delivered the order			0
witness : @entity52 , a veteran officer of the @entity53 - was in @entity37 on the night of the attack when he received a distress call from @entity31 tragic : the september 11 , 2012 , assault on the @entity57 in @entity9 resulted in the deaths of ambassador @entity31 and three other @entity15			1
the special ops officer , @entity4 testified , ‘ got a phone call from @entity46 which said , " you ca n't go now , you do n't have the authority to go now			2
" and so they missed the flight ... they were told not to board the flight , so they missed it			0
' he added that his aim was to fill the scheduled @entity71 flight with special - forces rescuers , specifically because security measures at the @entity9 outpost were known to be lax			0
‘ we fully intended for those guys to go , ’ @entity4 said , ‘ because we had already essentially stripped ourselves of our security presence , or our security capability , to the bare minimum			2
’ but ultimately , he insisted , ‘ they were told not to board the flight			0
’ the @entity25 gave the order , according to @entity4 ’ recollection of remarks from the @entity46 commander , whom he identified only as lieutenant colonel @entity86			1
‘ i still remember @entity86 , ’ @entity4 recalled			2
‘ he said , " i have never been so embarrassed in my life that a @entity25 officer has bigger balls than somebody in the military			2
’ while mortars and rocket - propelled grenades rained down on the @entity15 outpost , no @entity15 military forces came to the rescue of the consulate ’s personnel			1
four @entity15 perished , including @entity31			1
@entity4 said he believed a quickly scrambled fighter jet could have prevented additional casualties after the first wave of terrorist attacks , which the @entity104 determined almost immediately came from the militant group @entity105 and other @entity108 - related @entity107 rebels			1
‘ if we had been able to scramble a fighter or aircraft or two over @entity9 as quickly as possible after the attack commenced , i believe there would not have been a mortar attack on the annex in the morning because i believe the @entity6 would have split , ’ he testified			0
mourned : ambassador @entity31 and foreign service officer @entity116 were both killed inside the @entity15 consulate in @entity9 , @entity6 defenders : @entity119 , left , and @entity120 , right , were former @entity122 seamen who responded to the call for help from the consulate and were killed in a counter-attack by the terrorists ‘ they would have been scared to death that we would have gotten a laser on them and killed them			1
’ in the wake of the attack , the @entity135 administration repeatedly claimed that a @entity140 video that mocked the @entity141 prophet @entity138 angered a spontaneous mob of protesters outside the consulate , and that the protest turned unpredictably deadly			0
@entity15 ambassador to the @entity148 @entity147 appeared on five sunday morning political talk shows on september 16 , repeating that line from a set of unclassified talking points provided by the @entity153			1
reporting from @entity154 has since established that those talking points originated as a frank description from the @entity104 of a coordinated , pre-planned terror attack			0
following a meeting of administration deputies , the conservative magazine has reported , the talking points were reduced to the inconclusive report that informed @entity162 ’s television appearances – sanitized of all references to premeditation and @entity107 terrorism			0
information trickling out of the @entity135 administration has suggested in recent weeks that the @entity153 was aware from the beginning that the @entity9 consulate was under attack by organized terrorists			0
@entity4 ’ testimony reinforces that line of thought			2
allegation : one of the @entity9 ' whistle - blowers ' will reportedly claim on wednesday that then - secretary of state @entity175 tried to silence the @entity25 's own counterterrorism bureau ‘ i was in communications with @entity1 all night long , ’ he said			1
‘ i was reporting all night long what was happening to @entity1 by telephone			0
’ ' i thought it was a terrorist attack from the get - go			0
i think everybody in the mission thought it was a terrorist attack from the beginning , ' @entity4 said , according to excerpts of interviews released to @entity33 ' @entity190			1
@entity4 , a 22 - year veteran of the foreign service , says he was furious when @entity148 ambassador @entity147 appeared on tv five days after the attack and declared that @entity15 ambassador @entity31 and three other @entity15 died as part of an anti-american ' demonstration ' by @entity6			1
' i 've never been as embarrassed in my life , in my career , as on that day , ' he told @entity13 interviewers			0
he added : ' i never reported a demonstration			0
i reported an attack on the consulate			0
@entity31 's last report - if you want to say his final report - is , " @entity208 , we are under attack			1
" ' asked by congressional investigators if military authorities ever considered sending an f - 16 fighter jet into the airspace over @entity9 , @entity4 said he asked twice and heard the same negative answer both times			1
‘ i talked with the @entity216 , lt. col. @entity217 , ’ @entity4 said , ‘ and i asked him , " is there anything coming ? " and he said that the nearest fighter planes were [ at ] @entity223 [ @entity224 , in @entity225 ] , that he had been told that it would take two to three hours to get them airborne , but that there were no tanker assets near enough to support a flight from @entity223			2
’ @entity231 , who was the regional security officer in @entity6 , also testified on @entity232 on october 10 @entity4 later mentioned ‘ the second time that night ’ that he asked @entity217 ' is there anything coming , is there anything out there to help our people from , you know , big military ? and the answer , again , was the same as before			2
… the answer was , " it 's too far away , there are no tankers , there is nothing , there is nothing that could respond			0
" ' another witness of the attacks , @entity252 , a @entity254 veteran and a @entity25 counter-terrorism adviser , plans to testify that then - secretary of state @entity175 tried to leave her department 's own counter-terrorism bureau out of the loop as government in the hours after the attacks as officials figured out how to respond to the attacks			1
the third witness is @entity231 , a former @entity25 diplomatic security officer in charge of regional security in @entity6			0
the wednesday afternoon hearing before the @entity27 will include testimony from @entity4 and two other whistle - blowers who have first - person knowledge of what happened on the ground			1
' clearly , there was a political decision to say something different than what was reasonable to say , ' @entity27 chairman @entity273 told @entity190			0
he said @entity25 and @entity153 officials launched ' what is a misinformation campaign , at best , and a cover - up at worst			1
' ' cover - up ' : congressman @entity273 , the @entity283 in charge of the @entity9 attack hearings , says the testimony from the whistle blowers could reveal an @entity29 ' cover - up ' political fallout for the @entity135 administration could be devastating , although not as much as it might have been if the testimony had been heard in september or october – before the 2012 presidential election			1
@entity135 claimed during one presidential debate with former @entity283 nominee @entity294 that he designated the @entity9 attack ‘ an act of terrorism ’ during a press conference on the day after it occurred			0
a transcript of the president ’s remarks from that september 12 event show that he used the word ‘ terrorism , ’ but not specifically in reference to the @entity9 attack			0
during a @entity33 interview taped just hours after that press conference , 60 minutes correspondent @entity306 asked @entity135 to comment on early reports that armed militia men carried out the assault on the @entity15 consulate			2
‘ do you believe that this was a terrorist attack ? ’ @entity306 asked the president			0
‘ well , it 's too early to know exactly how this came about , what group was involved , ’ @entity135 replied , ‘ but obviously it was an attack on @entity15			2
’ @entity33 broadcast that interview only on november 4 , one day before @entity135 was re-elected .			0
