by @entity0 published : 23:25 est , 28 march 2012 updated : 04:47 est , 29 march 2012 thousands of well - qualified students face being denied places at popular universities as deep cuts are announced in the numbers they are allowed to recruit			1
three quarters of universities face losing up to 900 first - year undergraduates compared with last year			1
the recruitment limits for courses beginning in the autumn were announced as the @entity14 battles to rein in the soaring costs of offering student loans to cover tuition fees of up to £ 9,000 - a - year			1
cuts : thousands of students face missing out on places at their chosen university university bosses condemned the squeeze on places at a time of soaring youth unemployment and warned that talented students now face missing out on places at sought - after universities			1
figures published yesterday by the @entity31 suggest that 98 out of 129 universities face a cut in their first - year student numbers this autumn			1
some 34 institutions face losing at least 10 per cent of their numbers compared with last year , including the @entity37 with 12.6 per cent			2
universities have an opportunity to counter the projected cut in student numbers by targeting applicants with @entity44 grades or better at a-level			1
this is because ministers have relaxed recruitment quotas for applicants with these grades , allowing universities to give places to as many as they can attract			0
but only the most elite institutions are expected to gain significant numbers of students in this way			0
@entity37 is set to lose 12.6 per cent of it 's student intake in september many leading institutions currently stand to see a drop in their first - year intake unless they aggressively recruit students with @entity44 grades or better			1
these include some in the prestigious @entity63 and 1994 groups of institutions , such as @entity66 , with an estimated cut of 6.4 per cent , @entity68 with 5.1 per cent , @entity69 with 4.9 per cent and @entity70 with 4.6 per cent			0
under a @entity14 policy aimed at driving down student fees , about 10,000 places have been redistributed to local further education colleges			0
the @entity76 and @entity77 , for example , will see a massive 1,867 per cent increase in places			0
but fears were raised last night that bright applicants who miss the @entity44 grade threshold could find it more difficult to win places			2
universities are thought to be making fewer initial offers at these lower grades			0
all offers that have already been made will be respected but institutions will have less leeway to help borderline candidates who just miss their conditional offers			0
universities can counter the projected cut in student numbers by targeting applicants with @entity44 grades or better at @entity45 professor @entity98 , vice-chancellor of the @entity99 , said : ' the information released today rubber stamps the fact that many excellent students will be denied places at their first choice universities			1
' he criticised a ' push to cut - price education ' after 20,000 degree course places were stripped from universities and diverted to institutions charging the lowest fees			1
' furthermore , with uncapped student places restricted only to applicants with a-level grades of @entity44 or above there is every chance that some excellent institutions will lose further places , ' he added			2
' there are only so many @entity44 students to go around and they are likely to be snapped up by a few self - declared " elite " institutions , able to rely on historical brand prestige to attract applications			1
' any university losing @entity44 students will not be allowed to take on students with different grades , such as two bs and an a , to take their place			2
' this means that many talented students will be denied places at highly regarded universities			2
' minister for universities and @entity136 @entity135 mp has defended the policy professor @entity98 , who is chairman of the so - called 1994 group of institutions , added : ' restricting competition only to self - selecting elites and cut - price providers reduces the level of choice available to the vast majority of students			1
' in total , there will be 10,910 fewer places available in universities and colleges than in 2011			0
the forecast student numbers for 2012 assume universities maintain their share of students with @entity44 grades , or the equivalent for other qualifications			1
institutions face even more severe cuts if they lose these top students to rivals seeking to shore up their own numbers			2
@entity76 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 are among those estimated to see an increase in places			0
this is partly because they have been granted a share of 1,000 places aimed at poorer applicants who miss out on top @entity44 grades			0
@entity177 , general secretary of the @entity178 , said : ' at a time when record numbers of people are out of work , the government should be making it easier for people to access education			0
' axing grants for college students , tripling university fees and slashing teaching budgets and student places is exactly what the government should not be doing			0
' universities minister @entity135 said : ' we want a student - focused higher education sector , more choice over where to study and a renewed focus on the quality of the student experience			2
' that 's why we 're freeing up centralised number controls , improving information for prospective students and driving a new focus on the academic experience			0
' recent figures suggest that taxpayers will be burdened with £ 191billion of debt as the government subsidises student loans to cover fees of up to £ 9,000 - a - year and living costs			1
officials have estimated that the amount lent to students will balloon to record levels by 2047 before the @entity219 starts to recoup the losses from graduates .			0
