@entity0 would not still be a @entity2 player if previous managers had their way - knock - backs which have fuelled his determination to succeed under @entity7			1
a product of the @entity2 academy , the midfielder made his debut for the club as a late substitute in the @entity14 at they won 1 - 0 at @entity16 in november 2008			1
remarkably , it took nigh on six years - and loan spells at five different clubs - before finally making his first league appearance for the club , which even more astonishingly came for the 23 - year - old as a starter in saturday 's north @entity26 derby at @entity27			1
@entity0 gets stuck into @entity28 during his @entity30 debut in the @entity26 derby the youngster ( centre ) celebrates his stunning @entity35 goal with @entity36 and @entity37 the 1 - 1 draw capped a whirlwind week for @entity0 , which began with playing for the under - 21s at @entity41 and ended at the @entity42 , via a match - changing wonder goal as @entity45 were edged out of the @entity35 3 - 1			1
' it 's been a massive week for me with three games in five days , ' he said			0
' i played for the reserves on monday , then against @entity45 in the @entity35 on wednesday and here			0
' that @entity45 match was just his fifth @entity2 appearance and a first opportunity to feature under @entity7 - one which would no doubt have come sooner had it not been for injury curtailing an impressive pre-season			1
@entity0 thought ' oh , here we go again ' at that point , but was also confident chances would be forthcoming under the former @entity61 international after seeing him in action at @entity64			1
' i thought his appointment was promising , ' he said			0
' he 's the type of @entity67 that if you 're training well and playing well then you 'll get a chance to play			0
@entity7 cut an animated figure on the touchline during his @entity72 debut @entity0 admits he might have left the club if @entity7 had not become manager ' that 's important , especially for me as a homegrown lad			1
' there are not many managers in the @entity30 willing to put homegrown players in and trust them			2
' that is certainly a marked change from previous regimes , when desire and self - belief was the only thing keeping @entity0 at @entity86 ' obviously there have been times when i have questioned whether i would have to move away , " he said			2
' i 've had a few opportunities to leave , but i wanted to play for @entity2 so bad that i never really wanted to think about leaving			2
' i wanted to stay and give it a go and see what happened			0
like i said , the change in manager helped me			0
@entity96 ( no.5 ) battles for the ball with @entity27 striker @entity98 @entity99 ( right ) started alongside @entity100 defender @entity96 at the centre of defence ' if previous managers were still in charge , maybe i would n't be here			0
' @entity7 was full of praise for @entity0 after his impressive @entity30 debut on a night which saw @entity96 start alongside @entity99			1
there has been talk of the @entity100 having a strained relationship with the @entity2 boss - suggestions which perplexed the former defender			1
' no , no , no , ' @entity7 said			0
' maybe because i pick players in different games but any problem with @entity96 , this is wrong			2
' we have a lot of games ahead and need to see and analyse the performance and analyse the situation after the game , maybe tired , maybe some problem , and after you need to manage			0
we have a strong squad and this is important			0
