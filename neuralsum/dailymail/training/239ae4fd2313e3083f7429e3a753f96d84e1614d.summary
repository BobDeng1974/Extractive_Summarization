@entity0 may have thought it was @entity2 as he was appointed to the same game at the same stage of the @entity5 four years on			1
@entity6 easily beat @entity7 3 - 0 in 2010 , but he faced a sterner test this time			1
the most contentious moment for @entity0 came in the 54th minute as @entity10 appeared to restore @entity6 's lead			1
handball : @entity0 indicates why he disallowed @entity10 's strike which looked to have given @entity6 the lead unhappy : @entity6 coach @entity15 argues with @entity0 and the fourth official @entity16 after the decision good call : although on first viewing the goal looked legitimate , @entity0 rightly spotted @entity10 's handball however , @entity0 's assistant @entity21 flagged to indicate that the forward had controlled the ball with his upper arm			1
@entity0 disallowed the goal and cautioned the @entity27 forward			1
replays were not 100 per cent clear but i thought that the decision was correct as the striker deliberately put his arm out and the ball was controlled from it			2
some have suggested that any doubt is supposed to be given to the attacker			2
that is not correct unless in an offside situation			2
@entity6 were perhaps more unfortunate in the first half when @entity10 was tripped when clean through but @entity0 , with a poor view , waved appeals aside			1
protest : the @entity27 forward was convinced his goal should have been allowed to stand outrage : @entity10 complains to assistant referee @entity44 but the @entity46 officials got it right 1min : blows his whistle to kick off the last 16 match between @entity6 and @entity7 in @entity50			1
4min : @entity51 commits a late challenge on @entity53 which must risk a booking but decides to just award a free - kick			0
5min : @entity53 responds in kind , bringing down @entity57 but again only awards a free - kick			0
11min : @entity7 appeal for a penalty when @entity61 goes down under @entity63 's challenge but is not impressed			1
13min : this time it is @entity6 's turn to claim a spot - kick when @entity10 tumbles while being chased by @entity66 but again refuses the appeals			1
17min : books @entity69 after a clear handball meaning the @entity7 full - back would miss his next match			0
18min : opening goal for @entity6 - correct decision not to award offside			2
23min : speaks severely to @entity57 after the @entity27 is involved in an altercation with @entity76			0
28min : @entity6 are unhappy when two crunching challenges on @entity57 by @entity78 and @entity79 do not bring yellow cards			2
40min : books @entity78 for a foul on @entity57 - meaning he too would be out of any quarter - final			0
disallows a goal by @entity10 and books the @entity6 forward after assistant flags that he controlled a cross with upper arm			1
60min : books @entity95 for bringing down @entity79 - he too would miss quarter - final			0
90min : blows for end of normal time with score 1 - 1			0
91min : awards a free - kick near the @entity7 penalty area after @entity69 brings down @entity10			1
93min : books @entity102 for a high challenge on keeper @entity105			0
95min : blows up for a foul by @entity57 when the @entity27 nearly breaks through			0
102min : books @entity107 for cynically bringing down @entity63			0
105min : bizarrely books @entity110 when it appeared @entity112 had run into him			0
120min : blows for the end of extra-time and signals for penalties .			0

@entity46 referee @entity0 rules out @entity10 's 54th minute strike in @entity6
@entity6 complained but replays show @entity0 was spot on
hosts more *unlucky* in first half when @entity10 could have had a penalty
