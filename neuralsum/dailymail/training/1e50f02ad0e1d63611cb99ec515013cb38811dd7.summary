@entity1 ’s one concession to the celebration of his 100th cap will be to lead out the @entity5 team with his sons @entity6 and @entity8			1
all being well , it will happen at @entity10 next month against @entity11			2
he will be the ninth @entity13 footballer to reach his century and , at 29 , the youngest by nearly three years			1
there will still be time to train his sights on @entity19 ’s record of 125 , though @entity20 plans to set more immediate targets for his captain			1
‘ he should concentrate on @entity35 2016 — a ) make sure we get there , b ) make certain if we are making any improvements that they continue , and c ) take that responsibility			2
‘ hopefully , if it all works out and we do qualify and are playing a bit better when we get there , i think it will be quite easy for him to take the next step			0
i would n’t worry too much about the next 25 caps			0
get the next 10 in			0
’ the @entity5 manager speaks with genuine affection for @entity1 , the man he chose to succeed @entity51 , and staunchly backed him when he came under fire for his performances			1
in @entity58 , his free - kick won the game			2
he was always the player most likely to score and yet he was criticised for missing chances , just as he had done against @entity61 last thursday			2
@entity1 looked the player most likely to score and was @entity5 's saviour against @entity58 with a free kick @entity5 manager @entity20 says he would prefer @entity1 concentrates on @entity65 rather than records it is hard to argue with the facts			1
he has 43 goals in 99 games for his country			0
sir @entity73 ’s 49 - goal record is also in view			1
‘ as i ’m edging closer , i think about it , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ but i ’m a strong believer that if it ’s going to happen , it will			0
when that time comes i ’ll be delighted			0
at the minute it ’s a matter of wanting to score for the three points			0
’ @entity1 has watched @entity79 , @entity51 , @entity80 and @entity81 reach 100 caps during his @entity5 career , which started in a friendly against @entity85 in 2003			1
‘ it is a great honour , ’ he said ‘ i ’ll be looking forward to it and excited about the next game			0
there ’s no special plans but my two boys will walk on to the pitch with me			0
‘ it is a fantastic achievement to play for your country for so long			0
i remember @entity79 , @entity51 , @entity81 and @entity80 getting their hundred caps and how much it meant to them			0
@entity1 could close in on @entity19 's record of 125 ( left ) and @entity79 's 115 ( right ) sir @entity73 's ( standing in front of @entity1 and wife @entity105 at @entity106 ) 49 - goal record is also in view born : @entity109 , october 24 1985 ( 28 ) playing position : forward 2002 - 2004 : @entity113 ( 67 lg apps , 15 gls ) 2004 - now : @entity115 ( 313 , 161 ) 2003 - now : @entity5 ( 99 , 43 ) ‘ you do n’t think you ’ll achieve this when you first get into the team , but over the last two or three years , when i got into the 70s , 80s and 90s , then you know it is going to happen			1
i ’ll be the youngest but i started younger than most			2
’ @entity1 made his @entity113 debut at 16 , against @entity125 in august 2002			1
twelve years and more than 600 senior games later , he is warming to his leadership roles as captain of @entity115 and @entity5			1
for his country , he has inherited the penalty - taking responsibilities as well as the armband from @entity51 and produced a free - kick in @entity133 to rekindle memories of the days when captain @entity79 stepped up to rescue the team with his dead - ball excellence			1
@entity20 said : ‘ when i came into the job two years ago , i did n’t quite know what to expect from him			1
my knowledge of him was shaped by tv , radio and newspapers			0
he is a very different person than i thought he would be ; very driven and professional			0
@entity1 made his debut at @entity113 at the age of 16 but is to be 29 and knocking on the door of @entity13 records @entity5 captain and forward @entity1 celebrates his goal against @entity58 during the @entity65 qualifying win ‘ since he has had the captaincy , he has taken on even more responsibility and to get 100 caps for your country is some achievement because of the competition you face for your shirt			1
‘ he has taken a bashing over the years and that has toughened him up			0
some players get to 34 - 35 and do n’t play anywhere near as much football as he has played			0
’ the @entity5 boss also praised him for taking over smoothly from @entity51			1
‘ both engage very well in particular with the younger players and give them the benefit of their knowledge and experience , ’ said @entity20			2
‘ both are unbelievably passionate about @entity5			2
you knew every time they went out on the field they would sweat everything for @entity5			2
that does n’t always mean they had great games but you do n’t have to look at them and say , “ he ’s not at it today ” or , “ he ’s not taking it seriously ”			0
that is a great quality @entity182 has			0
’ @entity20 acknowledges that @entity1 has taken over smoothly from former captain @entity51			1

@entity1 wants to lead @entity5 out for his 100th cap with his sons
the @entity115 star looks set to become the youngest @entity5 player to ever hit the 100 - cap target at the age of 29 next month
@entity5 captain @entity1 has @entity19 's record of 125 in his sights too
@entity20 says @entity1 should concentrate on @entity65 first
