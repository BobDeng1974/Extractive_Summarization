he has spent much of his first fortnight on the job hobnobbing with world leaders and @entity4			0
but yesterday pope @entity5 visited a prison to wash and kiss the feet of convicted criminals			1
he broke with tradition to hold a major @entity11 service at @entity13 young offenders ’ prison in @entity15 , telling 50 inmates : ‘ i ’m happy to be with you			2
do n’t give up hope			0
’ the foot washing on @entity20 echoes a @entity22 passage in which @entity23 honours his 12 disciples before his crucifixion			2
in a first for a @entity5 , he attended to the feet of two woman prisoners			2
several of the 12 were also @entity50			0
pope @entity5 already has officials on the back foot with his lack of regard for protocol			1
he has insisted he will not live in the lavish @entity57 apartments			0
on seeing them , he said : ‘ but there is room for 300 people in here			0
’ at a mass in @entity64 yesterday , he told priests : ‘ we need to go out			0
to the outskirts where there is suffering , bloodshed , blindness that longs for sight , and prisoners in thrall to many evil masters			0
’ those who do not , he said , ‘ become merely dealers in antiques and collectibles , instead of pastors , ending up dissatisfied and sad ’			0
previous popes would carry out the foot - washing ritual on holy thursday in @entity15 's grand @entity82 basilica and the 12 people chosen for the ritual were priests to represent the 12 disciples many of them were gypsies or @entity90 migrants , and the @entity91 said the 12 selected for the rite were n't necessarily @entity93			1
because the inmates were mostly minors - the facility houses inmates aged 14 - 21 - the @entity91 and @entity98 @entity97 limited media access inside			0
but @entity100 carried the @entity101 live , and @entity5 told the detainees that @entity23 washed the feet of his disciples on the eve of his crucifixion in a gesture of love and service			1
' this is a symbol , it is a sign - washing your feet means i am at your service , ' @entity5 told the youngsters			1
this is what @entity23 teaches us			0
this is what i do			0
and i do it with my heart			0
i do this with my heart because it is my duty , as a priest and bishop i must be at your service			0
' later , the @entity91 released a limited video of the ritual , showing @entity5 washing black feet , white feet , male feet , female feet and even a foot with tattoos			0
as archbishop of @entity37 , the former cardinal @entity5 would celebrate the ritual foot - washing in jails , hospitals or hospices - part of his ministry to the poorest and most marginalized of society			1
it 's a message that he is continuing now that he is pope , saying he wants a church ' for the poor			1
' previous popes would carry out the foot - washing ritual on holy thursday in @entity15 's grand @entity82 basilica and the 12 people chosen for the ritual were priests to represent the 12 disciples			1
that @entity5 would include women in this re-enactment is symbolically noteworthy given the insistence of some in the church that the ritual be reserved for men only given that @entity23 ' disciples were all male , and that the @entity93 priesthood that evolved from the original 12 disciples is restricted to men			1
' the pope 's washing the feet of women is hugely significant , because including women in this part of the @entity101 has been frowned on - and even banned - in some dioceses , ' said the rev. @entity172 , a @entity173 priest and author of " the @entity175			1
" ' it shows the all - embracing love of @entity23 , who ministered to all he met : man or woman , slave or free , @entity181 or @entity182			0
' after the @entity101 , @entity5 greeted each of the inmates and gave each one an @entity185			2
' do n't lose hope , ' he said			0
' understand ? with hope you can always go on			0

' we need to go out , then , in order to experience our own anointing ( as priests ) ... to the outskirts where there is suffering , bloodshed , blindness that longs for sight , and prisoners in thrall to many evil masters , ' he said during the @entity192 the 76 - year - old former cardinal @entity5 of @entity46 has inherited a @entity91 rocked by a scandal in which documents leaked to the media spoke of alleged corruption in its administration and depicted prelates as fighting among themselves to advance their careers			2
at the @entity101 , @entity5 said priests should not get bogged down in ' introspection ' but step outside of themselves and concentrate on those who need their help			1
' those who do not go out of themselves , instead of being mediators , gradually become intermediaries , managers			0
