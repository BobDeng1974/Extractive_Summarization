world powers are pushing for the suspension of @entity2 's high - grade uranium enrichment activities over fears the country is trying to develop nuclear weapons , although @entity26 denies the accusation			1
sidelined : @entity2 president @entity1 may have been sidelined by the hard line regime despite the latest offer , it unclear how much influence @entity1 has over the negotiations , and whether his remarks reflect @entity26 's position in the talks			0
