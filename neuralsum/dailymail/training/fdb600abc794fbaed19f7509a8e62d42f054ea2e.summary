if you have ever struggled to untangle the wires on your headphones , an electrical extension cable or a reel of fishing line , then spare a thought for the workers at @entity9 's largest yarn processors who are responsible for keeping 1,500 miles of super-thin thread , tangle and snag - free each week			1
there has been a mill on the banks of the @entity16 at @entity17 on the @entity18 , @entity19 border in @entity17 since the 1200 's			2
today thousands of spools and bobbins ( known as cheeses ) , send the nylon and polyester yarn rushing along a labyrinth of frameworks – known as @entity27 – emerging to form giant webs that fan - out above the mill floor			0
they then feed into machines that use cameras and laser beams to constantly check up to 1000 threads at - a - time before the filaments contained in each thread are bonded in a glue and then dried			0

some of the yarns are so thin they are measured by weight with 10,000 thousand meters of some of today 's threads weighing - in at only a few grams			0
today 's yarns are shipped to weaving companies around the world after being wound and twisted on one of the many machines that fill the other end of the factory floor			0
@entity71 supplies weavers who use the synthetic yarn to make highly technical and demanding fabrics such as automotive products , parachutes , sail cloth , hot air balloons and loading straps			2
