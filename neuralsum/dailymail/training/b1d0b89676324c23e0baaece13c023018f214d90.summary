visitors from outer space or a natural phenomena ? surfers and early morning walkers were stunned to find thousands of ' alien eggs ' on a @entity7 beach this weekend			1
locals in @entity11 , on the city 's @entity8 , reported seeing a large number of the strange objects which had washed ashore overnight			1
but rather than the green spheres being something from another planet , scientists explained they were a type of sponge - like seaweed that forms egg shapes possibly to protect themselves from predators			1
' about three days ago , there were a few egg - shaped balls but then today , they were much bigger and everywhere on the beach , ' @entity39 resident @entity38 told the @entity43			2
@entity44 from nearby @entity45 saw the weird balls on her regular morning beach walk			0
' it was a windy day with a very high tide			0
i picked one up and squeezed it and it was so squishy - but i was n't sure if it was alive and was worried i might hurt anything inside ! ' she told the @entity56			0
' it struck me how perfectly shaped they all were and how green and alive they looked			0
' associate professor @entity60 from the @entity61 , @entity62 and environmental sciences at the @entity64 said the balls were probably a rare type of living green algae , which has only been seen a handful of times around the world			1
the balls are thought to be an extremely rare species of filamentous green algae			2
the living organisms are known in @entity35 as ' @entity75 ' and @entity77 ball or @entity79 ball in @entity80 , and are sometimes found in freshwater lakes in the @entity82			0
‘ @entity88 ’ describes the habit of free living algae ( algae not attached to rocks ) forming into balls			2
floating algae balls are thought to be brought ashore by warmer weather and the rough wave conditions			1
it 's unknown why the algae forms into balls			0
one hypothesis is that a ball - shape helps protect the algae from hungry fish , another that it may help them roll back into the water and avoid drying out when they wash ashore			1
' i ’ve seen similar things - sometimes dead sea grass can roll around and form balls like underwater tumbleweeds but that ’s made of dead material and these look to be living , ' he told the @entity43			1
' it is a habit known as " aegagropilious " , where the algae is free living ( not on rocks ) and forms into spherical balls			0
' the @entity117 and @entity119 ’s @entity118 said the algae balls made their way to the beach with the right biophysical conditions , but that these conditions do n't align every @entity125			2
' it ’s clearly another response to spring sunshine , and just the right wave conditions to tumble them , ' said mr @entity118			0
' @entity131 ' : the sponge like sea balls are thought to be rare living algae , sometimes seen in freshwater lakes in the @entity82 scientists think the algae forms into balls to protect itself from fish and other predators or so that they can roll back into the sea when washed ashore it 's the second unusual natural spectacle to hit @entity7 's beaches in a matter of weeks			1
last month , the waves at @entity147 were lit up a fluorescent blue for three nights by ' agitated ' phytoplankton , apparently signalling the start of @entity125 .			0

beach - goers describe green ' alien hairballs ' washed up on a @entity7 's @entity24
the strange round objects are thought to be a rare type of living algae , brought ashore by warmer weather and rough conditions
scientists think the algae might form into balls to protect itself from hungry fish
