@entity1 is creating a ' great wall of sand ' in the @entity4 , the @entity0 has said			1
the latest huge land mass is 1.5 square miles ( four square kilometres ) in size and was created by dumping sand on live coral reefs , possibly damaging local ecosystems			1
but this is just one of several artificial islands @entity1 has been creating in the region - and the exact purpose of them is unknown			1
@entity1 is creating a ' great wall of sand ' in the @entity4 , the @entity0 has claimed			1
five islands have already been made , with two more in development			0
this image shows the @entity18 on 25 february 2014 , which has seen land added drastically over the last three years			0
a @entity1 vessel is seen at the top the large expanses of sand and concrete - the latest being @entity18 - are being built among the @entity26 in the @entity4			1
@entity1 is creating the area by using dredging vessels to dig up sediment from the sea , and then dumping it on subermeged coral reefs to make islands , @entity34 - a geopolitical researcher in @entity1 - explained			1
and experts have told @entity37 that the activities could be hugely damaging to local ecosystems			1
@entity1 has supposedly been carrying out the land reclamation in order to build airstrips and other structures in the region			0
five islands in total have been built in this way , and two more are in development			2
@entity50 of the @entity51 , said : ' the activities described would appear to clearly both be greatly exceeding corals and coral reefs â€™ ability to cope and survive the excess sediments and turbidity			1
' he said that as the reefs were being covered by cement and landfill , this constituted ' outright destruction ' of the buried coral reefs and associated habitats			1
' coral reefs are extremely globally and locally valuable both for the biodiversity and ecosystem they create but also for the tremendous services they provide in terms of food supply , cultural heritage , erosion prevention , recreation , tourism , and habitat for myriad other organisms , ' he continued			2
' coral reefs worldwide are under extreme threat from changing climate and from local sources of land based pollution , over fishing , and coastal construction			2
' the activities described would appear to represent an additional and severe threat to coral reef ecosystem health and sustainability			0
' @entity92 , a professor of @entity93 at the @entity94 , added : ' it is clearly destroying [ coral reefs ] at the local scale of the land claim and the environment			2
' in the bigger scheme of things it is harder to be precise as these are small areas in a large area of reef			0
' experts have told @entity37 that the activities could be hugely damaging to local ecosystems			1
@entity1 has supposedly been carrying out the land reclamation in order to build airstrips and other structures in the region			0
the extent of how much damage is being done is seen in this image this photo released by the @entity119 @entity118 , shows what the @entity18 looked like on 28 february 2013			0
a @entity1 - made structure stands on the @entity122 , called @entity123 by the @entity119 and @entity124 by @entity1 , in the @entity26 in the @entity4 this photo , taken on 13 march 2012 , shows what the @entity18 looked like before @entity1 started to build there			1
the @entity119 has protested @entity1 's reclamation of land in the disputed reef in the @entity4 that can be used to build an airstrip or an offshore military base in the increasingly volatile region yesterday , the commander of the @entity136 - admiral @entity135 - warned that the constructions were ' increasing regional tensions and the potential for miscalculation			1
' ' @entity1 is building artificial land by pumping sand on to live coral reefs - some of them submerged - and paving over them with concrete			1
@entity1 has now created over 4 square kilometers ( 1.5 square miles ) of artificial landmass , ' he said			1
@entity149 said the region is known for its beautiful natural islands , but ' in sharp contrast , @entity1 is creating a great wall of sand with dredges and bulldozers over the course of months			2
' @entity1 claims virtually all of the @entity4 , but the @entity119 and other countries which have territorial disputes with @entity1 in the busy sea have been particularly concerned by the land reclamation projects			2
these have turned a number of previously submerged reefs in the @entity26 archipelago into artificial islands with buildings , runways and wharves			1
the islands could be used for military and other facilities to bolster @entity1 's territorial claims			2
the dispute centres around hundreds of tiny shoals , reefs and islets in the @entity4 known as the @entity26 and the @entity176			1
several south @entity179 countries stake claim to the territory , though @entity1 tries to control the largest portion of the archipelago			0
@entity183 has claimed its right to the collection of land masses is 2,000 years old which , they say , includes the islands in @entity1 history			2
@entity190 supports its claim , and has its own airfield on the island of @entity194			0
@entity196 officials say their government has ruled over the land since the 17th century whilst the @entity119 , the closest geographically , says the islands belong to them			0
in 1974 , @entity1 forces seized the @entity176 from @entity196 , killing 70 troops			0
there were further clashes between the two countries in 1988 , with 60 @entity196 soldiers killed			0
in 2012 @entity1 and the @entity119 were embroiled in a lengthy maritime standoff over a @entity207			0
the @entity119 military employed its largest warship for the dispute over the stretch of water which they call @entity214			0
upon boarding a @entity1 military vessel for inspection , officials claimed they found live sharks , clams and illegal reef			0
later , @entity196 border agencies refused to stamp passports asserting @entity1 sovereignty over a handful of the islands and in january it was claimed @entity1 would be taken to a @entity227 tribunal to challenge its stake			0
@entity1 is creating the area by using dredging vessels to dig up sediment from the sea , and then dump it on subermeged reefs to make islands , @entity34 - a geopolitical researcher in @entity1 - explained			1
shown is an image of a dredging vessel in @entity238 , demonstrating how land can be moved from underwater @entity149 said the pace of @entity1 's construction of artificial islands ' raises serious questions about @entity1 intentions			1
' he said the @entity247 continues to urge all claimants to conform to the 2002 @entity1 - @entity249 , in which the parties committed to ' exercise self - restraint in the conduct of activities that would complicate or escalate disputes and affect peace and stability			2
' ' how @entity1 proceeds will be a key indicator of whether the region is heading toward confrontation or cooperation , ' he said			0
the @entity247 says it has a national interest in the peaceful resolution of the disputes in a region crucial for world trade			0
@entity1 says its territorial claims have a historical basis and objects to what it considers @entity247 meddling .			0

@entity1 is building artificial islands on coral reefs in the @entity4
five have been built in the @entity26 - with two more in development
the latest island is a huge 1.5 square miles ( four square km ) in size
but experts told @entity37 the activities could be hugely damaging
