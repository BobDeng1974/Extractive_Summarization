@entity1 goalkeeper @entity0 has played second fiddle to @entity10 since the turn of the year @entity5 believes that @entity0 should move on for the sake of his international career with @entity17 ' in excellent form is @entity26 and , on the other hand , @entity27 is very experienced			1
i think [ @entity30 ] @entity29 [ @entity17 manager ] will wait to make the decision until the very end			0
' @entity34 is the least likely to play in the match with @entity36			0
