by @entity0 follow @ @ neilashton _ @entity2 ’s players look like they are dressed for a wet and windy night in @entity3 but there ’s method in the madness as @entity8 ’s charges prepare for the heat and humidity of @entity11			1
the players wore several layers of warm clothing as they trained here in @entity16 while @entity8 ’s sports science team monitored their body temperatures			1
sports scientists from @entity20 have flown out to take samples of the players ’ sweat as they prepare for the humid conditions of @entity25 , where @entity2 play @entity26 on june 14 in their first @entity28 game			1

@entity8 said : ‘ i asked him to present himself to us and he did that in a very entertaining and informative way			2
the players were very attentive			0
sitting behind them watching them listen suggested they were interested			0
‘ he is an entertaining man			0
he just told us all the things he ’s done in life			0
i do n’t know how old he is but to do all the things he ’s done he must be about 150			0
’ master mind : manager @entity8 talks to the players during the training session putting it into practice : @entity8 gave his players a demonstration during the session in @entity16 @entity8 delivered a post-training pep talk to his young players on wednesday , telling them they must take their chance at this @entity106			1
@entity8 pointedly took @entity38 , @entity31 and @entity49 aside for individual conversations lasting several minutes at the end of their hour - long session			1
@entity38 ( 18 ) , @entity31 ( 19 ) and @entity49 ( 20 ) are the youngest members of the squad and he was keen to stress that they are heading to the @entity106 on merit			1
@entity31 was the outstanding player during on wednesday 's open training session , but @entity8 wants to make sure the young @entity2 players are fully prepared.the head coach said : ‘ they should be pleased they are here , but they should n’t feel overawed by the occasion because they have done well and deserve their place			1
‘ it was just to tell them they are here on merit			0
i have n’t detected any nerves at all			0
there was a feeling of relief because they realised this year my choice was n’t easy			0
putting the work in : @entity51 and @entity137 are put through their paces eyes on the prize : @entity51 arrives at training and keeps focused at all times getting his point across : @entity8 talks tactics with @entity48 fully involved : @entity8 takes a hands - on role in @entity149 training ‘ there has been a great feeling of enthusiasm and let ’s get started on this adventure we have all been looking forward to			1

’ @entity8 has thrown a protective cloak around his players after criticism of his selection of @entity169 pair @entity168 and @entity170			1
former @entity169 captain @entity171 was scathing about the pair after @entity8 called them into his 23 - man @entity106 squad			1
@entity171 claimed the pair ‘ have gone backwards ’ at @entity169 and questioned the wisdom of taking them to football ’s biggest tournament			0
@entity8 added : ‘ i work on the simple basis that everyone has an opinion			2
if you are a tv pundit you are required to give your opinion and i do n’t expect everyone ’s to fall in with mine			0
if you say to me , has it been a great year for @entity169 and have @entity170 and @entity168 been stars , then of course they have n’t			2
but as far as i am concerned they are @entity2 players because they have been @entity2 players through my two years and any games in particular that @entity168 has played — he has played more than @entity170 — he has certainly never let me down			1
’ safe hands : goalkeeper @entity191 and @entity192 test each other during training in @entity16 @entity8 also approved of @entity196 ’s decision to speak with @entity197 over his criticism of the @entity63 midfielder ’s development			1

@entity8 added : ‘ i ’m always pleased when players handle those moments in the right way			2
when he had a ( @entity207 ) row with @entity208 that was at the other end of the scale ... but it ’s not going to decide if we have a good @entity106 or not			2
if @entity196 answers criticism well or badly , it ’s what he does on the field that matters			0
