it was always going to take something out of the ordinary to beat @entity3 in this kind of mood and it did — an extraordinary piece of slapstick defending from @entity8 to concede a late penalty			1
like an accident trying to happen or a centre half with his shoelaces tied together , @entity8 misjudged a long punt out of the sky and then turned and handled the ball inside the penalty area as he tried to recover from his initial slip			1
@entity20 stepped up to convert from the spot and @entity22 had to settle for a point			1
‘ i do n’t talk about @entity8 ’s actions , ’ said manager @entity24			1
in football you can always make a mistake			0
we need to accept that			0
but it was disappointing to concede the goal in the last minute			0
i am very disappointed , angry and frustrated			0

referee : @entity89 ( @entity90 ) ratings by @entity92 at @entity39 spurs have won only one of their last seven and although the draw was a fair result they seemed set to defy the negative spiral when @entity60 fired them ahead and @entity3 set about protecting the lead with a series of stunning saves			1
‘ he ’s one of the best , he is complete , he ’s brilliant , ’ said @entity35 boss @entity102 about @entity3 , although the goalkeeper really ought to have been retrieving the ball from his net in the opening seconds after the first mistake of the night by @entity8 , who gave the ball to @entity73 , who touched it to @entity79 , darting in from the left			1
@entity79 nudged a pass towards @entity20 but both he and @entity50 missed it as they wrestled each other to the ground and @entity79 picked it up on the other side but , with only @entity3 to beat , slid his effort wide			2
it was an incredible chance , the first of three for the winger , who gave @entity49 all sorts of problems but could not conjure a finish			0
@entity79 was denied by @entity3 , just before half - time and went close with an acrobatic volley after the interval			0
more opportunities were never far away with @entity8 and @entity50 at the back			2
@entity8 is quick across the turf and @entity50 strong in the air , but they offer so much hope to strikers with their loose marking and casual distribution			2
@entity20 crashed an effort into the woodwork in the first half after @entity50 failed to cut out a cross from the left			2
he required two attempts to get it under control before thumping a right - footer against the frame of the goal , where the post meets the bar			0
the former @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity41 striker left his mark on @entity154 physically as well as psychologically with a stray arm across the face , forcing the @entity22 defender to spend most of the game with cotton - wool plugs in his nostrils			1
@entity20 was booked for the foul			2
having started with such intent , @entity35 were rocked by @entity60 ’s strike midway through the half			1
there was little sign of danger when @entity56 rolled a short pass forward but the visitors switched off			0
@entity20 , @entity170 is shown below , was a constant threat to @entity22 's @entity173 from @entity39 @entity20 , @entity170 is shown below , was a constant threat to @entity22 's @entity173 @entity174 was in attendance at @entity39 for @entity22 's @entity38 clash with @entity35 former @entity41 and @entity152 striker @entity20 battles with @entity22 defender @entity8 for possession of the ball @entity60 fires home from long range to give @entity22 the lead in the 27th minute at @entity39 @entity60 runs away to celebrate his goal that gave @entity22 the lead over @entity35 in their @entity38 encounter @entity60 is congratulated by @entity186 and @entity58 after giving @entity22 the lead @entity60 took a couple of touches , moving right to left across the field , worked the ball on to his left foot and drove a low shot back across goalkeeper @entity68			1
what it lacked in ferocity it made up for with accuracy and crept inside the post			0
there may come a point soon when @entity24 has to promote him to the first team — the team he plays in the @entity204			2
@entity60 has four goals despite having started only four games this season , all in @entity208			0
he has only appeared for 39 minutes in the league , where @entity22 have failed to win in their last four and face @entity24 ’s former club @entity210 on sunday			1
@entity60 may not have the finesse and sophistication of other individuals around him in the @entity22 squad but his work - rate is exceptional and he has a goal knack			1
the goal knocked the @entity218 out of their rhythm			0
the tempo dropped and @entity22 enjoyed more possession with @entity60 looking for a second			1
@entity68 made a good block from a fierce strike on the angle and he was denied again by a fabulous save from the keeper , 20 minutes from time			0
@entity35 ' @entity79 attempts an ambitious , acrobatic volley at goal which flew just wide of the far post @entity22 manager @entity24 and @entity35 boss @entity102 give their teams instructions from the touchline @entity3 denies @entity20 from point - blank range , one of his many crucial saves for @entity22 the pick of @entity3 ’s saves was one from close range to tip over from @entity20 after a long pass from @entity77 , but he was given no chance with the penalty			1
@entity20 slid it into the corner after a stuttering run - up			2
@entity246 is tight , with @entity247 of @entity249 top after beating @entity250 , who are bottom , last night , with @entity22 and @entity35 in between on two points			1
