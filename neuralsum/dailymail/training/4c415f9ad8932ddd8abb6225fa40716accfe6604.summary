the @entity8 and @entity7 have announced a merger to create a £ 3.8billion retail giant that will also specialise in fixing every gadget and home appliance they say the deal is a response to a technical revolution that will allow smartphones to become the remote control for the home , performing a range of tasks such as switching on the central heating and receiving alerts when milk is going off in the fridge			1
consequently , they argue it is only sensible to bring these elements together under one roof			0
the deal has triggered suspicions that the newly merged company will cut costs by closing stores and sacking staff where there are outlets close to each other in town centres			1
however , the group claims the new business , which will be called @entity46 and employs 43,000 people across @entity48 , will end up with around 900 more			1
