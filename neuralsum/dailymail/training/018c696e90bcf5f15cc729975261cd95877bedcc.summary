concern : professor @entity1 has revealed children with minor coughs and colds are being taken straight to @entity6 units by their parents children with minor coughs and colds are being taken straight to accident and emergency units by their parents , a senior government advisor has revealed			1
professor @entity1 , a consultant at @entity12 in south west @entity13 , said most of the children who attend the paediatric @entity6 unit there have not seen their gp first			1
he said : ‘ that has tipped over into a marked increase in admissions of children with minor infections who are discharged the next day			2
’ the professor , who advises the @entity25 on antibiotic use , also said that some families ‘ bounce ’ from hospital to hospital , taking their child to a different @entity6 every few days			1
this is because they expect a cold to clear up quickly , when in fact it can take two to three weeks			0
and , in any case , antibiotics kill bacteria and not the viruses behind colds			2
speaking at a @entity13 conference on the growing threat of resistance to antibiotics , professor @entity1 said more needs to be done to teach parents about when antibiotics are needed			1
he told the meeting at the @entity48 : ‘ ninety five per cent of those attending our children ’s @entity6 have no other relation with any other healthcare provider			1
‘ so they are just pitching up to @entity6 always around seven or eight o’clock because the child has a fever and sticky eyes and a cough			2
one of the things we are very aware of is that there is a lot more educating yet to do			0
’ other experts said that difficulties in seeing a gp – or even speaking to one on the phone – mean that worried parents see @entity6 as the best option			1
@entity68 , president of the @entity69 , said that around a third of the children taken to casualty have coughs and colds or minor injuries such as cuts and sprains that could be treated elsewhere			1

‘ and the vast majority of these cases require nothing more than keeping them warm and giving them fluids and some @entity96			0
’ he said that rather than wait an hour or two for their family doctor to call them back , parents head for the hospital			0
@entity102 , a consultant paediatrician in @entity104 , and a spokesman for the @entity106 ( @entity106 ) , said : ‘ it can be difficult to get a @entity17 appointment at the appropriate time			0
treatment : @entity68 , the president of the @entity69 , said that around a third of the children taken to casualty have coughs and colds or minor injuries that could be treated elsewhere ( file image ) ‘ there is also a wider society reason			1
children have become more precious and people move away from their families			0
you used to have a big family and the granny would say the child would be ok but now people do n’t know what to do any more			0
‘ they might have to wait but @entity6 is the only place where they can get sorted			0
’ @entity129 , a @entity106 member and consultant emergency paediatrician in @entity131 , said that some parents struggle to get past their gp ’s receptionist and so turn to @entity6			2
she said : ‘ we know it can be difficult to get a @entity17 appointment unless you convey the right information , so parents choose a place where the door is open and they can take their child			0
