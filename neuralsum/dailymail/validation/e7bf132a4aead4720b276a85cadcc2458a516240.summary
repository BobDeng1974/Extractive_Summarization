two years after @entity1 had a double mastectomy to prevent the onset of breast cancer , the actress has revealed that she has since had her ovaries removed due to a second health scare			1
the 39 - year - old @entity8 star published a lengthy opinion piece , titled @entity10 : diary of a surgery in the @entity13 on monday explaining her decision			1
her revelation comes as @entity16 was seen comforting his wife at @entity19 and @entity20 's soccer match			1
it 's now clear the couple 's affection came during @entity1 's agonizing wait to establish whether she had cancer - a fear which ultimately prompted her to have surgery			1
with her ovaries and fallopian tubes now gone , the mother - of - six has entered early menopause and will not be able to have any more children , she writes in her candid , deeply personal essay			1
in the op - ed piece , @entity1 explains that the mutation in the @entity58 gene gave her an estimated 87 per cent risk of breast cancer and 50 per cent risk of ovarian cancer			1
the director of @entity63 and the upcoming @entity65 , starring her newlywed husband , lost her mother , grandmother and aunt to cancer			2
according to @entity1 , she had been planning to undergo surgery to remove her ovaries and fallopian tubes for a while now , but a call from her doctor two weeks ago made the procedure more urgent			1
a blood test detected potential anomalies linked to the protein @entity80 , which is used to monitor ovarian cancer , @entity1 's doctor told her , urging the actress to see her surgeon , who also had treated her late mother			1
' i went through what i imagine thousands of other women have felt , ' she writes			0
' i told myself to stay calm , to be strong , and that i had no reason to think i would n't live to see my children grow up and to meet my grandchildren			0
' survivor : in may 2013 , the star of @entity8 had a double mastectomy to prevent breast cancer			0
@entity1 is pictured left at a @entity96 premiere in june of that year , just weeks after the surgery and right in @entity98 in her work for the @entity100 in january runs in the family : @entity1 pictured with her mother @entity102 , who died in january 2007 at the age of 56 after an eight - year battle with ovarian cancer @entity16 was in @entity48 when he got the call from his wife of seven months about her new health scare , prompting him to hop on a plane and return at once to @entity110 to be by her side			1
after undergoing a battery of tests and scans , @entity1 got the good news that she was still cancer - free			1
' to my relief , i still had the option of removing my ovaries and fallopian tubes and i chose to do it , ' she writes			1
cover girl : @entity1 graced the cover of the may 2013 issue of @entity125 , which featured an article about her decision to undergo a double mastectomy last week , @entity130 's leading lady went under the knife , undergoing what is known as a laparoscopic bilateral salpingo - oophorectomy			1
@entity1 revealed that one of her ovaries did have a small tumor on it but it turned out to be benign , and there were no signs of cancer in the tissues			1
she noted that she chose to keep her uterus because there is no history of uterine cancer in her family			0
her mother @entity102 died in january 2007 at the age of 56 after an eight - year battle with ovarian cancer			2
@entity1 has previously spoken of the void in her life that her mother 's death had left - a pain that led her to taking the brave decision to have a double mastectomy , so her children may not have to experience the pain she did			1
the actress 's aunt , @entity160 , then died of breast cancer at the age of 61 less than two weeks after @entity1 revealed she had undergone her mastectomy			1
to counteract the loss of her ovaries , @entity1 turned to hormone replacement therapy and had a device inserted in her womb , but she says in the essay that her child - bearing years are now behind her			1
' regardless of the hormone replacements i 'm taking , i am now in menopause , ' she writes			0
' i will not be able to have any more children , and i expect some physical changes			0
but i feel at ease with whatever will come , not because i am strong but because this is a part of life			0
it is nothing to be feared			0
' when @entity1 underwent a double mastectomy two years ago , doctors have noticed an uptick in patients electing to undergo the preventive surgery - even if they did not need it			1
a sigh of relief : @entity1 said it gives her peace of mind that her children , including ( @entity193 ) @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 and @entity197 , will never have to say , ' @entity198 died of ovarian cancer ' in her op - ed piece monday , the @entity100 envoy made it clear that her decision to have her ovaries removed was not solely based on the @entity58 gene mutation , adding that there are other , non-surgical options out there for women , such as birth control pills , alternative treatments and frequent checks - up			1
but taking into account her family 's history , @entity1 said undergoing the operation was the best option for her			2
' there is more than one way to deal with any health issue , ' she states in the @entity13 piece			1
' the most important thing is to learn about the options and choose what is right for you personally			0
' mrs @entity10 points out that surgery has not eliminated her natural predisposition for cancer , but it has taken at least one type of the deadly disease out of the equation			2
' i know my children will never have to say , ' @entity198 died of ovarian cancer ' , " she writes			2
@entity1 has had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed to prevent the onset of cancer @entity1 has a mutation in the @entity58 gene that gave her an estimated 87 per cent risk of breast cancer and 50 per cent risk of ovarian cancer			1
her mother died from the latter at the age of just 56			0
being a carrier of the @entity58 or @entity249 gene gives a woman a 45 - 90 per cent lifetime risk of cancer			2
these genes also increase breast cancer risk in men			0
as many as 65 per cent of women who carry the @entity58 or 2 genes will get ovarian cancer by the age of 75			0
as a result of this gene mutation , ms @entity1 had her breasts surgically removed in may 2013 and has now had her ovaries removed			1
the procedure , called an oophorectomy , can also reduce the risk of breast cancer in these patients by up to 50 per cent			0
while the surgery has not eliminated her natural predisposition for cancer , it has taken ovarian cancer out of the equation			2
however the operation triggers menopause immediately			0
a woman 's periods will stop after this surgery and her hormones drop quickly			0
she may immediately have strong menopausal symptoms , such as hot flushes and reduced sexual desire			0
to counteract the loss of her ovaries and the symptoms of the menopause , ms @entity1 is now taking hormone replacement therapy ( @entity287 )			1
@entity288 , @entity289 and @entity290 at @entity291 in @entity292 and @entity294 @entity293 , told @entity295 that @entity1 , 39 , would be on two forms of hormone replacement therapy ' at least until her mid- 50s '			2
she said : ' she will have had an @entity297 inserted into her womb			0
this is a small , t - shaped plastic device that releases the progesterone hormone			0
' she will also be given the hormone oestrogen in either patch , gel or tablet form , ' she added			0
' because this treatment is replacing the hormones produced by the ovaries , it staves off problems associated with the menopause			0
' after the menopause , the lack of the hormone oestrogen puts women at increased risk of fragile bones and heart disease			0
the skin also loses its elasticity and women may experience depression and / or reduced sexual desire			0
in the @entity13 piece , she explains she had been planning to undergo the surgery to remove her ovaries and fallopian tubes for some time , but a call from her doctor two weeks ago made the procedure more urgent			1
a blood test detected potential anomalies linked to the protein @entity80 , high levels of which can indicate ovarian cancer			1
she revealed that one of her ovaries did have a small tumour on it but it turned out to be benign , and there were no signs of cancer in the tissues			2
however miss @entity288 cautioned that while @entity1 had opted for the radical surgery , it is not the solution for everyone carrying a brca gene			2
she added : ' there is a fine balance when it comes to removing the ovaries of young people			0
' there are many reasons other than ovarian cancer why levels of the @entity80 protein level may be raised - such as the condition endometriosis or a benign ovarian swelling			2
' simply having a raised @entity80 is not reason enough for young women to have their ovaries removed			2
' this surgery triggers immediate menopause and can result in women developing hot flashes literally overnight			0
' you may reduce the risk of cancer but spark another set of health problems such as an increased risk of heart disease and fragile bones , ' she explained .			0
