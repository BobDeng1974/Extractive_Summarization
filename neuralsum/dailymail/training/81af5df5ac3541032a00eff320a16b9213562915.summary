by @entity0 published : 19:19 est , 17 july 2012 updated : 19:19 est , 17 july 2012 @entity1 died from a heart attack in 2010 three security guards working for @entity4 were yesterday spared the threat of prosecution over the death of @entity8 deportee @entity1			1
lawyers at the @entity10 said there was no evidence that could prove to a jury that the guards used illegal or deadly force			1
mr @entity1 , who was being deported after serving a jail sentence for causing actual bodily harm , died of a cardiac arrest after the guards restrained him while putting him aboard an aircraft at @entity21			1
the death of the father of five in october 2010 provoked a wave of protest and @entity4 was stripped of the @entity27 contract to supervise removals of deportees shortly afterwards			1
yesterday his widow @entity30 said the three guards had escaped the law			0
‘ we are distraught my husband has been taken away from me and my children have lost their father , ’ she said			0
‘ he was crying for help before he was killed			0
we ca n’t understand why the officers and @entity4 are not answerable to the law and we or any other member of the public would be			2
’ the @entity10 considered four possible charges that could have been brought against the three guards over 46 - year - old mr @entity1 ’s cardiorespiratory collapse			1
in all cases lawyers considered there was not enough evidence to prove their guilt to a jury			2
senior crown advocate @entity50 said that in order to secure a conviction for gross negligence manslaughter a prosecution would have to prove that the victim was held bent over with his head either on or below his knees for enough time to show it was the actions of the security guards alone that had caused the death			2
the @entity10 said there was no evidence to prove to a jury that the three @entity4 guards used illegal or deadly force against mr @entity1 mr @entity50 said that there were ‘ conflicting witness accounts of the manner in which mr @entity1 was restrained			1
‘ no witness had an unrestricted or uninterrupted view of what happened , and there is no clear picture of what happened in that key window of time to be able to convince a court that mr @entity1 was held in the “ severely splinted ” position for a sufficient period of time			0
’ he said there had been a breach of duty by the guards , but the way mr @entity1 was held was not severe enough for a prosecution			2
mr @entity50 added : ‘ it is not enough to tell a jury what may have caused a person ’s death ; i have to have sufficient evidence that there is a realistic prospect of proving it to them beyond reasonable doubt , and in these circumstances the evidence did not satisfy that test			0
’ he rejected charges of misconduct in public office or unlawful act manslaughter for similar reasons			0
@entity1 died of a heart attack after guards restrained him as he was put on a plane at @entity21 in 2010 @entity4 was found to have training methods that were flawed and suffered shortcomings , but the company had followed @entity114 - approved training methods and a jury would not consider the flaws amounted to corporate manslaughter			1
instead director of public prosecutions @entity118 has ordered a rebuke to the company , in the form of a letter from mr @entity50 which will ‘ highlight concerns ’			0
mr @entity50 added that he understood the decision was not the one mr @entity1 ’s family hoped for , and he offered to meet them to explain it in person			0
the family ’s solicitor @entity130 said : ‘ the evidence is that mr @entity1 died after crying for help whilst under restraint			1
it is a surprise and shock that the @entity137 has not learned the lessons of earlier decisions and still sees fit to act as judge and jury rather than allowing the normal path of criminal justice to be followed			0

@entity1 died after suffering heart attack in @entity21 in 2010
