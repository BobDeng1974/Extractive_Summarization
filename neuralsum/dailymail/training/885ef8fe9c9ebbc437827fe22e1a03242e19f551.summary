many people under emotional stress are reluctant to head to bed because they do n't know , like @entity3 , ' what dreams may come ? ' now scientists have found that dreaming - which is the @entity7 phase of sleep - is actually essential to help us cope with inner turmoil			1
participants found it far easier to cope with emotional images once they had some sleep researchers from the @entity16 , found our brains process emotional experiences during dreams and this takes the painful edge off difficult memories			1
study author @entity23 , said : ' during @entity7 sleep , memories are being reactivated , put in perspective and connected and integrated , but in a state where stress neurochemicals are beneficially suppressed			1
' the team studied 35 healthy young adults for their study , who were divided into two groups			0
all of them viewed 150 emotional images , twice and 12 hours apart , while an mri scanner measured their brain activity			1
half of the participants viewed the images in the morning and again in the evening , staying awake between the two viewings			0
the remaining half viewed the images in the evening and again the next morning after a full night of sleep			2
those who slept in between image viewings reported a significant decrease in their emotional reaction to the images			0
mri scans showed sleep caused a dramatic reduction in reactivity in the amygdala , a part of the brain that processes emotions			1
this allowed the brain 's ' rational ' prefrontal cortex to regain control of the participants ' emotional reactions			2
in addition , overnight recordings of the participant 's electrical brain activity showed levels of stress neurochemicals reduced during sleep			1
co-author professor @entity68 , said : ' the dream stage of sleep , based on its unique neurochemical composition , provides us with a form of overnight therapy , a soothing balm that removes the sharp edges from the prior day 's emotional experiences			1
' did @entity3 have ptsd ? the @entity79 character , portrayed here by @entity81 , famously fears sleep			0
scientists believe dreams help people to deal with emotional troubles , but could malfunction in those with post-traumatic stress the findings , could explain why people with post-traumatic stress disorder ( @entity77 ) , such as war veterans , suffer reoccurring nightmares			2
the researchers said the therapy element of sleep may malfunction in ptsd sufferers			0
therefore when a flashback is triggered by , say , a car backfiring , they relive the whole experience because the emotion has not been properly stripped away from the memory during sleep			0
while we spend one - third of our lives sleeping , there is no scientific consensus on the function of sleep			0
these latest results , published in the journal @entity110 , offers some of the first insights into the emotional function of @entity7 , which typically takes up 20 per cent of a healthy human 's sleeping hours			1
professor @entity68 said dreaming was vital in softening the emotional strength of experiences			2
' we feel better about them , we feel we can cope , ' he said .			0
