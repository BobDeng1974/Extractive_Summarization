a persistent cough could be a sign of lung cancer a persistent cough , a sore that refuses to heal , unexplained weight loss and changing bladder habits			1
they may seem innocuous , irritating facts of life			0
but a leading charity has warned not to dismiss them and six other key changes in your body , for fear they could be a sign of something more sinister			0
the 10 red flags for cancer are ingrained in the minds of doctors and healthcare workers the world over			1
but @entity22 is urging members of the public to familiarise themselves with the key symptoms - in their bid to help save lives			1
a new study published today revealed one in two people born after 1960 is likely to develop cancer at some point in their lifetime			1
with the risk increasing so quickly , experts fear as many as two - thirds of today 's children will be diagnosed with the disease			2
but in many cases early diagnosis can mean the difference between life and death for cancer patients			0
a survey by researchers on behalf of @entity22 found almost half of those displaying at least one red flag for cancer did not visit their gp , thinking their symptoms ' trivial '			1
but experts at the charity advise if you or a member of your family is suffering at least one of these 10 red flag symptoms , book an appointment with a gp straight away : dr @entity60 , a senior research fellow at @entity61 , said many of the people interviewed as part of their study had red flag symptoms ' but felt these were trivial '			1
other people decided not to go for a check up because they feared a cancer diagnosis , while some adopt a stiff upper lip			2
some people surveyed revealed a lack of trust in the health service , while others put their symptoms down to the signs of ageing			2
researchers in @entity80 and @entity81 examined how people who experience possible cancer symptoms decide whether or not to seek medical help			2
a new survey by @entity22 has found many patients displaying one of the 10 red flag symptoms for cancer refrained from visiting their gp feeling their symptoms were ' trivial '			1
a changed mole can indicate a person has skin cancer , the charity warned ( file picture posed by model ) another study released today revealed one in two people born after 1960 will develop cancer during their life they sent out a health survey , which was completed by more than 1,700 people , aged 50 or older from three @entity50 practices			1
the questionnaire did n't specifically mention cancer , but included a list of 17 symptoms including 10 warning signs of cancer			1
@entity107 : 96 per cent of women survive for at least one year , 87 per cent do so for five years , and 78 per cent for a decade			0
skin cancer : 88 per cent of men survive for five years or more			0
for women the figures are even better , with 92 per cent predicted to survive for at least five years			0
@entity113 : just 8 per cent of men survive for five years or more , compared with 12 per cent of women			0
prostate cancer : some 85 per cent of patients survive for five years or more			0
@entity118 : 59 per cent of men survive for five years or more			0
for women , the figure is 58 per cent			0
more than 900 people ( 53 per cent ) reported at least one of the 10 red flag symptoms during the last three months			1
researchers then interviewed around 50 of them , almost half of whom ( 45 per cent ) had not seen their gp about their symptoms			0
one patient , suffering persistent abdominal pain refrained from having a recommended test			0
she said : ' at times i thought it was bad ... but when it kinds of fades away , you know , it does n't seem worth pursuing really			0
' another respondent , who experienced a persistent change in bladder habits , added : ' you 've just got to get on with it			1
' and if you go to the doctor too much , it 's seen as a sign of weakness or that you are not strong enough to manage things on your own			0
' among the reasons people gave for refusing to seek medical help was an instinct that something was n't right , and an awareness of fear they might have cancer			2
one man , with an unexplained lump in his throat , said : ' but always at the back of your mind you 've always got the fear of cancer , well it 's best to check just in case			1
' but fear was also a driving force to stop people getting checked by their gp			0
a persistent change in bladder habits can indicate a person is suffering bladder cancer , pictured under the microscope			1
in men , the symptom can also be a sign of prostate cancer and for some people , persistent symptoms led them to think the signs were normal for them			1
some waited for another reason to visit their gp , then mentioned their red flag symptom			1
and others said they would rather use an emergency route , going straight to @entity193 for example , rather than wait for a referral to see a specialist from their gp			0
dr @entity60 said : ' many of the people we interviewed had red flag symptoms but felt that these were trivial and did n't need medical attention , particularly if they were painless or intermittent			1
' others felt that they should n't make a fuss or waste valuable @entity206 resources			0
' the stiff - upper - lip stoicism of some who decided not to go to their doctor was alarming because they put up with often debilitating symptoms			0
' some people made the decision to get symptoms checked out after seeing a cancer awareness campaign or being encouraged to do so by family or friends – this seemed to almost legitimise their symptoms as important			2
' dr @entity220 , @entity22 's gp expert , said : ' the advice we give is : if in doubt , check it out – this would not be wasting your gp 's time			2
@entity22 is urging anyone suffering any of the 10 red flag symptoms of cancer to visit their gp immediately			1
a long - term cough or hoarseness can be a sign of lung cancer , pictured on an x-ray ' often your symptoms wo n't be caused by cancer , but if they are , the quicker the diagnosis , the better the outcome			1
' seeking prompt advice from your gp about symptoms , either on the phone or during an appointment , could be a life - saver , whatever your age			2
' and the good news is that more than half of all patients diagnosed with cancer now survive for more than 10 years			0
' @entity251 , director of early diagnosis at @entity22 , added : ' spotting and treating cancer early means patients have a far better chance of beating the disease – so it 's important we understand why some people with potential symptoms decide not to get them checked out straightaway			1
' international comparisons have already shown us that the @entity264 public are far more worried about being a burden on the health system or ' wasting the doctor 's time ' than in other developed countries			0
' this study gives us valuable insight into the decision - making process and could help us find ways to encourage everyone with worrying symptoms to seek help as early as possible			2

a long - term cough , a sore that wo n't heal , a changing mole , unexplained weight loss and changing bowel habits are signs of cancer
*difficulty* *swallowing* , an unexplained lump , long - term pain , unexplained *bleeding* and changing bladder habits are also red flag symptoms
a @entity22 study found many people suffering the 10 red flag signs of the disease did n't visit the gp because they thought it was ' trivial '
experts advise anyone displaying one or more red flags to visit their gp
