a fuming general speaking for @entity6 warned @entity10 : " we reserve the right to retaliate			1
we can not be passive when provoked			0
" top government sources said limited , localised military conflict with @entity10 was not ruled out			1
the @entity33 has been put on high alert and @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 sectors may see army retaliation			0
on a day when gen @entity0 talked tough , prime minister @entity40 spoke to @entity42 leaders @entity43 and @entity44 and assured them that the opposition would be kept in the loop over the situation			1
he told them that national security adviser @entity49 would brief them tomorrow ( tuesday ) on the developments			1
in sync with the official line of action , an incensed general fumed : " i expect all my commanders on the @entity17 to be both aggressive and offensive in the face of provocation and fire			1
i do n't expect my commanders to be timid			2
" the chilling warning was delivered by a combative army chief who termed the beheading of @entity9 of 13 @entity65 an " unpardonable " act completely against the ethics of soldiering			1
but he was not willing to raise the level of response at this moment as the @entity55 asserted that @entity6 's payback will be localised and tactical			1
" @entity0 has given a good message			1
he has spoken openly to nail @entity10 's propaganda			1
the statement was given after four - five days of the incident which means that all investigations have been completed and discussions have taken place			0
today 's response is not only of the military but also has a political aspect , " said former army chief general @entity81			1
another former army chief , general @entity85 , said : " definitely there is no gap between the government and the army			0
@entity90 now should take note of the feeling in the army			0
" justifying general @entity0 's stand , lt general ( retired ) @entity94 said : " what army chief has said is the position of government of @entity6			1
he is part of the government			0
it is a stand taken after going through the developments of the last four to five days			0
it is a good reaction from @entity6			1
" @entity33 officers ( left ) and @entity6 @entity33 officers during the flag meeting along the @entity17 at @entity107 in @entity36 on monday just as the @entity55 went public in a manner unusual for an @entity6 army chief , @entity10 was conveyed the sentiments on the grounds in equally uncertain terms during the flag meeting of brigade commanders held at @entity107 in the @entity36 sector			1
@entity55 's outburst was reflected in the flag meeting as @entity10 was bluntly warned to be prepared for retaliation			1
the @entity6 side was represented in the flag meeting by brigadier @entity121 of the @entity122			1
the @entity10 side remained in denial mode			1
they claimed that they had not intruded into @entity6 territory on the day the two jawans were killed			1
when warned by the @entity6 side of escalation , the @entity10 side maintained complete silence on the issue			1
it is clear that the @entity10 army establishment is being blas√© about this operation , but the @entity136 will no longer tolerate any misdemeanor or misconduct on the @entity17 @entity6 also asked for the severed head of @entity9 , even though @entity10 denied involvement in the killing			1
general @entity0 was not willing to accept the denial			1
he slammed the @entity10 army for its blatant lie and claimed that the operation in the @entity147 sector was pre-meditated and executed with planning and after reconnaisance			2
he denied any provocation from @entity6 as claimed by @entity10 army			1
@entity55 said there was no operation by @entity136 on january 6 in @entity38 as alleged by @entity10			2
the @entity10 army was looking to justify the act on the basis of lies , said @entity157			2
" such operations require time and planning and detailed reconnaissance			0
they blamed us in @entity38 and their troops were poised for operation in @entity147 , " he said			0
he even claimed that the @entity6 army has reports about three @entity10 casualties in the firing that has been going on after the @entity147 incident			1
the army chief 's stern warning was in sharp contrast to the soft line taken by the government which was under attack for not nailing @entity10			1
the army chief was officially given the signal to go all - out to convey @entity6 's anguish			1
general @entity0 said clear direction has been given to the northern army commander to retaliate			1
" at military level there is clear direction to northern army commander			0
we got to retaliate in a measured manner and for effect			0
we shall not be passive			0
we reserve the right to retaliate at the time of choosing			0
i expect commanders to be aggressive and assure that army hierarchy is standing behind them , " said the army chief			2
while looking to retaliate , @entity6 made it clear that it is not willing to up the ante and will reserve its response to the tactical level			2
" their operation was at tactical level			0
it has to be dealt with at tactical level , " said @entity206 , stressing the local commanders will plan when , where and how they have to retaliate			2
he indicated that @entity15 - based @entity14 , which commands the vulnerable section of the @entity17 where the most violations of ceasefire have taken place , will execute the hit - back plan			1
northern army commander lt gen @entity217 for northern army commander lt gen @entity218 , retaliation for the january 8 incident , where two soldiers of his command were killed and decapitated , has a more personal meaning			0
@entity9 and @entity225 belonged to the 13 battalion of the @entity65			2
lt gen @entity217 is the colonel of the @entity65 regiment			0
this is significant because regimental affiliations in the army are thicker than blood ties			0
lt gen @entity217 visited the incident site on january 9 and confirmed the bodies had been mutilated			0
the @entity235 , described by army officers as spirited and articulate , was seething			0
it is not known what he told soldiers of his regiment , but army officers say he could not have spoken words of restraint			0
the gruesome killing and the massive publicity it received have embarrassed the regiment			0
" it becomes extremely difficult to control troops in such situations , especially when they are along the @entity17 , " an army officer said			2
the colonel of the regiment is the only post in the @entity136 for which elections are held			0
a collegium of officers above the rank of colonel selects him from the regiment 's senior-most officers			0
the @entity65 , as it is called , is the army 's oldest rifle regiment			0
it has a 400 - year - old history , tracing its origins to the @entity265 raised by the @entity266 in january 1775			0
by @entity267 and @entity268 in @entity269 after days of being at the receiving end of the @entity42 's barbs for his ' silence ' against @entity10 , prime minister @entity40 reached out to the largest opposition party on monday			1
@entity0 spoke to @entity44 and @entity43 , the leaders of the @entity276 in the two houses of @entity278 , briefing them on the situation in the @entity17 ( @entity17 )			1
briefing : the @entity281 confirmed that @entity44 will be briefed on the government 's action plan sources in the @entity281 ( @entity281 ) said national security adviser @entity49 will be briefing senior leaders of the @entity42 on tuesday on the government 's plan of action in response to the brutal murder of two @entity6 troops by @entity10 forces on january 8			1
sources said @entity0 told the leaders that nothing is being done which could not be communicated to the @entity276 leaders			1
he said the opposition would be kept in the loop over the situation			0
" the prime minister 's conversation with the two leaders was aimed at apprising them of the steps that are being taken			2
there is a perception in the @entity276 that the government has not done enough			0
they believe the government is keeping things outside the public domain			0
this is not the case			0
this is an issue of national security and the government is taking steps , " a senior @entity281 official said			1
the prime minister is also said to have tried to impress upon the @entity42 to stop politicising the issue by making provocative statements			0
while paying homage to one of the martyred soldiers , @entity9 , @entity321 exhorted the government to bring 10 heads from @entity10 if @entity9 's severed head was n't returned			1
" the @entity329 had fully supported prime minister @entity330 and defence minister @entity331 during the @entity333 conflict ; the @entity42 must reciprocate by showing the same degree of bipartisanship in the present situation , " a @entity329 leader said			0
the late evening conversation between the @entity330 and the two leaders , however , has set tongues wagging that the government might be considering a major step vis - √† - vis @entity342 in the days to come			2
the government 's need to take decisive steps has been further necessitated by the aggressive posturing of the @entity329 over the past few days			2
party spokesperson @entity347 , who has been particularly vociferous in the entire episode , said : " @entity6 never was , is n't and will never be a soft state			2
" @entity6 would not like to see a war anywhere in the world but will not tolerate any humiliation to its soldiers ... no eventuality can cow us down			2
" the beheading of @entity9 of 13 @entity65 and mutilation of @entity225 's body by @entity33 regulars on the @entity17 in the @entity147 sector was not a one - off incident			1
the @entity136 has accepted that two incidents have taken place earlier - one in may 2000 and the other in july 2011			0
the incidents were hushed up even though they were talked about in the media			0
while it showed that the @entity33 had broken the rules of engagement of civilised forces in the past as well , @entity6 had chosen to sweep them under the carpet , fearing the impact on the morale of the forces			2
in 2000 , a raid led by terrorist @entity376 at @entity377 killed seven @entity6 soldiers			2
one of them , @entity380 , was beheaded			0
in july 2011 , the @entity33 beheaded two @entity6 soldiers of 20 @entity382			2
the incident was denied by the @entity136 but the local police confirmed at the time of cremation that the jawans ' heads were missing .			0
