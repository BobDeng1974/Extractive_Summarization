the @entity0 is fast approaching and the tournament promises to be an epic , glorious spectacle			1
overall , the game is growing and is in good health , but here are five @entity6 wishes for rugby — based on fundamental domestic and global issues ... on the home front , the @entity9 has just enjoyed a glittering festive weekend which showcased its tribal appeal			1
there were full houses all around — including a crowd of 82,000 at @entity15 for @entity17 v @entity16 , which was the biggest sporting attendance in the country			1
television ratings are up , many matches are producing thrilling and explosive action founded on a large core of @entity25 talent , and the scourge of crushingly predictable results which afflicts many leagues has been largely avoided			1
@entity45 lost 24 - 9 at @entity46 , which was in fact a heroic triumph when taken in the context of their miserable season			2
the @entity53 - based exiles are doomed to a prompt return to the @entity55 , having already conceded 514 points in just 11 matches in the top division			2
that they are sadly out of their depth is abundantly clear and it paints the competition in a bad light , as the gulf need n’t be so stark			2
@entity17 and @entity16 played out a thrilling contest infront of 82,000 fans at @entity15 last saturday @entity45 receive just £ 1.5million in central funding , compared to the £ 4m which is handed out to their league rivals			1
this imbalance , which creates a horribly uneven playing field , is based on a convoluted shares system and has led to accusations from one mp that @entity9 is operating a ‘ cartel ’ , at the expense of promoted clubs			2
either @entity80 or @entity81 will come up from the @entity55 at the end of this season and they are both handsomely funded , so the imbalance wo n’t have such a profound impact , but it should be addressed and changed nonetheless			2
the shares scheme is a throw - back to a newly - professional club game finding its feet , but @entity90 and its members have increasing tv revenue and gate receipts , so the funding should be universal , to remove this basic lack of sporting fairness			2
there has been a renewed debate about the merit of the salary cap in recent weeks , but instead of attempting to polarise the @entity9 , the priority should be to support the weakest			2
referee @entity102 looks at replays on a screen officiating in rugby is in a mess — crippled by no - discretion edicts and uncertainty about how best to harness technology			1
this column does not possess the answers , but it can certainly highlight the pressing problems			2
there needs to be absolute , global clarity about the use of @entity116 and some common sense applied to the witch - hunt against ‘ dangerous ’ tackles , some of which are nothing of the sort			0
referees must resume policing scrum feeds and forward passes ( to hell with the nonsense about ‘ momentum ’ , it ’s either forward or it ’s not ) , and further crack down on time - wasting at the base of rucks			0
and the creeping menace of players diving or demanding that opponents are shown cards must be emphatically , swiftly eradicated			0
@entity137 has not played since suffering a head injury playing for @entity139 against @entity140 in november fixture congestion is arguably the biggest threat to the sport , as it has such a wide - ranging impact			1
player welfare is in danger as never before due to the excessive demands placed on those at the elite level , especially in @entity150			0
measures to improve concussion awareness and treatment are to be applauded , but the toll of serious injuries keeps rising			0
bodies are breaking under the strain			0
clubs and countries want their pound of flesh , but the regular absence of star players reduces the quality of the game			0
too many tests are being played to prop up unions ’ finances and as well as causing injuries , it dilutes interest			1
this column continues to advocate a global season based on summer rugby in the northern hemisphere			0
one day , maybe ... @entity15 will be among the 13 stadiums which will play host to the @entity178 the thorny issue of made - for - tv kick - off times may well come to a head during the @entity0 , due to the alarming prospect of night matches at @entity15 and the @entity185			1
@entity187 ’s opener against @entity188 could bring transport chaos as it clashes with the weekly horror of the friday evening rush - hour			1
in @entity194 , @entity195 and elsewhere , roads and trains will struggle with the task of ferrying fans home from venues			1
next month , @entity200 host @entity187 on a friday night , which means another motorway marathon for those crossing the @entity203 from the east			1
at club level , the new @entity205 features games on sunday evenings			0
broadcasters have their wall - to - wall coverage , but the wishes of spectators , especially those travelling from afar , are compromised			0
sadly , the trend wo n’t be reversed until screens are filled with empty stands			0
@entity187 , celebrating the 2003 @entity0 triumph , are the only @entity217 side to win the title the scoreline stands at 6 - 1 to the @entity220 when it comes to @entity0 titles			1
@entity223 , @entity140 and @entity224 have each won the event twice , with only @entity187 in 2003 breaking this @entity227 grip on the @entity228			1
here ’s hoping for a @entity217 uprising in 2015			0
@entity139 turned the tables on the raiders from the far side of the equator during the autumn , @entity29 ’s @entity187 are capable of lowering the colours of any visitor at home and @entity200 may believe anything is possible now by beating the @entity224			1
@entity239 can conquer any team if the mood takes them , and even @entity242 are equipped to dish out the odd bloody nose			0
the annual circus of hearing @entity246 players in particular reveal a total lack of awareness about the game in these parts is depressing and infuriating			0
only beating them makes them take notice and show due respect			0
that would be a welcome development .			0

the home @entity0 will launch at @entity15 in *mid* *september*
@entity223 are favourites to win the tournament in @entity187
finances , fixture congestion and officiating are still big issues
