by @entity0 for the @entity1 when @entity2 talks about the @entity4 job , he speaks with authority			1
he wants a successful national team			0
to think that he could soon be taking the sessions as @entity4 ’s head coach is a tantalising , exciting prospect			2
he is the first from the @entity11 — the term given to @entity4 ’s players by the @entity14 a decade ago — to say he wants the biggest job of the lot			1
we have tried everything else and everything else has failed			0
@entity2 has already started his coaching badges			1
when he gets his @entity30 , he could be further down the route of landing the biggest job in @entity34 football			0
in many ways international football could be a young man ’s game , with @entity2 commanding the respect of the dressing room after a glittering playing career			1
@entity4 ’s players will be aware of his achievements in the game , fully aware that @entity2 was one of the finest central defenders of his generation			1
he has worked with some big names in club football — @entity49 , @entity50 , sir @entity51 and @entity52 — and learned from all of them			0
fitting right in : ferdinand with @entity55 and sir @entity56 on the bench in @entity58 at international level he was inspired by @entity60 and @entity61 , people he respects and admires			0
he has made mistakes , but he will be right to question those in power if he does n’t get an opportunity to manage when his playing career ends			0
it feels right that @entity2 should be part of the future of @entity34 football and he should be encouraged by the @entity14 to fulfil his dream			2
if it becomes a reality , @entity4 really could be on to something .			2

@entity2 has set his sights on @entity4 job after *completing* his coaching badges
the *35* **-** year **-** old defender has experienced almost everything after a *lifetime* in the game
@entity85 could command the respect of the @entity4 dressing room
