by @entity0 , @entity1 on sunday political editor published : 18:47 est , 9 march 2013 updated : 18:53 est , 9 march 2013 @entity3 has pledged to scrap the @entity4 if the @entity5 win the next election defiant @entity3 yesterday stepped up her campaign to become @entity5 leader by confirming her plan for the @entity11 to break free of the shackles of @entity14 judges			1
she also suggested smashing the ‘ state monopoly ’ of schools and hospitals by letting them make a profit – and demanded a new crackdown on unions			1
@entity22 accused the home secretary of revealing a ‘ secret right - wing agenda ’ to privatise education and the @entity25 , and to attack unions			1
and they said quitting the @entity29 ( @entity29 ) would backfire			2
in a speech at @entity32 dubbed her personal ‘ leadership may - nifesto ’ , mrs may said if the @entity5 were to regain popularity , they had to produce ‘ radical ’ new policies			1
her comments reinforce claims by her allies who say she is on course to follow in the footsteps of @entity11 ’s first female prime minister , @entity44			1
mrs may ’s proposal that the @entity11 must consider quitting the @entity29 was first revealed by this newspaper last week			1
throughout the week , she refused to comment on the matter , as a feud erupted between her @entity5 supporters and opponents			1
it also fuelled claims that she is secretly preparing a leadership challenge if @entity54 loses the next general election , due in 2015			1
an increasingly confident mrs may broke her silence at a @entity5 rally yesterday			1
it was time to stop criminals getting off scot - free because of human rights laws , she said , declaring : ‘ all options – including leaving the @entity29 altogether – should be on the table			1
’ adopting the mantle of ‘ the new @entity64 ’ , mrs may said it was time to consider boosting standards in education and health by letting schools and hospitals make a profit			1
aides denied it amounted to privatisation , pointing out schools and hospitals would continue to be ‘ free at the point of use ’			2
mrs may said the case of hate preacher @entity79 , who was denied bail at his latest hearing today , highlighted the need for @entity11 to change its human rights laws on quitting the @entity85 - based @entity29 , mrs may said : ‘ we need to stop human rights legislation interfering with our ability to fight crime and control immigration			1
‘ that ’s why the next @entity5 government will scrap the @entity4			1
’ to cheers from @entity5 activists , she continued : ‘ we should also consider very carefully our relationship with the @entity29 and the convention it enforces			1
‘ when @entity85 constantly moves the goalposts and prevents the deportation of dangerous men like @entity79 , we have to ask ourselves , to what end are we signatories to the @entity29 ? are we really limiting human rights abuses in other countries ? i ’m sceptical			2
’ it undermined @entity11 ’s national interest and its own @entity106 , the home secretary maintained			1
‘ by 2015 we ’ll need a plan for dealing with the @entity108			2
and yes , i want to be clear that all options – including leaving the convention altogether – should be on the table			2
’ similar drastic measures to improve public services should be studied , she said			2
the @entity114 had already given parents and patients more choice but had not gone far enough , mrs may insisted			2
@entity5 mp @entity118 said that @entity3 's speech ' went down very well ' ‘ i expect our reform agenda to become even more radical			1
yes , the state should make sure that public services are available to all and free at the point of use			0
‘ yes , the @entity121 should regulate those services to make sure they ’re provided everywhere and offer high standards			0
‘ but too often the state is a poor provider of services , and its monopoly over the delivery of those services must end			0
a future @entity5 government should increase the number of charities , companies and co-operatives that deliver frontline services			1
‘ if allowing them to make a profit means we have a more diverse supply side and better outcomes , then we should consider it with an open mind			0
’ mrs may dismissed claims that people ‘ do n’t want choice , they just want better services ’			0
she said : ‘ why should choice be the preserve of the rich , who can afford to go private ? ‘ why is it assumed that wealthy parents and patients are capable of making choices , while nobody else is ? ‘ it will be left to the @entity5 to break the state monopoly , to open up public services , and give everybody – not just the rich – the freedom to choose what is right for themselves and their families			1
’ mrs may also called for new curbs on unions			0
she said : ‘ it ’s not just freedom from the state we need to think about			0
we need to think about freedom from vested interests			0
that means taking on trade unions resistant to change			0
’ last night @entity5 mp @entity118 said : ‘ there is no vacancy at the moment but clearly in the future , the home secretary will be a very credible candidate			1
‘ she has run her department very well and it ’s extraordinarily difficult to be home secretary			1
she has handled it very well			0
she has widespread support in the party			0
‘ her views on human rights rules and reports that she wants to pull out of the @entity29 went down very well with party members			2
’ by @entity186 , @entity187 editor a pensions row has broken out between top judges , including lord judge , the lord chief justice , and the government the wealthiest judges in the country are using human rights laws to challenge the government over cuts to their gold - plated pensions worth hundreds of millions of pounds			2
a secret dossier leaked to @entity200 reveals how lord judge , the lord chief justice and @entity11 ’s most senior judge , is spearheading an unprecedented attack on the government ’s authority over public finances			1
judges have instructed top barristers to advise them on using human rights laws to sue ministers who have reduced pensions in line with those paid to senior civil servants			2
in the past , judges have not contributed to a pension that pays them half their former salary plus a lump sum pay - off			0
the changes will result in them contributing for the first time and paying tax on the income the pensions provide			0
the 100 - page dossier exposes the ferocity of the dispute between the government and the judiciary which could spark a constitutional crisis			0
in one draft of a letter intended for the lord chancellor , @entity232 , the judges use the threat of court action to try to get their way			0
‘ it would be in nobody ’s interest for these issues to be resolved by litigation			0
however , you will understand that the possibility of recourse to the courts can not be ruled out			0
’ judges earn up to up £ 240,000 a year			0
lord judge ’s annual pension will be £ 119,922 and he will get a lump sum payment of more than £ 250,000 when he retires later this @entity251 mp @entity250 questioned how the case could be properly heard in court			0
he said : ‘ natural justice requires people do not sit in judgment in their own case			0
it is difficult to see how an application by the judiciary to quash changes to their own pension payments can be handled without a conflict of interest			0
’ neither the senior judiciary nor the government would comment on the matter .			0
