by @entity0 published : 14:11 est , 16 july 2013 updated : 05:38 est , 24 october 2013 a gloomy @entity3 town will receive its first ever rays of winter sunshine this year after locals set up giant mirrors to bounce light down from the mountainside			1
the industrial town of @entity12 is nestled deep in a valley floor in the rugged @entity15 county and with the sun moving low across the sky during winter , it gets no direct sunlight between the months of september and march			1
for years the sun - starved locals have had to take a purpose - built cable car to the top of the mountain side in order to catch a few winter rays			1
known as heliostats , they have been designed to track the movement of the sun and reflect the light down directly onto @entity12 's main square			2
the idea is not new			0
it was first suggested in @entity12 100 years ago by a worker at the nearby hydroelectric plant			1
in the shade : @entity12 is nestled in a valley floor in rugged @entity15 county and as the sun moves low across the sky in winter , it gets no direct sunlight between the months of september and march the plant 's founder , celebrated @entity3 engineer and industrialist @entity63 was concerned his workers were n't getting enough sunshine during the winter months			2
he considered the mirror idea but felt they lacked the technology to make it work so opted instead for the construction of a cable car			2
@entity12 is situated in @entity3 's rugged @entity15 county in 2006 , a similar project was successfully set up in the village of @entity75 in northern @entity76 which had suffered from exactly the same problem			1
a delegation from visited @entity75 to see how their mirror had transformed people 's lives , and was suitably impressed			0
after five years of debate , @entity12 town council finally agreed to invest the necessary 5 million @entity3 kroner ( £ 544,000 ) to build the mirrors			0
they are controlled by computer to follow the path of then sun , adjusting to the best angle to ensure the town square is bathed in light			2
solar panels will power equipment to automatically wash the mirrors and move them into position			0
designers hope the sunshine will revitalise the town during the winter months			0
a message on the @entity12 tourist website states : ' the square will become a sunny meeting place in a town otherwise in shadow			0
' according to project coordinator , @entity107 , the construction work is almost complete but it wo n't be until september , when the sun disappears , that the system can be properly tested			0
a similar scheme has been successfully implemented in the @entity76 village of @entity75 where an eight - by - five metre mirror reflects sunlight onto the main square			1

industrial town of @entity12 gets no sunshine between september and march
three giant mirrors or ' heliostats ' have been set up on the mountainside
they will track the path of the sun and beam light onto the town square
idea was first suggested 100 years ago but a cable car was built instead
a similar scheme has been successfully implemented in an @entity76 village
