by @entity0 ‘ unscrupulous ’ bosses who force workers into signing contracts which offer no guaranteed hours every week will today be warned they must clean up their act			2
many of @entity7 ’s biggest employers , such as @entity8 ’s , the fast food chain , and the @entity10 , use these so - called ‘ zero hour contracts ’			1
a ‘ zero hours ’ contract means you have a contract with a company , but there is no guarantee you will be offered any work , which leads to financial insecurity and disruption to family life			1
under the crackdown , which will be announced today , @entity22 will reveal a ban on the use of ‘ exclusivity clauses ’ in these types of contracts			1
the clampdown by the business secretary comes after @entity42 said it would outlaw any zero hours contract which exploited a worker			0
while ruling out a blanket ban , @entity42 promised dramatic changes , such as making bosses move a worker onto a proper contract after one year if they have been working regular hours and compensation if a worker had their hours cancelled at short notice			0
mr @entity22 said zero hours contracts have ‘ a place in today ’s labour market ’ , such as offering flexible work for students , older people and workers wanting to top up their main income			1
but he added : ‘ it has become clear that some unscrupulous employers abuse the flexibility that these contracts offer to the detriment of their workers			0
‘ we are legislating to clamp down on abuses to ensure people get a fair deal			0
’ a government consultation into zero hours contracts found ‘ overwhelming evidence ’ that controversial ‘ exclusivity ’ clauses should be banned			1
the consultation , which received 36,000 responses , found more than eight in ten people were in favour of banning exclusivity clauses in zero hours contracts			1
mr @entity22 said zero hours contracts still have ' a place in today 's labour market ' @entity84 , director general of the @entity85 , the business lobby group , said : ‘ it is right to ensure that exploitation is stamped out			1
‘ tying an employee into an exclusivity clause can turn a flexible contract into a rigid and archaic one			0
’ the @entity91 said it will also consult further on how to prevent ‘ rogue ’ bosses evading the ban , such as offering a one - hour fixed contract to their workers			2
the @entity96 recently estimated around 1.4million so - called ‘ zero hours ’ contracts exist in @entity7 , and it predicts the number could be even higher			2
around one in eight businesses in the @entity7 use zero hours contracts , but large firms employing 250 or more people are far more likely to use them than smaller employers			2
the majority of workers with a zero hours contract are women , who typically work for the @entity10 , cafes , restaurants and hotels doing poorly paid jobs			0
for many workers with these types of contracts , it also means the boss does not offer paid holidays , maternity pay or other traditional benefits enjoyed by a permanent employee			0
@entity121 , the shadow business secretary , accused the government of presiding over ‘ a rising tide of insecurity			0
’ he said : ‘ zero - hours contracts , which were once a niche and marginal concept , have become the norm in parts of our economy as families have been hit by the cost of living crisis			1
’ today ’s ban will be part of the @entity137 which will be introduced to @entity138 today .			0

contracts mean that here is no guarantee you will be offered work , even if you are employed by a company
this leads to financial insecurity and disruption to family life
many of @entity7 's biggest employers , such as @entity8 ’s and @entity10 use them
@entity22 will reveal a ban on the use of ‘ exclusivity clauses ’
but said zero - hours contracts still had ' a place in today 's labour market '
