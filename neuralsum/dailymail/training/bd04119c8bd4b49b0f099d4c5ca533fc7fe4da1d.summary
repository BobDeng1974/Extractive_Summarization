the most distant galaxy ever seen in the universe has been discovered by astronomers			2
it ’s so far away that its light , initially captured by @entity5 , has taken 13.1 billion years to reach @entity6			1
it 's remote distance means that scientists are observing it at a time when the universe was in its infancy			2
pictured is an artist 's rendition of the newly discovered most distant galaxy named z8 - @entity18 - 5296 , whose light began its journey to @entity6 just 700 million years after the birth of the universe the galaxy is thought to be 30 billion light years from @entity6 but we can only see it as it was 13.1 billion years ago because of the way the universe is expanding			1
a new spectroscope - an optical device for producing and observing a spectrum of light or radiation - on the @entity34 space telescope in @entity35 confirmed its distance by measuring its ‘ redshift ’ or wavelength			0
although some more distant candidate galaxies have been detected their existence has not yet been fully established in this decisive way			0
the galaxy has a redshift of 7.51 meaning it was born only 700 million years after the @entity47			1
few galaxies with redshifts greater than seven have had their distances confirmed spectroscopically			2
a new spectroscope - an optical device for producing and observing a spectrum of light or radiation - on the @entity34 space telescope ( pictured ) in @entity35 confirmed its distance its red , ultraviolet light colour implies it ’s rich in metal and churns out stars over a hundred times quicker than the @entity61			1
professor @entity62 , of @entity63 in @entity64 , said : ‘ what makes this galaxy unique - compared to other such discoveries - is the spectroscopic confirmation of its distance			0
’ light travels at about 186,000 miles per second so when we look at distant objects we see them as they appeared in the past			0
the more distant we push these observations the farther into the past we can see			0
professor @entity62 said : ‘ by observing a galaxy that far back in time we can study the earliest formation of galaxies			1
‘ by comparing properties of galaxies at different distances we can explore the evolution of galaxies throughout the age of the universe			2
’ the detection of ever more remote galaxies are on the horizon with the construction of the powerful @entity90 in @entity35 and the @entity91 in @entity92 ( pictured ) along with the 6.5 metre @entity93 the researchers ’ observations , described in @entity96 , show the galaxy named z8 - @entity98 is forming about 330 stars each year			1
by comparison the @entity61 forms only two to three stars per year			1
the new distance record - holder lies in the same part of the sky as the previous record - holder at a redshift of 7 - which also happens to have a very high rate of star - formation			0
project leader dr @entity109 , of @entity110 in @entity111 , said : ‘ there are way more regions of very high star formation than we previously thought			0
‘ there must be a decent number of them if we happen to find two in the same area of the sky			0
’ professor @entity62 said the detection of ever more remote galaxies are on the horizon with the construction of the powerful @entity90 in @entity35 and the @entity91 in @entity92 along with the 6.5 metre @entity93 in space			0
he said : ‘ by the end of this decade we should expect to find many more such galaxies at even larger distances allowing us to witness the process of galaxy formation as it happens			1

this compares to two or three stars that the @entity61 produces annually
@entity134 's light began journey to @entity6 700 million years after the @entity47
by 2020 , we are expected to find more such galaxies at larger distances
this will allow us to witness the process of galaxy formation as it happens
