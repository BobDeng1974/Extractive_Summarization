by @entity0 schools , hospitals and prisons should buy @entity7 food even if it is more expensive , new @entity2 guidelines will say			1
current rules which make price the overriding factor in public sector purchasing will be scrapped this summer			0
they will be replaced by new guidance designed to boost @entity7 agriculture and improve quality , under which public bodies will be obliged to prioritise other factors , including local sourcing			1
hospitals and schools will be encouraged to buy @entity7 food rather than simply going to the cheapest source the public sector currently spends £ 2.1billion a year on food , and the government is keen to reduce foreign imports and boost farming			1
@entity7 imports 40 per cent of its food - including many products which could be produced domestically			1
farming minister @entity29 told the @entity30 : ‘ the government spends more than £ 2billion on food and we ’re keen to improve procurement so that @entity7 agriculture gets a proper shot at that business			1
‘ @entity37 is clearly an important factor that needs to be taken into account , but it wo n’t be the overriding factor			0
‘ if you have better food , wholesome food , produced to a better standard , that is the kind of thing people who are doing the buying should be weighing up			2
‘ we do n’t think it should necessarily be that much more expensive			0
’ the current @entity51 document emphasises the importance of quality , locality and animal welfare - but it includes an overarching rule which says the cost of food trumps all other factors			2
that rule will be taken out of the guidelines when they are reissued in the summer , mr @entity29 said			0
@entity7 imports 40 per cent of its food - including many products which could be produced on @entity7 farms the move follows an impassioned plea in january by environment secretary @entity67 for families to cut down on foreign food			1
he was then challenged by the @entity70 to push hospitals and schools to buy @entity7 food rather than simply going to the cheapest source			1
at the time @entity75 , then @entity70 president said : ‘ if @entity67 is going to get the public to buy @entity7 then he should also get the government to buy @entity7			1
we had an event at the @entity81 in may last year and they could not come up with an entirely @entity7 menu for us			2
’ last night @entity84 , head of food and farming at the @entity87 , said : ‘ finally the government is putting its money where its mouth is when it comes to @entity7 agriculture			1
‘ we have campaigned against the @entity2 caveat that food can be sourced locally , as long as it is n’t more expensive			2
farming minister @entity29 wants @entity7 food producers to get a ' proper shot ' at public sector business ‘ if the minister is saying that caveat will be removed , that is very positive news			1
’ conservative mp @entity103 , who sits on the @entity104 , said @entity7 farming needed a boost after a terrible winter of floods and storms			1
‘ this is very good news , ’ he said			0
‘ farming needs to be supported when we have had these weather extremes			2
‘ what is also key is that we do n’t want to be reliant on food imports from abroad			2
’ last month environment secretary @entity67 appointed @entity116 , who led the procurement strategy for the @entity118 , to carry out a review of the @entity51 document			0
he will report back in july			0
a stumbling block to the drive for @entity7 - grown food includes an anti-protectionist @entity125 directive which does not allow public bodies to simply favour products from their own country			1
but mr @entity29 said there are easy ways to ‘ navigate ’ the directive			0
the minister , who himself comes from a farming background , said : ‘ you ca n’t just say “ you have to only buy @entity7 ” but you can say that publicly - procured food should comply with certain standards , standards that are consistent with welfare standards here in the @entity7			1
‘ you can look at whether the food is seasonal , whether it is local , you can look at the length of journey it has had , the impact on the environment , the impact on the benefit to local communities of food being sourced locally			0
‘ and you can in some circumstances include the social benefits locally			0
you can have a more balanced approach to procurement , that do not favour the massive companies that operate on a pan-european basis but that factor in smaller suppliers			0
‘ it ’s about trying to get the balance right			0
‘ that is what we have to try to navigate through			0
’ he added : ‘ sometimes local authorities , for example , can get rather spooked by @entity125 procurement law			0
we are keen to have a close look at @entity125 law and see if we can work around that			0
’ farming bosses say supermarkets also need to play their part by stocking more @entity7 food			1
a poll conducted by @entity174 on behalf of the @entity70 said 79 per cent of shoppers want to see more locally - sourced food on shop shelves			2
former @entity70 president @entity75 , who this week ended his eight - year term at the union , said : ‘ i ’m constantly told by some supermarkets that their sourcing policies are determined by what their customers want			0
this survey shows very clearly that consumers want more @entity7 food , so i hope they will take this on board and act on it			1
‘ we ’re not saying that supermarkets should not stock any foreign produce			0
but we would urge the retailers to listen to what consumers are saying			0
‘ @entity7 farmers and growers provide some of the highest quality produce in the world produced to high standards of quality , welfare and traceability and consumers want to buy it			2
’ the @entity30 revealed last month that quarter of food imported into @entity7 could be produced on home soil			1
some 81 per cent of tomatoes consumed in @entity7 are foreign - grown , as are 59 per cent of mushrooms			1
just 30 per cent of cucumbers are grown here , down from 55 per cent 14 years ago .			2

government is keen to boost farming and end reliance on foreign imports
@entity7 imports 40 per cent of food , but much of it can be grown here
