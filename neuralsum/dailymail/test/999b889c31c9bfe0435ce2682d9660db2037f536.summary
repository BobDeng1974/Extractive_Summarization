first impressions are not necessarily the best			2
when @entity2 scratched around for 22 in a championship match against @entity4 in 2008 , @entity1 branded him a ‘ walking wicket ’			1
‘ but then , ’ @entity1 added			2
‘ he proved us all wrong			2
’ @entity2 , one of six @entity8 players in the @entity10 squad that left @entity11 on thursday for three tests in the @entity13 , hit back in that match seven years ago with a second - innings of 132			1
@entity16 later called him ‘ the find of the season ’			0
@entity8 's @entity2 fields during day three of the @entity20 match against the @entity21 now he finds himself competing with @entity22 to be @entity24 ’s opening partner at the first test in @entity26 on april 13			1
it has been quite a rise			1
‘ i was over the moon when i was told about my selection , ’ he told @entity28			0
‘ i ca n’t wait to get going			0
’ the story of @entity2 ’s ascent , from a talented but inconsistent left - hander to the ballast behind @entity8 ’s charge to the @entity37 last season is one of grit , nous and no little skill			1
he finished with 1,489 runs — more than anyone in the country — six hundreds and a welter of awards			0
in fact , much of the hard work had been done before the season began , prompted by a moderate 2013 which forced him to work on his concentration levels			2
@entity8 ’s sports psychologist @entity52 came up with the idea of harnessing @entity2 ’s love of golf — his handicap is eight — to get him holing one short putt after another			1
the challenge lay not in the task itself , but in its repetition			0
‘ there ’s no skill in sinking a two - foot putt , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ it ’s just about concentration			2
it ’s a bit like batting and not giving your wicket away			0
you try not to do something silly			0
’ after 213 successful putts , he missed			0
but the point had been made			0
@entity2 set about 2014 with renewed focus			1
‘ it was n’t just the concentration side of the game — my confidence changed , too , ’ he said			2
‘ i got runs early on against the university sides , then played well at @entity83			2
it just snowballed from there			0
’ @entity2 plays a shot while batting for @entity8 against the @entity21 at the @entity86 last month at a time when @entity10 ’s @entity90 batsmen have lost the knack of scoring the ‘ daddy hundreds ’ once espoused by former batting coach @entity93 , @entity2 ’s remorselessness caught the selectors ’ eye			1
he made 230 at @entity96 , putting on 375 for the first wicket with the highly rated @entity98 , then 251 against @entity99 at @entity100 , one short of @entity103 ’s @entity102 record			0
‘ one of my things is that i ’ve never got enough runs , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ if you ’re going to get a hundred , you may as well make it a big one			0
’ @entity2 ’s dedication has been evident for years			1
his mum @entity111 would drive him from game to game in his teenage years , and he spent two seasons trialling as a midfielder with @entity116 before deciding to throw in his lot with cricket ( his brother @entity119 played for @entity120 and @entity121 )			1
and his reluctance to talk about his footballing days tells of a man who wants to be judged by his run - making alone			2
when he phoned his mum to tell her about his selection , she was ‘ very emotional ’			0
@entity2 bowls during day three of the @entity20 match against the @entity21 as the home summer got under way with six university fixtures across the country , it was easy to forget that the first - class season actually began late last month in the @entity133			1
and , in the now annual fixture in @entity135 between @entity21 and the champion county , @entity2 made 113 and 46 not out as @entity8 won by nine wickets			1
watching on was @entity24 , who will have a big say in whether he walks out to bat in @entity26 with @entity141 or @entity22 , ready to play again after leaving the @entity143 tour in november 2013 because of a stress - related condition			1
@entity2 is suitably complimentary about a player with 49 test caps to his name and an average pushing 47			1
‘ he deserves his recall			0
he had a fantastic summer with @entity152 and showed his class in @entity154 with the @entity155			0
‘ it ’ll be very hard to keep the likes of him out of the side			0
i ’ve just got to concentrate on myself and impress in the nets			0
’ the putting green may get a visit , too			0
@entity2 is congratulated by team - mate @entity98 ( right ) after taking the wicket of @entity164			1

@entity2 has enjoyed a meteoric rise from his early days with @entity8
he will now battle @entity22 to be @entity24 's opening partner at the first test in @entity26 on april 13
@entity2 has *revealed* how practising golf has helped to improve his concentration
a young @entity2 also spent time trialing as a midfielder with @entity116
