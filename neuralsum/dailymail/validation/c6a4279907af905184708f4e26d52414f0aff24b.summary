it has been a bittersweet week for @entity1			1
on thursday the acclaimed actress was at @entity3 to receive her @entity4 from the @entity5 , a reward for a lifetime of achievement – and almost a dress rehearsal for her new @entity11 role playing the @entity12 in the audience			2
but her delight at the presentation must have involved a moment of quiet reflection , too			2
for last week was also the anniversary of the death of her father , taken from her in a dramatic fighter plane accident almost half a century ago on march 17 , 1966			1
dame @entity1 , 54 – nominated for an @entity24 for her mesmerising role in @entity26 – has said little about the loss in public , but recalled that ‘ @entity28 was pregnant at the time and i can remember when she told us			1
in one breath it was , “ @entity33 has had an accident and wo n’t be coming home and i ’m going to have a baby			2
” so it sort of took the sting out of it ’			2
the exact details of his crash , however , have remained shrouded in secrecy – like so much else associated with the @entity44 – until now , thanks to the release of a recently declassified air investigation report			1
heartbreaking : dame @entity1 was only five when her father was killed in a dramatic fighter plane accident it reveals that lieutenant commander @entity50 was flying a @entity52 jet when it exploded after crashing into the sea off the @entity55 coast			1
he was taking part in a training exercise for a type of mission that has since been described as ‘ perhaps the most stupid , and potentially suicidal attacks ever invented ’			2
the @entity52 was in the vanguard of a new generation of high - speed jets that relied on swept wings and two @entity66 engines to achieve near - supersonic speed			2
they were designed for aircraft carriers for night - time flying and one of their tasks would be to attack @entity74 ships in the event of a war			1
astonishingly , of the 145 @entity77 built , 54 were lost in accidents and 55 crew members killed during the 13 years of frontline service with the @entity81 from 1959 to 1972			2
this was a worse rate of attrition than the notorious @entity85 , which became known as the ‘ @entity86 ’ in @entity87 because 30 per cent were lost to accidents			2
@entity88 , the report reveals , was the designated leader when he and three other @entity52 pilots lined up on the runway on the night of march 17			2
they were tasked with taking off from air base @entity94 , in @entity96 , @entity97 , and attacking a target being pulled by a frigate , @entity99 , off @entity100 in @entity55			1
horrific : lieutenant commander @entity50 was killed during a dangerous night - time training mission with classic military understatement the report states that they faced ‘ unpleasant conditions ’ , which included poor visibility , fog patches and a pitch black night			1
furthermore , it was believed to have been @entity50 ’s first attempt at firing glow worm flares since he had returned to frontline duties after working as a vixen flying instructor			1
the notorious flares were designed to illuminate the target prior to attack but had already been involved in a succession of accidents			0
as the leader , @entity50 was expected to fire off the flares above the frigate so that they would illuminate the target in silhouette			1
the following three @entity77 were then tasked with attacking the dummy ship in quick succession before the leader himself would launch the final attack			0
all four were supposed to roll into a dive before firing off their rockets at the target at a pre-ordained angle and altitude			0
however , the training mission was dogged with bad luck from the outset , with one of the @entity77 failing to make it off the runway			0
the three others took off and assumed the attack formation , with @entity50 in the lead , to a point 20 miles south of @entity99			1
but then @entity142 lost his radar and , after trying to maintain his position , was instructed by @entity50 to return to base			1
this meant that no 3 assumed the no 2 position and the two remaining @entity77 turned to prepare for the attack			0
on their first run , @entity50 failed to fire the flares			1
both planes turned round for a second run , but the new @entity154 struggled to maintain position			0
by the time they were in position for a second strike , the crew of @entity154 suddenly realised that @entity99 had changed its orientation and was now directly behind the target as they approached it			0
worried their missiles could hit the frigate instead of the target it was towing , they aborted the attack for safety reasons			0
the report adds that the crew of @entity154 heard @entity50 call ‘ turning in ’ in preparation for his attack and ‘ some five to ten seconds [ later ] the pilot noticed a flash ’			1
@entity176 ’s crew also saw an explosion , which turned out to be @entity88 ’s aircraft hitting the water and exploding			0
@entity50 was killed instantly and his co-pilot , lieutenant @entity180 , was listed as missing			1
dame @entity1 , born in @entity181 in 1960 , later said that after the news of her father ’s death ‘ we went down to school and everybody had to be nice to us and we did n’t really understand why			1
it ’s only later that you realise what a terrible shock it was			0
i can still remember him			0
it ’s like having a little film playing in your head			0
i can still remember his smell , it ’s really weird			0
the thing that breaks my heart is the smell of engine oil ’			0
indeed , she has been doubly unfortunate			0
@entity1 ’s widowed mother went on to marry another @entity81 pilot , @entity204 , who died in another air accident in 1972			1
lieutenant commander @entity50 was flying a @entity52 jet ( pictured ) when it exploded after crashing into the sea off the @entity55 coast author @entity211 , in his book about the @entity52 , branded the glow worm manoeuvre , for which @entity88 was practising , ‘ perhaps the most stupid , and potentially suicidal attack ever invented			1
once the leader had fired the flares he had to bank left hard , climb to 4,000ft , come up behind the fourth @entity52 , a complex manoeuvre complicated further by the fact he had to switch on his weapons panel , which meant switching hands on the control stick , while turning his head to locate the weapons switch ’			0
all of this was happening while the jet was maintaining a steep bank climb and the pilot was subjected to considerable g - forces			1
it was a recipe for disorientation and disaster			0
the conclusion to the @entity234 report offers little solace , indirectly blaming @entity99 and the exercise			0
sir @entity237 , a former @entity52 pilot , said : ‘ when you are flying at night there is no horizon			2
you have disorientation in relation to the ground or surface , where the ship is			0
you have the disorientation in relation to where the other planes are as you look in and out of the cockpit			0
‘ you are also looking for the weapons switch on your right side and if you are flying with your right hand you either switch hands or reach over with your left hand			2
‘ i can see @entity50 now			1
he was absolutely magical , the most wonderful and enchanting guy			0
there was no better - looking couple and while i can see @entity256 in @entity1 , @entity1 also looks just like her father			1
‘ she has that classic @entity258 look with those high cheekbones			0
@entity50 and @entity256 had star quality			1
life can be so cruel , especially to @entity256			0
she even had a boyfriend between the two @entity263 and he was also killed in a flying accident			2

@entity1 *'s* father died in a dramatic fighter plane accident
lieutenant commander @entity50 was flying a jet when it exploded
crash over @entity55 coast happened in 1966 , when @entity1 was just five
details of the @entity44 tragedy were shrouded in secrecy - until now
