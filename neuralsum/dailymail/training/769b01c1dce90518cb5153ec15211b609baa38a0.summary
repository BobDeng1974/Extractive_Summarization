by @entity1 reporter published : 17:59 est , 28 september 2013 updated : 11:10 est , 29 september 2013 talk about sailing too close to the wind ! charter captain @entity6 , his dog @entity5 and friend @entity3 were cruising around the @entity7 in search of lobster when they were confronted by not one , but five enormous waterspouts			1
but rather than head back to port , the brave boaters pointed their vessel at the heart of one of the twisters and sailed right through			1
the powerful storm caused torrents of water to hit the camera lens			0
' with plenty of lobster in the box , a great opportunity presented itself to film a close encounter with a weather phenomenon , ' @entity6 , who has lived in the @entity7 for more than 20 years , wrote in a post with the clip			1
' this is my third time going through a waterspout in a boat , this one a mere 1/6 of the big waterspout from several years back			0
fortunately , this time i had a video camera ! ' the experienced sailor said he was literally blown away by the close encounter			1
' it 's a low - pressure system so your ears pop. i mentioned in the video that all my hatches had opened straight up in the air , ' @entity6 told @entity60			2
' fortunately nothing got sucked out of the boat			0
it 's a very intense fan , basically			1
' ' calculated risk ' : @entity6 said he has sailed through waterspouts before but has advised other boaters not to take the risk blown away : the sailors said it was lucky they were n't sucked into the twister as they sailed through it , describing it as an ' intense fan ' a waterspout looks like a tornado , with a giant whirling cloud suspended beneath a low - lying cloud , dropping to a body of water			1
@entity6 said he was lucky his boat was n't sucked into the powerful twister			2
' this not for anybody to try ever and this is a delicately calculated risk based on dozens of fluid variables that change by the second , ' he wrote on his @entity32 page			0
' waterspouts are typically short lived @entity88 rated tornadoes on the water with winds under 72mph			2
' this was a likely an @entity88 waterspout , yet was strong enough to completely open my deck hatches and forcibly move the boat more than i expected			0
' the approach was intended to go with the wind at high speed to minimize the effect , yet provide the fullest , safest experience			0
again , do n't ever do this ! if you do , you 're gon na need a bigger boat ! '			0

boaters @entity6 and @entity3 sailed through waterspouts in @entity7
the pair were *diving* for lobsters when they saw five twisters
@entity6 said it felt like ' a very intense fan ' and filmed the close encounter
