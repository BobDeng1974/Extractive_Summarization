@entity0 has admitted he wants to bring in several loan reinforcements at @entity2 in january increasing the chances of @entity4 moving to @entity5 in the winter transfer window			1
asked about likely first signings as @entity2 coach @entity0 said : ' the president has been very good with me and he is going to let me see what i can do			1
my intention is maybe going into the loan market to bring in a couple of players on loan			2
if i can boost the squad and give everybody a lift then i will try to do that			0
' @entity0 brought @entity4 through at @entity20 and with the @entity23 international out of favour under @entity25 a move could suit all parties			1
@entity4 could be reunited with @entity0 when the transfer window re-opens in january @entity4 has made 11 appearances for @entity29 this season ... but could be allowed to leave for @entity5 ' january is never the best time but if there are boys who could come here and help the team and we can have a look at them for six months then we 'll do that , ' he said after sunday 's draw with @entity39			1
a central midfielder and a striker will also be on the former @entity29 manager 's wanted list			1
@entity44 has already scored four goals for his new manager but alongside him 7.5m euros club record signing @entity47 is yet to come any where close to justifying his fee			1
@entity0 said : ' i have told him that sometimes the goals are the last thing to come			2
everybody wants it to be the first thing but the first thing has to be what you do for the team			2
hard workers are always respected			0
@entity44 was exceptional against @entity39 and we had to try to get the ball to him more in the second and we could n't			0
' @entity0 is looking to add to his @entity2 squad in the new year the @entity66 says @entity68 clubs would benefit from a winter break after the @entity71 third round matches @entity2 play a second leg @entity73 cup last - 16 match on wednesday at home to third tier side @entity77			1
the teams drew 0 - 0 in the first leg			0
@entity0 then takes his team to play @entity81 at the weekend and will then experience his first winter break			1
' i have always been an advocate of it , ' he said			0
' if you play in the @entity86 then you have to accept that football is played over the @entity89 and @entity90 period but i think we should have a break after the first game in january , after the @entity71			0
' that 's when people have the least amount of cash in their pocket and when the players have just made a huge effort over @entity89 so i have always thought that two weeks then would be ideal for @entity68 clubs			0
' it is a different scenario here			0
it will be the first @entity89 i have had with my family i although i imagine i 'll probably end up watching a game somewhere on @entity105			0
