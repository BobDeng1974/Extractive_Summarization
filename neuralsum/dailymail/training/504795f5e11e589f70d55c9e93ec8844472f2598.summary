@entity1 may have more than one billion users , but despite so many ‘ connected ’ people , the social network is full of lonely hearts , a new study suggests			1
researchers analysed a collection of studies to conclude that a connection between @entity1 and loneliness exists			2
they said the link is because the feeling of loneliness brings users in search of friendship to @entity1 , rather than the social network making people feel isolated			1
researchers analysed a collection of studies to conclude that a connection between @entity1 and loneliness exists			2
they said the link is because the feeling of loneliness brings users in search of friendship to @entity1 , ( illustrated with a stock image ) rather than the social network making people feel isolated @entity30 , an assistant professor of communication at the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) focused on @entity1 because of its broad appeal			1
the social network accounts for 54 per cent of global users ’ time			1
many pieces of research have sought to investigate the link between @entity1 and loneliness as well as whether interacting with people online harms face - to - face relationships , or enables shy people to connect with others virtually in a meaningful way that they might not manage offline			1
this is known as the ' internet paradox '			0
her team reviewed studies published so far on the topic and found that people have concluded that @entity1 both causes and eases loneliness			1
experts found the lonelier someone is , the longer they spend on @entity1			1
a stock image of a lonely man is pictured professor song found that the lonelier someone is , the longer they spend on @entity1			1
she suggests that this shows @entity1 does not reduce people ’s sense of isolation			0
however , the researchers did not find that @entity1 causes loneliness – only that people use the social network in a bid to feel more connected			1
‘ compared to non-lonely people , lonely people spend more time on @entity1			1
lonely individuals who are shy or have low social support may turn to @entity1 to compensate for their lack of social skills and / or social networks in face - to - face settings , ’ she wrote in the study , published in the journal computers in @entity80			2
‘ the interesting point of this study is that it both supports and corrects the original internet paradox study , which is one of the most influential studies in internet research , ' and was produced by researchers at @entity91			0
she continued : ‘ to the question of whether or not the internet increases psychological dysfunction such as loneliness , the internet paradox study suggested that internet use has detrimental effects			0
our study supports this in that internet use is associated with loneliness			0
‘ however , we found the previously suggested causal direction to be erroneous : lonely people spend more time on the internet rather than internet use making people lonely , ’ professor song said			0
she said that more research is needed to investigate the findings further , including whether young people compensate for loneliness in the same way that older people do			2
@entity115 researchers from @entity117 in @entity118 , @entity115 studied the profiles of 608 female @entity1 users			2
according to the researchers , ‘ half ( 308 ) were categorised as “ connected ” and the remaining 308 users were categorised as " lonely ” ; based on clearly stating this feeling in their latest wall posting			0
’ the study then monitored the publicly available aspects of the profile to see if there was a relationship between loneliness and self - disclosure			0
half of those who were categorised as lonely were more likely to include more personal information on their accounts			0
this ranged from their relationship status to their address and phone number			0
one in eight lonely users also listed their favourite book and film .			0

feelings of loneliness bring users in search of friendship to @entity1
but the social network does *n't* make people feel isolated , according to a study by the @entity32
experts found the lonelier someone is , the longer they spend on @entity1
they studied previous research *papers* to come up with the findings
