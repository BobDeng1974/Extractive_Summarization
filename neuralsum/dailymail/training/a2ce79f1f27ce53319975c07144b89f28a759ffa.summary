only one in 50 people eligible for the government ’s free parenting classes have taken advantage of the scheme , official figures have revealed			0
a £ 5million pilot was set up in a number of poor areas following the 2011 riots in @entity10			1
parents of under - fives would be able to claim £ 100 vouchers to attend classes covering discipline , diet , exercise , family rows , bullying and preparing children for school			1
but just two per cent of families have signed up since it was launched seven months ago			1
@entity24 ( left ) introduced the free parenting classes after the 2011 riots but shadow children 's minister @entity27 accused the prime minister of making ordinary families bear the brunt of cuts to services many of those who did attend classes quickly lost interest			1
one in five quit the courses before they had completed them			0
last week one of the providers withdrew their services , complaining about poor turn - out and red tape			0
@entity43 seized on the statistics yesterday to attack the prime minister ’s record on ‘ family friendly ’ policies			0
shadow children ’s minister @entity27 said : ‘ @entity24 claimed this would be the most family friendly government ever , but he ’s made ordinary families bear the brunt of cuts to services and financial support , and now his flagship parenting programme is in chaos			1
‘ the major issue with the parenting class scheme is that it will never reach those families who need the most help			1
that is why @entity61 centres and outreach programmes are so important , but this government has slashed the budget by more than 40 per cent , with the most deprived areas facing the biggest cuts			1
‘ @entity24 promised he would provide high quality support for parents but he has failed			0
’ a total of 22,000 free classes in four pilot areas - @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 in @entity75 and @entity76 in @entity77 - were announced under the scheme			2
parents would pick up vouchers from boots stores and health workers , entitling them to ten two - hour sessions with organisations such as the @entity85			0
but children ’s charity @entity86 last week pulled out of the scheme after just 32 parents turned up			0
problems had included poor marketing and problems with the issuing of vouchers , it said			0
another provider has complained interest has been slack due to lack of publicity , the @entity95 said yesterday [ @entity99 ]			2
another measure announced last year alongside the parenting classes was a £ 3.4 million website			2
parents who signed up to it would receive information by text message and email on how to bring up children after the prime minister said it was ‘ ludicrous ’ that people receive more training when learning to drive			2
but he was forced to defend the plans amid concerns about an expanding ‘ nanny state ’			0
other government proposals to face criticism include the tax - free childcare vouchers worth £ 1,200 a year per child that are only available to families with two earners			1
and there has been widespread criticism of cuts to child benefit that take effect in any family where an individual earns more than £ 50,000			2
families where two parents both earn just under that sum will be unaffected , meaning they can be paid almost £ 100,000 without losing any benefits			1
the @entity135 said : ‘ the @entity137 trial ... is still being successfully delivered by 13 of the original 14 providers			0
