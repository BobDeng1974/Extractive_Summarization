looking at these pictures of @entity2 the kitten , you ’d think he was distinctly uncomfortable			0
but this is actually the best way for the four - month - old rescue cat to get around – and he ’s perfectly happy with it			1
he was born with bones missing from his front legs , but that has been no handicap for the youngster , who has instead learned to walk on his ‘ elbows ’ and even move along on his back legs			1
an x-ray revealed that @entity2 ’s ulna and radius bones , which connect the upper half of his front legs to his paws , were missing			1
he is now waiting for an operation to replace the bones with metal pins thanks to the efforts of animal charity @entity42			1
cruel : the kitten , which suffers with radial agenesis , had been listed for sale on the advertising website @entity30 by its cruel former owner operation : @entity2 is missing the bones that connect the upper half of the front legs to the paws , but is due to have metal pins fitted as a replacement thanks to animal charity @entity42 in the meantime he is enjoying life at the home of his ‘ foster carer ’ @entity58 , 50 , who said : ‘ he ’s a lovely little thing			1
‘ because @entity2 was born that way he does n’t know there ’s anything wrong with him so he runs around on his elbows and happily plays with my other cat and dog			0
‘ he ’s ok at the moment but if he does n’t get the operation he ’ll start to damage his spine when he gets bigger			0
’ a well - wisher acquired @entity2 from @entity30 in november and handed him in at a @entity42 branch in @entity72			1
@entity74 - fect future : the rescue kitten with ' foster owner ' @entity58 , who says she has never seen a cat with a condition like @entity2 's ' lovely little thing ' : @entity2 is being looked after by @entity58 , who has been fostering cats for 25 years workers , who thought he had simply been born with dislocated legs , took him to a vet , where the x-ray revealed he had radial agenesis , which occurs when an animal ’s leg bones fail to develop			1
the condition can be corrected by implanting metal pins between the paw and upper bone , but an operation can be carried out only on cats over six months old to give the existing bones time to harden and take the weight of the pins			2
@entity42 has raised more than £ 3,000 in only three days so @entity2 can have the life - changing operation when he is six months old			2
rare condition : only four cats have been born with radial agenesis in @entity102 in the past 30 years @entity103 , co-ordinator of @entity42 ’s @entity72 branch , said : ‘ a friend of the branch spotted him on @entity30			2
it said in the advert he had two broken legs but when she got there he had no bones at all			0
she felt sorry for him and took him home but it became clear he needed a lot of treatment and that ’s when we got involved			0
‘ once @entity2 has had the operation , his future looks very bright			0
’ a spokesman for @entity30 , which lets sellers post adverts for free , said : ‘ we have a very strict policy regarding the sale of sick or injured animals on the website			0
‘ we apologise that someone was able to post an advert for @entity2 despite him having medical problems and we will do our best to make sure similar incidents do not occur in the future			0
