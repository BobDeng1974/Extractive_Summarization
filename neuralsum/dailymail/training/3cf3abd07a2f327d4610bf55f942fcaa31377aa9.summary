by @entity0 published : 02:54 est , 1 june 2013 updated : 05:00 est , 1 june 2013 a father and son who ran a haulage business for 99p stores have been found guilty of the manslaughter of one of their drivers who fell asleep at the wheel			1
@entity10 , 54 , and @entity11 , 36 , were convicted of the killing of @entity13 , from @entity14			1
father - of - four mr @entity13 was crushed to death when his 39 tonne @entity18 lorry crashed into a line of stationary traffic on the southbound carriageway of the @entity22			1
convicted : @entity10 , 54 , right , and @entity11 , 36 , left , were convicted of the killing of @entity13 the jury at @entity25 @entity24 was told the death was ' an accident waiting to happen ' as the the mr @entity13 had been working for more than 19 hours and had been driving for over 13 of them			1
road haulage legislation states that truckers can only drive large commercial lorries for a maximum of 10 hours in a 24 hour period , and then only two days a week			2
for the rest of the week , the maximum time they can spend behind the wheel of a lorry is nine hours			1
tachographs are fitted to every large vehicle to record a driver 's activities , but in 35 - year - old mr @entity13 's case two tachograph charts were being used			1
this practice was ' tolerated if not encouraged ' by the @entity46 , who ran @entity48 , based in @entity49 , @entity50 , the jury was told			2
although cabs can be fitted with two tachographs , if there is a relief driver on board , the prosecution said mr @entity13 was using them both when he died and was driving longer hours that legally permitted so he could increase his earnings			1
at the time he had debts of around £ 10,000			2
friends and family noticed how tired he was and how he would often fall asleep in a chair			2
tragic : @entity13 , pictured , was crushed to death when his 39 tonne @entity18 lorry crashed into a line of stationary traffic on southbound carriageway of the @entity22 @entity10 , of @entity49 , and @entity11 , from @entity68 , pleaded not guilty to manslaughter and failing to discharge an employer 's duty			1
after 16 hours and 52 minutes the jury unanimously convicted the father of both charges			1
they found the son guilty of manslaughter by a majority of 10 to 2 and unanimously on the second charge			2
it followed the accident on friday february 12 2010 between junction 10 , the @entity83 exit and junction 9 , the exit for @entity86 and @entity87			2
prosecutor @entity88 told the jury of seven men and five women the case was one of : ' gross negligence and manslaughter			2
' at the time of the fatal crash , the firm worked solely for the shop chain 99p stores , delivering goods to branches up and down the country and collecting waste material such as cardboard packaging and bringing it back to the retail chain 's central depot in @entity49			2
in the five years to february 2010 @entity106 , which had its yard at the depot , had rapidly grown from having two drivers to a fleet of 25 lorries and 40 trailers			2
but the jury was told that the firm 's administration had not kept pace and rarely were there sufficient drivers to do all that was required			2
' drivers were frequently asked to do deliveries that would take them over permitted hours			2
tired drivers pose a risk to themselves and @entity123 is a case about a man who lost his life because the rules were broken , ' said mr @entity127			2
he said the father and son showed a ' flagrant disregard for the law ' in the pursuit of profit			2
mr @entity134 went on : ' his death was the utterly foreseeable consequence of the way the defendants conducted their business			1
it was an accident waiting to happen			2
' their negligence had exposed him ( mr @entity13 ) to the risk of death and that failure had been so reprehensible that it amounted to gross negligence			1
' he said the defendants had failed to carry out any kind of ' risk assessment			0
' moments before the crash a couple travelling south noticed mr @entity13 's lorry drifting form the slow lane towards the middle lane two or three times			1
' he was exhausted and had fallen asleep , ' said the prosecutor			0
as they went past the lorry , mr @entity13 who had left @entity49 , and was on his way to @entity161 with a delivery , could be seen rubbing his eyes			1
ahead traffic was slowing because of congestion and a lorry in front of mr @entity13 's vehicle had come to a halt at the rear of a line of stationary traffic			1
the jury heard despite braking hard at the last moment , mr @entity13 crashed into the back of the lorry in front			1
his cab was crushed and he received serious head and chest injuries			1
he was pronounced dead at the scene at 2.26am that morning			0
the tachographs showed he had been at work since 5am the previous morning			0
he had been on duty for 19 hours and 15 minutes , and had been driving for 13 hours and 8 minutes , covering 592 miles			0
the court was told the father and son were not monitoring the tachograph charts of their drivers as they should have been			0
they should also have retained the drivers ' charts for a year			0
mr @entity134 said they were required to employ a ' qualified transport manager ' which was never done and claims that the head office for @entity48 was in @entity196 were false			0
records were not kept to show when vehicles had been maintained			0
mr @entity127 added : ' they failed to take steps to reduce the risk to drivers and to the public			0
they repeatedly exposed him to risk of death by asking him to work longer hours than he should have			1
this was a wilful disregard of the tachograph law			0
' the breaches amount to criminal offences and they put profit before safety			0
it was an accident waiting to happen in the context of a business where every corner was cut			0
' not just the drivers but the public had been put at risk			0
giving evidence @entity221 told the jury he thought the @entity18 lorry was in the yard and was not being driven by mr @entity226 , who had worked for him since late 2009 , when it crashed			1
he said that he and all the other drivers were paid in cash and were left to sort out their own tax and @entity232			0
there were no difficulties with his work , but on january 27 2010 , a lorry he was driving was written off after it jack - knifed on road works on the motorway			1
' someone stopped in front of him			0
he was coming to the end of the road works and someone nipped in in front of him , ' he said			0
asked if he took any action against mr @entity13 , he replied : ' no , accidents happen , ' he replied.he said he had not been responsible for the drivers ' running list on the day of the accident and the days before			1
he said he saw mr @entity250 at 9pm that night in the lorry in the yard			1
he said he knew mr @entity13 sometimes slept in the cab			1
he was asleep when he got a phone call from his ex-wife in @entity196 , who had been contacted by the police to say that mr @entity10 himself had been killed in a road accident			1
' i said " it 's not me "			0
' officers then contacted him and told him there had been an accident on the motorway			0
he said when the police told him the lorry involved he said : ' that ca n't be right			1
i thought the vehicle was in the yard			0
' asked how he felt when he heard of the news of mr @entity13 's death he said : ' you did n't want to see anyone die			1
i was very much upset			0
' his son did not give evidence			0
reporting of the case which finished earlier this month was subject to a contempt of court order because the father and son faced trial for cheating the @entity283 and @entity284			0
but they changed their pleas yesterday			0
