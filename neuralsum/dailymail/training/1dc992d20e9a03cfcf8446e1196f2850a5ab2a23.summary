yesterday we brought you what we thought were the most awkward @entity4 photos of all time , but overnight , more snaps have surfaced of families grimacing in seasonal attire			1
as families start sending out their @entity4 cards , many - like @entity10 and @entity11 earlier this week - will have opted for the personal touch , printing seasonal snaps featuring loved ones , children and pets			1
but as the former prime minister and his barrister wife 's annual greeting proves , festive portraits have the potential to inspire more ha ha ha 's than ho ho ho			1
these pictures show the cringe - inducing lengths some parents will go to produce the ultimate holiday greeting even if that means stripping off , cuddling bizarre pets , dressing in matching tartan or even donning @entity31			1
one family even braved the winter chill to strip down and show off their brand new hot tub			2

this family braved the winter chill to strip down and show off their brand new hot tub one father dresses up as his own baby ( left ) while another little one is decorated in a straitjacket of fairy lights ( right ) resembling a snap from an office party , this family strip off for a naughty festive portrait bad santas with a black eye , matching @entity4 jumpers and dad naked by the dinner table , these photographs are definitely on the naughty list			1
there are a few turkeys in this festive photo album as the most wonderful time of the year is captured in all its awkward glory			0
some went even further , dropping the swimming trunks and bikinis , favouring a fig leaf - instead of mistletoe - to cover their modesty in saucy family shot			0
one family attempted to pose as @entity79 and his reindeer but just ended up looking like a disjointed human centipede			0
while others demonstrated that pets such as budgies , a duck and birds of prey and are always risky props			0
others covered up in the retro - styled @entity4 jumpers that are all the rage at the moment but some of these festive frights are more suited to @entity94			2
a pair of playfighting siblings are captured mid-scrap in an angelic studio - style setting two none - the - wiser sisters perch next to a sinister - looking @entity79 this @entity4 appears to be dozing off as the baby on his knee looks worried the pole seems the ideal spot to capture that wholesome family photo ( left ) , meanwhile one member of the family on the right has decided she 's having none of it this toddler dressed as a gingerbread man is pulling her angriest face but still looks adorable although even the worst woollen wear ca n't match one family 's own tie - dye fashion disaster			1
they at least took the trouble to co-ordinate their clobber			0
one dad decided to ruin his relative 's festive memories by secretly getting his kit off just before he said cheese			0
the smile on children 's faces at @entity4 often makes the months of work that parents put in to finding the perfect present all worth it			2
but instead their kid 's terrible tantrums and tears have been turned into cherished memories in these pics			0
one naughty boy was even wrapped up in @entity4 lights as a punishment - @entity79 surely did n't visit him that year			2
even old mr @entity79 himself has been risking the sack with a few creepy pictures			0
some people go all - out when it comes to dressing up , like this family of festive presents a greetings card from a loved - up couple ( left ) and a pair of siblings who seem to have the holiday mixed up ( right ) one little girl knows how to get her own way when it comes to sharing , as proven in this family shot these children are wondering why on earth mum and dad brought them to see @entity4 - clearly not fans this family ditched the @entity4 sweaters and opted for just a fig leaf to cover their modesty @entity163 were snapped letting beards slip , dozing after a few too many sherries and one bad @entity79 even boasted a black eye			2
this album of awkwardness certainly proves the saying you can ' pick your friends but you ca n't pick your family ' is true			0
nothing looks quite as uncomfortable as matching outfits , except , of course , when just one member of the family decides to just dispense with clothes altogether			0
but perhaps it 's worth treasuring these photos , as next time you feel a little embarrassed about being in a family snap at @entity4 , you will remember it could be a lot worse			1
@entity185 has been top of the tree for priceless family memories since it was set - up by childhood friends @entity190 and @entity191			0
share your awkward @entity4 family photos ! send us your name , location and picture to @entity197 @entity185 has been top of the tree for priceless memories since the site was set - up by @entity190 and @entity191 something 's roasting by an open fire but it 's not chestnuts ... a father - of - two sheds his clothes in this funny family @entity4 shot mum goes for a @entity31 santa outfit complete with garter belt , left , while , right , proud parents showcase their children 's swimming talents @entity216 , put it away ! you can tell who likes to sleep naked in this family photo where all members - bar one - are wearing pyjamas these children are not too happy to be meeting @entity4			1
one little girl sulks while another bursts into tears this family attempts to resemble @entity79 and his reindeer but proves that just because you can photoshop your snaps does n't mean you should spot the odd pet out : this dog 's owners are absolutely quackers about budgies and birds - even insisting the duck look straight at the camera it may be true that owners and their dogs look alike - but dress the same too ? it 's still not clear where the doll fits in in this surreal tableau who 's game ? welcome to the house where children cuddle dachshunds while their mullet - haired parents show off the family 's birds of prey tartan army : this family captures the moment when each member is a head taller than the other - and willing to wear a red plaid nightie the strangest @entity4 jumpers , left , and the most forced @entity4 smiles ( or grimaces ) , right , we 've ever seen forced into red onesies and wearing glasses that time and taste forgot - who can blame the children for their stony expressions ?			1

@entity10 and @entity11 's annual @entity4 greeting has been ridiculed since being *unveiled* this week
but they *'re* not the only ones , as old photos show other families ' ill - *judged* snaps over the years
pictures from the @entity281 blog feature bizarre poses , weird pets and *misguided* *nudity*
