when @entity2 wants something , @entity1 ’s manager comes into his own			1
the capture of @entity6 from @entity7 was no exception			2
the moment he was tipped off that the @entity11 ’ sporting director @entity10 had told fabregas he could leave the @entity12 , @entity2 went to work at breathtaking speed			2
he flew to @entity14 to meet @entity6 days after @entity7 ’s final @entity16 game of the season against @entity18 on may 17			1
the @entity14 midfielder was blown away by the gesture			2
@entity2 ( left ) pulled out all the stop to acquire the signature of @entity6 ( above ) @entity6 has scored one goal and bagged seven assists in a blue shirt so far this season @entity2 made @entity6 feel special again , a wanted man after three largely frustrating years in the shadow of his great friend @entity28			1
these grand gestures are @entity2 ’s speciality			0
getting the personal treatment from a coach who has won titles in @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity14 — and twice lifted the @entity37 — usually does the trick			0
famously , @entity2 met @entity39 in @entity41 ’s @entity40 in january 2005 ( without @entity43 ’s permission ) and also gave @entity44 a tour of his @entity47 townhouse in @entity48 when the player left @entity50 in 2007			1
this summer , @entity1 ’s manager , who had decided to return to the family home in @entity34 instead of travelling to the @entity54 , wanted his transfer business done early			0
blowing the league title , when @entity1 were in with a chance of winning it until his proud unbeaten home record was taken by @entity61 , had irritated him			0
@entity2 ’s pitch to @entity6 , the promise of a position of his own in @entity1 ’s midfield and the prospect of being the link man for @entity69 , convinced him to return to @entity41			1
@entity6 talks to @entity43 manager @entity71 ( right ) during a pre-season tour in 2004 @entity6 learned his trade under @entity71 and soon became the @entity75 club captain @entity6 listens to his mentor wenger back in february 2011 during the summer , @entity2 used the imminent signing of @entity69 ( left ) to seduce @entity6 by then he knew that @entity78 would leave @entity79 after 13 years and @entity6 could be the main man for @entity1 for the next five years			1
@entity78 was earning £ 150,000 a week in his final year at @entity1 and his departure had left a big hole in the budget			1
@entity1 could easily afford @entity6 ’ salary demands			1
@entity2 was familiar with @entity43 ’s buy - back clause , the agreement reached with @entity7 in 2011 when he returned home in a deal worth £ 35million			2
knowing that @entity43 traditionally move slowly on transfers , @entity2 believed he had time			2
the biggest threat was @entity90			0
@entity6 had scored against @entity90 in the @entity37 last season , opening the scoring at the @entity12 when @entity7 ran out 2 - 1 winners in the second leg of the knockout stage			0
@entity90 declared their interest but believed @entity6 would wait until after the @entity54 in @entity97 before deciding about his future			0
@entity99 were keen too , but also waited while @entity100 was leading @entity101 to the semi-finals in @entity97			0
as early as january this year , when rumours began to circulate that @entity6 would be leaving @entity7 , @entity1 ’s technical department started to log his performances			1
@entity2 , using a specially designed app on his @entity108 , was monitoring his targets as the season came to a close			1
@entity1 ’s manager loves that device			0
@entity78 's ( above ) exit left a big hole in @entity1 's budget , meaning they could afford @entity6 @entity6 has had several run - ins with @entity78 , including this incident in the 2007 @entity120 final the @entity121 spent a difficult three years at @entity7 , playing in @entity28 's ( left ) shadow @entity1 's only concern was the delicate issue of @entity6 's relationship with his girlfriend , @entity126 @entity127 , @entity1 ’s head of international scouts , had delegated different members of staff to travel to every @entity18 fixture			1
ostensibly they were present to monitor the form of @entity133 , but it also gave cover for their pursuit of @entity69			0
suddenly , @entity6 was also on the list of players routinely monitored by @entity1			1
a dossier was built up , a picture of his playing career and personal life as they weighed up the possibility of spending £ 40m , along with a five - year contract worth £ 160,000 plus bonuses			0
on the field he ticked every box			0
off the field there was the delicate issue of his relationship with his girlfriend , @entity126			0
her ex-husband , @entity153 , is based in @entity41 and he dragged @entity6 ’ name into a complicated divorce settlement in the capital ’s @entity157 last year			0
it has been far from amicable			0
that messy divorce was @entity1 ’s only concern , but from the moment @entity6 became available , @entity2 decided he was his man			1
after @entity6 met @entity10 a few days after @entity7 were beaten to @entity16 by @entity18 , he was free to leave			0
@entity6 ( left ) celebrates @entity163 's second half goal against @entity90 last month the 27 - year - old keeps the ball away from @entity166 ( right ) during @entity1 's training session on friday as if sunday ’s @entity6 reunion is n’t intriguing enough , @entity168 and @entity169 also have previous			1
@entity168 was sent off for kneeing the @entity7 forward , now at @entity43 , which ruled him out of @entity1 ’s @entity37 win in 2012			2
@entity2 met @entity6 in @entity14 , talking to the midfielder for hours about his future and his role in the @entity1 team			1
@entity6 had become frustrated at the @entity12 and was never really considered a true @entity7 player by the hardcore supporters			0
they saw him as a homegrown talent who left the legendary @entity182 academy in 2003 for buttons and it had cost the @entity11 £ 35m to bring him home			0
to them , it did n’t make sense			0
for his part , @entity2 told the player that his work at @entity43 was done and that @entity1 would dominate domestic football in this country			1
@entity71 , remember , has never beaten one of @entity2 ’s teams			2
@entity168 ( left ) was sent off for kneeing @entity169 during a @entity37 semi-final in 2012 @entity6 takes on the @entity196 defence during @entity1 's 1 - 0 win on tuesday night that day , @entity6 agreed to join @entity1 and accept the consequences from the @entity43 fans who once idolised him			1
on june 12 , 2014 , the day before @entity14 ’s opening game against @entity101 at the @entity54 , @entity1 announced his arrival on a five - year deal			2
@entity71 has always insisted that he decided not to activate the clause in @entity6 ’ contract that gave @entity43 first refusal when he decided to return to @entity41			1
yesterday , though , when @entity43 ’s manager was asked ‘ ultimately , whose decision was it ( not to return ) ? ’ he answered emphatically : ‘ @entity6 ’			2
’ the reality is that @entity2 had outmanouevred him			0
