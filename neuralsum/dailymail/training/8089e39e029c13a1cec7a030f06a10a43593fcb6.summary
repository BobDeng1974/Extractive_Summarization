despite delighting @entity2 taste buds for 52 years , it seems the @entity4 recipe is n't sacrosanct to its new @entity6 owners			0
they ’ve tinkered with the traditional formula by getting rid of the much - loved @entity10 shell and instead using what critics say is an inferior and nasty chocolate			1
the swap has left a bitter taste in the mouths of @entity4 fans , with many taking to @entity20 ’s @entity19 feed and @entity22 page to express outrage			0
@entity24 has reportedly changed the shell of the @entity4 , pictured , and is now using a standard cocoa mix rather than dairy milk ‘ they taste really cheap and poor quality this year – # refund , ’ wrote one yesterday			1
another complained : ‘ why oh why did you sell out to @entity33 ? their sweeties are awful			0
’ and @entity35 asked the question on most people ’s lips : ‘ why mess with the @entity40 ? no need ! ’ @entity20 , which makes 200 million @entity42 a year , met each complaint with the same reply : ‘ our eggs still consist of the @entity24 milk chocolate and yummy creme centre fundamentals they always have			1
’ the @entity49 - based company denied the new chocolate was a cheap substitute – insisting it was virtually identical to @entity10 in that it was a blend of the same milk , cocoa and sugar			1
however , analysis of the ingredients reveals there is less cocoa – 14 per cent compared with 20 per cent in @entity10 – so it is probably cheaper to make			0
and the difference certainly has n’t fooled consumers			0
@entity4 fan @entity64 blasted : ‘ it ’s not the same chocolate recipe – please stop lying to us ! ’ chocolate giant @entity24 have downsized its boxes of @entity40 and are now selling them in packs of five previously , the chocolate treats were sold in boxes of six and making the boxes smaller has angered some chocolate fans many @entity24 customers took to to @entity19 to complain about the reduction in @entity40 found in each box creme eggs have been part of @entity2 culture since 1963 , when they were introduced by @entity24 as @entity81 ’s @entity42			1
the name was changed in 1971 but the taste of the iconic @entity85 treat had remained the same			0
now @entity20 has not just meddled with that recipe – it has also changed the size of the popular multipacks			2
yesterday the @entity90 told how the number of eggs in each pack has been cut from six to five , meaning the cost per egg has risen from 50.8p to 57p			1
the new recipe was taste - tested with consumers before the eggs went on sale this month , a @entity20 spokesman said			1
‘ the fundamentals of @entity4 remain exactly the same – delicious milk chocolate and the unique creme centre that consumers love			1
’ he explained that the decision to use a new recipe ‘ meant we could utilise our chocolate supplies within the factory more efficiently ’			2
it ’s not the first time that @entity20 , which paid £ 11.5 billion for @entity24 in a controversial 2010 deal , has come under fire for undermining the historic @entity2 brand			2
bosses have never been forgiven for reneging on a promise to keep open a @entity24 factory at @entity119 , near @entity120 , in 2011			2
they were also criticised for shifting large parts of their chocolate production to cheaper facilities in @entity125			0
@entity24 chocolates have been getting smaller , too , with the 140g bar of @entity10 shrinking to 120g , and tins of @entity129 being pruned from 975g to 753g			0

@entity24 has reportedly changed the recipe of the shell of @entity40
now using a standard cocoa mix for the chocolate rather than dairy milk
consumers have been left *disappointed* saying chocolate tastes cheap
but spokesman says new shell recipe is the best one for @entity40
comes after chocolate giant cut number of eggs sold in box from 6 to 5
many shops sell pack for £ 2 - the same price that was used before change
