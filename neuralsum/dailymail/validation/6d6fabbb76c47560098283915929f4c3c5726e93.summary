when all these people support you , you want to be able to perform			2
' he 's probably the most dangerous guy in the division in my opinion			1
i think he ’ s a great competitor			2
he ’s got a solid , well - rounded game , he ’s a great kickboxer , amazing jujitsu , i just feel like his biggest strength is his heart			2
he does n’t quit , he just keeps coming			2
. ' his biggest weakness is that he ’s never fought a guy like me			2
i feel like my angles and the things i throw in the @entity37 are second to none			0
i need a knockout , it ’s been a long time since my last knockout and i ’m not going past the first round			1
' he 's a good fighter , but i 'm a great fighter			1
' @entity45 has won his last three bouts , including a stunning first - round knockout of @entity5 last august			1
and he has no fear about being the underdog once again			1
' i am going to go in there and take my belt , ' he said			0
' i do not know how the fight is going to go , but i know it will not go to the judges			1
i will not allow the judges to decide and it will not go five rounds			0
' i will pressure him like i pressure all my fights			0
i will be ready for his style and he will not be ready for my power			0
i am going in there to take my belt			0
that is all i want from him			0
' i am very excited to be the first lightweight champion from @entity67			1
the belt has a date to be mine and that will be saturday			1
it 's in @entity74 's hands			1
' it does not bother me to be an underdog			1
i am an underdog in most of my fights			1
maybe it is a good thing for me , he has all the pressure			0
' @entity8 @entity82 faces off with her @entity84 opponent @entity83 ahead of their title fight the @entity8 fighter smiles to the camera during the weigh - in			1
she has vowed to end the bout in 14 seconds @entity84 fighter @entity91 poses on the scales in saturday 's co-main event , @entity91 bids to become the first @entity96 female @entity6 champion when she takes on @entity82 for the strawweight title			1
' they [ the fans ] see me as the champion because i 'm going to be on saturday anyway , ' she said			1
' i think @entity82 is just focused on her wrestling and i 've already shown i can beat that			0
so , good luck to her			0
' the @entity6 saw that i 'm ready and i can handle it [ the title shot ]			2
i was born for this			0
i 'm comfortable and i 'm treating it as any other fight			2
' but @entity107 plans to upset the @entity109 's party with an early finish			2
' i 'm hoping the fight is going to go how everyone thinks it 'll go ; grappler takes striker down and grappler wins			2
my goal is to do it in under 14 seconds , ' she said			0
' i feel like i 'm most likely going to have the strength advantage ; i feel like with longer , lankier athletes they 're not as strong as athletes with my build			0
' i only care about winning fights ; i do n’t care about the hype or promotion behind it			0
if i 'm not the champ the hype and talk does n't matter			0
' i think female @entity131 is the biggest female sport out there			0
we 're being put on the same stage as the men and sometimes headlining in @entity137 [ @entity139 ’s ] case			0
we 're on top right now			0

@entity0 will defend his lightweight title against @entity2
he is predicting a knockout win , but has hailed @entity45 ' strengths
@entity45 won his three last bouts including a ko of @entity5
but the @entity67 will go into saturday 's title fight as the underdog
