since the dawn of the space age just a few hundred astronauts have joined an exclusive club of humans who have seen @entity6 from space			1
but now you too can join in the adventure thanks to cameras that were recently installed on the @entity11 ( @entity11 )			1
@entity15 ’s @entity14 ( @entity13 ) experiment allows you to watch our planet live as the station hurtles around			1
watch livestream below the @entity13 investigation placed four different commercial high definition cameras on the @entity11 these were installed on the @entity23 , two identical l - shaped consoles located outside the station in space that host a variety of experiments			1
construction of the @entity11 began on 20 november 1998			2
it supports a crew of up to six , with crews split into groups of three			0
the station orbits at a height of about 264 miles ( 425 kilometres )			0
it has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds ( 450,000 kilograms ) and has liveable space roughly equivalent to a five - bedroom house			0
it completes an orbit of @entity6 every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles ( 27,600 kilometres ) per hour			0
it has now been in space for more than 5,600 days , during which time it has completed more than 88,000 orbits of @entity6 , and has been continuously occupied for over 13 years			2
while one of the stated goals of the mission is to assess the ability of such hardware to survive in the vacuum of space , the educational benefits are also plain to see			0
the experiment was launched on 18 april 2014 inside @entity54 ’s @entity53 before being installed outside the station on 30 april			0
do n’t be alarmed if the screen appears black sometimes – the @entity11 orbits the @entity6 approximately every 90 minutes , and about half of that time is spent in darkness while on the night side of @entity6			1
there is also an occasional loss of signal , but otherwise the stream seems to be operating nominally			0
students in the @entity66 helped design some of the cameras ’ components through the @entity69 with @entity15 to create hardware ( @entity71 ) programme			2
teams of students are also responsible for operating the cameras from @entity6 as they transmit footage to the ground in real time			1
on 30 april the @entity14 ( @entity13 ) experiment was installed outside the @entity11 on the @entity78			1
the four cameras on the experiment , view out of one pictured here , stream live video of @entity6 from the @entity11 to the ground in real - time the @entity13 unit was taken into space by @entity54 's @entity53 on 18 april ( top left )			1
at the end of the month it was then removed from the rear ' trunk ' of the spacecraft by the @entity92 robotic arm on the station ( bottom left ) and then installed on the @entity96 module ( top right and bottom right ) the cameras used are commercial - off - the - shelf ( @entity101 ) cameras , which are fixed to the station with no zoom , pan or tilt mechanisms			2
one of the cameras points down towards @entity6 ( nadir ) , one points forward in the direction the station is travelling and two look backwards ( aft )			2
the cameras are n’t quite exposed to the full harshness of space , however , as they are enclosed in a pressurised box containing dry nitrogen			0
as the @entity11 moves over @entity6 the cameras ‘ track ’ locations below by switching feeds			1
only one camera is operational at any one time but they work in tandem			0
the forward camera is turned on for 138 seconds , before switching to the downwards camera for 85 seconds			0
the view then switches to the first rear camera for 133 seconds , which also has part of the solar array and two docking ports in its view , before jumping to the other rear camera for 112 seconds			2
then the system resets for 15 seconds and switches back to the forwards camera , and the cycle starts again			0
if desired , ground controllers can choose to alter the cycle and switch to a different camera , though , if for example something of particular interest is spotted			0
the @entity13 experiment is expected to remain operational until october 2015 , so you ’ll have plenty of time to continue watching @entity6 live from space			1
and later this year a separate endeavour known as @entity149 will be installed on the @entity11 , which will enable members of the public to zoom and navigate through a higher definition live stream of @entity6			1
urthecast say this will let people watch events on @entity6 unfold in real - time from space			1
as the @entity11 moves over @entity6 the cameras ' track ' locations below by switching feeds			1
only one camera is operational at any one time but they work in tandem as shown in this diagram			0
if desired ground controllers can choose to alter the cycle and switch to a different camera			0

@entity15 has installed four external cameras on the @entity11
they are part of the @entity14 ( @entity13 ) experiment
this allows members of the public to watch a real - time feed of @entity6
the view switches between the cameras to ' track ' locations below
live footage will continue to be streamed until october 2015
