but i hated how much weight i 'd put on , i was a size 26 and could n't look at myself in the mirror			1

i could n't fit in a pair of jeans , the only things i could ever wear was leggings			0
' it was an embarrassing incident abroad that was the last straw for @entity1			1
she said : ' i was going on holiday with my friends to @entity53 and i could n't fit the plane seat belt around me			0
i had to be given an extension and it was just mortifying			0
' the holiday was horrible because i felt so awful - walking around in the heat made me so hot , and lying on the beach made me feel so uncomfortable			0

she explained : ' the doctors had referred me to a weight loss management programme , but apart from half a stone here and there i was n't very successful			0
' but when @entity1 told me she wanted me to go with her ( to @entity63 ) i thought it was the perfect opportunity			1
before i was eating massive portions - i 'd pile my food up into a mountain on my plate			0
i would n't eat anything at lunch , instead i 'd just munch on chocolate and junk food throughout the day			2
' bad habits : before embarking on their diet @entity1 and @entity0 would snack on chocolate bars every single day , even having chocolate for breakfast transformed : @entity0 was told by her doctor that she needed to lose weight ( left ) but she struggled to get herself motivated before @entity1 decided to do it with her simmed down : @entity1 proudly shows off her weightloss certificate and new figure the pair went to their first @entity63 meet just 15 months ago and have n't looked back			1

@entity1 has kept me going and her weight loss has been an inspiration to me			2
' if it was n't for her i 'd have given up months ago			0
i feel so much better now and i go to the gym between four and five times a week			0
