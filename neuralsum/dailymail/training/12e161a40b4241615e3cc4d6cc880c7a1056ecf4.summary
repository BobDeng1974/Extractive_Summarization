by @entity0 on the run : @entity2 , of @entity3 , @entity4 , is now recovering and has grown two inches in three months a 17 - year - old boy has finally hit puberty after a four - year fight with anorexia stunted his growth			1
@entity2 , of @entity3 , @entity4 , developed an eating disorder aged 12 , when he was dropped from his local football team - and believed he was ‘ too fat ’ to play			1
desperate to become fitter , he started compulsively exercising and throwing away his lunch , shrinking to just 5st 3lbs			1
at his worst , he stopped eating and drinking completely			2
@entity2 is now recovering and has grown 2in in three months			1
but the 5ft 5in teenager said his eating and weight problems began in may 2009 when he was dropped from his football team			1
combined with the death of a family friend and the pressures of school exams , this triggered negative thoughts about his body			0
at home in the evenings , while his mother @entity26 , 44 , father @entity27 , 46 , and sister @entity28 , 12 , sat watching television , @entity2 would work out in his room , performing up to 500 crunches and push - ups			1
concerned about his shrinking figure , his parents took him to his gp where he was told he was borderline underweight and needed to be monitored			0
within a month he had dropped another 5lbs and was taken back to the doctors , who referred him with a suspected eating disorder to @entity38 ( @entity38 ) for help			1
@entity2 was hospitalised in may 2010 weighing just 5st 8lbs and was not allowed to walk around			1
he had to use a wheelchair to stop him from exerting his body			0
his mother @entity42 , a teaching assistant , said : ‘ we were helpless to make him eat - he would n’t listen to any of us			2
it was heart - breaking to witness him slowly starving himself			2
’ at first , @entity2 refused to eat and would spit his food into rolls of tissue paper while pretending to sneeze or blow his nose			1
but , after six weeks of treatment and bed rest he eventually relented and managed small portions			0
he was finally discharged , but back at home he struggled to eat and continued to exercise			0
he said : ‘ as soon as i got home i went back to my old habits			0
i was desperate to lose the weight again			0
i had weigh - ins twice a week and my weight would fluctuate			2
i was torn between getting better and not wanting to gain weight			0
’ mrs @entity42 was forced to physically restrain him from exercising			2
she said : ‘ from 7am to 11pm @entity2 had to be watched			1
family : @entity2 is pictured ( from left ) with his mother @entity26 , 44 , father @entity27 , 46 , and sister @entity28 , 12			1
the boy developed an eating disorder aged 12 , when he was dropped from his local football team stunted growth : @entity2 is pictured ( left ) with his sister @entity28 , before he was ill , on a beach holiday in @entity71 , @entity72 ; and ( right ) with her on day release during his treatment aged 13 ' he was too sick to attend school so i had to take time off work to monitor him			1
he would n’t sit down at all during the day - the only time he would rest his frail body was at night when he slept			2
’ despite the pain and the constant feeling of exhaustion , @entity2 could not break free from his obsession and he continued to restrict his body of food and drink			1
his anorexia sparked an all - consuming obsessive – compulsive disorder , leading him to exercise more than four hours a day			1
mrs @entity42 would chase him around the garden , pleading with him to stop , but he refused , terrified that his body would stop burning calories			0
at his worst , @entity2 stopped drinking for days , refusing to brush his teeth in fear that just a drop of water would see him gain weight			1
his lips were badly cracked from the dehydration			0
but in july 2010 , @entity2 was admitted for treatment at @entity103 children ’s psychiatric unit in @entity104			1
he weighed 5st 3lbs and was told he would have to be tube fed if he did n’t begin to eat			0
anorexia : @entity2 with his mother @entity26 , and sister @entity28 , on a home visit during treatment , aged 13 he said : ‘ i remember waking up to a nurse putting @entity112 on my cracked lips			1
i became so angry and aggressive that it might somehow make me put on weight			0
by this point i just wanted to die			0
’ puberty sees children mature sexually and their reproductive organs become functional			0
it starts for most boys at 12 , while girls start developing from 11 on average , and it is caused by a release of sex hormones			2
puberty causes rapid growth spurts , as well as the development of breasts in girls and an increase in boys ' penis size			0
there also psychological changes that can see teenagers become self - conscious , aggressive and moody - and behavioural differences that lead teenagers to experiment with potentially dangerous activities such as smoking or sex			2
early or delayed puberty in children - such as @entity2 - can be caused by an underlying condition , such as a long - term illness			1
on his 13th birthday , @entity2 collapsed and suffered a seizure and was rushed to an accident and emergency department where he was given fluids to raise his blood pressure and blood sugar levels			1
after 10 months of intensive treatment and therapy , @entity2 was allowed back home , but his body was so damaged by the anorexia that his growth had been stunted - and doctors warned he may never go through puberty			1
@entity2 gradually started to eat with his family at mealtimes , but it took him more than two hours to finish a meal			1
he continued to receive treatment and counselling , but life was still a struggle			0
two years later in june 2013 , @entity2 bumped into family friend and personal trainer @entity168 , who suffers from cystic fibrosis			1
the teenager was impressed by mr @entity168 ’s muscly physique and - after talking to him about health and fitness - @entity173 decided he wanted to have a man ’s body , and found the motivation to get better			2
@entity2 said : ‘ when i saw @entity168 i was in awe			1
he was a really fit , healthy guy and he has taught me a healthy approach to food and exercise			0
’ getting better : @entity2 ( left ) , with his sister @entity28 on day release during his treatment aged 13 , and ( right ) with personal trainer @entity168 , last december , weighing 8st 6lbs the pair became friends and @entity2 ’s body gradually started to recover and he was determined never to go back to hospital again			1
help : @entity2 trains with family friend @entity168 , who suffers from cystic fibrosis , every six weeks he now consumes 3,500 calories , eating between six and eight nutritional meals a day			1
he said : ‘ i became more positive and began to eat , increasing my calorie intake			0
@entity168 got me off my “ safe foods ” and i now eat peanut butter , as well as lots of protein			0
‘ to me , @entity168 is my superhero and helped saved me from anorexia			0
when i look at pictures of me when i was ill and me today there is such a difference			0
i do n’t recognise the old me and never want to return to that			0
@entity2 , who now weighs a healthy 8st 8lbs , trains with mr @entity168 every six weeks			2
he said : ‘ i ’m so thankful to be given a second chance and i want to inspire others and show them they can beat it			0
’ mr @entity168 , 24 , said : ‘ when i first met @entity2 he was still in the grips of anorexia			2
he was very malnourished and still battling his demons			0
‘ he used to tell me he wanted to look like me , but i told him he needs to be himself			0
since he started working with me there has been such a change			2
i wanted to help him hit puberty and now he ’s becoming a strong minded man			0
‘ less than a year ago he weighed 6st 8lbs and now he is 8st 8lbs			0
i ’m really proud of what he ’s achieved - he ’s a strong lad and i hope he continues on the road to recovery			2
’ mrs @entity42 said : ‘ i am so thankful to everyone who has helped @entity2 with his recovery			2
