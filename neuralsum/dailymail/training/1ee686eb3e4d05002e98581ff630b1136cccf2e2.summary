a couple who made a harrowing video of their baby boy being taken away by social workers at six hours old yesterday backed a senior judge ’s call to expose family courts to ‘ the glare of publicity ’			1
the parents secretly filmed the moment council staff seized their fourth child after being told they were not capable of looking after his elder siblings			1
they then posted the clip online			2
the footage shows the 36 - year - old mother , who has learning difficulties , screaming ‘ no ! ’ as social workers warn they will ‘ get physical ’ if the couple resist			1
scroll down video the six - hour - old baby is cradled by its father as a police officer stands close by in the secretly recorded video the mother is clearly distraught in the video as @entity30 social workers and police take the baby away yesterday her husband backed sir @entity35 ’s attack on the secrecy which shrouds @entity38 ’s family courts as he rejected the local council ’s bid for an injunction to suppress the video			1
the injunction was also designed to prevent anyone knowing the names of the social workers , or discovering the name of the local authority that applied for the order , @entity50			1
sir @entity35 , president of the @entity52 of the @entity52 , also rejected the council ’s bid to bar the father from sharing information about the case			2
and in a dramatic intervention , he said there was a ‘ pressing need ’ for more transparency in the family justice system as a whole			0
destroyed : the father says he was left feeling powerless and upset by the removal of his baby son the 41 - year - old husband at the centre of the case said yesterday : ‘ taking our children away destroyed my life and my wife ’s life			2
i posted the video to show how draconian the state can be even when social workers have accepted we would never have harmed our children			1
’ the father , whose comments could not be printed until the judge ’s intervention , added : ‘ hopefully if there ’s more openness in how these decisions are made it will prevent injustices			0
’ they claim social workers removed their baby because they decided the mother was incapable of bringing them up because of her learning disability			1
the couple said it was only after they had a second daughter in 2008 they came ‘ under the microscope ’			2
one social worker can be heard saying : ' we are here to take [ baby j ]			1
i do n't want to have to get physical ' harrowing : the bewildered newborn baby can be heard crying during the distressing seizure sir @entity35 said the baby 's father should not be prevented from sharing information about the case after @entity109 tried to gag him two years later , the mother was accused of pulling her elder daughter ’s hair – which she denies – and after an investigation , both girls were taken away			2
the couple had a third daughter last year , but she was taken away aged six hours , the same fate that was to befall their baby son , known only as @entity121 accompanied by police , social workers allegedly citing ‘ risk of emotional harm ’ took him away following his birth in april , unaware the father was filming on a computer webcam			1
in the video , the mother is clearly distraught as her husband remonstrates with officers and council staff at their @entity30 home			1
in june the father was given a suspended six - week prison sentence for refusing to co-operate in removing the video from internet sites			0
an edited version of it plus the parents ’ account can only now be published following sir @entity35 ’s ruling , although they still can not be named in order to protect their children , three of whom have now been adopted			2
the father said : ‘ the social workers said my wife and i were in a volatile relationship			1
there has never been violence			0
the court was told there was a risk the children would come to harm in the future			0
’ he added : ‘ the judge ’s comments are a step in the right direction , but i ’d like to see the @entity166 allowed into all family courts to stop social workers getting away with telling lies			1
’ the father said that although social workers considered his wife disabled , her disability benefits were halted after intervention by council staff , and because neither work they had to be supported by family			1
@entity30 council said it had never tried to shield itself from scrutiny			2
‘ i believe any parent in this situation should be able to tell their story , but the prime interest of the local authority is that the child has to be protected , ’ council leader @entity180 said			0
last night the @entity188 warned that encouraging aggrieved families to publicise their experiences risked ‘ demonising ’ their profession			0
chief executive @entity192 said : ‘ such images do not tell the whole story			0
if the public want children to be protected , they have to get behind social workers , understand that removal of a child is not a decision taken lightly by them alone			1
sire @entity35 told his colleagues they must learn to deal with offensive and defamatory material on the internet , rather than ‘ throw up their hands and moan ’			0
the country ’s most senior family law judge said much of what is posted online about the courts is ‘ highly objectionable ’ but the law had to adapt to it and judges must stick to the ‘ fundamentally important principles ’ of free speech			0
sir @entity35 spoke during his @entity52 ‘ @entity224 ’ ruling this week , one of the first to advise judges on how to deal with material on the web and social media			2
he said : ‘ the internet allows anyone , effectively at the click of a mouse , to publish whatever they wish			0
‘ the consequence is that the internet is awash with material couched in the most exaggerated , extreme , offensive and often defamatory terms , much of which has only a tenuous connection with objectively verifiable truth			0
‘ the law must develop and adapt , as it always has done down the years in response to other technologies			0
we must not simply throw up our hands in despair and moan that the internet is uncontrollable			0
nor can we simply abandon basic legal principles			0
