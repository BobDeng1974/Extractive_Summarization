january @entity0 eptomises the @entity2 blonde bombshell			0
but the peroxide addicted @entity4 actress recently revealed that her constantly changing hair colour has sparked every glamorous girl 's nightmare : hair loss			1
' i have been every colour and now my hair is falling out in clumps , ' the star , who is a natural light blonde , admitted			1
' i ’m going to have to shave it off and wear a wig			1
' hair crisis : while @entity18 looked her best as she walked the red carpet at the @entity21 in @entity22 on sunday , the newly blonde star has revealed her hair is falling out january , who plays icy blonde @entity25 on the hit tv series , has previously been a brunette and redhead in her acting career			1
speaking about her ever evolving hair , she told @entity33 : ' i like it all colours , it makes you feel different according to what colour it is , but i prefer to be blonde			2
' but it seems the 35 - year - old is paying the price for her luscious light locks			0
according to experts , hair loss is caused by bleaching or dyeing treatments that take place too closely together			1
the treatments strip your hair of its natural moisture and can damage the follicle leading to breakage			0
shades of red : january 's changing colour in june and october last year quick change : also in october january was a blonde , left , before turning brunette in november @entity61 , a hair colour specialist whose clients include @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 , said : ' extreme changes in hair colour can result in very damaged and over-processed hair , which is why a lot of actresses use wigs when they need to change their look for a role			1
' colour changes from brunette to blonde can be achieved safely but they are never instant – the technique and application of the colour is crucial and it needs to be a gradual process to ensure the condition of the hair is not compromised			2
' it is always essential to consult a colour specialist when considering any colour change , as they will recommend the safest way to achieve your desired result without damaging your hair or causing any hair loss			1
and it seems that january is n't alone with both @entity94 and @entity95 also reportedly suffering hair loss because of hair dye			1
damaged : january now says her constantly changing hair colour has caused it to ' fall out in clumps ' @entity95 admitted three years ago to getting bald patches after a hair colourist forgot about her in the chair			1
@entity94 , a natural brunette , has also spoken honestly about the difficulties of maintaining her platinum blonde look			2
' [ @entity106 ] must occasionally get a chemical haircut because my blonde hair is falling out , ' she told @entity110			2
' when i have a client who is forever changing their hair colour , i always make sure they 're 100 % committed to looking after it … especially when going this blond ! ' i highly recommend the @entity117 , weekly , which hydrates the hair from within			2
i also make sure that they are using less heat during the lightening process by cutting down on straightening and by using heat protection sprays and oils / ' but my top tip : avoid tying your hair up wet			0
your hair dries in its stretched state and then becomes brittle and susceptible to breakage , ' added @entity130 , @entity131 at @entity117 fellow sufferers : @entity94 and @entity95 have both admitted to suffering from hair loss like january @entity135 , celebrity hairstylist and director of @entity138 , said : ' with more options for our hair than ever , it 's hard to resist the temptation to try every new colour trend or catwalk style on offer			1
' here are his top tips ... do n’t … - get distracted when dying your @entity148 may think keeping the colour on longer will make it stronger , but it will also be stripping your hair of moisture			0
try not to get too caught up in your favourite soap – always remember to watch the clock ! - overlap the @entity157 colouring your roots be sure not to colour over areas that have been dyed before			0
dying it twice will do double the damage			0
- repeatedly use permenant dyes try using semi-permanent colours ; these will be gentler on the hair and will enhance the shine as well as improving the condition			0
- be afraid to dye your hair every 6 @entity169 sure just to focus only on the bits that need topped up e.g. the roots or grey hairs , do n’t be tempted to do the whole @entity173 …			0
- try some daily moisturising treatmentson the week running up to dying your hair try to treat your hair every day to a conditioning treatment			0
- always finish the dyeing process with a finishing treatment try @entity182 ’s @entity181 , a spray in treatment , which strengthens the hair .			0

january said : ' i have been every colour and now my hair is falling out in clumps . i *'m* going to have to shave it off and wear a wig '
