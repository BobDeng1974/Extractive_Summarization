by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 07:42 est , 3 july 2013 updated : 18:04 est , 3 july 2013 two men with @entity3 have been able to stop taking their medication after receiving bone marrow transplants			1
experts say it is too early to describe them as ‘ cured ’ – but the @entity9 virus shows no signs of returning in either patient			1
the men , who had @entity3 for about 30 years , received transplants to treat blood cancer several years ago			1
one stopped taking @entity17 drugs four months ago , while the other stopped seven weeks ago			1
both men had suffered with blood cancer and had undergone bone marrow transplants ( marrow being prepared pictured ) to treat that disease			0
no one expected the procedure to have such a dramatic and beneficial side effect their @entity28 doctors say keeping them on the drugs after their transplants first took place prevented their new supplies of healthy blood cells from becoming infected by @entity3			2
the patients ’ old , diseased cells were then attacked by the new ones			0
the @entity38 conference in @entity39 heard that now , even though the patients have stopped taking antiretroviral drugs , the virus can not be detected in their blood			1
normally , the disease can only be kept under control with lifelong treatment			0
working out why the bone marrow transplants had such a strong effect could lead to new treatments for the 34million living with @entity9			0
an estimated 100,000 @entity49 have @entity3 , including 20,000 who have not been formally diagnosed			2
@entity51 , of the @entity52 in @entity53 , said the men ‘ are doing very well ’ , but warned : ‘ while these results are exciting , they do not yet indicate the men have been cured			1
’ experts say it is too early to say that the men are cured as virus ( pictured ) could be hiding in organs one possibility is that the virus is ‘ hiding ’ in another part of the body , such as the liver or brain , and could re-emerge in the coming weeks			1
dr @entity69 of the @entity70 stressed that bone marrow transplants are ‘ complex and expensive ’ , and could be more dangerous than daily medication			0
however , he added : ‘ while this is by no means a workable cure , it does give researchers another sign - post in the direction of one			0
’ the first person reported to be cured of @entity3 , @entity28 @entity80 , underwent a stem cell transplant in 2007 to treat his leukemia			1
he was reported by his @entity84 doctors to have been cured of @entity3 two years later			1
@entity80 's doctors used a donor who had a rare genetic mutation that provides resistance against @entity3			2
so far , no one has observed similar results using ordinary donor cells such as those given to the two @entity53 patients			0
@entity95 said the patients will be put back on the drugs if there is a viral rebound			0
a rebound will show that other sites are important reservoirs of infectious virus and new approaches to measuring these reservoirs will be needed in developing a cure , @entity51 said			2
‘ these findings clearly provide important new information that might well alter the current thinking about @entity3 and gene therapy , ’ @entity107 , chief executive of @entity108 , said in a statement			0
' while stem cell transplantation is not a viable option for people with @entity3 on a broad scale because of its costs and complexity , these new cases could lead us to new approaches to treating , and ultimately even eradicating , @entity3			0

last year *scientists* *announced* that the two *unnamed* men no longer seemed to have the virus but they were still taking antiretroviral medication
the men have now come off medication - one for *15* weeks and the other for seven - and still show no signs of having @entity3 virus
experts say it is too early to say that the men had been cured but that their *progress* was very *encouraging*
warned that virus may be hiding in other organs such as the liver , spleen or brain and could return months later , he warned .
