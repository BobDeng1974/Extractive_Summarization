@entity0 is the second worst university for social mobility , a new league table claims			1
it is among elite universities judged to be poor at propelling underprivileged students into top graduate jobs			1
@entity8 , former vice-chancellor of @entity10 @entity9 , who compiled the list , said that ‘ brand value ’ was not everything			0
he called for all students to be taught job skills such as project management			0
the university is the second worst university for social mobility new research claims the rankings were labelled ‘ strange ’ by the @entity25 of 24 top universities , most of which came in the bottom half of the table			1
@entity0 came 152nd out of 153 and @entity29 was 135th , while the @entity30 in @entity31 came top			2
professor @entity8 said top universities had done badly mainly because most of their students are already from wealthy backgrounds			1
many less selective institutions are ‘ doing a remarkable and better job ’ , he said , and @entity37 policy should focus on careers as well as admissions for poorer children			0
a @entity25 spokesman said the table put a lower value on students who chose to do a phd and only looked at professional success six months after graduating			1
graduates on graduation day at @entity29 , which also came near the bottom of the league table in a report for the @entity54 liberal think - tank , professor @entity8 devised a ranking which shows how well universities help poorer students land top jobs after graduating			1
professor @entity8 said @entity25 universities ‘ do not fare well ’ , mainly because most of their students are drawn from the wealthiest social groups			1
but he also found that ‘ many “ less - selective ” universities with wider ranges of student backgrounds ’ are ‘ doing a remarkable and better job of developing their graduates into professional employment ’			0
professor @entity8 said @entity25 universities ¿ do not fare well , mainly because most of their students are drawn from the wealthiest social groups professor @entity8 said government policy had focused too narrowly on increasing the number of disadvantaged pupils getting to university in the first place , without considering how well they fare after leaving			1
these students often lacked the contacts and know - how of their middle - class peers which helped them land professional jobs			0
‘ in terms of graduation performance and employment outcomes students from areas of high disadvantage have a lower success rate than those from more advantaged backgrounds , ’ said professor @entity8			2
‘ and despite the political focus on access to @entity25 universities , the most selective institutions do not necessarily deliver the best professional graduate outcomes for disadvantaged students either			2
it is time to raise the game			0
’ he called on the government to rank universities officially using a table similar to his own			0
but dr @entity98 , director general of the @entity25 , said it rejected the findings of the report , branding its methods ‘ strange ’			2
‘ for example , it puts a lower value on graduates who decide to carry on their studies - thereby suggesting that doing a masters or getting a phd does not represent a step up the social ladder			0
‘ it fails , too , to recognise that those students from more disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to complete their degree at a @entity25 university than they are at other institutions			1
’ ‘ finally , it takes only a snapshot of graduates ’ jobs six months after they ’ve left university			0
what graduates are doing six months after graduation is not a very good indicator of how much upward mobility they will achieve over a lifetime			0
‘ in fact , graduates from @entity25 universities go on to earn more than other graduates , are more likely to be in high - skilled jobs and earn 24 per cent more per hour than their peers from other universities			2

research claims elite university are poor at helping underprivileged students into top jobs
@entity0 came second bottom of the league table for helping less wealthy students
professor behind study says most students there are already from privileged backgrounds
@entity25 spokesman said it rejected the findings
