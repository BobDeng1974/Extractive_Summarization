the 23 - year - old midfielder personifies the transformation in form at @entity7 from the start of the season when the @entity10 struggled under his fellow @entity11 who , after taking over from @entity12 in the summer , came under intense scrutiny after two chances at qualifying for the @entity17 were missed			2
@entity0 , who played under @entity3 at @entity18 before moving to the @entity20 club in january , has arguably been @entity1 's best player in recent months , playing in a more advanced role			1
@entity0 believes the @entity10 will continue to improve under @entity3 his third goal in six games before the international break helped the champions to a 2 - 1 win at @entity27 and meant the @entity10 have lost only one of their last 15 matches			1

' @entity0 does not feel under any pressure to fill the boots of @entity64 , out recently with a buttock injury , who scored 32 goals last season playing mostly in the same position behind the main striker			2
@entity0 has been arguably @entity1 's best performer so far this season speaking at the club 's @entity71 training complex , where he was helping publicise the donation by @entity74 of Â£ 50,000 to @entity75 and @entity76 , he said : ' as an attacking midfielder you do n't want to just score goals , you also want to create chances			1
