the next generation @entity0 will look something like a giant @entity0 mini , if these apparently leaked images are to be believed			2
the pictures purport to show the back - plate of of @entity7 's fifth - generation tablet which , according to recent reports , should be available for @entity9 this autumn			1
it comes as the @entity12 gadget maker officially announced the @entity14 launch of a new addition to their current @entity0 range : a new premium @entity18 model that offers double the storage of their previous top of the line tablet			0
unverified : this picture , first published by @entity7 fan site @entity25 , purports to show the backplate of the fifth - generation @entity0 , with an @entity28 backplate shown on the right for comparison the so - far unverified pictures of the ipad 5 backplate were published yesterday by @entity7 fan site @entity33 , which received them from ' a purported @entity37 - based @entity0 accessories maker '			1
it is the second @entity7 leak in as many days after speaker block components apparently from the forthcoming @entity40 and @entity41 were pictured by @entity44 tech blog @entity42			1
the source of the latest leak told @entity33 their pictures show a prototype back piece for a fifth - generation @entity0 with a 9.7in display , and that the casing is almost as thin as the same component on the ipad mini			1
a black antenna cut to the top of the plate suggests its for a model which includes 4g connectivity			0
the next @entity0 had been expected to launch this spring , but recent indications are that it will not hit the shops until october			0
that delay in its release could explain why casings are currently floating around in @entity37			0
forthcoming : the source of the leak said the pictures show a prototype back piece for a fifth - generation @entity0 with a 9.7in display , and that the casing is almost as thin as the same component on the ipad mini in the meantime , @entity7 today announced that a new @entity18 model of its current - generation @entity0 will be available in the @entity14 and @entity73 from next week - just in time to take on the pro version of @entity76 's surface tablet			1
it will join the @entity77 , @entity78 , and @entity79 fourth - generation @entity0 which @entity7 already has on the market and comes after @entity76 last week announced it was to market a pro version of its surface tablet in @entity83 from next week			1
@entity7 will release a @entity18 version of the @entity0 next week , just in time to take on the latest top - of - the - line pro version of @entity76 's surface tablet			1
the forthcoming fourth - generation @entity7 tablet with a @entity87 will not be a redesign of current models but rather an addition to the current line			1
it will join the @entity77 , @entity78 , and @entity79 fourth - generation @entity0 which @entity7 already has on the market			1
it will cost £ 639 for the @entity95 model and £ 739 for the mobile internet - enabled version when it goes on sale through @entity7 shops and authorised resellers on february 5			2
it comes after @entity76 last week announced it was to market a pro version of its surface tablet in @entity83 from next week			0
powered by an @entity105 x86 - type processor , the @entity103 will run a full version of the latest @entity107 , allowing it to use fully featured @entity109 software rather than the slimmed - down apps currently available for @entity111 that has allowed @entity76 to position the gadget as a complete laptop replacement			0
it comes in both @entity79 and @entity18 versions but , unlike @entity7 's tablets , does not have a sim slot to enable connection to mobile networks			1
@entity7 has pitched the new premium model of the @entity0 squarely at the corporate market , pointing out in a release that 85 per cent of the world 's top 500 companies are currently deploying or testing the machine			2
' companies regularly utilising large amounts of data such as @entity131 files , x-rays , film edits , music tracks , project blueprints , training videos and service manuals all benefit from having a greater choice of storage options for @entity0 , ' a spokesman said			0
' the over 10 million @entity142 users , and customers who rely on other incredible apps like @entity145 for analysing team film and creating digital playbooks , @entity148 for an incredible 48 track recording system , or @entity150 for drafting architectural and engineering drawings , also benefit greatly from having the choice of an @entity0 with more storage capacity			0
' like its more modest peers in the @entity0 range , the @entity157 comes equipped with a .7 - inch retina display , @entity7 - designed @entity160 chip , @entity162 camera , @entity163 6.1 , @entity95 and optional @entity165 mobile internet			2
it will cost £ 639 for the @entity95 model and £ 739 for the mobile internet - enabled version when it goes on sale through @entity7 shops and authorised resellers on february 5			2
the appearance of the @entity0 backplate pictures is the second purported leak in as many days of components expected to be used in forthcoming @entity7 products			1
yesterday @entity177 reported how images of what is believed to be parts of the forthcoming @entity41 have emerged online for the first time			1
is this the first look at the next iphones ? the image purporting to show the speaker parts from the forthcoming @entity40 and @entity41 6			0
the same part from the current generation is shown not to scale the photos , which the editor of @entity44 tech blog @entity189 said he found ' while browsing the web ' , show speaker components which are similar to ones used in the @entity195			0
they were apparently leaked online by an employee of the @entity199 company which manufactures the parts for the @entity12 tech giant			0
both parts appear to be similar in design to the part currently used in @entity40 , but the one thought to be for the @entity41 is slightly smaller			0
it is speculated that this could actually be designed for the as - yet hypothetical @entity208 , an @entity209 or a possible budget iphone			0
the writer claimed the source of the images , whose identity he chose to keep secret , told him the @entity40 is set for launch between march and july , while the @entity41 will be unveiled at the year 's end .			2
