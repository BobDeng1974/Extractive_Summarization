@entity0 has become the latest company to remove thousands of beef burgers from its restaurants over fears they may be contaminated with horse meat as its supplier suspends operations			1
the firm at the centre of the horse meat scandal - @entity11 company @entity10 - has failed to give the @entity14 hotel chain assurances that their stock has not been contaminated			1
it comes as burger supplier announced a temporary closure at its @entity20 processing plant in @entity21 after new tests confirmed the contamination was rife			2
we asked our supplier , @entity20 , to give us assurances that the beefburger product supplied to us was not affected by this issue			0
' after they initially gave us this assurance they have subsequently told us they can not now give us this guarantee			0
as a precautionary measure , we therefore immediately took the decision to remove their products from our menus			0
' as we use two beefburger suppliers we have been able to quickly replace all our @entity20 stock through our alternative provider			0
' @entity10 said fresh tests from burgers produced in the last two weeks confirmed a @entity57 processing company – believed to be in @entity58 or the @entity59 – as the source of contamination			1
the unnamed company supplied a meat bulking protein powder that was used in burgers made for supermarkets in @entity14 and @entity11			1
@entity10 also used the ingredient in the @entity68 factory run by its @entity70 subsidiary			1
burger : more than ten million burgers have been removed from sale , including more than 100,000 made at the @entity68 factory of @entity70 empty shelves : @entity29 has taken its frozen burgers off the shelves as some contained 29 per cent horse meat last night the company said : ‘ to date , @entity81 investigations have centred around two third party @entity83 suppliers			1
' following receipt of this evening ’s @entity11 @entity87 results , we believe that we have established the source of the contaminated material to one of these suppliers			0
' however , because equine dna has been found in finished products tested this week , we have decided that the responsible course of action is to suspend all production at the @entity20 plant in @entity21 with immediate effect			0
' this week ’s production has not been released from the plant			0
’ the company also supplies @entity101 but last night insisted there was no chance of the fast food chain 's products being contaminated as they are made and stored separately at the plant			1
it said : ' we would like to reiterate that all @entity101 products produced by us are stored separately and manufactured on an independent line			0
cover - up ? the @entity110 is in charge of handling @entity14 's response to the scandal			1
however , the official watchdog has made efforts to limit the scope of its investigation bare : the frozen burger section of this @entity119 's in @entity120 stands empty today after the chain became one of many to pull its products there is no evidence of any contamination of raw material used for the manufacture of any @entity101 products			1
' @entity11 agriculture minister @entity131 said an investigation will continue to establish conclusively the source of the equine dna			2
in @entity14 , watchdogs are under pressure to test all supermarket frozen beefburgers for the presence of horse meat amid fears of an official cover - up			2
the demand came after it emerged that a raft of big brand burgers and grills sold under the @entity148 , @entity70 , @entity149 and @entity150 names are being withdrawn			2
more than ten million burgers have been removed from sale , including more than 100,000 made at the @entity68 factory of @entity70 , which supplied @entity155			1
@entity156 says comprehensive food tests are needed to let families know how far horse meat contamination has spread into the food supply			2
the government has put the @entity110 ( @entity110 ) in charge of handling @entity14 ’s response to the scandal , which was uncovered in @entity11			1
however , the official watchdog has made efforts to limit the scope of its investigation			1
not for sale : @entity29 in @entity170 had removed all its own brand burgers from sale the manufacturers involved also made cheap frozen burgers for @entity174 ( pictured ) , @entity119 's , and the co-op among others @entity155 has revealed that its frozen burgers contaminated with horse dna will be converted into fuel			1
the supermarket has so far withdrawn more than 2,000 units following the @entity183 ’s damning report			0
@entity155 said useful organic materials from the waste animal tissue would be released through a ‘ rendering ’ process and converted into fuel			2
@entity119 ’s has also removed one line from its shelves , although it was not implicated in the report			0
but a spokeswoman ensured that the meat would not go to waste , saying : ‘ the products withdrawn from stores will be sent to anaerobic digestion plants			0
‘ this is the most efficient method of generating energy from waste , and part of our broader ‘ zero food waste to landfill ’ strategy			1
we are the @entity14 ’s largest retail user of anaerobic digestion			2
’ as a result , families may never know the full extent of the contamination of burgers and other beef ready meals using suspect ingredients			1
@entity29 and @entity155 have been selling burgers in the @entity14 that came from batches found to be contaminated with horse meat in tests by the @entity183			2
supermarket giant @entity29 has placed full - page adverts in a number of national newspapers apologising to customers for selling beefburgers containing horsemeat			0
@entity225 , @entity20 and @entity155 have also withdrawn frozen beefburgers from their shelves after they were found to be contaminated with horsemeat			0
although manufacturers @entity20 and @entity70 also made cheap frozen burgers for other retailers such as @entity174 , @entity119 ’s and the co-op , @entity14 ’s @entity110 said yesterday morning that it had no intention of testing the burgers of these other stores , which were on shelves until they were withdrawn earlier this week			1
even so , @entity119 's , @entity174 and the co-op have withdrawn some frozen products but stressed that the move was ' purely precautionary ' and they had not been found to be selling contaminated food			0
@entity110 officials said there was no food safety risk and , therefore , no reason to test			2
later , however , it said : ‘ if the @entity110 investigations being undertaken at the moment reveal that we need to look at additional food products then we will not hesitate to take action which may include further testing			1
’ meanwhile , farming leaders called today for immediate action by @entity14 supermarkets to improve their sourcing and labelling of food in the wake of the horse meat burger scandal			1
@entity262 president @entity261 said the integrity of @entity14 - produced meat was being compromised by the use of cheaper imports which did not meet the same stringent monitoring systems			1
he said retailers must take immediate action to address the integrity of their suppliers and ensure that @entity14 products are easily distinguishable and clearly labelled , so customers can make a conscious decision on the food they buy			0
mr @entity261 added : ' the events of the past few days have severely undermined confidence in the @entity14 food industry and farmers are rightly angry that the integrity of stringent @entity14 - farmed products is being compromised by using cheaper imported alternatives which , evidence suggests , do not meet the robust traceability systems we have in the @entity14			2
' he said farmers were also concerned that the high standards and traceability they have to meet are not being upheld throughout the supply chain			0
' what is particularly concerning is that this revelation comes at a time when farmers are under enormous pressures and consumer confidence is low			0
' retailers will know they must take immediate action to address both the integrity of all their suppliers , and at the same time ensure that @entity14 products are easily distinguishable and clearly labelled			0
' we need to move this debate on to find lasting solutions by putting an end to co-mingled products which mix @entity14 meat with imported meat , as well as clearer labelling of all ingredients in products to ensure consumers can make a conscious buying decision			0
" he also urged retailers to work more closely with the @entity315 assurance scheme , which ensures products are @entity14 and have met certain standards , increase the scheme 's logo on packs and focus on the long - term sustainability of the @entity14 supply chain			1
