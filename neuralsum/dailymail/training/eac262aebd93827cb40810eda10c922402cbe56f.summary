by @entity0 published : 23:14 est , 4 august 2013 updated : 14:11 est , 5 august 2013 barring an unfortunate lightning strike , it looks like @entity3 was right - he will be in the @entity5 ’ lineup monday night			1
despite multiple reports claiming to confirm @entity7 will announce on monday a 214 game suspension – along with 50 game bans for as many as 15 others – of the tarnished player , @entity3 will be able to play monday night			1
the accused cheater ’s plan to appeal the suspension allows for him to be on the field until an arbitrator hears the case			2
despite openly defying the league and practically daring @entity7 commissioner @entity19 to ban him for life , @entity3 is able to appeal because of how the suspension is being handed down			1
by suspending the slugger , who boasted on friday that he ’d play for the @entity5 monday unless he was ‘ struck by lightning , ’ in that manner , @entity19 enables @entity3 to appeal to an arbitrator under the guidelines of drug testing regime agreed to between the league and the player ’s union			1
a lifetime ban is no longer being considered , according to @entity42 ’ @entity43			0
per the @entity44 , @entity3 can don the pinstripes until a decision is reached by an arbitrator , allowing him to play monday night and into the immediate future , at the very least			1
the @entity5 have no choice but to activate the aging slugger if he is ready to play			0
the teams of all players involved have been notified of their suspensions , according to the @entity54			0
almost all of the players are expected to accept the suspensions without appeal , the league also notified @entity5 that @entity3 will appeal the suspension , the paper noted			1
should an arbitrator side with the league and uphold the suspension in full , it would likely carry into the 2015 season , a risk @entity3 appears willing to take			1
defiant till the bitter end : @entity3 boasted friday night that he was going to play for the @entity5 monday unless ' struck by lightning ' something on his mind ? : @entity3 looks like he has the weight of the world on his shoulders in this photo from the 2009 season originally reported to be 12 players , including a few minor leaguers , the total suspended is now expected to be 15 , @entity43 originally reported sunday afternoon			1
it is not known who the three additional players are – but they will not be @entity82 ’s pitcher @entity81 , @entity84 outfielder @entity83 or @entity86 catcher @entity85 since they were suspended last year for use of performance enhancing drugs			1
in taking his case to an arbitrator , @entity3 , 38 , will likely try to throw the @entity5 – a team that will have paid him over $ 275million by the end of this season – under a bus for a host of reasons			1
@entity3 plans to accuse team doctors of misdiagnosing injuries and the @entity5 of mishandling injuries of his as far back as 2009 – which forced him to seek alternatives that would put him back on the field , according to the @entity54			1
an a-bomb ! from @entity3 : @entity3 watches his towering home run sail over the fence friday night chicks dig the long ball : at least one fan was happy to see @entity3 during his final rehab game saturday for the @entity111 the long - fading star may also point to the fact that the longest suspension served for a @entity116 - related offense since the drug testing program went into effect in 2005 was 100 games after @entity122 ’ pitcher @entity121 ’s second positive test			1
@entity3 has never tested positive for @entity123			2
despite the level of vitriol directed at the team , manager @entity124 told reporters in @entity129 sunday that he has the accused steroid cheat ‘ penciled in ’ for monday			2
‘ he 's in there , and i 'm going to play him , " @entity5 manager @entity124 said after @entity54 's 6 - 3 loss at @entity129			2
’ the three - time mvp brazenly declared saturday that he ’d be flying to @entity136 to join the team for monday ’s game , but there are still doubts @entity3 can play third base on an everyday basis after 20 years in the @entity142 , especially coming off his second hip surgery			1
better times : @entity3 celebrates as the @entity5 clinch the @entity145 , his only championship the honeymoon ended quickly : what started out so promising , quickly became acrimonious as @entity3 's personal life soon became a major distraction for the team @entity3 only played a full nine innings once during his most recent rehab stint at @entity155 @entity154 , and had very few chances in the field			2
he did hit a two - run home run friday night , in addition to cleanly fielding the only two chances he had at third , but he only played five innings			0
the 14 - time all - star walked in all four of his plate appearances during his final minor league game saturday night			2
shortly after hitting the home run , @entity3 went rogue during a post-game news conference			0
the alleged cheat accused both the @entity5 and @entity7 of conspiring to keep him off the field and void his contract			0
‘ there is more than one party that benefits from me not ever stepping back on the field			0
and that 's not my teammates and it 's not the @entity5 fans , ’ the tormented slugger said , adding , ‘ when all this stuff is going on in the background and people are finding creative ways to cancel your contract and stuff like that , i think that 's concerning for me			0
’ not everyone is convinced : a fan holds a sign that reads " @entity192 , " while @entity3 signs autographs before a friday rehab game for @entity155 @entity154 been there , done that : fans have been holding up signs labeling the beleaguered player a cheater for years , this sign is being held up by a fan in @entity201 during the 2009 @entity202 though teammates have supported the paranoid pariah ’s return to the team while on the record , many reports have them saying off the record that he will be an unnecessary distraction , something @entity124 publicly disagreed with			1
‘ i do n't suspect it 'll be awkward			0
most of these guys know him as a teammate and have laughed a lot with @entity3 and been around @entity3 a lot , ’ he said			0
‘ i think it 'll be business as usual			0
i 'm sure there will be more media there , obviously , tomorrow , but i think that 's probably more for @entity3 to deal with than the rest of the guys			0
i do n't think it 'll be a big deal			0
’ big deal or not , @entity3 was right , all signs point to him being in the road greys monday night against the @entity230 , unless he is struck by lightning			2
wonder what he was thinking : @entity3 stares at the ball he hit for his 600th home run in august , 2010			0

a 214 game suspension against @entity3 is expected to be announced - along with other , lesser bans - monday afternoon
@entity3 is *widely* expected to appeal the suspension , clearing the way for him to play until his case is heard by an arbitrator
@entity3 may blame the team for his use of performance enhancing drugs , saying they mishandled and misdiagnosed injuries since 2009
should the arbitrator side with the league , his suspension could continue into the 2015 season if upheld in its *entirety*
