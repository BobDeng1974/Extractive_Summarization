secretary of defense @entity0 found himself on the receiving end of diatribe from a @entity5 lawmaker on thursday afternoon over the @entity8 administration 's plan to arm and train moderate @entity10 rebels as part of its strategy to defeat the @entity13			1
@entity15 rep. @entity14 harangued @entity16 at a @entity18 hearing for not offering @entity20 documentation on which @entity10 it plans to give weapons to and how it will prevent @entity24 extremists from confiscating those arms			1
' i do n't think that the plan that i have seen was detailed enough to make me believe that your plan will work , ' she told @entity16			1
' i 'm not so sure of it , and i have n't heard the details as i 'd like to hear them , ' she said moments later			0
the congresswoman , @entity15 rep. @entity14 , demanded to know detailed information about the administration 's plan to arm moderate @entity10 rebels a @entity18 - passed resolution calls for the @entity44 government to give weapons to ' appropriately vetted ' members of the @entity10 opposition of both @entity48 and @entity10 president @entity49			1
the plan , approved yesterday in the lower chamber by a vote of 273 - 156 as an amendment to legislation that would fund the federal government through december , stipulates that the @entity8 administration can arm the rebels , but it must give @entity20 an outline of it 's intended actions before it can commence the program			1
ahead of the vote , @entity62 war veteran and @entity63 blasted the notion of arming @entity10 rebels as ' unrealistic ' and warned that @entity8 and his advisers were on track to repeat the previous administration 's mistakes in @entity62			2
' we ’ve heard this story before			0
we know how it ends			0
look at @entity76 , ' @entity74 , who is also a @entity75 , said			0
' clearly , our leaders have not learned their lesson			0
we must focus on taking out our enemies and investing in our own country here at home , ' she continued			0
another @entity62 veteran , @entity15 rep. @entity83 , a @entity84 who also fought in @entity86 , said he no longer had ' confidence we are arming the right people			1
' ' we do n't know how moderate these @entity10 rebels really are , ' @entity14 chimed in on the @entity18 floor wednesday			1
' in fact , some of my @entity10 constituents , @entity10 @entity44 who live in @entity91 , have told me that there are no moderates left or , worse , that the moderates , given the choice between losing or @entity49 or @entity48 , want @entity48 , and they say people are n't going to fight against @entity48 , ' she claimed			1
' we do n't know if somewhere down the line they will turn our guns right back on us			0
' in fact , that is one of the scarier things that we have to face , ' she added			0
' we simply do n't know who we can trust			0
in an uncontrolled , war - torn destabilized country , who do we trust ? ' @entity14 , @entity74 and @entity83 were among the lawmakers who voted against the amendment			2
a demonstrator is removed from @entity18 hearing after interrupting @entity16 as he testified about the @entity44 response to the ongoing threat from the @entity13			1
@entity16 was in the middle of his opening statement when two protesters , one of whom is not pictured , sought to steal the spotlight in today 's @entity18 hearing featuring testimony from @entity16 , @entity14 restated her concerns that the arms the @entity44 provides to the so - called moderate @entity10 rebels may fall into the hands of the @entity24 radicals the @entity8 administration has promised to ' degrade and destroy			1
' contending that it 's ' pretty disturbing ' this afternoon 's hearing with @entity16 happened after the vote to authorize the weapons program , @entity14 said her @entity10 constituents have informed her that ' @entity10 moderates have gone over to @entity48			1
' ' and most of them have told me that they do n't think that the @entity10 moderates we arm , whoever those may be , are actually going to fight against the @entity48 moderates who used to hang out with the @entity10 moderates , ' she said			2
pointing to war in @entity62 - which she also voted against - as an example , she argued that the @entity44 spent $ 35 billion on equipment and training for the @entity62 , yet @entity48 managed rise up and take over large parts of the country anyway			1
after indirectly referencing her @entity84 colleagues on the committee , @entity14 said that ' some have said was n't a problem of equip and train , it was a lack of leadership , it was bad people commanding , it was the commander in chief , [ former @entity62 prime minister @entity157 ] who was wrong and did n't help us on this or did n't make this thing work , ' she said			1
' can you tell me who the commander in chief of the @entity10 moderates - who are all over the place , do n't even talk to each other sometimes - how we 're gon na see that leadership ? ' she asked			0
' what type of arms , exactly , what type of arms , are we going to hand over to these people ? because the last time i checked , we handed over arms to @entity157 and they ended up in @entity48 and the very safe arms are going after us			1
' @entity16 had said in his opening statement that the @entity44 would give the rebels small arms , vehicles , and basic communications equipment in addition to providing them with tactical training			1
as they prove themselves , he said , the @entity44 military will provide them with more sophisticated training			0
repeating testimony he gave to a @entity193 panel on tuesday , @entity16 promised that the @entity10 rebels accepted into the program would go through a ' rigorous vetting process ' and that the @entity197 would work hand - in - hand with the @entity199 to ' monitor them closely ' to make sure that the weapons are not transferred to @entity48			1
' there will always be risk in a program like this , but we believe that risk is justified by the imperative of destroying @entity48 – and the necessity of having capable partners on the ground in @entity10 , ' he said on tuesday and in similar testimony again today			1
rep. @entity14 , pictured here at a @entity215 hearing in june , is known for her intense questioning style in committee hearings			2
today she blasted secretary of defense hagel for encouraging @entity20 to authorize a plan she fears will have an adverse effect in the fight against @entity48 during her dressing down of @entity16 , @entity14 also tore into the @entity8 administration over its claims that an international coalition of 40 countries are standing with the @entity44 against @entity48			1
' who ? what will they really do ? how many troops ? ' she demanded to know of the @entity197 head , noting several times along the way that he could provide this information to her privately if necessary			0
the administration has repeatedly stated that the @entity44 has the backing of dozens of other countries in the fight against @entity48 but has refused to name names in most cases			2
' i 've been through this , you guys , ' @entity14 told her colleagues today			2
' i saw the coalition in @entity62 , and we used to sort of , like , chuckle at each other , ' she said , explaining that some countries provided just one person do things like ' training dogs			2
' as her time to question @entity16 expired - before the @entity8 administration official could answer her questions - @entity14 clarified that she wants the president 's strategy to take out @entity48 to prove successful , though she fears it wo n't			1
' i hope your plan works , because you know , @entity48 , @entity48 , they 're not good , ' she said			2
' i hope i am wrong			0
i hoped the same thing when i voted against the @entity62 war , that i was wrong , but i do n't believe that i was wrong on that , ' she added			2
secretary of state @entity267 has promised to reveal the names of the international coalition frequently referred to by the administration in the immediate future			0
' later this week we will have more to say about our partners and the coalition , ' he told a @entity193 panel on wednesday			0
' not every country will decide that their role is to have military engagement , but every country can do something , ' the @entity276 said without going into further detail			0
members of the committee , which oversees foreign affairs , were unimpressed			0
' typically you have a coalition in place before you announce it , ' @entity287 sen. @entity287 told his former colleague			0
' in this case we have announced one and are attempting to put it together			0
' do you realize how unserious the things you are laying out sound ? ' @entity287 asked the country 's top diplomat .			0

congressman @entity14 lit into the secretary of defense for not providing a *blueprint* of the weapons and training program to @entity20
the @entity18 authorized the plan yesterday despite not having had a look at the fine print
' what type of arms *...* are we going to hand over to these people ? ' @entity14 asked @entity16 during a hearing today
' we handed over arms to [ the @entity62 government ] and they ended up in @entity48 and the very safe arms are going after us , ' she added
