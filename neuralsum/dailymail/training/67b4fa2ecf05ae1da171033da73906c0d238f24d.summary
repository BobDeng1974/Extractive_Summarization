@entity0 , the mother of a toddler killed by her 21 - year - old boyfriend while she celebrated her birthday in @entity4 was interviewed on this morning today @entity0 thought she was leaving her 23 - month - old daughter @entity5 in safe hands when she left for a three day trip to @entity4 in march last year			1
but , only 24 hours into the holiday , @entity0 received a call from her boyfriend @entity10 explaining that her daughter was on her way to hospital after accidentally falling and banging her head			1
in fact , within hours of @entity0 's departure , @entity10 had beaten toddler @entity5 so badly that she died from devastating brain injuries the next day			1
an investigation revealed she was either pushed or fell down the stairs and tests showed she was punched , slapped and subjected to ‘ vigorous shaking ’ before she died			1
@entity10 was jailed for life in may this year and today @entity0 , who is now expecting a baby with a new partner , spoke for the first time about her ordeal			1
she explained to this morning hosts @entity28 and @entity29 : ' it was the worst feeling in the world , we got the first flight home			2
when i arrived at the hospital she was on a life support machine , she was wearing a neck brace , bruised and full of tubes			0
' not long after the doctor pulled me to one side and said they had tried everything and there was no chance of survival			0
' @entity10 was arrested several days after @entity5 's death , but @entity0 admitted that she was surprised because she still believed that her daughter had hurt herself by tumbling in @entity46 's			1
she said : ' i did n't think he would have done anything to her			0
' @entity48 ( right ) died from devastating brain injuries @entity0 and @entity10 had been together for four months before she left him in charge of her daughter to take that fateful trip			1
at the start of their relationship she admits she was very happy and grateful to have him around : ' he came across as a very charming man , everything i was looking for			0
i wanted somebody in my life because i was a single mum			2
i was grateful to have him around as he was so nice and loving			0
' originally @entity5 was due to stay with her grandmother while @entity0 visited @entity4 to celebrate her 21st birthday with her father , but @entity10 persuaded her to leave the child with him at their shared home in @entity69 because he wanted to ‘ bond ’ with her			1
defenceless : @entity10 had said he wanted to ' bond ' with @entity5 @entity0 , now 22 , told the jury who convicted @entity10 : ' i trusted him and did n’t think he would cause any harm to her			1
i thought they would have bonded , they would have got on , not that anything like this would have happened			0
' but in the early hours of march 10 , @entity10 rang 999 and told the operator : ' my baby ’s fell down the stairs			1
i ca n’t really hear breathing			0
' inquiries revealed in the hours before @entity5 was taken to hospital that @entity86 posted a photo of @entity5 on @entity88 , with a caption saying she had hit her head on a door at @entity92			2
but the day after she died , he edited the caption on the picture to read , ‘ aah my little princess when she banged her head on the floor ’			2
on this morning @entity0 admitted that @entity10 had displayed some controlling and violent behaviour towards her and @entity5 before the trip , but claimed that she was so brainwashed into thinking that she needed him that she ignored it			1
she said : ' there were a few occasions when he held her upside down by her legs and we would argue about it but he threatened to leave			0
( @entity108 ) grew less comfortable around him but i thought it was down to jealousy			0
' at the start he was a really nice lad but towards the end he was horrible , very controlling , he stopped me me seeing my friends and family			0
i did n't see the signs though , i was brainwashed			0
i thought i needed him			0
' @entity10 has never admitted guilt , maintaining that the child ’s injuries were caused by an accidental fall down the stairs at the house he shared with @entity5 and her mother in @entity69			1
he said : ' @entity5 called me daddy the first day i met her - i had a bond with @entity108 , we were so close - i thought @entity0 was the one			1
' jailed : @entity10 has been sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum of 18 years but @entity125 from @entity126 said in may : ' @entity5 was a two - year - old little girl who should have felt safe in her own home in the care of @entity129			1
he abused his position of trust and subjected an innocent toddler to an attack which left her with an unsurvivable head injury			2
' we will never know exactly what happened on that day , as @entity86 has always maintained that it was an accident			0
@entity5 ’s family are devastated by @entity10 ’s actions and will never be able to see [ her ] grow up into a young woman , see her get married and have children of her own			1
' he has now been jailed , and will have to live the rest of his life with the knowledge that he is responsible for killing @entity5			2
' @entity0 is devastated that he has never shown any remorse and is desperate to know why he killed her little girl			2
she said : ' he denied everything			0
he did n't show any remorse			0
i do n't know what happened that night and it tears me apart day and night that i do n't know what happened to my daughter			0
