the mission to produce the world ’s first 1,000mph car has been given a boost - or more accurately thrust - with the installation of a state - of - the - art jet engine			1
a team of five engineers spent eight hours fitting the @entity10 engine to the upper and lower chassis of the supersonic @entity13 car			1
driver @entity14 , 51 , is hoping to break the world land speed record when he tests the £ 10 million rocket - powered vehicle next year			1
the mission to produce the world ’s first 1,000mph ( 1,600km/h ) car has been given a boost - or more accurately thrust - with the installation of a state - of - the - art jet engine			1
a team of five engineers spent eight hours fitting the @entity10 jet engine to the upper and lower chassis of the supersonic @entity13 car ( pictured ) the engine , which is normally found powering a @entity25 , weighs a tonne and produces 20,000lbs ( @entity27 ) - or nine tonnes of thrust			1
it was fitted at the bloodhound technical centre in @entity31 , near @entity32			0
the upper chassis is made of strong , but lightweight aluminium , onto which titanium stringers and titanium skin will be fixed using glue and 1,400 aircraft specification rivets			2
the @entity13 stands for ‘ @entity40 ’			2
the vehicle has four wheels and is powered by both the newly - fitted jet engine and a rocket			2
it is set to travel at 1,000mph ( 1,600km/h )			2
the slender body , 44 feet ( 14 metres ) long , keeps the entire vehicle aerodynamic			0
it weighs just over seven tonnes and the engines will produce more than 135,000 horsepower			2
that ’s more than six times the power of all the cars on a formula 1 starting grid put together			0
in the coming years the vehicle will begin test runs at lower speeds before attempting to set a new land speed record			1
the current land speed record stands at 763.035mph ( 1,227.985km/h ) , set by former @entity59 pilot @entity14 - who will also drive the bloodhound - back in 1997 in the @entity62			1
the @entity13 will beat this record by some distance if it is successful			1
the lower chassis , below the jet , is made of aluminium and steel , and houses the @entity71 hybrid rocket			1
the two power plants together produce 135,000 thrust horse power , or the equivalent to 180 @entity76 cars			0
the pencil - shaped car will be 44ft ( 13.4m ) long , 6ft ( 183cm ) in diameter , and weigh 7.5 tonnes when completed			1
chief engineer @entity79 said : ‘ this is a fantastic moment in the project			0
‘ it ’s great to see the jet engine fitted , it validates the many years of hard work by our team of motor sport and aerospace engineers			2
’ the project is on course for the finished car to roll out for low speed testing at up to 200mph ( 321km/h ) at @entity95 ’s @entity94 next summer			0
the team will then head to @entity98 and attempt to break the 1,000mph barrier on a purpose - built 12 - mile track in the desert in 2015 and 2016			1
during the record - chasing run , @entity13 will cover 12 miles ( 19km ) in two minutes , exerting an acceleration force of almost @entity104 , and peak deceleration force of @entity106 on the driver			1
the current land speed record stands at 763.035mph ( 1,227.985km/h ) , set by former @entity59 pilot @entity14 - who will also drive the bloodhound - back in 1997 in the @entity62			1
the pencil - shaped car ( concept pictured ) will be 44ft ( 13.4m ) long , 6ft ( 183cm ) in diameter and weigh 7.5 tonnes when completed			1
the upper chassis is made of strong , but lightweight aluminium to which titanium stringers and titanium skin will be fixed using glue and 1,400 aircraft specification rivets the lower chassis , below the jet ( pictured ) , is made of aluminium and steel , and houses the @entity71 hybrid rocket			1
the two power plants together produce 135,000 thrust horse power , or the equivalent to 180 f1 cars earlier this year , designers of the supersonic car revealed the vehicle ’s futuristic cockpit			1
it has been made from five different types of carbon fibre weave , and two different resins			0
it has taken more than 10,000 hours to design and manufacture in total			0
the team behind the @entity13 also revealed how they intend to slow it from 1,000mph ( 1,600km/h ) to zero			1
after the car reaches its top speed , air brakes and parachutes slow it to 160mph ( 260km/h )			0
breaking to this speed is done at a constant @entity149 - equivalent to going from 60mph ( 95km/h ) in a normal car to zero in just one second - for 20 seconds			0
at this speed the cars wheels are still spinning 10,000 times per minute			0
attempts to use carbon rotors from a jet fighter in the form of car - like disc brakes shattered at speeds of just half this , so the team needed a new approach			2
instead , they switched to steel rotors			0
in tests , these could withstand temperatures of up to 850 ° c ( 1,560 ° f ) , and be used again			0
the next step will be to test these brakes out at the full 10,000rpm that will be experienced			0
sandwiched between the layers of carbon fibre are three different thicknesses of aluminium honeycomb core , which provide additional strength			0
at its thickest point the material is made up of 13 layers , but measures just 0.9 - inches ( 24mm ) thick			0
the cockpit structure weighs 441lbs ( 200kg ) and bolts directly to the metallic rear chassis carrying the jet , rocket and racing car engine			1
it has to be strong as this front section will have to endure peak aerodynamic loads of up to three tonnes per square metre at 1,000mph ( 1,609kph ) , as well the considerable forces generated by the front wheels and suspension			2
it will also carry ballistic armour to protect wing commander @entity14 should a stone be thrown up by the front wheels at very high speeds			1
the cockpit is positioned in front of three loud motors - the jet , a cluster of hybrid rockets and the racing car engine that drives the rocket ’s oxidiser pump , which are expected to generate a noise level estimated at 140 decibels - the equivalent to a shotgun blast			2
wing commander @entity14 will wear a specially made in - ear communications system to protect his hearing and to ensure that he can communicate with mission control			2
the team behind the @entity13 also revealed how they intend to slow it from 1,000mph ( 1,600km/h ) to zero			1

the first attempt to break the 1,000mph barrier will take place in @entity98 on a purpose - built 12 - mile track in the desert in 2015 and 2016 the engine was fitted at the at the bloodhound technical centre in @entity31 , near @entity32 ( pictured )			1

this last stint to zero is where the problem lies , however			0
