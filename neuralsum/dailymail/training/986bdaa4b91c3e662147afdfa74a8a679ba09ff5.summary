@entity0 is ready to sign his new mega deal at @entity2 - so it 's little wonder he was all smiles at training on friday morning before catching the train to @entity8 for saturday 's game with @entity10			1
the striker will pen a five - and - a - half - year contract at @entity13 , which should keep him at the club for the remainder of his career			1

in re-signing , he presents a major coup for @entity22			0
it had looked as if the 28 - year - old would be leaving for pastures new last summer , with @entity59 keen to land the @entity43 man			1

they 've only won one of the last five league games , including an embarrassing 2 - 1 defeat at @entity97			0
the alarming slump - that had looked like picking up before @entity99 - has n't stopped @entity71 being a hive of joviality though ; the news of @entity0 's impending contract can only have boosted morale			1
@entity86 , @entity85 and @entity80 were all snapped sharing a joke as @entity22 attempts to relieve the sort of mounting pressure which looks to have derailed their campaign			0
