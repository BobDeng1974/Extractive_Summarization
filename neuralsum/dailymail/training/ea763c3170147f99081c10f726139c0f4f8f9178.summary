@entity1 boss @entity0 believes @entity2 has been a ' fantastic ' chairman for @entity3 and claims @entity4 would have been sacked by now under a foreign owner			1
@entity2 has endured a turbulent relationship with @entity3 supporters , who have criticised the billionaire 's off - field appointments , the renaming of @entity11 and a lack of investment in new players since he bought the club in 2007			1
the @entity17 owner also remained loyal to @entity4 during a difficult start to the season and the manager has repaid his chairman 's faith , leading the @entity23 to five consecutive victories			1
@entity2 has been a ' fantastic ' chairman for @entity3 , claims @entity1 boss @entity0 @entity0 is set to take his side to face @entity3 at @entity11 on saturday ' the chairman has been fantastic , ' said @entity0 , whose @entity1 side play @entity3 on saturday			1
' he gets a lot of stick , @entity2 , but he 's always at the games in the crowd			2
' he follows the team , loves it , and has stuck by @entity4 because he knows he 's got a good manager			2
' it 's easy to make a knee - jerk reaction and bomb him out			0
' they finished fifth the other year and were very unlucky not to finish in the @entity37 places - he 's done a good job			0
' many @entity3 supporters called for @entity4 to be sacked after a miserable start to the campaign but wins over @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 have transformed the mood in the north - east			1
@entity4 was handed an eight - year contract in december 2012 but @entity0 insists the long - term deal will not be the reason behind @entity2 's loyalty			1
' it does n't really matter if you 've got a contract - there will be a clause in it and 99 times out of 100 , if they sack you that will probably pay you a year 's money , ' @entity0 said			2
@entity4 would have been sacked by now by a foreign owner , according to @entity0 ' the difference is probably because he 's a @entity63 owner			1
' lots of the foreign owners would look at bringing a foreign manager in because maybe he 's been a better player than @entity4 was and they played in @entity68 or @entity69			2
' but @entity2 has stuck by him and no matter what abuse he gets he does n't care , does he ? ' that 's why he 's such a clever man - you do n't become that wealthy if you 're not a clever man			0
' @entity0 turned down the chance to become @entity3 manager in 2008 , opting instead to remain at @entity76 , where he won the @entity77 later that year			1
' i was offered the job but i just could n't get my @entity81 accent right , ' @entity0 joked			0
' no i do n't regret anything , i do n't look back , i look forward and move on			0
' i went to @entity42 and had four fantastic years and i do n't regret staying at @entity76 where i had a great time			0
' and i do n't regret being here , i have loved it here			0
i 'm very lucky to keep going			0
