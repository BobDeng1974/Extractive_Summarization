by @entity0 the first time a child says ' @entity3 ' or ' @entity4 ' is the most cherished moment for any parent			1
i remember my children saying it , or even better , attempting to say it			2
more wonderful still , perhaps , if that 's possible , is the first time a child says ' my @entity3 ' or ' my @entity4 '			1
my mother remembers that moment to this day			2
after having my sister , but then suffering a series of miscarriages , she and @entity15 adopted me a few days after i was born			1
@entity0 and his birth sister @entity19 they felt that at last their family was complete with me , and as @entity23 always said , it just seemed as if it was meant to be			1
mum is no reader of runes or tea leaves , she 's one of the most rational human beings i 've ever met , but i know exactly what she means			1
it 's the magic of adoption			1
so why do n't more people do it ? in my new series , wanted : a family of my own , we were able to go behind the scenes and expose some of the myths and preconceptions about adoption			1
in each of the four episodes we look at two adoptions and meet the adoptive parents and the children being adopted			2
for the first time , i got a real glimpse of what my parents must have felt all those years ago			2
the assessment process , which has been much publicised , is rigorous and rightly so , but the joy at the end result is matchless			2
my mum 's 90 now and in rude health			1
when she adopted me , times were very different and adoption was of another age			1
back then there were around 20,000 babies adopted every year in @entity60 who had mostly been given up at birth			2
from left to right : @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity0 and @entity64 today it 's around 4,000 children , only about 50 of whom are babies , because back then very young or unmarried mothers were driven to give their babies away by the attitudes of society and all too often the shame of the family			1
the children needing loving families today are usually older than in the past , and have been taken by the authorities from troubled families as youngsters			2
many have a history of abuse or neglect , but some things will never change : children still need a family in 2014 , just as they did in 1962			2
a loving , caring family just like mine			2
this new series is ground - breaking for @entity89			1
it took more than two and a half years to make because of the process itself and the unique partnerships we had to form with eight local authorities			2
in the first episode we meet @entity97 and @entity98			0
like my mum , @entity99 went through the torment of miscarriages			0
@entity97 had two children from a previous marriage , but they were desperate to complete their family so they set off on the adoption road			1
i saw the raw emotion , the desperate yearning - when people want parenthood this much it 's all they can think about			1
when we see their happiness as they finally manage to adopt their little boy ten months later , you know they 're going to be the most amazing parents			0
i get exasperated with some of the thoughtless and occasionally downright ignorant terminology people use			0
@entity0 says that his mother has kept all of the tapes of him presenting @entity122 ' what was it like when you met your real mum ? ' they 'll ask			1
but my adoptive mum is my real mum : she is n't my birth mum , but she is my real mum			0
yes , i did all the birth - tracing malarkey and it was fascinating , bewitching and at times utterly bewildering			0
although it led to me meeting so many of my relatives including my half - sister @entity19 , ultimately , after coming out of the other side of a very peculiar tunnel , my sense of belonging to my adoptive family felt even stronger			0
i was n't being disloyal , i was just completing the jigsaw puzzle , and @entity23 and @entity15 gave me all their loving support			0
that 's what mums and dads do , is n't it ? the modern approach is very different though			1
today there is no erasing of the past			0
heritage is hugely respected now and that really is for the better because the more knowledge a child has of their beginnings , the less of a burning , life - consuming issue it will become in the future			0
of course , it 's never forced on a child or young person to trace their parents , but there are no secrets and contact is always an option if appropriate			1
a few years back i was lucky enough to be chosen for the brilliant @entity173 programme @entity172 ? the subject was my dad - my adoptive dad , my real dad			0
he died in 1996 , hours after i had held his hand and kissed him goodbye			0
as fulfilling and intriguing as the journey into my brand new past and quest for my ' birth ' families had been , and whatever maelstrom of feelings it all stirred up , finding out about @entity15 - his family history , his amazing war record , all the things that made the man who really made me - was so much more emotional than the search for my own biological roots had been			1
when i presented my very first radio show on a local station in @entity197 back in 1982 , @entity15 and @entity23 drove 150 miles to sit in their car outside and listen intently to every cheesy link to every appalling 80s record i played			0
@entity0 as a baby i may be doing them a disservice , but i do n't really think @entity205 was entirely their cup of tea			1
@entity23 still has loads of copies of the @entity122 game show i fronted in the late 80s on video cassette			0
@entity212 does n't cover it			0
i 've had the most amazing mum and dad , and you could be a mummy or a daddy too			0
you can be over 40 , gay or straight , single , divorced or cohabiting , already have children , live in rented accommodation , be unemployed , have a low income or a disability - and still adopt. while i was making this series i did n't meet any prospective parents who thought the process was unnecessarily drawn out or intrusive			1
no more so than a pregnancy anyway ! hopefully , wanted : a family of my own will show the many thousands of potential adopters out there ( and boy are they needed ) that the process is accessible , far easier than they thought and perhaps far more wonderful than they ever imagined			0
i hope , in fact i know , that some amazing potential parents will learn more about the modern reality			0
i believe they will see the process demystified , myths dispelled and then one day soon some beautiful little person will look up at them and say ' mummy ' or ' @entity4 '			0
that is the true magic of adoption			1
wanted : a family of my own airs on 24 april at 9pm on @entity89 .			0

@entity0 will host a new series that follows the journey of adoption
he says he 's sick of the *misconceptions* of adoption and hopes to *challenge* them in the new series
he believes that more couples should consider adoption
