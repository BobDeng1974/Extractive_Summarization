this has led to a dramatic increase in the hunting of the endangered species , which has seen their numbers plummet from one million to just 75,000 in the wild today			0
@entity1 , who is president of the @entity118 - @entity91 , was flanked by environment secretary @entity119 at the conference , and appealed for nations to redouble their efforts in wiping out the illegal wildlife trade			1
he revealed that it was the fourth biggest transnational crime - just behind trafficking in weapons , drugs and people - with a value of £ 11 billion and insisted that stamping out the illegal wildlife trade ‘ needs to be placed very near the top of the global agenda ’			1
‘ organised crime has become heavily involved in the illegal wildlife trade because , quite obviously , there is a lot of money to be made , and the risk of being caught is relatively low , ’ the royal said			2
‘ skyrocketing demand - primarily , but not exclusively , from @entity138 - for ivory , rhino horn and tiger parts , as well as other products , is fuelling this astonishing explosion in poaching			2
@entity21 and his father were shown bottles of ' snake whiskey ' , dried seahorses , ornaments made from ivory that had been covered in boot polish to disguise them and elephant hide books ‘ the bulk of the intended use is no longer for products that can be classified as traditional medicines			1

‘ as a father and a soon - to - be grandfather , i find it inconceivable that our children and grandchildren live in a world bereft of these animals			0
‘ humanity is less than humanity without the rest of creation			0
their destruction will diminish us all			2
’ prince @entity21 , who is president of conservation charity @entity207 , added : ‘ i sincerely hope that my generation is not the first on this planet to consider elephants , rhinos or tigers as historical creatures - in the same category as the dodo			1
’ afterwards the royal pair examined some of the @entity90 ’s most recent grisly seizures from this country , including a stuffed baby tiger , barely a few weeks old			0
@entity21 momentarily closed his eyes in disgust and said : ‘ unbelievable			2
