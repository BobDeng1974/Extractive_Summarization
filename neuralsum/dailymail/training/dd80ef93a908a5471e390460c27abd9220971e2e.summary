homeland security secretary @entity2 said that around 11 million people who are in the country illegally have ' earned the right to be citizens '			1
mr @entity2 said : ' an earned path to citizenship for those currently present in this country is a matter of , in my view , homeland security to encourage people to come out from the shadows			2
' it is also , frankly , in my judgment , a matter of who we are as @entity6			0
he used his speech to more than 270 mayors at the @entity31 in @entity32 to call for ' comprehensive , common sense , immigration reform '			2
mr @entity2 added : ' to offer the opportunity to those who want to be citizens , who ’ve earned the right to be citizens , who are present in this country - many of whom came here as children - to have the opportunity that we all have to try to become @entity6 citizens			2
' ' @entity47 immigration reform would also promote a more effective and efficient system for enforcing our immigration laws , and should include an earned path to citizenship for the approximately 11 - and - a - half - million undocumented immigrants present in this country , something like 86 % of whom have been here almost 10 years			1
' mr @entity2 's intervention came as @entity60 @entity59 's prepared to reveal their plans for a shake - up of the immigration system			1
reform : new homeland security secretary @entity2 said border control was vital to protect @entity6 - but called for reform of immigration ( @entity69 picture ) welcome : homeland security chief @entity2 called for a ' pathway ' for 11 million illegal immigrants to gain citizenship speaker @entity73 of @entity74 and other @entity59 leaders will also call for illegal immigrants to be given the oportunity to gain legal status - but stop short of calling for them to be able to become citizens			1
the 2012 presidential election results showed more than ever the changing face of the @entity6 voting demographics			0
@entity84 won the biggest share of the white vote that any @entity59 @entity60 contender ever has — and he still lost			0
in an election battle that was defined as much as anything by race , @entity84 won the support of 59 per cent of whites , but just 27 per cent of @entity93 , 26 per cent of @entity94 and 6 per cent of african - americans			0
thirty years ago , being unpopular with ethnic minorities would hardly have stopped a white establishment candidate like @entity84 from trouncing @entity98			0
but back then , whites accounted for almost 90 per cent of voters			0
now they make up just 72 per cent of the electorate , and that figure is shrinking by the @entity104 ’s election showed a large turnout by @entity106 , who constituted some 10 per cent of voters — more than ever before			0
with 71 per cent of them voting for mr @entity98 — notably in a handful of crucial swing states such as @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 , where they turned out at the polls in unusually high numbers — hispanic voters gave the president his winning margin			0
they are expected to demand tougher border security during their annual retreat in @entity122 , @entity123 later this week			0
this apparent softening of the @entity59 stance would see the party attempting to reach a consensus with the @entity98 administration			0
in june , last year , the @entity129 passed a measure reforming immigration which included a 13 - year path to citizenship			1
mr @entity2 , who took up the role of @entity136 chief in december , also reiterated the need for effective border policing , adding : ' border security is inseparable from homeland security			2
' ' the five core missions of the @entity136 are guarding against terrorism , securing our borders , enforcing our nation ’s immigration laws , safeguarding cyberspace and critical infrastructure in partnership with the private sector , and supporting emergency preparedness and response efforts at every level , ' @entity2 said			2
' common sense immigration reform is supported by the @entity31 , businesses , and if the polls ( are ) to be believed , the majority of the @entity6 people , ' @entity2 said			1
' and border security must and should be part of comprehensive immigration reform – protecting our borders , securing our ports , promoting the lawful flow of trade and travel through our ports to cities and other communities , ' he said			1
@entity2 touted the alleged improvement in border security over the last four years and said comprehensive immigration reform also would increase that security .			1

@entity2 called for ' comprehensive immigration reform '
he called for a ' pathway ' for 11 million illegal immigrants to gain citizenship
shake up is vital to ensure security across @entity6 's borders
