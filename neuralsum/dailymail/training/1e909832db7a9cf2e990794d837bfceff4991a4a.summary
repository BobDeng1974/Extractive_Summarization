an important announcement on the way cancer can be diagnosed is due today – that will hopefully pave the way for simple blood tests to replace painful biopsies			2
scientists at @entity8 in @entity9 have long been trying to develop a pill that makes cancer cells release certain proteins into the blood			1
in theory , those proteins would then be detected using a quick and easy blood test			0
it is hoped the drug will be sensitive enough to work on even the earliest cancer cells			1
diagnostic breakthrough : researchers at @entity8 are trying to develop a pill that will help detect cancer by releasing certain proteins into the bloodstream if tumours are present the latest research by @entity26 and @entity27 is to be published today in the journal @entity29			2
two years ago , the scientists presented early results from their research at the @entity33			0
they said at the time : ‘ we envision a powerful new cancer management paradigm that involves tumour detection via an initial blood - based assay , tumour localisation via molecular - genetic imaging and tumour treatment			2
’ such a test would detect the cancer cells released by tumours into the blood			1
scientists know that these unique cells are there , but the volumes are so small that so far have found it difficult to detect them			0
the @entity8 team ’s approach involves giving people a drug containing circular pieces of @entity56 which are to break into tumour cells			1
the dna - called minicircles - prompts the cancerous cells to secrete a specific protein into the bloodstream			1
breast exam : any tests of the drug are likely to be initially targeted at those known to be at risk of cancer their conference paper in 2013 said : ‘ we have developed tumour - specific mini-circles [ of @entity56 ] that drive the expression of secretable alkaline phosphatase or firefly luciferase [ proteins ] , and validated them for detecting tumours			1
‘ these can be assayed via serum and non-invasive imaging to differentially identify tumour - bearing from normal subjects			0
‘ importantly , they should have broad applicability in many patient populations ... across many different tumour types			0
’ such tests would most likely be initially targeted at people known to be at risk of cancer .			0

it is hoped the drug will be sensitive to work on the earliest cancer cells
the drug contains circular pieces of @entity56 which break into tumours
they prompt cancerous cells to secrete a specific protein into the blood
