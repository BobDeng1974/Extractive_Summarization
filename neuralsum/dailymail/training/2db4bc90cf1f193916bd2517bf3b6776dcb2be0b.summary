@entity1 's top spokesman shied away on monday from confirming @entity4 prime minister @entity3 's revelation that the president calls by a nickname â€“ ' bro			1
' but it 's the way he dodged a question about presidential nicknames from @entity13 white house correspondent @entity12 that had reporters laughing			2
' to paraphrase a local baseball player here in @entity18 , that 's a clown question , bro , ' @entity15 said during the first press conference since @entity1 and his entourage returned from a lengthy @entity24 vacation			1
the reference was n't lost on a chuckling press corps : @entity27 , an outfielder with the @entity29 baseball team , created that quip in 2012 to dismiss a post-game question he did n't want to answer			1
when a locker - room reporter asked him if he might have that drink in @entity55 , @entity27 grimaced and said , ' i 'm not gon na answer that question			1
that 's a clown question , ' bro			1
' @entity27 , as the journalist should have known , is also a devout @entity60			0
@entity18 's bro - mance with the phrase came full circle a week later , when then - senate majority leader @entity64 , a @entity66 @entity65 , repeated the line in a press conference on @entity69			1
he was sidestepping a question about whether he planned to bring the @entity71 , an @entity1 - favored piece of immigration legislation , to the @entity75 floor			2
@entity64 is known as a devoted baseball fan			0
@entity15 's crown , however , groaned in recognition of what was likely a carefully planned response			2
this year 's news bro - mentum came from an interview with @entity3 conducted by the @entity86 , in which the @entity3 commented on his close relationship with @entity1			1
' yes , he sometimes calls me ' @entity45 , ' @entity3 confided			2
@entity15 insisted monday that he was joking , and then provided an official response			0
' i am not able to give much more insight about the private communications between the president of the @entity51 and the prime minister of the @entity4 , ' he said			1
but , he added , he did n't doubt @entity3 's claim that he and @entity1 were close enough to generate a special nickname			1
' i do n't , because as you know , they have a special relationship , ' @entity15 said			2
but as the press conference ended and the @entity35 's video feed shut down , @entity15 could be heard telling a reporter that he had a backup line in mind if @entity27 's words had seemed the wrong way to go			1
' it was either that , ' he said , ' or " do n't tase me , ' bro "			0
' that was a reference to a more ancient event , but a political one			0
' do n't @entity111 , ' bro ' : @entity114 college student @entity112 became an internet sensation in 2007 when he jumped a q - and - a line and earned an arrest from campus police in september 2007 at a @entity121 event , then - senator @entity119 took questions from an audience of students			0
@entity112 , 21 , jumped the queue and resisted campus police wen they puled him away from the microphone			0
as he struggled , four officers held him down while another zapped him with a stun gun			0
when @entity133 saw the weapon , he shouted , ' do n't tase me , ' bro ! ' one video of that event , posted on @entity138 by the @entity140 newspaper , has been viewed more than 7.3 million times			0
@entity119 was heard on the video , helplessly trying to restore order			0

@entity4 leader is so close to the @entity51 president that @entity1 calls him ' bro , ' @entity3 told the @entity86 .
@entity35 spokesman @entity15 wo n't confirm that account , *choosing* to dismiss the question with a *famous* @entity18 sports quip
' that 's a clown question , bro , ' he told a @entity13 reporter , *mimicking* @entity29 outfielder @entity27
@entity27 , then 20 years old , *coined* the phrase in 2012 when a reporter asked if he could drink beer in @entity55 , where the drinking age is under 21
former senate majority leader @entity64 was the first politician to quote @entity27 , sidestepping a political question a week later
