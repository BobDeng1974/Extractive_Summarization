the world ’s largest solar boat is making @entity2 its final port of call on an epic voyage of scientific discovery along the @entity7			1
the @entity8 has 512 square metres of photovoltaic cells made of up 809 solar panels or 29,124 solar cells			1
the eco-friendly boat is capable of crossing the @entity13 in 22 days , smashing the previous @entity14 of 26 days thanks to its clever design			0
launched in @entity18 , its @entity17 expedition sought to collect a continuous series of physical and biological measurements along the @entity7 , both from the water and the atmosphere , using advanced instruments onboard			1
the vessel is a scientific research platform for the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) , has a top speed of 14 knots and is home to up to nine crew members at a time , including scientists			0
it is stuffed with atmospheric instruments , some of which are prototypes developed by the university and for the past four months has been analysing the @entity7 to collect data that might inform scientists about climate change			1
it is the first time the impressive catamaran has visited the @entity33 and it will be docked at @entity34 from tomorrow until monday 2nd september to show off its solar panels that can generate 480 kwh on a sunny day			0
it is pictured in @entity56 the vessel is a scientific research platform for the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) , has a top speed of 14 knots and is home to up to nine crew members at a time , including scientists led by professor @entity62 , climatologist and director of the @entity64 at @entity39 , the research team studied the key parameters of climate regulation , focusing on aerosols and phytoplankton			2
their aim is to improve the understanding of complex interactions between the ocean and atmosphere , as well as the role these interactions play in climate change			2
he said : ' the @entity17 expedition has allowed intensive testing in real - world conditions of a number of ocean and atmospheric instruments , some of which are prototypes			1
' there is now a wealth of physical , chemical , and biological data housed at the @entity39 , and which is beginning to undergo exhaustive scientific scrutiny			0
here , the boat has ' closed ' its solar panels allowing it to dock more easily			2
it also pulls them in when sea conditions are very rough the boat is approximately 35m long and 23m wide , depending on whether the solar panels are closed			0
in this image you can see the @entity99 to the left ' although the data has not been analysed yet , we have noticed some very interesting trends , especially with regards to the production of aerosols by sea sprays , ' he said			0
the boat is approximately 35m long and 23m wide , depending on whether the solar panels are closed - when it is docked or experiencing very rough conditions at sea - or open , in most instances at sea			0
the boat travels at an average speed of five knots and uses a staggering 512 square metres of photovoltaic panels to power six blocks of lithium - ion batteries			1

crossing the @entity13 in 22 days , the speedy solar boat compares favourably with a 40 foot sailing ship , which usually takes around 35 days to cross the ocean the university believes it clearly demonstrates the possibilities of solar power for sea travel , with massive implications for sustainable tourism and transport			2
with zero fuel requirements and zero carbon emissions , the boat can take to the open seas for months at a time , so long as the sun continues to rise			0

this is the high - tech control panel with a carbon structure , the boat is light , durable and completely silent professor @entity62 said : ' the @entity8 has positive benefits for scientific study and exploration , allowing for pollution - free research to be carried out in the vicinity of the boat			1
' the boat also plays an educational role as the scientists are keen to raise awareness about environmental issues			0
one of the aims of the recent expedition , which stopped at @entity164 , @entity56 , @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 ’s before journeying to @entity2 , is to promote the use of solar technology			1
one of the aims of the recent expedition , which stopped at @entity164 , @entity56 ( pictured ) @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 ¿ s before journeying to @entity2 , is to promote the use of solar technology			2
the next stop is @entity172 it was designed by @entity174 from @entity175 after months of research into creating the optimum dimensions and design of the double - hulled vessel			0
engineers optimised the energy collection and storage as well as the boat ’s aerodynamics , propulsion systems and choice of building materials			0
the light scientific vessel has a carbon structure and is its name is inspired by the literary mythology of @entity192 and literally means ' power of the sun '			2
after visiting @entity2 , the boat will cross the @entity196 and will then dock in @entity172 .			1

the world ’s largest solar boat is making @entity2 its final port of call for the *weekend* before it travels to @entity172
the @entity29 has a *lightweight* carbon structure and 512 square metres of photovoltaic cells
launched in @entity18 , its @entity17 expedition has collected data along the @entity7 to help scientists get a better idea of climate change
