he was destined for the pot – if they had found one big enough to fit			0
but @entity6 the @entity5 giant crab was saved from death when the fisherman who caught him sold him to a @entity10 aquarium for £ 3,000			1
now , after a 29 - hour plane journey from @entity12 – where giant crab meat is a delicacy – and two weeks in quarantine , @entity6 is ready to meet his public			1
catch of the day : held up by @entity19 aquarist @entity17 , @entity6 weighs a mighty 15lbs and measures 15 inches wide - when he is fully grown he will weigh a whopping 30lbs and gain an extra three inches lucky escape : the @entity21 is a delicacy in its native @entity12 and was destined for the dinner table until it was snapped up by a @entity10 aquarium worker			1
he paid £ 3,000 for three and had them flown to the @entity10 he is the biggest crab on display in the @entity10 and weighs a mighty 15lb with a 15 - inch shell – enough to make 160 crab cakes			1
@entity6 is 100 times bigger than a standard @entity10 shore crab			1
yet he is still a juvenile and will grow to double his weight			0
@entity6 was caught off the coast of @entity5 last month , but was sold to the @entity34 along with two other @entity5 giant crabs			1
he will go on display at the @entity37 in @entity38 , @entity39 , on thursday , and his two companions will be moved to other centres in @entity42 and @entity43 if @entity6 responds well to his new home			1
currently he is being kept on his own in a specially made cylindrical tank , ten feet tall and six feet wide , but the aquarium will introduce some coldwater fish once he is settled			2
mini me : @entity6 dwarfs a @entity10 shore crab who is put on his back for size and to show just how gigantic he is big crab , small appetite : ' the crabs do n't eat very much despite being one of the largest species and they will feed on shrimp , prawns , and squid when they are here , ' said @entity63 , aquarist at @entity65 in the wild , crabs eat any dead or dying matter they find on the seabed but @entity6 is currently dining on diced mackerel and squid and is reportedly very happy with his gourmet diet			2
@entity73 , head marine biologist for @entity37 , said : ‘ they are such impressive creatures we thought that it was worth the cost and effort of flying them halfway round the world so they can flourish in an aquarium display			2
‘ they had a stopover in @entity85 and arrived with us two weeks ago			0
it took them a few days to get over the jet - lag but now they ’re feeding happily and do n’t seem any the worse for their trip			0
’ @entity63 , aquarist at @entity65 said : ' when i found out we were getting the crabs in i was really excited			0
massive claws : @entity73 , head marine biologist for @entity37 , said : ' they are such impressive creatures we thought that it was worth the cost and effort of flying them half - way round the world to so they can flourish in an aquarium display ' ' we already have a tank here for them so it will be easy to move them in , and they will go on display straight away			0
' the crabs do n’t eat very much despite being one of the largest species and they will feed on shrimp , prawns , and squid when they are here			0
' we want to increase their numbers but in @entity12 people eat them and i think visitors to the @entity37 will be shocked when they find that out because they look so magnificent			0

@entity6 weighs a mighty 15lbs and measures 15 inches wide and would have produced *20lbs* worth of meat
