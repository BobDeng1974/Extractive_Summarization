with a growing sexual assault epidemic staining the military , president @entity0 urged @entity3 graduates friday to remember their honor depends on what they do when nobody is looking and said the crime has ' no place in the greatest military on earth			1
' the commander in chief congratulated the 1,047 midshipmen graduating at the @entity14 , telling the 841 men and 206 women that they have proven themselves morally by meeting rigorous standards at the academy			0
but their commencement celebration came in the midst of reports of widespread sexual assault throughout the military , and @entity0 ended his 20 - minute address by recognizing ' how the misconduct of some can have effects that ripple far and wide			1
' ' those who commit sexual assault are not only committing a crime , they threaten the trust and discipline that makes our military strong , ' @entity0 said			1
' that 's why we have to be determined to stop these crimes , because they 've got no place in the greatest military on @entity39			2
' with a growing sexual assault epidemic staining the military , president @entity0 urged @entity3 graduates friday to remember their honor depends on what they do when nobody is looking @entity45 : @entity3 graduates throw their hats at the conclusion of their graduation ceremony happy grad : a graduate celebrates as president @entity0 ( left ) greets other graduates arriving on stage his pointed comments were aimed at rooting out the problem at a time when @entity57 have been criticizing @entity0 for not responding forcefully enough to controversies including last year 's deadly attack in @entity60 and political targeting at the @entity62			1
but @entity0 was quick to express outrage over the reports of sexual assault , saying he has no tolerance for it			2
he summoned military leaders to the @entity69 last week and instructed them to lead a process to root out the problem			0
the @entity72 released a report earlier this month estimating that as many as 26,000 military members may have been sexually assaulted last year and that thousands of victims are unwilling to come forward despite new oversight and assistance programs			1
that figure is an increase over the 19,000 estimated assaults in 2011			2

the @entity89 officer who led the service 's @entity91 and @entity92 unit was arrested on charges of groping a woman			0

the president shook the hand of each academy graduate as he or she came to collect a diploma , after graduates took their oath of office as @entity113 ensigns and @entity115 second lieutenants			0
cheers ! : president @entity0 displays a beer stein that he received from @entity119 - @entity118 , president of the @entity3 's class of 2013 , during the @entity3 's graduation and commissioning ceremonies out of line : a member of the 2013 graduating class of the @entity3 peeks over the shoulder of a fellow graduates to listen to president @entity0 during the commencement ceremony the applause that had accompanied earlier portions of @entity0 's @entity3 speech , as he mentioned the @entity134 's killing of @entity135 and called for the building of a powerful 300 - ship fleet , fell to silence as he turned to the sexual assault scandal			1
midshipmen and spectators watching under cool gray skies as a light rain fell listened silently as he repeated the refrain : ' we need your honor			0
' @entity0 urged the graduates to use the leadership skills and values learned at the academy to help prevent behavior in the battlefield that can damage the image of the @entity155 overseas			1
' we need your honor , that inner compass that guides you , not when the path is easy and obvious , but it 's hard and uncertain , that tells you the difference between that which is right and that which is wrong , ' @entity0 said			2
' perhaps it will be the moment when you think nobody 's watching			0
but never forget that honor , like character , is what you do when nobody 's looking			0
' @entity0 's address was the second to a military audience in as many days , coming a day after he laid out his counterterrorism vision at the @entity178 where he defended his controversial drone strikes program and renewed his push to close the @entity181 , @entity182 , detention facility			1
presidential embrace : @entity0 had lots of hugs to go around as he welcomed the grads with open arms president @entity0 congratulates @entity188 with open arms during the @entity3 commencement ceremony singing : @entity3 graduates sing ' @entity191 ' it 's a tradition for presidents to rotate speeches at the commissioning ceremonies of the four service academies			1
the @entity3 , about 30 miles from the @entity69 in @entity197 , @entity198 , says 16 presidents have addressed graduates , and @entity0 is the sixth to do so twice			1
he also addressed 2009 graduates			2
the ceremony and its pageantry could not escape @entity206 's budget fights			2
the @entity113 's @entity208 aerobatic team wo n't perform because of budget cuts due to a fight between @entity0 and congressional @entity57			1
but the ceremony also featured a fitting achievement : for the first time in the academy 's history , an entire family will have graduated from the school			0
@entity155 president @entity0 claps next to superintendent of the @entity3 vice admiral @entity219 traditions : graduating @entity155 @entity221 take the @entity113 oath of office @entity224 was joining his brother @entity225 and sister @entity226 , twins who graduated in 2010 , as well as his father @entity230 and mother @entity229 as alumni			1
' @entity230 and i never expected anything like this , ' said @entity229 , who graduated in 1980 in the first class that included women			0
' in fact , if anything we probably discouraged the kids from going , because if you do n't come in for the right reason , which is to serve your country , you 're not going to last			0
' @entity242 , of @entity197 , wrote the book ' @entity244 : women join the ranks at the @entity3 ' about the difficulties of being in the class of 1980 , the first that included women .			0
