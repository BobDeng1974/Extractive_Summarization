it was the allure of mystery that pulled some bidders to the courtroom , but for others , it was the sheer value of a collection unknown to the public before @entity17 was found dead in his modest ranch - style home last year			2
regardless of motivation , those who converged on the auction could sense the immense value of the treasure upon arriving			2
sold : appraiser @entity25 stands among gold coins discovered in a @entity5 garage which were auctioned off for $ 3.5 million on tuesday gold : @entity31 50 peso pieces , two seen here , were among the $ 3.5 million in gold coins auctioned off with one bidder securing nine of the 11 lots there were numerous guards at the entrance , then more in the hallway outside the courtroom , and finally several with bullet proof vests and others with helmets inside the room holding the gold			1
five bidders diligently inspected the 11 lots of gold displayed in plastic sleeves , tubes and felt jewelry display boxes in a heavily guarded room before the bidding wars began			2
by the time all sales were final , however , one bidder had secured nine of the 11 lots for sale			0
@entity60 's @entity59 of @entity61 spent $ 617,000 from his own company , and another $ 2 million on behalf of the @entity64 - based @entity63 it was the uniqueness of the gold that drove his bidding , he said			1
' every one of us has a little hoarder nature in our culture and we all like to have things , but to this degree is quite a story , ' @entity59 told reporters after the auction , adding that the metal value ' is not as exciting as the story itself , there 's actually value to the story			1
' discovery : a crew sent to clean out this modest @entity60 , @entity5 home after the quiet death of @entity85 discovered more than $ 7.4 million worth of gold coins in the garage owner : it took several weeks before mr @entity90 was found dead in his home , having been unmarried and authorities having to search strenuously to find an heir he added that some of the coins will be available in the store or online for locals hoping to snag a piece of history			1
others , he said , will be marketed nationally and likely on television			0
this auction was only for the bullion coins -- items that are not necessarily rare , just expensive because they are made of gold			1
there will likely be a second auction for the larger portion of the collection which is comprised of the rare coins , said @entity111 , the public administrator for @entity17 's estate			1
' they 're buying and bidding on an ounce of gold , pure gold by the weight , ' @entity111 said			2
in total , about 150 pounds of gold was sold at tuesday 's auction			1
about $ 800,000 will pay various fees and estate taxes , and the rest of the profits go to a substitute teacher in @entity126 , @entity127 , who is the first cousin and sole heir to the trove of @entity17 because of the other coins ' rarity , that sale is expected to net higher profits			1
@entity134 of @entity136 's @entity135 and a @entity127 - based group named @entity138 grabbed the two lots not purchased by @entity59 or his partners			2
@entity134 landed the lot of 4,600 @entity31 dos pesos , the largest number of coins in a single lot			2
he said the story posed no additional value to him			0
' it had the most potential for profit , ' @entity134 said of his purchase			0
' there was one lot i wanted more , but this one will have to do			0
' that lot , a collection of 620 @entity158 @entity157 , was the largest in terms of weight and the coins were the purest gold available			1
it fetched $ 1.16 million from @entity59 and the @entity63 of @entity164			2
heir : @entity127 substitute teacher @entity166 has been officially declared the rightful owner to the fortune and will receive any proceeds after $ 800,000 in taxes and fees are payed no one knows exactly when the collection began , or why @entity17 never sold it			1
frankly , no one knew anything about him even though he lived in the same neighborhood for decades			0
weeks passed before authorities even discovered he had died in his modest @entity60 home			0
a coroner said he died of heart problems			0
when cleanup crews arrived , they made the startling discovery of the 69 - year - old man 's vast collection of thousands of gold coins worth millions of dollars stashed in old ammunition boxes in his garage			1
officials discovered the trove neatly wrapped and stored mostly in ammunition boxes stacked on top of each other			0
there were more than 2,900 @entity199 coins , many from 1915 ; more than 5,000 from @entity31 ; at least 500 from @entity200 ; 300 @entity164 gold pieces , some dating to 1880 ; and more than 100 @entity164 gold pieces as old as the 1890s			1
among the coins were meticulous records of the purchases dating back to at least 1964 , when gold averaged about $ 35 per ounce			1
the precious metal currently sells for more than $ 1,600 an ounce			0
authorities believe that his mother , who lived with @entity17 until her death in 1992 , purchased most of the coins			0
despite the millions of dollars in his garage , @entity17 did n't appear to lead a luxurious life			0
records show he only withdrew about $ 500 a month to pay modest bills			0
he died with $ 1,200 in a checking account and just a bit more than $ 165,000 in a money market and mutual fund account			0
since learning of her inheritance , @entity166 has shunned publicity and not made any comments about the fortune .			0

nearly half of @entity85 's gold was auctioned off on tuesday
$ 800,000 of proceeds will go going to fees and estate taxes and rest to @entity85 's heir
auction was only for the bullion coins which are not necessarily rare , just expensive because they are made of gold
