the new @entity1 mobile phone services in the @entity2 are not as super-fast as the industry promised - and could get worse			1
the mobile phone companies boasted that @entity1 services would be ‘ five times faster ’ than the existing 3g networks when they launched in the autumn of 2012			1
however , a new official study puts the real figure at an average of 2.5 times faster - 14.7 megabits per second compared to @entity13 per second on the 3g service that most people use			1
a study by @entity17 says 4g speeds in the @entity2 are slower than promised			1
mobile phone companies boasted @entity1 would be five times faster than @entity14			1
but the actual figure is actually only 2.5 times faster - 14.7 megabits per second			1
shown is an @entity23 smartphone at a news conference in @entity25 launching @entity1 in 2012 at the same time , the evidence suggests that @entity1 services are likely to slow down as more people connect to them			0
@entity1 technology is being promoted by the big mobile networks on the basis it offers high speed internet access and smooth video streaming without annoying buffering			2
more than 10 million people have been won over by the promises and have signed two year contracts costing an average of £ 20 ( $ 30 ) a month			0
the @entity1 speed data comes from the telecoms regulator , @entity17 , which supports the technology and insists the figures show a meaningful and significant benefit over the @entity44			2
despite this , the figures make clear the step change has not been as remarkable as the major networks - @entity47 , @entity49 , @entity50 and three - promised			1
@entity17 ’s research compares the speed and geographic coverage of the networks and puts @entity47 , which is the subject of a £ 12.5 billion ( $ 18.5 billion ) takeover by @entity57 , on top			2
@entity47 ’s @entity59 , which covers 81 per cent of homes and businesses , delivered the fastest average download speed of @entity63			0
this looks good when compared with its 3g service , which was a slow @entity67			0
second fastest was @entity50 with 16.4 for @entity1 versus 6.6 for @entity14			1
@entity49 came next at 13.9 versus 6.6 , followed by three at a relatively slow 8.5 for @entity1 which was not very impressive against the 5.4 for @entity14			1
upload speeds are important when sharing content , such as pictures and videos to social media sites like @entity74 and @entity75			0
@entity47 was also fastest on this measure at @entity77 , followed by @entity49 on 13.2 , @entity50 on 13.1 and three with 9.4			1
the three network was the fastest to load a web page at 0.63 seconds , compared to 0.71 for @entity49 , 0.76 for @entity50 and 0.77 for @entity47			1
there is good evidence to believe the speeds offered by @entity1 are slowing down			0
when 4g services launched at the end of 2012 , the average download speed was up at around 19 mbit / s , however the new research suggests an average of 14.7 and other studies put it as low as 10			0
this has happened because more people are using the service , effectively causing jams on the airwaves			0
the only way this can be countered is if the networks spend millions upgrading masts and installing new ones			0
@entity17 ’s research compares the speed and geographic coverage of the networks and puts @entity47 , which is the subject of a £ 12.5 billion ( $ 18.5 billion ) takeover by @entity57 , on top			2
@entity47 ’s @entity59 , which covers 81 per cent of homes and businesses , delivered the fastest average download speed of @entity110 the @entity17 figures are based on 120,000 smartphone tests in five sample towns and cities - @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity120 / @entity119 - between october and december			1
its study found that download speeds in @entity115 fell by 12.5 per cent between the summer and end of last year			0
the time to call up a web page improved marginally from 0.8 seconds to 0.72			0
@entity17 admitted : ‘ as more people are taking 4g services from the mobile operators , this is likely to affect the average speeds being received			2
’ the speeds for @entity117 were unchanged over the same period , while there was no data for the other areas			0
@entity136 , @entity17 ’s consumer director , said the study is designed to boost competition by helping consumers decide which mobile networks are offer the best service			2
he said : ‘ people are increasingly connected , communicating and sharing content on their mobiles when out and about			0
‘ @entity1 is delivering a significantly enhanced mobile experience and , as these services roll out across the @entity2 , our research will support consumers when choosing the right mobile package for their needs			2

study by @entity17 says 4g speeds in the @entity2 are slower than promised
mobile phone companies boasted @entity1 would be *5x* faster than @entity14
but actual figure is actually only 2.*5x* faster - 14.7 megabits per second
out of the networks , @entity47 was fastest , followed by @entity50 , @entity49 and @entity161
