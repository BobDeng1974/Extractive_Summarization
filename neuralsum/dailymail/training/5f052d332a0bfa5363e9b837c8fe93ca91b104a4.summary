they 're the toughest @entity1 waters in the world - almost mythical in their ability to frustrate sailors , with extreme icy conditions rendering them largely off limits			0
but now a cruise line is offering intrepid travellers the chance to face the @entity10 - the route through northern coast of @entity13 , connecting the @entity15 and @entity16 oceans			0
in 2016 , the @entity17 will take 900 passengers on the largest expedition through the @entity10 ever made , setting passengers back between £ 12,500 and £ 93,000			1
the luxurious @entity17 cruise ship ( pictured ) will be the first to traverse the @entity10 departing from the @entity22 , the 32 - day journey will sail around @entity24 and into the @entity25 , through the @entity26 and on to @entity27 , before docking in @entity28 @entity30 sailor @entity29 left @entity31 with two ships in 1845			1
the expedition never made it ; all 129 of the crew perished in the @entity26 high @entity1 ice			1
@entity39 explorer @entity37 - who later led the first successful expedition to the @entity42 - made history by crossing the @entity10 in three years reaching the @entity16 in 1906			0
in 1942 a second ship replicated @entity37 's achievement , and only in 1944 did anyone do so in the space of a single year , without being forced by the ice to halt midvoyage for the winter			1
by the mid- 1990s , only three or four ships made the journey each year			1
four ships made the journey in 2006 , by 2013 , that had increased to 18			1
@entity56 's 132 - guest @entity55 recently successfully completed the journey through the @entity10			0
the 23 - day voyage commenced in @entity59 , @entity27 on august 9 and concluded in @entity60 , @entity24 on september 1			1
it covered a distance of nearly 3,500 nautical miles			0
but the route has never been attempted by a ship of this size			1
@entity66 , executive vice president of @entity67 explained : ' a lot of small expedition ships have now gone through the @entity10 and even some commercial ships			1
' ' but we do n't have 100 guests on board ; we have 800 or 900			0
to do it with a ship like ours , we need to do it differently			2
' the ‘ once - in - a - lifetime expeditionary voyage ’ is being offered by @entity67 is set to appeal to wildlife lovers and those curious about our changing world			2
departing from the @entity22 , the 32 - day journey will navigate the @entity10 , around @entity24 and into the @entity25 , through the @entity26 and on to @entity27 , before docking in @entity28			1
holidaymakers will get the chance to see amazing arctic wildlife in its natural habitat , such as humpback and beluga whales , seals and walruses , oxen , kittiwakes and murres in flight			2
there will also be the chance to meet indigenous people , living in small @entity1 settlements on the route			0
the trip is two years in the making and the first cruise will depart on august 16 , 2016			1
@entity1 sea ice conditions have shifted , making it possible for a wider range of vessels to sail the passage only around 200 ships have ever sailed the whole length of the @entity10 since @entity39 explorer @entity37 ( who later became the first man to reach the @entity42 ) made history by crossing it in 1906			1
only in 1942 did a second ship manage to replicate his journey			2
but more recently , @entity1 sea ice conditions have shifted , making it possible for a wider range of vessels to sail the passage			1
it is not without its risks though			0
in 2010 , an expedition ship named the @entity125 ran aground there			2
the crew and 118 passengers were rescued by a @entity26 icebreaker			1
amazing wildlife in its natural habitat : passengers on @entity17 will see a range of arctic animals the area is served by seven icebreakers , operated by @entity138 's coast guard , but rescues can be lengthy due to the sheer scale and remoteness of it			2
so @entity17 will be prepared for all eventualities , travelling with a support vessel , which can break channels through the ice , a helicopter pad and facilities for towing and evacuations			0
and the cruise liner insists that they will not impact the small arctic towns and fragile environment			2
@entity66 told @entity154 : ' we want to do this in a responsible manner and educate people			0
i understand that some people may not like that , but i think we can have a positive impact			0
' ' we are not going to leave anything behind			0
not a single drop of garbage or anything else			0
' passengers will disembark in small groups of 150 - 200 when visiting @entity1 settlements and @entity66 insisted that the local populations were enthusiastic about showcasing their culture to interested visitors .			0

@entity174 to make its virgin arctic voyage in august 2016
ship will sail from @entity24 and into the @entity25 , through the @entity26 and on to @entity27 , before docking in @entity28
only around 200 ships have ever sailed whole length of the passage
