@entity8 , 22 , was travelling downstream on his board in @entity10 when he spotted the furry animal sat on the rock			1
realizing the squirrel had nowhere to go , mr @entity14 , from @entity15 , @entity16 , swam towards it and attempted to goad it on to his board so that he could push it to safety			1
it was immediately washed downstream before becoming trapped in a small hole underwater			2

thankfully i managed to pick him out of the water and place him on my board before i swam him to shore			0
' once he was on my board he realized what i was doing and just chilled and enjoyed the free ride			0
