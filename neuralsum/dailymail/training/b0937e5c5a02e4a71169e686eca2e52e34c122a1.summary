baby blues : @entity14 scientists have identified changes in use of the site that suggest a woman is at risk of crippling mood changes , indicative of post-natal depression , after her baby is born in future , it may be possible to create an app – a computer programme that can be run on a smartphone – to provide early warning and dispense advice			1
around one in seven new mothers suffers from post-natal depression but the stigma surrounding the condition leaves many afraid to seek help			1
@entity47 , head of @entity49 ’s biggest lab , hopes that by making diagnosis easier , more new mothers will get the attention they need			1
however , there are likely to concerns about privacy , particularly when dealing with the sensitive area of public health			0
dr @entity47 began by scanning archives of @entity11 messages – ‘ tweets ’ of up to 140 characters posted publically on the internet - for words and phrases related to the announcement of a birth			1
when he was satisfied he had identified several hundred new mothers , he began to analyse the their messages from the three months before and after having their baby			2
he looked for changes in the amount of time the women spent on @entity11 , the people they were in touch with and the language used			2
for instance , an increase in the use of ‘ i ’ suggests someone is becoming more introspective and self - focused and has been linked to the onset of depression			0
pattern : dr @entity47 , head of one of @entity49 's biggest labs analysed tweets from new mothers			1
he then created software that scoured pre-birth tweets to predict with of over 70 per cent accuracy if a woman ¿ s @entity11 messages would show signs of depression after having her baby he then created software that analysed pre-birth tweets to predict with over 70 per cent accuracy if a woman ’s @entity11 messages would show signs of depression after having her baby			1
adding in her tweets in the first fortnight after motherhood boosted the accuracy to 80 per cent			2
a second study using @entity111 posts confirmed that even although depression does n’t hit until post-birth , changes in social network activity and postings pre-birth provide information about who is likely to be hit			2
dr @entity47 said ‘ we can predict future behaviour and mood with well - characterised confidence ’			1
he told the @entity122 ’s ( must credit ) annual conference that someone could use his basic research to create and early - warning system that a pregnant women could install on her mobile phone			0
he said : ‘ reading some of these tweets you can almost feel yourself in the hearts and minds of these people			0
you really feel for them as they struggle			0
‘ imagine a new mums ’ coach that was an app running on your own smartphone that might watch what you say to the world and your tweets			0
‘ it might say “ i sense you might be grappling with this , here ’s more reading about this , do n’t worry it will last this long and here are resources for you ” , versus people just being abandoned right now and crying on their own and being paralysed			0
’ he added that while there are likely to be ethical concerns , the app would be something that was run privately , on a woman ’s own phone			0
@entity159 , of post-natal depression charity the @entity161 , said many women with post-natal depression find the thought of a medical appointment daunting and would welcome a test they could do in the comfort of their own home			1
however , he questioned whether they would get the support the needed afterwards .			0
