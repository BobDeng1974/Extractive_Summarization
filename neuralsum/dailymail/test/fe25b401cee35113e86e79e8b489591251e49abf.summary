if @entity0 becomes @entity2 ’s new supremo , the comeback hopes of @entity4 , which gained momentum with the sacking of @entity7 , would come to an abrupt halt			1
@entity0 said on saturday that he can see no way back for the man he fell out with so badly over the messages @entity4 sent to @entity13 opponents apparently criticising him as captain three years ago			1
@entity4 begins his county comeback with @entity16 against @entity17 in @entity18 on sunday having been encouraged to return to the domestic game by @entity21 chairman - elect @entity20 and emboldened by the demise of @entity23 , the man who sacked him last year			1
@entity0 ( right ) says the @entity4 affair is a ' distraction ' for @entity29 cricket @entity0 and @entity4 pictured during happier times during the 2011 series with @entity32 yet his hopes of an @entity2 return would seem over if @entity0 succeeds in becoming the new @entity2 director of cricket after throwing his hat into the ring on friday			1
‘ it ’s very important for @entity29 cricket to move on from the @entity4 situation , ’ said @entity0 , who infamously called @entity4 ‘ a complete c * * * ’ on air last season when he thought his microphone had been switched off			1
‘ that threatens to envelop everything at the moment			0
the story has become more of a distraction than him actually playing			0
it ’s become that big			0
the @entity21 and the @entity2 team ’s efforts to move on from him have n’t worked so far but by winning that will allow them to move forward			2
’ @entity0 ’s views are as much from a cricketing point of view as a personal one , even though his feelings towards @entity4 clearly have not changed			1
‘ if you look at it from pure cricketing logic , after the @entity65 is over , it ’s quite hard to see a situation where @entity4 would come back into the side , ’ @entity0 told @entity59 editor and @entity61 cricket writer @entity60 on the @entity63 ’s podcast			1
‘ you ’re building towards the next ashes in two and a half years time and the @entity73 in 2019			0
@entity4 has rejoined @entity16 for the county season in an attempt to regain his @entity2 place @entity4 's chances of a recall have been boosted by the likely appointment of @entity80 in the new @entity21 director of cricket role created following the sacking of @entity7 as managing director ‘ i think if you were to bring @entity4 back it would be a short - term measure to help you win the @entity65 but i ca n’t see that happening personally because there are too many bridges to build in too short a period of time			1
i think after the @entity65 the story does move forward at that point			0
’ @entity80 remains favourite to pip @entity0 for a role that would have powers not enjoyed by anyone in @entity29 cricket since @entity97 in the @entity98			1
@entity20 and new @entity21 chief executive @entity99 want to overhaul the system and make the new man more the equivalent of a football manager than a managing director , as was @entity7			2
that means the director of cricket will probably be a hands - on presence in the dressing room with overall responsibility for coaching and selection , with the panel of selectors almost certainly being disbanded			2
there were key figures who wanted @entity0 to take the job when @entity119 stood down 18 months ago , not least the @entity120 himself , but at that stage @entity0 felt it was too early for him and he has dabbled in commentary while not being a natural at it like @entity126 and @entity127			2
@entity4 and @entity80 pictured together on @entity2 duty at @entity129 in 2008 @entity0 , who played in 82 tests with @entity4 , believes his recall would only be a short - term measure now the new regime at the @entity21 have moved the goalposts and the man @entity20 and @entity99 want is clearly @entity80 , if they can persuade him to give up his extensive lucrative media work and other cricketing interests			1
@entity80 is here to commentate on @entity2 ’s three - @entity139 series against @entity140 for @entity141 and intriguingly is staying at the same hotel as the team			2
it will be fascinating to see whether he changes a hard - hitting commentary style that has seen him criticise several of the players who he may well now take charge of , with the @entity21 looking to make a quick appointment			0
@entity80 will need to build some bridges himself with a number of @entity2 players if he takes over but clearly @entity20 is not concerned by what has happened in the past and feels his fellow @entity154 is perfect for the role			1
@entity156 , who will be playing his 100th test needing four wickets to become @entity2 ’s leading wicket - taker , did not want to get drawn into which of his former @entity2 captains should get the big job			0
@entity2 bowler @entity156 refused to be drawn on who he would prefer to take up the role ‘ i do n’t really have an opinion because we ’re concentrating on building up to a @entity139 , ’ said @entity156			0
‘ that ’s for the two new guys in charge			0
they ’ve obviously got a clear plan of where they want to take @entity29 cricket and i ’m sure they ’ll get the right man for the job			0
’ even though it was a diplomatic answer it was perhaps revealing that @entity156 then named @entity126 and @entity0 as the best captains he has worked under , a view that was consistent with his autobiography where he offered little praise to the 2005 @entity65 - winning captain @entity80			1
clearly , @entity184 and even @entity185 will be almost auditioning for @entity80 in this series and it is impossible to see @entity188 in particular carrying on as coach alongside a man in @entity80 who has been so critical of him			0
the distractions that @entity0 talked about , not just those provided by @entity4 , clearly still loom large over an @entity2 team who , it should be remembered , won the last three @entity139 they have played			2
it is imperative , not least for their captain and coach , that they continue that run here .			0

former skipper @entity0 says @entity4 return is out of the *question*
@entity4 would ' have too many bridges to build ' before coming back
*batsman* has joined @entity16 to *rediscover* form ahead of ashes
but @entity0 says *ongoing* saga is too much of a ' distraction '
@entity0 has been linked to @entity21 director of cricket role
but another former captain , @entity80 , is favourite
