@entity0 claims that he posed as a black man while he applied to medical schools in 1998 because he believed he had a better chance of gaining acceptance after opening up about his experiences of posing as a black man to apply to medical schools , @entity6 ’s older brother has said that his sister does not approve of his actions			1
on his blog , almost @entity12 , @entity0 said that none of his family approves of his book , in which he ’ll controversially claimed he was only accepted into medical school in the late 1990s because he posed as a black man			1
‘ my sister @entity6 ( @entity6 ) , of the @entity20 and @entity21 ? , strongly disapproves of my book , ’ he wrote			1
‘ she actually said , “ this book will bring shame on our family ”			0
the rest of my family does not agree with the book			2
still , they respect my right to make my own decisions with my career , ’ he added			0
@entity35 - @entity0 says on his blog that he felt he had to change his appearance to get into the @entity37 and heavily attacks affirmative action policies in the @entity39			1
' i was determined to become a doctor and i knew that admission standards for certain minorities under affirmative action were , let 's say … less stringent ? ' wrote @entity0			1
' i got into medical school because i said i was black			2
the funny thing is i 'm not			0
' he claims in 1998 he shaved his head , trimmed his ' long @entity50 eyelashes ' and joined the @entity51 during the process			1
though his website , @entity54 , shows side - by - side qualifications and pictures of @entity0 as an @entity50 - @entity39 man ( left ) and a black man ( right ) , he does n't specify if he went through the same application process as an @entity61 - @entity39 man as he did a black man his change in appearance was ' so startling that my own fraternity brothers did n't recognize me '			1
' @entity0 the @entity50 - @entity39 frat boy became @entity67 the @entity69 applicant to medical school , ' he said , claiming that @entity67 was the middle name he was born with			1
as an @entity50 - @entity39 with a gpa of 3.1 , @entity73 of 31 and a member of the @entity75 , he did n't think he 'd get into medical school , but with a change of appearance and switch of student organization , he thought he could get into some of the top schools in the nation			1
' i became a serious contender at some of the greatest medical schools in @entity39 , including @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , and @entity90 , ' he said about the application process			2
' in all , i interviewed at eleven prestigious medical schools in 9 major cities across @entity39 , while posing a black man , ' he added			1
despite his startling claims , @entity0 fails to mention if he applied to the same schools at the same time as an @entity50 - @entity39 man			1
he also does not seem to appear repentant about presumably taking a place at college that would otherwise could have gone to another person			0
@entity0 said that his sister , sitcom star and comedienne @entity6 told him not to move forward with the book when he was finally accepted to @entity37 , he used the acceptance to claim he was only granted admission because he was black and used the situation as an example of what was ' wrong ' with affirmative action			1
indeed , @entity0 admits that he did not even complete his medical degree and dropped out before he qualified as a doctor			2
@entity35 - @entity0 also admits he found posing as a black person to be socially fascinating			1
' not everything worked out as planned , ' he wrote on his website			0
store clerks accused me of shoplifting			0
women were either scared of me or could n't keep their hands off me			0
what started as a devious ploy to gain admission to medical school turned into a twisted social experiment			2
' and unsurprisingly , @entity0 has been at the end of a huge backlash following his contentious claims			2
the @entity130 claims that though his experience ' revealed inherent cultural bigotries that feed systematic racism ' , @entity0 did n't bring everything he could to the table			0
' he chooses to sidestep , downplay , or flat - out ignore how the same racism that led to him being harassed by cops and store clerks keeps black applicants on the fringes of elite educational institutions for generations , ' @entity136 wrote			0
' it 's easier for him to tap dance for the right wing as the brown man who “ gets it ” , while conveniently missing how ongoing racism makes affirmative action absolutely necessary , ' he added			2
and though he claims he became a serious contender at schools across the nation as a black man , he does n't specify if he went through the application process as an @entity39 - @entity50 man			1
' @entity0 seems to have assumed that he would 've gotten nowhere as an @entity50 @entity39 applicant and dove head first into this poorly - conceived ' experiment ' before determining otherwise , ' @entity136 wrote			1
and more so , @entity136 claims that @entity0 's experiment ' is insulting to what black people endure in this country , both institutionally and culturally '			2
@entity136 claims : ' and as a person of color , it 's irresponsible for him to be so invested in the idea of individual exceptionalism that he ignores structural inadequacies			0
' black people ca n't be as ' racist ' as whites societally , mr. @entity0			0
you did n't spend your time applying to black colleges in the hopes of finding work as a doctor in black - owned and operated hospitals			0
' and a major reason why you were in a position to be considered for entry into any white institution is because black people generations before you made that possible through sacrifice and hard work			0
' the attempt to undermine their work for the sake of promoting false ' equality ' is truly regrettable			0
but when you conduct social ' experiments ' that cite @entity195 @entity194 's @entity193 as an inspiration , it 's obvious that you do n't take these issues all that seriously			0
' a spokesperson for @entity6 was unavailable for comment .			0
