by @entity0 it may not look like a typical sundial , but this cube could help you tell the time without ever having to look at a clock			2
inside the cryptic cube are hundreds of metal channels cut to exactly match the angle of the sun in the sky			1
as the sun hits the cube , the channels project dot - matrix style numbers onto a surface to mark the hours passing			1
the ‘ @entity21 ’ is the brainchild of @entity18 - based artist @entity17 who recently shared his invention on @entity20			1
he describes how he spent a month making the laser - cut sundial for his father 's birthday last july			1
mr @entity17 was inspired by solargraphs which are pinhole photographs , typically capturing the passage of the sun over days or even months			2
but do n’t get rid of your clock just yet , as even mr @entity17 claims there are some major drawbacks to the design			0

by mapping the angle of the sun in the sky each day , @entity17 was able to input his data into a computer programme that used boolean logic			1
the computer programme was able automatically subtract one shape from another shape to come up with the perfect design			0
for instance , mr @entity17 said it can only be used one month in the year and will only work within 100 miles of his father ’s home			1
as well as this , it could only be used for 40 years because of the changing tilt in @entity63 's axis			2
‘ a friend wanted to [ do ] a @entity66 for this , for the @entity69 inventor series			0
i would n't let him i was like " no , it 's not interesting " , ’ mr @entity17 told @entity64			2
‘ it 's an obscure toy that works in one part of the world			0
and it 's a clock			0
it 's inventing something that is actually worse than what exists on the market			0
a cereal box has more functionality ’			0
mr @entity17 , however , is considering building a large scale sculptural version for the @entity82 festival in @entity84 's @entity83			0

inside cube are metal channels that correspond with sun 's angle in sky
as the sun hits the cube , the channels project dot - matrix style numbers
the @entity21 can only be used one month a year and within a 100 - mile radius of a *specific* location on @entity63
