they may not be regarded as the world ’s greatest lovers , but it seems you can rely on @entity6 men where it really counts			2
that ’s right – our chaps are far more likely to be found scrubbing sinks or dusting the dining room than any other men in @entity15 , a study has found			2
there ’s still some way to go before they catch up with women , who typically do a bigger share of household chores			0
rule britannia : a study of more than 58,000 people living with partners in the @entity6 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 looked at how long they spent doing a range of chores but in @entity6 , men do a third of the work , while those in @entity29 and @entity28 only manage a fifth			1
the study of more than 58,000 people living with partners in the @entity6 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 looked at how long they spent doing a range of chores			1
the @entity29 team logged time spent cooking , ironing , cleaning the house , washing dishes , doing the laundry and odd jobs , gardening and shopping for groceries			0
‘ if all housework is considered , the @entity6 would rate as the most egalitarian country , followed by @entity26 , @entity27 , and as more inegalitarian cases , @entity28 and @entity29 , ’ said lead author @entity49 , of @entity50 in @entity51			1
‘ the difference is significant : men in the @entity6 do on average one third of the housework whereas in @entity28 , they hardly manage 20 per cent			1
’ participants were asked to keep a diary of what they did during each 15 - minute period of the day			0
still trying to impress ? the study also found that cohabiting men were more likely to do housework than their married counterparts the lion ’s share of chores fell to women – except in shopping , where the work was evenly split , and some ‘ occasional male tasks ’			1
@entity28 couples spent the most time on household chores – seven hours per day between them			1
the @entity6 came in fourth , at five hours and 52 minutes , while the @entity26 spent the least time			0
the study , published in the @entity75 , also looked at the difference between married couples and those who were cohabiting , but not married			1
it found cohabiting men were more likely to do housework than their married counterparts			1
the average married male did 23 per cent of the chores , but those who had yet to walk down the aisle did 30 per cent , a trend researchers suggest is partly down to a desire to impress a partner			0
‘ cohabiting unions hold more egalitarian divisions of household labour , both in terms of quantity – percentage of household load – and quality – types of task performed , ’ the researchers wrote			0
they said living together may be ‘ part of a partner selection process ’ in which willingness to do chores is seen as ‘ a desirable trait ’			0
living as an unmarried couple was most common in @entity26 , where 20 per cent chose to cohabit , followed by the @entity6 with 14 per cent			0
young people were the most likely to live together when not married			0
a separate study this week found women in the @entity6 do more unpaid housework and childcare than those in most other countries			2
the research by the @entity114 found that in a week , married @entity6 women spend an average of 11 more hours on household matters than their husbands do , while putting in three hours less in paid work .			2

cohabiting men more likely to contribute than husbands , study finds
but @entity28 couples spend most time on housework overall
