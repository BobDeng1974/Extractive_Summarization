by @entity0 published : 16:39 est , 26 june 2013 updated : 16:50 est , 26 june 2013 the daughter of @entity3 supermodel @entity2 has posted a set of photos on @entity6 that reveal the stunning transformation she has undergone in the past year			1
@entity8 , now 15 , posted the two pictures on @entity6 , with the caption ' 1 year ago at the same time # lol # transformationtuesday '			1
the photos , the first taken in summer 2012 and the second taken exactly a year later , show how much the young girl has come to resemble her mother after losing the puppy fat and ' growing into herself ' , as she puts it			1
growing up : left , @entity8 in may this year			1
right , just one year earlier in 2012 another pair of photos show her as a slightly awkward - looking nine - year - old in 2007 , smiling brightly in 2013			1
set on the same path to modelling success as her mother , @entity8 is featured in a multiple page photoshoot in @entity25 this month , which she has posted on her @entity6 page , saying , ' yay ! i did an amazing shoot with # @entity30 a couple months ago for their august issue and it is finally hitting newsstands this week ! it was such a fun and amazing experience			1
. everyone go out and buy a copy ! thank you soo much '			0
she confesses that despite acquiring a newfound confidence since turning 15 , she sought body image advice from her model mother ahead of the shoot			2
' i said , " @entity43 , should i diet ? " and she was like , " no ! you do n't need to be skinny , you just need to be confident and fit			0
you should n't just be a piece of cardboard '			0
grown into herself : sailor in 2007 at the age of 9 , and then six years later in 2013 @entity2 revealed in an interview this week she thought she was ' fat ' during her own early days as a model			0
the blonde bombshell , 59 , shot to fame in the late 1970s on @entity54 's @entity53 and went on to spend 25 years as the face of @entity56			2
but while she was admired around the globe for her dazzling good looks , it took her years to find her confidence			0
she told the new issue of @entity63 magazine : ' i came across an older picture of me that someone had posted on @entity67 and i totally remember squirming and feeling very fat while i was shooting it			0
' and i look at it now and think , i was actually really thin ! how is it possible that i felt so uncomfortable in that body ? ' awkward phase : looking slightly uncomfortable in 2010 at the age of 12 ... and six years ago : @entity2 and sailor at an event in @entity76 in 2007 happy family : sailor aged 8 in 2006 with brother @entity79 , then 11 , and mother @entity2 good genes : sailor in 2004 aged five with brother @entity82 , mother @entity2 and father @entity83 little blondie : sailor in 2001 aged three , attending a benefit in @entity76 with @entity2 ' how is it possible that i felt so uncomfortable in that body ?

@entity8 , 15 , posted two photos of herself taken a year apart
in the first , taken in summer 2012 , she was a *chubby* - *cheeked* tween
