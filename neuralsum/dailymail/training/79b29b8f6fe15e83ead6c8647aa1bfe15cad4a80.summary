by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ riathalsam there are n’t many folk in football who know more than @entity6 about the peculiarities and challenges of caretaker management			2
he is the annual solution of @entity11 , the club who three times in as many seasons have turned to the same man to put out their fires			1
each time , he reduces his workload as the academy manager and goes to whip the big kids into shape			1
each time , he knows there is something of the substitute teacher about this situation , which he has experienced an astonishing five times when you factor in stints at @entity29 and @entity30			2
once more into the breach : @entity6 has embarked on his third caretaker spell at @entity11 in the space of three seasons following the departure of @entity36 on the opening day of the season ‘ you learn the post massively through experience — you have to make it clear : “ i am a manager , not a caretaker — put that to bed and put the same effort in ”			1
’ that was @entity6 explaining how he addresses the class			2
‘ i do n’t want people to ease off the gas , ’ he added			0
the 54 - year - old was talking after @entity11 lost 3 - 1 to @entity53 on saturday , a game he never would have expected to oversee			1
by the standards of a man who has spent almost four decades in football , taking charge after one game ‘ is a new one to me ’			1
it has been a strange few days at @entity11 , starting with the 4 - 0 defeat by @entity64 , then the staggeringly early departure of their manager , @entity36			1
when chairman @entity68 revealed late last week that @entity36 had actually walked away — not been sacked , as per the accepted wisdom — he said his former manager complained that the players were ‘ gone ’ , as were the fans			1
in form : @entity74 scored @entity53 's second goal in their 3 - 1 home win over @entity11 on saturday what worse time , then , to face @entity53 , for whom another season in this division would be viewed far differently than it would at @entity11 ? what more appropriate time to face @entity53 , the club who have had their share of dysfunctional moments ? for @entity6 , the fans stayed onside and , more importantly , the players did as well , even after @entity74 made it 2 - 0 and then 3 - 1			1
‘ our spirit impressed me , ’ said @entity6			1
those things matter to a manager , but especially a caretaker			0
he ’s seen the lot , has @entity6 , a former player for @entity11 as well as @entity95 and @entity96			1
he runs a good academy at @entity11 and since managing @entity98 for 60 games at the turn of the millennium has had no overwhelming desire to return to permanent management			1
‘ you have moments , ’ said @entity6			1
‘ do n’t get me wrong , on tuesday ( in the 5 - 3 @entity106 win over @entity107 ) i enjoyed it			2
at 3 - 1 down people are shouting , “ you ’re getting sacked in the morning ”			1
spirit : @entity111 pulled the scoreline back to 2 - 1 but @entity11 were unable to get an equaliser ‘ when you get back to 3 - 3 and win 5 - 3 you get that adrenaline buzz again			1
’ his caretaker career has so far spanned 14 games across his five stints			0
‘ my shortest one was after @entity119 ( sacked in 2012 )			0
i did n’t get a game			0
‘ we had two days — a light training session on the thursday , then an international break and the new man came in			0
my longest was last year ( after @entity126 ’s sacking ) — we had five games , lost one , drew a couple and won a couple			2
‘ in these last few days i have felt comfortable with the group			0
the experience helps and i think that ’s why the club asked me to step in			0
they know it is in decent hands			0
’ on he will go			0
at some point soon he will return to the work he really loves , but always ready to man the hose			0
‘ you just go on , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity11 know i will just keep going			2
you take one game at a time			0
’ spoken like a true manager			2
performance of the weekend in the first instance , @entity144 ’s 2 - 1 victory over @entity147 heavyweights @entity146			1
in the second , the squabbling of the two managers after @entity151 ’s winner			0
@entity144 ’s @entity153 celebrated in front of @entity155 , before the two men had to be separated			0
@entity153 said : ‘ i ’m not going to apologise to him because he said things to me			0
’ over the top ? @entity161 manager @entity155 thought this celebration by his @entity144 counterpart @entity153 was too much , leaving to an altercation at the final whistle what 's caught my eye ...			2

academy manager @entity6 has been @entity11 's interim manager three times in three seasons
*terriers* went down 3 - 1 at @entity53 in the @entity147 on saturday
he took over when @entity36 left the club following a 4 - 0 home loss to @entity64 on the opening day
@entity6 said taking over after just one game was ' a new one for me '
@entity*18*3 ’s attack . he said after @entity53 beat @entity11 that he has ‘ *strikers* *galore* ’ and it ’s true . of the eight players @entity*18*3 *signed* this *summer* five are in *attacking* positions . it ’s fun but his squad looks unbalanced .
a possible end to @entity195 ’s *troubles* at home . the 1 - 0 win over @entity198 was @entity96 ’s first at @entity199 ’s in the league since *october* 1 , 2013 — a run of *18* games .
an *£* *11million* substitute on @entity206 ’s bench against @entity207 . @entity208 is not fit enough to get in @entity206 ’s side .
