parents have been warned of the dangers of ' highly toxic ' essentials oils by a doctor who says they can cause serious problems ranging from convulsions to corneal ulcers if used wrongly			1
essential oils such as eucalyptus , clove and peppermint are commonly found in decongestant products such as @entity12 , and used by parents on children suffering from winter coughs and colds			1
reassured by the list of natural - sounding ingredients , parents are happy to sprinkle them on a child 's pillow , in their bath or on a tissue			0
but paediatric consultant @entity23 , who works at a busy central @entity25 emergency department , says she has dealt with a string of cases where children and babies have required hospital treatment after drinking or otherwise ingesting harmless - sounding oils			1
@entity32 , three , needed emergency treatment in hospital after he drank @entity12 and got it in his eye , right a doctor has warned of the dangers of children accidentally ingesting products containing essential oils - this photograph shows chemical burns caused by @entity12 which show up green under blue light dr @entity23 , 39 , who works at the emergency department at @entity45 and @entity46 in @entity25 , is calling on the manufacturers of such oils to put a child - proof cap on the bottles to reduce the numbers of young - and old - patients needing urgent treatment after misusing the products			1
she said : ' in the last five years we have seen at least 38 children , and probably more , who have presented having ingested , put in their eyes or up their nose some kind of essential oil - containing substance			1
' these included @entity12 , @entity63 , room diffuser liquids , liquid air freshener , citronella oil and other aromatherapy oils , and of these 38 children , six had significant clinical findings			2
' dr @entity23 said all 38 children were admitted to the ward for observation or required observation for at least six hours			1
she said of the six with ' significant ' symptoms , two children had corneal ulcers , one had nervous system findings ( drowsiness and unsteadiness walking ) , and three had breathing difficulties			1
the consultant , who is so concerned she is keeping a dossier of hospital admissions as a result of accidents with essential oils to strengthen her case for manufacturers , says the chief culprit is eucalyptus oil			1
at least 38 patients have been admitted to @entity45 and @entity46 in @entity25 after accidentally ingesting essential oils she said : ' @entity94 oil is particularly toxic - in @entity95 , where eucalyptus oil is more widely used , there have been reports of children who have drunk it presenting with convulsions			1
' we often see children who have put it into their eyes or nose because the size and shape of the bottle makes it easy to mistake for eye or nose drops			2
' and children who put it into their eyes are risking serious corneal damage at worst , and quite significant discomfort at best			2
' children who suffer corneal ulcers will need at least one course of antibiotics dropped directly into the eye , as well as flushing with large quantities of saline solution			1
drinking the oil can cause changes in heart rhythm , such as tachycardia , where the heart rate speeds up , or irregular heartbeats			0
@entity133 paediatric consultant dr @entity23 has treated scores of children who have ingested essential oils and says parents must be aware of the dangers dr @entity23 said she 'd heard of cases where ingestion of essential oil had caused death , but said she had no direct evidence of it at the @entity133 department she worked in			1
other side - effects can include breathing problems caused when the drops are put into the nose accidentally			1
the oil acts as an irritant , which causes mucosal tissue to become inflamed and a dramatic increase in mucusal secretions			0
this can cause vomiting , which in turn can see the oil getting into the lungs			0
dr @entity23 says the problems are not confined to young patients			1
she said : ' elderly patients have also been known to put it in their eyes because it 's in such a small bottle			0
' one elderly patient came in after her carer put it in her nose by mistake thinking it was nose drops			0
' and she said the ' natural ' image of the oils could lull people into a false sense of security			0
' these essential oils are seen as natural products so they are not thought of as medicines and are therefore not stored as medicines , ' she said			1
' people keep them in the last place they used them , which is often beside the bath or on the shelf by the child 's bed			0
' given that if ingested , they have the potential to do really nasty things , i think the ones that are sold medically should be more clearly labelled and should have childproof caps so that a child ca n't take off the top			0
' kids get put off pretty quickly if they 're struggling to take the top off and move on to something else			0
' i would also like to see the other commonly sold essential oils coming with a childproof cap too			2
' parents must be warned that these products must treated as drugs , not as nice smelly stuff you put in the bath			0
' three - year - old @entity32 , from @entity208 , south west @entity25 , needed emergency treatment at the @entity45 and @entity46 after he opened the bottle of @entity12 kept in his bedroom , sipped it and put some in his eye			1
his mother , @entity213 , flushed out his eye with eye drops before ringing @entity216 who told her she had to take him straight to @entity133			0
she said : ' he 's my third child so i thought i knew what was dangerous and what was n't , but i had no idea @entity12 could cause problems , and had left it in his bedroom after sprinkling some on his pillow when i put him to bed			1
' later i heard crying from upstairs and when i ran up he told me he 'd opened the bottle and put some in his eye and his mouth			0
' ' he 's my third child so i thought i knew what was dangerous and what was n't , but i had no idea @entity12 could cause problems			2
' - @entity233 , whose son was admitted to hospital after putting oil in his eye mrs @entity233 rang @entity216 as a precaution and was shocked when they offered to send an ambulance , saying her son needed to be seen by a doctor within one hour			2
she took him to @entity45 and @entity46 where he was seen by @entity243 , who said he had to have his eye washed out with two litres of saline solution before being checked to see if there was any corneal damage or residue from the oil			0
@entity32 also had to wear a heart monitor for several hours to see whether his heart rate would be affected by swallowing the @entity12			1
mrs @entity233 said : ' it was all quite shocking and frightening - one minute i 'd put him to bed with a blocked nose and the next minute we were in @entity133 having a heart monitor strapped to him			2
' having his eye washed out was upsetting as i had to pin him down while the nurse flushed his eye with an enormous bottle of salt water and he screamed and screamed			0
' we spent the night on the children 's ward so his heart rate could be checked and luckily he was fine , but when i talked to my friends with children , none of them had heard that @entity12 could be so dangerous			2
' figures from the @entity266 show that between april 2012 and march this year , 5,432 people were treated as inpatients after accidentally poisoning themselves with substances including essential oils			2
a spokesman for @entity273 health care , manufacturer of @entity12 , said : ' we take this kind of incident very seriously and take on board all suggestions for ways we can improve our products			0
' @entity12 is a safe and effective medicine when used as instructed and like all medicines must be kept out of sight and reach of children			0
' we have emphasised this on the packaging which complies with all the necessary regulations and has been approved by the @entity289 medicines authority ( @entity290 )			0
