by @entity0 published : 16:20 est , 12 march 2013 updated : 10:21 est , 13 march 2013 the introduction of the new unleaded petrol , called @entity3 , could have alarming consequences for motorists @entity7 ’s transport minister has asked oil giants to delay introducing a new ‘ green ’ petrol that could put up the cost of driving and even damage older cars			1
the @entity13 revealed yesterday how plans to introduce the new unleaded petrol , which is called @entity3 , could have alarming consequences			1
estimates suggest it could add around £ 80 to the annual driving costs of a family and might even cause some components on the engines of older cars to melt			1
transport minister , @entity22 , is particularly worried about the impact on poorer families who tend to drive older cars			1
@entity7 petrol companies are planning to introduce the new fuel , which contains 10per cent ethanol created from corn , later this year			0
the firms are required to start selling the ‘ green ’ petrol under @entity32 directives requiring them to increase the amount of biofuel they sell or face large fines			0
the idea is that this will reduce the use of fossil fuels and the resulting creation of greenhouse gasses linked to global warming			0
@entity7 ’s @entity44 ( @entity44 ) has calculated that the new fuel is not compatible with as many as 8.6million older vehicles on the roads in this country			0
the high ethanol content means the fuel could effectively melt seals and components in the engines of older cars , motor cycles and even lawnmowers			1
significantly , a study published by the respected think - tank @entity57 , points out that @entity3 petrol is less efficient that standard petrol , which means drivers do fewer miles to the gallon			1
the net effect is that a family driving 10,000 miles a year will end up buying more fuel and paying around £ 80 a year extra if they use @entity3			1
in theory , oil companies could introduce @entity3 at any time that suits them , however mr @entity22 has asked them to delay			2
@entity3 will be sold from pumps alongside @entity72 , which is 5per cent ethanol and compatible with all petrol engines , standard unleaded petrol and diesel			1
mr @entity22 is particularly concerned about the impact of the new fuel on poorer families who tend to drive older cars			1
they may find the engines fail if they inadvertently use the @entity3			2
ministers wants the oil firms involved to give the government at least three months ’ notice of any move to sell the fuel			0
transport minister @entity22 is worried about the impact @entity3 will have on older cars in the meantime , @entity44 officials are drawing up a public education campaign about the new fuel and compiling a database of vehicles that are not compatible , which would be made available to drivers			1
significantly , the @entity7 government has no legal powers to stop petrol suppliers from launching @entity3 here			1
mr @entity22 said : ‘ i have made it clear to fuel suppliers that we would like them to delay supplying @entity3 until the number of incompatible vehicles has reduced and the market is ready			2
‘ i am particularly conscious that it is often poorer people with older cars who may be particularly affected			1
‘ although it is ultimately a commercial decision , we believe this is the right approach to minimise the impact on hard - pressed families			0
’ @entity113 , of @entity114 , said the government has the power to mitigate the increase costs of using @entity3			1
‘ the government should protect the motorists from any increase in the cost of motoring caused by the introduction of @entity3 by cutting the rate of duty			2
currently , the combination of duty and @entity127 , means the tax on fuel is about 80p a litre , ’ he said			0
suppliers , such as @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 , are working on the introduction of @entity3 petrol through a body called the @entity138 ( @entity139 )			1
@entity132 said it would not disclose the details of discussions with politicians about the timing of the introduction of @entity3			2
a spokesman said : ‘ @entity32 member states are committed to increasing the amount of biofuels in the fuel mix by 2020 as a means to using more renewable energy			0
‘ @entity132 is working with industry on a wide range of measures to ensure that our customers will be properly informed well in advance of any future changes to our products			0
’ @entity133 referred calls to @entity139 , which said it had no date for the introduction of @entity3			2
the organisation will co-ordinate a public information campaign when the fuel is launched in the @entity7			0
@entity3 was launched in @entity165 two years ago , however most motorists have refused to use it amid fears it might damage their cars			2
a spokesman for @entity139 said : ‘ we are trying to make sure that as and when it is introduced , that happens without the problems seen elsewhere			0
there will be a database showing which cars can and ca n’t use it			0
’ it is difficult to find reliable figures on the number of vehicles that are not compatible with @entity3			2
a @entity44 study published in 2010 put the figure at 8.6million and predicted this would fall to around 4.3m by 2013			0
motor industry estimates suggest some two million vehicles are known to be incompatible , and a further one million might be			0
there is also an unknown number of motorcycles , power tools and ride - on lawnmowers that will also be incompatible with @entity3 .			0

unleaded petrol called @entity3 could add £ 80 to a family *'s* annual driving costs
@entity3 may even cause engine problems in some older cars
