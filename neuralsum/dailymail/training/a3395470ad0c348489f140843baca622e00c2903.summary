by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:33 est , 18 march 2014 updated : 05:52 est , 18 march 2014 two thirds of voters want @entity5 to increase the amount people earn before paying tax , instead of a tax cut for middle and high earners , a new poll shows			1
only 13 per cent of people think the chancellor should use tomorrow ’s budget to increase the point at which workers start paying the 40p higher rate of tax			2
it will bolster mr @entity5 ’s determination to face down calls from @entity23 mps to take action to help the 1.3million extra people dragged into the 40p band			1
two thirds of people back a rise in the income tax threshold over increase in the 40p rate chancellor @entity5 is expected to use tomorrow 's budget to increase the income tax threshold to £ 10,500 the coalition parties have become bitterly divided over how to use extra cash in the @entity37 coffers to cut income tax			1
the @entity39 have pushed for an increase in the amount workers can earn before paying any income tax			1
in april it will hit £ 10,000 – up from £ 6,475 in 2010 – but mr @entity5 is expected to go further and increase it to £ 10,500			1
it will mean basic rate taxpayers will pay £ 800 less income tax in 2015 than in 2010			1
however , mr @entity5 has faced a storm of criticism from some conservatives for freezing and lowering the higher rate of tax			0
in 2010 when the coalition was formed there were 3.02million people earning more than the £ 43,875 threshold where they started paying the higher tax rate			2
but this year the threshold has fallen to £ 41,450 , which means 4.4million now pay the 40p rate			0
in 1988 just 1.35million was paying that rate			0
according to a @entity63 poll for the @entity64 , 66 per cent of people want mr @entity5 to use any money available for income tax cuts to increase the personal allowance			1
only 13 per cent favour an increase in the 40p tax threshold , 10 per cent want neither change and 11 per cent do n’t know			1
in a further boost for mr @entity5 , 33 per cent of people now think he is doing a ¿ good job ¿ as chancellor , up from 26 per cent in december mr @entity5 has extended his lead of @entity77 for being the best chancellor to 13 points , the @entity63 survey for @entity64 found there has been clamour from conservative backbenchers , backed by former chancellors @entity85 and @entity86 , for mr @entity5 to announce a significant hike in the threshold to ensure the higher rate is once again reserved for the biggest earners			0
but deputy prime minister @entity91 insisted even those paying the 40p rate are better off as a result of increases to the tax threshold to £ 10,000			1
he told @entity97 : " there 's a huge misconception about this			0
yes , it is true that more people are paying the 40p rate of income tax , but no , they are not paying more income tax			2
deputy prime minister @entity91 insisted even those paying the 40p rate of tax were better off ‘ it might sound counter-intuitive , but because we 've raised the point at which you start paying income tax , finally reaching my long - cherished aim of removing income tax paid on the first £ 10,000 you earn as of next month , you are also better off as a 40 per cent income tax payer			1
‘ far from paying any extra income tax as a 40 per cent income tax payer , you are on average about £ 300 better off			2
‘ in other words , you pay £ 300 less income tax than you might have done at the beginning of this @entity124			2
’ asked if there would be any change in the 40p rate tomorrow , mr @entity91 in a further boost for mr @entity5 , 33 per cent of people now think he is doing a ‘ good job ’ as @entity78 , up from 26 per cent in december			0
some 39 per cent think he is doing a bad job , down from 46 per cent at the end of 2013			0
the @entity23 chancellor has also extended his lead over @entity136 rival @entity77			0
in the latest @entity63 poll 35 per cent said mr @entity5 would make the better chancellor , compared to 22 per cent who said mr @entity77 – a 13 point lead			0
in january last year , only 32 per cent said mr @entity5 , to mr balls ’ 23 per cent , a 9 point lead .			0
