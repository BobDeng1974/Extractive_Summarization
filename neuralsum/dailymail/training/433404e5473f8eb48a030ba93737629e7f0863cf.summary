hearing the sound of birdsong and listening to music is something most of us take for granted , but around one in every 1,000 babies is born deaf and many people lose their hearing as they get older			1
@entity10 implants have revolutionised life for people who are deaf or hearing impaired and can not benefit from a hearing aid			1
but until recently , the experts who design and implant the devices have not known what they sound like			0
now , scientists have revealed what it sounds like to hear via an implant			1
now scientists have revealed what the world sounds like through their ears the cochlear implant is a surgically placed under the skin behind the ear and includes microphones to pick up sounds and a speech processor to prioritise audible speech externally - splitting the sound into channels and sending the electrical sound signals though a thin cable to the transmitter			1
the transmitter is a coil held in position by a magnet placed behind the external ear that transmits power and the processed sound signals across the skin to the internal device by electromagnetic induction			0
a receiver and stimulator secured in the bone beneath the skin concerts the signals into electric impulses and sends them though an internal cable to electrodes			0
an array of electrodes wound through the cochlea send the impulses to the nerves in the scala tympani and then to the brain through the auditory nerve system			0
as of december 2012 , approximately 324,000 people worldwide have received cochlear implants			2
in the best case scenario , the implants , which convert sound to electric impulses that travel to the brain , allow patients who can not hear anything at all to achieve 100 per cent speech understanding			2
@entity78 , an @entity79 professor of speech and hearing science , made the discovery of what the world sounds like via an implant , when one of his patients who had lost hearing in both ears and had received an implant , regained his natural hearing in one of his ears			1
‘ that allowed us to have him match the sound quality of an implant with his hearing ear , ’ he said			1
‘ and we 'd always wondered , “ what does it really sound like ? ” ’ ‘ it was a tremendous help to us in understanding cochlear implants			2
’ the experts first experimented with tones in order to pinpoint what certain frequencies sound like to someone wearing an implant			2
the video shows that they appear slightly echoey , but nonetheless amazing to someone who has been without the ability to hear either temporarily or since birth			0
they then showed what speech sounds like via a cochlear implant and it is clear – if slightly more robotic than natural hearing			1
professor @entity78 ’s team is currently working on a project to test the performance of patients by using a surround sound system that is calibrated so that if someone sits in the middle of the array of speakers , it sounds as if they are in a restaurant			0
busy spaces like restaurants can be a difficult places to distinguish speech for people with hearing difficulties			0
' it 's really a striking replication of the environment and will help them evaluate new signalling algorithms for the implant , ’ he said			0

@entity10 implants enable some people who are deaf - or have heavy hearing loss and can not benefit from a standard hearing aid - hear again
scientists have revealed what it sounds like to hear via a cochlear implant and tones sound a bit echoey and speech a little robotic
an expert at @entity79 conducted an experiment with a patient with natural hearing in one ear and an implant in the other
