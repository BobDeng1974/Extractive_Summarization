the @entity1 administration went into bunker mode on tuesday after news leaked that the president had selected former deputy defense secretary @entity5 as his next @entity7 chief			1
an @entity9 internet hoaxer created a fake @entity11 account in @entity5 's name tuesday morning and tweeted that he had gotten the job			1
and two major news outlets claimed to have inside information that the @entity5 pick was a done deal			2
but @entity19 press secretary @entity18 was tight - lipped in his press briefing			1
' what i can tell you is – not much , ' he told reporters			0
' mr. @entity5 is obviously somebody who has generated a lot of headlines today			2
' @entity18 said @entity5 ' certainly deserves and has demonstrated strong bipartisan support for his previous service in government , ' but insisted , ' i do n't have any additional insight to share with you			1
' a @entity19 official had told @entity33 earlier in the day that ' we are not in a position to confirm the personnel rumors , sorry			2
but @entity9 journalist and schoolteacher @entity56 had everyone fooled into thinking @entity5 had publicly confirmed the rumor			1
' president @entity1 phones me announcing his decision to appoint me as defense secretary			1
i 'm honoured and happy , ' read a tweet from an account in @entity5 's name , created tuesday morning			0
the @entity68 spelling set off digital speculation , however , and @entity56 admitted his ruse an hour later			0
@entity56 is known for impersonating famous figures on @entity11 , including author @entity72 , former @entity74 president @entity73 and @entity76 president @entity75			1
he has also fooled @entity9 newspapers into publishing phony interviews he claimed to have conducted with authors @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85			1
nevertheless , @entity86 and @entity87 both reported that @entity1 would name @entity5 – the real one – to succeed outgoing defense secretary @entity88			1
@entity5 , a former deputy secretary at the @entity7 who has never served in the active military , had been considered a leading candidate for the job to replace @entity88 , who is resigning			1
other front - runners , however , had already said they did n't want the thankless job			1
@entity94 , who was poised to become the first female @entity7 chief , pulled out last week			0
@entity97 sen. @entity96 followed suit days later			0
a @entity7 spokesman told @entity100 that he was unaware of a decision to name @entity5 to the post , and referred reporters to the @entity19 , which had no immediate comment			1
a spokeswoman for @entity5 also had no immediate comment			0
other names have been circulated as a possible replacement for @entity51 , including former navy secretary @entity109 and @entity110 , a former assistant secretary of state for east asian and pacific affairs who now heads the @entity113 , a strategy and capitol advisory group			0
@entity56 is known for impersonating famous figures on @entity11 , including author @entity72 , former @entity74 president @entity73 and @entity76 president @entity75 @entity1 said last week that the ousted @entity51 , the only @entity117 in his cabinet , was an ' exemplary ' defense secretary and ' is and has been a great friend of mine ' since he was a ' green behind the ears senator ' serving on the @entity123 @entity51 was the first enlisted combat veteran to lead the @entity7 but earned very little support from his fellow @entity117 in the @entity125 homeland security secretary @entity126 , a former general counsel at the @entity7 who had been believed to be under active consideration , also took himself out of consideration , according to a source familiar with the situation			1
@entity5 was the no. 2 official at the @entity7 from october 2011 to december 2013			0
previously , he was the @entity7 's chief arms buyer			0
he also served as assistant secretary of defense for international security policy under president @entity133			2
@entity5 has bachelor 's degrees in physics and medieval history from @entity137 , a doctorate in theoretical physics from @entity140 , where he was a @entity141 scholar , according to the @entity7 's website			2
@entity5 's academic record brought gen. @entity144 , chairman of the @entity145 , to joke at @entity5 's farewell ceremony in 2013 that he has been called an ' uber - wonk ' and that in @entity149 circles he would be considered ' not hot			2
' but @entity144 said @entity5 had earned respect far and wide			0
' it 's lucky for us that you have worked without glamour or fame behind the scenes to make sure through good management and common sense and discipline that we are an organization that continues to adapt to the challenge that we find in front of us , ' @entity144 said then			0
' he did it all again without fanfare			0
in fact , i think he 's been called the most important , least known figure in @entity168 , or some language to that effect , and i agree with that			0
' @entity51 resigned under pressure last week after less than two years at the helm of the @entity7 .			0
