tale for two members of the media advised to have rabies jabs before heading out to @entity4 scoffed at the notion that it was n’t just dogs but also monkeys they had to look out for			2
scoff no more , though , after a family of three monkeys clambered across telephone wires and down a tree to gain access to the breakfast room at a @entity15 hotel on monday morning			0
50 mw @entity16 has had recent power shortages , but their neighbours @entity18 supplied 50 megawatts of electricity to help ensure their big match against the @entity22 was n’t interrupted			1
helping hand : @entity18 supplied electricity to @entity16 so the big match against @entity22 would n't be missed late and we wo n't wait you may have noticed a smattering of empty seats at some stadiums at kick - off , which is not unusual for a @entity32			1
but the situation is not being helped by the authorities refusing to allow planes to land at airports for an hour either side of match kick - offs			2
so if your plane is late , it ’s really late			0
on that same note , the touts are not having a great time out here , simply because many locals ca n’t afford to attend games			1
one group of @entity48 tourists were trying to sell @entity49 v @entity51 match tickets at face value before yesterday ’s game but could n’t get rid of them			2
picture of the day @entity55 has kept himself busy in @entity4 collecting football stickers			1
the eccentric @entity57 posted this photo on his @entity60 page after filling the @entity62 section entirely with pictures of himself			1
team player : @entity55 filled up the @entity62 page in his @entity32 sticker album - with snaps of himself ! spat of the day @entity69 was in good company on the @entity72 sofa with @entity73 and @entity74 but was put in his place by the @entity76			1
when @entity69 compared a gritty @entity77 to his @entity79 team taking on @entity80 , @entity73 replied with a condescending : ‘ we managed ... ’ @entity83			0
good memories @entity4 tv is a bit 1970s at times , but the current @entity89 ad is a cracker			0
@entity92 ’s street kids re-enact some of @entity4 ’s greatest football moments , including @entity95 ’s goal in the 1970 final			0
@entity98 players are refusing to talk to the press after they were photographed bathing nude by two snappers lurking in the bushes			1
upset : @entity98 players , including @entity105 star @entity104 , are refusing to speak to media after pictures emerged of them bathing nude at the team 's hotel in @entity4 best of the bets each day , @entity113 ’s top tipsters @entity111 and @entity114 go head to head with their best bets			1
follow their tips in @entity113			0
@entity120 one team packed full of @entity123 stars blew it on saturday night against @entity62 but another one can get off to a flyer on tuesday			2
@entity126 can be bright in @entity4 so back @entity127 at 6/1 for the first goal when they take on @entity130			0
