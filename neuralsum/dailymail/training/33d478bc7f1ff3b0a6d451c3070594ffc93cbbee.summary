by @entity0 if you have trouble deciding what to have for dinner , help could soon be at hand – with your food texting to tell you it needs eating			2
scientists have developed a computer chip that can be inserted into food packaging and is able to assess when the contents are nearing their use - by date			1
computer chips which can assess when food is getting past its sell - by date could soon be inserted into some food packaging , an @entity17 committee of peers has heard			1
write caption here the chips could also potentially alert the owner by sending them a text message telling them they need to eat the food			2
the new technology could be far more effective than traditional sell - by dates which do not account for the conditions it is being stored in			2
it could also radically reduce the amount of food which is thrown away			0
food waste group @entity37 said @entity39 households throw away seven million tonnes of food every year , of which just over four million tonnes is avoidable , costing £ 12billion			1
committee chair @entity40 told environment minister @entity41 that one witness giving evidence to the committee in the @entity45 said : ‘ we ’re quite close to commercial production of a small chip which would go into packaging which would measure the actual deterioration of the rate of food			1
’ she said that the current convention of the best before date ‘ assumes that everything ’s equal ; it just assumes that you all keep your food at the same temperature whereas this would actually respond to what the real conditions are ’ , whereas the computer chip could even ‘ send you a text to tell you that it needed eating ’			1
mr @entity41 said : ‘ i should be intrigued to know the range and amount of resource that would have to go into producing it			0
’ @entity67 added : ‘ i ’m having enough trouble with my text messages without the fridge texting me			0
‘ realistic or not , it ’s interesting to see where innovation can lead			0
’ fights waste : the development could help combat the 7million tonnes of food wasted annually in the @entity39 food waste has been examined closely in recent months			1
towards the end of last year , supermarket giant @entity77 revealed it generated around 30,000 tonnes of food waste in the first six months of 2013			1
the majority of the waste was made up of fruit , vegetables and bakery items			0
it found that up to two thirds of supermarket food ends up in the bin , including 68 per cent of bagged salads , half of bakery goods and a quarter of grapes			0
a lot of the food was thrown away by customers but large amounts were wasted because they were left on display too long			0
the same @entity17 committee was also told that £ 2.5billion of food is thrown away by @entity39 restaurants , pubs and the wider hospitality sector every year			1
the waste - totalling 920,000 tonnes a year , enough for 1.3billion meals - costs each individual outlet an average £ 10,000 annually			2
@entity105 , ceo of @entity107 waste management , said restaurants should promote the use of doggy bags to reduce waste volumes .			0

computer chip can assess when food is getting past its sell - by date
it is far more accurate than traditional best - before labels
@entity17 group in @entity45 hears it is ' quite close to commercial productions '
could help combat the 7million tonnes of food waste in @entity39 every year
