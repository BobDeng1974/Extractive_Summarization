according to a lawsuit filed at @entity13 , women working at @entity11 's bar were required to remove wedding and engagement rings ; wear ' sexually provocative ' , cowboy - style clothing ; take part in bawdy drinking competitions with male customers , sit on their laps , and pour alcohol into their mouths ; and kiss each other while riding a bucking mechanical bull			1
on one occasion , to mark @entity27 , women were even asked to wrestle in a pool of cranberry sauce , the @entity25 reported			1
the level of the settlement is not known			0
there is no suggestion that the woman pictured is one of the plaintiffs total bull : the bar is famous for its mechanical bull , which has been at the centre of the sexual exploitation law suit			2
female employees at @entity11 's were allegedly forced to dance for male customers and sit on their laps , wear sexy cowgirl outfits , and even wrestle in a pool of cranberry sauce the working environment at the bar , the suit alleged , led to the women being subjected to ' pervasive and regular unwelcome sexual comments ' and advances by customers and male staff			1
but those who complained were criticised for not being ' team players '			0
' managers frequently remind the female servers that they are expendable and tell them that ' 20 other women ' are willing to take their job , ' court papers said			2
according to the @entity25 , female workers were also called ' ugly ' or ' stupid ' by male managers if they were not ' throwing the party ' or looking ' attractive enough '			0
they were also forced to play drinking games with the manager of the bar and his friends , the suit says			0
the bar has also been accused of secretly recording titillating images of the women , and routinely posting them on @entity82 , @entity83 and its own website without their consent			2

court papers say that women were urged by their bosses to ' take off their shirts ' and ' kiss other female employees when they ride the bull together '			1
embarrassing : @entity11 's mechanical bull is so notorious that it once featured on @entity114 cartoon @entity106			1
its sexual connotations are satirised by the character @entity116 , who is shown wearing a bikini top party time : @entity11 's publicity posters featured sexually provocative images of women , seemingly leaving potential customers in little doubt about what to expect			2
female employees were allegedly required to remove their wedding rings before starting work , and to flirt with male customers - and each other ' during the ride , the @entity11 's @entity131 periodically stops the music and announces over the microphone that if the female employees who are riding the bull " make out " with each other , there will be a free round of shots of alcohol for all customers , ' the papers said			1
' the customers yell and scream for the female employees to kiss one another ' , and the women were ' expected to submit to the degradation '			0
this is not the first time that the restaurant and bar , which is owned by @entity152 , who also owns the popular bars @entity154 's and @entity155 's , has found itself in court			0
