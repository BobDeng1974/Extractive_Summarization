the 1.4acre estate , which comprises 9,000sq ft of living space across a four - bedroom house , a three - bedroom ' casita ' and a two - bedroom pool house , was the home of the fashion designer for over 30 years until her death earlier this month			1

@entity24 launched her business in the 1950s - by accident			1
she was socialite with time to spare and a wealthy husband who owned citrus groves , so she started a juice stand on a busy shopping street			2
she needed dresses in tropical prints ( no dowdy aprons for @entity95 ! ) that would hide stains			2
the loose , sleeveless cotton shape that came to be known as the shift was perfect for the task and local climate			0
' i designed collections around whatever struck my fancy			0
fruits , vegetables , politics or peacocks ! i entered in with no business sense			0

' it 's so not fashion - y , but it is fashion because it has such a strong point of view			0

@entity1 also paved the way for today 's popular lifestyle brands , including @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163 , and even @entity164 , @entity114 added			0
it was a different business than the avant - garde catwalk designers showing in @entity167 during the ' 60s			0
it was about loyalty and longevity instead of drastic swings of the pendulum			0
then - first lady and fashion plate @entity172 , a former schoolmate of @entity1 , wore one of the shifts in a @entity177 photo spread , confirming the look 's legitimacy			0
