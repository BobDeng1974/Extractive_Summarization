a frozen fountain dyed red to support hopes for a @entity3 playoff win ended up just looking like an arctic murder scene on friday			1
@entity6 officials eager for their home team 's first trip to the @entity9 since 1970 experimented this year at the @entity11 fountain , known for its beautiful winter ice mounds			2
unfortunately for @entity3 fans , the startling result also preceded a spectacular loss to the @entity15 on saturday and kicked off a round of stinging ridicule by national media and hometown fans alike			1

let 's go , honey : @entity54 were treated to a ghastly scene in @entity6 after the failed attempt at showing team spirit gory geysers : as the day progressed , the gory frozen geyser progressed from crimson - spattered wonderland to a fleshy pink wasteland ' looks like something horrible happened ' : pinkish ice and slush shot out of the fountain , which freezes every year into what are usually more pleasant frozen piles ' looks like the scene in @entity46 were @entity47 is going through the wood chipper , ' said one @entity31 commenter ' sadly , @entity73 met an untimely demise ...

temperatures in @entity6 were expected to dip to zero by monday evening , making it likely that any pink ice that remains in the fountain wo n't be melting away any time soon hopes were high on saturday that the @entity3 would break their record streak of seven losing post-season games			2
@entity6 had raced to a 31 - 10 halftime lead against the @entity15 and then took advantage of an interception early in the third quarter to tack on a touchdown that several @entity3 would say later should have sealed the game			2
but a dismal second half performance ended the game with a painful 45 - 44 loss for the @entity3 in @entity118			0
' " attempt " is the key word , ' mocked @entity31 user @entity32			0

@entity6 , @entity29 *employees* put red dye in a fountain that freezes each winter
@entity31 commenters and national news outlets have *joked* that the fountain looks like a ' scene from @entity46 '
the failed attempt at team spirit also became a *bad* omen after the @entity3 ' spectacular *defeat* by the @entity15 on saturday
