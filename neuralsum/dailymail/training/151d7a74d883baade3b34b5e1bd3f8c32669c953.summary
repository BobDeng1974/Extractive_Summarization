by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity2 believes @entity3 are finally getting to grips with the perils of life on the road in the @entity8 after the @entity9 rallied to hold @entity10 to a 2 - 2 draw at @entity12			1
the @entity13 were humbled 3 - 0 on this ground late last season and looked to be heading for further embarrassment on @entity17 after @entity18 and @entity19 gave @entity10 a two - goal lead going into the break			1
but , after @entity23 cut the deficit after 83 minutes , substitute @entity22 headed a late equaliser from @entity27 's cross			1
but @entity39 midfielder @entity2 said : ' we 've learned a lot from last year about playing these kind of teams away and we came back today and tried to be stronger			1
' we did n't give up until the last second so it was a game to remember for us			0
it was a great performance from the team because being 2 - 0 down was not easy for us			2
even though we were losing in the first half we had a few occasions to score so it was a bit unfair for us			0
' hope : @entity23 collects the ball after scoring late to bring the score to 2 - 1 at @entity12 game changer : @entity22 came off the bench to score the equaliser before a late ankle injury meanwhile , @entity37 praised @entity22 for changing the game after coming on as a second - half substitute			1
' we looked much more dangerous ( after @entity22 came on ) , ' the @entity3 manager said			2
' i knew we were dominating the game in the second half and we needed some physical presence up front			0
that presence was very important			0
' he had a very good second half			0
' unfortunately for @entity37 , @entity22 suffered an ankle injury in the dying minutes and could now miss the second leg of @entity3 's @entity72 play - off against @entity74			1
' it is a big game and i hope we have not lost him , ' said @entity37 of @entity22 , who left @entity12 with a protective boot on his left foot			1
' in the final minute he stretched his ankle			0
at the moment it does n't look too good			0
' not fit enough ! @entity33 was withdrawn at half - time after an ineffectual performance @entity33 is likely to lead the line against the @entity87 , who gained a 0 - 0 draw against the @entity9 in @entity90 on wednesday			1
@entity37 said he had no option but to withdraw the £ 35million signing at half - time on saturday			2
' at the moment he is not completely ready physically , ' @entity37 said			2
' he knows he is not at his best physically but when he is his confidence will come back			0
