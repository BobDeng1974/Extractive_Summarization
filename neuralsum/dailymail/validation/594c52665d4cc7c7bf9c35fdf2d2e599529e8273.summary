a 94th - minute goal by substitute @entity1 rescued a @entity3 point for @entity4 in a 1 - 1 draw at home to @entity7 , who looked as though they were going to pull off the classic smash - and - grab			1
the home side had dominated for the vast majority of the contest , only to fall behind 20 minutes from time when @entity15 's shot was deflected past a helpless @entity16 for the opener			1
it was a crushing blow for a @entity4 side that had hit the bar in the first half through @entity22 , had a @entity24 goal chalked off for offside and seen @entity27 fluff a relatively straight - forward heading chance			2
a 94th - minute goal by substitute @entity1 rescued a point for @entity4 against @entity7 but they stuck to their task in the second period , and after @entity35 had denied @entity36 with a stunning stop , the goalkeeper then tipped a @entity24 header on to the bar as well as clawing away a @entity40 effort			1
it looked like time would run out on @entity4 , but in the fourth of five added minutes , @entity1 equalised with a goal that could yet save their season			1
@entity4 had started the game on the front foot , with @entity7 content to play on the break			1
and the visitors showed their threat inside the early exchanges when @entity53 led a breakaway only for @entity55 to save the day in the nick of time			0
@entity4 were getting the ball wide at every opportunity to wingers @entity59 - making his full debut - and @entity36			2
but it was through the middle that they nearly broke the deadlock , with @entity22 's 30 - yard effort beating @entity35 only to hit the bar and come back out			0
the ball fell invitingly for @entity24 , but the striker 's header was weak and straight at @entity35			0
@entity69 : @entity16 , @entity70 ( @entity71 - 78 ) , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity55 , @entity36 ( @entity40 - 67 ) , @entity74 , @entity22 , @entity59 , @entity75 ( @entity76 - 78 ) , @entity24 subs not used : @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 goals : @entity1 90 booked : @entity72 @entity83 : @entity35 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 ( @entity91 - 55 ) , @entity15 ( @entity92 - 82 ) , @entity53 ( @entity93 - 68 ) , @entity94 subs not used : @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 goals : @entity15 70 booked : @entity93 at the other end , @entity15 could not make the most of @entity87 's cross , and the same player was unable to make amends moments later when he fired past the post			1
former @entity4 man @entity94 had a great opportunity to open the scoring on the half - hour mark but his free header from a corner flashed past the upright			2
latics ended the half on a high and should have taken the lead when @entity59 's pinpoint cross found @entity75 , whose header from point - blank was straight at @entity35 when either side would surely have brought about the opening goal			0
@entity4 did have the ball in the net right on half - time through @entity24 , but the striker looked well offside and the flag was up on the far side			2
the home side picked up where they left off after the restart , and a @entity36 free - kick bound for the top corner was superbly clawed out by @entity35			0
@entity36 then had time and space in the box to pick his spot on the edge of the area , but his shot hit @entity24 and was hacked away to safety			0
the visitors won a couple of corners but they were virtually non-existent as an attacking force , with @entity4 asking all the questions			0
but with 20 minutes to go , the unthinkable happened and @entity146 took an undeserved lead in extremely fortuitous circumstances			1
@entity15 's shot from distance took a massive deflection off a defender , completely wrong - footing @entity153 and rolling into the net to the delight of the packed away end behind the goal			0
credit goes to @entity4 for the way they stuck to their task , and @entity35 produced another fabulous stop to deny substitute @entity40 before @entity24 saw a header tipped on to the bar by the goalkeeper			0
it looked as though @entity7 were going to hold on for all three points before , in the fourth added minute , @entity1 sent an overhead kick in off the bar to rescue a point for the hosts .			1

@entity171 fired @entity7 into the lead with just 20 minutes left to play
but @entity1 equalised with just seconds of *injury* time to go
draw with @entity7 leaves @entity4 five points *adrift* of @entity3 safety
@entity7 are now without a *championship* away win in seven matches
