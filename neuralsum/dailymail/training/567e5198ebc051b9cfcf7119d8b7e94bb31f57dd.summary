by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:15 est , 7 january 2013 updated : 07:21 est , 7 january 2013 the @entity4 @entity3 could help form the next government , leader @entity2 claimed today			1
despite not having a single mp in @entity7 , mr @entity2 claimed his party ’s trajectory could mean he plays the role of deciding who becomes prime minister in the event of another hung parliament			1
the extraordinary boast comes as @entity16 tries to see off the electoral threat posed by the @entity19 party with a landmark speech in the @entity21 on @entity23 policy for @entity4 ’s future relationship with @entity25			1
@entity3 leader @entity2 claimed he could help form a coalition in the event of another hung parliament in 2015 tensions have been growing between the conservatives and @entity3 after mr @entity2 ’s party ’s poll ratings soared , reaching 16 per cent in a poll yesterday – up from 4.5 per cent a year ago			1
mr @entity16 yesterday branded @entity3 ' pretty odd people ' in a fresh attack which mr @entity2 had suggested would make an electoral pact before polling day impossible			1
but the @entity3 boss said that if the progress in the polls continues , he could help form the next government if there was another hung parliament			1
‘ do n’t think about @entity3 forming the government in 2015 but if we continue at anything like our current progress , who knows ? ‘ the “ first - past - the - post ” system is brutal to a party like us , we ’ve got a lot of work to do on that and to build up our stronger areas , but who ’s to say that in 2015 @entity3 may well be needed in a coalition ? ’ however , he warned against getting carried away by good poll ratings			1
‘ when @entity59 said to the @entity47 “ go home and prepare for government ” , it made him a laughing stock and people are still laughing at him about that now			2
‘ we ’ve got to keep our feet on the ground			0
we are making progress , we ’re not yet a party that is poised to take government in this country , ' he told @entity67			2
‘ we are a voice for good , ordinary people in this country , we are not hidebound by political correctness , we ’ve proved ourselves to be great campaigners , let ’s see how the @entity3 story evolves			2
’ @entity16 took a swipe at @entity3 supporters , branding them ' pretty odd people ' as former labour minister @entity78 warned putting a question mark over @entity4 's @entity81 membership was ' economically insane ' @entity3 are predicted to win the @entity7 elections in 2014 and beaten both @entity23 and @entity84 candidates in by - elections			1
a @entity87 survey for the @entity88 put @entity89 on 38 per cent , the @entity90 on 29 , @entity3 on 16 and the @entity84 on 11			2
translated into votes at the next general election , that would cost the @entity23 51 seats and present @entity89 with a thumping victory and an overall majority of 94			0
mr @entity16 renewed his attack on @entity3 yesterday , saying it contains some ‘ pretty odd people ’			1
he spoke as a poll suggested that the @entity101 party is enjoying record support , at 16 per cent , taking third place from the @entity84			1
asked yesterday on the @entity67 about his previous description of @entity3 supporters as ‘ fruitcakes , loonies and closet racists ’ , mr @entity16 said : ‘ there are some pretty odd people			1
’ but mr @entity2 hit back : ' do i want a party where we 've got some eccentrics and occasionally someone causes us an embarrassment – or do i want a party made up of a bland lot of ghastly people whose names i do n't even know ? ' i 'm in politics , and i 've never heard of half the mps who come on the telly			2
i meet them at cocktail parties and after 30 minutes i ca n't remember their name , ' he told @entity126			0
the prime minister is expected to give a major speech on repatriating powers from @entity25 in the @entity21 before the end of the month			0
he will rule out the idea of leaving the @entity81 to become a trading partner , like @entity133 , and instead advocate using moves by eurozone countries towards closer integration to bring powers back to @entity137			0
the ' fresh settlement ' would then be put to @entity4 voters in a referendum			0
but today former labour business secretary @entity78 , an @entity141 commissioner , warned the prime minister not to think he can ' " put a gun ' to the heads of @entity81 leaders over repatriating powers			0
in an article for the @entity126 he wrote : ' the prime minister seems to think he can only pacify his party by conceding to @entity149 their long coveted referendum			2
' i think his hopes for buying peace will be disappointed			0
the @entity90 risk dividing into irreconcilable factions , those who want to adjust the terms of @entity4 's @entity81 membership in order to stay in , and those who will do everything they can to get @entity4 out			0
' that 's what happens when madness takes over a political party			0
ask anyone who was in the @entity89 in the 1980s			0
' beginning 2013 by placing this large and indefinite question mark over our membership of the @entity81 , and all the trade and investment privileges it brings us , can only be described as economically insane			0
