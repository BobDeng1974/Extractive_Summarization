@entity0 had just given one of his finest @entity3 performances when he was asked a question that stopped him in his tracks			1
having scored two goals to inspire a 4 - 0 demolition of @entity8 in the @entity9 , @entity0 was soaking up the atmosphere inside @entity11 when @entity12 , the legendary @entity13 striker and emblem of @entity8 , came up to him			1
he congratulated him and then got straight to the point			0
‘ will you come and join us next season , @entity0 ? ’ asked @entity12			1
of course , there was never any chance of @entity36 going to @entity8 , but had he done so it would have been impossible to begrudge him the opportunity			0
those with his quality deserve to perform on the biggest stage and deserve to have trophy cabinets that are full to the brim			0
had he chosen to leave , he could have doubled his collection of 11 major honours			1
if , say , he had joined @entity45 when the chance first arose in 2004 — the same year @entity47 tentatively enquired about him — @entity36 would have lifted the @entity26 trophy three times			0
my only advice to him back then , when @entity45 ramped up their efforts , was to look at the big picture			0
he could have gone to @entity54 and returned with all kinds of medals but when he eventually returned home to @entity3 , how would he have been viewed ? would @entity3 fans have congratulated him ? would they have been happy to see him be successful ? given the rivalry between the clubs , it would have been impossible			1
that ’s why one title with @entity3 would mean more to him than 10 anywhere else			1
ultimately , he was right to stay ; 12 months after that first offer from @entity45 , @entity36 got his hands on the biggest prize of all in @entity68			0
he immortalised himself with his performances that season , most notably in the @entity9 final against @entity72			0
no go : @entity0 was asked by @entity12 when he was going to join the @entity75 giants it could have been so different : @entity45 made a move for @entity0 but he opted to stay at @entity3 @entity79 winner : @entity0 could have won the @entity26 title if he had moved to @entity45 when you think about it , though , his loyalty to @entity3 has been unbelievable			1
had he not come from this city , i do n’t think for one moment he would have stayed , particularly given that @entity3 have n’t been anywhere near the @entity9 for five years			1
i do n’t believe he needs the medal to cement his legacy but if you are a genuine football fan , for everything he has done over the past 15 years , you should want to see him complete his collection			0
there are parallels with his current situation to how it was for @entity97 at @entity47 in the early 1990s , a club captain who had enjoyed great success , led his country with distinction but had found the one honour he craved most of all frustratingly out of reach			1
@entity97 was still @entity47 ’s driving force when they mounted their first real assault on the title in 1991 - 92 , but their quest to end a 25 - year wait was shattered at @entity11 when @entity3 won 2 - 0			1
@entity36 could easily find himself in a similar position on sunday			0
if @entity45 beat @entity108 and @entity3 lose at @entity109 , i feel a 10 - point gap would be too difficult to overhaul , but @entity36 is going into this make - or - break collision playing some of the best football of his career			1
he has been questioned at times this season and there was even a theory @entity3 would be better off without him after they blitzed @entity118 5 - 0 in december , but such talk about a man who has scored in each of the four major cup finals and at two @entity122 was nonsense			1
without any kind of fuss , he has slotted into what has been called ‘ the @entity130 role ’ and dictated @entity3 ’s play , showing his exemplary range of passing			1
it is the latest role he has mastered			0
he is a player who grandfathers will tell their grandchildren about			0
we love foreign players who can star in a variety of positions			0
we hear about how they have been well - schooled but what about @entity36 ? he has thrived as a no 10 , a deep - lying central midfielder , on the right flank or at right back			2
he could even play as a central defender and do n’t forget @entity143 used him on the left for @entity145			1
landing the big one : @entity0 's won the @entity9 with @entity3 in 2005 here to stay : @entity0 speaks with then @entity3 manager @entity146 after committing his future to the club in 2005 following interest from @entity45 silver lining : @entity0 has won every domestic trophy in his time at @entity11 - except the @entity26 there has been talk he will end his international career after the @entity156 but he is still @entity145 ’s first - choice midfielder and i ca n’t see anyone emerging to dislodge him			1
@entity159 and @entity160 are the @entity161 but they are still playing catch - up			2
leading @entity145 to @entity163 is something i know he is very proud of , but nothing would make him prouder than leading @entity3 to a first title since 1990			1
full steam ahead : @entity0 will lead @entity145 in @entity163 the next generation : @entity160 and @entity159 could be the future of @entity145 's midfield after the @entity146 era was over , we both felt our chance to become champions of @entity145 had gone			1
certainly when @entity20 became manager , that feeling was even more acute as we knew it was a new project that would take a while to get going , so to be in this position is not something @entity36 is going to want to let slip			0
captain marvel : @entity97 went years at @entity47 without winning the league title job done : @entity97 finally got his hands on the @entity26 title in 1993 followers of @entity45 and @entity187 will disagree — so , too , will @entity47 fans and @entity189 — but there would be no more romantic end to this season than seeing @entity36 lift the @entity26 trophy at @entity11 on may 11			1
for his quality and loyalty , it would cap a glorious career			2
it was a privilege to be in the @entity199 on wednesday to see the exhilarating battle between @entity201 and @entity202			0
earlier this season , after his colossal display against @entity47 , i said @entity202 had given one of the best performances i ’d seen by a central defender , and had @entity187 managed to get through to the last eight , i would have said the same again			0
@entity210 turn : @entity201 played a big part in @entity213 beating @entity187 on wednesday @entity214 of delight : @entity201 scores at the @entity199 against @entity187 to see him playing with such power , presence and understanding , it reminded me of @entity221 at his best			0
he was like a man playing against boys			2
his signing for £ 6million in 2008 must rate as @entity187 ’s best value - for - money signing of their modern era			2
but it has to be noted that @entity202 was marking a @entity201 who was only playing at 70 - 80 per cent of his maximum			2
you could see him walking around for long periods , protecting himself so he did n’t suffer any further hamstring problems			0
marked man : @entity202 gets to grips with @entity201 dejected : @entity202 reacts after his team 's defeat in @entity213 when @entity201 came alive , though , he was a joy to watch			2
he was always aware of what was going on around him and he produced six or seven pieces of play that took the breath away			0
when he got the chance to finish the tie , there was never a sense he would miss. we must all hope that @entity201 does not get plagued by hamstring trouble because he could light up the @entity156 this summer			2
if he produces in @entity163 what we have seen him do for @entity213 , @entity248 will have an outstanding chance of winning their first title since 1986			0
what ’s more , if @entity201 peaks in june and july , we ’ll be talking about the greatest player of all time			0
a fortnight has flown by since my last column and once again i ’ve had plenty of things to keep me busy			2
1 dinner with @entity263 - it was good to catch up with my old manager in @entity213			2
he ’d been to watch @entity187 ’s @entity9 game and , after i ’d finished my duties with @entity268 , we had a bite to eat			0
he is relishing going to the @entity156			0
good catch up : @entity271 went for dinner with his former manager @entity263 in @entity213 2 watching some authentic football - marine , who play in the @entity276 , are based not too far from where i live and last weekend i took my son , @entity278 , to see them play @entity280			2
@entity281 lost 1 - 0 but it was an enjoyable game and we will go again			0
3 starting a new playing career - it was good to be involved in the ‘ @entity286 ’ with a host of stars 10 days ago in @entity289 but earlier this week i stepped on to the five - a - side court for the first time			1
it certainly got the old legs moving ! @entity210 turnout : @entity271 joined @entity295 , @entity296 , @entity297 and a many more stars in the @entity299 4 tuning into the @entity301 - i ’ve become more interested in rugby union since my visit to @entity304 last month and the action this afternoon promises to be riveting			0
fingers crossed @entity145 get the convincing win they need to become champions			1
final chance : @entity310 and @entity145 go into their final game with @entity312 with a chance of winning the @entity301 5 waiting for the @entity314 - i will be at @entity109 to see if @entity47 can retrieve a difficult situation against @entity316 and that will evoke some memories			1
@entity3 , of course , needed a dramatic victory against the @entity322 side on the way to the @entity9 final in 2005			1
can @entity47 do the same ? you beauty : @entity0 celebrates scoring for @entity3 against @entity316 in 2004 to earn a 3 - 1 win			1

@entity3 man has had plenty of chances to leave @entity11 but stayed loyal
@entity0 could end @entity145 career this summer - but who will *replace* him ?
if he did not come from @entity3 he would have left the club ages ago
