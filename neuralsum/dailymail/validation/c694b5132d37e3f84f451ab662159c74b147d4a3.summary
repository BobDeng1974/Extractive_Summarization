the @entity1 government has made a bizarre internet gaffe by posting a @entity6 @entity5 extremist ’s photograph of veiled women calling for sharia law , citing it as an inspirational example of free speech in the @entity11			1
the @entity13 ’s ‘ @entity14 ’ campaign is designed to dissuade @entity15 from joining @entity16 – also known as @entity17 – and other extreme groups			2
the campaign posted the picture on its @entity22 account last week , adding : ‘ in open societies , all faiths enjoy freedom of speech ; under @entity17 rule , no such thing as freedom of expression			1
they are standing behind a trestle table covered in leaflets and a banner reading : ‘ shariah law or man made law			0
which is better for mankind ? ’ an investigation by @entity48 has found the banner was used in an extremist campaign called @entity5 , do n’t vote , which calls for strict sharia law to be imposed on @entity6 , as well as urging @entity15 not to vote in elections			1
the photo was given the caption ‘ muslims coming out inviting society to @entity57 ’ – which was copied by the @entity13 – by a man calling himself @entity59 , whose @entity22 account is suspended			1
blunder : @entity62 , who posted the image online , was one of 12 islamists given @entity65 banning them from taking part in demonstrations the @entity48 can reveal he is @entity62 , a 33 - year - old from @entity69 , who last year was one of 12 islamists given @entity65 banning them from taking part in demonstrations over a violent protest rally on @entity73			2
at least two of the gang are believed to be fighting for is in @entity76			0
@entity77 – the hate preacher who has repeatedly blamed @entity6 foreign policy for terrorist attacks and whose @entity81 group was banned by the government – was present at the event in @entity35 on march 7			2
he has also given talks in @entity85 and @entity86 at demonstrations where the sign was used			0
the photo appropriated by the @entity13 was first placed on @entity22 last week by a woman calling herself @entity91 , who is a leading figure in the anti-democracy campaign			1
she described it as an ‘ @entity57 roadshow ’ and included the slogan ‘ stay @entity5 , do n’t vote ’ when she put the photo on @entity22			0
yesterday she posted a picture of another sign with the message : ‘ the right of legislation belongs to none but @entity103 ! ’ last night , terror expert @entity105 , associate director of the @entity107 think - tank , said : ‘ it ’s an incredibly weak “ fail ” , ’ he said			0
‘ they should be putting a bit more thought into their sourcing			0
with all of our resources , it ’s not even as accomplished as the crudest is propaganda			0
’ @entity1 @entity22 users were also quick to ridicule the @entity13 , with one calling it an ‘ epic fail ’			1
conservative @entity1 commentator @entity120 added : ‘ why is the @entity13 promoting sharia for the @entity6 ? are n’t they supposed to uphold the @entity122 of the @entity1 ? @entity123 ’s incompatible with that constitution , as it is with the legal inheritance of @entity127 civilisation			1
’ the @entity13 did not respond to requests to comment yesterday .			0
