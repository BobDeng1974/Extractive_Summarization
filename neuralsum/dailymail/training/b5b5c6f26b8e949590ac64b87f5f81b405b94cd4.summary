mother @entity26 told the @entity27 : ' i have two sons aged nine and six who both attend the school and my eldest immediately noticed it before i did and was very inquisitive about it , which broke my heart			2
' i 've been worried all day about how this may affect his school day or god - forbid , any conflict in the playground as children can be unintentionally very spiteful , especially when discussing things they do n't have the mental capacity to understand			2
' according to headteacher @entity47 , other messages appeared along the same stretch of road			1

' many children and parents have been upset by this graffiti and how it still remains on the school path beggars belief , particularly when parents have been very vocal to school staff about their concerns			1
