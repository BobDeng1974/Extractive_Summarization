rap music and @entity3 women ... they are not four words that usually come together			1
but two women from @entity6 are breaking down the boundaries for @entity9 females across the world with their brand of inspirational hip hop			1
together , @entity13 , 34 , and @entity14 , 33 , form @entity15 - a self - described ' hiphop hijabis ' duo that has created a new type of rap music for the masses that addresses religion , gender and issues of identity			1
since then , they have cultivated a global fan base of devoted followers from both inside and outside the @entity9 community			1
the attraction for their followers is , in part , the unlikely partnership between the fact that they are @entity3 women who have an impressive ability to write and perform verse			1
@entity14 and @entity13 converted to @entity9 ten years ago , just three weeks before the 7/7 bombings , and while the path has n't always been easy , they have n't looked back			1
they met at school in @entity28 and first became friends while performing in a gospel choir , but only decided to form a group after moving to the capital to study at university			0
a few years later , they decided to convert to @entity9 after learning about the religion through the autobiography of @entity58 and academic books about @entity9 and @entity60			1
@entity13 and @entity14 formed their rap group ten years ago like most other female @entity3 , they now pray five times a day , avoid alcohol and wear the hijab			1
the marriage of their religion and their profession has both inspired and upset many people though			0
@entity14 told @entity72 : ' there are people who have messaged us from all over the world who are appreciative of the bravery in our character			1
' but on the flip - side there are people who have been unappreciative from both the @entity3 community and the non-muslim community			1
' people who have suggested were using our hijabs as a gimmick to make money and that we are n't @entity3 at all			1
' then there are people who are really derogatory			0
in the opening lines of the @entity95 documentary we did recently , i rapped about being taken from @entity97 as a slave to the @entity99 in the opening scene			0
' i got comments like " you should be grateful that we colonised you , otherwise @entity97 would still be in mud huts			0
" ' it 's the nature of our technological society though , you get a lot of trolling			0
' the duo 's lyrics are based around feminism , @entity9 and political issues to say that the woman have cornered a niche in the market is an understatement - their lyrics are based around feminism , @entity9 and political issues			1
@entity14 said : ' we talk about political situations but we try and take a different stance			1
' for instance , with something like the @entity124 issue we talk about someone who has lost a husband or someone who is a mother			2
' so we talk about it from a female perspective			1
' at first , the women had a difficult time convincing the @entity3 community that they should be onstage rapping			2
but in the last ten years , they have turned the prejudice around			0
@entity14 said : ' in the @entity3 community it was very difficult because the topic of hip hop is very flammable			1
it 's everything that can be wrong with the world - drugs , violence and everything			0
' parts of the @entity133 do find it very difficult			0
' people have approached my husband and asked " why do you allow your wife to do this ? why do you allow your wife onstage ? i would never let my wife go onstage , i would never let my wife travel without me			0
" ' he 's a rapper as well , he 's in a band called @entity155 and he has always known me as a rapper , so for us there has never been even a consideration that this should n't happen			2
' but that is hard for people to understand			0
' but in the last few years people have come to understand that it is a very positive thing and we have been asked to speak on panels at conferences on @entity9			2
' the pair have released an album called the @entity170 while there may have been problems with the way the women have been received , the reaction has been overwhelmingly positive overall			2
one of the biggest surprises for the women was how wide their fan base was when they started			0
@entity14 said : ' when we first converted to @entity9 we though tour main following would be young @entity3 girls from @entity184			1
' but at that time it was the beginning of @entity186 - it was the first independent platform to put your music online - and some comments we got from people blew our minds			0
' we had amazing comments from people like a middle aged white guy from @entity195 or a couple from @entity197			0
' it was n't just people from the @entity3 community			2
' it is hard to put it into a box , we represent the voice of women , the voice of black people and the voice of people from @entity9			2
' and with a huge surge in interest into their music over the last few months , their popularity is only going to grow			0
@entity14 said : ' some of the reaction we 've had from people is amazing - we ca n't get our heads around the attention we 've got			2
' @entity221 is not a story of sorrow , we are not women wounded , rather we have found strength in what may seem strange to overs and we would n't have it any other way			0

@entity13 and @entity14 are female @entity3 rappers
the pair , who are called @entity15 , rap about feminism and @entity9
they talk to @entity72 about the fans of their music and prejudices they face
