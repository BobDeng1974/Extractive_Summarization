by @entity0 published : 16:34 est , 22 october 2012 updated : 03:47 est , 23 october 2012 as he splashed into a pond full of geese , this hungry fox no doubt thought he was in for an easy lunch			1
but he had chosen the wrong flock for that			1
the brave birds banded together – and outfoxed him			1
the @entity10 geese even recruited passing ducks , coots , moorhens and cormorants for their cunning plan			1
outnumbered : as the fox wades through the water looking for an easy meal , the geese surround him they ganged up on the would - be predator to prevent him picking them off one by one and followed him along the pond			1
eventually , the fox gave up and returned to dry land still hungry and probably rather baffled			2
the encounter was photographed by a visitor at the @entity30 in @entity31 , south - west @entity32			1
safety in numbers : other birds join in to defend themselves and their offspring a spokesman for the centre said : ‘ they will be used to seeing foxes and have developed strategies to deal with their presence and protect themselves			2
it is typical behaviour in the wild but rarely seen			2
’ @entity48 , of the @entity49 , said it was an example of ‘ mobbing ’ , a form of behaviour that birds engage in to defend themselves or their offspring from predators			2
they aim to divert a predator ’s attention through their behaviour and to blow its cover , thus reducing its chances of success			0
better luck next time : defeated , the fox begins slink away although more commonly associated with crows and gulls swooping in flight at their target , it is common among many species of birds and can take place on land or on water			0
mr @entity48 said : ‘ it ’s instinctive behaviour			0
at first , the birds will have acted out of fear for their young , but they will have become emboldened by the number of birds that were there and acted as a group			0
‘ normally mobbing involves one species			0
what is quite unusual here is that they are all joining together to defend themselves against a fox coming into their patch – it ’s like an avian @entity95			0
they are being intimidating by patrolling up and down wherever the fox goes			0
