as death - defying stunts go , hurling yourself off a 60 - foot high platform on the back of the horse into just 12 feet of water must surely be up there with one of the most insane			1
but back in 1920s @entity8 , launching a horse off a platform almost twice the height of a 10 metre @entity13 diving board was a daily occurrence			1
what 's more , the ability to do it well could win you fame			0
diving horse arrived on the pier in the 1920s , having become a fixture of travelling circuses previously			1
it would go on to become the star attraction at @entity36 , with crowds gathering to marvel at the dangerous feat as the horse flew off the end of 40 and 60 foot platforms			1
@entity50 , who dove horses from 1928 until 1935 , throwing herself off the platform two to six times a day , told the @entity54 in 2008 : ' we were the stars of the @entity56			2
' everybody had to see the diving horse			2
that was what everybody remembered			0
' we were a class act			0
' glamorous : the rider would don a swimming costume before jumping the horse off the platform safe : those who dove horses maintain it was safe - with only a few broken bones a year well - kept : horse diver @entity50 said the animals ' lived the life of @entity74 ' and it was not cruel mrs @entity50 's sister @entity76 was arguably the best - known of the horse divers , whose story was immortalized in the 1991 @entity80 film @entity81			1
she took her first dive aged just 15 , in 1923 , and became one of the best in the business			0
but in 1931 , her career could have come to a premature end , when she was blinded after a knock to the head which detached her retinas			0
ms @entity76 was not about to stop , however : she dove horses for another 11 years , while unable to see			0
fame : the best - known horse diver was @entity76 , who had a @entity80 film made about her life history : amazingly , you could still see horse diving as recently as 1978 the trick to surviving the falls , according to those in the know , was to tuck your head down one side as the horse plunged towards the water below			1
it is claimed the riders only suffered a few broken bones each year , while mrs @entity110 told the @entity54 the horses were so well looked after they ' lived the life of @entity74 '			0
however , despite animal protection officers were concerned about the act , it continued until 1978 - when the pier had fallen into such a state of disrepair it had to be shut .			2
