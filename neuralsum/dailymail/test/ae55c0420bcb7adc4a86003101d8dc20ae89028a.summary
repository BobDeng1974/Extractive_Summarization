the family of a 19 - month - old girl with a seven kilogram cancerous tumour in her belly are desperately searching for specialists who may have the answer to removing the treatment - resistant growth			1
@entity7 was diagnosed with stage three neuroblastoma cancer in december last year , after a specialist at @entity11 's @entity10 discovered the football - sized tumour , which weighs more than half her body weight , growing around her vital organs and pressing against her spine			1
@entity17 , from @entity18 in north western @entity19 , had been misdiagnosed with scoliosis when she was three months old , but her aunt , @entity21 , said that @entity17 's mother knew something more was wrong when the toddler 's stomach began to swell			2
@entity7 was diagnosed with stage three neuroblastoma cancer in december last year ' her mother @entity27 kept saying to the doctor that it was n't scoliosis			1
she was pale and not eating , and vomiting up her food , so she kept looking for a second opinion , ' ms @entity21 , 25 , told @entity33			0
in december last year , twelve months after @entity17 was originally diagnosed with scoliosis , the family was given the devastating news that she had stage three neuroblastoma cancer			1
' i just do n't think her parents had prepared themselves for the news			0
even when she was having tests , i do n't think they let themselves believe it , ' ms @entity21 said			0
the tumour had wrapped itself around her organs and up her spine to near her heart , and was releasing huge amounts of adrenaline , which meant that the toddler needed to be put on heart medication to balance her racing heartbeat of 200 beats per minute			1
@entity17 was admitted to hospital immediately , and began chemotherapy treatment on the huge tumour , in the hope that it would shrink to a size which could be operated on			1
' the oncologist said to us that he was hopeful that after four rounds of chemotherapy it would be able to be removed			1
while we were waiting for the rounds @entity17 got quite sick and contracted a staph infection , ' ms @entity21 said			2
the seven kilogram tumour is pressing against her spine and vital organs causing her swollen stomach @entity17 's aunt @entity21 is seeking treatment for her niece in the @entity73 @entity17 had four rounds of chemotherapy which her oncologist had hoped would shrink the tumour ' it 's been quite a battle for the poor little thing			1
' @entity17 and @entity27 , a single mother , have been staying in @entity80 while the rest of their family lives several hours away in country @entity19			2
a day before her last chemotherapy treatment , @entity17 's mother @entity27 gave birth to her second child , @entity88 , and just two week later , was told that the chemotherapy had n't been successful in reducing the tumour to an operable size			1
' we were told that the chemotherapy had been ineffective because the tumour had developed a protective barrier which meant it was immune			1
they also could n't put her into radiation therapy because of how close it is to her organs , ' said ms @entity21			2
@entity17 's extended family have now begun reaching out to specialists overseas in the hope that there may be treatment available in the @entity73 that is not available in @entity107			1
a day before @entity17 's last chemotherapy treatment , her mother gave birth to her little sister @entity88 ms @entity112 said that @entity17 's mother has been very strong even through the delivery of @entity115 ( right ) her oncologist has also continued to seek advice , and the family is hopeful that a solution will be found to buy some more time for the ' fun - loving ' little girl			1
' she 's a cracker of a child , despite her pale skin and overly large stomach you would n't pick that she has something wrong with her , ' said ms @entity21			0
' she 's very carefree and runs wild like any other child , she 's a very happy little girl			0
' however , it has been a month since @entity17 's last treatment , and her aunt said she is beginning to experience more pain as her condition worsens			2
' she 's been eating less and ca n't walk for more than a few metres before she falls over in pain , crying , ' ms @entity21 said			2
' we found out this week that this is because the tumour is pushing on her spinal cord and catching the nerves there , ' she said			1
' sometimes when i look into her eyes it 's like she knows something is really wong			0
' ms @entity112 said that the family and @entity17 's oncologist are n't giving up hope , and that they are determined to keep searching for a solution			2

' but he ca n't promise anything and so both he and our family are talking to overseas specialists about the next step			0
' ms @entity112 has set up a @entity172 page to raise money to help @entity17 and her mother fly to the @entity73 to seek treatment not available in @entity107			1
