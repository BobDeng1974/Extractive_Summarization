the @entity0 made an embarrassing blunder this afternoon after announcing that the former @entity3 prime minister @entity2 had died after suffering a strike instead of a stroke			2
an update on the mobile website of @entity8 wrongly stated that she had been killed by a form of industrial action			1
it read : ' reaction as former @entity14 prime minister @entity2 dies following a strike			2
' embarrassing : the @entity0 made a blunder this afternoon after announcing that the former @entity3 prime minister @entity2 had died after suffering a strike instead of a stroke in reality she suffered a stroke and passed away at the age of 87			2
the gaffe was spotted by the @ @entity26 account , which sarcastically tweeted : ' well done , @entity0			2
' the post has been retweeted more than 800 times and received nearly 150 favourites			0
in response to the mistake a @entity0 spokesperson said : ' this was an error which was quickly corrected			1
' the error provoked amusement on the internet with one @entity26 user calling the gaffe ' the most ironic typo ever , ' while another questioned ' most inappropriate typo ever ? ' when @entity2 came to power in may 1979 , it was at the end of the infamous @entity46 , where @entity14 was crippled by a wave of national strikes			1
mistake : an update on the mobile website of @entity8 wrongly stated that the former prime minister had been killed by a bout of industrial action			1
right , a 1984 photo showing police taking action as violence flares with miners at @entity59 in @entity60 @entity61 , named because of her strong will , spent the next decade curbing the power of trade unions , signalling the end of an era when trade union leaders trooped in and out of 10 @entity68 , haggling and bargaining with her @entity71 predecessors			1
instead she stripped the unions of many of their powers with the aim of transferring them to management and individual consumers			0
mrs @entity2 successfully defied @entity82 's nationwide and year - long miners ' strike , which threatened to cripple @entity14 's entire economy			0
and as she transformed the nation - attempting to release the grip of the state on massive industries and public services alike - she became one of the most influential , talked - about , listened - to and dominant statesmen of the western world			0
other criticism leveled at the corporation was when viewers noticed that news anchors were not wearing black ties			0
presenter @entity97 was not wearing a dark tie fronting the @entity2 special on @entity100			0
one @entity26 user wrote : ' would it be too much for the @entity8 readers to put on a black tie and show some respect ! ? ! ' while another wrote : ' no black tie for @entity100 presenter ? surprising			1
' it is thought that the corporation 's staff are only obliged to wear a black tie when a death occurs which they class as a category one - such as the @entity117 .			0

the update was seen on the mobile website of @entity8
wrongly stated that the @entity122 had been killed by industrial action
