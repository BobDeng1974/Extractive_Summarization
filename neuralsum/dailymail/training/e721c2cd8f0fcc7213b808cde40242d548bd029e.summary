by @entity1 reporter published : 07:26 est , 23 may 2012 updated : 10:37 est , 23 may 2012 ordeal : @entity3 believes her cervical cancer could have been caught sooner if she had been allowed a smear test a cancer sufferer aged just 22 who became one of the youngest women in the country to have a hysterectomy has hit out at the @entity12 for not giving her a smear test which she believes could have saved her fertility			1
@entity3 faces an early menopause , chemotherapy and radiotherapy after having her womb removed following the devastating diagnosis earlier this year			1
now @entity3 , who became one of @entity22 's youngest ever hysterectomy patients when she underwent the gruelling in march , believes she would not necessarily have faced infertility if she had been legally allowed to have a smear test to spot her cervical cancer			1
the former air hostess , who is coming to terms with being unable to bear children and going through the menopause before her mother , said if she had been given a smear test at age 20 her cancer could have been treated in its very early stages			1
the age at which women in @entity36 are offered regular smear tests is 25 even though the rest of the @entity22 offers screening at 20			2
the screening age was only increased from 20 to 25 in 2003 as health bosses claimed it did more harm than good in younger women			2
doctors missed several opportunities to diagnose @entity3 ’s cancer and she was left suffering symptoms for months before the 3.5cm tumour was eventually found			1
despite initially being hopeful the cancer could be removed through fertility - preserving surgery , she was later told she would need a radical hysterectomy , then chemo and radiotherapy			2
she now faces a race against time to harvest her eggs before she begins treatment in the hope that she and her boyfriend of six months @entity59 will someday be able to have a child			0
@entity3 said : ' i should n’t be in this position			2
my cancer had been growing for as long as 18 months before it was discovered			0
if i had been given a smear test at the age of 20 , it would have been pre-cancerous and they would have caught it in time			1
' i feel like my future has been destroyed and i have been forced to rethink everything			0
@entity59 and i have only been together for six months and now he may be my only hope to have children			0
' @entity3 first experienced symptoms in january last year when she started to suffer abdominal pains but it was only when the pain became unbearable in july that she went to @entity81 ’s @entity80 department to seek help			1
pretty in pink : @entity3 , pictured here on her 18th birthday , had her cervical cancer dismissed as ' women 's troubles ' and cervical erosion before medics gave her the diagnosis there she was brushed off and told she was suffering from ‘ women ’s troubles ’			1
@entity3 was so concerned by the pains she visited her gp a few weeks later and after a brief external examination was told it could be gall bladder infection but was probably nothing to worry about			1
cervical cancer symptoms do not always present all at once so when the pain went away on its own , @entity3 decided to take the doctors ’ advice not to worry			1
however , in november , she started her relationship with @entity59 , 23 , and experienced more pain when their relationship became physical			0
but when she returned to her gp after suffering bleeding , there was still no mention of a smear test - with doctors instead recommending she be tested for sexually transmitted infections			1
@entity3 said : ' i was n’t very happy about that , i felt like she was assuming i had been sleeping around even though before i got together with @entity59 i had n’t been in a relationship with anyone for over a year			1
' like a lot of girls , i had lost my virginity at 16 but i was responsible and i had been suffering from stomach cramps for the last year			0
i knew it could n’t be that but i agreed to the tests anyway			0
' the nurse explained to me that it would be just like a smear test but i had to say to her that i had never had one because i was only 20 so i was n’t allowed one			1
' at no point did it occur to anyone to offer me a smear test			1
' @entity3 began bleeding while the swabs were being taken and from the look on the nurse ’s face , she says , she knew there was something wrong			2
@entity3 , pictured at a charity prom earlier this year with boyfriend @entity59 , 23 , has had to come to terms with not being able to bear children the doctor was called in and it was agreed that @entity3 would be referred to a gynaecologist			1
but , she says , she was assured it was unlikely there was anything wrong because of her young age			0
the doctor and gynaecologist were convinced @entity3 was likely to be suffering from a condition called cervical erosion which can cause bleeding in between periods			1
however a colposcopy and biopsy revealed the worst possible truth			0
@entity3 ’s test results came back as positive for cancer			1
she said : ' once someone tells you that you have cancer your whole world stops right there			0
' i could n’t take in anything else the doctor said after that			0
i felt dizzy and sick for the rest of the day , it just would n’t sink in			0
' following an mri scan @entity3 was told that she may be able to have a trachelectomy , an operation that would remove the affected part of her cervix and then repair it to give her a good chance of being able to have children in future			2
but on closer inspection of the scan results it was decided the tumour was too large to treat in this way and a radical hysterectomy would be necessary			0
her tumour had been graded @entity184 - i meaning it was less than 4cm in size and at stage one			0
she added : ' my womb would be removed so i would never be able to carry children of my own but it would mean i would still have my ovaries so i would n’t go through the menopause and i might someday be able to use my eggs in @entity193 and have children through a surrogate			0
' until then i had never really given my fertility much thought			0
i was studying at night to become a nurse and i was concentrating on my career but i had always imagined that i would have a family someday			0
' now i was being forced to think about the future and how it was n’t going to pan out the way i imagined			0
' @entity3 underwent the four - and - a - half hour operation in march at @entity203 during which her lymph nodes were removed to be tested to see if the cancer had spread			1
constant reminder : @entity3 shows the scar running up her naval on the day she underwent the hysterectomy operation in march this year but two weeks later she received the news she had been dreading - that the cancer had advanced to her lymph nodes and blood vessels , meaning five weeks of chemotherapy and radiotherapy which would rob her of her fertility			1
@entity3 said : ' i was devastated			2
i was going to have to watch all my friends have children and my sister who already has a child bringing their families into the world and i would never be able to do the same			0
' the treatment was supposed to start in three weeks and it would take at least four to harvest my eggs			0
the cancer specialist told me not to hold my breath if i wanted to get funding but that they would delay the treatment for an extra week			0
' now @entity3 is in a race against time to harvest enough eggs to create a few embryos with her partner @entity59 that will be frozen for the future			2
family fear : @entity3 , pictured right with her mother @entity237 and half - sister @entity238 , 20 , has battled through the procedure with family support even though the young couple have not been together long , @entity59 agreed to the procedure which would give @entity3 ’s eggs a greater chance of survival			2
even if the @entity193 is successful , there is only a 32 per cent chance the embryos will take once they are reimplanted			0
@entity3 ’s half sister @entity249 , 30 , is at high risk for cervical cancer and receives a smear test every six months			1
but despite the family history , @entity3 ’s other sister @entity238 , 20 , was told she was not eligible to have a test when she visited the doctor to ask for one			1
as a young mum , @entity238 is at higher risk of cervical cancer too			1
happier times : pictured in july last year before a holiday with four friends , @entity3 had no idea what heartbreak lay ahead of her @entity3 said : ' i ’m dreading the chemo and i ’m trying not to think about how much it will make me sick			2
mostly i am terrified of lymphoedema which is one of the common side effects of the drugs they use			0
' i ’m also scared of going through the menopause as even my mum has n’t gone through it yet and i do n’t know what to expect			0
@entity3 is part of a campaign to have the age limit lowered and says she is proof that women are being overlooked by the law			2
the @entity282 , set up in memory of the woman by the same name who died of cervical cancer aged 23 , recently presented a 122,600 - signature petition to @entity289 asking to have the age limit for smear tests lowered .			1

@entity3 diagnosed with cervical cancer over a year after reporting pains to her gp
she was dismissed as having ' women 's troubles ' and ' cervical erosion ' before cancer was finally spotted
@entity3 believes cancer could have been caught if she had been allowed smear test earlier
