fast food chain @entity0 may only have outlets in five states but its reputation for fine hamburgers is known throughout the land			1

' @entity21 ' burgers : in - @entity23 employees wo n't admit to its existence , but that does n't have to stop you from simply creating your own inspired by chat on @entity30 about the emergence of a new ' @entity21 ' burger , the food blog @entity28 took a trip to an @entity0 to see what all the fuss was about			1
the ' @entity21 ' burger is a hamburger but with addition of a portion of ' @entity42 ' fries ( that 's french fries covered with spread , cheese and grilled onions ) sitting alongside the patty in between the buns			1
the @entity28 crew could n't get an @entity0 employee to admit on camera to the existence of the ' @entity21 ' burger , but that did n't stop them from simply creating there own			1
earlier this year a chef at an @entity0 revealed some of the secret food experiments that go on in the kitchen after the last customers has left			2

the restrictive menu has n’t stopped @entity0 chefs from experimenting after hours , coming up with their own combinations and adding other foods to the mix including bacon			0
‘ took bacon in to cook after closing and it really changes everything , ’ raved dravila9 , the username of an @entity95 chef who posted his revelations on the ‘ @entity98 ’ forum on @entity98			0
‘ @entity108 it was the greatest thing i 've ever had ! ’ he said of his bacon burger and animal fries topped with torn up burger patties and bacon , smothered in @entity106 's bbq sauce			1

however dravila9 reserved his biggest praise for an item that only gets served at the company 's annual family picnics - chili dogs			0
‘ omg if @entity0 sold the chili dogs they give at the family picnics the world really would n't be able to handle it , ’ he wrote			2
unfortunately these delicious sounding delights are unlikely to be available to eat any time soon			0
the company ’s menu has barely changed since the chain was launched 65 years old in @entity151			2
the company already has a ' secret menu ' , which it actually publicizes it on the company ’s website and includes the ‘ @entity157 , which is a burger wrapped in crisp @entity160 lettuce instead of a bun , ‘ @entity162 , ’ which has grilled onions , pickles and cheese piled on top of @entity15 fries			2
healthy option : this ' @entity169 , which wraps the burger in crisp @entity160 lettuce rather than a bun , is available on the secret menu another noteworthy non-menu item is the ‘ @entity0 , ’ a creamy blend of chocolate , vanilla and strawberry ice cream			0
experts have attributed much of the chains success to the fact that it has focused on producing a limited number of items very well and has n’t expanded to include chicken or fish products or launch a breakfast menu			0
