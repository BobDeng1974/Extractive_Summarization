we are starting to plan the next move for @entity2 and there are exciting times ahead with a number of options on the table			1
i sat down with @entity9 last week and i am confident he will fight @entity2 sooner or later			1
the question at the moment is when			0
as you know , he is the mandatory for @entity2 ’s @entity15 super-middleweight world title and @entity2 must fight him by the end of february			1
@entity2 ’s preferred option is @entity18 in @entity19 in november or december , but i do n’t think that is going to happen			1
that leaves @entity9 and @entity38 as the realistic options for the end of 2014			0
@entity41 would be a great fight but we also know the value of a big domestic dust up			2
@entity2 is just back from a well - deserved family holiday and is in training for the @entity48 1 show ‘ tumble ’			1
the media requests are still coming thick and fast - surely he is a front runner for the @entity51			0
at this point in his career , he has to select the fight that makes the blood pump and gets you out of bed at the crack of dawn for those tough hill runs			2
money as always will be a factor but @entity2 more than most is driven by the competition and his desire to leave a legacy in the sport			1
i think @entity9 would be a huge fight			2
it is a domestic fight between a legend of the sport and an @entity73 champion who is looking to make history and become the first @entity76 gold medalist to go on and win a world title			1
i think that a fight with @entity2 and @entity9 could be made either this winter , in november or december , or possibly in the @entity79			1
as i said , it is all in @entity2 ’s court but what i do know about him is that he will not willingly vacate a title			1
he worked hard for his titles , he wo n’t just give them up			0
if a fight with @entity2 does n’t happen this winter , i will look to get @entity9 a big fight at the @entity89 on october 11 but all roads lead to @entity2			1
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
. i ’m a big believer that everything happens for a reason and @entity93 cruelly missing out on an @entity73 place has turned him , in my opinion , into one of the hottest prospects in world boxing			1
his technique , attitude , skill and power continues to amaze me			0
he lost in the final qualification tournament in @entity105 in a poor decision in a semi-final fight that would have sealed it			2
but look what he is doing in the professional ranks now			0
i am convinced he is going to go on to become one of @entity76 ’s great world champions people say i overhype him or put too much expectation on him			1
for a start i know he can handle it			0
and also i know how special this guy is			0
he fights again on my july 12 bill in @entity120 in a @entity122 international super-middleweight title fight and i have a blueprint in mind for getting him to the top			1
i have never doubted that he can do it			0
my dad watched his debut fight and afterwards he said to me that he had never seen a debut like it			2
belt up : @entity93 celebrates after his victory over @entity132 in february after 11 professional fights and nine knockouts i already think he could handle himself against the world champions at super-middleweight			1
i ’ve seen him spar @entity2 and many others - the kid is a class act			1
he is a beast at the weight – his back is huge – and one day i am sure he will be a light - heavyweight world champion as well			2
before that , he has to come through his fight against @entity144 in @entity120 and then i will continue to move up the world rankings in september or october			1
realistically , i believe he is 12 to 18 months from a world title shot			1
his progress warrants that kind of plan but he has to keep winning			0
he has reached this title level even quicker than @entity151 and @entity152 , who are both blasting their way through			2
but @entity93 has already reached 11 fights , is charging up the rankings and the @entity122 love him			2
the building process starts now			0
too many quality fighters are promoted poorly on the way up and when they get there , they do n’t get the chance to capitalise on it financially			0
i want him to not only have big fights but fight for millions			2
he is good enough , exciting enough and has real pay - per - view potential			0
@entity165 and @entity166 also have fights on july 12			1
neither man can afford a slip up on the night as their rematch later in the year will be a classic			1
the fingers will be crossed this saturday hoping they come through against two big bangers and then we can start planning for a huge domestic clash			0
the warm - up : @entity165 and @entity166 also have fights on july 12 ... and neither can slip up i ’m in the process of drawing up a plan for @entity181 after his defeat in a @entity122 world title eliminator against @entity184			1
it was a devastating loss and i know @entity186 is gutted			2
one thing i can say with certainty is that no - one is giving up on @entity186			0
he proved his commitment by coming south of the border to prepare and he is as hungry as any fighter			0
but we will have to review some things , such as whether he is comfortable at the weight			0
he is having a holiday at the moment but when he is back i will take him to see our nutritionist and we will see if it is time for him to move from lightweight to light - welterweight			0
go again : nobody is giving up on @entity204 , despite some devastating defeats defeated : @entity184 ( right ) wins the @entity207 title over against @entity181 ( left ) i have seen him spar at 10st 3lbs and look absolutely ferocious			1
then , when he comes down to 9st 9lbs he looks a little too frail			0
that is definitely something we will look at it			0
next up i will put him out on september 13 in @entity212 in an eight or 10 - round contest			0
we are going to rebuild his confidence and down the line we will consider where we go			0
it looks like @entity218 might be getting his licence back - that ’s a fight @entity221 would embrace ! after all the waiting we have a date and venue for @entity225 ’s world title shot against @entity226			1
he will fight on august 16 at the @entity228 in @entity229 , @entity230			0
it ’s a great venue for @entity225 to finally win the world title he has been working so hard for			1
video @entity2 v @entity233 highlights			2

the @entity76 pair should fight for @entity2 *'s* @entity15 super-middleweight world title by february
@entity2 ’s preferred option is @entity18 , but that is unlikely
@entity93 cruelly missing out on an @entity73 place has turned him into one of the hottest prospects in world @entity247 is giving up on *scotsman* @entity181 , despite devastating defeats
@entity165 and @entity166 ca *n't* afford slip ups before their bout later this year
