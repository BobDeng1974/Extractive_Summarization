by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 04:18 est , 28 september 2012 updated : 08:26 est , 28 september 2012 @entity2 has cut ties with his boyhood team @entity4 - pocketing a deal worth up to £ 60million in a move to the rival @entity4 team			1
the @entity10 racing superstar will replace the retiring legend @entity11 next season in a deal that will make him one of the sport 's richest stars			1
it will bring to an end the @entity19 ’s 14 - year association with @entity4 , the team who sponsored him from when he was a 13 - year - old karting prodigy			1
' it is now time for me to take on a fresh challenge and i am very excited to begin a new chapter , ' he said			1
' together , we can grow and rise to this new challenge , ' the 27 - year - old @entity2 added			1
' i believe that i can help steer the @entity36 to the top and achieve our joint ambitions of winning the world championships			0
' january 7 1985 : born in @entity40 to parents @entity42 and @entity2 - who split up two years later 1991 : has his first ride in a go - kart on holiday in @entity47 and then his dad buys him one for £ 1,000 1993 : starts competitive go - kart racing			1
1995 : winner of @entity10 cadet @entity53 championship and meetrs @entity4 boss @entity56 and tells him : ' i 'm going to race for you one day ' 1998 : @entity4 sign him up aged 13 - the youngest person ever 2000 : becomes @entity61 karting champion 2001 - 2006 : wins several world series ' in various sized cars 2007 : confirmed as @entity4 's second driver - wins first grand prix in @entity66 - and has most successful rookie season ever 2008 : in dramatic last race in race in @entity70 to take maiden world championship 2009 - present : a series of disappointing seasons means he finishes no higher than fourth in championships september 2012 : leaves @entity4 signs new deal with @entity4 @entity2 had spent weeks denying that he was leaving after news broke last month that he was considering a move away , after rumours of rifts with the team and regular mechanical problems			1
it should earn him £ 45 million until 2016 plus a possible extra £ 15 million in bonuses			0
it will also allow him more freedom to make more money from sponsorship			0
@entity4 , team principal @entity89 paid tribute to the departing @entity2			1
he said : ' it ’s entirely appropriate that i should take this opportunity to pass on our thanks to @entity2			0
he wrote a huge chapter of his life and career with us , and was , and always will be , a fine member of an exclusive club : the @entity4 world champions ’ club			1
' @entity4 have announced that @entity105 driver @entity104 , 22 , will replace @entity2 at the @entity10 outfit next season			1
the @entity108 , a member of the @entity111 driver academy , said : ' i ’m thrilled and delighted to have become a @entity4 driver			0
' the @entity4 name is one of the greatest in the history of @entity116			0
for more than 40 years @entity4 has been a team that every racing driver has aspired to drive for – i was brought up on the great stories of @entity121 ’s many world championship triumphs for @entity4 – and i ’m truly honoured that they ’ve chosen me to partner @entity123 from 2013 onwards , ' he said			0
@entity2 ’s critics will say he is leaving for money but it is understood the offers on the table were similar			0
his basic @entity4 salary of around £ 15m — the same figure he is on at @entity4 — will maintain his status as one of the grid ’s top earners alongside @entity111 ’s @entity135 and possibly @entity137 ’s @entity136			0
that said , @entity4 will offer greater freedom than @entity4 in letting @entity2 ’s management company , @entity141 ’s @entity140 , to strike personal endorsements for their man			1
more important than money — and @entity2 is known to be cautious with his finances — is his desire to improve on a return of one title in five completed seasons , a disappointing statistic for a driver who envisaged himself as a serial champion on his much - heralded arrival in @entity4			1
stars : @entity2 's rise to sporting fame coincided with his on - off relationship with @entity159 singer @entity158 champion : @entity2 embraces his brother @entity162 , centre and @entity158 when he won the @entity166 drivers ' championship in 2008 victory : @entity2 as he wings his way around the @entity171 circuit in @entity172 , where he won the grand prix earlier this month freedom : the move will allow @entity2 and his team more freedom to develop commercial opportunities for the driver - pictured during filming for an advert for bank @entity180 2007 canadian @entity181 rewrote the record books during his rookie season as he finished on the podium in his first nine races			1
the @entity19 led from pole position and kept his cool during four safety car periods to win his first race in @entity116			2
2008 @entity190 was desperate to follow in the steps of his hero @entity121 by standing on the top step of the podium at @entity4 's most glamorous event			2
in wet conditions a sixth - lap brush with the barrier saw @entity2 suffer a puncture , but he recovered masterfully to claim victory			2
2008 @entity10 @entity202 wet - weather masterclass from @entity203			2
having stormed through from fourth on the grid to pass team - mate @entity205 during the early stages			2
the @entity19 simply destroyed the field to win by 68 seconds - the biggest winning margin in a grand prix since 1995			2
2008 @entity210 knew fifth place would guarantee him the title even if rival @entity213 won the race			0
but as the @entity111 driver romped to victory , @entity2 dropped to sixth shortly after pitting during a late - race shower			2
all hope appeared to be lost until the @entity4 passed the @entity219 of @entity220 , struggling on dry - weather tyres , at the very last corner			2
the will - he - wo n’t - he saga has captivated the sport for months but in the end the attraction of a fresh start , away from a team where he has always been treated with parental care , appears to have been too hard for the 27 - year - old to resist			1
the other governing factor was his desire for a championship - winning car			2
@entity89 always claimed that staying put represented the best chance of success , but the evidence for that assertion is patchy : though they are regular race winners , @entity4 have won just a single drivers ’ title since 1999			0
the question is whether @entity4 , who have support at board level in @entity246 but are run from @entity247 , @entity248 , are better equipped to deliver			0
they have only been back in the sport as manufacturers since 2010 , though in their previous guise as @entity251 won the title through @entity253			0
@entity254 , the engineering svengali behind all seven of @entity11 ’s titles , remains team principal and his presence is sure to have been a major lure for @entity2 with significant changes to the engine regulations due for the 2014 season			1
@entity251 exploited a previous revamping of the technical blueprint in 2009 , allowing @entity2 ’s @entity4 team - mate @entity253 to waltz to his championship success			0
with @entity4 as engine makers , @entity251 is well placed to conjure another trick			0
conversely , @entity4 , who get their engines free from @entity4 as part of a long - term association , will have to pay for their supply from next year			1
that will put a strain on their budget			0
old guard : @entity2 will be replacing @entity11 - who is expected to announce his retirement from the sport today disappointing : after his 2008 title win he has failed to secure another - a major reason why he is said to have moved on new guy : @entity2 , left , celebrates on the podium with @entity105 driver @entity104 , of @entity108 , who is set to join @entity4 mercedes have won one race this season to @entity4 ’s five but it is probable that @entity2 would extract more from even this existing car than the 43 - year - old @entity11 and his team - mate @entity290			1
@entity2 is close to @entity291 , @entity4 ’ head of motor sport , who often acted as an avuncular supporter of the young @entity19 back when the @entity246 manufacturers were in full partnership with @entity4			0
as for @entity11 , he has been a shadow of his formerly dominant self since coming out of his first retirement in 2010			1
he has managed just one podium , this year in @entity300 .			0

he will replace retiring legend @entity11 by signing a three - year deal
ends will - he - wo *n't* - he *speculation* about his future after the proposed move was denied for weeks
deal will *cement* his position as one of the sport 's highest - paid drivers
it will also allow him more scope to increase personal endorsements
' it is now time for me to take on a fresh challenge and i am very excited to begin a new chapter , ' he said today
