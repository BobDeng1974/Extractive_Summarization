it has become the @entity2 fixture of the season ... so @entity4 invited @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 to discuss the big incidents from @entity9 v @entity10			1
@entity13 : @entity15 ’s absence is a big loss for @entity9			2
i do n’t fancy @entity18 in midfield at all			2
in fact , it makes me think i might put my boots back on ! there ’s a chance for @entity10 here			1
how bold will they be ? @entity26 : there will be a lot of people tuning in , hoping for @entity30 to fail in this game			1
after his unfair criticism of @entity34 , the rest of football was looking on , saying : ‘ ok , let ’s see what you ’ve got then ... ’ my dad thinks @entity10 win this			1
poll : you can see the tension in the game and what it means to both teams			1
@entity49 just got away with a strong tackle from behind on @entity51 , then screamed at his partner @entity52			1
i do n’t recall you falling out with any of your defensive partners , @entity54			2
this has the feel of a huge game			1
@entity76 looks a threat on the break to me			2
@entity9 will have to deal with that			2
remember that game in @entity82 when he was such a threat going forward ? 15mins : no team have kept a clean sheet at @entity9 ’s stadium since @entity87 in november 2010			1
have @entity10 come to defend ? ‘ are you @entity34 in disguise ? ’ mock the @entity9 fans			1
@entity26 : i ’m loving this start			2
it ’s fast and furious but with quality			2
the passing is so crisp			2
@entity96 just set up a chance for @entity98 , who should have scored			2
@entity99 would have scored that			2
poll : interesting , that			2
players are criticised for going down too easily , but @entity96 stayed on his feet running into the box when there was close attention			0
he might have gone down			0
beaten : @entity107 was powerless to stop the powerful strike mixed emotions : @entity110 and @entity111 watch the action unfold @entity113 : @entity69 sees a brilliant 30 yard shot rattle back off the crossbar @entity26 : city work so hard without the ball			1
they hunt from the front			0
they press high and they have energy without the ball			0
you ’d class @entity98 as a luxury player , but he puts some miles in chasing the ball			2
they have a problem , though , because @entity18 is out of his depth in there			0
he ’s not a midfielder			0
@entity13 : when @entity10 spring forward , @entity9 are missing the wheels of @entity15 to cover and protect			1
@entity110 has set up a team to do a job at both ends of the pitch , but @entity51 does n’t have the power he once had , which is a weakness for @entity10			1
imagine @entity140 in this team			0
@entity110 has been ruthless in his selection , leaving out @entity143 , but @entity144 is making up for it with his energy			1
agonising : @entity98 lays on the floor after narrowly missing a late chance struggles : @entity96 failed to have the same impact without @entity15 next to him @entity26 : we talk about financial fair play , but @entity15 ’s value is going up with every @entity10 attack			1
@entity10 have just had a four - v - two situation and they are beginning to get a grip on the game			1
they have not come to park the bus at all			0
they ’ve come to win			0
it really does look as though @entity110 has got his team selection spot on			1
32mins : @entity63 1 - 0			0
@entity26 : fantastic technique from @entity57 to set up that chance			0
he is becoming as important to this team as @entity140 is to @entity165			0
or @entity99 is to @entity9			0
and he ’s only 22			0
@entity13 : that goal was about intent , @entity167			0
did you see there were five @entity10 players in attacking areas ? the game plan is working perfectly			1
city need to get the ball into their front two more quickly			0
we have n’t seen enough of @entity178 and @entity179 so far			0
poll : we have n’t seen much of any @entity9 players since the early exchanges			0
nothing to do with officiating , but how poor are @entity9 ? if @entity185 was performing this badly , there would be outrage			1
sliding in : @entity52 makes a diving challenge on @entity76 strong challenge : @entity190 attempts to make a tackle on @entity192 shoulder to shoulder : @entity96 ( left ) attempts to wrest the ball from @entity144 @entity26 : @entity179 got a little bang early on from @entity190 and we have n’t seen much of him since			1
i ca n’t believe @entity10 are making @entity190 wait for a new contract , he ’s getting better with age			1
he ’s the best centre back in the country			0
give him a new deal , before someone else does ! the referee has given himself a problem , though			0
four bookings and that @entity69 yellow was so unnecessary			0
i do n’t know why they do it			0
poll : i disagree 100 per cent ! @entity185 has tried to be selective but that has n’t worked			1
now he ’s trying to calm the game down with bookings			2
this is one of those refereeing performances that wo n’t be appreciated by fans — or former players , including you two — but @entity185 has tried to give individuals every chance to play football			1
he could have shown three early yellows but did n’t			0
when the tempo was increased he correctly cautioned four players and if that means a player is sent off for a second caution that is their problem and not his			2
45mins : @entity10 1 - 0 up at the break			1
ineffective : @entity178 ( left ) was surprisingly taken off for @entity229 fish out of water : @entity18 struggled in his holding midfield role @entity26 : @entity18 is like a fish out of water			0
he ’s out of his depth in there and the game is passing him by			2
@entity13 : @entity30 ’s game plan has been executed brilliantly			2
they have so much pace in midfield			0
my only criticism of @entity10 is that they should have scored more			1
with @entity18 in there , it ’s like @entity9 are playing one in midfield			0
@entity96 is brilliant , but he ’s in no hurry to rush back , so the defence is wide open to numbers advancing			0
the team who win the title will be the team with the best balance			0
60mins : @entity10 hit the woodwork for a third time ... dominating : @entity10 hit the woodwork three times on their way to victory like a @entity260 : january signing @entity69 was brilliant in the centre of midfield @entity26 : if this was a boxing match , it would have been stopped			1
poll : @entity266 is lucky to escape a yellow card for that challenge on @entity229			0
you ca n’t say @entity185 has been been card - happy , @entity167 ! he called it right when @entity52 fouled @entity143 , too			1
there is no reference to ‘ last defender ’ in law and it must be a clear and obvious goal - scoring opportunity denied			1
@entity26 : no , @entity69 has been excellent ! when i saw the teams , i was surprised to see him there , but he ’s looked like a @entity260			0
right call : referee @entity185 was correct not to send @entity52 off for his foul on @entity143 as it was n't a clear goalscoring opportunity twinkle toes : @entity9 struggled to handle @entity57 's pace and directness @entity13 : i ca n’t get carried away with @entity69			1
he ’s been very good , but @entity57 is the one for me			0
if you put a pair of skis on @entity57 , he ’d win a gold at the @entity293 with his slalom - like dribbles			0
he ’s my man of the match			2
his balance is beautiful and he ’s cunning too			0
and @entity76 is like a long - distance runner , the @entity298 of the @entity10 team			1
every @entity10 player has been on his ‘ a ’ game			1
that ’s what @entity110 demands , that ’s what he got			1
@entity26 : @entity10 have been magnificent			1
@entity30 has done a number on us all			0
that is what he does — he comes to life in these big games			0
@entity10 have kept clean sheets at @entity313 , @entity314 and @entity9 now , but this was n’t just about defending , though @entity190 and @entity316 were superb			1
let ’s praise @entity110 for that			1
we do n’t always give him credit , but this is a night when he deserves it			0
job well done : @entity190 and @entity316 celebrate at the final whistle dejected : @entity96 and @entity179 leave the pitch off after a tough defeat final word : @entity110 celebrates after a huge result in the title race			1

@entity6 : ' every single @entity10 player has been on his ‘ a ’ game . that is what @entity110 demands , that is what he has got . '
@entity5 : ' if this was a boxing match , they would have stopped the fight . '
@entity7 : ' @entity185 called it right when @entity52 fouled @entity143 too . that was n't a clear goalscoring opportunity . '
