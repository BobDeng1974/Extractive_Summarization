in 1982 , @entity1 - born chanteuse @entity0 had a surprise worldwide hit with i 've never been to me			1
' i 've moved like @entity4 in @entity5 , ' she sang , ' and showed ' em what i got … ' ( actually , when the song became a hit she was in straitened financial circumstances and working in a sweetshop in @entity12 , @entity13 , so instead of moving like @entity4 she could have been singing about moving to @entity4			2
) one of the most irritating lyrics in the song - it has many - is when she sings about the ' @entity17 ' , as if she were discussing the @entity18 or the @entity19			1
do n't take this the wrong way , @entity22 , but is there anybody in your country with a geography o - level to their name ? this may come as a surprise to our transatlantic cousins but @entity36 has rather more islands in its portfolio than one - in fact there are more than 6,000 , most of them uninhabited			1
the number of inhabited islands is counted at anything from 166 to 227 ( depending on the definition of ' inhabited ' i suppose )			0
the view of the blue waters of @entity48 , @entity49 , a stunning @entity36 island untainted by the masses i often wonder why @entity36 does n't sort out its economic problems by selling off some prime @entity53 real estate - how many uninhabited islands does one country really need ? out of the six biggest @entity36 islands , even @entity22 will recognise two : @entity57 - the biggest - and @entity58 ( fourth biggest )			1
i 'm guessing two will be unknown to us all : @entity61 ( second biggest ) and @entity62 ( fifth ) ; and two will sound familiar @entity64 ( third ) and @entity49 ( sixth )			1
you will probably know @entity49 because this was the setting for @entity68 's novel @entity67 and , in direct contravention of usual @entity1 policy , was where the movie was actually filmed			1
@entity49 , it has to be said , has been a little bit reluctant to play the captain @entity76 card too freely in the cause of attracting tourists			1
great book , reasonable film ( despite the fact @entity82 , who played @entity76 , was woefully miscast ) but you can see why the @entity83 were not wholly thrilled to bits by either			0
it took probably the two worst events in the island 's history - the brutal massacre of @entity91 troops in 1943 and the awful earthquake of 1953 - and used them as grist to the story 's romantic mill. @entity49 is perhaps best known as the setting for @entity68 's novel @entity67 the 2001 film adaptation starred @entity82 and @entity96 but focussed on negative events @entity49 , however , is simply stunning - an absolute gem			1
i had visited @entity100 , the neighbouring island , and was n't impressed			1
it has some nice beaches but it has been tarnished by tourism of the cheap and nasty sort - lots of scuzzy booze clubs where young brits go to behave badly			1
@entity49 , on the other hand , has remained relatively pristine			1
this has probably much to do with the fact that its airport is of a size that would find it difficult to cope with the modest level of air traffic arriving on the @entity115			1
it 's a large island , about a quarter of the size of @entity118 , but with just a 20th of the number of tourists of the @entity122 hotspot			1
on arrival , i found myself gaping at the sublime beauty of the place			0
in parts it reminded me of @entity128 with its gently wooded rolling slopes dotted with trees			0
@entity49 is by no means perfect : the roads are sub b - road standard and signposting is practically nonexistent or , for obvious but unhelpful reasons , in @entity36 letters ( a big problem when your satnav starts shrugging its digital shoulders and goes into sulk mode )			1
in a rare case for @entity1 the film was actually shot in @entity49 where the book 's events took place the sheer sublime beauty of @entity49 recalls elements of @entity128 but it 's by no means perfect the instructions that told us how to get from the airport to our villa had lots of details like : ' turn right after the yellow sign near the olive oil shop halfway up the hill from the bakers			1
' the drive south should have taken 30 minutes but proved much longer with the complicated route			0
it was a relief , however , to find that tourism had made only limited progress , with just one or two modest - sized hotels in evidence			1
eventually we discovered our glorious property - the @entity167 - with an ' oh my @entity169 ' view over @entity48 beach			2
while unpacking , i decided to take my ease on the hammock			0
and so it was i had my you 've been framed moment , toppling straight off and landing on my head			0
i rose groggily from the dust to find myself being stared at by part - time resident cat @entity179			2
@entity179 the cat was reliable company when food was on offer ... or when he thought it should be i 'm pretty sure ' @entity186 ' is a name near the top of every stray cat ' watch list ' around the world			0
wherever we travel , we barely have time to unpack before some flea - ridden derelict is attempting to wrest food from our table			2
@entity179 joined us at the table whenever he was aware that food was on the go			0
he also made his presence felt when he considered that food ought to be on the go			0
he was around , therefore , most of the daylight hours - and as he was getting so well fed ( we ended up getting him proper cat food from the supermarket ) he often stuck around all night			2
i often found myself giving him bits of cheese at 3am ( in fairness , he would eat almost anything )			0
the one moment that @entity179 noticeably made himself scarce was the night of the fire			0
at 2am one night towards the end of our stay , we became aware that a huge wild fire had broken out about a mile away			0
in these situations it 's hard to know at what point you need to get out ; too soon you look foolish , too late you look dead			2
the fire grew in sudden bursts , the flames fanned by strong winds ; but it was not obviously coming in our direction … yet			0
we sat watchful on our balcony with our bags packed ready to escape			0
we eventually went back to bed			0
at 6am , i was awoken by a helicopter and a plane which began scooping up water from the sea and then headed over the fire zone to dump it - a laborious process that went on for hours			2
later in the day we walked down to examine the site , expecting to see acres consumed by the conflagration			0
in fact the fire - damaged area was surprisingly small			2
the one must - do outing in @entity49 is to @entity241 , a lovely harbour , and @entity243 , an excellent waterfront restaurant that seems to attract an a-list crowd			1
booked for that evening , we heard , were @entity248 and mrs @entity249 whose annual yacht trip normally brings them here			0
the lovely harbour of @entity241 is a must - visit place for anyone staying on @entity49 @entity254 offers villas from € 699 ( £ 520 ) per week			1
seven nights at @entity167 costs from € 2,159 ( £ 1,600 )			0
@entity257 flies from @entity258 to @entity49 from £ 36.99pp one way			1
@entity260 launched a new route from @entity258 to @entity49 in april			1
for further information on @entity36 go to visitgreece.gr			1
on our way back we passed by the monastery where the body of @entity49 's patron @entity267 is kept in a glass case			1
on his holy day the body is passed over the ill and the sick in the hope of curing them			0
also worth a visit is the harbour of @entity277 , where big turtles cruise up and down the waterfront looking for food			2
like @entity179 , i imagine , they 'll eat anything			0
back at the @entity167 , even though it was still just 3pm , @entity179 had convinced himself it was teatime			0
we did n't disappoint him			2
we had a glass of the lovely local @entity289 wine as we soaked up the glorious afternoon sun. @entity179 had a tin of @entity292 .			2

@entity49 is stunning and does n't play the @entity67 card
island has n't been tainted by the crowds its @entity36 *counterparts* get
it 's a quarter of the size of @entity122 's @entity118 but with a 20th of the tourists
the one must - do outing in @entity49 is to @entity241 , a lovely harbour
