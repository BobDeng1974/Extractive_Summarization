there was a moment here on thursday when @entity3 tossed a ball towards a young fan in the crowd , only to see the hairy hand of a bearded man intercept it			1
‘ that was for the kid , ’ said @entity3 , fixing the guy with his gaze until the ball had been surrendered to the intended recipient			1
@entity3 was that relaxed during what amounted to a near flawless 66 ; so in control , he was able to engage with spectators while shooting six birdies and 12 pars with a marvellous demonstration of power and precision to lead the 143rd @entity23			1
‘ @entity42 ’ was the term being used in @entity3 ’s presence at the press conference he gave after storming to the summit of the leaderboard and he was happy to accept that the statistics do n’t lie			1
in this year alone he is 57 under par for first rounds but nine over for second rounds			0
he even admitted @entity46 had raised the issue when the two met for lunch near their respective homes in @entity51 shortly after his second round collapse at @entity53 in may			2
‘ he said : “ how the hell can you shoot 63 and then 78 ? ” and then we talked about holding a round together , although not specifically about my previous struggles on fridays			1
’ the fact that he was able to smile about such torturous moments — among them the 80 that followed his tournament - leading 63 at @entity65 four years ago — would suggest he is not overly concerned about his ability to remain in contention			2
at one point he actually listed his previous friday travails			2
‘ i had a bad friday afternoon at @entity72 and then just made the cut , ’ he said without the slightest hint of paranoia			2
top man : @entity3 topped the leaderboard after the first day at sun - drenched royal @entity76 centre of attention : a camera follows @entity3 along the 14th fairway in control : @entity3 will hope to continue his form into friday where conditions are expected to worsen video @entity23 : first @entity25 highlights ‘ and then i started off horrifically at @entity88 on friday afternoon			1
and then did the same thing at @entity90			0
that ’s like three tournaments in a row			0
that ’s when i was conscious of it			0
i was three - over through nine on friday at @entity96 and then i was able to get it back in form			1
and then @entity53 obviously was the biggest one			0
’ he laughed when a reporter suggested he could simply ‘ pretend it ’s still thursday ’			0
he also admitted he had been advised to resort to rather more radical tactics			0
‘ someone has made a suggestion , but i should n’t mention what it is or who it was , ’ he said			0
sensibly , @entity3 said it was more a case of managing expectations			1
‘ whenever i go out and play on thursdays there ’s not really many expectations , ’ he said			0
‘ but when you go back out on friday after a good score , you know what you can do on the golf course			2
i need to approach the round the same way i did here			2
’ @entity3 was magnificent on thursday , even if he probably should have taken birdie at the first before hitting a sublime approach shot at the second to go one under there instead			1
that second shot , hit to within a foot of the hole from 191 yards out with a six iron , was , he agreed , among his finest			2
following behind : @entity127 finished the day one shot behind @entity3 at a glance : spectators flocked to watch the action at @entity30 not until the fifth hole did the driver appear , but it was worth the wait ; a monstrous 353 yards and almost 20 yards further than anyone had so far managed on that particular fairway			1
it made getting a birdie on the par five a relatively straightforward exercise for the two - time major winner and was quickly followed by a 12 - foot putt on the par three sixth to take him to three under			1
the fourth birdie would come at the 10th and not until the 11th would he even find the deep rough that is proving so problematic for some here			0
a poor second shot left @entity3 chipping from the long stuff but the response was majestic , his ball rolling to within two feet of the pin			1
a hole later , completed with a 10 - foot putt for birdie number five , and he was in the outright lead			1
by getting down in two from sand on the 16th he secured his sixth birdie			0
at times he was as daring as his royal blue trousers ; at others mature beyond his 25 years			0
in the end it was probably the positioning of his tee - shots that separated him from his even younger playing partners , @entity165 and @entity166			1
‘ today was just a real solid round of golf , ’ he said			0
‘ my 63 at @entity65 was a better round of golf , but there were similarities in there			0
’ now he just needs to make sure comparisons are not being made with that second round at the home of golf			0

@entity3 leads @entity23 after first round 66
@entity183 has one shot lead over @entity127
conditions set to *deteriorate* at @entity30 on friday
@entity3 *infamously* threw away first - day open lead in 2010 as conditions worsened on second day
two - time @entity192 winner has a habit of playing badly on fridays
