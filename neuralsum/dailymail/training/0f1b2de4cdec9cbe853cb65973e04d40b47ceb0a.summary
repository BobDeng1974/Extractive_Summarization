glad to be alive : performance poet @entity0 was just 45 minutes from death after suffering acute appendicitis lying on a hospital trolley , his stomach gripped by spasmodic episodes of searing pain , @entity0 expected the journey to the operating theatre to be his last			1
diagnosed with appendicitis and warned of the possibility that he could be suffering from septicaemia ( blood poisoning ) , the poet and writer knew the outcome looked bleak			1
‘ i just remember lying there thinking i could die here			1
but strangely , i did n’t mind for myself , ’ he says			1
‘ i told myself i ’d had a good life			1
‘ but then i kept thinking of my poor mum , who used to be a nurse and still volunteers as a hospital visitor in @entity21			1
' i ’m one of eight brothers and sisters and we ’re so close			1
what would she do ? this would break her heart			1
’ fortunately , no one had to break such calamitous news to mrs @entity32 – even though doctors later told her 53 - year - old son that he had been 45 minutes from death because of the advanced stage of his condition			1
but speaking for the first time about nearly losing his life , @entity40 – known to a new generation through his role in @entity45 series @entity43 – does dwell on the irony that his non-drinking , non-smoking , exercise - loving vegan lifestyle gave him no protection from appendicitis , which randomly affects six in every 100 people in the @entity53			1
what ’s more , unlike sir @entity54 , who last year had his appendix out after two weeks of serious pain , he was given no advance warning			1
the day of the trauma – march 22 , 2012 – started like any other			1
@entity40 , professor of poetry at @entity60 in @entity61 , had been lecturing students on novel writing when he felt a ‘ little pop ’ in his stomach			1
‘ i did n’t think anything of it , ’ says @entity40 , who broke into the literary world while performing dub poetry alongside stand - up comedians and punk bands in 1980s @entity61			1
‘ however , over the next few hours i started to feel slightly nauseous and i had a vague stitch in my right - hand side			1
i thought maybe it had just been a long day			1
' then as the pains started to get a little worse , i thought i had some kind of food poisoning since it reminded me of how i felt when i once ate an out - of - date can of pineapples			1
’ back in his hotel room – his home is in @entity83 – he tried to sleep off the now escalating pain and sickness			1
get it out : how an appendix is removed during an operation ‘ by about 6.30am , the pain was so bad that i was almost hallucinating			1
somehow , i reached for the phone to call reception for help , but as i picked up the receiver i could n’t speak			1
the receptionist must have heard me panting down the phone and raced upstairs			1
when i did n’t answer the door , he got someone to kick it down			1
’ he was rushed to @entity100 and recalls a young doctor smiling over him			2
‘ she looked about 17 , and the first thing she said was , “ i ’ve just read one of your novels			2
” i think she was trying to calm me down as she then told me i had suspected appendicitis and they needed to get me on the operating table – fast			1
’ the appendix is a finger - shaped pouch connected to the large intestine which sits in the lower right side of the stomach			2
an evolutionary throwback , it is ‘ absolutely useless ’ , says surgeon @entity119 of @entity120 in @entity61 and @entity121			2
however , if it becomes inflamed it must be removed urgently			2
left untreated , the appendix can become abscessed , then gangrenous and burst , releasing poison into the abdomen , causing peritonitis – inflammation of the lining of the abdomen – which can spread rapidly to the rest of the body			2
appendicitis is most common in people aged ten to 19 but can happen at any age , and it remains the most common reason for emergency surgery			1
appendicitis : if the appendix becomes inflamed it needs to be removed immediately @entity119 says : ‘ appendicitis is usually triggered by a blockage at the entrance of the appendix which can then become inflamed			1
' it can happen to anyone – there is n’t anything that makes one person more or less vulnerable			2
’ sometimes , he says , the condition can be overlooked in its early stages , possibly confused with gastroenteritis , gallstones , or a urinary tract infection			2
' there is only one treatment – removing the appendix , either through keyhole or open surgery			2
‘ it can take from 20 minutes to three hours depending on what the surgeon finds – such as a lot of infection , ’ says @entity119			2
‘ i have done one through open surgery in 12 minutes			2
’ @entity40 was told his operation would begin with keyhole surgery but if the appendix burst they would need to open him up to reach infected areas			2
with keyhole surgery , three small incisions are made – one near the belly button , one about 1in long in the lower right of the stomach , and then a tiny incision in the middle of the bikini line			2
a camera is placed through one incision to assess the state of the appendix			0
then it is carefully removed through the port on the right side of the stomach			0
@entity40 recalls : ‘ i did n’t care how they did it			0
i was n’t in a place to make decisions			0
anyway , they gave me morphine and it all started to get a bit surreal			0
i remember the anaesthetist being this rather prim but kindly @entity194 character while the theatre nurse was a guy from @entity196 who kept up an optimistic patois , saying things like , “ tell me a poem , man			0
” ’ although the appendix had ruptured , it had not burst			0
however , @entity40 was told it had been a close call			0
‘ it was almost ready to burst			0
my surgeon told me that had i waited another 45 minutes for help , i ’d have been a dead man			0
those words still play round and round my head – how close i was to not making it			0
‘ when i came round , i just thought , wow , i ’m still here			0
what was incredible was that there were three of my students by my bed			0
they ’d bought me fruit and @entity219 patties			0
the head of my department phoned and i burst into tears			0
i was glad to be alive			0
’ @entity40 spent two days in hospital , and then two weeks in @entity224 recuperating before returning home			0
‘ putting my key in the door was an emotional moment , ’ he says			0
‘ at one point there was a chance i ’d never come back			0
i also could n’t help thinking how great the @entity232 had been			0
they cured me , and not one person asked me to write a cheque			0
’ now fully recovered , the only manifestation of his ordeal are three small but fading scars			0
he continues to practise tai chi and yoga and always starts the day with an hour of aerobic exercise , such as cycling			0
he breakfasts on muesli and fruit and then eats nothing until about 6pm , when he enjoys a tasty vegan dish such as butter bean stew			1
@entity40 says : ‘ i never took life for granted , but what this has taught me is that if i have the slightest twinge of inspiration , then i go for it			0
everyone should feel this way			0
‘ do n’t wait until you ’re challenged to do the same			0

@entity0 is a *teetotal* , *super-fit* , non-smoking vegan
but that did not stop him from suffering from acute appendicitis
