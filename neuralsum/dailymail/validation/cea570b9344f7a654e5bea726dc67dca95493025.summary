the weekly shop has become something of a modern day nightmare with stores asking us to either scan as we shop or use self - service tills			1
but now one of @entity8 's biggest supermarkets has turned its back on technology in favour of human staff manning stores			2
@entity14 's new ceo , @entity13 , who took over last week has scrapped the @entity16 ( @entity17 ) system used in shops after receiving feedback from customers and staff			1
@entity14 has ditched its @entity22 in favour of returning to using humans to decide how many checkouts to open in stores the technology , which was introduced in 2008 , used infrared sensors to determine how many checkouts to open by monitoring the number of customer flowing through the store			1
it meant that during quieter periods staff could be taken off the tills and placed in other parts of the store			0
the company 's retail team , along with the new boss , concluded that checkout teams would make better and more balanced decisions compared to the @entity17 computer system			1
but while they have brought humans back to monitor queues , the controversial self - scan tills will be here to stay			1
@entity47 executive mr @entity13 , who took over as @entity14 ’ chief executive on march 16 , spoke with customers and staff and after feedback decided to scrap some of the modern day technologies @entity14 was the only @entity8 retailer to use @entity17 , which used infrared sensors both at the entrance to the store and over each checkout lanes			1
it was supposed to enable checkout managers to predict exactly when shoppers would arrive at the checkouts so the tills were open for them when they got there			2
when the @entity17 system was first rolled out as part of a trial with the promise of cutting customer waiting times it had a five per cent success rate , however , staff claimed the system was pointless			1
some took to online job review website @entity72 to complain , with a department manager in @entity74 , @entity75 , describing it as ' a waste of time and money '			0
the unnamed manager had added : ' it [ the @entity17 ] messes up all the departments in the store and it has a major knock on effect to all other departments with the waste and markdown and rotation			2
' a checkout operator from @entity91 , writing in october last year , said : ' @entity14 needs to go back to basics			0
we are a superior supermarket and that 's what we need to install in customers old and new			0
' customers want to be treated			0
show them we care more than the other leading stores			0
' after listening to colleagues executives have also decided to scrap another computerised system which measures the amount of products scanned every minute by checkout staff			0
the ' scan rate ' was introduced in 2012 after imposing new time targets of one item every three seconds , which prompted an outcry from members of the public , who branded the supermarket as turning into a ' battery hen farm '			1
mr @entity13 , a former executive at @entity113 , said : ' we intend to be an organisation that listens very hard to its customers and staff and , wherever possible , responds quickly			2
' our colleagues in our stores are best placed to use their experience and personal judgement in deciding how best to serve their customers , keeping queues low at the checkouts and improving the customer ’s shopping trip			0

the @entity16 ( @entity17 ) system has now been scrapped
@entity14 's ceo @entity13 took over last week and ditched technology
it used *special* sensors to determine how many checkouts should be open
but feedback from staff and customers determined it was ' waste of time '
supermarket has also got *rid* of ' scan rate ' which counts items scanned
the controversial self - service tills are expected to stay despite changes
