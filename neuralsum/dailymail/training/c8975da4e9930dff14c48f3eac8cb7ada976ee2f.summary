by @entity0 published : 21:09 est , 1 november 2012 updated : 21:10 est , 1 november 2012 @entity2 traders toyed with electricity prices at several major power trading hubs in the western @entity5 to boost their own profits			1
the men were caught , and @entity2 slapped with a $ 470million fine , after they bragged about the price rigging in a series of damning , foul - mouthed e-mails			1
four traders are accused of conspiring to sell electricity at a loss to drive prices down between november 2006 and 2008			0
this enabled simultaneous bets on falling energy prices to reap huge profits , leading to losses of $ 140million for other investors and pensions funds			2
emails and phone messages between foul - mouthed @entity2 traders in @entity25 reveal how they bragged about rigging energy prices in @entity27 to make huge profits however , the actions are not believed to have raised energy prices for consumers			2
critics yesterday said the expletive - ridden correspondence provides further evidence of the ‘ rotten culture of casino banking ’ that built up under @entity36 , the disgraced former ceo of the @entity38 bank			1
the price manipulation took place at four electricity - trading hubs across the western @entity5 , according to the @entity42			1
the hubs are : @entity44 in @entity45 , @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 and @entity50 15 in @entity51			0
these hubs are where electricity is channelled , stored and then distributed around the region			0
@entity2 and other banks trade in complicated financial instruments which bet on electricity price movements at these hubs			0
the bank faces a £ 270million fine by the @entity5 @entity42 for allegedly manipulating the energy market across @entity27 between november 2006 and 2008 the accused @entity2 traders – @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 – face penalties totalling $ 18million			1
@entity64 was described as ‘ the leader of the manipulative scheme ’ and the highest paid			0
he faces a $ 15million fine			1
the bank was also ordered to pay back $ 35million in profits made from the alleged energy manipulation scam			1
but , in arguably a more devastating blow to @entity2 , the @entity5 regulator published a series of emails and phone messages sent by the bank ’s traders			1
in a series of messages dated november 3 , 2006 , @entity66 bragged to a colleague that he had managed to manipulate the energy markets			0
he said : ‘ i totally f * * * * * * with the @entity46 market today , ’ adding : ‘ i just started lifting the p * * * out of the palo			0
’ @entity66 continued : ‘ was fun			0
need to do that more often			0
’ in a separate exchange on december 7 , 2006 , he said : ‘ i ’m going to c * * * on the @entity50 light and it should drive the @entity93 light lower			0
’ critics said the crude messages reinforced the immoral , profit - crazed image that @entity2 has desperately tried to shed since new chief executive @entity97 took over in august			2
critics say the expletive - ridden correspondence provides further evidence of the ' rotten culture of casino banking ' that built up under disgraced former boss of @entity2 , @entity36 , left @entity104 , who sits on the treasury select committee of mps , said : ‘ this just shows how the rotten culture of casino banking that was built up under @entity36 went all the way through @entity2			1
traders were clearly programmed to do anything to make a profit			0
’ the emails sent by @entity2 ’ @entity5 traders have echoes of the brash messages sent by their counterparts in @entity118 who boasted about rigging key interest rates			2
these were published in june when @entity2 was fined $ 470million by @entity38 and @entity5 regulators over the scandal			1
this led to the departure of @entity36 and several other top executives			2
@entity128 peer @entity126 said : ‘ the @entity5 authorities ’ allegations of @entity134 - style rigging of electricity prices shows what a toxic trail @entity36 left behind him			1
’ all four traders accused of rigging the energy markets are thought to have left the bank , although none are understood to have been fired			2
@entity2 has been given 30 days to appeal and said it intends to do so			0
it said it ‘ strongly disagrees with the allegations ’ , adding : ‘ we believe that our trading was legitimate and above board and intend to vigorously defend this matter			0
’ @entity2 is likely to argue that it did not have big enough positions in the energy market to be able to manipulate prices .			1
