@entity15 officials had ordered the man ’s deportation three years ago - about 18 months after he married and 11 months after he was convicted of handling stolen goods and given an 18 - month jail term			1
but the @entity22 today ruled that the man should stay			2
three appeal judges refused to overturn a decision by an immigration tribunal , which had concluded that deportation would not be in the best interests of his teenage step - daughter			1
the tribunal had been told the girl did not have any involvement with her birth father and regarded the man as her ' de facto father '			2
it concluded that having a ' de facto father ' was in the youngster ’s best interests and said deporting the man would be a breach of a right to family life enshrined in @entity43			2
appeal judges - who included @entity45 , the @entity46 , and the second most senior judge in @entity48 and @entity49 - said they could find ' no basis ' for interfering with the tribunal ’s decision			1

he said the @entity15 officials had conceded that it would not be reasonable to expect the man ’s wife and step - daughter - who met the man when she was about 13 - to live in @entity8			1
and the upper tribunal had felt that it was in the child ’s ' best interests ' to have a ' de facto father as she grows up ' - and after weighing evidence had been satisfied that deportation would not be proportionate			1
' they conducted a meticulous assessment of the factors weighing in favour of deportation and those weighing against , ' said @entity45			0
' as they said , the factors in favour of deportation were substantial			0
they properly gave significant weight to the serious view taken by the secretary of state of ( his ) criminality and his poor immigration history			0
' on the other hand , they attached considerable importance to the interests of ( the girl )			0
the decision was finely balanced			0
' he added : ' but they did not take into account any irrelevant factors and they did not fail to take into account any relevant factors			0
