by @entity0 - jones published : 09:11 est , 16 january 2014 updated : 11:32 est , 16 january 2014 a @entity3 castle once said to be haunted by a man hanged for stealing sheep , was placed on the market today for £ 2.25m			1
standing augustly in the centre of @entity9 , the grand building is a stone 's throw away from the @entity14 town 's prestigious golf course and opposite the 12th - century cathedral where @entity16 christened her son @entity17			1
the castle , which dates back to the 15th century , commands extensive views along the coast towards the beach in nearby @entity22 and across the @entity23 to the purple hills of @entity25 and @entity26			1
haunted castle for sale : potential buyers who are n't scared by the price might be more worried by stories that the ghost of a sheep thief was seen after being hung			1
however , a previous owner has had the building exorcised but despite its great vantage point it was never intended for military purposes and was converted into a hotel in 1947			1
@entity40 played its part as a school , a jail and a courthouse , but it is perhaps best known for being haunted by a thief called @entity47 who was imprisoned in its dungeons and then killed for snatching ewes and rams			2
@entity52 , the daughter of the sheriff substitute of @entity22 , was the first person to claim to see @entity47 's ghost at the end of the 19th century			2
she said she saw a grey - haired man with a ' weird face ' , thick grey stockings and knee breeches sitting in her father 's study when she came in from the garden to get some honeycomb for tea one day			0
when she returned to the room with her family the apparition had gone			0
converted castle : the b - grade building in @entity9 , near @entity22 , was given permission to become a hotel in 1947			1
it boasts a bar with an open fire ( pictured ) and some of the original brickwork but the legend says that @entity47 's ghost reappeared later that night next to the bed of @entity52 's uncle , the minister of avoch , while he was sleeping			0
ms @entity81 's uncle is reported to have woken up and told the ghost he would call his brother , who was the sheriff , if he did not go away			0
the ghost has never been seen since			0
after listening to his brother and daughter 's description of the ghost , sheriff @entity52 recognised it as @entity47			0
despite @entity47 's disappearance , the castle 's new owner in 1922 took no chances and had the building exorcised before moving in			1
rising above the town : @entity9 cathedral is at the heart of the @entity14 town and @entity16 had her son @entity17 christened here in 2003 the property was renamed @entity40 in 1947 and was featured in a programme about haunted hotels on the @entity105 in 2003			1
it was originally built as the home for the @entity108 of @entity109 and then subsequently gifted to 11th @entity110 in 1557			1
although it was set on fire during a dispute between the @entity116 and @entity117 in 1570 and then rebuilt , some of the original building does remain			2
despite being a category b - listed castle , which means it is of regional importance , permission was granted to turn it into a 25 - room hotel			2
boasting a restaurant for 90 people and a bar with an open fire , it still features some of the 15th century brickwork and is a popular wedding venue			1
just a five - minute walk away lies the @entity23 , which is a @entity133 , making it a prime spot for twitchers , walkers and cyclists to visit			0
taking a swing : golfers tee off at the prestigious @entity9 club which is only a short hit away from the castle visitors with small planes and helicopters can also make use of the nearby @entity148			2
@entity149 of @entity150 who are selling the property said : ' @entity40 is a quite stunning building , full of atmosphere and history , yet it also has all the luxuries one could expect from modern life			0
' from general tourism to sports specific visitors and also weddings , this is a great opportunity for someone who wants to enter the hospitality industry or expand their portfolio			0
' prices for castles vary sharply from £ 375,000 which was asked for @entity169 in @entity14 to the medieval @entity170 in @entity171 , @entity172 which was put up for sale for £ 5.5 million .			0

built around end of 15th century , castle given to @entity110 in 1557
it is said to have been haunted by a sheep thief kept in its dungeons
