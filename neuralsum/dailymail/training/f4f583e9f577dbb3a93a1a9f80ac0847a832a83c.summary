by @entity0 a waiter who claims he is the illegitimate son of @entity3 's former king has lodged his claim in the country 's highest court in a bid to finally prove he is of royal blood			1
@entity9 , 58 , whose adoptive parents are peasants from @entity11 , says his dna matches that of @entity13 , 76 , the monarch who abdicated the throne last month and allegedly bedded more than 1,500 women			1
his mother is said to have met the former king when she was 18 in the 1950s , six years before he married @entity18 of @entity19 and @entity20 and 20 years before he took the throne			1
now the suit has been passed on to the @entity23 by a lower court where it had been under review in light of controversial new legal protections for ex-king @entity13 , 76 , who lost his total immunity when he quit the throne last month			1
royal blood ? @entity9 , 58 , ( left ) says his @entity12 matches that of @entity13 , the monarch who abdicated the throne in june @entity13 automatically lost the total immunity which he enjoyed during his 39 - year reign when he abdicated on june 18 , leading lawmakers to rush in controversial new legal protections for the ageing former monarch			1
unlike his previous immunity , the new measures do not completely shield @entity13			2
he now must answer to @entity3 's highest court , the @entity23 , which has a high threshold for evidence , giving him similar protection enjoyed by many high - ranking civil servants and politicians			1
the court will now have to decide whether it accepts the suit or shelves it			2
affair ? @entity9 claims that his birth mother , the daughter of a well - known @entity53 banker , may have had an affair with the king before he married @entity18 ( pictured with @entity13 in june ) , which resulted in his birth mr @entity9 was born under the rule of dictator @entity59 ruled @entity3 , at a time when the country was extremely conservative and stringently @entity62			1
it meant babies that were born out of wedlock were frowned upon			2
therefore he was taken to @entity67 as an infant before he moved in with his adoptive family in @entity53			2
despite claims to royal heritage , @entity9 now works in the humble environment of a restaurant in the town of @entity75 near @entity76			1
' @entity77 ' : @entity13 is said to have bedded more than 1,500 women in a ' @entity77 - style ' romantic career , that allegedly included @entity80 ( pictured together in 1987 ) according to @entity81 , he believed he had powerful links when a private helicopter arrived to pick him up during military service so he could visit his adoptive father			0
as a result , he began to send letters to the palace , demanding a meeting with his ' father ' , but he never received a reply			0
he told the paper : ' i 've no choice now but to put pressure on him			0
' @entity96 has the right to know where he is from			0
i do n't want to hurt the king or country			0
i wish @entity100 all the best			0
' he got inspiration from @entity103 , who also claims the former @entity3 king is her father			1
@entity103 says her mother @entity105 first met @entity13 in 1956 in @entity106 and again in 1966 in @entity107 where she was conceived			2
in 2012 , she said : ' my mum told me who my father was while we were watching the tv together			0
' her case is partly to blame for @entity3 mps signing legislation that would reinstate his immunity from prosecution , a right he lost when he gave up the throne to his son mr @entity9 believes the @entity3 king , said to have bedded more than 1,500 women in a ‘ @entity77 - style ’ romantic career , met his birth mother during a trip to the @entity128 capital in the fifties from a military academy in @entity131 where he was studying			1
@entity53 - based author @entity132 , made the explosive claim @entity13 , 71 , had an affair with princess @entity80 in a book she published earlier this year			0
