by @entity0 published : 08:47 est , 4 may 2013 updated : 03:41 est , 6 may 2013 hundreds of women are being recalled for breast cancer checks amid fears that a bungling junior hospital doctor mistakenly gave them the all - clear			1
letters were last week sent to 272 patients who underwent routine breast screening over 18 months from january 2011			1
the women , who were originally told follow - ups were not required , have been asked to return to the @entity11 in @entity12 for further checks after a male junior doctor there failed to carry out correct procedures at their screening sessions			1
@entity11 , where around 250 women attended breast screenings that may not have been carried out properly			1
consultants at the @entity12 hospital raised concerns over a junior doctor the unnamed medic is now under investigation over his alleged lapse following complaints about his performance at the clinic up to july 2012			1
consultants who run the breast clinic raised the alarm as they were unhappy with the way the doctor conducted his initial assessment of some of the patients			1
hospital bosses said his work ‘ potentially did not meet our usual high standards ’ and stressed that the recall was ‘ precautionary ’			1
a spokeswoman for the royal @entity45 declined to name the junior doctor , but said he was no longer working at the hospital			1
‘ we have no evidence of any harm to the patients seen by this junior doctor , ’ she said			1
‘ however , as a precaution , we are bringing some patients back for an assessment by a consultant			1
at this stage , we have invited those patients who were only seen by this junior doctor			1
’ around 250 patients were screened for breast cancer have been recalled for another assessment the doctor is being investigated by the @entity63 over the incident , the spokeswoman added			1
the hospital has also asked the @entity66 to assist in a review			2
@entity68 , consultant breast surgeon at the @entity45 , said : ‘ although we have found no evidence of any harm , the safety of our patients is our number one priority			2
‘ we do , however , realise that for those patients who we do recall , this may lead to additional anxiety and we apologise for the distress that this may cause			2
‘ @entity81 is being proactive with this recall , which is about clinical standards			2
there are no other concerns			0
i want to assure all the patients we contact that they will be offered a prompt appointment , with access to a support telephone line in the interim should they need it			0
’ @entity92 , clinical director of support charity @entity93 , said : ‘ while there is currently no evidence of any misdiagnosis in this instance , a recall to a breast clinic can inevitably cause a great deal of anxiety for both patients and their families			0
we would hope that in such a rare instance , the hospital will see these patients as quickly as possible			1
’ @entity106 , the @entity11 ’s director of nursing , said extra clinics were being arranged so that women affected could be seen as soon as possible			2
a telephone hotline is also available for anxious patients seeking support			0
‘ we ’re inviting them back to reassure them and so that they can see one of our consultants , ’ she said			0
‘ we have been reviewing the records carefully and have sent the patients a letter			0
‘ we ’ve also put on additional clinics so that patients can come back in			2
’ the @entity123 is estimated to save 1,400 lives a year in @entity125 alone			0
one in eight women will develop breast cancer at some stage in their life			0
eighty per cent of breast cancers occur in women over 50			0
women aged between 50 and 70 are invited for checks every three years			0
in some areas , this is being extended to include those between 47 and 73			0
those over 70 can ask to be screened			0
@entity139 of the charity @entity140 said : ‘ any variation from the usual high standards of breast screening is extremely worrying			2
we are pleased to see that the hospital is acting with urgency in reassuring those affected and ensuring that this does not happen again			0
‘ we hope it does n’t put women off attending their screening appointment , as early detection offers the best chance of a successful outcome			0
