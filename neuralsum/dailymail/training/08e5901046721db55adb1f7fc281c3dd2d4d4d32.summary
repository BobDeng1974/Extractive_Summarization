by @entity0 @entity1 is @entity3 ’s latest defensive concern ahead of the @entity5 qualifying opener against @entity6 on sunday night			2
the @entity8 centre - half was forced to watch saturday evening ’s training at the @entity10 from the sidelines as he nursed a groin problem			1
and he will need to prove his fitness on the morning of the game to take his place at the heart of @entity18 ’s defence to face the @entity20 winners			0
sidelined : @entity1 was forced to sit out training on saturday as @entity3 prepared for the @entity22 down to the wire : the @entity8 defender will have a late test to prove his fitness in @entity26 @entity18 , whose squad travelled to @entity26 on saturday without injured defenders @entity29 and @entity30 , expressed confidence in @entity32 and @entity33 teaming up if that is his chosen pairing			1
‘ @entity1 felt it on friday , so we took him out of training as a precaution , ’ said @entity18			0
‘ he will train in the morning and we ’ll find out then because we normally name the team right before training			0
‘ we have been doing alright at centre - half , though			0
if you look at @entity32 since he came in , the results with @entity18 and @entity33 together have been ok			1
replacement : @entity33 ( left ) and @entity32 will start together if @entity1 is unable to play ‘ but we know how we ’re going to play , we know the formation			2
we ’ve been doing it for a year and we have tidied up this week so that everyone , no matter what position they play in , knows exactly what ’s needed			0
’ @entity3 have kept a clean sheet the last three times @entity1 has played — against @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55			0
@entity32 and @entity33 were in partnership to keep out the @entity57 at @entity58 last november , part of a six - match unbeaten streak			1
faith : @entity18 believes in his back - up defenders who kept a clean sheet together last year against the @entity57			1

@entity8 defender *missed* out with groin problem in saturday training
@entity70 and @entity30 already definitely out
@entity3 short of *options* at the back
@entity32 and @entity33 could start against @entity22
@entity18 happy with back - up partnership who have played well together
