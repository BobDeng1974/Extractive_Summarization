by @entity0 toddler : @entity2 died in @entity3 after becoming entangled in a window blind cord a toddler tragically died after becoming entangled in a window blind cord , an inquest heard today			1
@entity2 's mother had only left her in the lounge watching her favourite tv show for a few minutes when she popped upstairs			1
in those few moments the 17 - month - old - described as a ‘ happy , typically inquisitive toddler ’ - had climbed onto a chair to either look out of the window or to try to reach a photograph hidden behind the curtain when she became caught in the nylon blind cord on the morning of june 27 this year			1
her mother , @entity21 , came back downstairs and discovered @entity2 behind the curtain hanging from the cord in the lounge of their home in @entity27 , near @entity28 , @entity3			1
miss @entity21 called 999 and desperately tried to revive her daughter using the first aid training she had learned a few weeks earlier			0
@entity2 was taken to @entity31 where doctors spent more than an hour attempting to revive the toddler but they were unable to save her			1
miss @entity21 , 22 , and her partner @entity34 were too upset to attend today 's hearing at @entity36			2
in a statement read to the hearing , miss @entity21 said she had left @entity2 watching @entity39 while she went upstairs to get some of her daughter 's clothing because mr @entity34 's mother @entity42 was arriving to collect her granddaughter for the day			1
‘ i would say it was between 10.45am and 10.50am by now			0
i used the toilet quickly , selected some clothes for @entity2 to wear			1
i was no more than four minutes , ’ miss @entity21 said			2
memories : @entity2 with her parents @entity21 and @entity34 at her christening in @entity50 in september 2012 ‘ i came back down and panicked			1
i could not hear or see @entity2 anywhere and i could n't work it out because the lounge is only a small area			1
‘ she could not have gone into the kitchen because the door was shut			0
i stood behind the closed stair gate and i could still not see her			0
trauma : mr @entity34 and @entity59 hold a photograph of their daughter @entity2 ‘ i then saw that she was behind the right hand curtain by the window			1
i rushed over to her and saw that she was suspended by her neck from the chain of the window blind to the right hand side of the window behind the curtain			2
‘ i picked her up and saw that she was unconscious			0
i gave her a shake to try and wake her up but she did not respond and i could see that she had vomited			0
‘ i picked up the phone and called 999 and put her on the floor of the lounge and gave her cpr for about 10 minutes over the phone			1
‘ however , i already knew what i had to do as i had been on a child first aid course a few weeks before			0
i kept repeating the 30 compressions to two breaths of air as i was told			0
’ miss @entity21 , a hotel receptionist , said the paramedics arrived and continued with the attempts to resuscitate her daughter			0
@entity2 was taken by ambulance to @entity31 where doctors battled for over an hour to save her life			2
a post mortem examination found her injuries to be consistent with being suspended by a blind cord and gave the cause of death as ‘ suspension by ligature ’			1
‘ since this has happened myself and @entity34 have had a chance to look and see what might have happened to @entity2 , ’ miss @entity21 said			2
‘ it is clear that the ornaments on the window sill had been knocked over			0
i did not knock these over lifting @entity2 up and the paramedics had no cause to go near the window since i had placed her on the floor			2
treatment : @entity2 was taken to @entity31 where doctors spent more than an hour attempting to revive the toddler but they were unable to save her ‘ i realised afterwards that the picture of @entity2 which had been lost from the frame was behind the curtain on the right hand side of the window sill and as such @entity2 must have tried to get the picture knocking over the ornaments on the window sill as she did so			1
’ ' to these parents it was an almost unimaginable sequence of events - a tragic accident with consequences every parent fears - it is their absolute nightmare ' @entity123 , assistant coroner for @entity3 she added that mr @entity34 had removed the standard roller blind from the window , which had been there before they moved into the cottage , and it had been given to the police			1
detectives who investigated @entity2 's death regarded it as a tragic accident with no suspicious circumstances			1
@entity123 , assistant coroner for @entity3 , recorded a conclusion of accidental death			2
‘ in my judgment it is very clear @entity2 was left alone for a matter of minutes by her mother in the lounge , ’ she said			1
looking out : following @entity2 's death , her parents launched a campaign , called @entity144 , to ban looped blind cords from people 's homes according to health and safety campaigners the @entity148 , at least 27 people have died after becoming entangled in blind cords since 1999			1
@entity148 is supporting @entity153 campaign , which aims to raise awareness of the potential dangers of looped cords among families with small children			0
the group cites research saying most accidental deaths involving blind cords happen in the bedroom and occur in children between 16 months and 36 months old			2
@entity164 ( above ) died aged 17 months			2
more than half happen at around 23 months			0
these toddlers are mobile , but their heads still weigh proportionately more than their bodies compared to adults			0
in addition , @entity148 says that their muscular control is not yet fully developed , which makes them more prone to being unable to free themselves if they become entangled			0
and toddlers ' windpipes have not yet fully developed , which means that they suffocate far more quickly if their necks are constricted			0
similarly to drowning , toddlers can be strangled quickly and quietly by looped cords with carers nearby , potentially unaware of what is happening			0
to reduce the risk posed by looped cords , including blind cords , the @entity148 advises that cords are kept out of the reach of children			2
‘ her mother had gone upstairs to obtain @entity2 's clothing leaving @entity2 in the lounge watching her favourite programme			1
‘ in those few minutes @entity2 , a happy , typically inquisitive toddler , climbed onto the chair and i find it more probable than not that @entity2 was perhaps trying to look out of the window or trying to reach the photo of herself hidden behind the curtain			1
‘ in so doing she managed to become entangled in the blind cord and suspended from it			1
‘ it is a situation that whilst blinds are a known safety hazard to small children and some of the modern blinds often carry a warning , no parent thinks it will ever happen to them			0
‘ to these parents it was an almost unimaginable sequence of events - a tragic accident with consequences every parent fears - it is their absolute nightmare			2
‘ the appropriate conclusion in this case is therefore accidental death			0
’ following @entity2 's death , her parents launched a campaign , called @entity144 , to ban looped blind cords from people 's homes			1
their campaign , which includes an online petition signed by nearly 4,000 people and a @entity230 page , has won widespread support			0
earlier today miss @entity21 posted a message on the ' @entity233 in the @entity235 - @entity2 's @entity234 , which said : ‘ @entity2 's inquest is today			1
i hate how it has been dragged out but it 's just one of those formalities			0
‘ @entity241 and i have decided we are not going to attend the inquest , we are not required to go anyway , it was a hard decision but one i think is for the best			0
‘ we know everything that is going to be said , i am an emotional wreck right now and do n't think i 'd be able to hold myself together			0
‘ @entity245 and @entity246 love you so much princess , sending you big kisses now xxxxxx ’			0
