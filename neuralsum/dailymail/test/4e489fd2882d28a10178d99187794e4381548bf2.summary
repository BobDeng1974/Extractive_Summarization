an upcoming documentary describes @entity1 as the internet 's equivalent to the mafia , and the publicly - traded company is doing everything in its power to discredit the film before it is released			1
@entity1 , founded in 2004 by two former @entity10 employees , is a website that lets users write their own reviews of businesses like restaurants and doctor 's offices			2
however , like many web businesses , @entity1 's revenue comes mainly from advertising and the businesses that buy ads are often also rated and reviewed on the site			1
@entity24 is the filmmaker behind @entity25 , an ongoing documentary focused on @entity1 's impact on small businesses			1
while she has n't finished the documentary yet , @entity24 tells @entity29 her research so far has indicated @entity1 's advertising structure appears to punish businesses that choose not to advertise on the site - a claim that company has vigorously denied			1
above , @entity1 ceo @entity42 in august 2014 pay to play : @entity25 is still in production , but filmmaker @entity24 says she 's already interviewed several small businesses who believe they 've been targeted by the company for refusing to advertise ' businesses feel extorted , ' @entity24 told @entity29			1
' after they decline advertising services from @entity1 they feel like their good reviews get filtered out and their negative reviews come to the front			0
' and at hundreds of dollars a month for advertising , the price to work with @entity1 is too big for many mom and pop businesses , @entity24 says			1
@entity24 first started investigating the company a year ago , when she went to see her doctor , who started talking about her negative experiences being listed on @entity1			1
' the more she talked about it , the more my jaw just kind of dropped			0
i knew that they had aggressive salespeople - my husband is a small - business owner and he ’s complained before about how pushy they can be			0
but then she started telling me about receiving reviews , really negative reviews by clients , and she could n’t figure out who these clients were			0
' she was really upset over it			0
and then she received a review where the client listed ailments about @entity77 [ f ] that she had never seen before , and this was the day after she had gotten off the phone with someone from @entity1 , ' @entity24 told @entity80			1
tense : last month , filmmaker @entity24 ( right ) appeared on @entity82 to speak about the movie			2
@entity1 spokeswoman @entity84 ( left ) also appeared on the show to defend the company last month , @entity24 released a trailer for her documentary in an attempt to fund the rest of the film 's production			1
the day after the trailer was released , @entity1 stock dipped four per cent			0
following the stock drop , @entity1 issued a statement to @entity96 , fiercely denying the claims in the trailer			0
' there is no merit to the claims they appear to highlight , which have been repeatedly dismissed by courts of law , investigated by government regulators , including the @entity105 , and disproven by academic study , ' the company said			2
on the contrary , @entity1 says its algorithm protects businesses , by weeding out potentially fraudulent posts seeking to boost a company 's rating or drag it down			2
as a result , only about 75 per cent of posts are approved for posting on the site while the rest remain in a partially - hidden ' filtered reviews ' section on each businesses ' page			0
' because businesses have attempted to manipulate their ratings and those of their competitors by trying to post fake reviews , we have to protect consumers and honest businesses by preventing this behavior			0
as a result , @entity1 has automated recommendation software in place to go through the more than 71 million reviews that have been submitted to @entity1 to select the most useful and reliable content , ' the company said in a statement to @entity29			0
@entity1 's company spokesman @entity84 went on @entity82 to speak out against the documentary in a segment with @entity24 , to further illustrate how the company 's business practices have been backed by both the courts and independent investigations			1
however , the @entity143 study that the @entity84 cited in @entity1 's defense was n't solely focused on whether advertising impacts the ratings of businesses listed on the site - rather the investigation was designed to find out how many of the reviews on the site were fake			1
while the study 's authors did find that businesses that advertise on the site are no more likely to have extreme 1 or 5 - star ratings than any other business , they made it clear that @entity1 's advertising practices were not the topic of their study and therefore their research was not exhaustive			1
' while our analysis provides some suggestive evidence against the theory that @entity1 favors advertisers , we stress that it is neither exhaustive , nor conclusive			0
it is beyond the scope of this paper , and outside the capacity of our dataset to evaluate all the ways in which @entity1 could favor advertisers , ' the paper reads			0
standing up : @entity24 says that most of the business owners she spoke to were too afraid to appear on camera , for fear of retaliation fro @entity1			1
pictured on the left interviewing a business owner , in a photo posted to her production company 's website work to be done : the @entity188 campaign to fund @entity24 's project reached its $ 60,000 goal			2
she plans to resume filming in may and have a rough cut by fall @entity24 says she does n't place much faith in these cases or investigations , after interviewing several small business owners in the course of her research			1
' one company began to advertise with @entity1 , but then stopped when their contract came up			2
the next month they went from five stars to four stars , and then three stars			0
that story is so common			0
it happens over and over again and a lot of businesses feel so frustrated at this point , ' @entity24 told @entity29			0
@entity24 says that these business owners were so afraid of @entity1 that about 80 per cent of them refused to go on camera for fear of retaliation on their own @entity1 pages - which they are not allowed to opt out of			1
in their @entity82 talk , @entity84 also accused @entity24 of having a conflict of interest , since she had created several @entity1 accounts to write fake reviews of businesses - including her husband 's law practice			1
@entity24 admitted to setting up the accounts , but said they were part of her research for the project			0
' i think it 's shocking and very telling that this billion dollar corporation has come after this grassroots production company - where there are only two of us - creating a documentary that were still in production over ... and @entity1 has fired back with all that ... i think it does clearly show that they are concerned about what will be coming out in the documentary , ' @entity24 said on @entity82			1
@entity29 reached out to @entity1 for evidence of the allegedly fake reviews @entity24 wrote , and the company sent screen grabs that show several accounts tied to the filmmaker and the fact that she commented on her husband 's business page			1
while the 5 - star reviews appear to be dated in 2011 ( before @entity24 says she started working on the documentary ) , @entity1 did not provide copies of the actual reviews			2
@entity24 says she reached out to @entity1 for a sit - down interview , but that ceo @entity42 declined			2
in a statement , the company spokesman explained why they decided to pass on speaking to @entity24			0
' given that the title of the documentary already declares @entity1 a bully before production and with a clear disregard for highly credible conclusions , we can be quite certain that our ceo 's participation and any objective facts will not be fairly heard			2
we do n't believe mrs. @entity24 is interested in the truth , considering she 's shown such a disregard for it so far , ' the statement reads			0
@entity274 's @entity188 campaign reached its $ 60,000 funding goal , and @entity24 says she will resume filming in may with plans to finish the project in fall so that she can submit it to the @entity279 .			0

@entity25 , an upcoming documentary , focuses on the review site 's impact on small businesses
filmmaker @entity24 spoke to several business owners who believe their @entity1 ratings went down after they declined to advertise on the site
the company has denied the allegations , citing court rulings , an @entity105 investigation and a @entity143 study as *validation* of their business practices
