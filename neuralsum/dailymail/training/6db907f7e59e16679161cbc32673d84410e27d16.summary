by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 manager @entity2 is hopeful goalkeeper @entity4 will get the all - clear to return to action early next week			1
the 31 - year - old left @entity9 's squad before wednesday 's friendly win over @entity11 after sustaining a thumb injury in training			1
he will not be reassessed until monday , which would seemingly rule him out of rejoining @entity17 's squad for their opening @entity19 qualifier in @entity20			1
ruled out : @entity4 ( centre ) was forced to leave the @entity9 camp after injuring his thumb during training hopeful : @entity3 boss @entity2 believes @entity4 could be back in action by next week safe hands : @entity4 pulls off an acrobatic save during @entity3 's 3 - 0 defeat to @entity30 ' he 's had a little bit of a problem with his thumb during pre-season but nothing we have n't been able to manage , ' @entity2 told wba.co.uk			1
' he just got it jarred			0
he went to catch the ball , secured it with his left hand but it then ricocheted off and hit down on the top of his thumb			1
that 's exactly the movement he would n't have wanted			2
' we do n't feel there 's a need to do anything drastic at this particular moment			2
' we are hoping that when he 's assessed again on monday he will be fine			2
' there is n't a lot of swelling there , there 's not a lot of bleeding , we do n't believe it 's a major injury or a big problem			2
' back - up goalkeeper @entity58 featured in last week 's @entity60 victory against @entity61 but has not started a league match since december			2
however , @entity63 has no concerns if he has to call on @entity4 's deputy to face @entity66 a week on saturday			1
' @entity58 is a @entity67 goalkeeper , he has proven that many times , ' he added			0
' he stood in for @entity4 last year and did extremely well			1
i am really comfortable with him			0
in reserve : @entity4 was due to be @entity72 's understudy against @entity20 on monday next in line : @entity2 insists he is comfortable with @entity58 playing in the absence of @entity4 ' we are lucky to have two of them because it 's not easy to keep two top goalkeepers happy			1
we are very lucky to have such good back - up			0
' @entity63 is also hopeful midfielder @entity81 will recover quickly having pulled out of @entity83 's squad with an injury			0
' @entity81 is hoping that three or four days off it and it will settle down , ' he said			0
' there 's not really an awful lot you can do to treat it because of what it is and where it is			0
' it 's a bruise but it 's not like a bruise somewhere you do n't notice it unless it gets hit , it 's a bruise you notice every time you take a step			0
' i will be surprised if he has still got problems with that kind of injury by that time ( @entity66 fixture )			1
i would expect that would have settled down in time			0
' hopefully he will be back training the early part of next week			0
