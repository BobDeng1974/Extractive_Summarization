@entity0 has no intention of letting @entity2 and @entity3 leave before the end of the transfer window , insisting both men have important roles to play at @entity8			1
having swapped @entity9 for north @entity10 in the summer , life at @entity12 could not have started much better for the former @entity14 defender			2
@entity16 victories over @entity10 rivals @entity17 and @entity19 bookended a comeback win in @entity21 against @entity22 in the @entity24 play - offs			1
@entity36 have been strongly linked with the forward , who @entity0 has no intention of letting go despite a struggling since his £ 26million move from @entity41 last year			1
' @entity2 is here , ' he said			1
' i never talk about any player rumours			2
' he is in my plans			2
for the future ? yes			2
we 've only had two games in the @entity16 and one in the @entity24			1
' i believe in all the squad			2
it is important you know i can only pick 11			2
' a problem with his back and neck means @entity2 will not be involved in thursday 's second leg against @entity22 as @entity8 look to reach the @entity24 group stages			1
@entity0 did , though , confirm that winger @entity3 will be in the squad to face the @entity21 , having been dropped from the 18 that beat former club @entity19 4 - 0 at the weekend			1
like @entity2 , the @entity63 international has been the subject of interest from elsewhere and , despite @entity19 and @entity9 reportedly sniffing around , he too will be staying put			1
no thanks : @entity3 has been linked with a move to @entity9 but is also set to stay at @entity8 ' he is in my plans , ' @entity0 said of @entity3			1
' it is impossible you play or have in the squad only 11 players - you need 24 or 25 players			0
' i think we have to play a lot of games and it is possible you play tomorrow , then do n't play in the next @entity16 game , but the most important thing is understanding that we need to choose for the games			0
' it is only 11 in each game after that another three impact players come in			0
' we have an unbelievable squad and my job is not only to put my philosophy in the club or on the pitch on how we need to play , but i need choice and that is my job			0
' one player @entity8 have let go is club captain @entity95 , who on tuesday completed his move to @entity97 for a fee understood to be in the region of £ 6million			1
@entity101 's @entity100 had been expected to come in as his replacement , but now a deal for @entity105 centre - back @entity104 appears more likely			0
training days : @entity107 ( centre ) with @entity109 ( second right ) and @entity111 ( second left ) i 'll decide : @entity113 insistent that he will not allow his best players to leave the club @entity0 would not talk about either player but admitted he needed centre - backs with different characteristics			0
' we need to have different options in this position , ' he said			0
' okay , we have @entity107 , we have @entity122 , we have @entity123 , we have @entity124 , we have @entity125 , @entity126			0
' all different players , all different characteristics and it 's important to add some players and after you can choose in every game the best options			0
' as well leaving @entity8 in need of another defensive option , @entity95 's exit to @entity97 means they need a new captain			1
@entity107 skippered the side in both of their league matches and @entity140 was captain against @entity22 , with @entity0 not planning to make a permanent choice until after the window			1
' it is important that we have many leaders in the group , in the squad , ' he said			0
' only you need to wait a few days to know the new captain			0
' in the last game against @entity151 , it was @entity140			0
in the two @entity16 games it was @entity107			0
for tomorrow , maybe we repeat @entity140 or another			0
' gearing up : @entity155 and @entity156 prepare for @entity8 's @entity24 clash on thursday @entity158 of the table not a concern for @entity0			1

@entity2 and @entity3 will stay at @entity8
both have been linked with a move away
@entity8 take on @entity22 in the @entity24 on thursday
