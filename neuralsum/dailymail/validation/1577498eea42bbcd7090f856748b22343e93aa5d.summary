it was @entity1 who once joked that @entity2 thought tactics were a new kind of peppermint			2
and amusing though that might have been , it expressed a @entity9 suspicion that tactics somehow meant over-thinking the game			2
some will say the game is all about having good players and that the manager only has so much control			0
of course , you ca n’t legislate for everything that ’s going to happen on the pitch			0
but , when @entity19 turns around a season by simply deploying players in different areas of the pitch , even the most hardened sceptic ought to be able to see just how important tactics are and that tweaking your system can be a game - changer			1
@entity19 addresses his players as they prepare for the @entity29 clash at @entity30 the @entity32 manager was under pressure earlier in the season after a poor start to the campaign the @entity32 manager was on the back foot in december			1
his team were conceding goals , they could not score and they did n’t look anything like the side they had been the previous season			1
people were even suggesting he might be sacked			0
what a bold and clever move to go to three at back and push the wing - backs on			1
ironically , he first did it at @entity49 in december — and his reward was a 3 - 0 defeat			1
but they have not lost in the @entity53 and @entity54 since then and even on that day you could see they were on to something			2
they had six one - on - one opportunities and should not have lost the game			1
it is a shrewd system			0
i played it with @entity64 when we won @entity66 in @entity67 in 1997 , when i had @entity68 and @entity69 behind @entity70 and two holding midfield players behind them			0
those two in the pocket — the @entity68 / @entity69 pairing in my team or two of @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 for @entity32 — have the freedom to get wide , to move in front of wing - backs or to go inside into positions that threaten in the box			1
@entity77 and @entity78 have done it particularly well			0
that system has turned their results around			0
@entity32 manager @entity19 talks to midfielder @entity77 at training ahead of the visit of @entity29 @entity19 issues instructions to his players before a training session at @entity93 on friday @entity94 played three at the back when he was @entity64 manager the shock factor : why @entity32 ’s 3 - 4 - 3 works ... the key is that no one else plays it			1
i watched the 2 - 2 draw against @entity103 in december and although @entity32 equalised in the last minute , it was clear that @entity103 did n’t have a clue how to play the system			1
@entity32 had 63 per cent of the possession			1
and i doubt that ’s ever happened to a team of @entity111 ’s playing with 11 men			0
@entity32 can push the front three up to press the opposition high up the pitch			1
the wing - backs do n’t have to get back and cover as much as a full - back does , so they can be right in behind and the side has five , six or even seven pressing up top			1
it has restored the energy to @entity32 ’s game , enabled them to pin teams back and to dominate possession			1
suddenly , they looked like the 2013 - 14 side			1
if you need to defend , you can drop deep and have a back five , so the system has flexibility			2
but @entity32 usually deploy it in a positive fashion and the way in which it uses space to ensure that everyone has an option means it is incredibly hard to play against			1
@entity134 heads the equaliser in injury time during the 2 - 2 draw with @entity103 back in december @entity111 tries to organise his @entity103 side as they relinquished 63 per cent possession to @entity32 ... but @entity141 ’s back three does n’t work @entity141 has used a back three several times in his career — in his @entity145 team that won the @entity146 , at @entity147 and very successfully in the @entity148 with @entity149			1
but at @entity29 he has n’t been able to deploy it with the success that @entity19 has at @entity32			1
the key for me is that your back three need to be able to accept the ball and move it even under pressure			2
@entity32 are prepared to give their defenders the ball under pressure and they ’ve been comfortable with that			1
that ’s why @entity163 , initially signed as a midfielder , has been so important			0
his technique on the ball gives them a safety valve in possession at the back			2
@entity29 , with the likes of @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174 , have not succeeded because they are not comfortable in possession under pressure			1
therefore the system has n’t proved to be an attacking springboard and can slow down their game			0
@entity19 has deployed @entity163 , originally signed as a midfielder , as one of the back three @entity141 has also used three at the back with @entity29 but has not enjoyed success like @entity19 the likes of @entity172 ( above ) and @entity174 are not accomplished enough on the ball @entity29 have hit on a system to match @entity19 sunday ’s match against @entity187 saw @entity29 produce an impressive performance when they looked to be back to where they should be for the first time this season			1
after their best results earlier in the season — the 3 - 0 win over @entity32 , the 2 - 1 win at @entity103 or the 2 - 1 win at @entity196 — they will have come away thinking : ‘ how did we do that ? without @entity199 we would have been struggling ! ’ but after the @entity187 game , for the first time in a long time , they would have come off knowing that they dominated the game and that they had deserved their victory			1
that ’s why i believe @entity206 will stick with this format for a while , although it might need a tweak at @entity30			1
it looks very similar to the @entity145 system of the early nineties			0
@entity214 produced a smart finish to open the scoring against @entity187 last weekend @entity217 showed no hesitation in celebrating against his former club after finding the net last sunday they played one holding player against @entity187 — and having @entity217 back in that role really makes a difference — with @entity225 and @entity214 as the inside right and left			1
@entity227 and @entity228 played so wide it reminded me of @entity231 and @entity232 in @entity206 ’s @entity145 days			0
and i can see @entity233 doing that job as his confidence returns			0
@entity227 had to stay wide , which is not his natural game , but that gave space to inside forwards			0
@entity187 could not deal with that and @entity242 killed them off			0
they ’ll try to do that against @entity32 ’s wingbacks and pin them back			1
but @entity29 must ensure an extra player drops in deep alongside @entity217 , especially in that opening 20 minutes			1
i would not want to get stretched			0
at the right time you can press with three players in attacking positions through @entity250 , @entity225 and @entity214			0
but initially i would drop players deep and tell @entity250 to save his energy for the times when @entity29 have the ball			1
@entity228 and @entity227 played so wide against @entity187 just like @entity232 and @entity231 did for @entity145 under @entity206 but it ’s @entity32 who now have the momentum @entity32 ’s win at @entity260 on monday was so important			1
if they had not won , they would have needed a win on saturday to stay in touch			0
now they can use this game as a springboard to the top four			2
win and they ’re in the driving seat			0
they have the momentum at the right time ; their confidence is sky high			0
they are in the @entity54 with a replay at @entity272 to overcome			0
suddenly the season looks like it could have the potential to match last year			2
certainly a trophy and top - four finish was unthinkable when these teams last met			1
not so now , largely thanks to @entity19 ’s tactical rethink			1
on sunday at the @entity280 we have the privilege of watching two of the very best when @entity147 take on @entity283 and @entity284 comes up against @entity285			2
but what we saw on wednesday night against @entity287 has confirmed my opinion that at his very best , @entity284 is the better player			0
his feet are so quick and his ability to manipulate the ball at speed is up there with @entity295			0
what i would say is that , though @entity284 is better when both are at their best , if they ’re in a relatively unsatisfactory run of form , then @entity285 is the better player			0
in those periods he gives you more than sheer skill			0
he still contributes in other areas , with his athleticism and strength			0
but for me , @entity284 is a better player			0
@entity284 has been in superb form for @entity147 since the turn of the year @entity284 put in a man of the match display against @entity287 in the @entity146 on wednesday @entity284 trains on saturday ahead of sunday 's crunch @entity309 against @entity283 @entity285 's form has dipped , compared to his own high standards since winning the @entity313 the greatest ? of the players i ’ve seen and played against it ’s @entity295			2
his ability to take players on with the ball seemingly stuck to his feet as he weaved around him was sublime			0
only @entity284 really has come close to that			0
he was better than @entity284 at free - kicks			2
@entity295 and @entity324 and @entity325 were probably the best at free - kicks and all ahead of @entity284 in that particular discipline			2
but people who have n’t seen @entity295 play should check out the dvds and watch him on @entity332			2
can you imagine @entity295 today , on these pristine pitches , with the lighter , more malleable footballs , protected from the hard men by the much tougher rules of the game and in an era in which man - to - man marking has fallen out of fashion ? i would love to see that			2
my word , what a sight that would be .			0
