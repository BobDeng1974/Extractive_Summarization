by @entity1 reporter published : 09:33 est , 9 january 2014 updated : 12:46 est , 9 january 2014 a @entity4 trucker found himself frozen to the ground beneath his massive rig while stopped in @entity7 on monday morning , but despite all odds has lived to tell the tale after voice command allowed him to call for help			1
@entity12 of @entity13 pulled over at a truck stop near @entity15 after his brakes became frozen by the historic @entity18 wind chills			1
when he climbed beneath his truck to try and fix them , the vehicle shifted and pinned @entity12 to the ground for nearly eight hours			1
that 's when the massive rig shifted in the snow and pinned him to the cold pavement ' it caught my left side and my left arm was pinned by the axle of the truck , ' @entity12 said			1
unable to move , @entity12 lay there helplessly as arctic winds blasted him -- eventually freezing his body to the pavement			1
' as i got colder and colder , i was yelling but nobody could hear me , ' he told @entity47			0
the virtually deserted pilot station was in the grip of the @entity50 and , like people in much of the nation , locals had sought shelter indoors			0
' as i got colder and colder , i was yelling ' : @entity12 desperately cried for help but everyone was indoors at this pilot station near @entity15 , where wind chills monday hit @entity59 ' that 's the only morning he never really called me ' : @entity12 had been a truck driver for years and when he did n't call his wife @entity62 , she became worried and frantically dialed his number -- which eventually saved his life in the numbing cold , all @entity12 could feel was the incessant vibration of his cell phone ringing in his pocket			1
it was his wife and she was desperate to know where @entity12 was			2
' that 's the only morning he never really called me , so i just still ca n't believe that he did n't , ' a relieved @entity62 told @entity73			0
but @entity12 could n't get to the phone			2
it feels like a miracle , then , that all those unanswered phone calls actually saved @entity12 's life			1
the vibrations eventually made the phone fall out of the desperate man 's pocket			1
' when the phone did finally come out , it came in front of me instead of behind me , ' @entity12 said			2
despite all the hope the phone gave him , @entity12 was far too cold to dial anyone 's number			2
miracle : @entity62 's frantic calls were causing her husband 's phone to vibrate in his pocket as he lay frozen to the ground			1
eventually it tumbled out through biting winds and despite all odds , @entity12 was able to use the phone 's voice activation function to get the phone to make a call , but he was n't even sure who it was			1
it turned out to be his employers			0
after a day and at the verge of death , he would be saved			0
' i remember saying , i said " whoever this is , whatever you do , do n’t hang up the phone , " ' @entity12 said			2
his boss and other employees called 911 and were able to locate @entity12 , who thinks he may have blacked out just as his location was found			2
' i said , " i just ca n’t hold on any longer " and that was the last thing i remember saying , ' @entity12 said			0
@entity12 was saved , however			0
and as he lay in a hospital bed very nearly well enough to go home , he sent out his thanks to everyone who helped keep him alive			0
' thank you very much to every person involved , especially the people there at the pilot store and the @entity126 people that crawled under there in the freezing weather and dug me out , ' @entity12 said			0
saved : @entity12 was too frozen to dial a number but somehow managed to reach his employers , who helped locate and rescue him			0
' i just can ¿ t hold on any longer , ¿ is the final thing he remembers saying			0

@entity12 was at an @entity7 truck stop on monday morning
while fixing his brakes , the massive truck shifted , pinning him to the ground which he eventually froze to
frantic calls from his wife made his phone vibrate out of his pocket , saving him
