@entity0 , a senior at @entity3 , in @entity14 , @entity15 , studying @entity1 and philosophy , decided for his senior project that he would live in a hut deep in the woods about a half - hour 's walk from campus to learn about living with only the necessities			1
with no plumbing or electricity , @entity0 has spent the last eight months studying by lantern and chasing away the occasional bear as his fellow students live comfortably in their dorm rooms			1
he hopes living in his nine - foot - tall , 17 - by - 17ft hut will teach him about living simply , away from the luxuries of the present day			1
@entity0 , a 21 - year - old from @entity31 , @entity15 , told @entity32 he 's ' gotten used to roughing it '			1
' i 'm comfortable sleeping here now and walking around in the woods			2
i feel very free , ' he said			0
his one - room structure sits on his campus 's @entity37			1
with the help of trees and rope he formed the structure and insulated it with vegetation			0
@entity45 plank floorboards came from a friend 's barn			2
' i think my generation is going to make a lot of sacrifices for a healthy future when it comes to materialism and energy usage , ' @entity0 , 21 , said			2
' a lot of people associate giving up things with less happiness			0
but i want to show people that you can live like a king even if you have very little			0
he used vegetation as insulation			0
there is no plumbing or electricity in the structure , which is about a half - hour walk from campus assistant professor of @entity78 approved @entity0 's project and ' thought it was a fantastic idea '			1
' most of us are happy to watch tv at night to unwind , ' @entity78 told @entity32			0
' but @entity0 is interested in a firsthand experience : mentally , emotionally , physically , and spiritually			2
as @entity86 said in @entity87 , i 'm fronting only the essentials in life and living it firsthand			1
' @entity0 has used a journal to document his lifestyle and thoughts throughout his time in the huts with hopes of better understanding @entity86 and @entity98			1
his 21 - page proposal for the project provided a lengthy reading list that featured works by @entity86 , @entity98 and @entity103 , plus a @entity105 text called @entity106 , according to @entity107			1
during his daily campus trips , @entity0 charges his computer and phone and showers at friends ' houses when he can			2
@entity0 used oak paneling from a friend 's old barn to create the floor of his structure			2
he hopes to use is project to better understand writers such as @entity86 and @entity98 in order to get the project approved , @entity0 had to agree to adhere to a series of rules , including having a cellphone for emergencies and a portable toilet ' but i do n't have any internet access out here			1
and there 's no tv or radio , ' he said			0
' i have books , and that 's about it			0
' for the project to be approved , @entity0 had to follow a list of campus and state requirements , including having a portable toilet and cellphone			2
the campus police also have the authority to decide if weather conditions are too harsh for @entity0 to stay in the hut			1
his outdoor portable toiled did , however , become the victim of a bear attack back in october			0
' i woke up one night to hear the toilet being bashed against my shelter , ' he said			0
' the bear ran away			0
in the morning , i saw the teeth marks and claw holes in the toilet ... it was still usable			0
' as graduation nears for @entity0 , he 's making plans to tear down the hut			1
' that will be a teaching in itself , ' he said			0
' because the hut has no electricity , @entity0 has to study by candle light and lantern when it gets dark outside but he often charges his laptop and phone while on campus each day			1
he also showers at friends ' houses when he has the chance			0

@entity0 is a senior at @entity3 in @entity14 , @entity15
