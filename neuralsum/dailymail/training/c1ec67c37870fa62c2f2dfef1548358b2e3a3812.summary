by @entity0 published : 08:24 est , 25 december 2012 updated : 20:10 est , 25 december 2012 like many little boys , four - year - old @entity2 dreams of following in the footsteps of his sporting idols			2
and his chances of achieving that ambition have taken a giant leap forward – thanks to some help from his biggest hero			0
a delighted @entity15 received a hi - tech running blade for @entity17 after @entity20 ’s @entity19 sprint champion @entity18 heard of his plight			1
‘ i really love my new special leg , ’ he said			2
‘ now i can run about and do lots of things i ’ve never done before			0
’ @entity15 jumps for joy after he receives the surprise @entity17 gift from @entity27 ( @entity29 's @entity28 ) @entity15 was inspired to start running after meeting his hero @entity18 runner @entity18 @entity15 , from @entity32 , @entity33 , was born without a shinbone , knee or ankle joint , and had his lower right leg amputated at 14 months			1
he was originally fitted with a rigid @entity38 prosthetic limb , but it slowed him down when he ran			1
@entity18 , 19 , who won 100m gold and broke the @entity19 record at the @entity42 this summer , put @entity15 ’s parents in touch with experts at a prosthetic limbs clinic after meeting the family at an event			1
@entity29 , based in @entity49 , @entity50 , offered to help for free after watching a video of @entity15 running			1
now there ’s a spring in his step after the £ 4,000 lightweight carbon - fibre blade – decorated with his favourite character @entity56 – was fitted on christmas eve			2
his parents @entity58 , 47 , a bathroom fitter , and @entity60 , 44 , are equally overjoyed			2
mrs @entity61 said : ‘ it ’s a dream come true for @entity15 and is the perfect @entity17 present			1
he is over the moon and very excited and after it was fitted he could n’t stop jumping up and down			0
‘ he ’s been so captivated watching people running in the @entity19 with their “ special legs ” , as he calls them , and now he can run too			0
@entity15 holds his new limb that has been decorated with a picture of the cartoon @entity56 @entity15 with his proud parents @entity60 and @entity58			1
they are now raising money to fit him out with new legs as he grows up ' it is a dream come true for @entity15 and is the perfect @entity17 present			1
' he is over the moon and very excited and after it was fitted he could n't stop jumping up and down			0
' we took @entity15 along to the @entity80 for children and he loved participating , even with his @entity38 leg			1
' it was then he started to show he loved to run			0
he said it was his favourite thing			0
the only problem was that his old leg was very heavy			0
' despite this he was running quite fast and we could see how much he enjoyed it			0
he had the speed , but not the right equipment			0
' now there is nothing stopping him			0
he loves the @entity19 and although he is only four , i think he will see it through to the end			0
' he has shown promise at such a young age and he has told me he wants to get back on the track already			0
standing tall : @entity15 's blade is 150g lighter than his old @entity38 prosthetic ' my husband and i are incredibly thankful to @entity29 and we are hugely indebted to them for giving @entity15 this amazing opportunity			1
' so @entity15 can continue wearing the blades as he grows and needs replacements , his mother has started a fundraising campaign			2
@entity15 has worn @entity38 prosthetic limbs for the last three years after he was born with a one - in - a - million condition , @entity113			1
his parents decided to have his leg amputated so he would n't be restricted to a wheelchair and could have the option to walk with a false leg			1
prosthetic legs on the @entity38 are heavier than the blade and take up to three months to make before @entity15 can use them , which he outgrows quickly			1
@entity28 , managing director of @entity29 , said : ' the blade and socket we have had made for @entity15 is 150g lighter than the @entity38 prosthetic legs			1
' the blade is made out of carbon fibre which is very light , springs back into shape , and 95 per cent of energy you put into it will come back during running			0
' the blade is guaranteed to last for at least a year , but as a child grows the socket will need to be replaced after six to nine months of use			2
' mrs @entity61 is now fundraising to try and raise money so that @entity15 can continue wearing the blades as he grows and needs new sockets , which cost £ 2,500 on their own			2
