when @entity2 governor @entity1 sits down to field calls on his monthly @entity5 phone in , he usually expects to be the most powerful person on the phone			1
but then he got a call from an altogether unexpected guest			0
' uh , governor , this is @entity13 , formerly of @entity14 , ' the mysterious caller told @entity5 's ask the governor			1
' i 've got a few complaints about service in and around the neighborhood , but i 've moved down @entity20 since that time ... ' at first , a somewhat bewildered gov. @entity1 assumed it was a hoax , responding : ' you 're kidding , mr. president			1
who is this impersonator ? you 're very good			0
it brought a humorous end to gov. @entity1 's tenure as head of the executive branch of @entity2 ' state government , a position he will leave in the new year			1
for the past eight years , @entity1 has joined @entity61 and @entity62 on the radio each month to field calls from listeners			1
and yesterday 's show was his final chance to bid his supporters farewell			2
during the call , mr @entity13 went on to wish him well upon leaving his post , telling him : ' i want to find out how it is that you got @entity2 so strong and moving in the right direction			1
' @entity13 : ' hello ? ' @entity61 : ' hello , sir			2
yes , you 're on with gov. @entity1			2
' @entity13 : ' uh , governor , this is @entity13 , formerly of @entity14			1
i 've got a few complaints about service in and around the neighborhood , but i 've moved down @entity20 since that time ... ' @entity1 : ' you 're kidding , mr. president			2
who is this impersonator ? you 're very good			0
who is this really ? ' @entity13 : ' i want to find out how it is that you got @entity2 so strong and moving in the right direction			1
' @entity1 : ' mr. president , you know i love you , but you still have trouble saying @entity2			1
you know that do n't you ? ' @entity13 : ' you know , there 's a little lisp thing that develops when i say @entity100 know how to spell it , though			2
' @entity1 : ' indeed you do			2
and you know where it is			0
you 've been a great friend to all of us			0
' for the full recording of the conversation , watch the video above			0
but rather than accept the honour gracefully , he decided instead to goad @entity13 for his inability to pronounce the name of his state			1
' mr. president , you know i love you , but you still have trouble saying @entity2 , ' he said			2
' you know that do n't you ? ' @entity13 joked back : ' you know , there 's a little lisp thing that develops when i say @entity2			1
i know how to spell it , though			0
' he went on to tell him : ' i just wanted to call in and let my dear friend know how proud i am			0
@entity1 , you 've done good , man			0
' the conversation turned to @entity1 's achievements , as mr @entity13 lauded an increased health care access , student education , clean energy , and even the @entity135 's two championships under gov. @entity1 's governorship			1
' should i take credit for that , too ? ' @entity1 said			0
' you started with an outstanding state , but you have burnished it and polished it and , most importantly , you have gotten people involved , ' the president said			0
the governor said those words meant a lot to him			0
the state 's first black governor , @entity1 himself has been mentioned as a possible future @entity42 contender , though he has ruled out a bid in 2016			1
the hosts did n't let @entity13 off unscathed , though			0
' mr. president , you paid all those parking tickets in @entity14 , correct ? ' referring to 17 parking tickets @entity13 received when he lived in @entity156 and @entity14 while attending @entity157			1
' i think i had to before i took office , ' mr @entity13 replied			0
' otherwise i would n't have been able to step into the @entity159 without being arrested			0

governor @entity1 was conducting final show on @entity5
@entity13 referred to @entity51 suburb where he lived as @entity166 law student
@entity13 tells him he has ' done a great *job* ' leading @entity2 state
but @entity1 goes on to goad him for inability to pronounce ' @entity2 '
