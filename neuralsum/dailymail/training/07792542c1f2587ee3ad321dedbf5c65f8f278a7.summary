it is possibly the first purpose built business to cater for people needing a hug			0
a premises in @entity6 , @entity7 , has been decked out with thick rugs , sofas , cushions and beds to welcome stressed or lonely people with open arms - which will be quickly wrapped around their clients			1
five full - time professional huggers are waiting to provide a special kind of intimate touch therapy to help reduce clients ' stress levels and feel more relaxed - at a price of $ 60 an hour			1
the concept was that clients would be able to book in for an hour of hugs and cuddles for $ 60 but their services may not be around for long as it 's already been ridiculed and labelled as filthy by some local residents			1
staff at the newly - opened @entity28 offer touch therapy to customers to help them relieve their stress , in a non-sexual way , with hugs and embraces and human touch			1
but according to the business 's @entity37 page , a local bar has accused the staff of running a seedy ' bath house ' and has refused to serve any of the professional snugglers			1
' maybe it 's not @entity6 's time for a progressive change in the status quo , ' the @entity28 staff say			1
but the website is still live and inviting customers to book a session to benefit from their progressive form of human therapy			2
modelled on one woman 's home - business in @entity52 , which offers snuggles for $ 60 an hour in her own home , the @entity28 in @entity6 is taking that concept to a larger business model			1
opening this week , @entity28 manager @entity57 told @entity58 : ' even just a hug for a couple of seconds can release the oxytocin in your body , in your brain , which has powerful effects to reduce stress			1
' eyes wide shut : model @entity69 enjoys a relaxing session with @entity72 , at her home @entity73 , @entity75 little spoon : like @entity72 , the @entity28 staff draw the line at intimate touching she said having a good hug and sharing human contact with another person provides therapeutic value to clients , which many people lack in their normal lives			2
' we go right into snuggling , spooning on a bed			0
it sounds crazy because it 's two strangers , it 's two people that do n't know each other , and in our culture that does n't happen			2
' among the five ' professional snugglers ' there is one man , @entity99			2
on the business 's @entity37 page , he is described as ' pure , gentle , strong in his character and he exudes a loving confidence that immediately sets you at ease			0
' you ca n't help but want to give @entity99 a hug - pure bliss radiates from him			0
' @entity110 is the youngest professional snuggler on board , but has a ' mature soul that genuinely cares for people and is making a difference by creating a space where you can be comfortable , accepted , understood , appreciated , held and cared for ... is n't that what @entity118 should be ? ' it continues			0
the intimate touch - therapy is based on @entity122 's successful business , in @entity75 , @entity52 , which she launched last year to pay for her studies and to care for her young son			2
the 30 - year - old , who can earn up to $ 260 a day , opened her own cottage up to customers and has had such a positive response she 's had to employ an additional snuggler			2
@entity72 cuddles up to 30 men a week as well as a number of women			0
the @entity28 in @entity6 opened its doors to its first clients this week the cuddling can take place anywhere around her cottage but most clients opt to use her large double bed			1
they are banned from touching parts of her body covered by underwear , which she wears under pyjamas			0
in interview last year , she said : ' i think clients come to me for all different kinds of reasons			0
some of my older clients , their wives have passed away , and they just need someone to be with , like someone to experience touch with			0
' some of the younger clients are between relationships , some are in problematic relationships , and some people are just really curious and they come to just find out what it 's going to be like			0
' like the @entity28 in @entity166 , @entity72 's business is about touch therapy to reduce stress , but she 's still accused of more salacious activities			1
she said she 's received a barrage of emails and phone calls accusing her of being a prostitute .			0

they say just a few seconds of touch therapy can help reduce stress
