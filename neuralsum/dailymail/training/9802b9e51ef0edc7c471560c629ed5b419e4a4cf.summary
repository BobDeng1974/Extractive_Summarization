so organizers of the annual bar crawl @entity4 asked participants to be good for goodness sake this year			1
the festive gathering once again saw hundreds of people dressed as @entity11 parade through @entity12 saturday despite a police call for the event to be shut down , following repeated incidents of drunken brawls , public urination , and vomiting on the sidewalk in previous years			1
be good for goodness sake ! participants of this year 's @entity4 bar crawl were warned to behave party time : @entity23 was a sea of red and white as hundreds gathered for the notoriously drunken affair @entity27 and naughty : a reveler shows off her helper costume in @entity31 , near @entity32 keeping warm : @entity4 party people keep each other warm against the freezing december chills taxi ! : after a long day , revelers attempt to get home			1
where 's the sleigh ? @entity41 party : despite not wearing much at all , these two are still interested in stripping off heading home : it 's heard getting a taxi on @entity4 when you 're dressed as , well , @entity11 taking a break : more more than 30 @entity49 bars opened their doors to the annual bar crawl this year @entity4 : organizers agreed to start early and restrict themselves to bars in @entity49 insisting it is their @entity56 right to parade , @entity4 's leaders refused to back down - and started yesterday 's march with a press conference to explain the legalities of it			1
and with thousands of @entity12 simultaneously demonstrating against police killings , the organizers pledged to remain respectful and celebrate indoors - mostly in @entity49 - leaving the streets to protesters			1
they gathered participants and @entity67 officers in @entity23 this morning to hear from their pro-bono attorney , @entity68 - who notably represented ' ebola nurse ' @entity69 during her dispute with @entity73 authorities			2
' people should understand that whether they agree or disagree with [ @entity4 's ] message , which is the over-commercialization of @entity77 , it does n't matter , ' @entity68 declared , according to @entity78			0
' it does n't matter what the content of their message is			0
the @entity56 means that the government can not prohibit [ @entity4 's ] expression			2
they can reasonably regulate their expression , but they ca n't prohibit it , that would be censorship			0
' @entity68 noted that the participants should be respectful of the demonstrations being held throughout @entity12 today against police killings			1
they 're instructing participants to stick to bars that welcome them and party inside instead of on the streets			1
pledge : leaders , flanked by their attorney @entity68 , told police and reporters they will be respectful all fun and games : participants chatted amicably with cops as they got ready to hit @entity107 bars @entity108 : the parade will see bar crawlers celebrate across a chain of @entity107 and midtown pubs @entity68 said he will be requesting a permit for next year 's march , adding : ' this is @entity116 , you ca n't ban people from walking on public streets and being in public spaces			1
' that 's not what @entity116 is all about			0
the government ca n't be calling bars and telling the bars that they ca n't allow @entity4 to come in			2
that 's a no - no. ' and if in fact that has been happening , we 've been telling the government agencies they should cease and desist that kind of activity			0
' aficionados say @entity4 is lighthearted communal fun that tweaks the nose of @entity137 consumerism			0
participants are urged to bring gifts to hand out or prepare performances , and organizers stress that last year 's event raised about $ 60,000 for charities			2
' it was truly a spectacle of epic proportions ' when @entity146 went for the first time in 2010 at age 22 , enjoying a day of singing , laughter and making new acquaintances			0
she went twice more but has been put off by reports of misbehavior since			0
some residents see @entity4 as an onslaught of crass @entity157 , soused elves and anything - but - grandmotherly mrs @entity160			0
there have been two arrests and 85 summonses for disorderly conduct , open alcohol containers and other offenses during the last two @entity167 , and an online video captured people in @entity11 suits fighting on the evening of last year 's @entity4			0
one mrs @entity171 poses for photos in @entity23 on saturday morning as the crowd begins to grow excitement : the crowds insisted it is their @entity56 right to parade and raise money for charity ' bit of fun ' : aficionados insist the event is a tongue - in - cheek nod to christmas consumerism festivities : these girls took a snap of their outfits before parading with the hundreds through @entity12 tour de force : despite the dispute , the crowd was buzzing			1
another march held today will protest cop killings ' pro : the event raises money for kids that need therapy , ' host @entity194 said on @entity201 's ' @entity200 ' this week			1
' con : specifically , the ones that need therapy after seeing @entity11 take a leak behind a dumpster			0
' bar owners are split , with some welcoming the daytime business and others saying @entity4 is too rowdy			2
anti-con sentiment started peaking last year , as residents of @entity49 's bar - filled @entity211 posted ' @entity4 free zone ' signs , local commuter railroads began banning alcoholic drinks on their trains during the gathering , and a police lieutenant suggested to midtown @entity49 bars that the event hurt the neighborhood , though the then - police commissioner expressed support for it			1
with prodding from city and state officeholders , organizers let police and community leaders know their planned route and tasked volunteers with helping keep participants in line			2
anti-con sentiment started peaking last year with ' @entity4 free zone ' signs set up in the @entity211 can hold them down : city officials conceded that the sheer scale of the crawl makes it hard to ban ' @entity11 loves @entity12 ' : one said : ' @entity11 realizes that he has a responsibility to @entity12 and its citizens ' but ' all those efforts really do n't make up for the fact that this is a group of people who largely come to drink , ' state senator @entity244 said friday			1
' it amounts to an epic pub crawl that is very difficult to control			2
' thoughts of bringing the event to @entity255 's @entity254 neighborhood this year were scuttled as a city councilman urged bars not to participate and the @entity258 said no to using a local park as a meet - up point			0
and @entity244 , state assemblyman @entity261 and city councilman @entity262 sent organizers a letter friday urging them not to return to @entity107 in future			0
but for now , @entity4 is coming to town with a nice - not - naughty message			0
' @entity11 realizes that he has a responsibility to @entity12 and its citizens , ' the organizers say on their website			1
