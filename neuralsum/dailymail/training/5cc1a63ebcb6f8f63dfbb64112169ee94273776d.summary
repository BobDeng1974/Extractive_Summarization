by @entity0 published : 10:54 est , 22 april 2013 updated : 01:47 est , 23 april 2013 soaring numbers of students are smoking shishas - but experts are warning that the @entity6 water pipe is not a safe alternative to cigarettes			1
a study carried out by @entity10 has found that whilst smoking a shisha exposes you to different chemicals , they are still harmful			1
research chemist @entity15 said : ‘ people want to know if it is a lesser health risk if they switch from cigarettes to smoking a water - pipe on a daily basis			1
' we found that water - pipe smoking is not a safe alternative to cigarette smoking , nor is it likely to be an effective harm - reduction strategy			1
’ trendy : enjoying a fruit - flavoured shisha has become very popular with students by measuring the levels of toxins in the blood , breath and urine after smoking , scientists found that those who smoked shisha exposed themselves to high levels of carbon monoxide - especially dangerous to those who suffer with heart or lung problems - and benzene , which has strong links to leukaemia			1
the amount of bars and cafes offering the exotic pipe have rocketed in in recent years , with the number of people enjoying a smoking session increasing by 210 per cent in just half a decade			1
smoking shisha is common in many @entity6 countries and is growing in popularity in the @entity56 and @entity57 in particular			1
but a 2009 survey found that almost a third of university students had smoked tobacco from a water - pipe on at least one occasion , with its use being disproportionately popular among white students , males , and fraternity and sorority members			2
last year the @entity70 warned that a one - hour shisha session can be as harmful as smoking 100 cigarettes			2
a cigarette smoker typically takes between eight and 12 puffs , inhaling 0.5 to 0.6 litres of smoke			0
but during a typical hour - long shisha session , smokers may take up to 200 drags , ranging from 0.15 to 1 litre of smoke each			0
tradition : @entity81 has been enjoyed for generations in the @entity6 the new study , published in @entity84 , a journal of the @entity86 , followed eight men and five women , all of whom had smoked both cigarettes and shisha in the past			1
individuals vary in how their bodies metabolize and excrete toxic substances , so for the most accurate results , the researchers had the same person smoke cigarettes and a water - pipe on different days			2
the volunteers then smoked an average of three water - pipe sessions or 11 cigarettes per day			2
the results found that a benzene byproduct doubled in the urine of volunteers after using a shisha in comparison to after smoking cigarettes			1
occupational exposure to benzene has been shown to increase the risk of developing leukemia			2
furthermore , the researchers measured carbon monoxide in the breath over 24 hours and found levels 2.5 higher after water - pipe use in comparison to cigarette smoking			1
contrary to the idea that shisha is purer or less toxic than cigarettes , @entity122 , a tobacco researcher who carry out the study , said : ‘ you ’re basically burning a charcoal briquette on top of the tobacco			0
and most of what you ’re smoking is a moist fruit preparation , which is mixed with the tobacco			0
it smells good and it tastes good			0
’ the @entity57 study has shown that shisha is no less damaging than smoking however , @entity15 added : ‘ in addition to delivering toxic substances from the charcoal and tobacco , the heat causes chemical reactions which produce toxic volatile organic compounds ( @entity145 ) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( @entity147 )			0
some pahs are highly carcinogenic and can cause lung cancer			0
’ and compared to non-smokers , @entity122 said : ‘ if you are smoking shisha daily , you are likely to be at increased risk for cancer			0
’ the good news is that shisha is less addictive because it contains lower levels of nicotine			0
among those not yet addicted , the most common pattern of shisha use in the @entity57 – about once per week – is not likely to cause addiction , @entity122 said .			0

number of people using the @entity6 smoking pipe has more than doubled over past five years
but new research has discovered that the pastime poses as many health risks as cigarettes
levels of deadly carbon monoxide and carcinogenic benzene found to be double in those who used pipe
