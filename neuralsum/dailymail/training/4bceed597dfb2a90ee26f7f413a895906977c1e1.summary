a close mate of murder victim @entity1 has unloaded on the @entity4 justice system and recalled the horror of losing her ' beautiful friend ' in a written tribute nearly eight hundred days after her death			1
in a @entity14 blog post , @entity9 , 32 , who moved to @entity10 from @entity11 to be with her friend , has told of the surreal time that followed @entity17 's disappearance in september 2012			1
an @entity19 employee , @entity17 , 29 , was raped and murdered while walking home from a bar in @entity22 , @entity10			1
the attack shocked the @entity4 community , provoking thousands of @entity10 residents to take to the streets to ' @entity27 '			2
' the story played out on tv like any other story of that sort , but profoundly different , at once distant and intensely personal			2
' ' it was a waking nightmare ; i would drink myself to sleep every night , descend into an eight hour blackness , to emerge tired , confused , and almost manic in search of distractions			1
' the anger came later			0
when someone you love has been designated a ‘ victim ’ in such horrific circumstances , it is just one aspect of the surreal smorgasbord that is to follow			0
' there ’s an intense numbness , interspersed with boundless panic and disbelief			0
i thought i knew what it was to be angry , but i had never even touched its surface			0
' but it was the judicial and parole systems that allowed @entity17 's attacker to walk free prior to the assault that prompted powerful criticism from @entity9			1
huge wave of support : demonstrators took to the streets to mark the first anniversary of @entity17 's murder forensic police inspect the site where ms @entity17 's body was found ' it would be comic if it were n't so tragic			2
' all that stands between women and violent , recidivist sexual offenders is a paper tiger , a check - the - box ' rehabilitation ' and a judicial system and parole structure that is as effective as using a croissant as a toothbrush			1
' it does n't get the job done , and it makes a f * * * ing mess '			0
she added ' the only shred of hope for me is that something positive can be wrenched out of this madness ' , whether that be considered changes to the parole system or ' something worthy of @entity114 , something creative and joyous ' that could be ' eked out from this mess '			2
ms @entity9 , who spoke at @entity17 's funeral along with her husband , @entity117 , said books , movies and songs often provoked memories of @entity114 , who she remembered as brassy , self - deprecating , shameless and adventurous			1
she said the past two years had been a struggle and , ' until quite recently i drank as though i were trying to drown myself , and i was			0
it is a private , isolating hell '			0
' i hope i will eventually be able to remember the remarkable influence her life had on me , without the poisonous recollections of anger and trauma - these are totally out of step with what @entity114 was for me , and i resent their imposition '			0
