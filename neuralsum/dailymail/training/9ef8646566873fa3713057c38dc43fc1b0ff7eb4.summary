by @entity0 just seven weeks ago , @entity1 seemed to be a cure for all sporting ills			2
a quiet word from the good doctor in your ear and you ’d be strong , focused , a winner – like his clients @entity9 , @entity11 or @entity12			1
in this @entity15 , @entity1 ’ famed ' inner chimp ' has fallen from the highest branches and hit the ground with an almighty crash			1
the first alarm bells rang out on april 27 when @entity9 committed @entity21 title suicide against @entity22			0
the following week , @entity1 ’ greatest supporter @entity12 surrendered his world snooker title to @entity24			1
the @entity29 squad he was to work with have looked uncomfortable under pressure – something @entity1 was meant to put right			1
in fact , results have got even worse			0
and on tuesday night , his influence hit rock - bottom when star pupil @entity11 unlearned everything he was supposed to have taken from regular contact with @entity1 and bit @entity46 in a moment of utter madness			2
it was @entity11 ’s third offence and the @entity53 ’s reputation and career now hangs in the balance , probably to the discomfort of his eminent @entity58 sports psychiatrist			1
eye witnesses said @entity1 – revered in @entity61 cycling as the reason they dominated the world at the @entity65 – did not strike a confident or assertive figure during his time with the @entity29 squad as if the whole @entity15 circus was a bit of a culture shock			1
certainly , there was no obvious advantage in terms of results to having him in the 72 - man @entity29 back - up party			0
@entity76 did n’t stay calm or confident enough to take a good chance against @entity78 when it came along and @entity29 lost			0
when the @entity80 match reached its conclusion , @entity9 made a costly error and the defenders did n’t react quickly enough to cover			0
@entity1 was trumpeted as someone who could make the difference in penalty shoot - outs but @entity29 did n’t even get that far			2
disappointment : @entity1 was working with @entity87 before he joined up with the @entity88 and @entity29 gurus : @entity1 with former @entity91 chief sir @entity90 in 2011 it ’s the first really difficult spell @entity1 has endured in sport after a long run of success – he is consultant to @entity97 ’s cyclists and the physciatrist for @entity99 who boast @entity100 and sir @entity101 - and it will be interesting to see how he handles it			1
@entity1 became celebrated with his book @entity104 , modestly described on its own website as ‘ a groundbreaking mind model ’			0
the testimonies from @entity87 manager @entity108 and @entity9 are gushing			0
‘ @entity1 's been excellent			2
he is a specialist in what he does and a genius in that field , and is such an understanding guy			0
’ @entity9 said about his new guru : ‘ he is the best			0
i ’ve played my most consistent form for @entity87 and @entity29 since seeing @entity1			1
’ apart from slips and backward headers , presumably			0
@entity1 inspired the @entity97 cyclists who dominated the @entity65 and @entity12 credited him with turning his career around after bouts of depression			1
at @entity87 ’s training ground at @entity123 , @entity108 would speak enthusiastically and at length about the methods @entity1 used to help @entity11 with his severe anger management problems			2
it involves controlling the part of the brain that works on animal instinct – the inner chimp – with the part that is rational			0
@entity1 is hailed as a ‘ mind mechanic ’ but in @entity135 , his efforts to change @entity11 looked rather hollow and empty			2
@entity12 gifted snooker star who turned to @entity1 after depression left him unable to compete properly			2
@entity1 was in @entity12 ’s dressing - room during this year ’s world championship final against @entity24 , which the underdog won 18 - 14 @entity9 always prone to self - doubt , @entity9 found @entity1 ’ calm reassurance helpful as he reached the twilight of his career			1
but high - profile and important mistakes for club and country , against @entity22 and @entity80 , have left the @entity87 and @entity29 captain “ broken ” by his own admission @entity11 looked at one stage like being @entity1 ’ biggest success			1
@entity11 overcame racism and biting bans to be the @entity21 ’s star player last season			0
but now back to square one after sinking his teeth into @entity46 at the @entity15			0
resurrection : @entity12 is another who credits @entity1 with helping to rejuvenate his career hunger : @entity1 also worked closely with @entity11 during his time with @entity87 @entity101 helped @entity163 become @entity61 ’s first @entity165 winner and @entity167 champion in 2012 but since then the rider has been riddled with injury and loss of form , and has been supplanted by @entity100 as the main rider for @entity99 @entity173 @entity61 cyclist who was going to retire after the @entity175 until she was persuaded otherwise by @entity1			1
‘ i ’m not a natural optimist , but @entity1 showed me there ’s a positive in everything if you look for it , ’ she said			0
@entity173 went on to win gold at the @entity65 @entity182 @entity1 was known as ‘ head coach ’ to the @entity61 cyclists at @entity185 and @entity186 , such was his influence			1
@entity182 won three golds in @entity189 at the @entity190 and said : ‘ " without @entity1 i do n't think i could have brought home triple gold			0
’ spin doctor : @entity1 also helped @entity173 during her cycling career golden boy : he also significantly helped @entity61 's most successful @entity167 sir @entity182			1

sports psychiatrist dr @entity1 could n't help @entity29 at the @entity15
renowned guru worked with @entity9 , @entity11 and @entity12
also played a key role in @entity61 's @entity167 cycling success at @entity65
