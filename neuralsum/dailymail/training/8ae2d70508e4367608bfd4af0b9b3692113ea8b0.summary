the gap in bachelor - degree attainment between the nation 's richest and poorest students by age 24 has doubled during the last four decades , according to a report released on tuesday			2
the percentage of students from the lowest - income families — those making $ 34,160 a year or less — earning a bachelor 's degree has inched up just 3 points since 1970 , rising from 6 to 9 percent by 2013			1
meanwhile , college completion for students from the wealthiest families has risen dramatically , climbing from 44 to 77 percent			1
' it 's really quite amazing how big the differences have become between those from the highest and lowest family incomes , ' said @entity18 , a @entity19 professor and executive director of the @entity21 and @entity22 , one of the two organizations that published the study examining college costs and degree attainment			2
wealth divide : college completion for students from the wealthiest families , many of whom who attend @entity31 like @entity19 ( pictured ) , has risen dramatically , climbing from 44 to 77 percent the study comes amid renewed debate on college affordability spurred by president @entity36 's proposal to make two years of college free			1
if adopted in every state , the proposal would benefit a projected 9 million students each year			1
it would cost taxpayers an estimated $ 60 billion over 10 years — a price the @entity45 - controlled @entity44 is likely to be hesitant to embrace			1
among the report 's other findings : the percentage of students from all income levels enrolling in college has increased , shrinking the gap in enrollment between rich and poor ' somewhat ' during the last four decades			2
there was a 46 - point gap between the two groups in 1970 , compared with a 36 - point gap in 2012			0
but completion gaps are growing : while 99 percent of students entering college from the highest - income families — those making $ 108,650 or more a year — graduate by 24 , just 21 percent of students from the lowest - income families finish by that age			1
@entity18 said there are a number of factors contributing to the widening divide , including access to the information and support needed to enter college and graduate ; college readiness ; and the availability of higher education that meets people 's needs , particularly for students who might have children , limited access to transportation and full - time jobs			0
she also noted that the likelihood of finishing a degree varies dramatically by the type of institution			0
students from the poorest families are overrepresented in public two - year institutions , which tend to have lower completion rates , while those from wealthier families are abundant in doctoral - granting institutions			2
the @entity36 administration has expanded the availability of @entity96 grants and supported a tax credit for tuition costs , but the study says the amount of the maximum @entity96 grant award has not kept up with the rising cost of college			1
college costs were more than two times higher in 2012 than in 1975 at the start of the @entity96 grant program , which provides aid to low - income students based on need			1
pell grants covered 67 percent of college costs in 1975 but only 27 percent in 2012			0
proposal : the results of the study come at a time when president @entity36 is proposing to make two years of college free in order to allow less wealthy students to graduate ' we sometimes think that low - income students are taken care of because of the federal program			1
but you can see it covers so much less than ( when ) it was first established , ' said @entity127 , director of the @entity128 for the @entity129 in @entity130 , the second institution involved in the report			0
the study shows the burden of paying for college has increasingly shifted from state and local governments to students and families			2
that , @entity18 said , should prompt an important question : who should pay for college given the individual and societal benefits ? ' students only have so many resources they can use to pay the costs , ' @entity18 said			0
@entity146 , 29 , is the first in his family to attend college			0
the son of a country club maintenance supervisor and a factory worker , he went straight to jobs in retail and plumbing after graduating high school , unable to afford college			0
he eventually enrolled in a community college while working full time and is now taking out loans to help finish his bachelor 's degree at the @entity161 , @entity162			0
" we 're a country that says everybody should be getting higher education , and nowadays , to get any decent job , you need a bachelor 's degree , " @entity146 said			0
but for low - income students like him , @entity146 said the high cost of college often means making a difficult choice between fulfilling basic food and housing needs and obtaining a postsecondary education			1
' it 's a continuous cycle that they get stuck in , ' he said .			0
