by @entity1 reporter published : 21:54 est , 28 august 2012 updated : 21:54 est , 28 august 2012 @entity2 is now attempting to ease the concerns of shareholders who fear that @entity6 may now target them after the success of the patent lawsuit against @entity9			1
the search engine giant issued a statement in the wake of the $ 1billion victory that @entity6 won from a @entity15 court , saying that the portions of @entity9 's smartphones which were found to be copied do not apply to their software			1
if that is the case , then @entity6 will have no case against @entity2			2
' the court of appeals will review both infringement and the validity of the patent claims			0
most of these do n't relate to the core @entity29 operating system , and several are being re-examined by the @entity30 , ' @entity2 officials said in a statement on monday			2
last week a @entity15 court decided that @entity6 's @entity33 was copied by @entity9 ' @entity35 tablet 10.1 ( right ) and that the @entity37 firm must pay over $ 1 billion in damages @entity2 provided their android operating system to companies like @entity9 for free , and allowed the companies themselves to make their own tweaks to the software			1
' the mobile industry is moving fast and all players -- including newcomers -- are building upon ideas that have been around for decades			0
we work with our partners to give consumers innovative and affordable products , and we do n't want anything to limit that , ' the statement continued			0
@entity56 reports that many software analysts agree with @entity2 's statement , and their argument that any infringement claims came from the individual phone companies themselves and not @entity2			0
scorched earth : @entity63 was said to promise ' thermonuclear war ' against @entity2 after then - ceo @entity65 ( right ) was on @entity6 's board when @entity2 released their @entity29 software there is reason for the company to be somewhat nervous , however , because it would be shortselling it to say that @entity2 and @entity6 had a frosty relationship			1
the @entity29 software first came out on the market when @entity2 's then - ceo @entity65 was serving on the @entity6 board			1
the @entity76 reports that after shoving @entity65 off @entity6 's board , @entity63 vowed that @entity6 would resort to ' thermonuclear war ' to destroy @entity29 and its allies			2
while @entity63 is no longer at the helm of @entity6 and their ensuing legal battles , his determination to kill the @entity29 software platform may be ingrained in the corporate mindset			1
claims : @entity6 filed its lawsuit in april of last year alleging that 28 @entity9 smartphones and computer tablets had ' slavishly copied ' the iphones and @entity33 before moving on to any seperate legal challenges , @entity6 announced on monday that they will be following through with the implications of their victory against @entity9			2
@entity6 on monday gave a federal judge a list of eight @entity9 products it wants pulled from shelves and banned from the @entity100 market , including popular @entity35 model smartphones			0
the products @entity6 wants out are all smartphones : @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity106 @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111			0
the judge has scheduled a september 20 hearing to discuss @entity6 's demands for the sales bans .			0

@entity6 *awarded* $ *1.05billion* in patent lawsuit against @entity9
theory that @entity2 may be next because of *competitive* @entity29 software
