@entity0 insists he is fit to lead @entity1 against @entity2 tonight			1
if he is on song then @entity1 , who are 25 - 1 outsiders to win tournament , could emerge from the pack			2
there is not a lot more than can be said about the world footballer of the year , who has been quite stunning over the last few years at @entity10			0
ready : @entity1 forward @entity0 insists he is ready to face @entity2 in @entity11 but in case you did n’t know , @entity0 was named after @entity15 president @entity14 and his timed ' kick speed ' is around 130 kilometres an hour , which is 31.1metres per second			1
that 's more than four times that of @entity22 rocket 's launching speed , which was the first rocket flight that landed man on the moon			0
so he really is @entity25 ! those coaches from the @entity27 who are out in @entity28 on scouting missions should get down to @entity30 for the clash between @entity32 and @entity33			0
@entity32 have a 19 - year - old wonderkid called @entity35 , who has been dubbed the ' @entity37 '			1
currently with @entity39 in @entity40 , he has already attracted the attention of @entity42			0
@entity43 : @entity32 's @entity35 ( front row , second from right ) has been described as the ' @entity47 @entity46 ' @entity32 boss @entity48 will be looking for a job at a @entity27 or @entity51 club next season			1
@entity48 , who sir @entity53 rated as the best of his assistant managers at @entity56 , will leave after the finals because the @entity32 @entity58 can no longer afford his £ 2million - a - year wages			0
could @entity60 become @entity33 ’s @entity61 ? in 1982 @entity61 returned to @entity62 after a long ban for an alleged betting scandal and became top scorer with six goals as he led the @entity62 to victory			1
two years ago @entity60 was in exile in the wake of match fixing allegations in @entity72 , but back at @entity73 last season he hit 12 goals			0
@entity33 are unlikely to go all the way in @entity28 but @entity60 could be a @entity77 dark horse , especially if he gets off to a flyer against @entity32			1
danger man : @entity33 's @entity60 will be hoping to open his account against @entity32 @entity81 indulged in his brand of funky dance celebration when he scored for @entity84 against @entity62 but if @entity88 notch against the @entity15 then the @entity87 striker ’s moves will look rather stilted			1
even during training sessions the @entity88 players have been making a habit of collectively breaking out in traditional dance and song known as @entity94			2
@entity97 ’s @entity96 said : ' if we score then everyone will break out into dance and song			2
' forward planning : @entity88 winger @entity96 says his side will sing and dance is they score against the @entity15 today ’s clash against @entity1 is @entity2 ’s 100th at a @entity105 - the most appearances of any nation			1
they have reached the final on seven occasions , the same amount as five - time winners @entity28			0
@entity2 have won the trophy on three occasions			0
the @entity2 vs @entity1 clash is so hard to call			2
but given that @entity117 is one short of @entity120 @entity0 ’s @entity105 record of 15 goals at finals , the 36 - year - old @entity116 deserves a tickle at 5 - 1 to be opening scorer			1
@entity0 is also 5 - 1			0
in some respects the 2 - 1 defeat to @entity62 has not affected @entity84 's perceived requirement to reach the knockout stage			2
before @entity84 played @entity62 , the prevailing wisdom was that a solid opening draw against @entity131 would leave @entity133 ’s men needing a point against @entity135 and a win against @entity137 to make the last 16			0
thanks to @entity137 's shock 3 - 1 win over @entity135 , the form book suggests that @entity84 now need a draw against @entity135 and a win against @entity137 to make the last 16			0
of course @entity137 are no pushovers as they have proved , but often unfancied teams that come out of the blocks flying eventually falter at the final hurdle of the group			0
and on the two occasions that @entity84 have lost their first games ( in 1962 and 1986 ) they went on to reach the quarter - finals			0
upset : @entity84 will probably need to beat @entity154 ( left ) and @entity137 in their final group game after defeat to @entity62 in @entity157 @entity105 memory this tournament has perhaps the strongest collection of @entity162 nations at a @entity105 finals			1
@entity164 once predicted an @entity162 team would win the @entity105 at the turn of the 21st century			1
that breakthrough has yet to come and , despite their strength , @entity167 is tough group for @entity88 to emerge from			0
but the fact they are considered a threat to @entity2 and @entity1 emphasises how much @entity162 football has progressed since @entity176 were the first black @entity162 nation to make a finals			1
making history : @entity176 , pictured here in action against @entity182 during the 1974 @entity105 , were the first @entity162 nation to compete at a finals after losing 4 - 0 to @entity28 and 2 - 0 @entity182 they were trashed 9 - 0 by @entity185			1
the @entity28 game is best remembered for the mad moment when @entity176 defender @entity188 rushed out from the wall and cleared a free - kick before @entity28 had actually taken it			2
combined with that defeat to @entity185 , who needed a big win to progress at the expense of @entity182 , @entity176 did no favours for the image of @entity162 football			1
but @entity197 , @entity33 , @entity198 and @entity88 are all being taken very seriously this summer .			2

@entity10 star @entity0 and his @entity1 team - mates will face @entity2 in their first @entity105 game
@entity35 has been dubbed the ' @entity47 @entity46 '
@entity33 's @entity60 could follow in the *footsteps* of former @entity62 striker @entity61
@entity96 says @entity88 will sing and dance if they score against the @entity15
@entity162 football has developed *hugely* since @entity176 's @entity105 debut in 1974
