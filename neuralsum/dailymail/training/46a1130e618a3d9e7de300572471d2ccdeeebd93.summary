by @entity0 published : 19:59 est , 16 march 2014 updated : 20:46 est , 16 march 2014 a team of women in the beer industry have been manufacturing more subtle flavours to attract female drinkers beer is increasingly replacing wine for women amid successful efforts to introduce brews with sophisticated and subtle flavours			1
the campaign for real ale ( @entity15 ) has some 20,000 female members , while a new generation of women ‘ brewsters ’ are creating successful craft ales			1
in fact , there is evidence dating back to thousands of years before @entity24 was born to show women were the first and most respected of brewers			1
now a group of women at the top of @entity32 ’s burgeoning brewery industry have developed a range of seven beers designed to appeal particularly to women , but also men			2
the @entity38 range consists of ' old world ’ continental beer styles , such as @entity41 and a @entity43 wheat beer , to ‘ new world ’ beer flavours like an @entity45 , a @entity47 common steam beer and a @entity48			1
the beers are being produced by the leading independent brewery @entity50 with the help of the head of its supply chain @entity54 , who is now perhaps the single most influential brewer in the @entity32 , presiding over 60 ales across five breweries			0
@entity59 ’s 28 - year - old brewmaster , @entity58 , worked with @entity54 on the @entity38 range and created one of the beers herself - a @entity63			1
@entity58 said : ‘ i ’d love to see beer become even more popular amongst women			2
‘ more people need to start recognising beer alongside wines with respect to food matching and breadth of flavours and character			0
‘ i am passionate about getting more information and knowledge to the consumer about the magic of the brewing process , the magical flavours of ingredients and the heritage behind some of the country ’s oldest and most classic beers			0
’ traditionally , women have been the target of the wine market , with men the faithful beer drinkers the other women behind the new range all come from @entity92 ’s beer team and include ale buyer @entity93 , world beers buyer @entity95 and beer technical advisor @entity97			1
@entity93 , aged 30 , who is responsible for sourcing a range of nearly 600 ales for the chain , said : ‘ whisper it softly but there is a quiet revolution taking place in the beer world and women are playing a part in it			2
‘ tastes are changing and a new breed of drinker is emerging who is looking for beers with different flavours and strong character in much the same way that we approach wine			0
‘ increasing numbers of women are enjoying beer these days - and in particular lighter , refreshing brews - so it ’s natural that many are now entering the beer industry and are helping influence current trends			2
’ clay tablets suggest that in ancient @entity132 , which is considered the cradle of civilisation , the majority of brewers were probably women			2
this group were given special status in society , supposedly receiving divine protection from female gods			0
@entity141 of @entity15 said : ‘ it is only in modern times that men have overtaken women as the main brewers of beer , as historically it was women who dominated brewing			1
‘ traditionally known as ‘ brewsters ’ , it is fantastic to see more women rejoining the industry and in many cases giving the chaps a run for their money			0
’ one female owned and run brewery making a name for themselves nationally is the award winning @entity163 ’s brewery			0
founded by @entity15 members @entity163 and @entity166 at a small six barrel plant in @entity168 , @entity169 , in 2008 , they moved to a larger 15 barrel site in 2012 to help meet the growing demand			1
@entity163 said : ‘ brewing real ale is a great job , you get to experiment with new hops , rebrew old favourites and hopefully give the people who drink your beer a great pint			0
’ the new range will be sold in @entity182 pubs and @entity92 stores .			0

@entity15 ( @entity15 ) has 20,000 female members and growing
@entity38 range will feature more subtle flavours to attract women
will feature ' old ' brews and ' new world ' ones like @entity45
historically , women were the first and most respected brewers
