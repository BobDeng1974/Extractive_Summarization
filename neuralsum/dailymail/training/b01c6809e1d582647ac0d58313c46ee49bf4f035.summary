host commentator it 's all over in @entity2 and @entity3 have been well worth their point this evening			2
@entity6 smacked the crossbar in the early stages , but that was to be the closest @entity10 would come			1
the home side were dangerous on the counter-attack and caused @entity10 a few problems without ever seriously testing @entity14			1
88mins : @entity14 is on course for his fourth clean sheet in seven games here as the game slowsl into a canter			2
the crowd are still bouncing up and down but it has n't quite been enough to sing their side to victory			0
spurs play the ball around the back before @entity6 loses an aerial battle			2
@entity30 : just clocked a worrying banner amongst the @entity3 supporters that reads : ' only jews and p * * * * * * ' - a play on words on @entity36			2
surely one for @entity37 to look at in the coming days			0
85mins : @entity38 is shown a yellow card after a late challenge on @entity41			0
the substitute was unlucky as he looked to have won the ball but @entity41 's play - acting was enough to convince the referee			2
82mins : @entity6 fires a tame free - kick into the @entity3 wall as @entity10 look to gain an advantage in the closing stages			1
@entity50 are level and it 's thanks to a beautiful free - kick from @entity53			1
@entity54 was left scrambling in his goal as @entity53 lifted the strike up and over the wall			1
73mins : @entity57 blazes over after the ball falls kindly at the edge of the @entity10 box			2
if there 's going to be a winner in @entity3 , it looks likely to be the home side			1
65mins : @entity65 has injected a bit of pace into the @entity10 attack , but @entity3 continue to frustrate the away side			1
@entity70 wins a controversial corner after a tackle from @entity73			2
the returning skipper has put his side ahead with a 25 - yard volley ! unfortunately , it 's not quite as wonderful as it sounds as @entity80 's scuffed strike took a deflection before bobbling in			1
but the @entity83 fans wo n't care ! @entity84 comes on for @entity85 as @entity3 make the first change of the game			1
52mins : @entity3 are starting to put pressure on @entity10 during the early stages of the second half			1
@entity91 looks lively and almost puts his side ahead after brilliant work from @entity94 on the left			0
luckily for @entity10 , his shot was tame and @entity14 could collect easily			1
48mins : @entity97 is shown a yellow card for a late tackle on @entity91 , but the free - kick comes to nothing as @entity14 clears			1
we 're back underway in @entity3 and @entity50 as the two @entity103 clubs look to grab their first three points of the season			1
@entity30 : not many positives for @entity10 after that first - half			2
they lacked ideas going forward			0
@entity97 struggled at left back and @entity110 picked up a needless booking for dissent			2
it can only get better for @entity10 after that			0
the scores are level at half - time as both @entity10 and @entity83 are held by @entity3 and @entity50 respectively			1
@entity10 's best chance came after just three minutes as @entity6 smashed a left - footed shot against the crossbar			1
at the other end , @entity14 has been forced into action on several occasions after quick counter-attacks from the @entity3 frontline			1
42mins : @entity10 are having lots of controlled possession , but they 've been unable to turn that into chances			0
@entity3 look threatening on the counter-attack and @entity10 may be happy to see the half - time break as @entity14 saves a shot from @entity133			1
many eyes will be on @entity135 this evening to see if the debutant can help plug gaps in a @entity10 defence that never quite replaced @entity139			1
so far the combination with @entity141 looks no better or worse than solid , although @entity135 was rather fortunate to see @entity3 have a chance blocked from point blank range after completely mid-judging a headed clearance			1
@entity110 has just been booked for dissent , with @entity146 now feeling the need to come to the touchline to overlook his now struggling side			0
and it 's all square in @entity50 as @entity152 scores for the home side			1
the strike took a huge deflection off @entity83 's @entity156			2
34mins : @entity110 is shown a yellow card for losing his temper with the linesman after a foul on @entity85			0
moments later , @entity110 looks to have led with is elbow as he comes together with @entity85 once again			0
the winger needs to calm down here			0
30mins : the ball bobbles around the @entity3 box before the ball drops kindly to @entity6			2
the young striker lines up a left - footed volley , but can only blaze his effort over the bar			2
at the other end , @entity57 volleys over after an attack along the right leaves @entity10 looking a bit light defensively			0
0 - 0 ! 26mins : concern for @entity10 as @entity3 come close to taking the lead before @entity14 pulls off a point blank save to deny @entity70			1
@entity177 's last trip to @entity178 was n't a pleasant one , and his replacement this evening in @entity97 is not quite enjoying it neither - albeit for different reasons			2
@entity97 has already given the ball away a couple of times , and @entity3 are finding it a little too easy to breach the @entity10 back line by attacking the right flank			1
@entity10 are starting to wobble after a good opening 10 minutes			0
21mins : over in @entity2 , @entity10 have survived one @entity3 scare after a good cross from @entity191 was cleared to safety			2
at the other end , it 's been slim pickings for @entity10 as @entity110 looks lively			0
the @entity196 have the lead thanks to a brilliant left - footed strike from @entity199			2
he found space in the @entity50 penalty area before rifling the ball past the @entity50 goalkeeper			0
10mins : the first 10 minutes are up in in @entity50 and @entity83 are putting a bit of pressure on the home team			1
a commons free - kick results in a @entity83 corner before @entity50 manage to clear			1
good start for the @entity210 7mins : @entity110 bombs down the right before finding @entity213 who gives the ball away			0
the crowd are getting right behind their team as the game settles down inside the first 10 minutes			0
3min : @entity10 have their first chance of the game and it 's @entity6 with a strike against the crossbar			1
he worked the ball well onto his left foot inside the penalty area before thundering a striker onto the upright			0
that certainly would have silenced the crowd early on ... and we 're underway in @entity178 and @entity10 take kick - off			1
the @entity3 fans are already creating quite an atmosphere despite the running track between themselves and the pitch			0
there 's just 150 travelling fans here in @entity2 today , perhaps the potential for supporter clashes has something to do with the lack of numbers			0
one @entity3 supporter has just whipped out a @entity244 flag ! it 's a big issue where ever you go			0
the teams are out as we prepare to get this evening 's 6pm kick - offs underway			0
@entity10 ( all in yellow ) step out onto the @entity3 pitch as the local fans send a few jeers their way			2
speaking to @entity254 ahead of kick - off , @entity146 says : ' we have a strong sqaud and i said on the first day that we believe in all of our players			0
for different reasons some players are in @entity261			0
' it 's important for the team and this is my first game in the @entity265			0
we expect a good performance			0
getting three points is the most important thing			0
' a look back at 1991 from a football perspective conjures up memories which give a stern reminder of just how much football really has moved on			0
( sir ) @entity274 still had n’t won a league title with @entity276 , the class of ’ 92 were still yet to rip through the youth level of the game and the @entity280 did n’t exist			0
in addition , an @entity282 manager was about to win the top flight title with a now second tier club and even the @entity287 team were actually rather good			0

only @entity14 features from @entity10 ' 2 - 2 draw at @entity304 with defender @entity135 making his debut , and @entity306 in the team for his first start			1
it 's a gloriously warm and sunny evening in @entity2 and the pa system in the ground is doing its best to kick the home fans into a frenzy			0
heavy rock music is playing around the ground - but with the capacity yet half full , it 's not really having the desired effect			0
