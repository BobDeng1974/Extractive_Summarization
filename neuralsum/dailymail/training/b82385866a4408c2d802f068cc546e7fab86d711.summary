@entity1 - based suppliers @entity0 have found demand is high for the new tanks the accessory has a special system providing a circular current to allow the creatures to constantly float as they would in the sea as well as making interesting pets , the moon jellyfish also create a ' living lava lamp ' effect to jazz up home interiors by @entity15 jellyfish are becoming an unlikely new favourite pet in @entity19 homes after specialist fish tanks launched to house them have proved a sell out			1
@entity21 reported last month how a @entity23 firm could ship the high - tech tanks to the @entity19 - but now a supplier in @entity26 , @entity1 , have made it easier for @entity19 buyers to adopt the unusual creatures with the new @entity30			2
@entity0 are distributing the novel tanks - which can house up to 12 non-stinging moon jellyfish - across the @entity19			1
and managing director @entity33 said demand has been so high they have already sold out and are struggling to keep up with demand			0
he said : ' previously people could n't keep them because the aquariums were n't available , and they ca n't be kept in normal fish tanks because jellyfish require a current to swim			2
water flow : the £ 775 accessory has a special system that provides a circular current to allow the creatures to constantly float as they would in the sea unusual pets : up to 12 moon jellyfish , which do n't have stings , can be housed in the tanks and the water flow means they wo n't sink to the bottom or get stuck to the sides ' if there is no current , the jellyfish would stick in the corners of the tank or settle on the bottom			1
' the systems that were available before were one - offs for big aquariums			0
this meant it cost tens of thousands of pounds for an organisation to have one made , but now we are manufacturing 50 to 100 at a time , it has brought the cost down massively			0
' however the tanks still do n't come cheap as they cost £ 775 from aquarium shops while the moon jellyfish have to be purchased separately from special stockists at prices between £ 29.99 - £ 39.99			2
' better than a sculpture ' : the creatures make an interesting addition to living or office space in demand : @entity100 have sold out of the tanks as people clamour to get them in their homes care : the jellyfish need to be fed once every one to two days with special food as well as making interesting pets , jellyfish are being marketed as away to add decor to the home or office as the tank is illuminated by multicolour led lights - giving the impression of ' a living lava lamp '			1
the company 's website states that the ' illuminated aquatic artwork ' of the jellyfish aquarium beats any expensive sculptures and paintings			0
mr @entity33 added : ' there are led lights down the centre of the tank which can be set to different colours or go through the whole spectrum and light up the jellyfish like a living lava lamp			1
' the look of the tank is very modern and works as a display and can appeal to a lot of people because it looks great and because it 's low maintenance			0
' the jellyfish need to be fed once every one to two days with special food which can be placed through a section at the top of the tank .			0
