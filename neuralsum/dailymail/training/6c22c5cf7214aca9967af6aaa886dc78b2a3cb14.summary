when humans first left @entity2 some 60,000 years ago , they went on to leave their genetic footprints around the world			1
these same footprints have revealed that some humans decided to return to @entity2 , carrying genes from the rest of the world back to the continent			2
now a new study of southern @entity13 genes reveals that a previously unknown migration took western @entity16 dna back to continent 3,000 years ago			1
researchers found signs of @entity16 genes in individuals belonging to a range of @entity24 tribes ( pictured ) writing in the @entity26 , @entity25 reports on a study that looked at the dna of @entity24 tribes of southern @entity2			1
the @entity24 tribes are thought to have lived in near - isolation from the rest of humanity for thousands of years			2
the study by @entity34 revealed that that some of their genes closely match people from modern - day southern @entity39 , including @entity40 and @entity41			1
dating methods suggest the @entity39 dna made their way into the @entity24 dna sometime between 900 and 1800 years ago , before known @entity39 contact with the region the recent research confirms a 2012 study by @entity49 of the @entity50 which found @entity52 genes in people living in @entity54			1
they found that the genomes of some @entity54 populations bear striking similarities to those of populations in @entity61 and @entity62 , a potential genetic legacy of the @entity64 and her companions			0
the team detected mixing between some @entity54 and @entity52 populations dating to approximately 3,000 years ago			2
researchers have now identified two migrations : one about 3,000 years ago , of non-africans entering east @entity2 , and a second one 900 – 1,800 years ago			1
‘ these are very special , isolated populations , carrying what are probably the most ancient lineages in human populations today , ’ @entity71 of @entity34 told @entity26			0
dating methods suggest the @entity39 dna made their way into the @entity24 dna sometime between 900 and 1800 years ago , before known @entity39 contact with the region			1
meanwhile , archaeological studies of the region suggest that a subset of the @entity24 , known as the @entity85 speakers , arrived in southern @entity2 from east @entity2 much earlier			1
professor @entity71 found that the proportion of @entity16 dna was highest in @entity88 tribes , who have up to 14 per cent of western @entity16 ancestry			0
‘ these populations were always thought to be pristine hunter - gatherers who had not interacted with anyone for millennia , ’ added professor @entity71 's collaborator , linguist @entity91			0
‘ well , no. just like the rest of the world , @entity2 had population movements too			0
there was simply no writing , no @entity102 or @entity103 to document it			0
’ it is uncertain why humans first left @entity2 , but researchers believe it has something to do with major climatic shifts that were happening around that time			0
the recent research confirms a 2012 study by @entity49 of the @entity50 which found @entity52 genes in people living in @entity54			0
they found that the genomes of some @entity54 populations bear striking similarities to those of populations in @entity61 and @entity62 , a potential genetic legacy of the @entity64 and her companions			0
the team detected mixing between some @entity54 and @entity52 populations dating to approximately 3,000 years ago			2
the @entity24 tribes , found in southern @entity2 , lived in near - isolation from the rest of humanity for thousands of years			1
the distribution of the three language families spoken by @entity24 people is shown on this map in green			0

researchers analysed dna of isolated @entity24 tribes in southern @entity2
some genes closely match people from modern - day southern @entity39
*scientists* claim @entity39 dna made its way into the @entity24 dna 900 to 1800 years ago , before known @entity39 contact with region
further evidence suggests a subset of @entity24 , known as the @entity85 speakers , arrived in southern @entity2 from @entity2 *2,200* years ago
