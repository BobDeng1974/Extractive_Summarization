by @entity0 published : 12:05 est , 1 january 2013 updated : 12:30 est , 1 january 2013 this is moment a daredevil ' car jumper ' flew through the air over a line of nine vehicles - in a beaten - up old banger			1
brave driver @entity7 revved up the rusty engine and soared high above the @entity10 track in an extraordinary display of determination and skill			1
the jaw - dropping stunt earned the 31 - year - old mechanic the title of 2012 's car jumping champion			2
' you just head for the ramp and hope for the best , ' said mr @entity7 , from @entity42			0
' hope you land on the other side			0
' race organiser @entity44 agreed that winning the terrifying championship at @entity47 was largely about having the grit - or the craziness - to do it			1
' the drivers get in their car , aim at a ramp and then next thing they see is the sky - and they hope they 're going to clear ten cars , ' he said			1
' it 's just a thrill - and you get the lunatics that ca n't go on the road , that want to race , and just do something really special			1
' you 've got to be an idiot , to start with , or have no fear , and then it 's just luck , because it depends on the pitch of the car , how long you hold the throttle ... thrill ride : an ancient car spray - painted in red and blue zooms over a line of motors that look like they have tried the same in the past engines running : the drivers say they love the buzz of the terrifying competition , held at @entity47 in @entity10 perfect take - off : cars with rear - wheel drive are more effective because they can keep up their speed even after the front wheels have left the ramp leap of faith : the pink motor does n't look likely to go the distance nosedive ! and indeed , the colourful car comes down to earth with a bump crunch time : the vehicle ends up upside down , its driver hanging from a seatbelt - but they 'll have found it fun ' there is a technique , but only the top few drivers know it - the rest have just gone out there to be stuntmen			1
' the wacky cars are painted in vibrant colours such as pink and acid green to match the drivers ' flair and remarkable nerve			2
others add patterns such as @entity116 or write slogans on the peeling bodywork of the clapped - out cars			2
rear - wheel drive cars are more effective than front - wheel drive , because the back wheels can turn even after the car is halfway off the ramp			2
a front - wheel drive car will nosedive			0
last year 's champion , @entity126 , said : ' it 's just a little bit of a buzz			0
' everyone gets a bit nervous at first , but as soon as you 're lined up , accelerators flat down to the floor , into second gear hopefully get enough speed and hope it goes all right			0
it 's a bit of fun '			0
