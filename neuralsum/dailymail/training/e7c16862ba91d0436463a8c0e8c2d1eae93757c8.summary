it was the alchemical quest that was midwife to the birth of modern science : how to transform common elements into precious gold			1
now researchers have found a bacterium that could fit the bill as a modern day philosophers ' stone , by turning a toxic chemical compound found in nature into solid , 24 - carat gold			1
a team from @entity15 discovered that the metal - tolerant bacteria cupriavidus metallidurans can grow on massive concentrations of gold chloride , which is deadly to other creatures			1
they found that the tiny bugs can transform the toxic substance to produce gold nuggets			0
he and @entity41 , associate professor of electronic art and intermedia , found that @entity44 can grow on massive concentrations of gold chloride – a toxic chemical compound found in nature that is often known as liquid gold			1
in fact , the professors discovered , the bacteria are at least 25 times stronger than previously reported among scientists			1
the pair made their findings with a novel art installation dubbed @entity56 of the @entity57 , which uses a combination of biotechnology , art and alchemy to turn liquid gold into 24 - carat gold			1
the artwork contains a portable laboratory made of 24 - carat gold - plated hardware , a glass bioreactor containing the bacteria , a combination that produces gold in front of an audience			1
bubbling away : the researchers found the metal - tolerant bacteria cupriavidus metallidurans can grow on massive concentrations of gold chloride , which is deadly to other creatures , and turn it to pure 24 - carat gold valuable : pure gold flecks produced by the art - science experiment professors @entity41 and @entity38 fed the bacteria unprecedented amounts of gold chloride , mimicking the process they believe happens in nature			1
in about a week , the bacteria metabolised the toxins and produced a gold nugget			0
the @entity56 of the @entity57 uses a living system as a vehicle for artistic exploration , professor @entity41 said			0
the artwork also includes a series of images made with a scanning electron microscope			0
using ancient gold illumination techniques , professor @entity41 applied 24 - carat gold leaf to regions of the prints where a bacterial gold deposit was identified so each print contains some of the gold produced in the bioreactor			1
every part , every detail of the project is a cross between modern microbiology and alchemy , ' he said			0
' science tries to explain the phenomenological world			2
as an artist , i ’m trying to create a phenomenon			0
art has the ability to push scientific inquiry			2
' ' neo-alchemy ' : this print of a scanning electron microscope image made as part of the experiment has been illuminated with gold leaf made in the bioreactor the philosopher 's stone is a legendary alchemical substance said to be capable of turning base metals like lead into gold			2
it was also sometimes believed to be an elixir of life , useful for rejuvenation and possibly for achieving immortality			0
for many centuries , it was the most sought - after goal in @entity143 alchemy			2
the philosopher 's stone was the central symbol of the mystical terminology of alchemy , symbolizing perfection at its finest , enlightenment , and heavenly bliss			0
efforts to discover the philosopher 's stone were known as the @entity56			0
many early scientists were obsessed with the discovering the secret			0
it would be cost prohibitive to reproduce their experiment on a larger scale , he said			0
but the researchers ’ success in creating gold raises questions about greed , economy and environmental impact , focusing on the ethics related to science and the engineering of nature			2
the @entity171 was selected for exhibition and received an honorable mention at the world - renowned cyber art competition , @entity176 , in @entity177 , where it ’s on display until october 7			1
@entity176 is one of the most important awards for creativity and pioneering spirit in the field of digital and hybrid media			0
' art has the ability to probe and question the impact of science in the world , and the @entity56 of the @entity57 speaks directly to the scientific preoccupation while trying to shape and bend biology to our will within the postbiological age , ' professor @entity41 said .			1

professors describe their work as ' neo-alchemy ' and exhibit findings in the form of art - science installation now on display in @entity177
