stress and indignity : life on a mixed sex ward in an @entity7 hospital			1
hospitals are fined £ 250 a day if they do not stick to the rules hospitals are docked £ 250 per patient per day if they place people with members of the opposite sex without clinical justification			1
of the 167 acute trusts that submitted data for october , 114 made no breaches of the rules			1
hospitals in two strategic health authorities – @entity35 and @entity36 – accounted for almost two thirds of breaches across the country			2
one trust – @entity41 – accounted for 169 breaches due to a short - term problem			2
a statement from the trust said there were a few days in october when there was a ‘ sudden surge in severely ill patients ’ needing admission to the hospital			0
‘ this led to one of our day units being used to admit inpatients requiring an operation , ’ it said			0
‘ the trust is committed to minimising cancelled operations and , for this short period of time , exceptional measures were introduced to ensure patients requiring an operation could be admitted			0
‘ whilst from a quality perspective , patients were cared for well , some patients had to change behind closed curtains into theatre gowns in order to go to theatre			0
‘ this breached @entity0 guidelines of same - sex accommodation			1
’ single - sex accommodation means patients of the same sex sharing sleeping , bathroom and toilet facilities , either in single rooms or single - sex wards single - sex accommodation means patients of the same sex sharing sleeping , bathroom and toilet facilities , either in single rooms or single - sex wards			0
if men and women share a ward , then they must have separate bays or rooms			0
intensive care and @entity93 are exempt from the policy			0
almost 12,000 hospital patients stayed in mixed - sex accommodation last december , when monthly collection of data was first introduced			1
since then the number of reported breaches – when a patient stayed overnight in shared accommodation – has fallen by 90 per cent			0
@entity103 , chief executive of the @entity104 , said ‘ treating patients in mixed - sex accommodation compromises their dignity and causes additional stress at what is already a difficult and anxious time			1
for years , governments have said that clamping down on this is a priority , yet still it continues to happen			0
‘ now the @entity0 ’s figures show a marked increase in the number of people staying in mixed - sex accommodation			1
‘ it is clear that cuts are beginning to bite and hospitals are struggling to ensure that the care they provide is up to an acceptable standard			0
‘ it is not enough to spout rhetoric about mixed - sex accommodation being unacceptable , the @entity0 needs to provide practical support to the trusts who continue to breach mixed - sex accommodation guidelines to stamp out this problem once and for all			1
’ health minister @entity134 said ‘ the @entity7 has made significant improvement in tackling mixed - sex accommodation – down almost 90 per cent in under a year , thanks to improved transparency			2
‘ but despite this overall improvement , nobody should have to suffer the indignity of mixed - sex accommodation			2
‘ every unjustified breach is one too many			0
