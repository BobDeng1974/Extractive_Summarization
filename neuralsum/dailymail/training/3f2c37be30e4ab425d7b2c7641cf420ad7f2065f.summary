the @entity8 , gangster ’s 1928 @entity6 was fitted with 3,000lb of steel armour and painted green with black fenders to mimic a police car , with flashing lights , a siren and police - band radio receiver			1
the bulletproof windows could be raised to reveal holes through which machine guns could be fired , while the rear window could be dropped to let his henchman fire on those chasing them			1
untouchable : a cadillac which was kitted out with steel armour and bulletproof windows to protect its owner - legendary @entity27 gangster @entity3 - is going on sale @entity3 was eventually jailed for tax evasion , and ironically his 84 - year - old car is classed as a classic and is therefore tax exempt			1
latterly owned by a @entity8 car collector , it will be sold at @entity35 in @entity36 on august 20			2
the car even had a flashing light , siren and the first police - band radio receiver in private hands			2
to further protect its precious load the bulletproof glass windows could be wound further than normal to reveal circular holes through which machine guns could be fired			1
and in case this was not enough to deter any drivers taking up the chase , the rear window of the ride was rigged to drop at an instant so @entity3 ’s henchmen could open fire at any following cars			2
the car , which is thought to have been briefly used by president @entity58 after @entity3 was imprisoned for tax evasion , is expected to fetch a six figure sum at auction			0
decked out : @entity3 would have been safe in this one , the 1928 @entity6 has 3,000lbs of steel armour fitted and was used by president @entity58 after @entity3 's imprisonment machine gun friendly : the bullet proof glass had muzzle sized holes for @entity3 and his fellow gangsters to fit their guns and even a drop down rear window , pictured , to mow down pursuers considering his crime – the one he was imprisoned for – @entity3 would probably have been pleased to know that his old car , being 84 - years - old , is classed as a classic and is therefore tax exempt			1
after @entity3 ’s imprisonment the vehicle went on to be shown around the world , even making a trip to the @entity82 in the 1950 ’s displayed at the @entity84 amusement park and at the @entity86 funfair			0
it later entered the collection of the @entity8 motor enthusiast @entity89 who died last year in a car crash and it is now being sold as part of his estate			0
the car is going on sale at the end of august and is expected to fetch £ 325,000 at the auction in their research into the origins of the car , auctioneers uncovered 92 - year - old @entity104 , whose mechanic father fitted the armour			2
he said @entity3 's mobsters arrived and told him what they wanted doing			2
mr @entity104 said : ‘ my dad said “ we do n't do that kind of work here , ” and they said “ you do now			0
” ’ the car was then backed into the garage so no one could see what was happening to it			0
mr @entity104 said @entity3 turned up to pay the bill himself and even gave the ten - year - old mr @entity104 a ten dollar note - a small fortune to a young boy at the time			0
a spokesman for @entity35 said : ‘ this is widely considered as one of the most historically significant pre-war @entity8 cars			0
‘ it is liveried in green with black fenders to mirror the @entity131 supplied to the @entity27 police and city officials at the time			1
‘ it is one of the earliest surviving " bulletproof " cars and was fitted new with heavy glass measuring nearly an inch thick and completely lined with 3,000lbs of steel armour plating			1
‘ ‘ it has undergone restoration and is a fabulous piece of history			0
’ @entity145 was born to @entity147 immigrants in @entity148 , @entity149 in 1899			0
after being kicked out of school aged 14 he became involved in local teenage gangs and but moved to @entity27 in his early twenties to take advantage of the thriving market for illegal alcohol during the first years of @entity157			1
@entity3 , imprisoned for tax evasion , would probably have a laugh at his old ride being tax exempt there he ran prostitution rings , illegal gambling halls but made most of his money running speakeasy bars where thirsty @entity27 dwellers could get their hands on banned alcohol			1
he rose to become the leader of ' the @entity174 ' gang , which later became known as ' the @entity175 ' and ruled the streets of @entity27 from the early 1920 's until his capture in 1931			1
despite his gangster ways @entity3 was a highly visible public figure in @entity27 and even opened charity soup kitchens and worked for the safety of the city 's children @entity3 has been credited with ordering one of the most famous mass murders in 20th century @entity8 - the @entity187 - where members of his gang gunned down seven of the rival @entity192 gang whilst dressed in police uniforms			1
the law finally caught up with the mob leader in 1931 when he was sentenced to 11 years in prison for tax evasion			2
he spent a majority of his sentence in the famous @entity201 prison where he was famous for manipulating prison guards			0
his health deteriorated in prison and he was no longer capable to run ' the @entity174 ' upon his release			0
suffering from neurosyphilis his mental health broke down and when examined a few years after his release he was said to have the mental capacity of a 12 - year - old			0
