by @entity0 according to a report in @entity3 , @entity1 want a refund on new signing @entity5 , because he does n't speak any @entity7			1
it was satire , of course			0
with their current problems at the back , @entity1 are over the moon to finally have @entity5 among their ranks			2
but the joke captures the feeling in @entity16 that @entity1 are becoming increasingly hispanic			0
this has been a @entity19 summer for @entity1 in the transfer market			1
@entity21 has been drafted in as a reserve goalkeeper , @entity23 was signed from @entity24 , and @entity25 has completed a move to the @entity28 champions			1
on top of that , @entity1 have also shown interest in @entity33 's @entity32			2
part of the reason for @entity1 's interest in the aforementioned players are the injuries to @entity51 and @entity52			1
@entity52 , of course , was signed by former coach @entity54 , himself a connoisseur of @entity19 football			2
the rest , most notably @entity51 , are products of the @entity34 era			0
an era which many are now concerned is too @entity19 influenced			0
@entity1 legend @entity62 claimed last may that @entity34 ' does n't understand the @entity28 football mentality ' , while a @entity19 journalist recently wrote in the @entity66 tabloid @entity65 that the club are ' in danger of losing their identity '			1
even @entity23 , one of @entity1 's new @entity19 , warned that ' a @entity19 faction in the squad would be dangerous '			1
the criticism is a little unfair			0
@entity34 may have signed a host of @entity19 players , and even brought two former @entity76 colleagues into his coaching staff , but the vast majority of his entourage remains @entity28			1
he has also continued to build around key @entity28 players such as @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83			0
in face of a defensive catastrophe , he has put his faith in @entity87 , a homegrown player who has just returned from nearly two years of injury			0
feeling the pressure ? @entity34 ( left ) gets aggressive towards @entity82 ( second right ) in training shove off : @entity1 's boss was filmed pushing the @entity28 forward earlier this week as for @entity1 's identity , @entity34 is arguably just continuing a tradition which @entity1 have upheld since rising to dominance in the 70s			1
reinforcement in @entity66 always arrives through a mixture of financial muscle and a strong youth system			0
@entity34 's @entity19 - focused activity in the transfer market must be seen in the context of his close work with the @entity1 youth system			1
that work has borne fruit in recent months with the emergence into the first team of youngsters @entity112 and @entity113			0
when it comes to the transfer market , though , there is no denying @entity34 's penchant for @entity39 above all else			2
the departure of @entity28 @entity119 hero @entity42 is a classic example			0
though @entity34 did not want to lose the player , his solution to the problem came in the form of a @entity125 , @entity23			2
the signing from @entity24 will now play at left back , with the versatile @entity128 @entity127 being redeployed in midfield to fill the gap left by @entity42			2
even aside from personnel , though , there are worries that @entity34 's approach is still too @entity19			1
honorary president @entity135 voiced concerns last spring that @entity34 's tactical philosophy did n't suit @entity1			1
cheers : @entity34 is showered in beer by @entity140 after winning the @entity142 last season critic : @entity135 is not a fan of tiki - taka ' they play like @entity76 , where even standing on the goal - line they play the ball backwards ' @entity135 moaned on @entity150			1
the comment provoked an indignant defence from @entity34 at the time , but details have since emerged that he is responsive to that criticism , and is keen to show @entity1 are not simply a remodelled @entity76			2
in pre-release extracts from a new biography , @entity34 is quoted saying ' i hate tiki - taka '			1
' @entity159 is when you play the ball only in order to play it again			0
this does n't interest us			0
what we need is the central midfielders and the defence to be aggressive going forward and to break the opposing ranks			0
we need to keep the ball on one side , so as to free space to attack on the other			0
not this pointless tiki - taka			1
' the ' pointless ' version of tiki - taka is often what @entity1 were caught playing last season			1
with @entity179 now added to their ranks , @entity34 will hope that his attack has more of a cutting edge this season			0
@entity34 is walking a tightrope , and adapting himself to a new football culture			0
he speaks passable @entity28 already , but the next stage is much more difficult			0
the next stage is to ensure his style can be as @entity28 as it is @entity19 ; a style of tiki - taka focused on the goal , or to use the @entity28 word , the @entity192			1
it is , as @entity194 put it on thursday , a case of @entity197 - @entity192 @entity1 not expecting to stroll past slumping @entity198			2

@entity1 have signed @entity25 from @entity43
@entity34 has been criticised for making @entity1 ' too @entity19 '
@entity1 sold @entity3 star @entity42 to @entity43 earlier this summer
@entity34 has also signed @entity23 from @entity24 and @entity21
@entity135 among those to have *bemoaned* @entity1 's @entity19 style
@entity34 *insists* tiki - taka is ' pointless '
