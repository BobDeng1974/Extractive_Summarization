by @entity0 published : 15:03 est , 6 june 2013 updated : 01:42 est , 7 june 2013 as the wife of a proud @entity7 , her attempt at a @entity5 burr should be pitch perfect			0
but @entity9 , who is married to actor @entity10 , makes a mealy - mouthed attempt in her latest advert for a leading whisky			1
she plays a temptress in the @entity16 ’s whisky promotion , which have drawn criticism because of the 40 - year - old @entity20 - @entity19 ’s cringe - inducing accent			0
the agency behind the ad has defended @entity9 the latest advert , for @entity16 ’s @entity43 blend , shows @entity9 standing at the window of a brick - facade apartment , looking seductively into the camera and purring : ' you should be asking yourself - what is sweetness without a little bite ? ' oddly , the actress is then stung by a bee that lands on her finger			0
she uses her stung finger to stir her glass of whisky , and tastes the blend			0
she then looks behind her into the apartment and says to a character off camera : ' be careful @entity34			0
' @entity63 : @entity9 has had success in the past starring opposite @entity65 in the 1998 film meet @entity67 @entity26 's favourite export : @entity10 , 47 from @entity69 and has come close to bagging the role of @entity71 and @entity72 the advert is @entity16 ’s third featuring @entity9 , the first being released in october 2012 and a second in december 2012			1
the campaign , which is only aired in @entity36 , has @entity9 referring to a mystery man named @entity34 at the end of each commercial			1
the first two @entity16 ’s ads drew criticism for @entity9 ’s ropey @entity26 accent and the script , which talks confusingly about the benefits of being serious and going too fast			2
the @entity36 ad agency @entity84 , which created the campaign , explains that @entity9 entices drinkers as ' @entity16 ’s siren ' with the ' presence of a queen and the mouth of a gangster '			1
lost in translation : @entity10 had an overly - formal @entity94 accent when he appeared on @entity36 show @entity95 criticism : viewers expected @entity9 's accent to be better considering she had been married to a @entity99 for six years they said : ' she has a strong , commanding grip over the edgy , underground world and exudes her power through her piercing attitude , cutting tongue and entrancing beauty			1
' she draws the viewer in from the moment she is seen , enticing men and pulling them into her clandestine world			0
' viewers from both sides of the @entity112 took to online forums to berate the original commercial			2
one annoyed @entity36 commented : ' @entity26 accents have been butchered in countless @entity36 shows and movies , but i tend to think of those as @entity36 attempts to fake a @entity26 accent			1
' this is a @entity26 distillery using a @entity122 to “ sound ” @entity26 to the @entity36 audience			1
' another poster said : ' i ’m @entity26 and that ’s painful - she really overdoes rolling the @entity127 and her pronunciation of ‘ benefits ’ is very weird			2
' but this ad would n’t go out in @entity26 as is , since whisky is never sold as “ @entity132 ” in @entity26			2
' i really do n’t understand the last bit - i ca n’t make out what she says , not least because it ’s in a faux @entity138 accent			0
' whether it ’s actually meant to sound like a @entity26 accent , or it ’s meant to sound like a @entity26 person doing a bad @entity138 accent , i have no idea			0
