criticism : sir @entity1 believes pupils are being let down by headteachers who treat sport as an ' optional extra ' a ‘ disproportionately high number ’ of athletes and sports stars are privately educated amid the dire state of competitive sport in state schools , according to the head of @entity9			1
sir @entity1 , chief inspector of schools , will today warn that too many pupils are being let down by head teachers who ‘ treat competitive sport with suspicion or as an optional extra ’			1
not enough state schools are ‘ developing the talents of the next generation of @entity19 ’ and this lack of sporting participation is ‘ cementing the social inequality that holds our nation back ’			1
children are being hampered by teachers unwilling to run teams , sports taught at a ‘ superficial level ’ and ‘ limited facilities ’ such as a lack of playing fields and all - weather playing surfaces			2
sir @entity1 will call on the government to do more to enable competitive sport to thrive in the state sector			1
@entity9 launched an in - depth assessment of competitive school sport after it emerged that 41 per cent of @entity42 medallists at @entity43 were privately educated			0
the watchdog investigated the school backgrounds of @entity47 athletes who compete at @entity49 and @entity50 standard and also at the highest levels in football , rugby union , hockey , netball and cricket			0
it found ‘ unacceptable discrepancies ’ between the proportion of pupils attending state schools and how well they were represented in elite sport			1
despite state schools educating up to 93 per cent of the population , they only produce about a third of top sportspeople across a range of disciplines , the new analysis found			1
forty - five per cent of hockey players , 54 per cent of the rowing team and 73 per cent of the equestrian team competing at the @entity43 were privately educated			0
in the @entity76 @entity75 , 61 per cent of players have attended an independent school			0
cricket and hockey also have an ‘ over-representation ’ of independent - schooled players in their national leagues while football is the ‘ most demographically representative ’ sport			0
ninety - four per cent of @entity47 footballers competing in the @entity87 have been educated at state schools			2
sir @entity1 will tell the @entity90 conference at @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , today : ‘ it simply ca n’t be right that state educated athletes are so woefully under - represented in our elite sports			1
‘ heads who treat competitive sport with suspicion or as an optional extra are not only denying youngsters the clear dividends that come with encouraging them to compete , they are also cementing the social inequality that holds our nation back			1
’ future : not enough state schools are ' developing the talents of the next generation of @entity19 ' and this lack of sporting participation is ¿ cementing the social inequality that holds our nation back ' @entity9 also visited 35 state schools and academies and 10 independent schools			1
it surveyed the views of more than 500 head teachers and 1,000 11 to 18 - year - olds			0
as a result , the watchdog concluded that competitive sport ‘ remains optional in the vast majority of state schools ’			1
only half of the young people surveyed reported that they ‘ regularly ’ played sport in school against their peers or versus other schools			2
just 40 per cent said they regularly played sport outside of school			0
among the head teachers surveyed , only 13 per cent said they expected all students to take part in competitive sport			0
a few indicated that no pupils were expected to participate			0
... only half of the young people surveyed reported that they ‘ regularly ’ played sport in school against their peers or versus other schools			2
just 40 per cent said they regularly played sport outside of school @entity9 ’s report , going the @entity145 , said that the quality of competitive sport in state schools was ‘ very mixed ’			1
in many schools it ‘ was average at best and in a significant number it was weak ’			0
only 15 out of 35 state schools played high quality competitive sport regularly and were successful in regional and national schools ’ competitions			1
the best schools ’ competitive sport was flourishing because it was valued and seen as a key part of the culture and ethos			2
teachers gave up their time to help organise activities and run teams			0
the report says : ‘ in too many of the other maintained schools and academies we visited , students had few opportunities to excel in competitive sport because it was not seen as a priority			2
‘ it was undervalued by school leaders , who were not investing in it			0
‘ they did not have enough teachers willing to organise activities and run teams and were unable to provide enough time to coach or play high quality sport			0
‘ without the ‘ enthusiasts ’ and ‘ organisers ’ – the people on the ground to run school sport – these schools struggled to help students compete regularly or excel			2
’ these schools were less likely to be rated good or outstanding and typically had lower levels of academic achievement than those state schools that offered high quality competitive sport			1
staff focused time on getting pupils involved in @entity197 instead of high quality competitive sport			0
standards of performance were ‘ often low ’ , with independent schools dominating some sports because they ‘ play to a higher standard			0
’ sir @entity1 will insist today that ‘ high school fees and large playing fields are not a pre-requisite to success ’			1
he said : ‘ if all schools follow the example of the best identified in this report , there is no reason why more pupils from state funded schools ca n’t be batting for @entity47 at the @entity218 or scoring a winning try in the next @entity220			2

sir @entity1 believes sport is being treated as an ' optional extra '
not enough state schools are creating ' next generations of @entity226 '
lack of sporting participating is ' cementing social inequality '
