by @entity0 published : 03:25 est , 8 august 2013 updated : 03:40 est , 8 august 2013 men are often heard complaining that women spend far too much on shoes , but now they have succumbed to the temptation themselves			1
they have become so fashion - conscious that they are spending even more money on shoes than women			2
younger men in particular are investing in must - have shoes , ahead of women by 15 per cent in the 16 - to - 24 year - old age group			1
@entity13 : men have overtaken women on shoe - spending , investing in a few expensive pairs every year and digging deep in their pockets for their favourite brands fashion inspiration : despite complaints about women like @entity25 from @entity26 spending huge amounts on must - have shoes , men can no longer resist joining in themselves all age groups of younger men have overtaken women in the spending stakes , according to market researchers @entity33			1
however , men over 45 still show little interest in digging deep in their pockets for fashionable shoes , making do with old pairs they already own			2
when it comes to quantity over quality though , women are still leading the way			0
they buy four more pairs a year on average but they will be cheaper pumps and flats , while men invest in a few choice pairs of high - quality work shoes and designer trainers			1
leading the way for number of shoes bought every year are women in the north - west of @entity56			2
across @entity58 we now spend £ 8.7billion on footwear a year , up 5 per cent on last year			1
men in the north - west and in @entity61 are the most concerned with buying their favourite brands , willing to spend even more for a pair of shoes they covet			0
labels such as @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 have done particulary well out of discerning male customers this year			0
they have become important as a way of updating outfits as consumers are going for eye - catching footwear to give their clothes a fashionable edge			0
a thing of the past ? : men making do with battered old shoes is becoming a distant memory as under 45s are increasingly fashion - conscious for women , styles such as studs , spikes and and tassels have proved particularly popular			2
it is not just shoes that men are coming round to either , the whole shopping experience is appealing to male customers more than ever			0
clothes shopping has become a more common male activity , up five per cent on last year			0
however , it is not all luxurious spending in these difficult financial times			0
spending on repairs have risen 31 per cent as men and women take more trips to the cobblers to make those treasured shoes last as long as possible .			1

men under 45 are now *outspending* women on must - have shoes
@entity58 now spends £ 8.7bn on footwear annually , up 5 per cent on last year
trips to cobblers also up 31 per cent as we hang on to our favourites
