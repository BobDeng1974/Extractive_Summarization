by @entity0 published : 20:45 est , 7 september 2013 updated : 20:46 est , 7 september 2013 @entity2 's newest robotic explorer rocketed into space late friday in an unprecedented moonshot from @entity5 that dazzled sky watchers along the @entity7			1
but the @entity9 spacecraft quickly ran into equipment trouble , and while @entity2 assured everyone early saturday that the lunar probe was safe and on a perfect track for the moon , officials acknowledged the problem needs to be resolved in the next two to three weeks			1
@entity18 @entity17 , director of @entity2 's @entity19 in @entity20 , which developed the spacecraft , told reporters he 's confident everything will be working properly in the next few days			2
@entity9 's reaction wheels were turned on to orient and stabilize the spacecraft , which was spinning too fast after it separated from the final rocket stage , @entity17 said			2
but the computer automatically shut the wheels down , apparently because of excess current			2
he speculated the wheels may have been running a little fast			2
" the @entity9 spacecraft , which is charged with studying the lunar atmosphere and dust , soared aboard an unmanned minotaur rocket a little before midnight from @entity5 's @entity56			1
" godspeed on your journey to the moon , @entity9 , " @entity57 said			1
flight controllers applauded and exchanged high - fives following the successful launch			0
" we are headed to the moon ! " @entity2 said in a tweet			1
it was a change of venue for @entity2 , which normally launches moon missions from @entity69 , @entity70 but it provided a rare light show along the @entity7 for those blessed with clear skies			1
@entity2 urged sky watchers to share their launch pictures through the website @entity76 , and the photos and sighting reports quickly poured in from @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , eastern @entity85 and @entity5 , among other places			1
the @entity9 or @entity9 , pronounced " @entity92 ' - dee , " is taking a roundabout path to the moon , making three huge laps around @entity90 before getting close enough to pop into lunar orbit			1
unlike the quick three - day @entity94 flights to the moon , @entity9 will need a full month to reach @entity90 's closest neighbor			1
an @entity98 rocket , built by @entity99 , provided the ride from @entity2 's @entity101			0
30 day trip : @entity9 ( @entity103 and @entity104 ) launched aboard a @entity98 rocket from @entity106 last night @entity9 , which is the size of a small car , is expected to reach the moon on oct. 6			1
scientists want to learn the composition of the moon 's ever - so - delicate atmosphere and how it might change over time			1
another puzzle , dating back decades , is whether dust actually levitates from the lunar surface			1
the $ 280 million moon - orbiting mission will last six months and end with a suicide plunge into the moon for @entity9			2
the 844 - pound spacecraft has three science instruments as well as laser communication test equipment that could revolutionize data relay			0
@entity2 hopes to eventually replace its traditional radio systems with laser communications , which would mean faster bandwidth using significantly less power and smaller devices			0
" there 's no question that as we send humans farther out into the solar system , certainly to @entity134 , " that laser communications will be needed to send high - definition and 3 - d video , said @entity2 's science mission chief , @entity139 , a former astronaut who worked on the @entity140			0
it was a momentous night for @entity141 , which was making its first deep - space liftoff			0
all of its previous launches were confined to @entity90 orbit			0
" it was just a beautiful evening , " @entity139 said			0
@entity2 chose wallops for @entity9 because of the @entity98 rocket , comprised of converted intercontinental ballistic missile motors belonging to the @entity98			0
a @entity150 - @entity149 treaty limits the number of launch sites because of the missile parts			0
all but one of @entity2 's previous moon missions since 1959 , including the manned @entity94 flights of the late 1960s and early 1970s , originated from @entity69			2
the most recent were the twin grail spacecraft launched almost exactly two years ago			2
the military - @entity158 rocketed away from @entity20 in 1994			0
wallops will be back in the spotlight in less than two weeks			0
the @entity5 - based @entity99 will make its first delivery to the @entity162 , using its own @entity164 rocket and @entity166 capsule			1
that commercial launch is scheduled for sept. 17			0
view from @entity79 : the launch was visible to millions of observers along much of the @entity7 , stretching from @entity171 to @entity36			0
it was the first - ever lunar mission launched from @entity5			1

@entity174 launched at *11:27* p.m. et from @entity5
@entity176 will study the lunar atmosphere and *environment*
@entity176 will have an orbiter to *gather* information on the moon
