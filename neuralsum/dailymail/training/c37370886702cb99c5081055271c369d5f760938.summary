as a statue of @entity3 ’s first black footballer was unveiled at @entity4 on thursday , it brought into focus the strides on racial inequality that have been made in our game and also the steps that still need taking			1
this 16ft bronze replica of @entity12 stands like a lightning rod for current debates about representation at the place where new generations of football minds will come to develop			1
one black player in the @entity20 in 1889			2
two black managers in the @entity20 in 2014 ; @entity22 at @entity23 , @entity24 at @entity25			2
more than a century of radical change has left some statistics looking static			2
the @entity12 statue was unveiled at the @entity4 's national football centre in @entity30 on thursday @entity31 and @entity32 were not aware of @entity12 ’s story when they were playing for @entity35 in the late 70s and early 80s , subjected to racist abuse from the terraces			1
they did not know how he had come to @entity39 from @entity40 , aged 19 , set a world record for the 100 - yard sprint and then begun playing as an amateur for @entity44			1
they did not know he subsequently moved to @entity46 , then signed professional forms as a goalkeeper for @entity49 and @entity50 in the top flight			1
they do know , some 125 years later , that the landscape of modern coaching is imbalanced and are able to detail why the @entity55 is needed to provide equilibrium			1
chairman of @entity4 , @entity58 , cuts the ribbon to unveil the statue of @entity12 ‘ the unveiling of @entity12 ’s statue is a really good touchstone for the contribution black footballers have made , ’ said @entity32 , who works with the @entity61 on a consultancy basis			1
‘ all of us have experienced racism , we know what we had to put up with			2
i can only imagine what he had to put up with in those days			2
‘ the significance is that while it has got a lot better over the years , it is still there in more subtle forms			1
we know the integration of black players has been phenomenal but there are still issues around inclusion			2
there is a parallel when you see a lack of black managers			2
’ this subject is live			2
@entity20 chairman @entity88 faced calls to resign after failing to raise the issue at the governing body ’s @entity91 last month , but has now launched a review into under - representation			1
replying to @entity99 ’s insistence there is ‘ no racism in football ’ , @entity96 vice-president @entity95 said racism was ‘ overt ’ in the @entity104 game and highlighted @entity107 youth coach @entity106 ’s inability to get job interviews			1
@entity12 , pictured in 1896 , was the world 's first black professional footballer ‘ sometimes people want to appoint in their own image , ’ said @entity32			1
‘ but how do you know you ’re getting the best candidate if you do n’t widen your scope ? ’ the solution , as @entity32 , @entity116 and many others observe , can be found across the @entity118			2
named after @entity119 , who implemented the legislation in @entity122 ’s @entity121 , the @entity55 would mean at least one candidate from a black and minority ethnic ( @entity125 ) background is interviewed for each major football role that becomes available at a club – from manager to first - team coach to academy head			1
it is not , despite some beliefs , a quota designed to give an unfair leg - up			1
it is a mechanism intended to ensure qualified individuals are given a chance to pitch themselves in front of a selection panel or chief executive			0
@entity142 , who won seven major honours during a 17 - year career at @entity145 , was a coach at the club between 1996 and 2003			1
but he left after failing to progress from his role overseeing the under - 13s despite gaining qualifications and guiding through the likes of @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154			1
@entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160 celebrate @entity44 fan @entity157 ( above ) founded the @entity161 to raise awareness he joined the @entity163 the following year and obtained his @entity164 in 2006 , the highest grade attainable			1
in his role as coach educator he talks to players about pathways in the game and leads courses up to @entity173 badge standard			0
' during my seven years coaching , more senior positions did become vacant at the club but although i was ambitious and dedicated to developing my career in coaching , i was never offered the chance to apply and so further opportunities never materialised for me , ’ said @entity142			1
' there was no process , somebody was all of a sudden in another position			0
i was overlooked three times			0
‘ unqualified people were allowed to leapfrog			0
i did speak to @entity189 , who tried to get the final decision altered , but i was very disillusioned and took myself out of the picture			0
i had a lot to offer			0
' there is a lot of frustration among players			0
i feel it when i speak to them at training grounds and a lot of this stems from bad practice and unfairness with regard to recruitment of coaches at clubs , even in cases where a player has played for a number of years and has the qualifications			1
there is also a general feeling amongst players that there is the perception black players are n’t interested in becoming managers and coaches			0
that is not the case			0
once people realise that the situation may change			0
' @entity4 chairman @entity58 talks to guests at the unveiling of the statue the point here is that we will never see more black managers if opportunities in their early careers are checked			1
around 25 per cent of professional footballers are non-white , but that figure translates to little more than two per cent in management			0
broaden that to the six big football jobs at clubs – 552 in @entity104 football – and almost three per cent ( 16 ) are performed by an individual of @entity125 background			1
@entity245 , under - 21s coach at @entity244 , is one			2
statistics show there is an eagerness to gain coaching qualifications			0
last year 45 of 238 people on @entity163 courses were black ( 19 per cent )			2
@entity32 believes those numbers will grow when a clear route is mapped out			0
‘ you do n’t invest in yourself when you think you have no chance , ’ he said			0
@entity24 at @entity25 is one of only two black managers in the @entity20 in 2014 when @entity32 and @entity31 played alongside @entity258 , it was viewed as a bold move by @entity35 to have three black players in the same team			0
it is quite remarkable to think that if a club , nearly 40 years later , were to appoint a black manager , black assistant and black first - team coach the response could be similar			1
@entity31 calls @entity12 ’s statue an ‘ inspiration ’ for all , no matter of colour			1
‘ it ’ s a universal message about following your dream and having character			0
’ he did just that and can recall the climate in his playing days , tracing it to the modern game			0
‘ managers had prejudices about black players handling the cold weather , being fancy dans , or too laid back , all those misconceptions , ’ @entity31 said			0
‘ we got over that			0
‘ now there seems to be misconceptions about black managers			0
you have to ask other people about why that is			0
we need to get answers from the people who make decisions			0

@entity12 was signed by @entity44 when he was 19 years old
@entity12 also went on to play for @entity46 , @entity49 and @entity50
in 1886 @entity12 became the @entity301 's national 100 - yard running champion
a statue was unveiled in *memory* of @entity12 at the @entity4 's national football centre in @entity30 on thursday
