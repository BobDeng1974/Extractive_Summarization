by @entity0 published : 18:39 est , 25 september 2012 updated : 18:39 est , 25 september 2012 when @entity3 bosses relocated from @entity4 to @entity5 , critics warned that the corporation ’s flagship morning news show would struggle to attract high - profile guests			1
now it appears those sceptical about the 200 - mile move north might have been right – as it emerged yesterday that filming of @entity14 ’s ‘ light news ’ slot could be returned to the capital			1
preliminary discussions have been held at the corporation about whether to turn the latter segment of the @entity3 show into a separate programme – possibly called @entity22 – which could be based in the @entity23			1
hosts @entity24 and @entity26 presenting at the @entity3 's new home in @entity5 insiders suggest there are concerns the section of the show between 8.30am and 9.15am – described as ‘ the bridge ’ , after its transition from morning news into daytime schedules – is not working well enough			2
among the concerns about the segment , which features celebrity interviews , are that its live guests are not of a high enough calibre			2
it was revealed in july that the show , hosted by @entity24 and @entity26 , was forced to conduct 12 interviews via video link in one week because guests were based in @entity4			1
among the ideas – said to be at an early stage – is to create an entirely separate show , which one executive suggested could be called @entity22			0
this would be similar to @entity54 ’s @entity53 in which @entity55 has her own separate show after the news - based section has finished			2
another option is to turn the last 45 minutes into a studio debate , or to dump this part of the programme altogether and ‘ stick to more news ’			0
supporters of this point out that at the moment the @entity67 channel stops taking footage from @entity14 at 8.30am , when it could run through to 9.15am			0
it emerged in july that the @entity3 had to conduct 12 interviews via videolink from its @entity5 base in one week because guests were based in @entity4 a senior @entity3 insider said : ‘ there has been a bit of discussion about what to do after 8.30am			1
one of the suggestions is a completely different programme for it – a @entity22			0
should it be a separate programme , or not ? and at what cost ? ’ however , many believe the @entity3 will ultimately decide against returning the 45 - minute slot to @entity4 , because it will look like ‘ an admission of failure ’ , another well - placed source at the broadcaster said			1
they added : ‘ i would be surprised if they move [ part of it back to @entity4 ]			2
it does not look good after such a short amount of time of it being up there			0
‘ it is a crucial part of the schedule so it ’s important it works			0
the celebs are not brilliant and it does n’t feel quite right			0
’ a @entity14 spokesman said : ‘ there are no plans to move any part of @entity14 back to @entity4			1
on the contrary , the show is working very well from @entity5 and we ’re delighted with the calibre of guests and experts regularly appearing			0

@entity117 may move segment of @entity14 back down south
@entity3 had to conduct 12 interviews by videolink in one week as guests were @entity4 - based
