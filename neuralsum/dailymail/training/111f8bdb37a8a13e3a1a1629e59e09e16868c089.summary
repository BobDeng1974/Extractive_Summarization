by @entity0 @entity1 : 01:33 est , 24 december 2013 @entity2 : 04:03 est , 24 december 2013 breaking silence : @entity4 gave his first interviews since seeking asylum in @entity7 last august in an story published by the @entity9 monday night six months after being forced to seek asylum in @entity7 , @entity11 whistle - blower @entity4 is content with the work he 's done to expose how the @entity15 government was spying on its own people			1
he told the @entity9 in his first interview since arriving in @entity18 that his ' mission 's already accomplished '			1
as soon as the journalists were able to work , everything that i had been trying to do was validated , ' he said			0
@entity4 explained that he was n't out to change society by releasing secrets on the @entity11 's wiretapping programs			1
he just wanted the public to have the information necessary to make a decision on whether they were comfortable with such wide - reaching intelligence gathering			0
this greater good has come at a huge personal cost to @entity4 , as a target appeared on his back the moment the first articles were published using his leaked information last may			2
by then , @entity4 was already out of the country in @entity38 , but he soon outstayed his welcome there			2
en route to @entity41 , the @entity15 cancelled his passport and he was stuck in limbo in the @entity18 airport			1
president @entity45 eventually agreed to give @entity4 a temporary asylum in the country last august , but @entity4 still seems uneasy in his current home			1
during his two days of interviews with the @entity9 , the reporter notes that the ' ascetic ' never goes outside once			2
@entity4 says he lives off ramen noodles and chips and spends most of his hours on the internet keeping up on the progress of his cause back in the states			0
no longer the company man : @entity4 became unwelcome in his own country last spring when he supplied journalists with information on how the @entity11 ( headquarters pictured above ) spies on @entity15 citizens ' it has always been really difficult to get me to leave the house , ' he said			1
' i just do n't have a lot of needs ... occasionally there 's things to go do , things to go see , people to meet , tasks to accomplish , but it 's really got to be goal - oriented , you know			0
otherwise , as long as i can sit down and think and write and talk to somebody , that 's more meaningful to me than going out and looking at landmarks			0
' @entity4 is believed to still have a cache of @entity11 documents in his possession , making him an uncomfortable @entity7 resident for the @entity85 administration			1
the administration has been staunchly against granting @entity4 asylum in exchange for him not releasing the rest of the documents , saying they intend to prosecute him if he ever returns to the country			2
but that 's not an opinion universally held			0
@entity94 , the @entity11 's incoming deputy director , told 60 minutes that @entity4 is estimated to be in the possession of 1.7million documents and that he would favor giving the whistleblower amnesty to get those secrets back			1
not welcome : @entity99 , national security adviser to president @entity85 , says she is against granting amnesty to @entity4 friendly chat : @entity4 speaks with ex- @entity15 intelligence officers in @entity7 last october there are already rumors that @entity4 may have already brokered the documents over to the @entity106 or @entity45 - his current protector			1
but @entity4 denies such allegations saying the documents were secured in a safe place , and that he does n't even have any of the information on his laptop 's hard drive or in @entity7 at all			1
' there is no evidence at all for the claim that i have loyalties to @entity7 or @entity106 or any country other than the @entity15 , ' he said			2
' i have no relationship with the @entity7 government			0
i have not entered into any agreements with them			0
' ' if i defected at all , ' @entity4 said			0
' i defected to the public			0

@entity4 leaked documents *detailing* the @entity128 's spying programs last may
in june he was trapped in @entity7 while en route to @entity41 when his passport was cancelled
in august , @entity7 president @entity45 granted him temporary asylum in the country
he gave his first interview since arriving in the country this week , telling the @entity9 that he 's happy with the work he has done to shed light on the @entity11 's *expansive* spying programs
