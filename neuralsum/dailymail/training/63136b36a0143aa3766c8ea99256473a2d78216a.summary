@entity0 has hit back at @entity2 ' claims that he ignored advice from @entity4 over @entity6 's recovery time			1
@entity2 was furious when @entity6 injured his thigh during the last @entity8 get together and he has n't played since the 1 - 0 victory over @entity10 early last month			1
the @entity4 manager insisted that @entity6 needs 48 hours to recover after a match , but @entity0 ignored the advice and forced the striker to train			1
@entity6 was injured in training for @entity8 in september resulting in him missing the opening @entity17 qualifier against @entity19 and a number of @entity4 matches @entity0 said : ' we have only a shortage of time			1
we have two games and two training sessions , we wanted to play him and @entity28 together against @entity19			0
' the injury was unfortunate but if i am going to be under pressure to give players two days off every time they play then we wo n't train			2
they ca n't have two days off			0
' he has not played for @entity4 since picking up the injury			2
if he was to get fitter during the international week then he will still have a lot of work to do to bring him up to speed for @entity4 anyway			2
there was no question of him being selected			0
@entity0 denied that there is any problem between him and @entity2 after the @entity4 manager warned him not to play @entity6			1
the @entity8 boss has not selected the striker for his squad to face @entity45 and @entity46 in their @entity48 qualifiers			1
@entity2 said that he had told @entity0 that @entity6 was not available for the national team , even though he could play some part of @entity4 's match against @entity52 on saturday before the @entity8 squad meet up			1
talking at @entity55 , the @entity4 boss said : ' i 've not spoken to @entity6 ( about the situation )			1
my focus is on @entity4 , it is not on @entity8			1
' i spoke to him about being available for @entity4 but i ca n't think about @entity8 when he is not ready to play for @entity4			1
@entity8 boss @entity0 has insisted players can not have two days off due to the proximity of matches ' he 's had a grade one injury for four weeks , which is a long time , and my focus is now getting him to play for @entity4			1
' i 've had good communication with @entity0			2
' we spoke at length yesterday on the situation and i said to him ' every individual player is different '			0
' i respect he had work to do internationally but my thoughts are with @entity4 players and what their needs are			2
' we agreed it was probably too soon for @entity6 to meet up with @entity8 , irrespective of whether he was involved this weekend or not			1
he has n't trained with the team at all since the injury with them and it was probably not the right time to go with them			0
' while there is no issue between himself and @entity0 , @entity2 would n't dismiss questions surrounding the two pairs of medical staff being at loggerheads			1
' it is not something to be discussed now , ' he said			0
' i do n't think the same thing will happen again			0
from the conversations with @entity0 they will obviously look at that			2
' i understand his position where he has only a few days to work with the players and he will probably take away that intensity on that second day but you can still work players , we work players here on the second day , but it needs to be tapered to the individual player			2
' @entity4 striker @entity6 has only managed to appear in half of his side 's @entity108 matches @entity2 told @entity0 that @entity6 would not be available for @entity8 but could play some part in @entity4 's match against @entity52 before the national team meet up @entity0 added : ' the last thing you want is injuries in training			1
you feel a responsibility to the clubs when you have their players and i can only think of three injuries with the national team in two and a half years i have been in charge			0
' i have n't been told he ca n't play for us			0
we have a right to pick players and we have a right to check on their fitness and assess them ourselves			0
it 's never happened in my two - and - a - half years and hope it never will			0
the way forward is to have dialogue with managers and players			0
' if he took some part at the weekend it 'll be very much at the beginning of his recovery			0
@entity142 going forward in december and march , a fully fit @entity6 is what i need			2
' i do n't seek ways in which i can assert my authority			0
i 'm happy with the way i use my authority			0
