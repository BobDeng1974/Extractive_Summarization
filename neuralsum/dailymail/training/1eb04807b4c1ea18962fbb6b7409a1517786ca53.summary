@entity0 let rip at referee @entity1 after @entity2 slipped to a 1 - 0 @entity4 defeat at home to @entity6			1
@entity7 struck the winner in the 68th minute to condemn the @entity9 to a third straight home loss			2
but @entity9 boss @entity0 was raging after @entity1 turned down what appeared to be a clear penalty for his side - and what should have subsequently been a red card for @entity6 goalkeeper @entity16 - after he sent @entity17 flying in the area shortly after half - time			1
@entity0 is raging after @entity2 's 1 - 0 defeat to @entity6 in their championship clash @entity9 striker @entity17 ( left ) appeared to be brought down by @entity6 keeper @entity16 striker @entity17 was through on goal and had touched the ball past the onrushing @entity16 before the pair collided , but @entity1 bafflingly gave nothing			1
and @entity29 boss @entity0 said : ' the biggest contentious issue of the whole game was very upsetting and very annoying			2
' if that 's not a foul then @entity17 should have been booked for diving			2
it was clear to @entity6 's bench , to be fair , they knew it should have been a penalty and down to 10 men , and that would have changed the complexion of the game			1
' do me a favour , book my man for diving or send their keeper off			0
do n't just play on ! ' @entity49 scored the winner for @entity6 to condemn @entity2 to a third consecutive home defat wanderers manager @entity52 ( left ) admits his side could have conceded a penalty at @entity29 wanderers manager @entity52 admitted his heart was in his mouth when @entity17 hit the deck			1
' it could easily have been given , ' he said			0
' @entity16 maintained @entity17 has gone into him , but the referee had a decision to make and thankfully it went our way			1
' i can understand @entity0 's frustration , we 're both in same position			2
maybe we 've had a stroke of luck			0
i do n't think the ref had a great game for either side			0
' @entity2 had the best two chances of the first half but @entity17 and @entity73 fired both of them wide			1
@entity75 was somehow denied a goal on the hour mark when his shot cannoned off the inside of the post , flew along the line and off @entity9 goalkeeper @entity82 's leg before rolling to safety			0
but @entity7 struck in the 68th minute when he collected @entity86 's fine pass , beat @entity87 on the edge of the area and arrowed his shot past @entity82 and into the net			0
@entity2 's @entity92 ( left ) missed a chance to score a late equaliser @entity92 could have equalised with five minutes remaining but , to add to @entity2 's frustration , @entity16 was out quickly to make a fine save			1
it was only @entity6 's second win on the road this season and lifted them up to 14th			0
@entity52 added : ' that 's the best we 've played away from home for a while			0
with the football we played and chances we created i thought we were good value for the win			0
