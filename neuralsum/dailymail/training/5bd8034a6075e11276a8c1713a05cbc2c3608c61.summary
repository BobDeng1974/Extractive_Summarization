when @entity0 became available as a beauty treatment six years ago it was hailed by many as nothing short of a miracle			1
a-listers such as @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 have all admitted to trying the popular treatment that promises to turn back time in just one session			2
but no matter how safe @entity0 claims to be , the thought of having purified botulinum toxin injected into your face is n't exactly tempting			1
now one revolutionary new product claims to be a no - toxin alternative that will freeze your wrinkles away instantly			1
@entity20 : hailed as the next generation @entity0 , a new procedure called iovera promises to freeze away wrinkles @entity23 , or ‘ @entity25 ’ as it has been nicknamed , is a toxin free wrinkle treatment designed to deliver immediate results with nothing left behind in the body			1
developed by a @entity31 - based medical technology group called myoscience , it temporarily treats horizontal and vertical forehead lines and wrinkles by administering two cold ' shots ' into each temple			0
the treatment , which has been hailed the next generation of @entity0 , uses a technique called cryoneuromodulation to banish fine lines and now it is available in the @entity42 for the first time at a @entity45 clinic			1
the 15 - minute procedure involves placing a device filled with liquid nitrogen next to the nerves that control the muscles that cause wrinkles			1
an intense cold shock puts the nerve into ‘ hibernation ’ for up to four months , so muscles relax and wrinkles disappear			1
it claims to be the perfect answer for needle - phobes due to its quick procedure and the fact that only a closed - end needle is used , and patients are said to experience the feeling as pressure rather than cold or pain			2
it also maintains that it can target nerves very precisely which means expressive muscles can still move to make facial expressions @entity71 claims : @entity72 claims to be the perfect answer for needle - phobes due to its quick procedure and patients are said to experience the feeling as pressure rather than cold or pain			2
dr @entity80 ( right ) is one of the first physicians in the @entity42 to be trained in and offer the new iovera toxin - free wrinkle treatment ‘ the liquid nitrogen freezes the targeted nerves on the forehead and between the brows , ’ says @entity45 plastic surgeon dr @entity80 , who has been trialling and refining the procedure developed by the @entity31 - based lab for more than a year			1
‘ this puts the nerves into temporary hibernation , so muscles relax and wrinkles disappear			0
‘ unlike @entity0 , which takes four days to work , the effects can be seen immediately and last for up to four months			1
and as nitrogen occurs naturally in the body - unlike @entity0 - you are n’t putting a foreign substance in to your system			1
’ but does it actually work ? @entity102 uses @entity103 which uses the power of cold for the application to precise targets			0
highly pressurised liquid nitrous oxide ( liquid cold ) travels at very high speeds down a fine @entity112 closed - end needle			0
at the needle tip it changes phase into gaseous form which draws in heat energy from the surrounding tissue to form a precise zone of cold			0
initial trials showed that all testers had fewer wrinkles after treatment			0
dr. @entity125 , from @entity126 , @entity45 , said : ' the effect is immediate but you ca n’t grade the response as far as i know			0
' to my knowledge it is been used mainly in forehead lines with the entry point close to the temple			0
' dr. @entity137 , @entity138 , who also carries out the procedure added : ' @entity140 is the world 's first toxin - free anti-wrinkle treatment - it 's a unique stand - alone treatment in its own right and should n't be compared side - by - side with @entity0 or any botulinum toxins			1
' instead , we should think of it as an additional option available to people , especially those who do not want botulinum toxin injections or can not have them due to medical reasons			0
' however , youth does n't come cheap and while @entity72 differs from @entity0 in many ways , they have similar price tags			2
a 15 - minute session will set you back £ 300			1
and while the beauty world is buzzing about the latest anti-ageing procedure , not everyone is @entity163 , joint medical director at @entity165 on @entity45 , said : ' @entity166 , which is what so called @entity25 is , is where you freeze the nerves in the face in an effort to remove wrinkles			2
' there is some degree of uncertainty with this procedure , as it is delivered in the hope that the right nerves can be hit to achieve the desired result			0
in my opinion the procedure is , therefore , far less predictable than @entity0			2
' @entity0 has been around for more than 30 years so medical practitioners , as well as most consumers , are aware that it is a safe and effective method			2
' we are also aware of the potential side effects involved in its administration			0
it is my opinion that more studies into the long term effects and potential benefits of @entity20 are needed before we can consider this a safe , viable alternative to @entity0			0
' @entity0 remains the best option to reduce the appearance of lines and wrinkles – it is predictable , safe and repeatable			0

@entity23 , or ‘ @entity25 ’ , is a toxin - free wrinkle treatment
has been hailed as the ' next generation of @entity0 '
claims to deliver more instant results than @entity0
15 minute session costs around £ 300 and the results last for three months
