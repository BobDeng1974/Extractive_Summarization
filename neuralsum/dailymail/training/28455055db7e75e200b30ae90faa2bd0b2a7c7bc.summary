a businessman fearing he had cancer after discovering blood in his urine has been left stunned after doctors discovered he has a fully functioning womb - and the blood was from his period			1
the 37 - year - old man , who @entity9 is not identifying , said he has experienced strange symptoms for years , such as a dull ache after sex , but his concerns were always brushed aside by medics			1
specialists have since discovered that , as well has having typical exterior male genitalia , he also has an interior uterus , cervix , fallopian tubes and ovaries			2
a 37 - year - old businessman has been shocked to learn he has a fully functioning womb in addition to the typical male genitalia after suffering from a rare genetic disorder they say he has been having periods since his teens , has experienced @entity29 , and may even be able to get pregnant			1
the man , from @entity31 , is now preparing for surgery to remove the womb having lived his whole life as a ' red blooded ' male , according to @entity36 doctors say this is the best way to treat the condition , but have warned him that he could start the menopause once the operation is complete			1
persistent @entity43 duct syndrome ( @entity44 ) is a rare genetic disorder which occurs when the body fails to produce or respond to certain hormones while developing during pregnancy			2
every foetus contains the beginnings of a womb , known as the @entity43 duct , but if the baby is male then it will produce hormones meaning this reduces and then disappears all together			2
however in those with @entity44 the body either does not produce these hormones , or does not react to them properly , meaning the duct develops into a functioning womb			2
because these hormones do not affect the growth of the penis , it means the child will also develop typical exterior male genitals			0
persistent mullerian duct syndrome is a genetic condition which means that both sets of genitals will form			0
symptoms include one or both testicles failing to descend , and fleshy hernias in the lower abdomen the syndrome is believed to be extremely rare , although the exact number of cases each year is largely unknown			0
the condition is usually spotted in early childhood or around puberty			0
symptoms include one or both testes failing to descend properly or fleshy hernias in the lower abdomen			0
the condition is usually discovered during surgery to treat these problems			0
all foetuses develop with the beginnings of a womb , known as the @entity43 duct			2
in the male foetus hormones will be produced causing this to shrink and eventually disappear			0
but in those with @entity44 these hormones will not be produced , or the body will not react to them			0
this means the @entity43 duct will develop into female sexual organs , including cervix , ovaries and uterus			1
because different hormones are responsible for growing a penis , the male reproductive organs will also develop			0
symptoms include one or both testicles failing to descend , and fleshy hernias in the lower abdomen			0
if the condition goes undiscovered into puberty , blood may also occur in the semen or urine after periods start			1
however in very exceptional cases the problem is not picked up by medics until adulthood , during which time the patient may have experienced blood in the semen or urine after starting periods , according to the @entity120			1
the businessman , who is in a relationship with a woman who knows about his condition , says the first sign something was wrong came at six months old , when he had an operation on an undescended testicle			0
he told @entity128 : ' as a child i did n't have any other problems and went through puberty normally , developing a deep voice and body hair			0
' but as i reached my teen and 20s i began experiencing a dull ache , during and after sex			1
' when he was 18 blood first appeared in his urine , leading doctors to suspect he had bladder cancer , but a biopsy came back negative			1
eventually he was sent for an mri , and the images revealed he has a uterus , fallopian tubes , ovaries , and even a cervix			1
a consultant has now told him that the ache after sex was caused by @entity29 , and the blood in his urine came from his periods			1
as well as surgery to remove the female organs , he will also take part in genetic screening to find out how his gender balances out			2
he added : ' it 's possible tests will show i 'm both male and female , but i feel completely right living life as a guy			0
even if tests showed i was mostly a woman , i would still continue living as a man			2
' the 37 - year - old is being sent for a hysterectomy at @entity172 - and has been told the operation may start the menopause ( file image )			1

man , 37 , experienced dull ache after sex and found blood in his urine
doctors sent him for @entity185 fearing he might have bladder cancer
but images showed he had a womb , including ovaries and cervix
@entity193 was actually @entity29 , and blood occurred while he was on his period
surgeons will now remove womb , but say it could start the menopause
