by @entity0 @entity1 : 05:52 est , 30 december 2013 @entity2 : 02:14 est , 31 december 2013 while satellites frequently beam down mesmerising images of @entity8 , detailed video footage of our planet has , up until now , been lacking			1
now one @entity10 - based start - up is aiming to change this by using its own low - cost satellite to provide the first ever public high - definition video of @entity8 from space			1
the footage reveals details down to the metre - scale , such as cars moving on roads and vessels travelling through shipping lanes - all from a satellite positioned 600 kms above the planet			1
pictured here is @entity31 in @entity32 the video was taken by the @entity28 - 1 satellite and showcases high - resolution views of @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , and @entity40 , @entity41			1
while it 's currently available for free , the group , @entity26 , plans to sell the footage to businesses in the near future			1
@entity28 - 1 , which was launched in november , captured up to 90 - second video clips at 30 frames per second to create the footage			1
the @entity50 group is now planning a constellation of 24 satellites that will be able to cover almost the entire expanse of the @entity8			2
@entity54 , which was launched in november , is capable of capturing up to 90 - second video clips at 30 frames per second			1
pictured here is a view of @entity31 satellites today are capable of taking imagery better than a metre in resolution , but they weigh thousands of kilograms			0
@entity54 is 20 times smaller than traditional satellites			0

the circuitry that drives it is about the size of a phone book and consumes less power than a 100w light bulb			0
the @entity50 group , @entity26 , is now planning a constellation of 24 satellites that will be able to cover almost the entire expanse of the @entity8			2
@entity79 , an identical version of @entity28 - 1 , is scheduled to launch in early 2014			1
its larger goal is to sell what it can analyse about the global economy to companies , providing details such as supply chain monitoring and the movement of humanitarian aid			2
‘ the most revolutionary fact is that @entity92 was built and launched for more than an order of magnitude less cost than traditional sub-meter imaging satellites , ’ said @entity90 , chief executive of @entity26			2

‘ their small size means we can afford to launch lots of satellites , and provide you lots of timely , sub-meter imagery and video , along with powerful derived analytics , ’ the group said on their website			0

it competitor , @entity121 - based @entity120 , is also planning to mount both a still and video camera onto the @entity123 to provide a similar service			0
