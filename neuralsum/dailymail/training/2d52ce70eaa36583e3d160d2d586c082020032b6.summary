the cry rang out on january 1 ; a warmly familiar sound , like the chimes of @entity3 or the singing of @entity5			2
@entity6 , pouting and paranoid , was cursing the wicked injustices and sinister incompetence of referees			1
a new year but an old , old whine			2
the occasion of the latest protest was @entity15 ’s emphatic 5 - 3 defeat at @entity16			1
the target could have been anybody with a whistle , but this time the honour fell to @entity21			1
early in the match , @entity21 had declined to award a penalty when the @entity16 defender @entity24 appeared to handle			1
the decision was patently honest yet probably mistaken			2
no matter ; @entity6 had identified his excuse and , as the @entity16 goals began to overwhelm his inept defenders , the @entity15 manager went through his objectionable routine			1
the provocation was relentless , all of it endorsed by the compliant lackeys on his bench			2
the entire performance was an exercise in self - indulgence and the interview which followed was a piece of ham - fisted malice			2
he was asked : ‘ was the “ campaign ” , the “ conspiracy ” against @entity15 , at work again ? ’ he replied , archly : ‘ it ’s a question i do n’t want to answer			1
’ later , still in full , drama - queen mode , he declared : ‘ every moment is unpredictable , but there are things which are becoming predictable			2
’ ‘ which are ? ’ inquired the interviewer			2
‘ forget it ! ’ sniffed @entity6 , subtle as a toddler ’s tantrum			1
clearly , he had prepared a diatribe over @entity21 ’s refusal to send off @entity75 for a challenge on @entity77			1
from his position , perhaps 60 yards away , he had been screaming for that red card			2
television evidence then demonstrated that @entity21 had spotted @entity75 ’s contact with the ball , a fact which hazard himself confirmed			1
it was n’t good enough for @entity6 , who resorted instead to the spurned penalty			1
‘ mr @entity21 was too slow to go with the ball , ’ he said			1
‘ he was 40 yards away			2
he made the right decision			0
the decision which was 10 metres away he could n’t make			0
’ referee @entity21 came under significant criticism from @entity6 after the game on @entity39 @entity91 of @entity15 complains to referee @entity21 about being kicked by @entity24 ( right ) he was asked about @entity92 , twice kicking at the back of @entity94 within three or four yards of his dugout			1
‘ i did n’t see that , ’ replied @entity6			1
it is worth regurgitating the details of his latest escapade , if only to illustrate his abiding philosophy			0
throughout his first spell at @entity102 , as well as his time in @entity103 and @entity104 , he repeatedly fell foul of authority through his aggressive attitude towards officials			0
some believe it is a calculated strategy to persuade his players that the world is in conspiracy against them			0
others insist it is simply a self - aggrandising desire to win every argument and pull every stunt in order to finish at the top of the heap			1
of course , he is not the only @entity122 manager to scapegoat referees			0
for some — and tedious grumps like @entity126 and @entity127 spring swiftly to mind — blaming the officials has become the default reaction			0
@entity131 at @entity132 may be painfully naive but he has swiftly acquired the same dubious habit			0
and for all his admirable qualities , even @entity134 seems to harbour a semi-permanent grudge			0
others , despite occasional lapses , appear rather more civilised , notably the two @entity140 managers , @entity141 and @entity142 , @entity143 at @entity144 and @entity145 at @entity146			0
their pressures are no less than the rest , yet their self - discipline seems more assured			2
@entity15 defender @entity92 appeared to kick @entity16 forward @entity94 during the second half @entity6 embraces @entity16 counterpart @entity151 following his defeat at @entity40 which brings us back to @entity6			1
unlike one or two of his contemporaries , he is not an obtuse man ; on the contrary , he plainly possesses an agile , original mind			0
as his record would attest , he is also remarkably good at his job			0
while many of us will always prefer the beautiful teams created by @entity164 or sir @entity165 , @entity6 ’s sides bear the hallmark of diligent coaching and intense efficiency			1
yet we sense he wants something else			0
he wants to be popular as well as successful ; not merely among those starry - eyed admirers who can see no further than the glitter of silver , but in a wider circle , one in which style and personal grace are valued as highly as the narrow - eyed accumulation of points			2
and it is here that @entity6 falls miserably short			1
as the new year episode demonstrated , he can not rid himself of the desire to bully and demean those who stand in his way , nor can he reject the temptation to preen and to posture , to constantly demonstrate his undoubted cleverness			1
every quarrel must be won , every grievance must be aired			0
and when things go badly wrong , every excuse , no matter how bogus , must be shamelessly paraded			0
he has received an array of blessings , yet crucially he has been denied a sense of self - awareness			2
in more than two decades of coaching and management , he has enjoyed major achievements , but he has also revealed significant weaknesses			0
at 51 , he still has time to take stock of his situation			0
we should hope that he uses it wisely			0
the hero who always delivered will leave a chasm the great football clubs revere their finest players , but at @entity209 they cherish their legends more dearly than most			1
names like @entity212 and @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 and @entity216 , right through to the capricious @entity217 , form the currency of conversations on @entity220			0
yet there is just one man who perfectly represents the soul and the spirit of the team in red			0
@entity227 , who has announced that he will be leaving at the end of the season , is the captain from @entity230 ; not simply a sensational footballer , but a man whose energy and pride has so often captivated a club , a city and a sporting nation			1
ever since the news was announced , we have been treated to tales of that wondrous evening in @entity241 , when he won the @entity244 final virtually single - handed			2
there was also a magical day in @entity246 , when he practically seized the @entity248			0
@entity227 knocks home a penalty at @entity220 against @entity250 in the @entity122 on @entity39 @entity251 joins his captain to show off the @entity248 after @entity209 's triumph in 2006 but while his career was alive with dramatic occasions and rousing triumphs , the lingering memory will be of the individual who delivered them			1
@entity227 was the finest @entity260 midfield player of his generation by some considerable distance , but he was a good deal more than that			1
he possessed the kind of gifts which the @entity260 crave in their football heroes			0
he carried himself with the style and purpose of the chosen ones , a square - shouldered , sturdy - chested athlete with running power capable of carrying him through a string of testing seasons			2
then there was the touch ; delicate when required , subtle when needed , but always applied with devilishly shrewd intent			0
@entity227 hoists the trophy after inspiring the miracle of @entity241 and crowning @entity209 @entity283 champions @entity227 scored two penalties against @entity250 on @entity39 in final game before announcing departure we marvelled , too , at the alliance of impeccable technique and latent strength ; the cross-field pass arrowed through 50 undeviating yards , or those surging sprints , which disdained challenges and concluded in violent drives			1
but above and beyond all this , there was the belief that this outwardly reticent character with the nervous frown and the decent distaste for the spotlight could achieve astonishing things through the ferocity of his ambition			0
time and again , he repaid that faith			0
an uncommon man , is @entity227			1
he will leave not a gap , but a chasm			1
@entity312 @entity313 is the chairman of @entity314			1
he is a pleasant , personable man with a dry sense of humour			0
his football judgment , however , is another matter			0
this season , he decided to take on the @entity122 with @entity320 as his manager			0
@entity320 was hopelessly out of his depth and , to nobody ’s surprise , he sank without trace			0
@entity314 chairman @entity313 alongside new boss @entity326 ( left ) at @entity327 on @entity39 mr @entity313 has now turned to @entity326			1
years of relentless underachievement at @entity329 have not shaken @entity326 ’s confidence ; indeed , when it comes to self - promotion , @entity326 can make @entity6 seem shyly insecure			1
there are interesting times ahead			1
i fancy mr @entity313 will need his sense of humour .			0

@entity6 targeted referee @entity21 after 5 - 3 defeat to @entity16
@entity15 boss believed his side should have been award first half penalty
ca *n't* rid himself of desire to bully and demean those who stand in his way
