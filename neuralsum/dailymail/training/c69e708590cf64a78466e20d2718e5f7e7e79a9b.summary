as the clock winds down to dec. 21 , experts on the maya calendar have been racing to convince people that the @entity4 did n't predict an apocalypse for the end of this year			1
some experts are now saying the @entity4 may indeed have made prophecies , just not about the @entity6			1
archaeologists , anthropologists and other experts met friday in the southern @entity12 of @entity13 to discuss the implications of the @entity15 calendar , which is made up of 394 - year periods called baktuns			1
expectations : with the @entity19 , pictured , ending on or around december 21 some fear it means the people believed it to be the end of the world experts estimate the system starts counting at 3114 b.c. , and will have run through 13 baktuns , or 5,125 years , around dec. 21			2
experts say 13 was a significant number for the @entity4 , and the end of that cycle would be a milestone â€” but not an end			1
fears that the calendar does point to the end have circulated in recent years			0
people in that camp believe the @entity4 may have been privy to impending astronomical disasters that would coincide with 2012 , ranging from explosive storms on the surface of the sun that could knock out power grids to a galactic alignment that could trigger a reversal in @entity47 's magnetic field			1
@entity49 government archaeologist @entity48 said on friday that the @entity4 tried to make predictions , but perhaps about more humdrum events like droughts or disease outbreaks			2
@entity54 's remains : the @entity57 temple at @entity58 , @entity55 is seen where the people 's culture of writing , astronomy and temple complexes flourished from years 300 to 900 ' the @entity64 did make prophecies , but not in a fatalistic sense , but rather about events that , in their cyclical conception of history , could be repeated in the future , ' said @entity48 , of the @entity71			1
@entity72 plans : arguing @entity57 prophecies beyond 2012 , king of @entity74 , @entity75 , pictured , said he would return to @entity47 a couple thousands years from now in the future experts stressed that the ancient @entity4 , whose ' classic ' culture of writing , astronomy and temple complexes flourished from the year 300 to 900 , were extremely interested in future events , far beyond dec. 21			1
' there are many ancient @entity4 monuments that discuss events far into the future from now , ' wrote @entity87 , an anthropologist at the @entity88			2
' the ancient @entity4 clearly believed things would happen far into the future from now			2
' ' the king of @entity74 , @entity75 , believed he would return to the @entity47 a couple of thousand years from now in the future , ' @entity87 wrote in an email to @entity93			0
' moreover , other monuments discuss events even before the creation in 3114 b.c. ' only a couple of references to the 2012 date equivalency have been found carved in stone at @entity102 , and neither refers to an apocalypse , experts say			0
such apocalyptic visions have been common for more than 1,000 years in @entity107 , @entity106 thinking , and are not native to @entity4 thought			1
' this is thinking that , in truth , has nothing to do with @entity57 culture , ' said @entity112 , an anthropologist at the @entity113 , a state on @entity12 's @entity116 coast			0
' this thing about looking for end - times is not something that comes from @entity57 culture			0
' @entity87 compared the @entity4 , with its system of cycles within cycles , to the series of synchronized wheels contained in old , analogue car odometers			0
' the maya long count system is like a car odometer , ' @entity87 wrote			0
' my first car ( odometer ) only had six wheels so it went up to 99,999.9 miles			0
that did n't mean the car would explode after reaching 100,000 miles			0

experts say @entity4 made prophecies but none about the @entity6
other prophecies made by @entity64 go beyond 2012 believing more years to come
