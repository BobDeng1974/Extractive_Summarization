by @entity0 , business correspondent published : 17:48 est , 16 october 2012 updated : 04:25 est , 17 october 2012 snail mail : your letters may take longer to arrive under a new systee being considered by @entity5 first class post could be axed under proposals published yesterday by the industry regulator			1
@entity5 is considering scrapping the two - tier system of first and second class post which has been in place for more than 40 years			1
instead they may be merged into one service which would see a letter taking two days to arrive , according to proposals set out yesterday			0
at present , it costs 60p for a first class stamp for a letter to arrive the next working day , and 50p for second class which should arrive within three working days			2
but @entity5 says it is thinking of replacing this system with one in which a stamp costs around 53p and letters take two days to arrive			1
it said : ‘ the benefits of a next day service would appear to be diminishing over time as the use of other communication methods can fulfil the need for speed			0
’ the proposals follow a survey , described by @entity5 as the largest - ever poll of users of the postal service about what they need from the @entity37			1
the report concludes that ‘ a significant proportion of first class mail does not actually need to arrive the next day ’ , adding that it is ‘ expensive ’ to provide the current service			2
@entity5 said the most popular option – backed by 59 per cent of users – was the alternative one - price system , rather than the current two - tiered option			1
its 144 - page report also considered stopping postmen from having to deliver post through people ’s letterboxes			1
instead , post could be left in a ‘ secure locker ’ in a train station or village hall , or placed in ‘ a secure weatherproof box ’ at the edge of a property , according to the report			0
but @entity5 said the majority of people surveyed were ‘ strongly against ’ this idea			2
@entity5 also considered the idea of cutting the number of deliveries per week			1
at present , @entity37 is legally bound to pick up and deliver letters six days a week for the same price – known as the ‘ universal service ’			2
but the report suggests that changing this is unlikely , stating : ‘ the government has indicated it has no intention to change at present			0
’ @entity73 , director of postal policy at @entity74 , said its own research found many people were ‘ happy ’ with the idea of just a single class of post			0
but he added : ‘ a premium product that guarantees a next day delivery must remain an option for special circumstances			0
’ @entity85 , general secretary of the @entity86 , said : ‘ we want to see innovation , not cuts , in order to improve service standards			0
’ a @entity93 spokesman said : ‘ the minimum requirements of the universal service , such as the six - day letters service , can not be changed by @entity5			1
‘ those requirements can only be changed by @entity98			0
’ but @entity5 has the power to merge first and second class post into one service			1
its proposals are subject to a public consultation , which closes on december 18			0
it must publish its decision by march 31 , 2013 .			0
