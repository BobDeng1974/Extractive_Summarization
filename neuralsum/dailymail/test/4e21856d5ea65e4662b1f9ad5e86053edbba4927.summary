the top of the @entity1 with five games to go after another barmy day in the @entity1 we are still no closer to finding out which three clubs will be promoted to the @entity5			1
eight sides still have a chance of claiming one of the two automatic promotion places , even with just five games left to play of the regular season			2
and then there are the play - offs – notoriously hard to call but surely even more so this season given the fine margins that separate this year 's promotion - chasing crop			2
regardless of who goes up though , there have been some stellar individual performances this season that will no doubt have attracted top flight attention			1
here are eight players - one each from @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 - that could well be playing in the top flight next season regardless of whether their club goes up or not			1
@entity36 scores as @entity26 beat @entity27 on monday in a crucial clash in the championship @entity39 club : @entity24			1
though left - footed , @entity39 operates on the right flank and his energy and eye for a goal sum up @entity52 's attacking side			0
a product of @entity55 's academy , he never got a look - in at @entity57 and has risen through the lower leagues and now looks destined for the top flight			2
it was the @entity62 international 's £ 400,000 move to @entity24 from @entity63 in january 2013 that triggered @entity65 's dramatic resignation at the @entity66			0
@entity24 winger @entity39 celebrates as @entity24 beat @entity67 on @entity68 @entity69 club : @entity25			2
@entity25 did well to hang on to @entity69 after being relegated last summer and if they do n't make an immediate return he will surely still be back in the @entity5 - where he proved a reliable performer for the three seasons prior to this - come august			1
a powerful , deep - lying midfielder with a solid all - round game , the @entity81 man has added goals to his repertoire this season , scoring more in 38 games than he had in his previous four seasons			1
experienced midfielder @entity69 has been in prolific form in front of goal this season @entity36 club : @entity26			1
@entity36 has plundered 63 goals in the @entity1 in the past three seasons and with his 27th birthday approaching in the summer he surely has to be playing in the @entity5 next season			1
a product of @entity103 's academy , @entity36 served three months in prison for affray in 2012 and has impressively rebuilt his career and life since			0
@entity36 has been consistently excellent for @entity26 over the last three seasons @entity109 club : @entity27			2
having spent spells on loan from @entity118 at @entity119 , @entity28 and @entity27 in @entity120 and now the @entity1 , the next step in @entity123 's progression will be in the @entity5 next season			1
if @entity27 go up , @entity125 will surely be happy for the @entity126 under 21 international to continue under the tutelage of his former no 2 and @entity27 boss @entity130			0
if not , there will be plenty of other suitors for the tall , versatile forward			0
@entity109 ( centre ) moved to the @entity136 on a season - long loan deal from @entity118 last summer @entity138 club : @entity28			1
not 20 until later this month , @entity138 will be a name familiar with many of our readers given his exploits for @entity151 's @entity126 under 21 side , for whom he has 14 caps			0
making his debut as a 17 - year - old , the elegant left - footed midfielder has already played over 130 times for @entity28 and has no shortage of admirers among the @entity5 's elite			1
@entity28 midfielder @entity138 has plenty of experience despite still being a teenager @entity164 club : @entity29			2
when @entity164 moved to @entity29 for £ 4million from @entity171 he would have had hopes of playing in the @entity5 before too long			1
instead , he found himself in @entity120 a year later			0
to his credit though , he stayed and spearheaded @entity29 ' romp to the @entity120 title last year and has been the key man in their bid to make it back - to - back promotions			0
his contract is up this summer and a new one will only be signed if @entity29 achieve that			0
@entity164 ( centre ) has become a cult hero at @entity183 but looks certain to leave if @entity29 do n't go up @entity184 club : @entity30			2
another side bidding for back - to - back promotions are @entity30 and @entity194 loanee @entity184 has been key in their surprise success story			0
short , agile , quick and versatile , @entity184 is in the @entity197 mould of midfielder we have been craving for so long in this country			0
given @entity203 's track record of developing youth it would n't be a surprise to see him in @entity194 ' squad next season though they may opt to loan him out to a smaller @entity5 club			1
@entity184 takes on @entity209 's @entity210 during an under 21 international last month @entity211 club : @entity31			0
linked with @entity219 and @entity220 in january , @entity218 ' form has tailed off of late with @entity31 's but he has all the attributes required to succeed at the highest level			0
tall for a full back at 6ft 5in @entity211 is nonetheless quick and full of attacking intent			0
he was let go by both @entity226 and @entity227 as a teen before arriving at @entity31 in 2012 via non-league			0
@entity31 defender @entity211 attracted interest from @entity5 clubs in january we ’ve also come up with a composite xi made up by the best players from the eight clubs			1
this side would surely stay up in the @entity5 with ease ... @entity238 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity239 ( @entity25 ) ; @entity240 ( @entity29 ) , @entity241 ( @entity25 ) , @entity242 ( @entity24 ) , @entity211 ( @entity31 ) ; @entity138 ( @entity28 ) , @entity69 ( @entity25 ) ; @entity39 ( @entity24 ) , @entity184 ( @entity30 ) , @entity164 ( @entity29 ) ; @entity36 ( @entity26 ) .			2
