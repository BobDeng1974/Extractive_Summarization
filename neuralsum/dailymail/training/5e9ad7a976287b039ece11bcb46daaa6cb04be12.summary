more than 100 homes a week are being seized from elderly people by councils to pay for their care home fees			1
families have been forced to hand over properties because local authorities are refusing to pay for the care			1
the scale of the confiscations – revealed yesterday by a @entity10 – will pile pressure on the government to help the thousands of families forced to pay ruinous care fees			1
up to that point , all those with assets of more than £ 23,250 are expected to pay their own way – even if that means selling the family home or agreeing to surrender it when their relative dies			1
between 30,000 and 40,000 people a year are thought to lose their homes this way			1
critics say the system denies families their inheritances and punishes those who have worked hard , saved and paid mortgages			1
the figures – gathered by the finance firm @entity44 – showed that over the past five years councils have taken legal action to secure a share in more than 3,000 older peoples ’ homes each year			2
from 2009 to 2014 the 72 councils questioned put a charge on 15,174 homes			0
older people with assets of more than £ 23,250 , must pay their own care bills			1
many are forced to sell their homes to meet the costs , which are close to £ 600 a week for an average care home place			1
councils take out a legal charge on a property when an older person will not pay care bills , and the council has to cover the cost			1
often the family has failed to sell the home			0
some try to give their property to their children if they suspect they will need costly care			0
but they must still pay care bills for seven years after the gift is made			1
during this time , the council will put a charge on the property			0
a charge is also taken out in the ‘ deferred payment ’ scheme , which allows the person to stay in their home			0
the charge ensures the council can seize and sell the property after the owner dies			0
the number of properties targeted annually rose by more than 10 per cent over the period – from 2,816 in 2009/10 to 3,109 in the financial year which ended in march			0
on average , there were more than eight charges on homes every day			0
however , if the councils which did not provide @entity95 answers have been taking homes at the same rate , numbers will be nearly 17 a day , well over 100 a week			0
the thousands of homes taken without dispute , from families who agree to sell up and settle their bills before legal pressure from the town hall , are not included in the figures			2
in cases where the local authority agrees that the family can delay paying care costs until after the relative has died and their home is sold , councils often treat continued use of the property as a form of loan – and will charge high interest rates when the home is sold			1
@entity118 , of @entity119 , said : ‘ we know that every day , thousands of families face agonising decisions about care … where dwindling savings are just not enough to meet rocketing care costs			1
’ she added : ‘ the government needs to help people understand … how the system will work and what they will actually have to pay , and ensure a care system is in place that is fit for today ’s older people and future generations			2
’ seizure of homes happens because of the means test system that affects people who need to go into care homes or have help at home			2
councils carry out the means tests and insist those with property sell it to meet the costs of their care – unless there is a spouse , a disabled relative or a child still living there			2
people who have no savings and own no property are given free care home places paid for by councils			2
many cases included in the figures involve people who have failed to pay their bills and now face legal action by local authority lawyers			0
others are a result of ‘ deferred payment ’ schemes , in which people live in their homes while the council provides care , but the council takes the property after their death			0
@entity174 , mp for @entity175 , said the system is ‘ grotesquely unfair ’ .			0

between 30,000 *-* 40,000 thought to lose homes this way every year
@entity19 promised a cap on care costs by 2016 , but this will only apply to bills of £ 72,000 or more
those with assets of more than £ 23,250 are expected to pay their own way
critics say the system denies families their inheritances and punishes those who have worked hard , saved and paid mortgages
