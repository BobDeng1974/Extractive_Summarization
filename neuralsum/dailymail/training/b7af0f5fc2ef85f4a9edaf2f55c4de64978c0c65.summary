by @entity0 @entity1 had repeated episodes of feeling dizzy and sometimes passing out when @entity1 saw her gp about dizzy spells , she could tell she was n't being taken seriously - and she could understand why			1
' i was 30 , did n't smoke , ate healthily , drank little and trained with my rowing club five times a week , ' says @entity1 , now 39 , a business project manager from @entity8 , @entity9			1
' i could see the doctor mentally giving me the all - clear before even checking my pulse and blood pressure , which both proved normal			0
' @entity1 had suffered from sporadic dizzy spells since childhood , but over the years they gradually became more frequent and frightening , and by the time she saw her gp , she had them most days - sometimes several times a day			1
' if i was walking and could n't hold on to something when one of these attacks happened , i 'd fall , but mostly it happened when i was sitting			2
all of a sudden i felt i was swirling under water and drowning , and needed to focus on not being sick			0
' then , within no more than ten seconds , i 'd jolt back to normal , so people never noticed			2
because i seemed healthy , the gp concluded it was stress from work			2
but i was convinced something was wrong			0
' the dizzy spells continued and , over the next three years , @entity1 returned to her gp practice four times , seeing different doctors , who agreed it was probably stress			1
at this time she was so desperate for an answer , she had a private medical screening through work			0
' it included an @entity40 ( electrocardiogram ) that measured electrical activity in my heart for a minute or two			2
but the doctor said i was one of the fittest people he 'd seen			2
so i decided to try not to let my dizzy spells bother me			1
' but two years later , in january 2009 , @entity1 lost consciousness - coming round in a pool of blood in her bathroom			1
' i must have fallen backwards on to the door catch , leaving a 7in gash in my back , then gone forward , hitting my head on the bath			0
i was very shaken and worried about collapsing again			0
' she returned to her gp a few days later asking for another @entity40 , and the doctor reluctantly referred her for one at @entity60 , @entity9			0
there she was fitted with a 24 - hour @entity40 monitor			0
' frustratingly , i did n't have a dizzy spell that day , ' says @entity1			1
' i wanted something to show up because i was sure i had a heart condition			1
' on the morning she returned the monitor , the hospital called and asked her to go straight to @entity70 where she was admitted immediately			0
a cardiologist explained that during the 24 - hour test - even without having a dizzy spell - her heart had paused 60 times			1
@entity1 had a ' heart block ' , a condition common in elderly people , and a natural result of ageing , but which can occur in the young , too			1
' it 's a problem with the wiring of the heart , ' explains professor @entity84 , medical director of the @entity85 and former professor of cardiovascular medicine at @entity88			2
' a normal heartbeat is initiated by an electrical signal from the heart 's natural pacemaker , the sinoatrial node in the right upper chamber of the heart			2
one in five @entity98 has had to have stronger medication because they put off seeing their doctor about worrying symptoms , a survey for the @entity97 found			0
' with heart block - also called atrioventricular block or av block - the signals are partially or totally blocked between the upper chambers [ atria ] and lower chambers [ ventricles ] , which pump blood around the body			1
this is because the wiring either conducts the impulse abnormally slowly , or the wiring is broken , so the impulse does n't get through at all			2
' the heartbeat can become extremely slow , pausing occasionally - causing dizziness - but then restarts as other pacemaker cells in the heart take over			2
' so why did @entity122 's diagnosis take so long ? most gps see thousands of patients suffering with dizzy spells , usually with no major underlying cause - which means they may not think that something serious is causing them			1
while a standard @entity40 is a cheap and easy way to diagnose heart conditions such as heart failure or valve disease , it wo n't detect heart rhythm problems if they are intermittent and do not occur during the reading - that requires continuous @entity40 monitoring for days			1
there are different types of heart block			1
first and second - degree heart block - both affecting one in 50 otherwise healthy adults - occur when electrical impulses are slow or fail to reach the ventricles , potentially causing dizziness			1
third - degree heart block , or complete heart block , which @entity1 has , is when no electrical impulses from the upper chambers of the heart reach the pumping chambers			1
instead , the heart keeps beating only thanks to cells in the ventricles stimulating a heartbeat - but because this kind of heartbeat has an extremely low rate , it can affect blood flow , leading to a raised risk of fatigue , dizziness , light - headedness , blackouts and cardiac arrest			0
@entity1 had a ' heart block ' , a condition common in elderly people , and a natural result of ageing , but which can occur in the young , too heart block can occur from birth or be acquired			1
ironically , athletes may be at greater risk			0
as professor @entity84 explains : ' heart rate is controlled by the vagus nerve , running from the base of the brain to the abdomen , which transmits signals through the body			0
it acts as a natural brake on the heart 's pacemaker cells , particularly when we 're at rest or asleep			0
' the more physically fit a person , the higher their “ vagal tone ” , which means it acts even more as a brake , lowering heart rate so the electrical impulses are slow			0
' other causes of first and second - degree heart block include inflammation of the heart muscle ( myocarditis - usually caused by a virus ) , or low levels of potassium or magnesium in the blood , caused by extreme dieting , kidney conditions , damage from heart attack and @entity212 ( a bacterial infection spread by ticks )			1
some heart and blood - pressure medicines - including calcium channel blockers and digoxin - can also delay electrical signals passing through the atrioventricular node ( which electrically connects the upper and lower chambers of the heart )			0
third - degree heart block is normally caused by heart damage as a result of heart surgery , coronary heart disease , trauma , infection or radiotherapy			1
up to 10 per cent of over- 70s with a history of heart disease develop complete heart block			1
often , first and second - degree heart block patients are not treated and only monitored if they have no symptoms and no cause , such as medications , can be found			1
for other heart blocks , pacemakers , which stimulate heartbeat by firing electrical impulses , are advised			0
it 's thought @entity1 's heart block was caused by an underlying problem , probably from birth			1
' it 's likely it was exacerbated by her extreme fitness , ' adds professor @entity250 , consultant cardiologist at @entity251			0
' you can not predict when a long , life - threatening pause may occur in patients , so it 's vital a pacemaker is fitted quickly			0
' @entity1 had hers implanted in january 2009			2
' getting used it wore me out			0
i was worried for the first six weeks , when muscles need to grow around it to avoid the risk of pulling the wires out - this can happen with awkward movements			0
' because of this risk , she 's had to stop rowing			0
the good news is she has n't had any dizzy spells since			1
' after my diagnosis , my gp half - heartedly apologised , but said : “ we 're not trained to look for people like you			0
” i could have been angry , but instead feel lucky to have a second chance			0
' @entity1 is supporting the @entity85 's @entity276 next month - visit rampupthered.org.uk			2

when @entity1 was 30 she saw @entity271 about dizzy spells
was healthy and did n't smoke , so could tell she was n't being taken seriously
@entity1 , now , 39 , had a ' heart block ' , a condition common in elderly people
