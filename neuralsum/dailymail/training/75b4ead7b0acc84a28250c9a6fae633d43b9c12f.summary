by @entity0 published : 19:37 est , 24 december 2012 updated : 19:37 est , 24 december 2012 the @entity1 has urged people not to feel bad about shopping online on christmas day , despite concerns about the increased commercialisation of @entity5			1
the statement , from @entity1 spokesman @entity7 , comes after @entity8 , the former archbishop of @entity9 , said that @entity5 was a ' precious time ' for families that was in danger of being overtaken by gadgets			1
but mr @entity7 urged people not feel guilty about spending a little time shopping online as long as they make time to go to a church service and spend time with their loved ones on christmas day			1
he said : ' what really matters is that people make time to go to church , to have a family @entity5 lunch , to open presents with their families - and maybe spend a bit of time online spending their new @entity5 vouchers			1
' balance : @entity1 spokesman @entity7 said people should not feel ashamed of shopping online as long as they spend time with family and at church over the festive period ' nothing is black and white in life and no - one is going to spend 24 hours shopping			1
' this is a way for retailers to get the message out that they are open for business			0
' people need variety in life			0
' nearly 1.5million people are expected to log on today as firms start their online sales in what will be the busiest ever @entity5 for shopping			1
last - minute bargain hunters were cashing in on internet sales yesterday as online retailers slashed their prices earlier than the traditional boxing day sales			1
@entity8 , the former archbishop of @entity9 , said that @entity5 was a ' precious time ' for families that should not be overrun by presents and gadgets the @entity56 online sale began at noon , with @entity57 following suit at 5pm and @entity59 at 7pm			2
online giant @entity60 will start its sale on christmas morning , a day earlier than usual			1
high - street spending in the run - up to @entity5 has been ' acceptable but not exceptional ' , the retail industry trade association said today			2
spending over the final weekend before @entity5 hit the predicted Â£ 5billion , according to the @entity65 ( @entity65 ) , but swathes of retailers still risk going under after the festive period			2
as more shoppers flock to the web rather than the shops to buy presents , high - street retailers face the threat of closure , business recovery group @entity69 warned			0
almost 140 firms were in a critical condition in the fourth quarter , meaning they are on the brink of collapse , while more than 13,700 were in ' significant ' distress - up 35 % during the three months to december 17 , the @entity69 report said			0
but the @entity65 's head of media and campaigns @entity86 said poor accessibility on high streets , a lack of parking and weak consumer demand were to blame rather than an increase in online shopping			2
but he acknowledged that some high - street retailers would ' undoubtedly ' fail after @entity5			0
' retail sales over the weekend have been up to expectations but expectations were relatively modest , ' said mr @entity86			0
' @entity5 will turn out to be acceptable but not exceptional			0
' he went on : ' there are a lot of myths around online retail			0
ten per cent of overall retailing over the year comes from online shopping and actually it presents lots of opportunities for the retail sector			2
' the lines are becoming increasingly blurred with things like click and collect			0

@entity1 spokesman says online shopping is ok , as long as you spend time with your family and at church
christmas day ' is not about self - *denial* '
