by @entity1 reporter last updated at 12:00 am on 3rd february 2012 malaria is killing almost twice as many people around the world than was previously thought , a study has shown			1
more than 40 per cent of the victims are older children and adults , challenging the belief that the vast majority of deaths occur among the under - fives			0
the infectious disease claimed 1.2 million lives worldwide in 2010 , according to the new research			0
a mosquito feeding on human blood : malaria is a disease caused by parasites transmitted by infected mosquitoes this is nearly twice the number cited in a report from the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) published last year			1
the scientists , led by dr @entity26 , from the @entity27 ( @entity27 ) at the @entity28 , @entity29 , analysed all available data on malaria mortality from 1980 to 2010			1
their findings , published in @entity34 medical journal , showed consistently higher death tolls than those in the 2011 @entity37			1
for children younger than five in @entity40 , death estimates were 1.3 times higher			2
for children and adults in @entity40 they were 8.1 times higher , and for individuals of all ages outside @entity40 they were 1.8 times higher			0
worldwide , 433,000 more people over the age of five had been killed by malaria than who estimates suggested			2
' you learn in medical school that people exposed to malaria as children develop immunity and rarely die from malaria as adults , ' said dr @entity26			2
' what we have found in hospital records , death records , surveys and other sources shows that just is not the case			1
' the better news was that after peaking in 2004 at 1.8 million , the number of fatal malaria cases had fallen each year			1
between 2007 and 2010 they had seen an annual decline of more than seven per cent			0
the trend was chiefly due to health initiatives driven by major aid organisations such as the @entity74 , said the researchers			0
' we have seen a huge increase in both funding and in policy attention given to malaria over the past decade , and it 's having a real impact , ' said co-author dr @entity82 , from the @entity83 in @entity84			2
' @entity85 demonstrating just how big an impact is important to drive further investments in malaria control programmes			0
this makes it even more critical for us to generate accurate estimates for all deaths , not just in young children and not just in @entity40			0
' with the larger number of deaths , the goal of reducing malaria mortality to zero by 2015 might be unrealistic , the researchers pointed out			1
they wrote : ' we estimated that if decreases from the peak year of 2004 continue , malaria mortality will decrease to less than 100,000 deaths only after 2020			0

@entity29 study found malaria death rate twice the number cited by @entity24
