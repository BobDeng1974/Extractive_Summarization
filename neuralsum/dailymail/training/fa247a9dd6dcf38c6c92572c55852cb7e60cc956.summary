this is the moment two heartless thieves stole £ 700 of @entity3 money from an elderly couple after pretending to ask for directions			1
moments earlier the ‘ despicable ’ con artists had followed the couple – both aged in their 80s – around a bank and watched them withdraw their savings			2
@entity12 cameras capture the moment one of the men distracts the grandparents by pretending to be lost , while his partner swoops			2
criminals : police are hunting for two thieves who stole a vulnerable couple 's £ 700 @entity3 savings by distracting them claiming they were lost sickening : one man asked the pensioners for directions while the other rifled through a bag and stole a wallet as the pensioners load their shopping into the boot of their car , one man keeps them engaged in conversation , encouraging them to turn their backs to the vehicle			1
meanwhile , his accomplice can be seen lurking in the background before he sneaks up behind them			2
he then reaches into the woman ’s handbag , snatches her purse and walks off			0
the first thief then quickly concludes his conversation , appearing to thank the pensioners for their directions , before following his accomplice			1
yesterday , @entity45 released the 45 - second cctv footage in a bid to catch the men			0
hundreds posted links to the footage on @entity52 and @entity53 in a bid to find the ‘ vile ’ thieves			0
do you know these men ? detectives believe these are the men responsible for the wallet snatch detective sergeant @entity59 said the men struck at 10.30am on november 25 , on @entity60 in @entity61			1
he added : ‘ this was a well - planned theft in which the suspects coldly and deliberately targeted the elderly couple			1
‘ not only did they follow them in the bank , but they also shadowed them as they carried out their shopping , waiting for the right time to pounce			0
’ he said the couple had withdrawn the money for @entity3 presents for their family and thankfully , ‘ in the spirit of the festive season ’ , @entity77 refunded the cash			1
‘ however , i will not rest until these despicable thieves are identified and brought to justice , ’ mr @entity59 added			0
‘ we have carried out numerous inquiries in the area and checked police systems to try and identify the suspects , but now we need the public ’s help to trace them			1
‘ i ’d also like to urge people to be on their guard against such tactics and if a stranger approaches you in the street , make sure you keep an eye on your belongings and report any suspicious activity to police			0
’ cynical : the gang had been following the couple since they withdrew the money from a cashpoint distraction : the ringleader then spoke to the pensioners claiming they had lost their way while the accomplice lurked behind kind : the couple politely turn round to face the man but doing so allow the other thief to sneak in and steal exit : as soon as the wallet was stolen the thieves fled and police are desperate to track them down distraction theft is not uncommon and it is believed these men may be travelling from town to town to evade police			1
in september , three thieves were captured on cctv using a similar technique – distracting a frail elderly man as he took money out of a cashpoint , and taking his bank cards and cash			1

she said thieves ‘ followed her into the @entity137 , watched her withdraw £ 800 and then distracted her while another member went down her shopping trolley and stole it ’			2
she added : ‘ the whole sorry incident was caught on @entity12 but all the police said was they were aware of the gang operating in our part of @entity146 and she has heard nothing from them since			0
’ on @entity53 , users described the thieves as ‘ disgusting ’ and ‘ vile scumbags ’			0
