drinking between two to four cups of coffee every day appears to reduce the risk of suicide in men and women by 50 per cent , according to a new study			1
researchers from the @entity8 reviewed data from three previous @entity11 studies and found the risk of suicide amongst adults who drank several cups of caffeinated coffee on a daily basis was about half that of that compared to those who drank decaffeinated coffee , very little coffee or no coffee at all			2
the study , of 200,000 men and women , examined data which outlined their caffeine consumption both coffee and non-coffee sources – including tea , caffeinated soft drinks , and chocolate			1
feel the buzz : those who drink two to four cups of coffee every day have a 50 per cent less suicide risk compared to those who drink decaffeinated coffee , little coffee or no coffee , according to new research however for the majority , coffee was the main caffeine source and over the average 6 and - a - half year assessment period , there were just 277 deaths from suicide			2
‘ unlike previous investigations , we were able to assess association of consumption of caffeinated and non-caffeinated beverages , and we identify caffeine as the most likely candidate of any putative protective effect of coffee , ' said lead researcher @entity58 , research fellow in the @entity59 at @entity8			1
caffeine works by stimulating the central nervous system but may act as a mild antidepressant by increasing production of certain ' feel good ' neurotransmitters in the brain , including serotonin , dopamine , and noradrenaline			0
this could explain why previous epidemiological studies have found a lower risk of depression among coffee drinkers in past , the researchers reported			0
in spite of the findings , the authors do not recommend that depressed adults self - medicate by increasing their caffeine consumption as an increase could result in unpleasant side effects			1
despite the findings , depressed adults are advised not to self - medicate by drinking more coffee than usual			2
a previous study found an increase in suicide amongst those who consumed more than eight cups a day ( posed by model ) ‘ overall , our results suggest that there is little further benefit for consumption above two to three cups a day or 400 mg of caffeine a day , ’ the authors wrote			0
the researchers did n’t observe any major difference in risk between those who drank two to three cups of coffee per day and four or more cups a day , most likely due to the small number of suicide cases in these categories			0
however , in a previous @entity8 coffee - depression study , the investigators observed a maximal effect among those who drank four or more cups per day			1
in fact one previous large @entity110 study showed a higher risk of suicide among people drinking eight or nine cups per day			0
few participants in the two @entity8 studies drank such large amounts of coffee so the impact of six or more cups a day of coffee was not addressed in these two studies .			0

@entity8 study analysed caffeine consumption of 200,000 men and women
2 - 4 cups have most protective effect - over tea , chocolate and soft drinks
but researchers warn depressed people should *n't* use coffee to self - medicate
