by @entity0 published : 05:57 est , 27 november 2012 updated : 06:20 est , 27 november 2012 fiery end : the fossil , found in @entity3 , is thought to be that of a large two - horned rhino once common in the @entity7 region the skull of a young rhino that was ' cooked to death ' 9.2million years ago has been found preserved in volcanic rock in @entity3			1
the preserved skull , found in @entity3 , is thought to have belonged to a large two - horned rhino common in the eastern @entity7 region during that period			1
unusual features of the fossil suggest the animal was baked to death in a volcanic flow similar to that which hit @entity23 in @entity24			1
the rhino 's grisly end was near - instantaneous			2
' the body was baked under a temperature approximating 400 ° c , then dismembered within the pyroclastic flow , and the skull separated from body , ' researchers said			0
this was followed by severe dehydration in the extreme heat of the volcanic ash , the flow of which moved the skull about 30km north of the eruption site , where it was discovered			2
less than 2 per cent of @entity43 's fossils are preserved in volcanic rock making the new find extremely rare , according to researchers from the @entity46 in @entity47 who unearthed it			1
although other researchers have previously identified fossils of soft - bodied organisms preserved in volcanic ash , organic matter near an active volcanic eruption is usually quickly destroyed by the high temperatures , they said			1
lead researcher @entity58 of the @entity46 in @entity47 told @entity59 his team found none of the rest of the rhino during their fieldwork			0
' the articulated skull and mandible were found alone , and there were no other rhino bones in the surroundings , except for some rib fragments , potentially of rhino affinities , ' he said			2
preserved for eternity : the volcanic rocks where the rhino 's fossilised skull was found			1
unusual features of the fossil suggest the animal was baked to death in a volcanic flow similar to that which hit @entity23 in @entity24 the two - horned rhino , @entity83 , would have weighed between 3,300 and 4,400lb when alive , dr @entity58 said - about the same as a modern young white rhino			1
the animal was a young adult between 10 and 15 years old when it met its fiery end			1
dr @entity58 said the external surfaces of the specimen were ' unusual ' , describing how ' the bony surface was rough and corrugated all around the skull and mandible , and the dentine ( the internal component of the teeth ) was incredibly brittle , and even kind of ' corroded ' [ in ] places			0
' microscope examination of the remains revealed structural changes in the rhino 's bones and teeth that suggested it had been heated to the high temperatures of the volcanic flows			2
the cranium and mandibles of the rhino : microscope examination of the remains revealed structural changes in the rhino 's bones and teeth that suggested it had been heated to the high temperatures of the volcanic flows dramatic landscape : hot air balloons rise to the sky at sunrise in @entity120 , central @entity3			0
volcanic ash spread over millions of years then eroded produced the incredible scenery ' there was not a real volcano , but a caldera which spread huge amounts of volcanic ash over @entity128 , during millions of years , throughout the late @entity131 - @entity130 interval , ' dr @entity58 told @entity59			0
today the @entity133 caldera is inactive , but over millions of years it has spread thick layers of volcanic ash across the surrounding area , creating a mangnificent landscape that surely holds many more wonders			0
the find is described in a paper published in the open access journal @entity142			0
this map shows the location of the find in @entity3 's @entity147 region			0

preserved skull belonged to young adult two - horned rhino aged 10 to 15
fossil features suggest animal was baked to death in @entity23 - like eruption
less than 2 per cent of the @entity43 's fossils are found in volcanic rock
