close your eyes and imagine the numbers one to nine on a line			1
most people will see a horizontal line , with one on the left , and an orderly progression to nine on the right – a tendency known as the ' mental number line			1
' but the preference for counting from left to right is n't just a human trait - it 's also shared by newborn chicks			1
their findings suggest it is innate , with chicks appearing to use the line when presented with two different panels with markings on them depicting numbers			1
the researchers also note that the brain 's asymmetry could have played a role in shaping the mental number line long ago			1
during the study , researchers first familiarised chicks with the number five			1
scientists have suggested that golden orb - web spiders may be able to ' count '			0
the arachnids create ' prey larders ' of victims trapped in their webs and it appears that they are able to keep track of how many meals they have left			0
scientists observed that the spiders search for missing prey when it is taken from their webs			0
golden orb - web spiders ( @entity52 ) wait for prey to fly into their webs , but dead insects are sometimes stolen from their sticky nets by other spiders			0
researchers at the @entity58 controlled the number of prey items in the spiders ' ' larders ' by giving them mealworm larvae and taking them away again			1
they discovered that the arachnids search for them if they are removed from their web			0
dr @entity68 , who led the research , said : we can make a tentative conclusion that these spiders possess a sense of numerosity			2
' they then showed the chicks two different panels - one on the left and one on the right - that both depicted the same , smaller value two			0
the noticed the majority of chicks approached the panels to their left in search of a food reward			0
professor @entity89 and her colleagues then showed the chicks two identical panels , both depicting a larger value , eight			0
this time , they discovered that most of the chicks chose to investigate the panels to their right			0
the researchers repeated their experiment using eight as the small value , 32 as the large value , and 20 as the chicks ' new target value			2
after familiarising a group of chicks with the number 20 , they found that the majority of those chicks wandered to the left when presented with panels depicting the smaller value			2
most of the chicks gravitated to the right when the panels displayed the larger value			0
professor @entity89 claims the trait likely evolved millions of years ago , before human ancestors split from those of modern birds			1

researchers now plan to look at the mental number line in other creatures she says evolution could have led to brain asymmetry as it allowed animals to process information within a dominant hemisphere			1
researchers now plan to look at the mental number line in other creatures			1
professor @entity89 told the @entity134 @entity133 : ' i would not at all be surprised that the number spatial mapping is also found in other animals and in newborn infants			2
' we are now extending the investigation to the study of other animal species			2
the final aim is to identify the neural areas involved in the number processing			2
' previous research has found that seven - month - old infants prefer to count left - to - right , regardless of where they 're born , according to @entity149			0
that preference can change as children gain experience that changes right - to - left counting – for example , learning to read in a right - to - left writing system .			0

trait may have evolved before human ancestors split from those of birds
the @entity19 study suggests evolution could have led to brain asymmetry
this allowed animals to process numbers within a dominant hemisphere
researchers now plan to look at the mental number line in other creatures
