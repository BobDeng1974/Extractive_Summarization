@entity0 are in talks with former @entity3 goalkeeper @entity2			1
manager @entity4 has offered the 32 - year - old a chance to complete his rehabilitation from a knee injury and to work his way back to fitness with the club			1
@entity2 , a free agent , will have his recovery supervised by the @entity0 medical staff before training with the first team , as he bids to regain full fitness			1
@entity2 is a free agent after he did not renew his contract with @entity3 at the end of last season former @entity3 goalkeeper @entity2 , pictured in 2011 , is in talks with @entity0 over a move @entity2 played 535 games for @entity3 over 12 glorious years			1
here he is pictured lifting the @entity21 after @entity3 's 2009 triumph over @entity0 in the final in @entity24 @entity3 ( 2002 - 2014 ) appearances : 535 @entity26 ( 2010 - ) caps : 20 the free agent had been expected to join fierce rivals @entity30 but @entity31 this week indicated that deal was off amid suggestions @entity2 was not keen on a four day training stint prior to signing			1
@entity2 has been out for six months with knee ligament damage , an injury that scuppered a proposed move to @entity38			2
however , he is now fit again and looking for a club to suit his ambitions			0
@entity2 was at @entity0 's @entity41 yesterday along with his representatives and is keen to discuss all possibilities			2
for their part @entity0 want to see how he has recovered from his injury before committing to a contract and will assess his recovery before offering anything			2
@entity0 are in talks over a new contract for @entity51 but they want improved competition for the 23 - year - old @entity26 international and @entity2 certainly fits the bill having won an array of honours during a glittering career			1
meanwhile , @entity58 will continue his recovery from ankle ligament damage on friday			0
the 33 - year - old has been out since july but is due to play for @entity0 's @entity62 against @entity63 at @entity64			1
the @entity66 midfielder was an unused substitute for monday night 's 2 - 2 draw at @entity68 and was expected to be part of the squad to face @entity71 at @entity72 on sunday			2
the time for recovery between games means he will likely take his place on the bench once again rather than figure from the start against @entity81 's title chasers			0
@entity2 beats @entity82 to the ball during @entity3 's 3 - 1 triumph over @entity0 in the 2011 @entity21 final @entity2 has more appearances for @entity3 than any other goalkeeper @entity2 is pictured with his wife @entity88 , left , in 2013 , and and earlier this year in @entity89 the @entity91 goalkeeper lies on a stretcher after sustaining a serious knee injury in march of this year @entity0 striker @entity94 is anticipating an edgy contest between the two rivals			1
the @entity97 , who has come under criticism for his lacklustre performances of late , said : ' @entity71 have a very good team and we have a good team			0
but it 's always a bit more edgy and i like that			0
you can sense that as well with the fans because they are a bit more on top of it in games like this			0
so in every way it 's a game to look forward to			0
' there 's always a bit of a different feeling but it 's not that we 're less concentrated for other games but there 's a bit extra tension in a good way			0
you do n't really know what 's going to happen before the game because it can go both ways			0
' like our @entity0 facebook page .			2
