but orphaned kitten @entity4 has found an unlikely surrogate mother in grumpy bulldog @entity7			1
the two year - old dog is keeping a close eye on her tiny ginger charge - so much so she has even started producing milk to feed him			1
sleeping tight : @entity7 and @entity4 the kitten ( pictured ) have become inseparable			1
@entity7 even makes space for @entity4 when taking an afternoon nap an unlikely bond : the @entity18 pictured washing his best friend @entity4			1
the two are virtually inseperable their unlikely bond developed when @entity4 , who is just two weeks old , was found alone and abandoned in a church			2
he was handed in to @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27 , where trainee nurse @entity28 fell for him on the spot			0
@entity31 took him home and was amazed when her pet dog @entity7 , who is unable to have pups herself because of a tumour on her spine , adopted the role of surrogate mum			1
@entity31 , 37 , who has three sons , said : ' from the moment i took @entity4 back to mine @entity7 completely tried to take over the care of him			1
like cat and dog : @entity7 and orphaned @entity4 spend most of their time together			2
@entity4 , who is just two weeks old , was found alone and abandoned in a church ' she washes him and lets him cuddle up , and now she ’s producing milk and feeding him			1
' she can be quite a moody so - and - so and i never thought she would be this way with him			0
' whenever @entity7 is around @entity4 buries himself into her flaps of skin to keep warm			2
@entity28 , who works for @entity25 in the @entity56 , fell for @entity4 on the spot			0
pictured here with the kitten and bulldog @entity7 in return her new mum stands in the way of curious approaches from @entity31 ’s other dogs - a male mastiff called @entity67 and @entity68 , a female @entity69 shepherd			1
@entity67 , however , is also getting parental and has started giving @entity4 a protective lick to keep him clean			2
@entity31 added : ' @entity67 has given him a few baths , but even then @entity7 will stand very close			0
' @entity67 sort of acts like a father towards @entity4 , so i ’m pretty sure that kitten will grow up rather confused			0
' @entity68 meanwhile ca n’t get anywhere near @entity4 at all			1
' @entity7 and @entity4 are set to keep their bond for life , even after @entity4 leaves for a new home			2
@entity31 ’s parents @entity79 and @entity81 have agreed to take him in			0
they live right next door			0
she said : ' we thought it would be too distressing to separate them completely and my boys were quite taken and did n’t want to lose him either			0
' they are thrilled nan and granddad have decided to take him in			0
