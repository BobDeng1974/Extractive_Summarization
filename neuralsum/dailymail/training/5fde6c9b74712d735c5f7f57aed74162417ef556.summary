@entity0 was back at his desk with a throbbing head and little recollection of the night before			1
this , however , is no tale of drunken debauchery			0
rather , the 15 - year - old had just written his name in @entity9 ’s history books as their youngest reserve - team scorer and his @entity12 - daft pals at @entity13 – former home of @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 - wanted to hear all about it			1
@entity0 , though , had been knocked unconscious shortly after his record - breaking goal on a bruising night against @entity21 at @entity23 ’s @entity22 and , even to this day , his memory is sketchy			1
@entity0 ( right ) in action for @entity25 against @entity26 in the @entity28 fourth round the 23 - year - old is on top of the world as he celebrates the @entity33 's side result against @entity26 but the schoolboy had announced his arrival and big things were expected			1
there was an @entity39 call - up and , by the following summer , @entity40 handed the teenager his debut in @entity43			2
he shared an agent with @entity45 and went with @entity9 ’s record goalscorer to a book - signing session at a @entity49 superstore – it all amounted to @entity0 being touted as @entity26 ’s next superstar			1
but his is a typical tale of one hyped so young and , after failing to make the grade on @entity53 , he dropped out of the @entity56			0
where his tale differs from the majority , however , is that @entity0 ’s career is again on the rise			0
on tuesday night , having been man - of - the - match during @entity64 ’s shock goalless draw with @entity26 in last month ’s @entity65 , he is aiming to give @entity66 the headache			1
for the 23 - year - old – who has scored three times at @entity71 for the @entity73 ’s - it is another taste of the stage he craves			1
‘ the first game was incredible			0
they ’ve been criticised and we think they got a rollicking at half - time , but honestly , they ’re so good , ’ @entity0 told @entity76			2
‘ but we did so well and got what we deserved			0
for me , to get man - of - the - match was brilliant			1
@entity0 says @entity86 ( centre ) has agreed to give him his shirt after the @entity28 replay the former @entity9 midfielder ( right ) vies for the ball with @entity93 's @entity92 in april 2012 @entity0 in action for @entity9 in the @entity95 semi-final against @entity97 in 2007 @entity98 2001 : @entity26 0 - 1 @entity99 @entity101 goal gives @entity99 first win at @entity103 since 1986			1
@entity104 2005 : @entity26 0 - 0 @entity105 superb defensive performance earns @entity107 a replay			1
quarter - final 2008 : @entity26 0 - 1 @entity110 @entity112 ’s penalty seals it for @entity114 ’s side , who win the @entity28			1
@entity116 2010 : @entity26 0 - 1 @entity117 @entity118 @entity117 stun old rivals thanks to @entity121 ’s goal			1
@entity116 2014 : @entity26 1 - 2 @entity122 @entity124 ’s @entity26 crash out to @entity126 ’s last - minute winner			0
‘ i hear @entity45 ( @entity45 ) spoke really well about me at half - time and i think that bumped the vote up – us @entity9 have got to stick together			2
‘ but we were a bit gutted over the next couple of days because we thought we were going to be the headline act – then @entity135 go and win at @entity136			1
but we ’re dreaming of doing a @entity135 now , it just shows what can happen with a bit of discipline and belief and we ’re not just going for the occasion			2
‘ although @entity86 has promised me his shirt – i hope he does n’t want mine because we ’re running low and need to pay £ 40 to replace them if we do swap ! ’ what about @entity0 ? given that he shared an @entity39 under - 17 dressing - room with @entity26 ’s @entity147 and @entity93 ’s @entity148 – and scored 10 goals from 15 appearances for the @entity151 - why is n’t he lining up on tuesday night in red as opposed to yellow ? after his release from @entity9 in 2012 , the midfielder moved south of the @entity156 to @entity157			1
he then followed former @entity9 academy boss @entity158 to @entity25 and netted twice in last season ’s @entity160 victory before getting the winner in the @entity163 against former club @entity157			1
he reflects : ‘ i do n’t think all of the hype helps when you get tagged as the next such and such			0
i was just a schoolkid loving playing for my hometown club			0
‘ when i got released i ’d been there 12 years and it was difficult , but it was a bit of a relief at the same time and i admit i was n’t good enough			0
@entity173 ( left ) was handed his @entity9 debut by @entity40 in a pre-season friendly against @entity43 the midfielder ( right ) in action for the @entity12 against @entity178 in the @entity180 second round in 2010 ‘ but when players get released too many drop out of the game – they lose hope and think their chance has gone			2
‘ for me , when you ’re in those @entity39 squads , everyone builds you up			0
but in reality , only a few make it at the very top			0
‘ others have to drop down and rebuild their career , i ’m one of those players			0
’ @entity0 is taking small steps			2
for example , he prefers to share a house with four of his team - mates - @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 and @entity203			0
it is all a far cry from the million - pound @entity206 mansions in which their @entity28 opponents reside			0
before the first game , @entity208 paid the boys a visit			0
@entity0 is relishing taking on @entity66 's side again in the @entity28 on tuesday night ‘ it was a bit scary standing having a coffee with him in the kitchen , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he was making a documentary and probably thought it was a bit strange all of us living together , but it works for us			0
‘ we all get on well – there ’s the odd argument over dishes or making the tea or playing darts , but i find living with the lads helps , especially being so far from home			0
’ if @entity33 @entity25 do pull off an upset then perhaps @entity229 will suggest @entity231 , @entity232 and @entity86 buy a pad together			2
for @entity234 , another star - man showing and he might just land the move which gets him a place of his own .			2

@entity25 travel to @entity103 on tuesday night for their @entity28 fourth round replay
@entity0 is relishing taking on @entity66 's side again
the 23 - year - old was man - of - the - match in the 0 - 0 draw on *january* 23
@entity0 used to play for @entity9 before he was released in 2012
he also played in the same @entity39 under 17 side as @entity147 and @entity148 during his younger days
the youngster is dreaming of the @entity33 side *outdoing* the feat @entity135 *achieved* in beating @entity136 in the @entity28 fourth round
