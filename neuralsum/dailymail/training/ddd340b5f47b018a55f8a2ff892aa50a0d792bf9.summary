by @entity0 published : 12:26 est , 6 january 2014 updated : 03:58 est , 7 january 2014 the @entity3 women ’s minister @entity2 was ridiculed yesterday for suggesting that mothers should be allowed to bring their babies into the @entity6			1
respected @entity8 newsreader @entity7 , who is also a working mother , said allowing mps to bring their ‘ bawling ’ babies to @entity11 would not ‘ greatly advance the feminist cause ’			1
in a scathing article entitled ‘ has this mp gone gaga ? ’ , miss @entity7 suggested bringing a baby into any office , let alone @entity11 , would distract women from the demands of their work because being a mother is a full - time job in itself			2
channel 4 news presenter @entity7 ( left ) warned @entity3 minister @entity2 was not advancing the cause of feminism by complaining about not being able to take her baby to a place of work ‘ juggling life and work is hard enough without having a baby in the office competing with your boss for your time and attention , ’ miss @entity7 wrote			1
miss @entity2 , 33 , who is also a business minister , gave birth to her first child , @entity36 , just before @entity37			1
she is married to @entity3 mp @entity38			1
an mp who is breastfeeding may bring a baby into her own office , but not into the @entity6 or @entity42 chambers , or the division lobbies they pass through to vote			1
miss @entity2 said : ‘ i hardly think it would be too much of a disruption			0
you can take a sword through there but you ca n’t a baby			0
’ miss @entity7 , who is married with two children , said while she understood the minister wanted to ‘ bang the drum for working mums ’ , her policy of ‘ carting ’ babies around the workplace was ill - judged			1
‘ do n’t get me wrong , i ’m all for mums being encouraged to breastfeed , though too many are made to feel terribly guilty if they ca n’t make it work , ’ she wrote in a @entity58 blog			0
‘ i ’m afraid , though , that it does n’t greatly advance the feminist cause to allow mps to cart their bawling babies through the lobby			0
the @entity65 is a workplace unlike any other , but a workplace nevertheless			2
family values : @entity2 , here pictured with husband , fellow @entity3 mp @entity38 , and baby @entity36 ‘ in my view , women should be able to breastfeed anywhere they need to , but i draw the line at looking after a baby – itself a full - time job – when you ’re at work			1
’ @entity81 mp sir @entity80 also weighed into the debate , saying miss @entity2 ’s suggestion was ‘ wholly inappropriate ’			2
the former defence minister , and father of three , said : ‘ the voting lobbies of the @entity6 are not a crèche			0
‘ of course mothers will want to look after their young children but i do n’t see the child ’s welfare is served by taking them through the lobbies			0
’ miss @entity7 , 39 , who used to be a political correspondent for @entity8 , conceded that @entity11 still had some way to go in becoming more family - friendly			0
the answer , she said , was for politicians to deliver ‘ more flexible , more affordable childcare ’ , such as a nanny , childminder or nursery			0
‘ so i ’m hoping that when ms @entity2 returns to work , she ’ll have found loving , reasonably priced care for baby @entity36 , leaving her free to focus on the tough demands of her day job , ’ she said			2
not in @entity106 : @entity109 mep @entity108 's tiny baby sleeps peacefully in a sling tied round her mother 's shoulders at the @entity11			0

*journalist* @entity7 said the @entity65 is a workplace like any other
@entity3 business minister @entity2 slammed ' guilt *culture* ' for mothers
mps can take babies to their office but the @entity65 or @entity42 chambers
wife of @entity3 mp @entity38 gave birth to @entity36 before @entity37
