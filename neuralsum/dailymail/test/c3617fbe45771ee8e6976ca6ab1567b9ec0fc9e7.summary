separate figures today showed that factory output slowed to its weakest level in more than two years in the three months to april , held back by sluggish export orders			1

however , economists had forecast a bigger rise			2

campaigning in the @entity75 , he said : ' we 'll introduce law to ensure no one working 30 hours on the @entity78 pays any @entity79 at all , benefiting over 2.5million people in the @entity75			2

@entity89 leader @entity88 today cast the conservatives as the party of ' the small businesses , the entrepreneurs , the techies , the roof tilers , the retailers , the plumbers , the builders ' and said a @entity89 government would continue delivering the ' pro-business environment ' which small companies want , which would be at risk if @entity104 wins on may 7			2
unveiling the @entity8 ' small business manifesto in @entity106 , mr @entity88 warned : ' @entity17 think they know how to spend your money better than you do			2
they will put up your taxes			2

they will put up your regulations			0
' you know what they call you ? they say business is a predator			0
this is not some @entity122 movie			0
this is what we are staring down the barrel of in 10 days ' time if we do n't get out there and fight for jobs and fight for enterprise and fight for our economy , and that 's what we are going to do			0
' he added : " if you think i 'm going to roll over in the next 10 days and let @entity104 and @entity138 wreck that , you 've got another think coming			0
we have got a fight on our hands and i am going to win that fight			0
it 's a battle for the backbone of @entity12 , that 's what this election is about			0

@entity169 's @entity168 said he was pessimistic on growth , expecting it to decelerate to 0.4 per cent for the first quarter , adding that he ' would n't rule out an even lower number '			1
but he said the second quarter should be much stronger			1
@entity175 of @entity176 said : ' the first estimate of gdp seems likely to show that the recovery slowed in @entity180 and may therefore put the coalition parties on the back foot just nine days before the @entity183			1
' nonetheless , we doubt that the recovery is on the cusp of a slowdown			0
households ' incomes are on track for their strongest growth since 2006 this year			1
' meanwhile , borrowing costs are falling and monetary stimulus appears to have revived the eurozone economy			0
' @entity195 of @entity196 said he expected a slowdown to 0.5 % , saying it would be ' very unwelcome ' for coalition parties ' hoping that many undecided voters will ultimately decide to vote for them due to their management of the economy '			1
' however , we believe growth prospects are still decent for the @entity12 economy as long as there is not prolonged political uncertainty following the @entity183			1
' the fundamentals look particularly promising for consumer spending			0

' a new survey by @entity219 had the @entity8 on 36 per cent , with @entity17 trailing on 30 per cent , @entity220 on 11 per cent and the @entity221 on 9 per cent the @entity8 could be six points ahead of @entity17 , or three points behind , depending on which opinion poll to believe			0
