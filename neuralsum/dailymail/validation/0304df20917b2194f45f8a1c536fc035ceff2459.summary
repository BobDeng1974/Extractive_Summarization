militants fighting for the @entity1 in @entity2 and @entity3 have issued a new set of rules jihadis must live by - including restrictions on when to utter curses and a ban on women slapping their thighs			1

providing a unique glimpse in to life under @entity24 ' brutal and oppressive control , each of the 32 slips of paper - which are headed with the terror group 's chilling black and white logo - gives a detailed explanation of various bizarre rules and regulations laid out by @entity24 leader @entity33			2
among the more unusual commands are orders that men must refrain from swearing while playing billiards or table football , and information on exactly when it is permitted for women dye their eyebrows blonde or carry assault rifles beneath their niqabs			1
militants : a fighter calling himself @entity13 , who claims to be based in the terrorists ' capital @entity16 ( pictured ) , tweeted photographs of flyers containing fatwas imposed on local residents in recent weeks @entity50 : each of the 32 slips of paper - which are headed with the terror group 's chilling black and white logo - gives a detailed explanation of various bizarre rules and regulations laid out by @entity24 each of the 32 paper fatwas seen in @entity60 's tweets last month are numbered and dated , and are written in @entity61			1
it is understood the 32 fatwas are taken from approximately 70 new rules and regulations issued by the @entity1 in 2015			2
the letters are written in @entity61 and address the city 's population , which terror analysis website @entity69 claims proves they are meant for local use , not wider propaganda purposes			0
the fatwas are unlikely to have been issued by any body other than @entity24 ' official @entity75 , to whom even leader @entity33 reports			2
@entity69 claims that this means 30 - year - old @entity80 scholar and council leader @entity81 is the likely author			0
@entity60 's tweets show that the list of new rules have been issued in a kind of stapled book and are structured in a question and answer format			0
although they pieces of paper are dated using an official @entity1 calender , @entity89 converted the dates to show that they were issued to citizens between december and february this year			2
oppressed : among the more unusual legal explantions is information on exactly when it is permitted for women living under @entity24 to dye their eyebrows blonde or carry assault rifles beneath their niqabs horror : at times the fatwas make harrowing reading , such as the rule justifying jihadis burning ' unbelievers ' to death because the @entity108 ordered his enemies ' eyes to be gouged out with hot iron the fatwas issued by the @entity1 are highly bureaucratic , demanding fighters hand over one fifth of all money and items looted to the terror group 's officials , insisting fighters can not leave territory under @entity24 control under any circumstances , and banning women from showing their eyes			1
at times they make for harrowing reading , such as the rule justifying jihadis burning ' unbelievers ' to death because the @entity108 ordered his enemies ' eyes to be gouged out with hot irons			1
the bulk of the fatwas deal with administrative matters , such as when citizens are due compensation , how women should ensure they are dressed , and explaining the incredibly strict terms and conditions under which seriously ill women can visit a male doctor			1
despite rumours to the contrary having circulated for many months , they fatwas clearly state that the issuing of @entity1 passports is banned as they enable citizens to ' travel to the lands of disbelief ' - something expressly forbidden in an earlier dictat			1
on a lighter note , both billiards and table football are allowed - albeit under strict conditions and with a warning that @entity158 does not look particularity favourably on such trivial pursuits			1
gambling on matches is , predictably , banned , but so is using table football characters shaped like humans , as the creation of anything imitating humans or animals is banned under @entity24 ' exceptionally strict interpretation of islamic law			1
fatwa 35 : december 11 , 2014 one fifth of all war booty it is to be given to the office of war booty			0
fatwa 36 : december 11 , 2014 tax should be levied on agricultural holdings that once belonged to apostates			0
fatwa 37 : december 16 , 2014 it is not permissible to travel to the lands of the unbelievers - including areas controlled by the @entity186 regime			0
fatwa 38 : december 2 , 2014 it permissible to curse by accusing someone of being a disbeliever , but you must never say they are destined for hellfire			0
fatwa 40 : december 17 , 2014 women should not wear make - up or show any part of their face , including their eyes , in case lures men into temptation			2
fatwa 41 : december 17 , 2014 women can carry weapons such as @entity207 rifles under their robes providing they do not add definition to her body , luring men into temptation			1
fatwa 42 : december 17 , 2014 female nurses must not work in an office with a male doctor unless they have a male guardian			1
fatwa 43 : december 17 , 2014 women must see only female doctors for treatment			0
if a female doctor can not be found , then it is permissible to see a male doctor , but on the condition that he not be alone with her			1
fatwa 44 : december 17 , 2014 women must cover their entire body in thick , loose fitting material that does not resemble the clothing of men or that of women in the @entity235			0
they must not slap their thighs or act flirtatiously as it is highly arousing , nor can they wear perfume			0
fatwa 45 : december 17 , 2014 a woman must travel with a male guardian at all times fatwa 46 : december 17 , 2014 women whose husbands have been killed must be punished if they try to leave @entity24 - held territory for the lands of the unbelievers			1
fatwa 47 : december 18 , 2014 the length of time between the call to prayer and the call just before prayer must vary from prayer to prayer , according to the sunnah			0
fatwa 48 : december 20 , 2014 you must not sell @entity1 passports to allow citizens to travel to the land of unbelievers			1
fatwa 49 : december 28 , 2014 it is permissible to play billiards providing the game does not allow gambling , encourage cursing , or inhibit the worshiping or @entity158 fatwah 50 : december 28 , 2014 it is permissible to play foosball [ table football ] providing the game does not allow gambling , encourage cursing , feature characters in human or animal form , or inhibit the worshiping or @entity158			1
brutal : the bulk of the fatwas deal with administrative matters , such as how women should dress and explaining the incredibly strict terms and conditions under which seriously ill women can visit a male doctor fatwa : despite rumours to the contrary having circulated for many months , they fatwas clearly state that the issuing of @entity1 passports is banned as they enable citizens to ' travel to the lands of disbelief ' one chilling fatwa appears to confirm reports that @entity24 operates an organ harvesting scheme			1
' it is permissible to transplant the healthy organs of the body of an apostate to the body of a muslim , in order to save the latter 's life or improve his condition if he has lost organs , ' the letter states ' the jurists of the @entity321 and @entity322 schools of @entity324 law , among others , permitted killing belligerent unbelievers or apostates and eating their flesh as a life - saving measure			1
the case of organ transplantation as a life - saving measure is similar , ' it adds			0
' moreover , it is established that the lives and organs of apostates are fundamentally licit			0
their organs may thus be taken , whether or not the apostates are alive or already dead , and whether or not doing so results in their death , ' it goes on to claim			2
@entity207 assault rifles , one fatwa insists , are perfectly acceptable to be carried beneath a women 's clothes , providing it does n't add definition to her body that could be deemed tempting to men			1
likewise all forms of @entity355 clothing are banned in order not to ' imitate the unbeliever ' , although the fatwas still feel the need to say it is illegal to sell counterfeit brand - name clothing and household products , as selling fake produce is a form of deceit			0
one surprising law bans the practice of men swapping sisters or daughters for brides of their own , apparently because it ' does an injustice to the bride '			0
instead , @entity24 demand , the bride must grant permission for any marriage to take place			2
the @entity1 cherry picks sections of the @entity382 and misinterprets the accounts of the @entity108 in order to wage jihad and sign up new recruits , experts say			2
it is estimated that 20,000 people have streamed into the territory in @entity3 and @entity2 , where @entity24 has proclaimed what it calls a ' caliphate ' , ruled by its often brutal version of @entity324 law			1
the group purport to recreate the conquests and rule of the @entity108 and his successors and maintains its worst brutalities - such as beheading captives - only prove its purity in following what it contends is the prophet 's example			0
but now @entity405 clerics and other experts are speaking out , saying that the group hand picks what it wants from @entity324 's holy book , the @entity382 , and from accounts of @entity108 's actions and sayings , known as the @entity413			0
an @entity24 member parades through the streets of @entity16 in @entity2 waving an @entity1 flag and brandishing a gun			1
experts have now said that @entity24 misinterprets the @entity382 in order to wage jihad it then misinterprets many of these , while ignoring everything in the texts that contradicts those hand - picked selections			0
writings by the group 's clerics and its @entity429 online magazine , @entity428 , are full of citations from @entity382 verses , the @entity413 and centuries of interpreters , mostly from hardliners			0
but @entity435 , an assistant professor of @entity437 at @entity438 in the @entity439 , says these are taken far out of context by @entity24			0
he explained that @entity324 scholars throughout history have used texts in a ' decontextualised way ' to suit their purposes and says that @entity24 represent the extreme			2
he added : ' it would be a mistake to conclude the @entity427 's extremism is the true islam that emerges from the @entity382 and @entity413 .			0
