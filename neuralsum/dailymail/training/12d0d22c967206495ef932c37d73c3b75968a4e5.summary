@entity1 , an only child , said he is devastated having always been very close to his mother @entity12 , 54 , a dental receptionist			2
he said : ' my mum means the world to me and i love her to the moon and back			0
' my mum is my best friend , i 'm devastated			0
' i did n't really know anything about leukaemia at all , i thought it was a cancer only children could get - now everything 's just turned upside down for me			2
' it 's just so much to take in but i 'm spending every day at the hospital with mum , and i 'm learning as we go			2
' i now know that for people who need a transplant , it 's usually their last chance			2
' the devastating news came in the last few weeks , just a month ago the fashion designer and his mother had no reason to suspect there was anything wrong			0
' i was filming for @entity2 and everything was as normal , ' said @entity1 , who joined the cast in 2012			2
' @entity44 seemed herself and was physically doing everything she has always done on a daily basis , like walking to work and back , keeping the house in order and dog - sitting for my dog @entity52			0
' a few weeks ago she started feeling a bit run down and tired , but other than that things were still really normal			0
' after complaining of feeling lethargic ms @entity55 went to see her doctor			1
blood tests revealed she had a form of blood cancer called acute myeloid leukaemia			1
ms @entity55 , 54 , pictured with @entity1 as a child , went to the doctors a few weeks ago , complaining of feeling lethargic			1
tests revealed she had fallen victim to the blood cancer @entity1 , an only child , said he is devastated at his mother 's diagnosis			1
the 54 - year - old is currently in hospital and is receiving intensive chemotherapy twice a day to try and treat the disease doctors told @entity1 and his family last week that his mother 's best hope is a bone marrow transplant to try and treat the disease ' @entity44 was rushed to hospital that very same day , and has n't been allowed home since , ' @entity1 said			1
' we 're being brave for each other			0
i know she does n't want me to see her upset or scared and vice versa			0
' so we 're both keeping strong for each other when i visit , but as soon as i get outside the hospital and into the car park , that 's when i 'm breaking down in tears			0
' ms @entity55 has been receiving intense chemotherapy twice a day , but doctors told the family last week that the treatment alone would not be enough to cure her of the disease			1
' my mum is my best friend , i 'm devastated ' - @entity95 ' we were told that mum has a gene that will prevent the chemotherapy working to its full potential , ' said @entity1			2
' her best hope of survival now is a bone marrow transplant			1
' i ’m an only child and my mum had lost contact with her brother			0
' but we have recently managed to track him down to arrange a test to see if he is a potential match for mum , but siblings are n't always guaranteed matches – the vast majority of people have to rely on finding an unrelated donor			0
' so it ’s now a waiting game to see if we can find a stranger on the @entity119 bone marrow register who is a match for mum and who is willing to donate their stem cells to her			1
' it could literally be anyone – i recently found myself passing strangers at @entity129 or traffic lights , and thinking , you could be a match for my mum or somebody else suffering from this terrible disease			0
' @entity1 appeared on @entity136 's @entity135 to urge people to sign up to the @entity119 bone marrow register in a bid to help find a donor for his mother the 27 - year - old fashion designer said : ' my mum is my best friend , i 'm devastated ' @entity1 , left , dressed up for a @entity143 themed party for an episode of @entity2 @entity1 is now lending his support to blood cancer charity @entity119 , which runs the @entity149 bone marrow register and is marking its fortieth anniversary this week			1

' i know i ’m not the only one this is happening to , ' he said			0
' there are other families being told the same news every single day – today , this evening , tomorrow			0
' two thirds of them will rely on @entity119 to find them their lifesaving donor			2
' a stranger to one person is another person 's mum ... these donors are lifesavers and i 'm bowled over by the kindness of strangers who do this ' - @entity95 ' i feel completely helpless right now , but all i can do apart from being there for mum is to try to raise awareness of the @entity119 register , particularly to young people who are much more likely to go on to donate and save a life			1
' @entity1 is now backing an @entity119 campaign which launched this week , calling on people to ‘ save a stranger ’s life ’			1

' a stranger to one person is another person ’s mum , ' @entity1 said			0
' for the donor , it ’s probably just a case of sitting still for a few hours while the stem cells are taken out of their blood			0
' but for me , and for families like mine , it ’s the difference between having my mum around or not			0
these donors are lifesavers and i ’m bowled over by the kindness of strangers who do this			0

@entity234 , @entity235 at @entity119 said : ' we ca n’t thank @entity1 enough for helping to spread the word about donating stem cells , particularly at such a difficult time for his family			2
' there are still many misconceptions out there about what ’s involved			0
' for example , most people do n’t know that nine times out of ten , the process is very similar to giving blood , and joining the register just involves spitting into a tube			2
' @entity1 is also absolutely right that we urgently need young people to come forward and join the register , particularly men aged 16 to 30 as they ’re currently underrepresented			2
' any one of @entity1 ’s fans who he inspires to join the register , could one day save a life - but unless they sign up , they ’ll never have this chance			1
