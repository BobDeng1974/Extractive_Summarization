according to police official @entity22 , @entity2 left his guesthouse early tuesday on a motorcycle taxi and never returned			2
his body was discovered wednesday , and no suspects have been apprehended yet , he said			0
earlier this week , @entity2 â€™s estranged @entity34 wife has revealed that the teacher had told her of his fear that ' someone was after him ' shortly before he disappeared			1
@entity38 , 44 , said in a phone call from @entity40 that her husband was living in fear shortly before his death			1
she told the @entity44 : ' he called me many times and said that some @entity7 people wanted something from him			2
' he was afraid and wanted to leave quickly			0
' the woman said she had suggested her estranged husband relocate to @entity51 and even offered to pay for his plane ticket			2
mrs @entity38 said the last time they spoke was on monday - three days before his body was found			1
she claimed that her husband had a drinking problem and could sometimes be aggressive , but the problems had never been severe enough during their marriage to get him into serious trouble			0
' ' yes , we had marital problems like many people and he sometimes got into fights when he was drunk			0
' but i do n't understand that in five years in @entity40 it was always sorted out - yet in two months in @entity7 he is murdered			1
' the murder of mr @entity2 - who is believed by detectives to have been strangled to death - has sparked lengthy debates on expatriate forums in @entity7 , with numerous conspiracy theories being put forward for his murder			1

his former colleagues are said to have based their beliefs on what @entity2 had told them about the life he left behind in @entity34 , although no details about this have emerged publicly			0
