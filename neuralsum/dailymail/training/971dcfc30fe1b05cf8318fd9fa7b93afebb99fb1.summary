inflation is today set to drop below 1 per cent for the first time since june 2002 on the back of the falling price of food and fuel			0
the figures for december , to be published at 9.30am , will be hailed by ministers as evidence that the squeeze on family finances is finally coming to an end , with wages rising faster than prices			0
the fall in inflation will fuel speculation that interest rates could stay at 0.5 per cent until late this year or even until next year in a boost for millions of borrowers			1
so this week he will be forced to explain why the figure is so low – paving the way for interest rates to stay at rock bottom for longer than expected			1
@entity35 , chief @entity36 economist at @entity37 , said : ‘ inflation is likely to have been brought down further in december primarily by a marked fall in petrol prices … the ongoing supermarket pricing war should have continued to limit prices			1
’ he added : ‘ with oil prices hitting new lows in january and likely to remain weak for a prolonged period and with the supermarket pricing war continuing , inflation could very well get down near to 0.5 per cent in the early months of 2015			0

@entity83 , savings expert at @entity84 , said : ‘ you might have better luck picking the winner of the @entity88 than you would predicting when interest rates might change			2
‘ the @entity22 seems content to hunker down and sit on interest rates , possibly until later this year or even early 2016			1
’ @entity91 , chief economist at @entity92 , said : ‘ expectations about an early hike in interest rates by the @entity22 have cooled			1
@entity36 policymakers will be in no hurry to start raising interest rates			2
