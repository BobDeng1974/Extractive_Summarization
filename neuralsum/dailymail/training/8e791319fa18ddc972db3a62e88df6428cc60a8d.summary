as their fake orange tans shimmer and the thousands of sequins on their expensive , garishly - coloured costumes sparkle under the bright lights , it could be a @entity18 show			2
but it is in fact the surreal world of under 10 freestyle disco dancing where girls as young as four and their mums go to huge lengths to achieve glory in this fiercely competitive environment			1
@entity28 for video dressed up : parents spend thousands on their daughters to ensure they wear the glitziest costumes possible complete with sequins and hair fasteners tiring : @entity35 collapses to the floor with exhaustion after giving her all in a disco dancing performance in scenes some may find uncomfortable the frenzied crowd whoops and hollers as the gaggle of heavily made up petite dancers push their bodies to the limits as they flip and leap around the dance floor of the famous @entity47			1
the child dance scene has been highlighted in a @entity50 documentary which chronicles the journey of four nine - year - old girls as they battle through a series of heats to try and achieve their dream			1
it reveals the girls ' rigorous training schedule which involves contorting their small frames into near - impossible positions and performing unbelievable feats of flexibility , stamina and strength for more than six hours a day			2
such is the effort put in by the girls in the documentary that one is shown to collapse in a competition and another appears to be in serious physical discomfort as she takes drags from an asthma inhaler			2
balanced : @entity73 contorts her body into a near impossible position as she trains for the final of the @entity10 competition painful : a young girl lets out a little scream of pain as she is pushed from behind by reigning @entity10 champ cara take - off : one of the girls leaps in the air as she takes part in a heat en route to reach the final freestyle disco was invented just 23 years ago and is the fastest and most furious form of competitive @entity93 costumes are as vivid and flamboyant as possible and the moves push the dancers to their physical @entity96 are held in places as varied as scout huts and nightclub @entity99 as young as four are taking part in the sport which involves performing ever more athletic and flexible maneouvres			1
a small girl who faces a wall with her legs spread wide apart lets out a scream of anguish as current @entity11 under 10 champion @entity35 pushes from behind to try and stretch her a little more			0
dancing teacher @entity110 is shown giving a brutal assessment of the exhausted young girls ' efforts			1
' lazy , lazy , lazy ' she says pointing at three different children			2
the demands of the sport mean the competitors pick up injuries on the path to the top , but for the mums kidney infections , swollen ankles and twisted pelvises will not stop their little prodigies from practicing			0
@entity126 , mother of @entity128 champion @entity127 , nine , says her daughter regularly gets ill in the run up to competitions			1
' i took her to the doctor 's and they kept saying that it was stress - related and i was going to them ' but she 's nine , how can she possibly be stressed ? ' they kept saying that before a child has a competition of any sort it is like an athlete and their adrenalin gets a lot faster than it normally is			1
' stretched : nine - year - old @entity146 executes a handstand as part of her freestyle disco routine at the @entity47 tiny dancer : a young competitor crawls on the floor in her tiger skin leotard complete with feathers startled : @entity127 's mum @entity126 puts her make up on			1
@entity126 says : ' the more make up , the bigger the hair the bigger the diamonds on the costumes , the more you stand out ' preparing for the big day is not just about the dancing it 's all about the costume as well			1
wigs , feather bowers , false eyelashes and piles of make - up are all tools of the trade for the young dancing queens			1
one scene shows @entity35 from @entity172 getting a fake tan in a professional studio ahead of her performance			0
talking about her own attitude to outfits @entity126 adds : ' i personally believe in the bigger the better			0
the more the diamonds on the costumes , the more you stand out			0
' ' the judges are going to look at you first and they are obviously going to watch you dance then			0
' the show also highlights the emotional strain the girls suffer in their battle to be the best and they are shown to break down in tears when their high - octane performances do n't achieve the desired result			1
upset : @entity127 's mum @entity126 tries to reattach her daughter 's wig which has fallen off during a competition dancing queen : @entity35 ( pictured top middle ) from @entity172 is crowned the @entity11 @entity10 at the final in the @entity47 in @entity195			1
she is shown here with the other finalists preparing : @entity35 is given a spray tan at a professional salon ahead of competing the lengths to which parents will go to try and see their little girls win are also depicted in the hour - long documentary			2
@entity204 says has moved her daughter @entity146 from @entity206 to @entity172 so she can benefit from a top dance teacher			2
she adds : ' i just think it is magical			0
for any little girl it is a dream			0
when i was a little girl i played netball which is hardly glamorous			0
i do n't know maybe it is me going back to being a little girl			0
the programme has caused quite a stir online website for mums - mumsnet			0
one angered parent commented : ' the fake tan made me feel real uncomfortable			0
