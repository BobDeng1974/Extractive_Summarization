by @entity0 published : 11:58 est , 23 june 2012 updated : 12:03 est , 23 june 2012 @entity1 , the @entity3 codebreaker , may not have committed suicide @entity1 , the @entity3 codebreaker widely regarded as the father of modern computing , may not have committed suicide but died as a result of an accident , an academic has claimed			1
evidence gathered after the death of the scientist from cyanide poisoning at the age of 41 in 1954 was ' overlooked ' and he could have died as a result of inhaling the poison he used in amateur experiments rather than deliberately ingesting it , according to professor @entity22			1
professor @entity22 , director of the @entity24 for the @entity25 and author of a new biography of the academic , spoke as events took place around the country to celebrate the centenary of the under - appreciated scientific genius 's birth			1
' from the records i have been able to obtain , it seems to me very obvious that the inquest was conducted in a very superficial way , ' he said			0
' the coroner did n't really investigate the evidence at all , he just jumped to the conclusion that he committed suicide			0
' he seems to have been very biased from the statements in newspapers at the time			0
' the coroner in @entity1 's death case ruled he committed suicide ' while the balance of his mind was disturbed ' , adding : ' in a man of his type , one never knows what his mental processes are going to do next			1
' @entity1 , who was gay , was found guilty of gross indecency with another man in 1952			2
to avoid prison , he agreed to receive injections of oestrogen for a year , which were intended to reduce his libido in a process known as ' chemical castration			0
' @entity22 , a professor at the @entity64 in @entity65 , will talk about @entity1 's death at an event in @entity68 tonight			1
he said medical evidence suggested @entity1 died from inhaling cyanide rather than drinking or ingesting it			1
tribute : an animated representation of an @entity74 decoding machine appeared as the ' doodle ' on @entity77 's homepage , in honour of the computer scientist he said police reported a strong smell of cyanide coming from @entity1 's lab , where he used it in amateur experiments			1
he called for the inquest to be re-opened			0
' it would be a terrific thing to do			0
i think the nation owes it to @entity1 , in the @entity3 he saved the nation			1
' perhaps best known today for his part in breaking the @entity96 enigma code , @entity1 was by that time already established as a mathematician of extraordinary capability			1
during his time at @entity100 , @entity101 , he devised the @entity102 , a mathematical model that went on to become one of the cornerstones of computer science , aged just 22			0
@entity77 's homepage ' doodle ' is today an animated representation of an @entity74 decoding machine , in honour of the computer scientist			1
and he trended worldwide on @entity112 , with @entity113 , wife of former prime minister @entity114 , writing : ' happy 100th birthday @entity1			1
' former chess prodigy and world champion @entity116 will attend a conference on @entity1 in 2009 , mr @entity114 issued an apology for the treatment of @entity1 after he was found guilty of gross indecency with another man in 1952			2
mr @entity114 said at the time : ' the debt of gratitude he is owed makes it all the more horrifying , therefore , that he was treated so inhumanely			0
' today will see scientists and other @entity1 fans gather in @entity129 , @entity68 and @entity101 , among other places , to celebrate his work as part of @entity133			2
a spokeswoman for @entity133 , a campaign to celebrate his work during the whole of 2012 , said : ' @entity1 was godfather of computer science and ( an ) artificial intelligence pioneer , as well as someone who saved literally millions of lives through his codebreaking work			2
' plaques in his honour will be erected in @entity101 , @entity129 and at his childhood home , @entity145 in @entity146 in @entity147			0
dr @entity148 , from @entity101 's @entity149 , who regularly tours schools with an original enigma machine , said : ' in its purest form , mathematics is the search for truth , and @entity1 was one of the most important contributors to this search			1
it 's fantastic that his life is being celebrated			0
' former chess prodigy and world champion @entity116 is due to attend @entity129 's @entity162 on monday			0
a campaign led by @entity164 , conservative mp for @entity165 , is seeking an official pardon for @entity1 's conviction and there is also a campaign to have him appear on the next issue of the Â£ 10 note			2
the campaign on the @entity175 e-petition website , which had more than 17,500 signatories this afternoon , says : ' @entity1 is a national hero			2
' his contribution to computer science , and hence to the life of the nation and the world , is incalculable			0
the ripple - effect of his theories on modern life continues to grow , and may never stop			0

@entity1 could have died by inhaling poison he used in experiments rather than deliberately ingesting it , professor suggests
@entity1 played a *key* role in cracking the @entity96 enigma code during the @entity3
events take place across the @entity195 to mark the 100th *anniversary* of the mathematician 's birth
search giant @entity77 pays tribute by turning its homepage ' doodle ' into an animated turing machine
