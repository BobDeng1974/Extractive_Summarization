women are kicking the drink - drive habit more slowly than men , new research from the @entity1 reveals today			0
it said that while the likelihood of a male driver failing a breath test after an accident was falling steadily , the decline in female failure rates was only a third of that of men			1
the findings come as ministers launch a new hard - hitting drink - drive campaign to mark 50 years of @entity18 efforts to persuade motorists to avoid alcohol when getting behind the wheel			1
but the number of female drivers who failed a breath test after an accident in the same time period dropped by just 5.9 per cent ( 853 to 803 )			1
however , three times as many men fail a breath test after an accident than women - even though female drivers make up 46.5 per cent of full driving licence holders			1
@entity1 president @entity56 said : ‘ while women have a better track record on drink - driving than men , it is important to shine a spotlight on the fact their improvement rate has stalled in recent years , and in some age groups , regressed			2
pioneering : the first drink - drive campaign aired in november 1964 and followed events after an office party @entity68 : the first campaign came in the form of a public information film set in an office @entity72 - and assumed the driver would be a ' he ' easy to understand : this graphic showing the amount the man had to drink was also used in the 1964 advert ‘ part of this may be down to the fact women are more likely to be the designated drivers , but whatever the reason there is no excuse for drink - driving			1
’ to mark the 50th anniversary of drink - drive campaigns , the government ’s think ! initiative is launching a new hard - hitting advert which juxtaposes @entity29 's cheery 1980 celebration song with a dramatic crash scene and the sequence of events that follow , reminding people that there are still too many people being killed on the roads by drink - drivers			1
the first campaign in november 1964 came in the form of a public information film set in an office @entity72 - and assumed the driver would be a ' he '			1
desperate call : the 1980 also featured events stemming from someone driving after drinking at a party video nasty : the 1982 campaign was entitled ' @entity112 ' and starred actor @entity113 , who would go on to find fame in @entity115 as ' @entity117 ' @entity116 fifty years on from the first anti-drink - drive campaign , nearly all motorists would be ashamed to be caught over the limit , according to a survey			2
but 18 - 24 - year - olds are seven times more likely to think drinking and driving is acceptable than 55 - 64 - year - olds , the poll by the government 's think ! campaign showed			2
based on responses from 2,000 people , the think ! survey showed that 91 per cent agreed drink - driving was socially unacceptable and 92 % would feel ashamed if caught offending in this way			0
hard - hitting : the 1992 advert featured an injured woman with the slogan ' quick drink never hurt ' but 7 per cent of 18 to 24 - year - olds said drink - driving was acceptable compared with only 1 per cent of 55 to 64 - year - olds			2
older people were most likely to see drink - driving as socially unacceptable and would also be more likely to be ashamed by it , which suggests the public information campaigns over 50 years have reinforced this message			1
road deaths due to drink - driving have fallen from 1,640 in 1967 to 230 in 2012			0
in 1979 , more than half of male drivers admitted drinking and driving on a weekly basis , with the proportion rising to two thirds for young male drivers			2
new version : another scene from the new 2014 campaign , which features a woman injured in a crash shameful : fifty years on from the first anti-drink - drive campaign , nearly all motorists would be ashamed to be caught over the limit , according to the survey hitting home : the number of female drivers who failed a breath test after an accident between 2010 and 2013 dropped by just 5.9 per cent , compared with the number of men which fell by 17.6 per cent aim : the campaign aims to remind people that there are still too many being killed on the roads by drink - drivers danger : in 1979 , more than half of male drivers admitted drinking and driving on a weekly basis , with the proportion rising to two thirds for young male drivers statistics : road deaths due to drink - driving have fallen from 1,640 in 1967 to 230 in 2012 today more than 88 per cent of people say they would think badly of someone who drinks and drives and 45 per cent of respondents said they would prefer to tell their partner they watch pornography regularly than confess to being caught drink - driving			1
transport secretary @entity196 said : ‘ the change in attitudes to drink - driving over the last 50 years is a huge success story			1
‘ it is hard to imagine now how shocking and ground - breaking the first drink - drive campaigns were when they launched			0
clearly think ! has had a significant impact			0
‘ most of us understand drink - driving wrecks lives but there is further to go			0
in 2012 , 230 people were killed in drink - driving accidents - 230 too many			0
this makes the think ! campaign as relevant as ever			0
’ @entity1 president @entity56 said : ‘ fifty years of education has had a fantastic impact on changing the public 's perception of drink - driving , but there is more to do			0
’ perception : today more than 88 per cent of people say they would think badly of a drink - driver worrying : the poll found that 18 - 24 - year - olds are seven times more likely to think drinking and driving is acceptable than 55 - 64 - year - olds			0
