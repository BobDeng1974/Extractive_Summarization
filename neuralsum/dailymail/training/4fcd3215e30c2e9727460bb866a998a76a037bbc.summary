by @entity0 @entity1 may have mapped some of the most remote regions on @entity4 , but outer space remains a vast and dark mystery			0
now one @entity8 app , named @entity9 , is hoping to give space the ‘ @entity12 ’ treatment by plotting cosmic events in real - time for amateur astronomers			1
using raw data from @entity18 , the app displays events such as supernovas and comets , on a @entity12 interface and highlights them as they happen			1
the @entity29 - based team came up with the app during @entity18 ’s @entity31 and is currently working on a prototype			1
an early version of the design is pictured here the @entity29 - based team came up with the app during @entity18 ’s @entity31 and is currently working on a prototype			1
‘ when we were first conceptualising @entity9 , we aimed to build a tool that simply “ opened up the heavens ” to the seven billion - plus here on @entity4 , ’ said developer @entity41			0
‘ as the product developed we began to realise an even greater potential : one that allowed children to witness spectacular events millions of light years away at the exact same time as @entity18 scientists , a privilege never before recognised			0
’ the @entity51 app is powered with data from @entity18 ’s @entity53			2
the data from this network reveals the coordinates of celestial events as they happen in space			2
after learning the physical location of the cosmic event , a @entity12 interface is combined with @entity62 to come up with a real - time visual map of space			1
an algorithm is used to to pick out interesting features , such as supernovas , which are visually mapped on the app. a @entity29 - based team came up with the app during @entity18 ’s @entity31 and is currently working on a prototype			1
the app is powered with data from @entity18 ’s @entity53			2
scientists input data they want to share with other scientists and the servers send out the data to other telescopes in various locations			0
@entity9 aims to use that data in a ‘ @entity82 - like platform where people all over the world can follow what is happening in the skies at all times			0
’ without an astrophysicist on board , the team spent a large proportion of their time trying to find out what the telemetric data collected from @entity18 meant , according to a report in @entity96			0
after find out the physical location of the event , the @entity12 portion of the app is paired up with another @entity1 product : @entity62			0
the team combine @entity62 ’s interface with telemetric data from @entity4 to come up with a real time visual map of space			2
after learning the physical location of the cosmic event , a @entity12 interface is combined with @entity109 to come up with a real - time visual map of space			1
an algorithm is used to to pick out interesting features , such as supernovas , which are visually mapped on the app @entity116 , the team project leader told @entity96 users experience the ‘ celestial event in space ... as close to real time as we can			1
’ the team have now created an algorithm is able to automatically track events that people are interested in			0
mr @entity126 believes visually replicating space events in real - time is vital to promoting space research to a younger generation			2
the team hopes to have a working app available ‘ sooner rather than later ’ for mobile platforms .			0
