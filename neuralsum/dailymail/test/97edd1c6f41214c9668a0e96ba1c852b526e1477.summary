prehistoric man sketched an incredible array of prehistoric beasts on the rough limestone walls of a cave in modern day @entity6 36,000 years ago			1
now , with the help of cutting - edge technology , those works of art in the @entity9 have been reproduced to create the biggest replica cave in the world			2
the manmade cavern named the @entity15 has been built a few miles from the original site in @entity18 in @entity6 and contains 1,000 painstakingly - reproduced drawings as well as around 450 bones and other features			1
it is the oldest known and the best preserved cave decorated by man , but is not open to the public and is only seen by a handful of experts every year , in order to keep the precious works of art safe			1
now experts have scanned the original drawings using @entity54 techniques to capture each marking and position them correctly on the bumpy replica walls to the millimetres			1

specialists used @entity54 and anamorphic techniques , the latter of which is used to shoot widescreen images			1
using a high - precision scanner , a three - dimensional digital model of the cave was created			0
experts first modelled the cave ’s continuous surface and then made it fit the new space accordingly			0
they took 6,000 digital photos of the artwork , allowing it to be copied accurately			0
images were placed on the corresponding computerised cave - walls before being transferred onto the physical replica			2
the new cave also includes replica paw prints of bears , bones and details preserved in the original cave			1
