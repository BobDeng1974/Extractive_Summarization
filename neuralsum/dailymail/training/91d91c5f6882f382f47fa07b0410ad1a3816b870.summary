the @entity0 make have taken place 100 years ago , but it seems we still do not know all the secrets of life fighting in the trenches , or the full scale of the horror the troops faced			2
a new collection of images documents long - forgotten caverns and quarries across @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , and @entity17 where soldiers from both sides sheltered , carving haunting figures and faces into the soft rock walls while they hid from the bombs above			1
the quarries , which were used as underground cities and contain human remains , are preserved almost exclusively by local residents while many of them are unknown to the wider public and even to historians			0
the quarries often connected to the trenches above , and became established fighting bases for thousands of men			0
journalists who visited them during the conflict describe chapels carved into the rock , fires lit underground , and rooms strewn with straw for men to sleep on			2
haunting : photographer @entity42 spent months locating these quarries , which were turned into underground cities by soldiers during the @entity0 , and are littered with artworks carved into the walls buried : the location of the hidden cities , and the artworks within , have been all but lost to historians and the wider public , except for local landowners and mayors who work to preserve them carving out history : while men sheltered in the dark from the deadly shells above , they were able to use simple tools to carve into the soft limestone walls , creating works of art and poignant tributes hush : while some of the carvings were made in quarries , others were left daubed along tunnels left behind by sappers trying to bury explosives under enemy lines - and listening out for troops coming the other way , which could spell death secret : dr @entity42 , who works a day job as a physician , spent months building up a network of local landowners and mayors who were able to lead him to the tunnels and the carvings within forgotten : often soldiers used abandoned mines for shelter ( left ) setting up hiding places underground away from the shelling ( right ) safety : while sheltering underground , many troops left behind carvings , while others drew on the walls in pencil ( pictured ) one @entity99 trench system incorporated a medieval quarry more than seven miles long , filling it with a bakery , a butcher 's , electric lights , telephones and a machine shop			1
they even gave the passages street names and engraved them on the walls to stop people getting lost			1
among the stranger inscriptions are those made by the 26th ' @entity109 after @entity110 entered the war in 1917			0
the raw recruits decorated every inch of one cavern in @entity13 with portraits of @entity116 , alongside caricatures of the @entity118			0
some of the artworks were also left on narrow tunnel walls carved out by the infamous sappers of the @entity0 who dug tunnels under enemy lines to plant explosives , made famous in @entity127 ' book @entity128			1
@entity110 physician and fine art photographer @entity130 has captured more than 2,000 images of the forgotten shelters , and is publishing them in a new collection called @entity134 he said : ' the project gives us a glimpse into the individual humanity of soldiers who refused to be silenced in the face of modern mass destruction			0
' men from both sides defied the inhuman scale of modern life and declared themselves as human beings who could think and feel and express and create , and who remind us today that they were here and that they once existed as living , breathing human beings			0
' hidden : a set of stairs leads down into some of the underground caverns which were used by soldiers as shelter during @entity0 striking : dr @entity42 said the tunnels and works of art they contain often appeared as if they had been carved recently , with the pencil marks on the walls appearing fresh ( pictured , a reinforced tunnel which forms part of the new photography collection ) digging deep : some of the underground communities were so well established that electronics were even connected , such as this device , which resembles a modern - day telephone receiver sign of life : this vent poking up above the ground is the only outward sign of the network of tunnels buried beneath honoured dead : the collection of photographs also contains images of war graves in @entity13 in tribute to the men who gave their lives there			1

soldiers incorporated medieval quarries into trench systems , *complete* with chapels , bakeries and butcher 's shops
one @entity99 quarry *included* street signs carved on the walls to stop troops getting lost in seven miles of tunnels
limestone walls could be easily carved using simple tools so soldiers left behind engravings and drawings
